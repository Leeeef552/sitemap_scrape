In Friday's session the stock jumped 9 cents to 75 cents with 105.6 million traded despite the company emphasising in a reply to a query from the Singapore Exchange that the talks could lead to nothing.\n\nPenny stock activity involved familiar names such as Mirach Energy, Asia Pacific Strategic Investments and Charisma Energy, while in Friday's session Accordia Golf Trust stood out in the actives list when it rose 4 cents to 81.5 cents with 22.4 million traded.\n\nCosmosteel Holdings' shares were sold off on Thursday when the company disclosed that two of its senior officers including its chief executive had been interviewed by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau. On Friday, the stock managed a modest rebound during the day but finished with a half cent loss at 38.5 cents with 4 million traded.\n\nIn its report released on Friday on the local banks, ratings agency Fitch said Singapore's competitive and mature domestic market continues to motivate the local banks to diversify and expand overseas.\n\n\"Loan growth has been high in recent years and Fitch expects regional growth to gradually increase the banks' risk profiles, as operating and regulatory environments in many emerging markets are still developing and the Singapore banks have modest capacities to compete with more entrenched domestic banks in these countries,\" said Fitch. \"However, the banks have generally been disciplined in their offshore expansion thus far.\"\n\nIn its latest Economics and Strategy Viewpoint, Schroders said it has trimmed its global growth projections for 2014 and 2015 to 2.6 and 2.8 per cent, respectively, a sluggish outlook by the standards of past cycles.\n\n\"The 2014 downgrade reflects some base effects from a poor first half and modest cuts to H2 in the US and Eurozone,\" said Schroders.\n\n\"For 2015, we believe structural headwinds will persist, not least a weaker supply side performance in the US due to adverse trends in demographics and productivity. We see past disappointments on US growth as more fundamental than just a consequence of unfortunate events.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Furthermore, the networking sessions, friendships and getting together with peers, partners and colleagues across the corporate world in Singapore is always a highlight.\"\n\nThe team has also enjoyed playing on some of the top courses across Singapore.\n\nJoining Mr Rahman (System 36) in the team are Alvin Lim (14), Jeremy Yong (10), Lester Tan (12), Tee Siong Swee (8), Martin Watson (9), Tracey Woon (14), Joey Chang (10), James Lye (9), John Lim, Grace Tan (System 36) and Chris Chew (8). Mr Rahman doesn't single out any particular player who has made a big contribution to their current placing of fifth on the ladder after four rounds, but explains that it is a very cohesive team who goes out with the intention to enjoy and play their best.\n\nAnd this cohesiveness has certainly remained consistent over the years. After finishing 23rd out of 25 in the League's inaugural year in 2010, the team bounced back in 2011 to finish in sixth place. In 2012 they were seventh and last year finished second behind winners Team SunMoon. \"Last year's result was awesome - we had a strong team and targeted a top five finish,\" says Mr Rahman.\n\n\"To come in second place definitely exceeded our expectations. We have a very good team again this year but with the rule changes in place, it is hard to tell how we will perform. In any case, we always give 100 per cent effort to ensure we do as well as we can.\"\n\nHe adds: \"While we won't reveal our strategy, we will stick to fielding our experienced team members whom we know can not only handle the heat and pressure, but also have fun along the way.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is not surprising given the weakening in non-landed private home prices, say analysts.\n\nLanded residential DC rates were left untouched as were the rates for industrial use. For commercial use, DC rates were raised 1.9 per cent on average.\n\nDC rates - which are payable for enhancing the use of some sites or building bigger projects on them - will go up by an average of 9 per cent each for two use groups: one which includes hotels and hospitals, and the other, places of worship and civic and community institutions.\n\nThe increase in the latter use-group is thought to have been supported by prices attained in the sale of sites by the state for temples and churches in locations such as Sengkang, Woodlands and Punggol.\n\nAs for the 9 per cent average hike in hotel DC rates, Donald Han, managing director of Chestertons, said: \"Hotel values have remained fairly inflated in the past six months and that could have led Chief Valuer to raise DC rates. But this is slower compared to the previous hotel use DC rate hike of 13 per cent six months ago.\"\n\nDC rates are revised on March 1 and Sept 1 and stated according to use-groups across 118 geographical sectors. The Ministry of National Development (MND), in consultation with the Chief Valuer, revises DC rates based on current market values.\n\nThe new rates are effective from Sept 1 to Feb 28.\n\nThe drop in the average DC rate for non-landed residential use is the first since March 2012, an analysis by JLL shows.\n\nMND said on Friday that non-landed residential DC rates will fall between 2.8 per cent and 5 per cent in 55 geographical sectors, with no change in the remaining 63 sectors.\n\nThe 5 per cent fall is in Sector 72- Prince Charles Crescent, Alexandra Road and Tanglin Road - and Sector 86 - Telok Blangah Heights, Telok Blangah Drive, Henderson Road, Depot Road, and Alexandra Road.\n\nThe drop in Sector 72 is probably due to the winning bid by a UOL-Kheng Leong tie-up for Prince Charles Crescent Parcel B at a state tender in April being 14.5 per cent lower than what a Wing Tai-led consortium had paid in 2012 for the next-door Parcel A, said market watchers.\n\nFor the commercial use-group, DC rates will go up 5-11 per cent in 26 sectors, with no changes in the rest. The top hike applies to Sector 59 only (which includes Balestier Road).\n\nThe sale of strata commercial units at Balestier Towers in July is thought to have provided evidence for the hike.\n\n\"As knock-on effects, the neighbouring sectors of 58, 60, 61 and 62 saw 8-10 per cent increases\" said JLL head of South-east Asia research Chua Yang Liang.\n\nSector 115, which includes Woodlands, saw a 10 per cent hike, supported by the recent sale of the Woodlands Square office site, again producing a knock-on effect for the nearby Sectors 113 and 114.\n\nDC rates for hotel use were raised by 7-10 per cent in 116 sectors. Among the sectors that saw the 10 per cent hike was Sector 51, which includes Beach Road. The sale of 700 Beach Road as a hotel redevelopment site is thought to have been used as supporting evidence.\n\nFor the use-group covering places of worship and civic and community institutions, rates were hiked in all sectors - by 8-11 per cent. Among the sectors that saw the top-end rise were 106 (which includes the Fernvale locale in Sengkang), 115 (which includes Woodlands) and 100 (including Punggol).\n\nA 30-year leasehold plot in Fernvale Link designated for Chinese temple development was sold in July at 185 per cent above the land value implied by the then-prevailing March 1, 2014 DC rate, said Colliers International director Chia Siew Chuin.\n\nCommenting on the government's decision to leave industrial use DC rates untouched in all sectors, Ms Chia pointed to mixed evidence at industrial state land tenders over the past half year - with some sites fetching prices below imputed land values based on the prevailing DC rates at the time, while other plots changed hands at above the respective DC rate-implied land value for the respective locations.\n\nMoreover, JTC Corp has trimmed its posted land rents and land premiums by some 5 per cent for the current period starting July 1, 2014, amid mixed manfacturing performance and a softening industrial property market.\n\n\"Perhaps the lack of clarity in the direction of land prices in the industrial property market has prompted the government to monitor the market for a while longer before making any changes to DC rates for industrial use,\" said Ms Chia.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A range of options coming onstream could inspire you to put that Ramly burger down for good - or at least for the time being. BT Weekend explores a few of them\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Aug 29, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nOrigins of Food\n\nInstitute of Nutrition @ One Farrer Park Hotel & Spa\n\n1 Farrer Park Station Road\n\nTel 6363 0101\n\nwww.onefarrer.com\n\nIF you're looking for healthier versions of hawker dishes like chicken rice, nasi lemak and laksa, you'll want to sign up for cooking lessons at the Origins of Food - a new cooking studio that aims to teach people how to cook wholesome food.\n\nOrigins of Food is housed at the new One Farrer Park Hotel & Spa, and is overseen by Chef Kong Kok Kiong and his team. Although the hotel opens next week, Origins of Food starts only in October. Even so, \"We've been working on the recipes for more than a year, since last April - getting the correct weight of ingredients and portions, and coming up with new methods of cooking chicken, like using sous vide,\" says Chef Kong, who adds that it's great to have the support of dietitians from the upcoming Farrer Park Hospital that's attached to the hotel.\n\nHotel catering-trained Chef Kong and his colleague Chef Benjamin Goh will also oversee the hospital's food when it opens in November. For the hospital, a 14-day rotational menu has been planned, featuring four types of cuisine - Western, Chinese, Vegetarian, Ethnic. These dishes will also be taught at the Origins of Food's interactive studio space.\n\n\"It's been a great process, and what I've learnt is that we can replicate the flavours of local food using wholesome and organic products. It's my first time working with a dietitian,\" says the 38-year-old who was last at Resorts World and Marina Mandarin's kitchens. \"We're essentially serving hotel standard food for the hospital.\"\n\nThere is a consumer demand for healthy food, Chef Kong believes, \"But you have to gain their trust in terms of taste. Which is why Origins of Food is also about sourcing for good homemade products,\" he adds.\n\nOrigins of Food is part of an ambitious plan to roll out a number of food outlets, all under the Institute of Nutrition, that's run and managed by One Farrer Hotel & Spa. The hotel opens on Sep 3, while its food outlets - including Origins of Food - will open in October. Because the hotel is in the same complex as the privately-owned Farrer Park Hospital (which opens in November), the hotel also manages the hospital's kitchen.\n\nOn the side of the hotel fronting Race Course Road, besides Origins of Food, the Institute of Nutrition will feature Foodie Square with outdoor seating and food cooked fresh on mobile cooking stations (the Electrolux Libero stations are the only ones in use in Asia), then there is LFS (Local, Fresh, Seasonal) for wholesome deli fare (with a space which seats 50 diners), a takeaway and dine-in \"virtual\" outlet called Owen Road Diner, besides a halal kitchen for the preparation of daily hospital meals once Farrer Park Hospital is operational.\n\n\"The hotel's main restaurant Escape and other outlets are in effect like a big central kitchen, and this enables us to reach out beyond hotel guests to the public through different food concepts,\" explains Richard Helfer, chairman of One Farrer Hotel & Spa.\n\nBrimming over with bright ideas for the hotel's food outlets, Dr Helfer points out that the concepts' viability comes from a captive pool of hotel guests, hospital visitors and the general public, who could be interested in the cooking classes. There is also a team of six chefs who can give demonstrations and conduct food-themed events. \"There are a lot of events we can hold in the Origins of Food space, and the studio with its state of the art technology has been built to cater to that,\" he adds.\n\nThe studio can hold up to 30 comfortably, but it also has live-feed cameras hooked up so that a demonstration can be telecast to the hotel's ballroom of more than 300 people.\n\n\"We've identified chefs who have the charisma and ability to teach as well so we'll constantly have a pool of teaching chefs around,\" explains Ho Wan Jiun, manager of the Institute of Nutrition and F&B Events at One Farrer Hotel & Spa.\n\nThe whole idea is to make learning how to cook fun and accessible, and in fact, a walk-in programme has been devised in October, for people passing by who can see the action through the glass walls - who can just poke their head in to enquire what's going on.\n\n\"For S$50, and if they have an hour and a half to spare, they can learn to make whatever the chef is making and take it home!\" says Ms Ho. And the bonus is that the food will be wholesome and nutritious, which is just what the hotel's entire food concept is built upon.\n\nBy Cheah Ui-Hoon\n\nConscious Cuisine\n\ninfo@ConsciousCuisineAsia.com\n\nTel 9780 1074\n\nYOU'VE heard of a balanced meal. Now take that concept and apply it to Viv Sutanto and Michele Fernyhough's cooking classes.\n\n\"We both teach at the same time, with Michelle giving more input on nutrition, while I'm strong on the culinary side,\" explains Ms Sutanto.\n\nThe duo started Conscious Cuisine a year ago, and are both certified Living Food and Holistic Chefs from the US-based Pure Joy Academy. While both of them are raw food practitioners, they teach mostly cooked food classes, since raw food is only just beginning to take root here.\n\n\"We find that we need to teach the basic concept of healthy eating and cooking, so we try to make it as simple as possible, focusing on nutritional knowledge, so that people know what they're eating and why,\" explains Ms Sutanto, who was previously running The Living Cafe at Balanced Living, and also in banking before she gave it up to pursue her passion.\n\n\"We're dairy-free, refined-sugar free and also gluten-free. We don't teach recipes using red meat, but hormone-free chicken and fish. While we're not 100 per cent raw food, we encourage people to eat raw foods 50 per cent of the time, for the live nutrients and enzymes.\"\n\nThe whole idea is to show people how easy it is to run a healthy kitchen. \"At the same time we want it to taste fabulous!\"\n\nTheir \"Quick Step to Healthy Cooking\" is a popular public cooking class they offer at various venues, while they also give a lot of private classes at clients' homes, and write up recipes and meal plans. While both are from Australia, they have been living in Singapore for years now, and Ms Susanto is part-Asian.\n\n\"That gives me a good idea of what flavours the locals like. The biggest challenge is with the local crowd. It's hard to convert them from eating out at hawker stalls to making their own healthy lunch box,\" she says. \"Once we show them that it's not going to be tedious or take a long time, then that encourages them.\"\n\nRaw foods, for the record, isn't just about eating salads and healthy dressings, but also about sprouting seeds, and dehydrating food. \"It's important to make it sustainable and not be fanatical about it. But both of us had health issues before, and we went down the raw food route. We got better and felt fantastic, which is why we're so keen to pass on the knowledge now,\" adds Ms Susanto, who used to have chronic dermatitis.\n\nRight now, her raw food classes are at beginners' level as participants have to familiarise themselves with the ingredients and equipment, while there's a growing demand for cooked healthy food classes.\n\nBy Cheah Ui-Hoon\n\nAsian Raw Pantry\n\nIN the last two years, there's been a greater interest in raw and living foods and cooking, beyond juicing, which is why Adeline Tan, who started LINSmoodees four years ago, teamed up with Vivienne Loh of Whole Life Consultancy, to start classes in Asian-styled living food.\n\n\"People have started asking for more besides juicing, so we started the Asian Raw Pantry (ARP) series of classes, for Asian-centric raw food,\" explains Ms Tan, adding that in raw and living foods, juices are cold-pressed, and dips and sauces are the staples, equivalent to noodles and rice in the Asian diet.\n\nMs Tan and Ms Loh, who've been building up their own knowledge in the last four years before starting ARP classes, explain that living food is food that's not overly-processed, and cooked between 45-75 degrees celsius, as enzymes are sensitive to temperature. Ms Tan runs the Healing Concierge Studio & Kitchen based at River Valley Point, while Ms Loh also provides craniosacral therapy and vibrational healing, under her Whole Life Consultancy.\n\n\"While there are tons of information on the Internet, our classes condenses them, and participants find it easier to learn when they have a hand in making the food,\" Ms Tan says, adding that it's a major paradigm shift as the average Asian consumer is so used to cooked food.\n\nBut Ms Loh has launched a series of raw vegan dips for retail sale, and today, for instance, Ms Tan and Ms Loh will be giving their last class of the year under the Asian Raw Pantry series. In the class, they'll be teaching how to make starter pesto from green fennel and a broth from tomato and Mandarin orange peel. For the semi-raw main course, it will be marinated raw vegetables and fungus with mung bean noodles (which are gluten and dairy-free), all tossed together.\n\nHaving moved on to teaching raw food, Ms Tan says that she now gives one-on-one tutorials for green juicing for customers who buy blenders from her. \"In our group classes on living foods, Vivienne is the main teacher,\" she explains. The duo met when Ms Loh went to learn more about juicing from Ms Tan and broached the subject of teaching at the latter's studio.\n\nMs Loh says that compared to Bali, Thailand and Australia, the awareness of raw and living foods in Singapore is still quite low, but they've seen interest grow in the last two years. \"We're getting more enquiries and faster feeedback. For today's class, for example, we were sold out in three weeks,\" she adds.\n\nBy Cheah Ui-Hoon\n\nuihoon@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/us-stocks-look-jobs-data-direction", "site_title": "US stocks look to jobs data for direction", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nUS stocks look to jobs data for direction\n\nEconomists expect figures to show country added over 200,000 jobs in Aug\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Aug 31, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nLAST week, US stock indices finished at record highs and completed their largest monthly gains since February, as the American economy regained some of its lustre for global investors and a wave of deal-making continued.\n\nThis week, stocks will likely build on those gains, as long as jobs data confirms the apparent move of the economic recovery into higher gear, and providing the conflict in Ukraine does not escalate further.\n\nSecond-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) grew 4.2 per cent, even stronger than previously thought, helped by a strengthening property market; that strength was confirmed by home-sales reports and another drop in weekly unemployment claims.\n\nBut, despite a record jump related to new Boeing orders, July durable goods orders suggested that US corporations remain unwilling to invest in their businesses.\n\nThat was enough to take some of the spring out of the stock market's step - and that's partly because the mood of investors remains jittery in light of several downturns in 2014 so far and military tensions in so many regions.\n\n\"We still have a market of non-believers,\" said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TDAmeritrade. \"The GDP number, under normal circumstances, is a home run.\"\n\nOf course, the propulsive second-quarter figure also came in the wake of a negative first-quarter GDP report.\n\n\"The trend is what you want to see, but the variance number to number is so great that it's tough to put your faith in one number,\" said Mr Kinahan.\n\nThe most critical economic data remains the monthly jobs report - the August edition of which will appear this Friday, said Quincy Krosby, investment strategist at Prudential Financial.\n\nOn average, economists expect the US Labor Department report to show that the country added more than 200,000 jobs last month, easily keeping up with population growth. The unemployment rate is expected to tick down to 6.1 per cent, and is steadily approaching the 5 per cent rate generally regarded as \"full employment\".\n\nAny surprises in the report could alter the US Federal Reserve's stance at this month's meeting, which will be the last before the expiry of its quantitative easing (QE) programme, Ms Krosby said.\n\n\"They're going to look at data (and ask), 'Are you going to see more hiring?'\" Ms Krosby said. \"If there's more hiring, ultimately you're going to see wage pressure.\"\n\nTo get ahead of price inflation, the Fed will likely begin raising interest rates as soon as wage inflation appears, she added.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the big surprises of the summer was the fact that stocks and Treasury bonds rallied together. This is a rare phenomenon, and the popularity of safe-haven bonds suggests that fears of a major war are coinciding with optimism about the US economy.\n\nAlready, the war in Ukraine is a more brutal and high-stakes affair than most prognosticators' worst-case scenarios. The death toll is rising and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) estimates that at least 1,000 Russian troops are fighting their Ukrainian counterparts. What had looked like a low-grade proxy war fought by ragtag Russian-affiliated insurgents is increasingly looking like the first major cross-border incursion outside the Balkans since Saddam Hussein rolled into Kuwait.\n\nRecently, Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed Ukrainian leaders for the failure of talks and, in an eerie echo of cold-war rhetoric, invoked Russia's nuclear arms as a threat to the West. European leaders, for their part, spoke of imposing more sanctions even as the eurozone economy appears to be smarting from the slowdown in trade with Russia.\n\nIndeed, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi last week indicated he is preparing to loosen monetary policy to stave off recession in the eurozone just as the Fed begins to tighten its policy.\n\nThe world's three largest economies - the eurozone, China and the US - are \"marching to different tunes\", said economists at brokerage Nomura Securities, in a research note. The Nomura analysts forecast a \"solid\" US jobs report, a negative Chinese industrial survey and a rate cut from the European Central Bank (ECB) this week.\n\nThe ECB's rate-cutting and quantitative-easing plans could alleviate fears that hedge funds and mutual funds worldwide will pull back on risky investments with the Fed exiting bond markets.\n\n\"From a global liquidity perspective, QE by the ECB would more than offset the end of asset purchases by the Federal Reserve,\" said analysts at brokerage Credit Suisse, in a research note.\n\nCertainly, corporations seem eager to keep borrowing money and making deals. The latest international mega merger was Burger King's agreement to buy Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons, with the help of billionaire investor Warren Buffett. The deal was yet another example of a \"tax inversion\" strategy where a large US company folds itself into a smaller overseas peer, so that it can move its headquarters offshore and benefit from lower overseas corporate taxes.\n\nIt is a strategy the Obama Administration has decried as unpatriotic; and US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew has planned a Sept 8 speech to address the practice.\n\nBarring disaster in Ukraine, the market has a bullish tone, but is unlikely to go far until the close of the year, said Oliver Pursche, president of money manager Gary Goldberg Financial Services.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Max Lim, president of Singapore Bank Employees' Union (SBEU), said on Friday that the union is trying to have a dialogue with banks to implement the PWM in the banking industry.\n\n\"The National Trades Union Congress is spearheading the PWM through our various union clusters to achieve its May Day theme of Better Workers, Better Jobs, Better Lives. The PWM has a clear wage, skill and career progression ladder,\" he said at the SBEU's 60th anniversary dinner. The SBEU has 6,000 members including general branch members and 33 banks under its fold. The government has supported the move to incorporate PWM for the cleaning sector and a similar approach would be extended to the security and landscape sectors. The PWM is part of a broad push to raise the income of low-wage workers.\n\nMr Lim cited NTUC secretary-general Lim Swee Say as saying recently that the PWM is for all levels and for all sectors. \"The NTUC financial cluster in which SBEU is a partner is trying to have dialogues with the banks to implement PWM for our level in the banking industry. As such, on this occasion, I would like to invite the banks to come forward and have a dialogue with us.\"\n\nThe banks are employing mostly polytechnic and university graduates, he noted. This means that the vast majority of the new employees are officers, managers, executives or professionals. They are beyond the scope of representation and collective bargaining of the SBEU Constitution. Furthermore, the banks are also employing more contract, part-time and temporary workers, said Mr Lim.\n\nStandard Chartered Bank said that it was fully supportive of the PWM. Peter Hatt, its regional head, human resources, Asean, said that the model sets out to raise wages for people in the banking sector through productivity, training and job redesign initiatives.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Each of the RCPS can also be exchanged for ordinary OKH shares at a 20 per cent premium to the volume weighted average price of OKH shares traded on Aug 29.\n\nBut the exchange price will be no lower than a 10 per cent discount to the weighted average price for trades done for the full market day on which the definitive subscription agreement is signed.\n\nShould Chronoz undertake an initial public offering (IPO) exercise before maturity, Zana Capital would have the right to convert all the RCPS into ordinary shares of Chronoz at a 50 per cent discount to the IPO price.\n\nOKH said that the proposed issue is subject to - among other conditions - approval from the directors and shareholders of OKH and Chronoz (if required), the completion of the transfer of 15 per cent of PAL's shares to Chronoz, and the completion of business, legal and financial due diligence.\n\nOKH said earlier that it is buying a stake in PAL to tap the strengths of a fast-growing logistics player with an extended reach to new geographical markets. This will enable OKH to create business opportunities in the real estate market too, the group said in August.\n\nLast Thursday, OKH reported a turnaround in fourth-quarter net profit for the three months ended June 30, 2014. From a net loss of S$2.4 million a year ago, OKH swung back into the black with a net profit of S$30.8 million.\n\nThis came as revenue surged from S$2.1 million for Q4 FY2013, to S$211 million for Q4 FY2014. OKH attributed this to revenue recognised from its Woodlands industrial property, Primz BizHub, which received its Temporary Occupancy Permit in the quarter.\n\nRevenue from providing construction services to third parties and the reversal of provisions for liquidated damages also contributed to the jump.\n\nThis also meant a return to profitability on a full-year basis. After a net loss of S$0.9 million in FY2013, OKH reported a net profit of S$25.9 million for FY2014. This came as full-year revenue leapt to S$223.1 million, from S$24.5 million a year ago.\n\nOKH Global's shares closed flat at S$0.60 last Friday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

I am always spurred on by the value we bring to our customers, whether they are multinationals, small and medium-sized enterprises or consumers,\" he says.\n\nThe senior vice-president and managing director of the logistics giant's regional headquarters in Singapore is not one who prefers to stay put in his office the entire day.\n\nThe 48-year-old is usually out and about visiting one of the company's many service centres around the island to interact with the 800-plus employees on the payroll.\n\nOnce he's done, he even hops on board one of the company's trademark yellow vans to do deliveries with the couriers to understand any challenges that they may face.\n\n\"Communication is the key to ensure our team understands what to do, and so they know that they are empowered to do the right thing for our customers,\" he said in an interview with The Business Times.\n\nThe Singapore permanent resident also occasionally joins his commercial team to visit and do business reviews with customers to better understand their needs.\n\nAt DHL, there is a programme called \"Straight to the Top\" where customers are able to email Mr Vongpusanachai directly. Some of the compliments he receives there serve as a strong motivation for all the staff to keep raising the bar of their service standards, he adds.\n\nMr Vongpusanachai began his career at DHL Express in his native Thailand back in 2003, when he became country manager there. Four years later, he was appointed managing director of Thailand and the Indochina region, overseeing the growth of the business in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar.\n\nHe moved to Singapore with his wife, who is in her early 40s, and two boys, aged 11 and 14, in 2008 to take up his current posting.\n\nIn the six years that he has been in charge here, Mr Vongpusanachai has helped grow DHL Express Singapore's active account customers to more than 22,000. The number of retail service points has also doubled to over 120.\n\nSingapore, he says, has proven to be an attractive business location for top logistics companies and global manufacturers, thanks to factors such as having the right infrastructure and the government's efforts to establish a \"business-friendly and future-ready\" environment.\n\n\"Singapore is of great significance to us and will always remain one of our regional hubs, along with Hong Kong, Shanghai and Bangkok,\" he says.\n\nEyes on Asean community\n\nHe is eagerly awaiting the day when South-east Asia realises its vision of becoming an integrated region once the Asean Economic Community (AEC) is implemented at the end of 2015.\n\nThe AEC's rollout, he says, will make Asean and the wider Asian region much more attractive to foreign investors.\n\n\"As a result of regional economic integration, Asean will have more influence and become a more interesting place to conduct business. In addition to more investment, AEC will encourage free movement in the region of goods, services, skilled labour and capital.\"\n\nHe expects to see emerging countries in South-east Asia such as Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia open up their economies in the wake of the AEC.\n\n\"(They will be) looking to leverage on Singapore's technological maturity to scale up their high-value industries, such as biomedical, aerospace and maritime,\" he says.\n\nSpeedy partner\n\nMr Vongpusanachai devotes a sizeable chunk of his time driving DHL's involvement in its various sponsorship activities.\n\nThe company is the official logistics partner of many household names such as the Formula 1 World Championship, Canadian entertainment company Cirque du Soleil and English football club Manchester United, as well as IMG Fashion Week events around the world.\n\n\"The guidelines behind our choice of partners are that the brands must share similar values with us, and they must have logistics relevance,\" he said.\n\n\"For example, DHL and Formula 1 are both global brands with common values: speed, precision, excellence, teamwork, technological innovation and conquering new borders.\"\n\nEven as he is firmly into his second decade with DHL, Mr Vongpusanachai's priorities remain the same as Day One: to focus on the needs of customers to make them more successful in what they do.\n\n\"This means ensuring seamless delivery and forging strong partnerships to support their businesses. With our global network and local roots, we want to deliver more Singapore brands to the world by supporting the local SME community as they strive to venture overseas,\" he says.\n\nleeuwen@sph.com.sg\n\n@LeeUwenBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Expedia reported an even-larger jump in demand, saying that Labor Day travellers had booked 20 per cent more domestic and international air tickets through its site than they did last year. The increased demand for holiday weekend flights concludes a strong summer for air travel, even as airfare continues to rise and the consumer recovery from the recession remains slow.\n\nAirline ticket prices are notoriously volatile, but they have been steadily on the rise recently. Air travellers shelled out an average of US$88 more for a domestic round-trip flight in the first half of 2014 than they did during the same period four years before, according to data from Airlines Reporting Corp. And they're not just paying the sticker price of the ticket. On average, air travellers paid US$9 more in ancillary costs - baggage fees, on-board food and beverages, frequent flyer deals, and other costs - for each of their trips in 2013 than they did six years before, according to data from IdeaWorks.\n\n\"Price increases haven't hampered travel at all,\" said Virginia Nicholson, a data analyst with the travel site Hopper. \"People are patient and willing to have some flexibility about when they fly\" - behaviour, Ms Nicholson said, that has allowed them to find good deals. But for some travellers, flexibility doesn't necessarily assure a low price.\n\nOne Labor Day traveller, Kim Sieber, was at Reagan National Airport on Aug 29 with her husband John for a flight to Charleston, South Carolina for her niece's wedding. The Siebers live in Warrenton, Virginia, so they would have preferred to fly out of Dulles International Airport, but they flew from National instead to save money on airfare. They bought one ticket using points, and spent about US$300 for the other.\n\nThe price was higher than she'd hoped to pay, but Mrs Sieber was willing to fly anyway. \"It's a wedding, and I need to go,\" she said.\n\nAAA said it will cost an average of US$219 for consumers who bought their round-trip tickets in advance to fly the 40 most popular domestic routes this weekend. That's up US$5 from last year, in line with the 2 per cent increase in the consumer price index over the same period.\n\nAmid this overall price hike, some leisure travellers have been hit particularly hard. Take a trip that would be atypical for a business traveller: A roundtrip flight from a Washington, DC-area airport to LAX that included an overnight Saturday stay. In the first half of this year, the average price for this trip was US$436.60 - meaning that a family of four in the District could expect to pay more than US$1,700 in airfare for a vacation to California, not even including ancillary fees. That figure is up 7 per cent from the same period last year, according to Airlines Reporting Corp.\n\n\"The middle class is being squeezed,\" said Charlie Leocha, director of the consumer advocacy group the Consumer Travel Alliance. \"The person who ends up with the short end of the stick is the leisure traveller and the traveller who doesn't travel very often.\"\n\nJean Medina, a spokesman for the industry group Airlines for America, said that airline ticket prices remain historically low, blaming government taxes and regulations for recent rising prices. \"Air travel remains a bargain. The great news for consumers is that they have a choice of carriers/business models, ensuring that there are options for even the most price-sensitive travellers.\"\n\nThe rise in demand for air travel over the Labor Day weekend is part of a wave of strong consumer spending in some sectors of the economy. Consumer confidence in August was at its highest level since October 2007, according to the Conference Board, a consumer industry group.\n\nYet Americans are opening their wallets at a time when their paychecks aren't getting much larger. In the second quarter, real personal consumption expenditures increased 2.5 per cent, while real disposable income grew by 1.0 per cent, according to the Commerce Department.\n\nAAA attributed the strong demand for Labor Day travel to consumers' willingness to take on debt. \"This year, Americans are more optimistic about their financial situation,\" said AAA chief operating officer Marshall Doney. \"Consumer spending continues to outpace disposable income, indicating that Americans are comfortable using their credit cards to take one last summer vacation this year.\"\n\nMeanwhile, airlines are making more money than they have in years - thanks more to business travellers than to families going on vacations. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

If you have US$100,000 to spare, lots of guts and a healthy heart, and are looking to get away from bustling Singapore, you could find yourself out in space within three minutes.\n\nSingaporeans meeting these criteria could well be adding the tag \"Pioneering space traveller\" to their social media profiles by the end of next year.\n\nUS-based XCOR Space Expeditions is close to making commercial space travel a reality for private individuals through its space shuttle, the XCOR Lynx Mark II, which is slated to whisk passengers out to space by the fourth quarter of 2015. The spacecraft is to take up to four daily flights, with each round-trip taking under an hour.\n\nThe spacecraft, at 8.5 m long, 7.3 m wide and 2.2 m tall, seats only two - including the pilot, which leaves all of one seat for aspiring space travellers on each flight, so being a pioneering space traveller could be a lonely business.\n\nThere will, however, be little time for loneliness. The adventure begins with a horizontal take-off from the XCOR spaceport in the southern Caribbean island of Curacao, with the spacecraft being propelled across the boundary into space - 103 km above sea level - within three minutes, accelerating at the speed of sound.\n\nPlonking down that US$100,000 would have just bought you the seat, but here is why you need some daring and a strong ticker: The pilot will switch off the engine of the space shuttle once it reaches space to go into a glide and to eventually allow for a smoother journey back.\n\nThe spacecraft will hover in space for about six minutes. This is when you experience weightlessness and can view Earth from up high.\n\nOn the descent following, the pilot will perform a \"pullout manoeuvre\", creating the thrill of 4G gravity forces for 10 to 20 seconds. After this, the glide back home will be at a more sedate speed for about 40 minutes.\n\nThe pilot can even customize the descent for you, by steering the aircraft during the return trip towards a particular spot that you want to see from Out There - be it the Grand Canyon or the Great Wall of China.\n\nThe adventure element is heightened by your on-board \"duties\": Yes, even at the price of that ticket, you are not to just sit there. You will be co-pilot, perform navigational tasks such as reading instruments and ensuring that the dials are holding steady.\n\nThe icing on this cake is that you are eligible to call yourself an astronaut after the trip, for having breached the boundary between Earth's atmosphere and outer space, which is more than 100 km above sea level.\n\nNot bad at all for a happening holiday.\n\nSingaporeans who can afford it and can stomach the experience need to contact local company Crystal Time, Singapore's official distributor of Luminox, the Swiss timepiece picked as the official watch of the XCOR pilots and the partner of the American commercial space travel company.\n\nThe week-long Luminox Space Roadshow began on Friday in Orchard Road, where a model of the space shuttle is on display. Pamela Tan, the brand manager of Luminox Singapore, told The Business Times that the company had already received strong interest from three individuals here; worldwide, 300 people have signed up.\n\nMs Tan said those interested will be asked to go for a medical check-up to determine their medical fitness. Heart conditions, in particular, may disqualify one from making the trip. \"If you can't do a roller-coaster ride, for example, then this is definitely not for you!\" she quipped. She said that, as with other adventure activities that have grown in popularity among Singaporeans, the interest in space travel here will peak. \"Especially with the growing level of affluence in Singapore, travelling is proliferating, particularly among the younger generation.\"\n\nThe appeal of travel - the kind that entails just exploring planet Earth, that is - has clearly caught on among Singaporeans. A recent MasterCard study found that the people here venture overseas once every three months, making them one of the most well-travelled in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nSouth-east Asia is the most popular destination among Singaporeans, especially those aged 18 to 24; at 13 per cent, they form the third-largest group of Singaporeans venturing overseas.\n\nThe biggest group of travellers are adults who are single or married but without children, at 43 per cent, followed by adults married with children under 11 years old (26 per cent).\n\nSingle or married-without-children travellers spend an average of S$2,241 a head on their holidays - less than what adults with older and younger children spend (S$4,266 and S$3,160 respectively).\n\nAnother increasingly significant bracket of Singapore travellers are the seniors, those aged 55 to 65. Although they account for just 6 per cent of the market, they are relatively big spenders - S$3,768 a head - possibly because more than half of them travel further afield than South-east Asia, and perhaps also because these retirees or near-retirees have a penchant for the finer things in life.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Still, he sees strong growth in the long term.\n\n\"We're supplementing the Singapore business in a few areas. For instance, we brought in additional actuarial expertise to the company, which will help us become more competitive in our pricing. We are operating on a global basis with predictive models and that should make us better in the motor business.\"\n\nSHC has been fully owned by Ergo since the start of August, after the latter announced in June plans to enter Singapore's insurance market.\n\n\"In the long run, we would like to run South-east Asia (businesses) out of a strong technical hub in Singapore ... the vision for SHC Insurance is that they would become the foundation of that hub,\" said Mr Kleiner.\n\nErgo Asia Management's managing director, Cheong Yue Loon, added that the health and travel insurance segments here are not so well-served and the group is toying with the idea of expanding into these areas.\n\nAlready, Ergo has presence in two major markets - India and China.\n\nThe group has set its sights on South-east Asia, with a focus on the property-casualty business. It currently owns a 25 per cent stake in Global Insurance Company in Vietnam.\n\nTo widen its expansion, the group is looking at Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines. While no detail is given as it is at the primary stage, Mr Kleiner said Ergo has \"a couple of potential leads for acquisitions\".\n\nThe idea to set foot in Asia is inevitably tied to Ergo's operations in \"many saturated markets\", particularly in reinsurance.\n\nErgo, the primary insurance arm of reinsurer giant, Munich Re, has had its life insurance business hit as it has been operating in a low interest rate environment in Germany.\n\n\"One of the key growth areas that we could see is international primary insurance and in that sense, our expansion as Ergo in Asia plays a key role in also bringing growth to the group,\" said Mr Kleiner.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Dark clouds are hovering over it, presenting rich pickings for cash-rich coal producers and investors on the hunt for a bargain.\n\nHowever, this will take some time to bear out as the industry waits to ride out the bottom of the cycle. Observers add that the industry is also awaiting more regulatory certainty from the new government of Joko Widodo, or Jokowi, as he is popularly known.\n\nDemand for thermal coal - of which Indonesia is the world's largest exporter, controlling 40 per cent of the total seaborne market - is seen to be in structural decline, as costs of alternative energy sources such as shale gas fall and as environmental policies become stricter in countries like China and the US.\n\nAdd to this scenario the ballooning supply of coal: US coal exports are growing, Indonesia is stepping up production and Colombia is boosting output to a record this year.\n\nScott Dendy, the Asia-Pacific head of McCloskey Coal at IHS Energy, said: \"Prices have been declining for over two years now, and there is little further cost-cutting that can be done. To this end, we believe prices are near the bottom, but there'll probably be a few false dawns before stable recovery emerges.\"\n\nIn Indonesia, the consolidation will weed out the less efficient or over-leveraged operators, he said.\n\nAlberto Migliucci, chief executive of Petra Commodities, a boutique investment advisory firm in mining and oil and gas, agreed, and predicted a wave of mergers and acquisitions (M&A), with the cash coming not just from corporate cash hoards but also from personal wealth.\n\nSingapore companies are among those rolling up their sleeves for the action.\n\nIn July, private-equity player Tembusu Partners invested US$7.5 million in Param Mitra Coal Resources Pte Ltd. The companyholds two operating coal mines in Kalimantan with a resource base of about 500 million tonnes.\n\nMr Migliucci said: \"Private-equity players are experts at sourcing assets when they're relatively cheap . . . A lot of the Asian private-equity guys - whether out of Hong Kong or Singapore - are looking.\n\n\"Financial investors are selective in buying coal assets as the down-cycle could last longer than expected . . . so there may be a bit more time to wait before we see full steam on the M&A front.\"\n\nFirst, there needs to be certainty.\n\nErlend Engelstad, a senior analyst at brokerage firm Marex Spectron, noted that president-elect Jokowi has pledged to improve transparency in his government and to ease regulatory pressure for exporters.\n\nCoal represents about 14 per cent of Indonesia's total exports. The commodity, which accounts for 40 per cent of all power generated globally, is mostly produced and consumed domestically; the seaborne export market makes up only 14 per cent of global demand.\n\nWith China taking stricter environmental measures - it will ban all coal use in Beijing by 2020 to rein in the city's bad-air days - and supply continuing to expand, short interest in coal players has built up.\n\nFinancial data provider Markit said the average short interest in US coal firms such as Walter Energy Inc and Arch Coal has surged in the past 11/2 years, and stands at 3.85 per cent of outstanding shares.\n\nMarkit analyst Simon Colvin said: \"In the ever- shifting debate on future sources of energy, few sources of energy have fewer friends than coal. The once-ubiquitous commodity has lost popularity in a world increasingly focused on reducing the environmental cost of energy production.\"\n\nBut try as they might to reduce carbon intensity, policy-makers will find it hard to change their countries' energy profiles significantly without compromising on their economic competitiveness, said Standard & Poor's in a July 21 report. The ratings agency thus expects demand for coal, especially in India and China, to continue to grow in absolute terms in the next five years, although at a lower- than-historical rate.\n\nIn the short term, the situation looks dismal. The supply glut that has driven coal prices to their lowest since 2009 will more than double from 6.8 million tonnes this year to 14.9 million tonnes next year, said Morgan Stanley in a July 8 report.\n\nMiners such as Vale and the Peabody Energy Group are starting to cut supply.\n\nBut Peabody's chief executive Gregory Boyce expressed optimism during a conference call in July, saying the firm is starting to see signs of rebalancing, although seaborne coal markets remain over-supplied.\n\nHe said: \"More than 2,000 smaller mines (in China) are expected to close by 2015, as the growing amount of Chinese coal production is uneconomic.\"\n\nOut of the rubble left behind by the pressure of low coal prices will arise new - and perhaps bigger - players. Petra's Mr Migliucci said: \"Within six to 18 months, we'll see much more consolidation, and the coal sector will be a different place from now.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A pending inspection regulation would bring ships more in line with trains and trucks that carry similar cargo. Growing volumes of shale oil that's made the United States the world's biggest energy producer moves through inland waterways on ships almost twice as long and that carry 10 times the load of vessels plying the same routes in the 1960s.\n\nExport traffic on the Houston Ship Channel in 2013 rose 8.8 per cent to a record 109.2 million tonnes. Towing vessels or barges were involved in 1,852 accidents and other mishaps nationwide last year, up 4 per cent compared with 2012.\n\n\"More traffic is indicative of more opportunities for things to go south,\" Steven Nerheim, director of the Coast Guard's Vessel Traffic Service for Houston-Galveston, said on Aug 4. He added: \"You're dealing with 100,000-tonne things.\" A March 22 collision in the Houston Ship Channel, which closed the country's largest export gateway for three days, spilled 168,000 gallons of oil from a barge, making this year the worst since at least 2008, when 286,653 gallons were lost from tank barges, according to a July 30 report by the Coast Guard and AWO. There were 17,529 gallons spilled last year.\n\nAIS is required in Vessel Traffic Service zones, the busy waterways monitored for ship traffic by Coast Guard staff who watch radar and advise pilots, and has been voluntarily installed by other operators, said Jennifer Carpenter, executive vice-president of AWO. The group also is pushing the government to publish a towing-vessel inspection regulation that was authorised by Congress in 2004 and has yet to take effect.\n\nBased on Coast Guard data, the radar technology requirement is expected to cost the industry about US$69 million to comply, including capital costs, installation and training, said Ann McCulloch, a spokesman for the waterways group.\n\nAdapting an existing safety management system in line with the pending inspection rule would cost about US$15,000 per company, while the cost of creating a new, approved safety management system would range from US$61,000 to US$150,000 per company, Ms McCulloch said. - WP\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Airlines usually get a discount from such prices on large purchases.\n\nJAL said it expects to take delivery of the Mitsubishi aircraft in 2021, while the Embraer 170 and 190 aircraft will start being delivered in 2015.\n\nThe Japanese airline's key domestic rival All Nippon Airways has already ordered 25 MRJ planes, becoming the first customer to buy the aircraft.\n\nMitsubishi Aircraft was founded in 2008 as a plane manufacturer and plans to release its first model in 2017. The state- backed Mitsubishi jet project will compete with small aircraft produced by Embraer, Canada's Bombardier, as well as jets designed by Russian and Chinese firms.\n\nIt will be the first commercial passenger aircraft in four decades - and the first jet - to be developed in Japan.\n\nJapan has in the past developed a turboprop plane, the YS-11, which was the only one built domestically since World War II. It made its debut flight in 1962 and production ended in 1974.\n\nThe Mitsubishi plane will have 70 to 90 seats and be equipped with the new energy-saving \"geared turbofan\" engine designed by US-based Pratt & Whitney.\n\nIncluding the order announced on Thursday, Mitsubishi has secured orders for more than 400 of its regional jets, the minimum required to make the project profitable, the Nikkei business daily said. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

Our society's focus on getting a degree is unbalanced. For many people it has become a paper chase - a tick box exercise which does no one any good. Education is a great benefit but it should never be the most important factor when hiring. The ability to relate to our fellow human beings is far more valuable to an employer than a degree. That is why I would encourage more SICC member companies to give greater weight to a candidate's character, values, skills and potential and less to whether or not a candidate has a degree.\n\nLaletha Nithiyanandan\n\nManaging Director\n\nTalent Design Potential\n\nTHIS is a necessary evolution as Singapore matures as a society. Our government has taken the first step by merging the graduate and non-graduate schemes in the public sector.\n\nBut this transition will take time because employers, parents and society as a whole have been ingrained in their thinking that having a university degree provides higher value and progression.\n\nAs an employer, I think that some form of continual learning is essential for employees to stay relevant, current and thrive in the workplace. All employees, whether they have a degree or not, still need to be committed to ongoing learning in order to stay competitive.\n\nThe biggest contributor to this culture change is the employer. Employers need to demonstrate that they are willing to reward employees fairly based on the value they offer by reviewing their current hiring and compensation processes to give equal weighting to capability and experience.\n\nRussell Tham\n\nPresident\n\nApplied Materials South-east Asia\n\nAS the global leader in precision materials engineering, our pipeline of talent needs to be equipped with highly specialised skillsets to develop and build cutting-edge products that help drive the worldwide semiconductor industry.

We believe this is the predominant philosophy in most global multinationals as well.\n\nIn Singapore, this is an opportune time for the public and private sectors to progress towards a more egalitarian form of meritocracy where competencies and performance are most important.\n\nA fulfilling and rewarding lifelong career should never be limited by academic qualifications; it should be determined by core values, skills, learning agility and results.\n\nMax Loh\n\nCountry Managing Partner\n\nErnst & Young LLP\n\nTHE conventional definition of talent and success that is premised purely on paper qualifications is slowly losing relevance in today's globalised world where diversity of talent is highly valued.\n\nEven in the regulated professional services sector, where minimum qualifications are needed to enter the profession, it is clear that high-performing teams are the differentiators as a result of harnessing their mix of skills and experiences to develop innovative solutions and drive enterprise value.\n\nA shift in mindset and education and hiring values will be important in embedding a broader notion of talent, which can come in all forms.\n\nHaving said that, hiring and reward must continue to be driven by one's merits in contributing to business goals even as employers strive to be inclusive. Also, there must be genuine acceptance in society that there are many pathways to success, including entrepreneurship. The successes of many of our homegrown entrepreneurs are not always founded on qualifications but rather a combination of personal qualities, skills and experiences.\n\nPhilippe Huinck\n\nPresident and CEO\n\nMedical Supply Services Division, International SOS\n\nITALIAN Renaissance diplomat and writer Niccolo Machiavelli once said: ''Whosoever desires constant success must change his conduct with the times.''\n\nCorporate cultures cannot be changed, only shifted. Neither can a culture shift be mandated or always require a 360-degree approach. At times, it may just need slight adjustments to achieve the desired outcome. I believe a successful culture shift will be more effective by leveraging existing cultural strengths within the organisation.\n\nBeyond the job title and pay raise, employees need to recognise that increased responsibilities will always mean higher expectations from management. At the same time, employers must value staff and develop them according to the core purpose of the organisation, ensuring that they grow in their knowledge, both in theory and practice.\n\nThe nature of our work at International SOS means we respond to world events as they happen, so we look for individuals with a can-do attitude, who are creative and thrive on challenges. Our job opportunities are diverse and include medical careers for doctors, nurses, medics, pharmacists, public health experts and occupational healthcare professionals.\n\nAs long as an individual has the right knowledge and skillsets specific to their job, coupled with a compatible personality fit, he or she is more than qualified for career advancement.\n\nLeong Soo Yee\n\nHead\n\nACCA Singapore\n\nIT is encouraging to note that the government has served as a catalyst for change by taking the first step to close the gaps in career prospects for both graduates and non-graduate civil servants. This sets the tone at the top and a push towards a change in paradigms. No longer will there will be a preoccupation with university degrees but a genuine appreciation of all the factors that make a successful employee. To complement this, Singaporeans from all walks of life must also change their mindsets in order for us to move towards a culture that recognises both skills and university degrees.\n\nOrganisations can take the cue from the government to change their culture and policies so that individuals of all skills and qualifications are recognised. Though changing an entrenched culture does not happen overnight, organisations can start with baby steps in the direction of culture change.\n\nWe need to acknowledge that both technical expertise and soft skills are becoming increasingly important ''must-haves'' for employers when hiring new staff. This can be reflected in a concrete way by tweaking an organisation's recruitment criteria, remuneration policies and performance appraisal systems to give more recognition to skills and on-the-job performance track records.\n\nOrganisations can also implement the use of competency frameworks as a guide to hiring skilled and qualified staff. A strong message will then be sent out to pave the way for an organisational culture that embraces diversity and recognises the actual contributions of employees, regardless of their academic status.\n\nCynthia Stuckey\n\nManaging Director\n\nForum Asia-Pacific\n\nMANY of the people leadership skills needed to succeed in the global workplace are not taught or given enough emphasis in the university. Soft skills such as the ability to give feedback and to motivate, coaching, strategic thinking, effective delegation, and customer focus play second fiddle to technical skills, which are the prevailing focus of formal education across all levels.\n\nFunctional or technical skills are important but it is people leadership skills that differentiate high performing individuals, leaders and organisations. And while we would all agree that learning these skills even before entering the workforce would be useful, it is never too late to start.\n\nThus the government's call for an integrated system of education, training and career progression merits the strong support of the academic, social and business communities to ensure that all Singaporeans achieve career success not only here at home but also overseas.\n\nThis effort requires the commitment of many, including the smallest unit of society - the family, where parents play a key role in cultivating the right mindset and values in their children.\n\nOnly then can we foster a culture that values skills and the contributions people make over degrees and titles, giving rise to a generation of Singaporeans who are confident and primed for challenging cross-border business environments.\n\nVictor Wong\n\nArea & Development Director for APAC\n\nSmall Luxury Hotels of the World (SLH)\n\nIN my view, the travel and hospitality sector in Singapore already embodies the new employment culture that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong raised during his National Day Rally speech.\n\nIn many ways, good skillsets and experiences are equally valued alongside qualifications. We see the focus of internships weaved into the hospitality-related tertiary courses. Within the industry, we do see very capable leaders rise the ranks to the management level even without university qualifications.\n\nThe travel and hospitality sector might be a unique one. As for other industries, continued (re)education is crucial to shift Singaporeans' mindset to embrace a new employment culture where skills are valued as equally important to university degrees. Sharing more success stories about Singaporeans who have carved out a niche for themselves based on their skills and experiences will also help encourage the society in the paradigm shift.\n\nIngrid Sidiadinoto\n\nManaging Director\n\nUPS Singapore\n\nAT UPS we agree that there are many routes to success. In fact this is an ingrained part of our ''promote-from-within'' corporate culture. Forty years ago, David Abney joined UPS as an 18-year-old university freshmen loading trucks. Today, Sept 1, 2014, he becomes CEO of UPS.\n\nSpending decades at one company is pretty rare nowadays. But it's not all that unusual at UPS. And that's because we believe that we grow not only by investing in our business, but also in our people, regardless of their role or education.\n\nFor skills to count as much as diplomas, companies must implement training and HR initiatives that level the playing field and help employees develop those skills that are most valuable to the organisation.\n\nOur most effective leadership development programmes are rotation schemes where employees are transferred across departments and geographies to deepen their holistic understanding of our operations and broaden their skills base.\n\nNatalia Shuman\n\nSenior Vice-President, General Manager\n\nEMEA & APAC\n\nKelly Services\n\nUNIVERSITY degrees have regularly been perceived as a passport to success but recently there has been growing emphasis among employers to evaluate candidates based on other factors.\n\nWhile having a university degree is likely to help candidates get a foot in the door, most companies are increasingly looking beyond traditional metrics and also considering factors such as internships, overseas experience, cultural fit and relevant skillsets when making hiring decisions.\n\nKelly Services has, for instance, been collaborating with Temasek Polytechnic where we run a career centre to invigorate studies with working experience. Students who show keen interest and do well during their course will then have the opportunity to carry out their industrial attachments with us.\n\nThe recommendations proposed by the ASPIRE (Applied Study in Polytechnics and ITE Review) committee are good steps to further encourage this kind of culture in Singapore. To make this initiative truly successful, government and schools must ensure that the skill upgrading programmes are relevant, affordable and accessible, especially for those who are currently working.\n\nEmployers are likely to appreciate the real work experience and recognise the value of the certifications if candidates can show that their skills have been developed in a meaningful, strategic and structured way.\n\nEhsan Mesbahi\n\nDean (Singapore), Chief Executive Officer\n\nNewcastle University International Singapore\n\nEDUCATION providers will play a significant role in the Prime Minister's vision of a new employment culture in Singapore. As the public and private sectors shift to a more holistic view of employee value, continuing education opportunities which are relevant to advancing science and technologies will be fundamental to the development of skills and talent in the workplace.\n\nProviding an equal platform for access to such programmes is crucial in order for skilled, non-degree holding employees to not be left behind.\n\nUniversities and other higher education institutions will need to constantly adapt to offer industries specialised training and education programmes which are in tune with strategic objectives of industrial stakeholders as well as being flexible, not only in terms of schedules to help students meet dual work/study demands but also in terms of intake criteria.\n\nWe are seeing an increasing number of industry leaders identifying and nurturing talent through skills development and further education.\n\nNewcastle University International Singapore, for example, provides higher learning programmes to employees from industry leaders such as Keppel Corp and Sembcorp Industries not simply for education's sake, but to equip employees with relevant skillsets to meet their potential and progress in their careers.\n\nYeoh Oon Jin\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nPwC Singapore\n\nBY introducing practical policy changes to reward non-graduates in the civil service, the government is taking the lead in steering this shift to recognise skills and performance rather than just paper qualifications. They are the largest employer in Singapore and this is a positive step to initiate the change. It now rests upon other employers to do the same.\n\nAt PwC Singapore, we certainly welcome this ''new'' employment culture. We have always adopted a well-balanced approach in recognising talent and the value they bring to the firm, regardless of their academic feats.\n\nFor example, we hire non-graduates and provide equal promotion and developmental opportunities for them to up-skill and achieve the necessary competencies and qualifications. Our remuneration philosophy is to reward according to performance and to offer career progression based on skill and merit.\n\nAlthough gradual, I am upbeat that the shift will take place as our performance-driven economy continues to evolve.\n\nDavid Crammond\n\nFounder & CEO\n\nMaachu Pte Ltd\n\nIT is heartening to hear that Singapore is now shifting to a new culture where the emphasis on skills count as much as university degrees. Academic qualifications should only be one of the many criteria which define a person's ability.\n\nIt would certainly be too myopic for employers to judge a prospective employee based on his paper qualifications and not take into consideration his relevant skillset, character and aptitude for the job. Many entrepreneurs such as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs have proven that securing a degree is hardly a prerequisite to success.\n\nPlacing too much emphasis on university degrees is a mistake that is seen within the recruitment industry. Often, job seekers will tailor their resumes to suit the job descriptions.\n\nAt Maachu, we have developed a unique job matching technology which reinvents the online recruitment market and the way we recruit talent. The solution combines proprietary talent pooling and algorithms with a systematic method of profiling critical job criteria relevant to both employers and candidates.\n\nPaper qualification is one key basic entry point requirement. Acquiring new skills along the way is just as critical. It is therefore important for workers to continually upgrade their skills to perform better in their jobs so as to move up the corporate ladder.\n\nMichael Smith\n\nCountry Director\n\nRandstad Singapore\n\nSINGAPOREANS have traditionally been embroiled in a paper chase, believing that higher academic qualifications will lead to better and more stable job opportunities. However, with more organisations becoming flatter and leaner today, there has been a shift in the mindset that prioritises education over experience.\n\nEmployers today are looking beyond an individual's academic achievements and are seeking the experience and transferrable skills that can help in the development and growth of their organisation.\n\nThe new ''employment culture'' will encourage young Singaporeans to think outside of the box and pursue vocational skills in areas that play to their natural strengths - instead of choosing to go down the traditional higher education pathway purely because of the belief that this will get them a better job.\n\nIt will take some time before Singapore gets fully acquainted with the notion that skills matter as much as university degrees. However with the current efforts by the government, private sector and labour unions to promote the acceptance of non-graduates in the workforce, the shift towards this new employment culture can take place sooner rather than later.\n\nPatrick Liew\n\nManaging Partner\n\nGlobal Enterprise Exchange\n\nWE should help enterprises set up what is known as a corporate university. The purpose of such an institution is to help them provide lifelong and upgrading learning programmes to their workforce.\n\nThis is a strategic tool that is widely leveraged upon by many great companies such as General Electric and is an important part of developed economies.\n\nA corporate university with a relevant hands-on curriculum can help enterprises enhance lifelong learning, knowledge management and change leadership on both organisational and individual levels. It can also help improve corporate governance, productivity, and results.\n\nPerhaps the government can apportion resources to help enterprises launch and tap on this best practice. It can also encourage and empower local universities to provide such services, especially to SMEs so that they can compete and succeed in the new economy.\n\nEnterprises can also explore running a corporate university on their own, as a strategic alliance, or in partnership with a business consultancy.\n\nJonathan Asherson\n\nRegional Director, Asean and Pacific\n\nRolls-Royce\n\nIT will take a long-term and concerted effort by the government and private sector as well as the general population to effect such a culture shift, but with the endorsement of the national leadership and the strong signals given in the National Day Rally speech, the intent to change is there. Now it is up to us to heed the call and take those first steps.\n\nBusinesses need to evolve in the way they recognise, reward and develop talent. Parents need to understand and embrace the different ways one can define success. Collectively we need to keep an open mind and recognise individuals' skills and personal inclinations.\n\nUltimately this will be driven by business needs and not all roles are best served by degree-holders - the time spent obtaining a degree may sometimes be better spent learning real skills on the job and through other dual-track pathways.\n\nTan Poh Lan\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nFortis Healthcare Singapore\n\nHEALTH care is one industry where truly, a degree is not always a fast track to a successful career. For allied health positions such as nurses and therapists, as much emphasis is placed on attitude, skills and experience as on paper qualifications when it comes to hiring and promotion. In health care, we value the people themselves, their commitment to patient care and passion for service excellence.\n\nForging a skills-based employment culture will take time. Ensuring equal access to training opportunities and progression pathways for everyone, regardless of academic background, will require structural adjustments.\n\nSocial recognition at the industry and community levels will entail a mindset change. Finally, the definition of ''success'' must transform to one which celebrates meaningful work and enriching experiences over financial rewards. Only with more real-life success stories would young Singaporeans be encouraged to disregard the so-called conventional route.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPLAN-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\nTHE new culture, where skills count as much as university degrees, expands on the definition of meritocracy and takes it to a higher level. In my opinion, it has always been intrinsic to meritocracy, except that in the past, it has been overwhelmed by the emphasis on academic and scholastic excellence.\n\nAlthough overdue, the government's call to employers and unions to join forces with government, to harness industry support and social recognition for people to advance at work, based on their skills, expertise and experience, is a welcome move, and augurs well for Singapore.\n\nThe government has taken the lead to implement this new employment culture, with the swift action taken to merge more graduate and non-graduate schemes, to give a more equal footing, regardless of academic qualifications. Some government agencies such as People's Association and uniformed groups have already been practising this, so the government is not starting from ground zero.\n\nMany MNCs, like those which I have worked for, also have this policy in place, as often when recruiting staff, they specify that they will consider experience and skills, in lieu of academic qualifications. Many of our successful entrepreneurs are sterling and inspiring models of this new culture. Entrepreneurship is their skill and expertise.\n\nOne flanking strategy to make this work, therefore, is to build and entrench an entrepreneurship culture in Singapore. It has to start with our youths. Halogen Foundation Singapore, a not-for-profit organisation, is seeking just to achieve this, by transforming street-smarts - who typically are not academic-smarts - especially those from poor, marginalised and vulnerable families, into business-smarts, through a 30-week structured entrepreneurship programme, in collaboration with Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship from the USA.\n\nThis new culture, when combined with a vibrant and dynamic entrepreneurship culture, can be another powerful pathway to enhance social mobility. The government's lead in embracing this new culture is a critical success factor. This new culture will take root when there are more senior civil servants and those in political office, achieving the best that they can be, without academic qualifications.\n\n(Note: I'm chairman of Halogen Foundation Singapore)\n\nDhirendra Shantilal\n\nBoard Director & Head of Asia-Pacific\n\nFircroft\n\nEVERY successful employer knows the key to hiring well isn't certificates but competence. Certainly, good paper qualifications often indicate the potential for success but this isn't always the case. The Prime Minister's announcement regarding the merger of graduate and non-graduate schemes in the public sector is a large step forward as it will allow graduates and non-graduates to reach management roles, on the basis of performance rather than academic qualifications.\n\nWorking closely with talent across different backgrounds and experiences, we have learnt that success is achieved with better performance evaluations and opportunities for continuous learning regardless of starting qualification.\n\nSo the government needs to spread this conscious cultural shift by working with the private sector to encourage promotion based on performance and also work with education providers to offer employees more opportunities to keep learning. Degree equivalents such as technical certificates that help recognise and expand the skills gained at work should be easily accessible.\n\nWhat is crucial is the capability to learn, adapt, grow and perform in the present and the future rather than the certificate you received in the past.\n\nBrendan Wauters\n\nPresident & CEO\n\nSenoko Energy Pte Ltd\n\nSENOKO Energy is heartened that the government is taking the lead in encouraging companies to look beyond paper qualifications when recognising the contributions of their staff. Senoko Energy has been a longtime firm believer that beyond qualifications, skills development, commitment and on-the-job performance matter just as much.\n\nMr Lim Leong Chuan, our Vice-President in charge of Instrumentation and Control, is one good example of a staff member who has benefited from this. Mr Lim joined the company in 1984 as a unit controller after graduating from the ITE. Over the years, the company has been supportive of his pursuit for career progression through skills upgrading. Mr Lim obtained a diploma, and eventually a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering from NTU (in 1993).\n\nAnother example of our commitment in this respect is Senoko's award of scholarships to deserving applicants, as part of the Singapore-Industry Scholarships (SgIS) administered by the government.\n\nPriti Mehra\n\nManaging Director\n\nMillward Brown Singapore\n\nAN excessive focus on university degrees is a legacy of the past. After all, for nearly three generations, degrees practically guaranteed a job in the field of your study as well as steady career progression.\n\nHowever, today, a focus on skills development will allow employees to achieve their personal goals by charting their own course through an organisation. I fully back Prime Minister Lee's observations regarding the need for an integrated education system, and believe that with government and industry support, alternatives to a university degree will not only become socially accepted, but also will be recognised as a serious choice for individuals who want to maximise their potential.\n\nFrom an employer's perspective, we need to take a holistic view and look at candidates' intrinsic ability, performance, creativity, and lateral thinking, instead of using paper qualifications as the only filter. Additionally, organisations need to put in place programmes enabling employees to continually broaden their skillset. Continued up-skilling leads to a high performance environment, helping organisations, in return, to achieve their strategic goals.\n\nSeah Kian Peng\n\nCEO (Singapore)\n\nNTUC Fairprice Co-operative Ltd\n\nAS a major employer in Singapore, NTUC FairPrice's philosophy in talent management has always been to develop and nurture potential to enhance the long-term employability of our staff.\n\nApart from educational qualifications, we value qualities such as dedication, commitment and experience among other virtues. As part of our holistic approach towards staff development and to enhance skills and knowledge, we provide training and capability development. This includes equipping them with skills from professional courses provided by recognised institutions and helps to empower staff with confidence in the role and function that they play.\n\nIn addition to training, we provide flexibility for staff to be rotated or transferred to various departments. Recognition and opportunities for career progression to recognise their contributions are also in place to serve as motivation. With such a structure, we are proud that many of our staff have risen through the ranks, including some serving in senior management positions.\n\nChris Mead\n\nRegional Director\n\nHays in Singapore & Malaysia\n\nTHIS may be a big shift for many employers, but the key to remember is that it is skills and experience that employers look for when they recruit above the entry-level. While graduates find that their degree can help them land their first entry-level job, it is experience and rapid expansion of their on-the-job skills that would chart their career progress.\n\nSo perhaps a starting place would be for graduates and universities to understand the value of hands-on experience, which is viewed highly by potential employers.\n\nOne way to do this is to encourage students to do work placements or internships during their studies. This allows students to prove and enhance their skills in a real job, with real targets and performance expectations.\n\nEmployers should allow interns the chance to add real value to the business so that when they graduate and look for a full-time job, they have some proven on-the-job successes to share with a potential employer.\n\nRecruiters can also work with employers to identify the candidate who has the appropriate skills and experience needed to do the job, not just a certain degree or qualification. Ultimately it is a person's technical skills, not what they studied, that allows them to succeed in a job.\n\nJianggan Li\n\nCo-Founder and Managing Director\n\nEasy Taxi Singapore\n\nTHE main challenge is changing people's mindset on education and the value of a university degree.\n\nIn our hiring process, we have encountered a lot of good candidates (whom we eventually hired) who do not possess university degrees. While it does help to have one, companies also look into a candidate's skills and experience. Ultimately, it's not the degree that brings success, but the person himself.\n\nWhat we've noticed is there are so many candidates with great potential who think they have limited capabilities because they do not possess degrees. To bring out the full potential of these candidates, we need to initiate a cultural shift.\n\nThe Internet industry is also disrupting many traditional trades. We are offering people an opportunity to perform and be judged by their achievements rather than qualifications.\n\nKelly Kuhn\n\nPresident, Asia-Pacific\n\nCarlson Wagonlit Travel\n\nCARLSON Wagonlit Travel supports and is already practising the principles of the Prime Minister's recommendations. We hire people based on their work knowledge, skills and competency rather than which university they graduated from.\n\nWe have partnered with the polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education to speak to their students about job opportunities as corporate travel consultants and provide an overview of career opportunities at CWT. We also offer internship programmes to their students interested in travel management, and have a management trainee programme in place for interns who have proven their skills to join at an entry level and further their career.\n\nIn order for Singapore to move towards a new culture, we believe greater awareness is required about the career path provided by companies which offer occupational-skilled jobs, alongside success stories of companies with non-graduate employees having fulfilling career opportunities.\n\nAnnie Yap\n\nManaging Director\n\nAYP Associates Pte Ltd\n\nIT would take more of a top-down approach, especially from the public sector, to change the importance placed on a university degree. The public sector has always been very stringent in hiring only the cream of the crop of each cohort, degree holders with a high GPA.\n\nHence, it is vital that the government set the example of gradually placing more emphasis on the importance of skills, rather than academic results alone, to enter the civil service.\n\nFurthermore, with two more universities due to be opened by 2020, increasing the number of students entering university to 40 per cent, skills would naturally become the differentiating factor as a degree no longer becomes as relevant.\n\nLikewise, the curriculum of the new universities can be more skills-based to set the tone on the importance of skills. However, as with all mindset shifts, the changes will be only gradual. Hence we do not expect employers to disregard the university degree in the near future.\n\nMin Chow\n\nManaging Director\n\nLEWIS Singapore\n\nOUR experience as a PR and digital consultancy has proven that paper qualifications alone are not sufficient to secure a job or progress. For entry-level candidates, we look for the ability to manage multiple projects and lead teams. For mid-level candidates, we look at the depth of work experience and developmental potential for senior roles.\n\nAs such, we view candidates with or without a university degree on an equal footing as the focus is on the relevant work experience, soft skills, and work ethics. Career advancement is based on merit and we help progress talent through initiatives such as overseas secondment, region-wide training workshops, and a bi-annual 360 feedback system.\n\nThe private sector stands to benefit from taking the public sector's lead and adopting similar bold changes that put all employees, regardless of paper qualifications on equal footing, by rewarding talent based on job performance.\n\nMuch remains to be done to cultivate this skills-based employment culture of inclusiveness and equal opportunity through training and development.\n\nPhilip Yuen\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nDeloitte Singapore\n\nWE recognise that diversity of talent is crucial and while we want intellectual rigour, it is important not to rely purely on academic results as a benchmark. There are many exceptional individuals who have remarkable achievements beyond academic qualifications and need opportunities from organisations to help them succeed.\n\nFor instance, Deloitte's membership in the spexBusiness Network for Athletes provides us the chance to hire national athletes and it has benefited us because our employees, athletes and non-athletes alike, can interact and share with one another different unique skills, mindsets and experiences that are mutually enriching.\n\nBeyond this, it is also important to take into consideration the attitudes and expectations of Generation-Y employees. In a study released by Deloitte in January 2014, millennials are set to comprise 75 per cent of the global workforce by 2025, and they want to work for organisations that foster innovative thinking, develop their skills and make a positive contribution to society. If we want to attract and retain talent, organisations will need to be innovative and in tune with their employees.\n\nSam Yap\n\nGroup Executive Chairman and Co-Founder\n\nHtwo Investment Holdings Pte Ltd\n\nTHE Prime Minister's National Day Rally speech on emphasising skills over paper qualifications and alternative routes to career success was well-received by many.\n\nHtwo Holdings applauds this creative and practical move. In fact, Htwo Holdings has been practising this ''employment culture'' for a while already. As an organisation, Htwo Holdings has always paid attention to our employees' skills and experiences in the recruitment of manpower.\n\nAs much as academic and professional qualifications are important to gauge the person's capability and potential, we also take into consideration the employee's skillset and past experiences which will support his job function and achievement of targets set for him. An employee without paper qualifications but with vast work experience and good work ethics and attitude can perform just as well as or better than those with a degree.\n\nAs employers, we must be open-minded about this to bring out the best in our staff. They are rewarded through their overall work performance and achievements for the company with career progression tracked for them.\n\nFor Singapore to move towards this culture, a multi-pronged approach involving employers, unions and the potential market of employees is needed. In my mind, the more important goal in achieving this ''shift'' would be the widespread social recognition of a worker's career advancement based on skills and motivation to better himself through continual education and training. Good examples could be highlighted in the media to give motivation and added push to those without the paper qualifications but who aspire to do better.\n\nChristophe Duchatellier\n\nCEO\n\nAdecco Asia\n\nSINGAPORE'S employment culture is a diverse mix of various talents. As it strives to remain a global centre for international business and research and development, graduates as well as employees must realise that constantly upgrading their skills, learning new knowledge and adopting creative mindsets, is a necessity.\n\nThere should be a shift in the social mentality that succeeding at the ''paper chase'' is not enough. Organisations want to hire motivated and adaptable employees with relevant skillsets.\n\nAt Adecco, we also firmly believe in training and career progression. Countries like Singapore, with limited resources, can get a stronger competitive advantage from training its workforce, regardless of age, experience and entry level.\n\nDeveloping a successful and fulfilling career has to be seen as continuous lifetime training. Degrees and qualifications are one way to enter the workforce, but career progression is best achieved with a well-managed training strategy.\n\nShawn Balakrishnan\n\nGeneral Manager\n\nThe Hoffman Agency Singapore\n\nSKILLS will always be valued by businesses. The question is, will non-university certified skills be similarly valued? Yes, but only if businesses back up their verbal support with actual action - putting their money where their mouth is.\n\nThe Prime Minister mentioned the excellent calibre of graduates from polytechnics, ITEs and other non-university institutions, and while businesses often express verbal support for these graduates, the only way Singapore can move forward in terms of solidifying an ability-based, meritocratic business culture is by businesses leading by example and matching their verbal support for these institutions with action.\n\nThis can come in many ways, but partnerships that provide hands-on industry experience is an excellent start.\n\nThe Hoffman Agency, for instance, partners Ngee Ann Polytechnic, mentoring students in an introductory PR programme. Such partnerships provide the credibility, experience and show of belief from businesses that these institutions may benefit from, while simultaneously giving businesses the opportunity to talent-spot and increase their talent pool.\n\nChris Comer\n\nCEO\n\nCastlewood Group\n\nI MUST say that I definitely agree with PM Lee Hsien Loong's view that a university degree isn't the only way to a successful career. At Castlewood Group, we have long been an avid believer in the abilities and capabilities of our staff rather than focus on their academic background.\n\nWhat we have witnessed, especially among our sales division, is that our top performing staff tend to be those who have certain life skills and high emotional intelligence - something which cannot be taught at university. That said, we do value further education, and particular skillsets and accreditation are required for particular industries, so we support our staff in their ambition and regularly sponsor their education.\n\nEmpowering and educating staff is vital not only for their personal development, but also allows the company to evolve and progress. At Castlewood Group all staffers are provided with mandatory in-house training, regardless of previous work experience or educational qualification. We always like to promote within and recognise the achievements of individuals to acknowledge and reward great work done on-the-job, rather than hedge our bets on employees' future potential according to their university degree.\n\nThe proposed cultural shift is a welcome change and will depend hugely on the support of employers. The first thing that needs to be done is to remove the stigma attached to not possessing a degree - this age-old attitude is still very prevalent here, so it is up to the government and trade unions to look for a change in mindset. A fully-devised plan should be put in place, such as persuading employers to pledge a certain amount of non-graduate placements, run regular internships, or provide work experience opportunities for candidates who have expressed an interest unrelated to purely academia.\n\nOnce the plans have been laid, it is down to the taskforce to actively promote and bring awareness to the scheme such as running regular job fairs, that will give candidates the opportunity to not only get in front of potential employers, but give them the encouragement to pursue what they want to do to improve both in their jobs and in life.\n\nMark Billington\n\nRegional Director, South-east Asia\n\nICAEW\n\nTHERE are over 142,000 ICAEW Chartered Accountants in the world, many working at the highest levels of business, practice and government. A significant number of these members do not have a degree and underwent the ACA qualification to attain the required knowledge, skills and workplace experience needed to succeed in accountancy and finance.\n\nThough having a gold standard qualification opens doors, what sets our members apart is their ability to marry deep technical knowledge with real job experience, tied together with a firm foundation in ethics. They are rewarded and recognised because of what they can bring and apply to the workplace - and not simply on the basis of their qualification backgrounds.\n\nPeople from a variety of backgrounds bring a valued diversity to the profession which cannot be overstated. We champion opening access to the accountancy and finance sector. We recognise the value of offering different routes to the accountancy and finance profession and that is why we recently partnered with Singapore Polytechnic to offer diploma students an accelerated route to chartered accountancy.\n\nWe have also seen an increase across many markets in non-degree students taking the ACA and students in Malaysia topping the international ACA examinations ahead of a global cohort of whom many graduated from prestigious universities.\n\nTo answer this week's question, we do not believe that Singapore should move to a new culture where skills count as much as university degrees. We believe that Singapore must move to a new culture where people are evaluated by their contributions and achievements. This will help us maintain our competitiveness in a highly complex and fast changing world.\n\nRoland Smith\n\nVice-President and Managing Director of APAC\n\nCenter for Creative Leadership\n\nREGARDLESS of degrees, this is about building capabilities for Singapore.\n\nSkills will be viewed as much as university degrees when we acknowledge that universities are not the only places where meaningful skills are developed.\n\nThe Prime Minister gave several examples of continual training given to employees in the workplace, and while they are a great start, they are still the exceptions rather than the norm.\n\nTraining in the workplace must, first of all, be widespread among Singapore corporations for a skills-attuned business culture to develop. Secondly, it has to transcend the generic and be personalised in order to be effective, incorporating the employee's feedback to create a personally-effective developmental programme. Thirdly, the type of training provided has to eventually reach beyond individual skills and into leadership training, thereby providing individuals with not just the ability to be self-skilled, but to lead and guide others to do the same - within their roles in the workplace, family, communities and beyond.\n\nAll these can be achieved when each and every one of us recognises and develops learning agility, and actively pursues lifelong learning with a growth mindset.\n\nLeslie Ong\n\nCountry Manager, Singapore\n\nVMware\n\nFORTUNE'S top 10 fastest growing companies for 2014 are businesses that have proven that having an innovative scalable idea could be the starting point of a multi-billion-dollar setup. It is interesting how the growth of these conglomerates also proves that success is not limited to only those who have won accolades from the world's most reputed universities.\n\nAs a country that propagates technology, innovation and entrepreneurship, the balance between skill development and university certifications is certainly a step in the right direction. Our youth need choice and avenues that can help promote the spirit of innovation, growth and entrepreneurship. This can only be achieved by harnessing the right skillsets.\n\nAt VMware, we are committed to creating a stronger IT workforce. Aside from our strong focus on innovation, we invest in enabling IT practitioners with specialist skillsets and certification programmes to keep up and keep ahead of the dynamic technology trends. Today, VMware Certified Design Experts (VCDXs) are part of an elite group of architects leading virtualisation implementations around the world.\n\nSingapore has proven that technology can enable a stronger and a productive workforce and we are committed to partnering in the nation's efforts at building a Smart Nation and a Smarter Workforce.\n\nSuhaimi Salleh\n\nCEO\n\nSSA Consulting Group\n\nWE feel the call by PM Lee to embrace a new employment mindset and culture marks a watershed in the history of Singapore's human resource policies and practices. This shift is quite tectonic in nature with widespread effects. They impact the education and manpower ministries, industry partners, employers, HR practitioners, education/career counsellors, parents and students.\n\nYet, it will take some time for all parties to internalise, react and adjust to the changes that lie ahead. SSA Consulting Group employs both graduates and non-graduates. However, it does not employ different schemes of service for its employees. It has, all along, been giving equal importance to qualifications and skills in its recruitment policy. Like most employers, SSA values the formal pre-employment training and industry exposure that a potential candidate has.\n\nThe company rewards its staff based on the value-add that each employee brings, his/her actual performance, irrespective of seniority and qualification.\n\nDora Hoan\n\nCo-Chairman/Group CEO\n\nBest World International Ltd\n\nALL along, skills are valued by employers who are really interested in long-term development of their businesses. As job applicants are normally strangers to the recruiter, their qualifications are the only evidence of their skills, typically acquired at university.\n\nWith a buffet of candidates from all over the world offering more advanced skills, employers would also seek to optimise their costs by hiring the most skilled candidate at the lowest cost.\n\nNevertheless, the recommendations by the Aspire committee would be beneficial for Singapore to truly move towards a skill-oriented culture. The work-and-train programme and structured internships can allow the employers to truly assess potential employees instead of just relying on the paper. These provide a win-win solution whereby employers can run the businesses with qualified employees while the latter can be allowed to shine.\n\nRobin C Lee\n\nGroup COO\n\nBok Seng Group\n\nI AM glad that our country's leadership recognises the importance of this issue and it is timely now to tackle it as in the years to come, a big and growing fraction of our Singaporean core population will be graduates.\n\nWithout this culture shift, there will quite certainly be an acute shortage of Singaporeans willing to take on ''non-graduate'' roles. People must be remunerated not only for their academic achievements or qualifications but also the technical skills, experience and work ethics they possess.\n\nWhy should a well-trained 750-tonne mobile crane operator, who has gone through all the tough training to obtain Class 3, 4 and 5 driving licences before finally qualifying for crane operator certification, be paid less than one doing accounting, sales or marketing? One could be using more mental than physical labour, but in my opinion both types of work require good training, diligence, commitment and attitude.\n\nSo, yes, while having a degree is nice, a technical certificate or diploma is equally respectable if hard work has been put in. People doing all types of work must be respected for their contributions and character; the rest are strictly secondary.\n\nI foresee the shift to a new culture where skills count as much as a university degree, unburdened by the conventional interpretation of social status by jobs. From young, we have been warned over and over by our parents and seniors that if we fail academically, we are doom to become garbage collectors. A scare tactic with good intention perhaps, but it does not impart the right values. A university degree need not be the only path to a fulfilling career. Instead, good solid skills acquired through training or experience should count as much. I welcome this paradigm shift in the culture and hope that such positive change can be sustained.\n\nZaheer Merchant\n\nRegional Director (Singapore & Europe)\n\nQI Group of Companies\n\nA MINDSET change needs to take place for skills to count more than degrees. But the initiatives currently being emplaced by the government are a good start on that path. The ''paper chase'' has long been the ultimate goal but recognition is slowly creeping into all stakeholders' consideration (be they employees, employers or educational authorities) that in today's world, certain specific or broad-spectrum inter-disciplinary degrees may not stand an individual in good stead for the world.\n\nGermany's apprenticeship programmes are a prime example of honed hard skills being well regarded without any stigma attaching to the lack of a paper-qualification, but also as a successful trade/vocation for an individual. A degree inculcates analytical thinking and reasoning, but without experience, it is plainly and simply a degree.\n\nIn a 2012 article, Forbes reflected on a ''jobless'' generation where 60 per cent of graduating students could not find full-time employment in their chosen professions without required ''skills''.\n\nClearly, lifelong learning of core, critical and specialist skills is key in the new work culture. The workplace has adapted for global competitiveness. It's time we all do so too, or face a ''pain point'' by a slide in competitiveness.\n\nEric Hoh\n\nVice-President\n\nSymantec, Asia South\n\nTHE continued evolution of the Internet landscape has created a pressing need for cybersecurity experts. The Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore recognises this, and is taking steps to increase the number of cybersecurity professionals in Singapore at both degree and diploma levels, enhance the skills of ICT professionals, and develop a pool of postgraduate researchers.\n\nAt the same time, there is room for the industry to provide more internship opportunities for those looking to join the field, both locally and overseas. The opportunity to test their security skills within a unique and real world environment is invaluable, and offers an education that goes beyond academic qualifications.\n\nTo keep pace with what has now become an omnipresent threat, businesses need to recognise that their focus should go beyond hiring top talent, to grooming the next generation of leaders to lead the charge against cybercrime.\n\nDavid Leong\n\nManaging Director\n\nPeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd\n\nA DRASTIC mindset shift in education. A strong and emphatic advocacy on apprenticeship programmes in technical education. Setting standards for continuous learning and recognising those competency standards and Workforce Skills Qualification certification. All these are the needed ingredients for the change in education formats.\n\nThe ASPIRE panel is not saying that a degree is not important anymore. It is surely not saying that a degree won't get you ahead. A degree is a mark of one's academic journey, a milestone. I personally think ASPIRE is about providing more pathways to young Singaporeans to achieve success and map their academic journey at their own pace, and not necessarily getting a degree or diploma first. That can come later but with skills training, they can still get a respectable job and decent pay. These are important premises.\n\nI think this initiative led by the government is very liberating for many students - those who are keen to get ahead but who do not wish to be labelled ''normal'' or ''technical'' - a label that can have great impact on their career development. The multiple pathways advocated by the government means they can achieve success through a skilling programme that is incremental and that they can also climb the wage ladder.\n\nLearning is continuous and does not necessarily culminate with a degree for us to be deemed ''successful''. Removing the fixation on academic qualifications will help a great deal. This will hold a new promise for non-graduates and tell them that skills can weigh as much as academic scores now and they can get comparable pay if they can perform. It used to be that an ITE certificate leads to a dead-end road. That has changed. There will be more stopovers in the career journey to allow individuals to upgrade and skill up with time and to remain relevant to the job market and get recognised and paid correspondingly.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/weak-data-puts-pressure-abenomics", "site_title": "Weak data puts pressure on Abenomics", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nWeak data puts pressure on Abenomics\n\nHousehold spending fell by 5.9% y-o-y in July, factory output rise stayed weak at 0.2%\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Aug 29, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTokyo\n\nPRIME Minister Shinzo Abe's Abenomics policies suffered a further blow to their credibility on Friday, as household spending in Japan slumped by just under 6 per cent in July compared to a year earlier - twice the level expected - in the wake of April's sales tax hike while factory output remained weak.\n\nOther data for July showed that consumer prices rose by 3.3 per cent compared with a year earlier, suggesting that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is on track to meet its 2 per cent annual inflation target by around the middle of next year. But with prices rising faster now than wages, real incomes in Japan are declining, dimming the outlook for consumer spending.\n\nThe unemployment rate in Japan meanwhile edged up from 3.7 per cent in June to 3.8 per cent in July - a further potential dampener of consumption - although the jobs-to-applicants ratio remained near a 20-year high of 110.\n\nMinister for economic and fiscal affairs Akira Amari suggested after the release of generally disappointing data that there was no need for excessive pessimism. Finance minister Taro Aso argued that the adverse impact of April's sales tax hike is gradually easing, although he added that the situation demands \"close monitoring\" from here on.\n\nAnalysts generally took a dim view of prospects for the world's third largest economy, however, arguing that it faces the risk of declining again into a downward spiral without fresh moves to stem the adverse trend of the past two months towards falling demand and output, at home and overseas.\n\n\"Production and consumption are both stagnating, and the economy is clearly undershooting projections of the government and of the Bank of Japan,\" senior economist Taro Saito at NLI Research Institute in Tokyo was quoted by Reuters as saying.\n\nTokyo stock prices were largely unchanged on Friday with the Nikkei 225 share average closing fractionally lower on the day at 15,424.59, after suffering more substantial declines earlier this week in anticipation of a drop in household spending.\n\nComing on the heels of recent news that Japan's economy contracted an annualised real rate of 6.8 per cent in the second quarter of this year - the biggest drop since the country was hit by a devastating earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 - Friday's data could impact sentiment quite badly, analysts said.\n\nThe heavier and longer-lasting than expected impact of April's hike in consumption tax from 5 per cent to 8 per cent is, meanwhile, expected to put pressure on the BOJ to come up with further monetary easing measures when the central bank's Policy Board holds its monthly meeting next week.\n\nThe deteriorating situation in household spending will also make it difficult for the government to go ahead with a planned further hike in the sales tax to 10 per cent with effect from October 2015 - and that in turn could put further stress on Japan's already highly strained fiscal situation.\n\nHousehold spending fell by 5.9 per cent in July from a year earlier, nearly double the drop predicted in media polls, while weakening demand for Japanese exports - in some parts of Asia as well as in Europe - led to an accumulation of industrial inventories.\n\nFactory output rose by a much lower than expected 0.2 per cent in July, according to Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (Meti).\n\nManufacturers said in response to a survey by the ministry that they expect factory output to rise by 1.3 per cent in August and 3.5 per cent in September. But a Meti official said on Friday that there was no certainty on whether production will rise as companies have continued to overestimate demand.\n\n\"Production in July had been expected to jump, compared with a significant decline in June, but it did not see a sharp recovery due to sluggish shipments. Nevertheless, inventories have further piled up,\" a ministry official said.\n\nCore consumer inflation (excluding prices of fresh foods but including energy) was up by 3.3 per cent in the year to July, the same rate as in June and in line with market forecasts. Stripping out the impact of April's sales tax hike, the rise was 1.3 per cent, and the BOJ expects it to accelerate later this year.\n\nWage data due next week will show whether the drop in real household incomes implied by the latest inflation figures is likely to continue, analysts said. BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda appealed last week to Japanese firms to raise wages further when he spoke at a central bankers' meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Debbie Yong highlights three of them. Jaime Ee, meanwhile, tries out a punch detox\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Aug 29, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSpinacas\n\nwww.spinacas.com\n\nTel 97707039\n\nSOME days, you want a salad and you want it fast - without having to ponder over 40 possible topping permutations, and will that blue cheese dressing really go with that lemongrass chicken?\n\nFitness fanatic Phyllis Chua has been there, so she's keeping things simple at her year-old healthy salad delivery service Spinacas.\n\nBuyers only get a choice of two sizes of salad, a regular at S$11 and a petite at S$9, with a fixed set of toppings such as baby spinach, pickled red cabbage, hard boiled egg, broccoli, cheese, nuts and a homemade dressing.\n\nThe only thing you pick is the protein component, which ranges from meats such as a fiery Moroccan spiced chicken cooked for 12 hours, pulled pork cooked in a cinnamon-tinged stock and then tossed in barbecue sauce, handmade pork and beef meatballs and vegetarian tofu patties or ratatouille. At least 100g of meat is included in each order, and they are served warm and packed separately.\n\nAnother special feature at Spinacas: their salads are entirely free of carbohydrates such as breads and pastas, and are suitable for those on the paleo diet.\n\nIt was an eating habit that Ms Chua had gotten used to after a sojourn in Spain last year. \"I discovered that good food was a way of life; fresh, whole produce was easily accessible to everyone,\" she recalls. But after having hearty salads for lunch and dinner for two months in Europe, she tried - unsuccessfully - to re-create the same meal experience on her return to Singapore.\n\n\"Salads that were nutritious and hearty just didn't exist. Most of them were too protein-light and carb-heavy, and I would always be hungry by 3pm,\" she observes. So the former architect started making her own salads, always including more meat and cooking them in flavour packed combinations.Friends started requesting it, and Spinacas - derived from the Spanish name for spinach - soon became a full-time occupation.\n\nOrders have to be placed 24 hours in advance and are delivered from 11am to 2pm daily on Ms Chua's red Vespa scooter. Customers can also order and pick up the salads from her commercial kitchen in Pearl's Hill Terrace, says Ms Chua, whose dream is to one day build a fleet of Vespas to expand her delivery network island-wide.\n\nFoodmatters\n\nwww.foodmatters.me\n\nWHAT'S chicken rice and nasi lemak doing on the menu of a health food delivery service? Is this just denial or have our wishes come true?\n\nThe latter, it seems, is happily the case. That's because Foodmatters' founders Alexandra Prabaharan and Cedric Chong believe that healthy meals should be big on taste too. So instead of padding out the menu of their health food delivery service with salads and more salads, they've tweaked the recipes behind some of our local hawker favourites to include them on the menu too. The chicken rice, for instance, comprises oven-baked chicken and brown rice cooked in stock, while the nasi lemak is tossed in nutrient-rich coconut oil rather than coconut milk.\n\nTo truly serve the needs of their targeted working professional crowd, month-old Foodmatters is run as a food subscription service, says Mr Chong. This means that customers commit to buying a fixed number of meals per month, and then pre-select the exact dates they want those meals delivered to their homes or offices using the site's online meal calendar to avoid the hassle of having to pick and pay for their meals daily.\n\nMeal plans start from four meals for S$40 a month to 20 meals for S$140 a month, or S$7 a meal. Only lunch is served for now, and their delivery network currently only serves the central and town areas for now.\n\nThe site currently has 40 dishes in categories such as local, vegetarian, Western and Asian fusion, from which six options will be highlighted daily for subscribers to order. Besides salad bar staples such as hummus wraps and cous cous salads, the menu also spans local favourites such as chicken curry (served with chicken breast meat and thickened with a cashew nut paste and low-fat milk instead of coconut milk), nasi ulam and assam laksa.\n\nEach item has its calorie count, and fat, carbohydrate and protein content listed too. Around five dishes are added and removed each month to give customers some variety.\n\n\"The heart and soul of the business is that we are a subscription service. Eating healthy once in a while will not make you healthier. We need to consistently eat healthy, and our service provides just that,\" says Mr Chong, who is a director of lifestyle and entertainment company, Massive Collective.\n\nKuala Lumpur-based Ms Prabaharan is a certified nutritionist with the American Fitness Professionals and Associates (AFPA) and is mainly responsible for coming up with the recipes for the dishes. She used to run her own healthy lunch delivery and catering service Lunch2u in Malaysia before collaborating with Singapore-based Massive Collective on Foodmatters last year.\n\nThe duo are currently working on expanding the service to Kuala Lumpur in the coming months with a more localised menu for the Malaysian market.\n\nFit Three\n\nwww.fitthree.com\n\nlaunching in October\n\nWHEN was the last time you lamented about being so busy that you forgot to eat? Well, no longer, because the people behind new meal subscription program Fit Three want to feed healthy meals directly to you - even if that means they have to waylay you on your routine gym visit.\n\nFit Three is the latest in a slew of health food delivery services to have launched here in the last six months, but unlike the others which target mainly corporate slaves chained to their desks in the CBD, Fit Three plans to launch their service by tying up with popular gyms and fitness studios.\n\nThe idea is that the outlets will serve as pick-up points where health food seekers can pick up their supply of pre-cooked healthy boxed meals for the rest of the week. Users typically sign up for a subscription through which they can pre-order three to 10 ready-to-eat meals weekly - for both lunch and dinner - and get them delivered in two batches at designated gyms.\n\nDrop-offs are tentatively scheduled to happen on Mondays and Thursdays, which means you can pick up up to six meals on a Monday, for lunch and dinners that last you through to Wednesday, and a maximum of four meals on Thursday, which will last you through to Friday.\n\n\"The healthy options you have today are day-to-day orders that you need to pick up and receive daily, we're looking to provide a an even more convenient option than that,\" says co-founder Arthur de Corbier, who works in project management for a bank. His team comprises four other founders who have mixed backgrounds in market research, information technology and product management. Three others work on Fit Three while one is a part-timer.\n\nFit Three's high-protein, high-carbohydrate but low-fat meals will span a range of Western, Mediterranean and Asian flavours, and will comprise free-range and antibiotic- and hormone-free meats and locally sourced ingredients as far as possible. Meals cost a flat fee of S$12.50 each, \"a higher price than others\", Mr de Corbier admits, because each 500g meal will pack in a substantial 180g to 200g of meats or seafood.\n\nThe recipes will be crafted by a stable of consultant chefs - they currently have a Spanish-trained local chef and a French-trained South African chef on board - and another special feature at Fit Three is an interactive platform on which users can rate each chef's dishes and leave feedback.\n\n\"On most online ordering websites, the chef tends not to have any interaction with the customer so they don't get any information on how well the meal was received. We want to build a link between the chefs and the final consumer so we can modify the menu accordingly,\" says Mr de Corbier. The team will also look into design meals for those with specific dietary requirements such as vegetarians, and those on paleo, gluten-free or dairy-free diets, and phase two of their expansion will include deliveries to home.\n\nAs for keeping food fresh after receiving them in bulk, Mr de Corbier says that most dishes will be tested to keep for three to five days in the chiller, and will have its recommended shelf lives clearly labelled. Excess dishes can be frozen to be eaten at a later date. The team is also exploring the use of vacuum-sealed inert gas packaging to keep food fresher for longer.\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\n@DebbieYongBT\n\nwww.punchdetox.com\n\nIS S$300 a lot to pay for a three-day juice cleanse? Yes. Is it cheaper to buy a S$600 slow juicer and squeeze your own juice on a daily basis? Yes. Is it a pain to chop up a mountain of greens and fruit every day, feed them through the fiddly tube, constantly scraping out the fibrous remains so they don't jam your machine? Oh yes.\n\nThat probably explains why the mushrooming online juice cleanse purveyors seem to have few problems attracting new clientele. It's not hard to be sold on the idea of detoxing your system with assorted fresh juice combinations made with the Norwalk juicer - the ultimate machine claiming to extract every drop of goodness out of everything from carrots to alfalfa, with a three-day shelf life to boot.\n\nWith basically the same juicer and range of greens and fruit, how do you pick one juice shop from another? The product is similar but it's the approach and services that differ.\n\nNewest entrant Punch Detox is the Singapore offshoot of the Hong Kong-based outfit and it boasts a breezy, fun and flexible approach to juicing. You can pick from the S$300, three-day cleanses which get you a total of 18 500ml bottles of juice, or six bottles a day. If you're a newbie, you pick the slightly more fruit-centric package which makes for easier drinking, or the slightly more hard-core package which emphasises greens more than fruit. Alternatively, you can just pick the juices you like at S$100 for six bottles.\n\nDrinking the stuff is easy, even at the second level, thanks to a combination of greens and green apple that's palatable, and because there's so much to drink, you're not likely to feel hungry. Any pangs you might feel would be more out of a habit to chew something solid.\n\nBut one edge that Punch has over its competitors is its gazpuncho - a savoury, chunky gazpacho-like concoction that you can pour into a bowl and eat like soup. The jumble of tomato, cucumber, red peppers, garlic, olive oil and herbs tricks you into thinking you're having a meal. Well, that's the idea.\n\nYou also get encouraging emails from Punch with tips on how to get through the cleanse, written in a friendly, engaging manner. And even if you do cheat a little bit on the cleanse, there's nothing to feel bad about. It's just a way to get more greens into your diet, and while it's not cheap, you certainly appreciate the convenience. Especially when you try going back to your clunky slow juicer after that.\n\njaime@sph.com.sg\n\n@JaimeEeBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Compared to the year before, housing and bridging loans increased 7.0 per cent in July to S$172.6 billion.\n\nCar loans fell 2 per cent month-on-month in July - more than the 1.7 per cent decline registered in June. On a year-on-year basis, car loans shrank at the same pace of 19.9 per cent in July as they did in June.\n\nLoans and advances in Asian currency units (ACU) stood at S$524.4 billion in July, compared to S$524.9 billion in June. The ACU market refers to loans denominated in currencies other than the Singapore dollar.\n\nOn Friday, the central bank also said that the level of RMB deposits totalled 254 billion yuan (S$52 billion) at the end of June.\n\nSaid CIMB economist Song Seng Wun: \"Looking ahead, unless there is a significant change in the macroeconomic outlook, loans growth - especially business loans growth - is expected to just plod along. And because of the high year-ago base, overall loans growth is expected to continue to moderate, to perhaps mid to high single-digit growth.\"\n\nAs for OCBC's Ms Ling, she forecasts full-year bank loans growth to average around 11 per cent year-on-year. Year to date, total bank lending has grown 13.4 per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By May Yip\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Aug 29, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nFOR the average beauty junkie, spending over S$200 for an eye cream wouldn't give rise to a new worry line. Since La Prairie broke the S$1,000 mark with its Cellular Cream Platinum Rare several years ago, the price of skin creams have escalated so exponentially that opting for a face-lift might almost be cost-effective.\n\nBut as the likes of La Mer and Cle de Peau Beaute defy logic with their astronomical price points, more modest skincare marques are touting increasingly impressive formulations. US skincare company Pond's has recently re-emerged here, bolstered by products that contain premium ingredients that could be found in more expensive concoctions.\n\n\"When we did decide to enter Singapore again, as with entry into any other market, it was a decision not based on timing or priority; rather, we had to conduct in-depth research and studies to fully understand the market before making the decision to enter,\" says Umesh Shah, vice-president of Unilever International, the parent company of Pond's. The brand left Singapore in the 1990s.\n\n\"What we discovered was that the Singapore skincare market has grown tremendously in recent times and along with it, the beauty habits of consumers here. Today's consumers are increasingly savvy and experimental with their daily skincare routine, and are on the lookout for skincare products that are both affordable and effective in addressing their skincare needs.\"\n\nThe brand's Age Miracle range, for example, contains active ingredients like CLA (conjugated linoleic acid), often found in supplements to reduce body fat and to stimulate skin cells to promote faster cell renewal. Some products in the range also contain retinol boosters to accelerate rejuvenation and improve collagen production - in other words, fight lines, pigmentation and acne.\n\nHowever, trending ingredients shouldn't be the only criteria for picking up a new potion.\n\n\"There are a lot of products on the market that contain retinol; retinol shouldn't be the only consideration,\" warns Dr David Colbert, a New York-based dermatologist who developed his own skincare line Colbert MD. \"Our Illumino oil, which contains retinol, is unique because it incorporates Qusome technology - Qusomes enable more actives to penetrate further into the skin where they are more likely to benefit new skin cells and less likely to cause irritation.\"\n\nRather than allowing ingredients to sit on the surface of the skin and cause, say, redness - a common side effect of retinol - new skin delivery technology may encapsulate such ingredients within small molecules, releasing them deep within the skin for efficacy. The combination of ingredients also makes a difference in how a product performs, explains aesthetics doctor Georgia Lee.\n\n\"The quality and source of our ingredients and the know-how that goes into the way we design skincare play a big role,\" says Dr Lee. \"Our range of anti-ageing skincare contains patented peptides that have synergistic effects with the chosen ingredients in each product, and is developed based on our understanding of our focus group from our service sector.\"\n\nDespite their lower retail prices, drugstore players such as Pond's, Olay and L'Oreal Paris are backed by massive skincare groups that are also behind more premium brands. Pond's, for one, is owned by Unilever which also happens to be the parent company of high-tech department store brand Ioma Paris.\n\nMr Shah says: \"With a legacy spanning more than 160 years, Pond's is one of the world's most trusted skincare brands, providing women affordable and innovative products. Today, the Pond's Institute has more than 200 patents worldwide and more than 700 scientists located across the globe dedicated to research and development.\"\n\nDon't expect to find the retro Cold Cream that the brand was best known for back when it was on our shores before the 1990s. Instead, it has launched snazzy age busters like the Age Miracle Firm & Lift Targeted Lifting Massager, a facial treatment that is dispensed from a tube with an attached cooling roller to especially target the lower region of the face and jawline for the sought-after \"V-shape\" effect. Its Cell Regen Dual Action Eye Cream comes in a \"yin yang\"-shaped pot, with a pink cream to fight lines around the upper eye, and a white undereye cream to reduce puffiness and dark circles.\n\nWhile the key range for the brand is positioned within the anti-ageing category, it has also unveiled whitening, hydrating and cleansing lines to address other skincare concerns, with prices ranging from S$3.90 for a facial cleanser to S$49.90 for a massaging treatment.\n\nHowever, for those who can't be persuaded to switch their La Prairie for Pond's, Dr Colbert advises: \"Although sunscreens with sun protection factor are one of the most important products a consumer can buy, there are many high-quality, low-cost options. I think the same is true for cleansers. Instead, the smart money is on high-quality peeling serums, facial oils, and moisturisers.\"\n\nHence, at under $4 a pop, a drugstore cleanser might very well be on the shopping list of even the biggest skincare snob.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Hence bigger agencies are unlikely to follow suit.\n\nCurrently, the typical commission payout in the industry ranges from 70-90 per cent, depending on the experience and performance of the salesperson.\n\nUnder HSR's new scheme, salespersons earning 90 per cent commission will be entitled to a 100 per cent commission once they achieve earnings of S$38,000 in a 12-month cycle. Those currently on the entry-level 70 per cent commission will be lifted to the 80 per cent level.\n\nHSR chief executive Anne Tong said: \"We believe that the scheme will encourage our existing salespersons to grow their business together with us and thus increase their take-home income. At the same time, we believe this scheme will also attract other salespersons or new ones to join us.\"\n\nAccording to HSR's illustration, a salesperson who earns a gross commission of S$500,000 would have received a maximum net commission of S$450,000 under the old scheme. But under the new scheme, the salesperson will take home S$496,200.\n\nHSR said that there will be no let-up in support services for its salespersons, such as IT services, operational and administrative support, research reports, legal advice, marketing products and training.\n\nSo far this year, HSR has seen a 21.6 per cent contraction of its agents pool to 1,327 agents. Ms Tong noted that it is possible that some of the salespersons who left HSR may have left the industry completely.\n\nAccording to her, more than 40 per cent of those who resigned were not active sales agents to begin with, as they had not made a single sale since they joined.\n\nOne management executive of a rival firm felt that HSR's new commission scheme \"is essentially giving all its existing team managers a big pay cut\".\n\n\"There may be no more incentive and purpose for these managers to recruit, train, manage and retain. It will become an every-man- for-himself culture,\" said the management executive who declined to be named.\n\nCentury21 chief executive Ku Swee Yong questioned if a 100 per cent commission scheme is sustainable as it requires the management to have a lot of reserves to tide through this period of very low transactions.\n\n\"At the end of the day, the agents must have enough transactions in the market to feed themselves. Then they will continue holding on to their licence and stick with the company,\" he said. \"The reality now is many agents are leaving the agency pool and taking up full-time jobs. Although they are still holding onto a licence, some may have found work with other corporations.\"\n\nMr Ku pointed out that there are also other factors affecting how salespersons choose their agencies, including the corporate branding, systems and processes, working environment and areas of specialisation.\n\nAccording to the Council for Estate Agencies (CEA), the number of licensed estate agencies and registered salespersons has \"remained fairly consistent for the last three years\".\n\nOn Jan 1 this year, CEA had on its rolls 1,425 licensed estate agencies and 31,783 registered salespersons, compared to 1,492 estate agencies and 31,040 salespersons on Jan 1, 2013. In comparison, there were 1,487 estate agencies and 30,577 salespersons on Jan 1, 2012.\n\nThe drastic fall in residential sales has prompted industry players to band together to share resources and leverage on one another's network.\n\nIn July, HSR formed an alliance with SLP International, OrangeTee and Dennis Wee Realty to collaborate on project marketing mainly for local projects. HSR has garnered three new residential projects since the formation of the alliance, Ms Tong said.\n\nShe added that HSR is also expanding its reach to overseas projects, such as those in Malaysia, Thailand, Australia and the UK, and has plans to diversify further into commercial properties.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This announcement came a day after she abruptly cancelled her visit to Myanmar for the India-Asean economic ministers meet where she was supposed to sign the deal.\n\nIndia is already facing criticism for scuttling the World Trade Organization's (WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement. Understandably, the no-show by the minister at an India-specific, three-day meeting in Myanmar raised concern about the country's commitment to the pact and to a global trade regime. Ms Sitharaman said last-minute domestic compulsions prevented her from attending and the official line is that she had to stay back due to the launch of a financial-inclusion scheme to provide every household with a bank account and insurance cover. However, it seems unlikely that such a scheduling mix-up could have happened since the meeting in Myanmar was planned quite a while ago and would have been factored in.\n\nIt is more likely that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi wanted to have a closer look at the ramifications of the deal which was negotiated and agreed to under the government of the former prime minister, Manmohan Singh.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/coal-derivatives-market-expected-boom", "site_title": "Coal derivatives market expected to boom", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nCoal derivatives market expected to boom\n\nSGX and CME recognised as dominant players\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Aug 31, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] The coal industry's ongoing switch from fixed to floating prices in contracts is fuelling expectations of an explosion in the nascent thermal-coal derivatives market.\n\nAnd Singapore, the base for many Asian coal traders, looks set to be the battleground for exchanges to gain market share.\n\nWhen prices headed up in the few years after 2008, miners saw little benefit in hedging. But now, a bearish outlook for coal has boosted interest in hedging as coal producers, reluctant to fix long-term contracts at current price levels, are starting to use shorter-term contracts.\n\nBuyers from China, the largest consumer of thermal coal, also prefer to make purchases in an opportunistic manner - such as when seaborne coal becomes cheaper than that which is domestically produced.\n\nScott Dendy, the Asia-Pacific head of coal data provider McCloskey Coal at IHS Energy, said: \"There has certainly been an increase in index-related physical transaction in the Asian coal market, and this has given rise to an increase in the volumes of exchange-traded derivatives.\"\n\nAlthough coal derivatives have been prevalent in Europe since the deregulation of the electricity market there compelled power- generation companies to hedge the costs of their coal input, hedging has been an alien practice for Asian coal players until recent years.\n\nThe Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the largest futures operator in the United States, was the first to mine this field, launching the Indonesian sub-bituminous futures contract in August 2011, followed by another two since; its first-mover advantage has enabled it to capture market share, said Alan Bannister, its executive director of energy products in Asia.\n\nThe Singapore Exchange (SGX) soon followed suit. Last October, it launched two futures contracts, and added two more in July this year.\n\nWith these, all key thermal coal price benchmarks with Asian centricity will be covered by the exchange, SGX chief executive Magnus Bocker said in May.\n\nThe US-based InterContinental Exchange (ICE) also carries coal futures contracts but in Asia, CME and SGX are recognised to be the more dominant players.\n\nAsia is an important region for coal - the top five coal importers in 2012, all in Asia, are increasingly buying more.\n\nSGX noted that Asia has gone from accounting for about half of seaborne coal demand a decade ago to three-quarters of overall demand today. However, derivatives volume represented only 4 to 6 per cent of the Asian seaborne physical market last year, SGX estimated.\n\nAs the US and Europe clamp down on the use of coal, and with both supply and demand growth expected to come from Asia in the coming decade, Singapore is increasingly seen as an important hub for the trading of coal derivatives.\n\nCME's Mr Bannister said: \"More than half the volume on our Asian coal products come from Singapore; the other big centres would be London and Geneva.\"\n\nParticipants of the coal derivatives market here are largely traders, power gencos and miners, said SGX.\n\nHowever, compared to iron ore - another commodity in which the use of derivatives has grown rapidly in recent years - thermal coal is a more fragmented market. It has multiple source and destination markets, hence the varying price indices that have emerged.\n\nMost of the world's traded coal derivatives currently use API 2 and API 4 as benchmarks for price settlement.\n\nWith fewer coal contracts priced using API 8 and the IHS McCloskey Indonesian Sub-Bituminous Coal index than API 2 and API 4, \"liquidity of the SGX swaps is expected to be limited, even in the case of high price volatility as observed on current markets\", said Xavier Veillard, director of trading and investment strategy at Accenture. \"This is further supported by the fact that producers want to remain naturally exposed to coal price volatility, while utility-end buyers in North Asia typically sell electricity on a cost- plus-regulated price basis, limiting the need for hedging for both buyers and sellers in the region.\"\n\nNevertheless, Erlend Engelstad, a senior research analyst at UK commodities brokerage firm Marex Spectron, is optimistic about the growth of the Asian coal derivatives market. \"The Asian coal derivatives market is still embryonic in respect of the underlying physical volumes, but there is evidence that new products are increasingly adopted among producers and consumers in the Asia-Pacific,\" he said.\n\nThis is also driven by the increasingly volatile prices in the thermal coal market.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Suzanne Brocklehurst\n\nPublished Fri, Aug 29, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nITALY'S art, music and fashion have always attracted global attention and its wines continue to attract plenty of interest. This is particularly the case at the quality end of production. Italy's sheer diversity of wine styles means that it should come as no surprise that of the 30 wines shortlisted in this competition, a solid contingent would be Italian, including four from Piedmont.\n\nThe sense of disillusionment among lovers of expensive top-end Bordeaux meant their gaze has been diverted to Burgundy, inevitably driving its price higher. Suddenly, the spotlight seems to have turned to Piedmont in North West Italy and, above all, the focus is on Barolo. In this manner, it seems only fitting that one of the first wines to be selected as a finalist should be a Barolo - Vietti Barolo DOCG Castiglione 2010.\n\nThe Barolo zone, which can be divided into 11 different sub-zones, covers 1,911ha of vineyards of the red grape variety Nebbiolo. Distinguished as Italy's most revered grape variety, Nebbiolo is capable of making some of the most ethereal wines in Italy. Just as Pinot Noir in Burgundy is prized for its ability to express a real sense of place, Nebbiolo is valued in the Piedmonte for that same ability. Barolo can be one of the most challenging wines to taste in its youth because of the high level of firm, assertive and often astringent tannins that coat the mouth. Nonetheless, with prudent cellaring complex layers of perfume, truffles, spice, tobacco and leather will be displayed on the nose while the flavours can be equally intricate as power and elegance combine.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Later, Australian golf architect E&G Parslow was engaged to design a new layout for the golf course, and the construction began in August 2010.\n\nRenovation was completed on Sept 28, 2012. The same year, Tropicana was awarded the \"Most improved golf course\" by ParGolf Magazine, a golf publication in Malaysia and the Asian region.\n\nMembership at the Tropicana Golf & Country Resort (TCGR) costs RM20,000 for a year, and RM53,000 for three years. The benefits of both can be extended to the member's spouse and a child below 18 years old.\n\nOther membership options are the individual golf membership and the corporate golf membership. They cost RM200,000 each, not including a monthly subscription fee of RM179.30 and a processing fee of RM200.\n\nThe Legends Golf & Country Club\n\nABOUT 70 per cent of the golfers who play at the Legends Golf & Country Club (Legends) are non-Malaysians, but the resort is located in Johor, Malaysia.\n\nOf the non-Malaysian golfers, a majority are Singaporeans, or are expatriates from Singapore, says club manager Amy Cheong. She explains: \"In Singapore, unless you are a member of a club, there are very few public golf courses. A lot of these golf courses don't open their courses to non-members, unless it's a weekday. There are very few avenues for non-members to play.\"\n\nUnlike Singapore golf clubs, the Legends has abandoned its membership policy, thus opening the club to the public. Also, more than 10 years ago, the Legends stopped selling club memberships. \"There was a time when club memberships were being speculated on, but then the bubble burst, and people started making a lot of noise,\" says Ms Cheong.\n\nThere were members of the Legends who were purely speculators and did not play golf at all, she adds. But the club wanted members who bought the membership for the sake of playing golf, and not to speculate.\n\nSecondly, Ms Cheong says, it is more expensive to play at Singapore golf courses. The rates at the Legends range from RM95-250, with the cheapest time to play on weekdays, before 10am, and the most expensive on weekend mornings. Even the more affordable golf courses in Singapore, such as Changi Golf Club, charge walk-in visitors S$90 per 18-holes on weekdays, and S$110 on weekends and public holidays - a steep rate when compared with the Legend's package rates.\n\nAn added feature of the Legends golf course is its offering of Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer designs, which are \"superior\". According to Ms Cheong, people jump at the chance to play at these courses.\n\nNicklaus and Palmer are American professional golfers and designers of golf courses around the world, but most of their designs are available in the US, with the next nearest Jack Nicklaus course in Indonesia. The Legends, just a forty-minute drive from the Tuas Second Link, is a more accessible choice for Singapore golfers.\n\nThe Legends has noticed a fall in golfers from Singapore after additional tolls were implemented at the causeway earlier this month for foreign vehicles entering Malaysia. But according to Ms Cheong, \"it is a short-term effect . . . it is reactionary, after some time, they start playing again\".\n\nBeyond golf courses, the Legends offers other leisure and recreational facilities to accommodate families, such as horse-riding and lake fishing. There is also a beginners course on golf, mountain biking activities, a tree-house and a vegetable garden.\n\nSome golfers stay over at their guestrooms as well, says Ms Cheong. They go on a Saturday, stay over, and play again on a Sunday.\n\nTanjong Puteri Golf Resort\n\nJUST a 30-minute drive from the Causeway, the Tanjong Puteri Golf Resort (TPGR) hosts three golf courses.\n\nThe \"Plantation\" course was designed by golf architect Max Wexler, while the \"Village\" and \"Straits\" were designed by Akira Mamiya. \"Straits\" was designed and constructed to closely resemble the coastline of the Straits of Johor.\n\nSingaporeans make up about 55 per cent of the resort's golf members, which totals around 2,000.\n\nNear the end of the 1990's, TPGR stopped selling life-long full golf memberships. For those who are keen, life-long memberships may be transacted via the secondary market.\n\nBut the resort still sells term memberships for a 1-2 year period at a cost of RM3,800 per year for individuals, and RM6,800 per year for the family package. Upon purchase, members are entitled to unlimited rounds of golf and discounts on food & beverage, and accommodation.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished Fri, Aug 29, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIF you believe Volvo, the guiding philosophy for its new XC90 was focused on just three words - \"designed around you\". When Chinese carmaker Geely bought the Swedish marque from American giant Ford four years ago, Volvo set out on a new direction of attractive design based on a platform that was 100 per cent Volvo.\n\nThe result is the new XC90, the first new car from a new Volvo car company.\n\nThe big sport-utility vehicle was developed around three core values - intuitive user-friendly functionality, world-class safety technology which also protects the environment, and special design and customer service. These were important because its predecessor was enormously successful for blending handsome SUV styling with seven-seat practicality when it was introduced in 2002. The three rows of seats could accommodate adult occupants comfortably while still offering decent luggage space.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Sales inched up a measly 0.2 per cent in the quarter, with real estate, rental & leasing services posting the biggest jump of 5.8 per cent.\n\nHealth & social services rose just 1.6 per cent, the second biggest increase. Financial & insurance services reported 1.4 per cent gain, while transport & storage was up 0.4 per cent.\n\nTurnover in information & communications services remained unchanged from the first quarter.\n\nEducation services took a steep dive in the second quarter, with takings plummeting 16.5 per cent from the previous quarter. Recreation & personal services tumbled 1.4 per cent and business services excluding real estate, rental & leasing services dipped 0.7 per cent.\n\nCompared to the same quarter in 2013, all services industries in the second quarter posted growth, except for business services excluding real estate, rental & leasing where business receipts remained about the same as a year ago.\n\nHealth & social services saw the biggest year-on-year jump in business in the second quarter, with receipts swelling 8.2 per cent. The Department of Statistics says this was \"due mainly to hospitals registering higher receipts compared to the same period last year\".\n\nAmong other services industries that did well were financial & insurance services (+4.5 per cent), education services (+4.1 per cent), information and communications services (+3.3 per cent), real estate, rental & leasing services (+2.3 per cent), recreation & personal services (+2.1 per cent) and transport & storage services (+1.4 per cent).\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Like the bigger Mazda3 and Mazda6 models, the Mazda2 reflects the Japanese carmaker's sensuous Kodo design.\n\nBut whatever the design philosophy, the Mazda2's upright A-pillars and wheels placed at each corner of the car certainly make it more athletic-looking than many other mainstream mini hatches.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With our accelerated Qantas Transformation programme, we are already emerging as a leaner, more focused and more sustainable Qantas group,\" he said.\n\nQantas has laid off 2,500 employees to date - about half of the planned 5,000 redundancies. The group saw A$440 million in benefits from the transformation programme in FY14 and expects over A$600 million to be realised in FY15.\n\nMeanwhile, with greater flexibility on foreign investment after tweaks to the Qantas Sale Act, the group is setting up a new holding entity for Qantas International. This is expected to make it easier to attract foreign investment.\n\nHowever, as a result, the group had to write down its unit's fleet of aircraft in a non-cash charge totalling A$2.56 billion as the planes were bought when the Aussie dollar was significantly weaker than the greenback.\n\nOne bright spot, though, is that Qantas International's depreciation expenses will come down by A$200 million per year.\n\nFor the year under review, Qantas' domestic operations reported an underlying Ebit (earnings before interest and taxes) of A$30 million, plummeting from A$365 million in FY13 as it battles rival Virgin Australia for market share. Qantas International chalked up an underlying loss of A$497 million, more than doubling from a loss of A$246 million previously, hurt by high fuel costs and capacity injection by competitors in Asia and the Middle East.\n\nLast year, Qantas struck a seemingly unlikely alliance with erstwhile rival Emirates and subsequently shut down its long-standing Singapore hub in favour of Dubai. The move was meant to streamline its operations and deliver significant savings for its bleeding international business.\n\nQantas' Jetstar group chalked up losses of A$116 million, versus a profit of A$138 million a year earlier as its profitable Jetstar Australia business was offset by losses in Asia.\n\nJetstar Asia, which reported losses of A$40 million, has suspended growth amid a \"very challenging Singapore market\" where capacity grew 23 per cent in FY14, the group said. But Qantas expects Jetstar Asia's performance to pick up as capacity growth in the market eases, which is already occurring.\n\nAt the same time, the group is shelving plans to establish any new Jetstar ventures while it focuses on its transformation efforts. Mr Joyce said the group will realise \"the substantial value\" that exists across the Jetstar airlines over time. Reports last month suggested that Indonesia's Lion Air is on the prowl to scoop up Qantas' 49 per cent stake in Jetstar Asia.\n\nAside from Jetstar Asia, Qantas has JVs in Japan and Vietnam as well.\n\nIt has also been trying, with little success, to set up a budget carrier in Hong Kong and continues to await the green light from regulators.\n\nMeanwhile, Qantas' frequent flyer division - which it has decided not to sell - helped to bolster the bottom line by earning profits of A$286 million, up from A$260 million previously.\n\nQantas is extending its freeze on domestic capacity growth to the second quarter, which effectively means that it will add no domestic capacity in H1FY15.\n\nCAPA - Centre for Aviation said of Qantas' overseas network ahead of the results release: \"Reorientation of the network around strong regional hubs and premium partner airlines would provide Qantas with a firm footing to ensure profitability.\"\n\nThe group expects to swing into the black in H1FY15 with an underlying profit before tax.\n\nShares in Qantas surged nine Australian cents to close at A$1.385 on Thursday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Together with his bandmates Joe Kane (Paul McCartney), Clark Gilmour (John Lennon) and Grahame Critcher (Ringo Starr), they will be touring here for the first time next week in a show that will span The Fab Four's short but illustrious 10-year career.\n\nThe two-hour musical journey will cover some 30 songs; beginning from The Beatles' early days in Hamburg, all the way to their iconic final concert on the rooftop of Savile Row in London. \"The material we cover is very extensive,\" says McGown, who, like Harrison, is the youngest in the band. \"And everything you see is as authentic as possible, right down to the cufflinks, so the audience can feel what it must have been like.\"\n\nMcGown, who has been playing the guitar since he was 12 and now runs a music school, reveals that the secret to playing his character well comes from constantly studying Harrison. \"You have to always feel like you're not quite perfect and you want to get that wee percentage right; down to little things like how I move my eyebrows,\" he shares. \"The challenge is getting the balance - George is often thought to be the quiet guy but he's actually more than that and has got an attitude so I try to convey that the best I can.\"\n\nObsessing over their favourite band is no chore for Beatlemania because its members are all \"pretty much Beatles-nuts\". McGown says, \"We love playing their music so it all comes down to that... it's great to be able to play for people all over the world and to keep the music alive.\" Besides touring the UK constantly, Beatlemania has sold out shows in countries like Canada, Australia, Scandinavia, South Africa, Dubai, America and Hong Kong since 2009.\n\nOn-stage, the group not only has the grueling task of performing note-perfect renditions of classic Beatles hits but they also have to go through nine costume changes.. plus plenty of stuck-on facial hair. \"You'll see that we all start off clean-shaven at first but end up all hairy by the end of the night,\" laughs McGown.\n\nBeatlemania - On Tour comes to Mastercard Theatres at Marina Bay Sands on 5 and 6 September 2014 at 8pm.

They will not share the same perks, and they will also not share the same entrance.\n\nThe so-called poor door has brought an outcry, with numerous officials now demanding an end to the strategy. But the question of how to best incorporate affordable units into projects built for the rich has become more relevant than ever as Mayor Bill de Blasio seeks the construction of 80,000 new affordable units over the next 10 years.\n\nThe answer is not a simple one. As public housing becomes a crumbling relic of another era, American cities have grown more reliant on private industry to build housing for the poor and working class. Developers say they can maximise their revenues, and thus build more affordable units, by separating them from their luxury counterparts.\n\nEven advocates of affordable housing are divided on the issue; some argue that developers who segregate apartments should not benefit from government incentives, while others say the focus should be on building more homes, rather than where to enter them.\n\n\"There are trade-offs,\" said Lisa Sturtevant, vice-president for research at the National Housing Conference, an affordable housing advocacy group in Washington. \"It's really important that there's no discrimination, but there's a balance between what we can do and should do.\"\n\nAdministration officials attribute the two-door setup to changes to the zoning code in 2009 that Mr de Blasio voted for as a member of the City Council. He has said that the revisions, which allowed builders to put the affordable apartments in an attached segment of the building, were meant to increase housing units and that \"it was not evident at the time the nuances of where the doors would be\".\n\nDevelopers say the configuration of one building with an attached affordable segment works better when the market-rate units are for sale, as in the case of condos. If that is the choice, the developer is required to provide two separate entrances under the current rules of the programme.\n\nBut Alicia Glen, the deputy mayor for housing and economic development, said that separate front doors were not in keeping with the administration's principles of equality, and that the city was working to change the rules to prohibit them. \"Walking into a building should not be any different based on income status,\" Ms Glen said.\n\nFrom the street, the luxury condominium tower in the middle of the debate, at 40 Riverside Boulevard, and its six-floor affordable segment seem to blend seamlessly and appear as one structure. But the lower-income renters, who will pay US$850 a month for one-bedroom apartments and US$1,100 for two bedrooms, according to the developer, will go through a door facing 62nd Street while the condo owners will come in through a door facing the Hudson.\n\nNew York and other cities use a variety of tax breaks, subsidies and additional incentives to encourage developers to build affordable housing. In the case of 40 Riverside, the developer, Extell Development Co, is using a programme called inclusionary housing, which allows it to build more square feet than the zoning code would otherwise allow in exchange for a certain number of lower-rent apartments. Those additional square feet can be used at 40 Riverside, but Extell plans to transfer them to another project, which the law allows.\n\nThe affordable units do not have to be in the same location, as long as they are within the same community district or, if in another district, no farther than half a mile away.\n\nGary Barnett, who is Extell's founder and president, said that having the affordable apartments incorporated into the condominium tower would have meant \"giving away\" the most valuable units. \"We wouldn't be able to do affordable,\" he said. \"It wouldn't make any financial sense.\"\n\nNew York has always been an economically diverse city, with everyday people rubbing shoulders with millionaires and Bohemian artists on the streets. But the poor-doors image taps into the anxiety of many New Yorkers that the city is becoming liveable only for the wealthy.\n\nAt the Edge Community Apartments, the affordable housing building that abuts the Edge, a glass condo tower on the Brooklyn waterfront in Williamsburg, renters also have their own entrance, just a few doors from that of the condos. Only one entrance offers a doorman, concierge and valet, but some renters said what they resented was not being able to use some of the condo tower's amenities.\n\n\"We can't even use the pool or the gym,\" said one renter, a 34-year-old bank employee who wanted to remain anonymous for fear of jeopardising her one-bedroom rental. \"I've asked and offered to pay. It's kind of messed up.\"\n\nBut she and other tenants said they considered themselves lucky to have landed an apartment in the area, where everyone, rich or poor, steps out to views of the East River and Manhattan skyline and the cool energy of Williamsburg.\n\n\"Living here is a privilege,\" said Victoriano Oviedo, 59, a retiree who has a studio subsidised with a federal rental voucher. \"Over there you have powerful people. Over here you have low-income people. I'm fine with that.\"\n\nAside from square-footage bonuses, residential developments like 40 Riverside can take advantage of affordable housing tax breaks, which some advocates argue should not be available for projects that do not fully integrate the affordable units.\n\n\"If you do choose to live in segregated developments, don't use my tax dollars to support that,\" said Moses Gates, director of planning and community development for the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development.\n\nBut the repugnance is not universal. Among the roughly 500 cities with inclusionary zoning programmes, housing supporters have been mostly focused on having the affordable units built close to the their market-rate counterparts so that low-income households share some of the benefits of wealthier neighbourhoods, like good schools and public safety.\n\n\"It's so important to build as much affordable housing as possible and you always have to compromise,\" said Carol Lamberg, co-chairwoman of the New York Housing Conference, an affordable housing coalition. \"I just think the need is so great, you don't need a fancy lobby.\"\n\nThe controversy over separate entrances may pit Mr de Blasio's social justice values against his need for private development, but the inclusionary programme that caused it is voluntary and accounts for only a fraction of new affordable units that are built. Since 2005, city officials said, it has generated about 5,000 affordable units.\n\nAdministration officials are preparing to start a mandatory version of the programme, to force developers of large buildings to take the deal if they want to build at all, with its own rules about how to incorporate affordable units. The administration is seeking to eliminate the use of separate entrances in both the mandatory and voluntary programmes.\n\n\"Years ago, people would be upset and say 'that's politics', but now people feel more empowered to change this,\" said Linda Rosenthal, a state assemblywoman whose district includes 40 Riverside Boulevard.\n\n\"It's such a visual separation,\" Ms Rosenthal said. \"It gets at people when they see two separate doors.

All 200 first-run coloured vinyls and 80 cassette tapes of their latest album, Oscilla, have sold out in the week of its release - a rare and almost unheard of feat for a homegrown act that gets almost no airplay at all on the radio.\n\nOvernight success it is not. The band has paid its dues over the 12 years that they have been together; touring endlessly both here and overseas, consistently recording critically acclaimed works that help them build a bigger fanbase with each release, and enduring multiple line-up changes as members come and go.\n\nOscilla, their sixth studio album, finds The Observatory becoming a five piece after drummer, Bani Haykal, left the band earlier this year. He is replaced by new members Cheryl Ong and Yuen Chee Wai (synth, electronics). The rest of the band is made up of founding members Leslie Low (vocals, guitar), Dharma (guitar) and Vivian Wang (keyboards).\n\nThe Observatory takes the line-up changes in its stride though Low reveals it can be a challenge trying to find people who share the band's approach towards music. Self-doubt surfaces too when people leave. \"(We ask ourselves) did we do something wrong or were we being too ambitious?\" he explains. \"But when you step back and look at the bigger picture, it's never been easy to pursue a career in music to begin with - even among the core members, it's been an emotional roller-coaster ride so far.\"\n\nHence, the band clings onto \"perseverance and discipline... to keep it going until there's nothing left\", adds Low, who also has an upcoming solo album, No Such Things As Ghosts, coming out next month. It is almost a companion piece to Oscilla with the similar-looking cover artworks and the singer-songwriter penning the tunes in between recording with The Observatory.\n\nThe material is starkly different though. No Such Things As Ghosts is an acoustic album that sounds closer to Low's original group, the now-defunct neo-folk quartet, Humpback Oak. Oscilla, on the other hand, finds The Observatory at its most ambitious; venturing deep into progressive rock territory after experimenting with it on Dark Folke (2009) and Catacombs (2012).\n\nIt's for this reason Low feels the changing line-up actually helps the band to grow. \"It benefits the music since we always change things up from album to album,\" he says.\n\nWang adds new members, Ong and Yuen, have brought \"a certain rawness\" that has never been heard before. \"It's all of us reaching deep down into the core to feel and express without reservations - (something) quite hard to do, given that Singaporeans are generally reticent about overt expressiveness,\" she explains.\n\nThe limber but hard-hitting Ong, in particular, has injected primal energy into the The Observatory's sound; as evident from their recent live shows, in support of the album release. \"She's a trained Chinese percussionist, which we know is an unusual choice but hey, we've never quite done things the expected way,\" says Wang of her new band mate. \"Cheryl came on board shortly after Haykal's exit and had like a month and half to two months to get the entire album and its drum parts together... She's open-minded and is hungry to learn and get better - that's what being a working musician is about.\"\n\nLow adds that the new recruits gave new life to the band's material which had been left in limbo after Haykal's departure. \"There was a period when we were scratching our heads wondering what to do,\" he shares. \"This new burst of life with (Ong and Yuen) was essential to push the music towards its eventual refinement and release... it's been therapeutic to see the project finally come to fruition.\"\n\nOscilla is available to order in various physical and digital formats from theobservatory.com.sg. The Observatory plays an in-store gig on Saturday at Cat Socrates's Katong outlet at 3pm.

The challenge for companies is mitigating the risks fraud presents to an acceptable level but they can never banish it altogether,\" said Owen Hawkes, partner at KPMG in Singapore.\n\n\"What is needed is a concerted effort to understand the risks a given organisation faces, to put in place a holistic suite of measures to mitigate those risks, and education and training to ensure that the board, management and staff are all actively guarding the organisation against fraud,\" he added.\n\nThe recently released Singapore Fraud Survey 2014 by KPMG and Singapore Management University (SMU) found that the quantum of losses suffered by companies due to fraud has jumped more than three-fold to about $22 million now compared with just three years ago. The average cost of employee fraud is $457,000.\n\nThe survey also found that internal parties are involved in 75 per cent of the reported fraud, which is harder to detect and therefore very significant.\n\n\"Internal fraud is committed by what we call 'knowledgeable insider' who know the internal controls procedures and how to circumvent them,\" said Associate Professor Themin Suwardy of the Singapore Management University. \"The range of things they can commit is also much wider than the external fraudster,\" added Prof Suwardy, who is also Singapore divisional president at CPA Australia.\n\nSpecific to companies venturing abroad, two thirds of respondents felt that the risk of bribery and corruption was a key concern for Singapore companies conducting business in the region. Half of them were concerned about the need to provide payments or gifts in order to win or retain business compared with just 20 per cent in 2011 when a similar survey was conducted.\n\nMore than a third of respondents were also concerned about foreign government officials and overseas-based third parties, with more than four in 10 saying they were very concerned about interacting with foreign governments, while 36 per cent were very concerned about using third parties.\n\nExperts say companies will need to better manage this by assessing the risks inherent in the environment in which they are intending to operate by conducting due diligence and understanding the practices in the relevant country. \"Otherwise, they risk being blind-sided by practices they may never have known existed,\" said Mr Hawkes. Companies should also ensure that their employees, management, and even business partners understand the expectations of the organisation, he added.\n\nThe KPMG-SMU Fraud Survey also found that various approaches are being used by organisations to mitigate risks in cross-border activities. Three quarters said employees were issued guidelines for mitigating cross-border risks, two thirds have compliance programmes, while six in 10 had conducted training for their staff.\n\nAlthough these are good starting points, much more will have to be done to check on fraud when operating in foreign markets. \"With cross border activities, especially for the first time, the risks will be higher because you are dealing with more uncertainty. You have new people - staff, suppliers, customers and other parties - new regulations, perhaps different business practices and so forth, so it takes a while to set the culture and tone right,\" said Prof Suwardy.\n\nBoards, management and employees have a vital role in combating fraud. \"The board has to ensure that a framework is in place to prevent, detect and respond to fraud and exercise oversight to ensure that it is being operated effectively,\" said Mr Hawkes of KPMG. \"Management must dedicate sufficient time and resources to addressing fraud risks and engage with fraud issues at a sufficiently granular level when they arise.\"\n\nEmployees have a huge advantage in assisting their company in preventing and detecting fraud.\n\n\"Because they are on the ground, they can see how business activities are undertaken, what risks arise, and how controls are operated in reality. Employees can feed back information on threats, control failures, and unusual or anomalous activities providing they are trained and empowered to do so,\" added Mr Hawkes.\n\nObservers say fraud often occurs because of the lack of effective working controls.\n\n\"It is not enough to have control procedures in place but it is important to make sure they cover your risk areas and are carried out effectively,\" said Prof Suwardy. \"All company directors and managers need to have a healthy dose of professional scepticism. Of course, you need to trust your employees but please verify.\"\n\nWhen doing business abroad, companies need to undertake risk assessment procedures to understand and prepare for potential risks. They should carry out due diligence to understand who they are working with and who will be conducting business on their behalf.\n\nOne approach is to develop formal processes for identifying and assessing potential risks in new territories that a company intends to enter. These assessments typically include reviewing relevant business factors such as:\n\nThese processes should be refreshed periodically or during major changes to business operations. In addition, in-country personnel should be educated on such risks and on how to manage them.\n\nThe writer is general manager - Singapore, CPA Australia\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It stressed that the tragic losses of two aircraft in such a short space of time had exacerbated its financial problems and acknowledged that the airline's brand and business reputation had been severely damaged, accelerating the need to restructure the company.\n\nThe current quarter was its sixth straight quarter of losses. Although analysts had earlier projected that it would amount to some RM600 million, MAS' warning indicates that the full impact of the air disasters will likely be seen in the third quarter. Losses in the preceding quarter had been bigger at RM443 million, resulting in a first-half loss of RM750 million on a turnover of RM7.2 billion. In the first half of 2013, MAS had lost RM455 million.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The last three Savour events attracted about 50,000 people in total. Each event took place over three to five days and was designed to \"make fine dining accessible to a larger audience within a curated, purpose-built event,\" adds Mr Chen. Past venues like the F1 Pit Building were turned into carnival-like surroundings where people could mingle and sample dishes by chefs like Alain Passard of L'Arpege and Alvin Leung of BO Innovation from tented stands.\n\n\"Singapore's multicultural environment acts as a natural test-bed for our F&B brands. As these companies look to expand overseas, Hong Kong as a market presents interesting learning opportunities,\" says Lee Yee Fung, group director for Lifestyle Business at International Enterprise Singapore, which plays a large role in supporting local F&B brands.\n\nMr Chen emphasises that SAVOUR is not just a dining event, \"We have activities too, such as the studio kitchen, which allow guests to come in and cook with guidance from our participating chefs - something that you can't buy even if you had the money.\"\n\nOther activities included Celebrity Chefs masterclasses as well as food and wine workshops and tastings.\n\n\"It was always about making fine dining more accessible to the public - quality at a good price point, value for their money,\" Mr Chen explains. Dishes from SAVOUR Hong Kong will cost from HK$40 (S$6) to HK$80, while admission costs HK$150. However people with tickets to the Hong Kong Tennis Open will have free entry to the event.\n\nHe points out that the event also gives back by way of promoting awareness for the participating chefs and restaurants. \"People who come for the event may not even know about certain restaurants, chefs or dishes,\" Mr Chen says.\n\nMr Chen isn't about to stop at Hong Kong. \"We're planning to go to Manila and other countries in the region next year,\" he says. The endgame, he hopes, is to have SAVOUR festival \"replicate itself\". He adds, \"The vision is to have five or six shows in different locations every two months. This allows us to bring chefs from each country to different places, foster good relationships and bring awareness to local chefs as well.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The first is a fear that the impact of the recent consumption tax hike could prove to be more damaging and longer-lasting than expected; the second is the failure of Japanese exports to respond to the weaker yen as positively as hoped.\n\nBoth these concerns were voiced openly this week, when the Cabinet Office said in its monthly report - cautiously-worded - that \"the Japanese economy remains on a moderate recovery trend\" and is \"expected to recover\".\n\nThe report added, however, that if the adverse impact of the national consumption tax hike on April 1 continues for an extended period, it would become a risk factor for Japan's economic growth.\n\n\"Attention should be given to the downside risks to the Japanese economy, such as a lengthening of the reaction to the last-minute rise in demand and the slowing down of overseas economies,\" it said.\n\nThese concerns were underscored on Wednesday by Japan's vice-minister for economic and fiscal policy Yasutoshi Nishimura, who told Reuters in an interview that he was \"very concerned\" about the trend in private consumption in July and August, and that it seemed that the pullback in demand after the sales tax hike was being prolonged.\n\nHis comments were seen as being more sombre than those of the minister for economic and fiscal policy Akira Amari, who said on Tuesday that it was \"natural\" that the economy would shrink when the consumption tax rate was raised, and that it was important to monitor how the economy recovered afterwards.\n\nMr Nishimura said the government needed to be cautious about going ahead with a second-stage increase in the consumption tax (from 8 to 10 per cent) planned for next year.\n\nAnalysts have said that any delay by prime minister Shinzo Abe in implementing the second hike would only add to Japan's economic dilemma, given the government's highly strained fiscal position.\n\nMr Nishimura also said during his interview that he hoped the BOJ would decide on further monetary easing before long, but few economists expect it to do so before the end of this year at the earliest.\n\nFormer BOJ executive director Mikio Wakatsuki told The Business Times (BT) that the only thing likely to trigger further monetary stimulus would be if the weakening of the yen goes into reverse; this is because the strengthening of the currency would lower import prices and undermine the credibility of the BOJ's commitment to end deflation.\n\nThe Japanese central bank is likely to view further monetary easing now as having diminishing marginal returns, say economists.\n\nMeanwhile, the country's former vice-finance minister for economic affairs Eisuke Sakakibara has argued that a weaker yen resulting from further monetary easing could actually do more harm than good. He told BT: \"A weak yen used to be at least partially beneficial for the Japanese economy because it increased Japanese exports and reduced imports; but the recent weakening of the yen has not resulted in an increase in exports, and imports have not declined either because of rises in the prices of energy and food.\"\n\nMeawhile, minister Amari has said that fresh fiscal stimulus could be injected into the Japanese economy if the government decides to go ahead with a further hike in the national consumption tax from October 2015.\n\nMr Abe is expected to decide this October whether to proceed with the second tax hike, in which case further fiscal stimulus would be included in the fiscal year beginning April 1, 2015.\n\nJapan's Nikkei newspaper has speculated that this could amount to around 1 trillion yen.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Earnings from completed developments by joint ventures in Malaysia also contributed its fair share in the better results.\n\nRevenue jumped three-fold to S$492.89 million from S$168.56 million owing to units sold for Goodwood Residence in Singapore and Seasons Park in Tianjin China. The firm posted earnings per share of 16.55 Singapore cents for the quarter, significantly up from 2.82 Singapore cents a year ago.

It was the final event of the season for the Asian Tour where the field was restricted to the top 65 players on the the tour's \"order of merit\". He was happy to even make the cut, but to eventually win the Volvo Masters of Asia made 2008 his breakthrough year.\n\nBut he has had his share of ups and downs. Singapore is not an easy place to be a professional athlete, he says.\n\nGenerally, he thinks Singaporeans are not too supportive of athletes. The country, he says, has few domestic tours, a lack of corporate sponsors, as well as good coaches.\n\nHe wanted to give himself a chance to pursue golf professionally. So instead of matriculating to a local university, he attended the University of Arizona in the US. \"It was different,\" he says of the US. \"The sports culture there is so strong. A lot of people (in the US) want to be a professional athlete. It was really good getting exposed to that kind of culture, and I was lucky enough to play with some good players from the professional golf team (there).\"\n\nBack home, golf's future is not as pretty. \"I don't think it's trending the right way with the government taking back all the golf courses in the next few years,\" Lam says of golf's climate in Singapore. \"There is less access for the general public and I see it getting more challenging.\n\n\"While it's not impossible for a player to come out, I think it will be easier if he developed his game in America or Australia or even Thailand (there is a very good programme for young Thais there, they are very closed-knit and you can learn a lot from the top Thai players).\"\n\nLooking ahead, Lam wants to play on the European Tour or the US PGA Tour. \"That's where all the best players in the world play.\"\n\nQuincy Quek, 27\n\nTELEVISION and a junior golf set was what initially drew Singapore golfer Quincy Quek into the golfing arena. \"I think it was '96 or '97 when Tiger Woods came onto the scene and I was watching TV,\" he says. It also helped that back then, his father, who was more into tennis and squash, had a couple of close friends who tried to get him to start golf.\n\nOne even gave Quek a junior golf set to start out with. \"There wasn't something that really drew me towards golf,\" he says. \"When you first start the ball in the middle of the driving range, and then at night you watch professional golfers on TV . . . I think that's where the inspiration came in.\"\n\nHe joined the National Youth Team in 2001, and the National Team the following year. In 2009, he turned professional. Because there were not many local events in Singapore then, as opposed to neighbouring countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, he had to venture out to compete in South-east Asia.\n\nThat year, he took part in the Indonesia President Invitational, the Brunei Open and the Johnnie Walker Cambodian Open. The following year, he competed in the Asian Tour International, the King's Cup and once again at the Johnnie Walker Cambodian Open.\n\nBut in the middle of 2010, he injured his wrist. Everything you do in golf, you have to use your hands, says Quek. \"It's very hard to keep it immobile and allow it to recover. I was missing out on events and it was quite depressing.\"\n\nIt was a tough period for him as a professional. It was his livelihood, yet he could not do it. Besides golf, he was not sure what else he could do. But he recovered and went on to compete in thirteen tours in 2012, winning the Asian Development Tour in the Philippines, which really gave him the confidence for future events.\n\nIn retrospect, Quek benefited from that \"tough period\". \"That helped me appreciate the game and being out there, and made me more aware of my body and when it's my breaking point. I had been travelling quite a lot and it does take a lot out of your body.\"\n\nNow, he is more aware of that and tries to pace himself a bit better.\n\nFor a young person who is turning pro, Quek has the following advice: As a pro, you want to do well, but you also want to be consistent. \"Definitely have a plan - what events you want to play, how you are going to work towards those events. If you want to improve, you have to know what you are going to work on.\n\n\"As a professional, you don't have much time to plan, every week you go out there and try to earn as much money as you can. I think it will be better if you target events and try to work towards those and try to plan your schedule towards that.\"\n\nTo golfers in general, he advises never to give up. \"You are going to hit more bad shots than you do good shots. But I think the most important thing is that you're out there and you're enjoying the game. And you must always be patient, because you never know when the next break is going to come.\"\n\nSince he turned pro, every year Singapore is getting more events. According to Quek, there were at least tournaments every month for this and last year. \"I think it will only get better,\" he says. \"There are more junior golfers who actually aspire to turn professional. It also helps that there is more attention from the sponsors to develop junior players and create events.\"\n\nMardan Mamat, 46\n\nWINNING the Singapore Masters in 2006 changed his outlook in golf forever.\n\nWhen he was nine, he fell in love with the game watching people play golf on the course. At 10, he told himself he wanted to be a professional golfer. In 1994, he turned professional when he was 26. In 2004, he won the Indian Open, and the Philippines Open in 2012.\n\nBut his career highlight was winning the Singapore Masters in 2006. \"To win in front of the home crowd and my family, it was a good feeling. It's tough to win a tournament in your hometown. You need to perform and I did it.\"\n\nGolf's biggest challenge, he says, is that it is an individual game. \"It is yourself and the golf course . . . I am very fortunate to have people support me in the golf club. I have a few people who really backed me up until now, and because of that, I become what I am now.\"\n\nAt the moment, whenever he is free and not playing at a tour, he tries to spend time training some young students. He thinks Singapore has a lot of up and coming golf talent, and the Singapore Professional Golfers' Association (SPGA) should try to help these youngsters develop their game. \"I hope Singapore's golf will move on. I hope we can see youngsters coming up and making the country proud.\"\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/8e20cb6bda03c0d1d689ab64c53514d9af2975437a289e1815043d86760af1e3?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "On the greens: Quincy Quek (above) advises golfers in general to enjoy the game, and to always be patient; Lam Chih Bing laments Singapore's lack of support for athletes, corporate sponsors, as well as good coaches. - PHOTOS: ASIAN TOUR, LIU ZHUANG, MARK NEWCOMBE / WWW.VISIONSINGOLF.COM"}, {"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/f80562cbd1013e8ce6dc1f1f72db1b83a9a73df8fee426f2e742ede74acbe997?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "On the greens: Quincy Quek advises golfers in general to enjoy the game, and to always be patient; Lam Chih Bing (above) laments Singapore's lack of support for athletes, corporate sponsors, as well as good coaches."}, {"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/cbddcb82c8e6e8b25a8e33fe41ccd1ede0ce7104328136fc2b5cec7a60ee7752?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "'I hope Singapore's golf will move on.

Under the tie-up, Mapletree will buy and develop serviced apartments, and is licensed to use the Oakwood brand; in turn, Oakwood will source for acquisition and development deals for Mapletree in North America.\n\nMr Chua said Mapletree is targeting to triple, or at least double, the number of rooms in Asia managed by Oakwood Asia Pacific (OAP) from the current 3,000 rooms.\n\nOAP has so far inked 10 letters of intent (LOIs) for new management contracts this year; 15 other properties, for which it has secured management contracts, are being developed.\n\nMapletree is aiming to eventually build up a US$4 billion portfolio of serviced residences in gateway cities in Asia, the US and Europe, but it will focus its first efforts on \"lower hanging fruit\", said Mr Chua.\n\nThese include the US cities of Seattle, Chicago, Boston and Atlanta, where Oakwood is operating, as well as cities where Mapletree already has a presence, such as Tokyo and Osaka in Japan, and Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Chongqing in China.\n\nMr Chua said that Mapletree may incorporate serviced apartments into some of the mixed-use sites that it already owns in China. \"We are also considering bidding for sites that are for serviced residential use.\"\n\nOakwood may manage the serviced component of Mapletree's mixed project in Vietnam called Saigon South Place, which is now in design-feasibility stage.\n\nMr Chua said that having the new asset class will strengthen Mapletree's ability to tender for mixed-use projects that include a hospitality component.\n\nIn Singapore, Mapletree is still on the lookout for assets to acquire and develop under Oakwood brand of serviced residences, he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Both these acquisitions, said the firm, will transform Hal-cyon to become a top five rubber producer globally.\n\n\"At this juncture, management views it as prudent to fortify the working capital resources in anticipation of a recovery in rubber prices and further growth in produced and distributed volumes,\" said Halcyon, adding that the proceeds from the placement are not required to fund the acquisitions of Anson or NCE.\n\nThe firm's issued and paid up share capital will increase to 421,000 shares once the placement, which will give Mr Goi a 5.94 per cent stake in the enlarged firm, is complete.\n\nAs a result of the enlarged share base, Lynette Le Mercier, who currently owns 15.53 per cent in Halcyon, will cease to be a controlling shareholding as per Catalist rules. Her interest will be cut down to 14.61 per cent post-placement, with her still remaining as the single largest shareholder.\n\nHalcyon also said it may consider a proposed transfer to the mainboard sometime early next year, which will position the firm appropriately and better allow it to attract institutional investors and reach out to a wider investor base.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in March this year, political tensions in Thailand and the spate of kidnappings in Sabah have also affected tourism demand. Chinese tourists typically travel to Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand as part of a multi-destination tour.\n\nSome 1.53 million visitors from Indonesia - Singapore's top visitor generating market - came here in the first six months of the year, up 3 per cent year on year. China is the second biggest source market for Singapore, with 871,000 travellers coming here in H1 2014, down 30 per cent.\n\nThe STB report also highlighted that the decline in Chinese visitor arrivals came largely from the segment of Chinese travellers that came to stay one day or less. The number of Chinese visitors that stayed for a day or less fell 52 per cent to 401,000, although those staying two days or more rose by 21 per cent to 406,000 in H1 2014. This lifted the average length of stay by Chinese visitors from 2.7 days in H1 2013 to 4.2 days in H1 2014.\n\nOther countries which account for Singapore's top five visitor generating markets - namely Malaysia (-2 per cent), Australia (-3 per cent) and India (-1 per cent) - reported slight decreases as well.\n\nMeanwhile, markets which saw double digit increases in tourists in Singapore in H1 2014 include Hong Kong (16 per cent), South Korea (16 per cent) and Vietnam (12 per cent).\n\n\"Unless we see a significant turnaround in Chinese tourists in H2 2014, we estimate overall visitor arrivals for the full year to fall by 2.5-3.5 per cent to 15-15.2 million visitors, the first time since the 2008 global financial crisis that Singapore experienced a decline in tourist arrivals,\" said CIMB economist Song Seng Wun.\n\nThe STB has forecast visitor arrivals to clock 16.3-16.8 million this year, and tourism receipts to hit S$23.8-24.6 billion. Last year, Singapore welcomed 15.5 million tourists, who spent S$23.5 billion.\n\n\"As we move forward into the second half of 2014, we are hopeful that we will continue to see an increase in quality visitors - bringing with them not only a recovery in visitor arrivals, but also an increased tourism expenditure,\" said Anita Tan, chief operating officer of the National Association of Travel Agents Singapore (Natas).\n\nMs Tan said that Natas members have been working together with industry stakeholders and partners to reach out to overseas markets and attract tourists via roadshows and other activities. For instance, in November, Natas and airport operator Changi Airport Group (CAG) are organising a Singapore Pavilion at the China International Travel Mart 2014 in Shanghai, where a delegation of travel agents and other travel organisations will participate. Meanwhile, gazetted hotel room revenue increased 8.8 per cent to S$1.55 billion for the six months spanning January to June. The average room rate inched up 1.2 per cent to about S$258, while the average occupancy rate slipped 1.2 per cent to nearly 85 per cent. Revenue per available room was more or less flat at S$218.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": [{"image_url": null, "alt_text": null}]}

SGX also does not allow listings of mineral firms with resources that have not been certified according to the Australasian Joint Ores Resource Committee (JORC), Mr Poh added.\n\nThe offer will close on Sept 15, with the counter expected to be listed on ASX on Sept 24.\n\nBesides Tian Poh, Poh Group has invested in a gold mine concession in Cambodia as well. The group also has activities in engineering - including a joint venture Wengfu International that is formed with major Chinese state-owned phosphate firm Wengfu Group; aquaculture in China; power generation in Mongolia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Cambodia; residential and industrial property development in Singapore; and IT product distribution in Bhutan.\n\nIn September last year, SGX introduced new mainboard rules for mineral, oil and gas (MOG) listings in an effort to woo more of such firms. There are currently 22 MOG firms listed on SGX with a market value of about S$5.5 billion.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The company plans to expand in prime locations such as Causeway Bay and Tsim Sha Tsui, where it expects growth in jewellery sales, while closing stores elsewhere, he said last Thursday.\n\n\"Usually when we renew leases for stores which we rented three years ago, we would see a big jump in rent,\" said Mr Wong. \"But we've seen the rental increase slow at many stores. Some landlords didn't even ask for more rent.\"\n\nLuxury retailers in Hong Kong have seen sales drop by at least 25 per cent for each month in the second quarter as Chinese tourists spent less on watches and jewellery. Luk Fook is adjusting its mix of stores as slowing economic growth in China and a corruption crackdown in the mainland crimp spending.\n\nA store under renovation in the Tsim Sha Tsui district, popular with Chinese tourists, will be bigger when it re-opens before the Christmas holidays, Mr Wong said. The company has opened new shops in Causeway Bay, Mong Kok and Tsuen Wan this year.\n\nThe number of shops Luk Fook operates in Hong Kong will be unchanged from a year ago as it shutters stores elsewhere, he said. The company had 44 shops in the city at the end of June, it said in a July statement.\n\nSpending by tourists \"dropped significantly\" in the second quarter, Hong Kong Financial Secretary John Tsang said on Aug 10, leading the government to cut its economic growth forecast for the year.\n\nHong Kong is seeing more tourists from smaller Chinese cities with less purchasing power, executive director Nancy Wong Lan Sze said at the same interview.\n\nThe average price of products sold declined to HK$7,700 (S$1,240) for the year ended March, from HK$8,700 a year ago, according to a company presentation in June.\n\nProtests against Chinese tourists and over the election of Hong Kong's next chief executive also impacted Luk Fook's sales, Mr Wong said.\n\n\"We hope these conflicts can be peacefully solved, so that our business won't be ruined,\" he said.\n\nPrime street retail rents in Hong Kong were about US$4,334 per square foot annually as of the end of last year, 31 per cent higher than in New York and more than double that in Paris, according to a February report from CBRE Group Inc. Rents in secondary locations are expected to fall as much as 15 per cent from a year ago as retailers stay cautious, the realtor said in a second-quarter review report. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Property\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM", "images": []}

The company's \"Upper Class\" swapped luxury for a technology-led, business-friendly approach. It includes in-seat power as well as pre-flight innovations such as a Club House lounge with free haircuts and a putting green.\n\n\"If we can address the passenger's core needs in an imaginative way the tag becomes less important,\" Virgin brand and customer engagement director Reuben Arnold said. \"It's business class with many of the benefits of first.\"\n\nAustralia's Qantas Airways Ltd led the way in paring its first-class offering in 2010 following the credit crunch and global recession, with CEO Alan Joyce saying at the time that the product was in \"long-term decline\". The luxury berths were retained only on 12 Airbus Group NV A380 superjumbos and three Boeing Co 747s operating premium routes such as Sydney-London.\n\nFollowing an Aug 20 announcement, Fort Worth, Texas-based American Airlines will drop first-class cabins from 47 Boeing 777-200s, limiting the top-end offering to its biggest 777-300ER jets, of which there are only 14 in the fleet, plus a handful of Airbus A321T narrow-bodies used on California-New York routes.\n\nWhile first-class berths offer a more exclusive travel experience, the perks that come with a fare double the business tariff can be marginal, often including finer dining, high-end toiletries, a fancier limousine to the airport and free pyjamas.\n\nIn Europe, where first class has traditionally been a mainstay of long-haul services, Lufthansa is removing the product from 31 planes. An upgrade of those jets keeping the seats will be completed next year, with the retention of an open-plan layout favoured over a switch to individual booths.\n\nTicket sales have gained more than 10 per cent with the move, which has focused on routes such as Frankfurt-Los Angeles to maximise occupancy by paying clients rather than those using air miles to upgrade. After the refit, first will still be available in about 70 per cent of wide-bodies, versus more than 90 per cent previously.\n\nAir France, by contrast, offers luxury berths in only 40 per cent of its 100 or so wide-body planes, complemented by an onward private-jet service from the carrier's Paris-Charles de Gaulle hub to other airports across the continent.\n\n\"There's not a market for first class on every route, it only works for certain destinations,\" Air France-KLM chief executive officer Alexandre de Juniac said.\n\nThe European carrier with the biggest proportion of first-class seats is British Airways, which offers about 1,200 spread across 80 per cent of its long-haul planes.

Each rig will take at least two years to build and all of the five rigs are expected to be completed in about six years.\n\n\"SBI Offshore has entered a new phase of growth. The recently concluded design and engineering contract serves as a catalyst for the group to secure larger onshore and offshore oil and gas projects.\n\n\"We are hopeful of a successful outcome in our negotiations for the rigs and intend to secure more of such higher-value projects in the future,\" said Chan Lai Thong, executive chairman of SBI.\n\nSBI shares closed 4 cents higher on Wednesday at 24 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Driven by a strong Singapore dollar (SGD) and high yields, the value of issuances in the first three weeks of this month is almost three times that for the whole of August last year.\n\nCorporates too are reaping the benefits, with more of those in the mid-tier credit category able to price their debt lower with each successive issue as well as increase the tenure.\n\nFor this month up to Aug 25, there were nine deals worth S$1.75 billion versus seven valued at S$650 million for August 2013. For the year up to Aug 25, there were 102 issues worth S$16.65 billion, against 96 valued at S$12.42 billion same time last year, according to Bloomberg. Total 2013 bond issuances amounted to S$19.84 billion.\n\nThe strong demand for bonds meant last week's CapitaLand Treasury S$500 million 10-year deal - despite it being the largest corporate single tranche issue this year, was sold at a cheap 3.8 per cent for the issuer. The initial guidance price was 4 per cent.\n\n\"It was the largest ever SGD senior bond issuance at lowest interest coupon for CapitaLand and largest SGD issuance from a real estate issuer in recent years,\" said Clifford Lee, DBS Bank head of fixed income.\n\nIt was the first SGD senior bond issuance for CapitaLand since 2010 and the first bond issuance since 2012, highlighting the scarcity value of CapitaLand paper, he said.\n\nThe deal, which attracted orders in excess of S$2 billion, saw 59 per cent from financial managers, institutions and banks and 33 per cent from private banking accounts.\n\nMr Lee said fund managers are back in the market as they now expect interest rates to rise gradually, a U-turn from last year's view when bond prices tumbled due to expectations of a hike in rates.\n\n\"The market has stabilised - the professional investors are coming in to invest with less fear of being caught off guard with choppy interest rate environment,\" he said.\n\nBut private bank investors, who have formed the bulk of this year's bond investors, have no such fear. And they appear to have been richly rewarded for their conviction.\n\nThe Markit iBoxx SGD corporate total return index which has been rising pretty much non-stop since the beginning of the year was at another high of 109.84 on Tuesday, up 4.6 per cent.\n\nMany deals this year have come from mid-cap stocks which offer yields of between 4 and 8 plus per cent, rich offerings when seen against the sub-one per cent of bank deposits.\n\nWith practically every deal oversubscribed, some of the more risky issuers have been able to price their bonds progressively lower while stretching the maturity.\n\nUpstream oil and gas KrisEnergy last week sold four-year S$200 million bonds at 5.75 per cent; in June it priced a three-year S$130 million deal at 6.25 per cent.\n\n\"The mid-caps ... are serving the yield needs and shorter duration demands of investors,\" said Mr Lee.\n\n\"The success of the SGD bond market this year has been a result of two factors - currency stability and the multi-year maturity of the SGD markets which has resulted in a deepening of the breadth and depth of both issuers and buyers,\" said Todd Schubert, Bank of Singapore head of fixed income research.\n\nThe SGD has risen 1.5 per cent against the US unit this year.\n\n\"We think that the second factor is an on-going process that will continue to gather momentum,\" he said.\n\nChung Shaw Bee, Standard Chartered regional head of wealth management, Asean, said the strong demand for SGD bonds came from customers whose natural currency was SGD.\n\n\"These are customers who earn income in SGD or who have obligations in SGD, such as business expenses, housing, education etc. As a result of the affinity towards the SGD, these customers are always seeking yield in SGD terms and fixed income instruments are a natural consideration,\" she said.\n\nAre investors taking too much bond risks?\n\n\"Higher risk investments would typically generate higher returns,\" said Jason Khoo, HSBC head of debt capital markets, South-east Asia. \"There is currently a sufficiently liquid SGD bonds secondary market for investors to benchmark new issue pricing when they consider an offering.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It also plans to seek exit from the Singapore Exchange watch-list.\n\nThe earnings for the 12 months ended June 30 came on the back of a 14.5 per cent increase in revenue to S$40.3 million, its highest in five years.\n\nThe fourth-quarter contributed a net profit of S$801,000, with revenue climbing 12 per cent to S$13.2 million. In the year-ago corresponding quarter, it had a net loss of S$2.3 million.\n\nThe Q4 results not only marked its third consecutive quarter of profit but also reflected its strongest quarterly net profit performance since 2008, propelled by luxury boat sales in North America and growth in Asia.\n\nAt the pre-tax level, full-year profit was S$1.04 million, against a loss of S$5 million the year before.\n\nThe group did not just work on its top-line during this period but also made strides in controlling its bottom line. For FY2014, its annual operating expenses fell 31.5 per cent to S$6.5 million - its lowest in five years due in part to a restructuring of its offices in the US and Australia.\n\nIts efforts to increase productivity and utilisation of the group's yard in Pasir Gudang also saw its gross profit margin increase to 19.4 per cent for the year from 13.6 per cent.\n\nThe group's improvement in its financial performance saw its earnings per share for the full-year increase to 0.66 Singapore cent from the loss of 4.64 Singapore cents last year despite an increase in the number of shares from the rights issue in October 2013.\n\nGrand Banks, which has been on the SGX watch-list since 2011 for three consecutive years of losses, said on Wednesday that in view of its financial performance this year, it intends to submit an application to the SGX to be removed from this troubled list after its financial results have been audited.\n\nGrand Banks shares last closed at 26.5 Singapore cents on Tuesday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It was not that the old woman did not want a free apartment. She wanted two. Yet the law permits developers to give only one.\n\nSo Mr Varma paid her a visit. The woman lived with her two sons, and the sons' wives, in a 90-square-foot shack. The wives argued. Constantly.

Optimism that central banks will support economic growth sent the MSCI All-Country World Index up 3.8 per cent from its low this month. The S&P 500 has risen for 10 of the last 13 days and the Nasdaq Composite Index is about 10 per cent from an all-time high.\n\nGlobal markets are surmounting crises in Ukraine, the Gaza Strip and Iraq as investors renew bets that stimulus will revive growth. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index posted its biggest two-day gain since April after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi signalled policymakers may consider introducing an asset-buying plan. Japan's Topix index is near its highest level since January, rebounding from losses earlier this year.\n\n\"Geopolitical events are significant and major new attacks are tragic, but they're not enough to unsettle the global economic forces in play, especially in America,\" said Patrick Spencer, head of US equity sales at Robert W Baird & Co in London. \"Draghi gave clear indication that he's standing ready with further measures to stimulate growth and that's helping overall sentiment.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 has climbed 0.6 per cent over the previous two days, closing at 2,000.02 on Tuesday, after data added to signs the economy is strengthening. US durable-goods orders jumped by the most on record last month and consumer confidence climbed in August to the highest level in almost seven years.\n\nStocks from Brazil and Saudi Arabia have seen some of the world's biggest gains in the past month. The Ibovespa is up 7.2 per cent this month, led by a rally in state-run companies on speculation President Dilma Rousseff will lose her re-election bid. The Tadawul All Share Index is also up about 7 per cent in August as the kingdom prepares to grant foreign investors access to one of the world's most restricted markets.\n\nThe value of equities globally has soared from US$25 trillion in March 2009. Stocks were valued at US$63 trillion at the 2007 peak, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThree rounds of Fed stimulus and record corporate earnings have helped the S&P 500 almost triple from its March 2009 low. At last week's economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Fed chair Janet Yellen said the labour market has yet to fully recover from the worst recession since the Great Depression.\n\nMinutes from the US central bank's July meeting indicated that the Fed is committed to supporting the recovery, even as some policymakers signal a willingness to raise key rates sooner than anticipated. The Fed is on pace to wind down stimulatory bond purchases in October.\n\n\"Yes, we are beginning to move away from unconventional policy, QE, towards conventional policy, rates moves,\" Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life Investments Ltd., which oversees about US$317 billion, said by phone from Edinburgh. \"But the only reason central banks are doing this is because they believe growth is sufficiently strong.\"\n\nMr Draghi's comments at the Jackson Hole conference reinforced speculation that the ECB will start quantitative easing even after cutting interest rates to record lows in June and lining up more cheap loans for banks. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told reporters he will keep policy accommodative until price stability is achieved.\n\nBut Oliver Wallin, the investment director at Octopus Investments Ltd in London, said the recent stock gains are making him cautious.\n\n\"There's a sense that markets are a little complacent,\" he said by phone. \"There's quite a lot going on in the background that warrant a bit more concern, yet equity markets seem to be unfazed. Equities will continue to be the best asset, but we have recently moved from a liquidity-driven market into a fundamental-driven one. As a result, you need to be more selective, looking for the markets with the strongest fundamentals,\" said Guillaume Duchesne, an equity strategist at BGL BNP Paribas in Luxembourg. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

Core inflation rose 2.2 per cent year-on-year in July - an elevated but still manageable number on the whole. Headline inflation, which includes transport and housing, at 1.2 per cent was lower than market expectations. But not everyone experienced such benign inflation. The reason is that the consumer price index (CPI), on which we base our national inflation estimates, is simply our best guess at how much a typical household's typical consumption would typically cost. Of course, most people are not typical. Different households with different income levels consume different quantities and different types of goods and services.\n\nAccording to the latest official data on CPI based on income groups, the poorest-earning 20 per cent of households allocate more of their total expenditure to food than the rest of the country. To be exact, a household with income falling within the bottom 20 per cent spends about S$27 out of every S$100 spent on food, compared to S$24 out of S$100 for the middle 60 per cent of earners and just S$18 per S$100 for the top 20 per cent of earners. Health care is another area where the lowest income earners spend proportionately more - over S$7 per S$100 for the bottom 20 per cent versus less than S$6 per S$100 for the middle 60 per cent and the top 20 per cent.\n\nThe bad news for the lowest-income households was that food and healthcare prices were two of the three most inflated CPI components in July as well as year-on-year over the January-to-July period. That means inflation in those areas hit the poorest segment of the population more than the wealthiest. Costlier necessities was not the only thing that went against the lowest-income segment. Education prices have also been one of the fastest climbers in the CPI. The problem with education prices rising so quickly is that it limits the upward mobility of the poorest and threatens the meritocracy model to which Singapore subscribes. Transportation prices also fell year-on-year in July, and was the slowest inflating component of the CPI over the year-on-year January to July period. But with subdued car prices and certificates of entitlement the main cause for the drop, it was the wealthier households that benefited the most from the modest inflation in transportation.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Placing her under formal investigation signals that prosecutors believe they have evidence of wrongdoing, but the charge of negligence hardly suggests high crimes.\n\nNegligence by a government official that makes possible the misappropriation or embezzlement of public funds is punishable with a maximum fine of 15,000 euros (S$24,691) and up to one year in prison.\n\n\"After three years of investigation and dozens of hours of interrogation, the committee concluded that I had not been guilty of any infraction,\" Ms Lagarde said in the statement, \"so it was reduced to claiming that I had been insufficiently vigilant during the arbitration.\"\n\nIn the French legal system, a formal investigation suggests prosecutors believe they have enough of a case that they may ultimately bring criminal charges and have a trial. The reality is that many such investigations drag on for years with no charges being filed before being dropped.\n\nSince its creation in 1944, the top IMF official has been a European, with the job alternating among Western European nations. Ms Lagarde took over as managing director of the IMF in 2011 after her French predecessor, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, left in disgrace amid charges - later dropped - that he had sexually assaulted a woman in a New York hotel room.\n\nMs Lagarde had served as Mr Sarkozy's finance minister from 2007 until leaving for the IMF.\n\nMr Tapie, who had been in a long dispute with a state-owned bank, Credit Lyonnais, walked away from the arbitration with more than 400 million euros.\n\nA career Socialist, Mr Tapie in 2007 suddenly backed Mr Sarkozy's centre-right Union for a Popular Movement party. The amount of the award came as a shock to many, and the investigation began after critics accused Mr Sarkozy's government of having carried out a sham arbitration.\n\nSt\u00e9phane Richard, Ms Lagarde's former chief of staff and currently the chief executive of Orange, the French telecommunications giant, has already been placed under formal investigation on \"suspicion of organised fraud\".\n\nProsecutors in Paris could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nIn a statement, the IMF's communications director, Gerry Rice, said Ms Lagarde was \"on her way back to Washington and will, of course, brief the board as soon as possible. Until then, we have no further comment.\"\n\nMs Lagarde's lawyer did not immediately return a request for comment, but Ms Lagarde told Agence France-Presse that she had no intention of stepping down from her post at the IMF. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up", "images": []}

Projects in the region may drive sales in five to six years to S$100 million from S$21 million in 2013, he said.\n\nStarburst is Singapore's best-performing stock since it listed its shares on July 10, soaring 145 per cent. The benchmark Straits Times Index added 1.7 per cent in that span.\n\n\"After the Arab Spring, countries in the Middle East are starting the implementation of compulsory military services,\" Mr Lim said in an interview on Aug 21. \"They need to build new shooting ranges to accommodate the increase in the military personnel.\"\n\nNo region has seen a faster increase in defence spending than the Middle East, with Saudi Arabia boosting its military and security budget 21 per cent to US$81 billion in 2014 from a year earlier, according to IHS Jane's. Revolts from late 2010 to 2012 driven by the world's highest youth unemployment rate toppled leaders including Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, Libya's Muammar Gaddafi and Tunisia's Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.\n\nThe UAE is mandating military service for men aged 18-30, with participation optional for women, according to the state-run news agency. Starburst is also seeking a contract with Qatar, which is beefing up security as it prepares to host the 2022 World Cup soccer tournament. The stock climbed 2.7 per cent to a record high of 76 Singapore cents at Monday's close, capping a 19 per cent three-day advance.\n\n\"Starburst has a very interesting story,\" Ryan Huang, a strategist at IG Ltd in Singapore, said. \"They've got their spotlight in the Middle East and there's a lot of optimism there. They're in a very niche market, with high barriers to entry. They also have high profit margins.\"\n\nContributions from the region will account for 50 per cent of revenue in the next few years from 31 per cent last year, Mr Lim said.\n\nStarburst, which has built almost 20 shooting ranges in South-east Asia and the Middle East in the past 15 years, plans to use the net S$13.5 million raised from its IPO to double the size of its fabrication facility in Singapore.\n\nStarburst's net income is likely to almost double to S$16.1 million this year and climb to S$28.4 million in 2015, supported by its strong orderbook, Kenneth Ng and Justin Chiam at CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, wrote in a note dated Aug 20.\n\nThe company may also extend gains as the shares are trading at a discount to its global peers, the analysts said.

The system's seamless online integration will help to eliminate manual data entry error and result in more efficient transfer of information along the entire supply chain.\n\n\"It is an example of how logistics companies can come together to jointly develop horizontal platforms that boost collective productivity,\" Mr Lee added.\n\nHe pointed out that the logistics industry is no longer the traditional sector it used to be and has seen a lot of innovation in recent times, which is necessary to help the industry in Singapore maintain its competitive edge.\n\n\"It is now an industry characterised by frequent investments in IT systems and solutions, increased R&D spending and a highly skilled workforce. It is therefore better called a 'logistics innovation' industry, to highlight the many innovations that are being undertaken at both the firm and industry level. And it is through continuing to update and innovate that Singapore can maintain its lead as a global logistics hub.\"\n\nThe logistics sector here is set to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 6.2 per cent, to reach over US$40 billion in 2016, Mr Lee revealed. This is because Singapore has become the choice location for leading manufacturers in industries such as semiconductors, electronics and chemicals, making it a key node in global supply chains. In addition, the sector is set to expand due to the broad growth in trade and other services, particularly the growth of e-commerce in the region.\n\n\"Retail online sales are expected to make up over 40 per cent of total global retail sales by 2016, and this will require sophisticated logistics solutions,\" Mr Lee highlighted. \"This year alone, B2C e-commerce transactions in Asia Pacific are expected to reach over US$525 billion, making it the largest regional e-commerce market.\"\n\nThe CMS is powered by Containerchain Solutions, managed and developed by CDAS Logistics Alliance, with support from Spring Singapore.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Nominal economic growth is subdued (but rising) and monetary stimulus still plentiful. What are the implications of the first post-crisis divergence in central bank strategy? And what does life after zero (rates) look like?\n\nValuations are becoming stretched across markets and investor complacency is high. Many asset owners hold similar investment views: long credit, long momentum and short emerging market risk. This sets markets up for more volatility - especially as the focus shifts from the end of US quantitative easing (QE) to worries about the timing and magnitude of US interest rate hikes. Easy monetary policies by central banks have pushed down bond yields, encouraging risk taking and inflating asset valuations. Volatility is suppressed in equities, bonds and currencies. Government bonds look particularly dear and credit markets are moving in the same direction. Dispersion in the credit markets is unusually low, with a rising tide lifting all bonds. These markets have essentially become rate, not credit, plays.\n\nRelaxed financial conditions are pushing asset owners into look-alike yield-seeking trades. The longer monetary policy smothers volatility and underwrites heady valuations, the bigger the eventual recoil. Geopolitical risks bubbling to the surface add to the potential for volatility spikes. The market response to political crises is often nasty, brutish and short.\n\nMany investors braced for rising rates and volatility as the US Federal Reserve reduced its monthly bond buying. Why did the opposite happen? Markets have overemphasised the impact of QE - and underclubbed the importance of zero-interest rate policy (ZIRP).\n\nQE-created liquidity leaked beyond US borders. This is why the Fed's signalling the end of bond buying was such a big deal in emerging markets. ZIRP is likely to stick around for a while if we take Fed chair Janet Yellen at her word. The anticipation of a ZIRP reversal could cause market angst on the timing and magnitude of future rate hikes which brings a greater chance of spikes in volatility. Cycles of low US volatility (both interest rate as well as realised and implied equities volatility) have tended to last until higher rates started to inhibit growth. Volatility and credit cycles have gone hand-in-hand, ending simultaneously when growth jitters led to a rise in expected defaults. The trick will be to navigate the impact of increasing divergence between the tighteners (Bank of England and the Fed) and looseners (Bank of Japan and European Central Bank).\n\nWe generally prefer equities over bonds, as equity valuations look more reasonable compared to bond yields, particularly outside the US. However, the longer the base-case scenario - Low for Longer - lasts, the more stretched valuations become as risk taking is rewarded. Equity markets are at risk of becoming disconnected from earnings growth. Multiple expansion (investors paying a higher price for the same level of earnings) drove gains in all major markets last year with the exception of Japan.\n\nThis factor has been behind gains in emerging markets, the eurozone and the UK this year, even as earnings shrunk in the latter two. Japanese and US equity returns have been underpinned by earnings growth, by contrast. Rising earnings may not translate into positive returns in the short term, but they are usually rewarded in the long run.\n\nEquities are not cheap, but we do not believe we are in a bubble-yet. In the meantime, brace for shifts in internal market dynamics, such as the equity momentum reversal this spring. One complication is that market liquidity has lagged the pace of debt issuance. Prices could gap down in case of a wave of reallocations out of areas such as corporate bonds. Ravenous appetite for yield by long-term asset owners is a stabiliser.\n\nAsset owners need to take more risk just to keep standing still. Low yields underpin equity valuations. Takeovers, corporate issuance and share buybacks have been booming. Debt holders essentially are subsidising return-on-equity growth. The problem is that it makes equities as vulnerable as bonds to rising rates. It also means bond and equity correlations could rise, making diversification harder.\n\nUS growth looks set to improve thanks to pent-up demand for housing, a fading fiscal drag and capex edging up. However, the risk is that the Fed may stay \"low for too long\", which could result in market-induced rises in rates and volatility. The ECB's resolve to prevent the eurozone from falling into a deflationary spiral is likely good news for European risk assets. Watch current account balances to gauge competitiveness and the ECB's manoeuvring room to start an asset purchase programme.\n\nJapanese equities have underperformed so far this year, yet we remain believers (in the hedged variety). Our reasoning includes an \"all-in\" BoJ flooding the market with liquidity, cheap valuations, structural reform efforts, and an asset allocation shift towards fewer bonds, more equities at the US$1.2 trillion Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF).\n\nChina's GDP growth expectations have come down but could probably edge even lower. The country's investment-fuelled growth is not sustainable in our view. Reform is the only way out - but it may dampen growth in the short term. The success depends on China's export machine, which makes up a quarter of GDP. If exports hold up, the government has more manoeuvring room. Any downside surprises to export growth could cause the government to stall or even dial back reforms.\n\nAngst about a credit blow-out looks overdone. Absolute leverage is daunting but containable. We do worry about the torrid growth in credit, especially in the \"shadow banking\" system of securitised corporate loans. There are good arguments to bank on a belief that China's leadership has the ammunition and determination to prevent any systemic financial market crisis.\n\nThe biggest change over the first half of 2014 has been that the brewing crisis in emerging markets has since stabilised. Emerging market growth and markets have been weak in recent years, setting the stage for a cyclical rebound over the next year. The currencies of the \"Fragile Five\" (Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey) declined sharply as the market punished countries with large external deficits. There are signs this bitter medicine may be making them more competitive again. Current account balances are forecast to recover. Divergence among emerging market countries is our main theme, and we favour countries with strong balance sheets that are implementing reforms to make their economies more competitive, such as Mexico.\n\nThe writer is the chief investment strategist at BlackRock Investment Institute.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It includes services such as payables, receivables, payroll and liquidity management.\n\nUOB, the second largest Singapore bank by market capitalisation, has a global network of more than 500 offices in 19 countries and territories in Asia Pacific, Western Europe and North America.\n\nThe bank has increased the number of staff to service the cross-border cash and trade needs of its clients. Today, the total headcount for the transaction banking unit is 250, with new hires in Singapore, Hong Kong and New York this year.\n\nUOB has also invested in developing an enhanced integrated electronic system for cash management, trade finance and supply chain services. The online system, called business Internet banking plus (BIBPlus), provides companies with an end-to-end view of their cashflow and trade positions. This allows businesses to have better control and management of their working capital as they expand across the region.\n\nClients are recognising UOB's services. According to an AsiaMoney poll, UOB has won the 2014 best local cash management bank award in all the three corporate segments - small, mid and large-sized companies.

This move was just the latest by a growing wave of countries and airlines that appear to want to stave off the Ebola threat by stopping travel in and out of places confronting the virus.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/aed5e59c81b2ee34ebc3c13c145374c9ae3a77785ef6facfd1fca326e2bc16b4?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Dr Nabarro: Has stressed the importance of maintaining regular air routes and normal borders"}]}

This will be piloted from 2016.\n\nThose on board would join a company as a salaried employee, with the potential to earn more after they complete the programme if they performed well and took on larger job scopes.\n\nThey would also receive employer-recognised skills certification, said the Education Ministry in a statement.\n\nThe announcement came after the Aspire committee recommended that polytechnic and ITE graduates be matched to companies that are committed to supporting on-the-job training and further skills upgrading.\n\nThese graduates would get the chance to gain work experience and exposure on top of their classes at the polytechnics or ITE.\n\nDouglas Foo, the executive chairman of Sakae Holdings, the company that owns the Sakae Sushi chain of restaurants, hailed the move as one that was timely at a time when Singapore was facing a manpower crunch.\n\nHe spoke of his company's long-term plan to eventually open 30,000 restaurants around the world, with each requiring about ten people to run.\n\n\"That is 300,000 people, and we need to train them from a young age. If we can do that at a very deep level, in terms of the skills they pick up, I think that will help put us on the global stage,\" he said.\n\nLim Boon Huat, the managing director of Rohde & Schwarz Asia, noted that while it was possible for people to easily pick up a new skill, it was not so easy to put that skill into practice.\n\n\"It's important that we help our young people to secure a place in the industry to practice their skills,\" said Dr Lim. \"I see the place-and-train initiative as helping to strengthen our skills development. When you get to place your learning with the experience you gather, that learning becomes deep and insightful.\"\n\nMark Hall, vice-president and country manager of recruitment consultancy Kelly Services Singapore, said that industry placements are a \"tried and tested\" method for giving students actual workplace experience.\n\nHe shared how his recruitment consultancy currently has a tie-up with Temasek Polytechnic where it runs a career centre to invigorate studies with work experience.\n\n\"For those students who show keen interest and do well during their course (at the career centre), they will have an opportunity to have their industrial attachments at Kelly Services office,\" he said.\n\n\"This will definitely make them more work-ready on graduation and open up more work opportunities. Companies are also likely to benefit as fresh graduates will already have relevant skills and experience, meaning a larger pool of talent to select from.\"\n\nChoo Chiau Beng, the senior advisor at Keppel Corporation, spoke of the growing need to give young people all the help and guidance to develop them using different pathways.\n\n\"As a society, we must value and respect every job that people do. There should not be a glass ceiling if you don't have a degree or you're not a scholar. We should make the best use of every individual and let them develop to their full capabilities,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Core inflation strips out accommodation and private road transport costs.\n\nWith core inflation projected to stay elevated at 2-3 per cent in 2014, economists agree that the central bank will stick to its current monetary policy stance at its next review in October, allowing for a gradual appreciation in the trade-weighted Singapore dollar.\n\nJuly's benign inflation rate surprised private-sector economists, who were expecting an unchanged reading from June's 1.8 per cent. In fact, of the 21 analysts polled by Bloomberg before the Department of Statistics released the data on Monday, only one projected an increase of below 1.3 per cent.\n\nThe key driver behind last month's easing was the 1.6 per cent drop in private road transport costs, following the 2.8 per cent increase in June.\n\nSaid the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) in joint comments: \"This mainly reflects the high base last year when COE (Certificate of Entitlement) premiums surged, while petrol pump prices also rose at a slower pace of 3.1 per cent, compared to 6.4 per cent a month ago.\"\n\nGiven the soft housing rental market, accommodation costs were largely unchanged last month, after rising by 0.5 per cent in June. On a month-on-month basis, accommodation costs fell by 2 per cent, largely reflecting the disbursement of Service & Conservancy Charges rebates for HDB households.\n\nSince July's low inflation reading was largely due to a drop in car prices and the stabilising of accommodation costs, economists including CIMB's Song Seng Wun cautioned against getting carried away by the \"misleading\" headline number.\n\n\"After all, we don't go out and buy a car or rent a home everyday. For the average household, core inflation is still more important,\" said Mr Song.\n\nAdded UOB's Francis Tan: \"People shouldn't react to July's 1.2 per cent (figure) - it's impacted by private road transport costs, and base effects mean this will swing up and down. What's more important is core inflation, because it better represents the broad underlying price trends in the economy. And as we saw in July, services inflation will still edge upwards slowly - especially in the more labour-intensive segments.\"\n\nServices inflation was higher at 2.5 per cent last month, compared to 2.2 per cent in June. This was led by stronger increases in pre-school fees, medical treatment costs, and holiday travel expenses.\n\nThe pick-up in services inflation meant that core inflation inched up to 2.2 per cent in July from 2.1 per cent a month ago. Economists expect this to continue, given the structurally tight labour market.\n\nSaid CIMB's Mr Song: \"I'm a bit surprised that the pass-through of costs has been relatively mild so far. Perhaps it's competitive pressure that has been holding firms back from passing on their higher costs to consumers - but I don't think we'll see that for much longer.\"\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch economist Chua Hak Bin expects core inflation to remain above 2 per cent as wages rise, citing recent moves to raise the monthly wages of cleaners, security guards, and nurses, as well July's foreign worker levy hikes.\n\nAnd while food inflation eased in July to 3 per cent from June's 3.2 per cent - due to a more moderate rise in the prices of non-cooked food items and prepared meals - OCBC's Selena Ling thinks seasonal increases in food prices will exert further upward pressure on core inflation in the second half of this year.\n\nAt least two banks cut their 2014 headline inflation forecasts on Monday after the data release: OCBC now expects inflation to come in at 1.5 per cent (from 1.7 per cent previously), while UOB thinks 1.6 per cent is likely (from 2 per cent before).\n\nAs for official estimates, the MAS and MTI reiterated their inflation forecasts for 2014 - headline inflation is projected to come in at 1.5-2 per cent, while core inflation will \"stay elevated\" at 2-3 per cent.\n\nIndeed, economists expect the divergence between headline and core inflation to expand further in the coming months.\n\nSaid Credit Suisse's Michael Wan of the monetary policy implications: \"The main concern for MAS going forward continues to be the tight labour market and the prospect of rising wage growth feeding into core inflationary pressures, in our view. As such, we believe MAS will continue to keep its tight exchange rate stance on hold in October.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They began their work in January this year and canvassed the views of about 20,000 people, including students, parents and polytechnic and ITE staff.\n\nAmong the 10 recommendations is a proposal to launch new programmes that integrate work and study, such as place-and-train schemes that are similar to the apprenticeship models in Germany and Switzerland.\n\nThe idea is to pilot this scheme from 2016 in selected sectors, and give those who have completed their basic studies at the ITE and polytechnics the chance to work at a company and draw a monthly salary, while still being able to attend classes.\n\nAnother key recommendation is to employ trained career guidance officers to help students in secondary schools, junior colleges (JCs), polytechnics and the ITE to make informed choices about their education and careers.\n\nThe committee proposed having one such education and career guidance officer for every five schools and JCs, and three to five of them in each of Singapore's five polytechnics and three ITE colleges.\n\n\"We want to support our young in realising their aspirations,\" said Ms Indranee during a press conference held at Singapore Polytechnic. \"There should be opportunities for all to realise their potential and progress in life, no matter what the starting point.\"\n\nShe cited two conditions that were needed to succeed - a strong economy and good growth to create jobs for young Singaporeans; and a strong alignment between industry needs, economic opportunities and the skills of the workforce.\n\n\"We are recommending to develop multiple pathways, and create more options for skills to be acquired, recognised and rewarded,\" she said. \"This means giving opportunities to acquire technical and soft skills that can count towards their careers.\"\n\nCommenting on the recommendations, Education Minister Heng Swee Keat noted three significant shifts in the thinking about learning and jobs for young Singaporeans.\n\nHe said that Singapore needed to have a stronger emphasis on skills and applied learning, that learning must be continual and lifelong, and that it was important to encourage multiple pathways for development, in study and at work.\n\n\"We must break the boundary between learning in the classrooms and learning at work. The workplace must become a great learning place,\" said Mr Heng.\n\nAs part of the plan to invest further in the polytechnics and the ITE to strengthen their model of applied education, the government announced on Monday that polytechnics will, from 2015, start a pilot scheme to enhance internships in selected sectors such as early childhood education and hotel operations and management.\n\nThe Education Ministry will also work with polytechnics and ITE to identify \"lead institutions\" for key industry sectors, starting with Singapore Polytechnic for food technology, Ngee Ann Polytechnic for marine and offshore engineering and Republic Polytechnic for logistics.\n\nIn all, the committee engaged with 20,000 people, including students, polytechnic and ITE alumni and staff, parents and teachers. It also reached out to employers, unions and economic agencies. The committee also visited Germany, Australia, Switzerland and New Zealand to study their applied education models.\n\nWith its work now complete, a new tripartite committee to be headed by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam will be set up to follow through with its recommendations.\n\nThe full Aspire report can be found at\n\nwww.moe.gov.sg/aspirereport\n\n.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Also known as Teo Woon Tiong, the 95-year-old father of former Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) and chairman of the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) Teo Siong Seng, co-founded PIL in 1967, growing it to one of the largest shipping companies in the world with a fleet of 180 ships. The group's Hong Kong-listed Singamas Container Holdings is also one of the largest container manufacturers in the world.\n\nTwo places below him in the list is 70-year-old Lim Oon Kuin who made his US$2 billion in oil trading and shipping. He began his trade more than 50 years ago with one truck delivering diesel to fishermen, but that did not stop him from being the 14th richest man in Singapore, according to the list, as he built his privately owned Hin Leong Trading into one of Singapore's biggest oil traders with estimated revenues of US$14 billion.\n\nThe group is rapidly expanding in Myanmar and Mr Lim also has a 65 per cent stake in Asia's largest oil terminal, Universal Terminal. The group's shipping arm, Ocean Tankers, has a fleet of 130 vessels.\n\nTan Boy Tee, a well-known figure in Singapore's offshore & marine sector, sits in 29th position on the list with a net worth of US$915 million. The founder of tug and barge operator Labroy Marine, which he sold in 2008, now owns stakes in offshore firms Ezion Holdings and Viking Offshore & Marine, as well as in private equity fund Tembusu Partners and investment advisory firm Bestford Capital.\n\nThe successful and popular IPO of Pacific Radiance last year gives its founder Pang Yoke Min a debut on the list in the 41st position. With a net worth of US$655 million, the shipping veteran owns a 65 per cent stake in Pacific Radiance, which he co-founded in 2006 with Sonny Mok, a former colleague at Jaya Holdings, another offshore & marine company that Mr Pang had also co-founded in 1981 and retired from after 25 years. His other interests include stakes in Swiber Holdings, Global Yellow Pages and Pacific Healthcare, in which he is also a board member.\n\nThe co-founders of logistics firm C&P, Loi Kai Meng (number 42) and Stanley Liao (number 46), are also on the list with their stakes in listed unit CWT, helping them build a wealth of US$605 million and US$540 million, respectively.\n\nThe accumulated wealth of these six individuals accounts for more than 7 per cent of the aggregate wealth of US$96.9 billion of the entire 50 on the list.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Bidders may tender for any or all of the units.\n\nThe offering comprises two units of 3,100 square feet and 4,300 square feet on the ground floor that can be used for warehouse or factory space, and five units on the third floor that range from 2,100 sq ft to 2,400 sq ft. The total floor area of the units is 18,800 sq ft.\n\nThere are just over 45 years left on the tenure of the 99-year leasehold properties.\n\nSix of the units are currently tenanted, with a gross yield of about 5 per cent, JLL national director for investments Yong Choon Fah said.\n\nThe vendors are hoping for offers of more than S$10 million for all seven units, or north of S$620 per square foot for the ground floor units and S$480 per square foot for the third floor units.\n\nThe five-storey Kewalram House was built in the 1980s with 63 units on a site zoned for Business 1, or for clean and light industry. The gross floor area of the building relative to the site area is still within the maximum plot ratio of 2.5.\n\nJLL is noting the potential for an en bloc sale as part of its marketing strategy.\n\n\"There could be potential for future en bloc opportunity as the gross floor area (GFA) of the building has not exceeded the maximum GFA allowed under the Master Plan 2014,\" Ms Yong said.\n\n\"The units for sale represent around 9.6 per cent of the total share value and 9.3 per cent of the total strata area in the development,\" she added.\n\nThe long remaining tenure is also being stressed. Ms Yong noted that most industrial land parcels being offered by the government are now capped at 30 years, about 15 years less than the remaining tenure on the Kewalram units.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It plans to shed more than a quarter of its full-time employees by 2018.\n\nThai Airways has also vowed to boost revenue and transform itself into a worldclass carrier again in the next five years.\n\nThe airline has yet to say how it would achieve that goal exactly.\n\nActing president Air Chief Marshall Siwakiat Jayema told reporters on Monday that the airline would re-work its business strategy plan after an initial proposal was rejected by a military-appointed committee overseeing state enterprises.\n\nThe committee widely known as the \"super board\" was set up by Thailand's military government to scrutinise operations of state companies. Thai Airways is at the top of the junta's list of firms to undergo restructuring.\n\n\"The super board has asked the Thai Air board to work on details of the restructuring because the existing plan has no details on how the airline will become a leader in the region and on the appropriate size of its fleet,\" the air chief marshall said.\n\nThe airline will hold the next board meeting on Friday to set up a new board to draft the plan, he said, adding that Thai Airways' plan to seek 20 billion baht (S$781.6 million) in loans would be delayed pending the approval of the restructuring plan.\n\nThe proposal to cut 1,500 jobs this year is not affected.\n\nCaptain Montree Jumrieng, executive vice-president of the airline, said that the appropriate number of aircraft in Thai Airway's fleet should be 80 versus 100 now, and the appropriate number of employees should be 18,000 versus 24,000 currently.\n\nAs at this month, Thai Airways had 1,350 pilots.\n\nThe airline recruits about 100 student pilots every year, and they undergo a two-year training programme that costs about four million baht per student pilot, Lt Athisak said. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/439ab83c1d0720f503d34de660f07eecc5352bda4173db4eb53a42d1d1eda24c?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Excess baggage: The airline posted losses for five straight quarters.

UE said earlier in August that it is divesting indirect subsidiary MFS Technology for S$124 million.\n\nWearnes distributes luxury cars in South-east Asia, including brands like Bentley, Bugatti, McLaren, Jaguar, Land Rover, Infiniti, BMW and Volvo.\n\nAccording to a Bloom-berg report, the buyer is Malaysian conglomerate Samling Group, which distributes Bentleys in Malaysia and is an authorised dealer of Mitsubishi and Honda vehicles there.\n\nSamling also has other businesses in plantations, timber and property development.\n\nLast Thursday, UE said that it was \"in advanced stages of discussions regarding the sale of a non-core business\".\n\nIt also revealed that the company itself is in play, after a Singapore Exchange query prompted by a 17 cent rise, or 7.4 per cent, in its share price to S$2.46.\n\nThai tycoon Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi is understood to be interested in the company and has approached UE's controlling shareholders OCBC Bank and Great Eastern.\n\nIn contrast to the non-core asset sale of Wearnes, which looks to be wrapped up soon, discussions between OCBC, Great Eastern and the third party interested in their UE stake are \"preliminary\", UE said.\n\nLast Friday, following the disclosures, UE shares jumped 30 cents to close at S$2.76. As OCBC, Great Eastern and OCBC's Lee family own a combined 34 per cent stake in UE, a sale could trigger a general offer for the company.\n\nMeanwhile, a sale of Wearnes Automotive - unrelated to the offer for UE shares - would boost UE's cash reserves.\n\nAt end-June, UE had S$6.3 billion of assets including S$744 million of cash. But it also had S$2.7 billion of debt, a significant amount of which was incurred to fund its takeover of WBL Corp last June. WBL was a conglomerate that included Wearnes, tech businesses and property. At that time, UE had said that recurring earnings from Wearnes could smooth out its lumpy property earnings.\n\nBut by October last year, UE was reportedly looking to sell the auto business.\n\nThis June, Hong Kong's Swire Pacific, United Arab Emirates' Al-Futtaim group, hotel and property company OUE and a Malaysian car distributor were reported to be in the running to buy Wearnes Automotive.\n\nUE shares were halted from trading yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is welcome as it gives them more control over how they would like to fund their retirement. But how the lump sum withdrawal will affect their monthly CPF payouts remains to be seen and it is unclear how the government will value the leases it purchases. The changes announced by the Prime Minister during the National Day Rally are part of a long-term effort to rebalance the CPF in the direction of greater individual choice.\n\nWhile these latest initiatives largely focus on providing a lifeline to low-income groups, in the long term the fund must evolve into a wealth management tool for all its members. The key issue is not how to disburse funds but how to ensure the greatest possible accumulation of wealth. This can be achieved by turning savers into investors. While these initiatives represent a first step in this direction, in the long term more management choices earlier on is the only way forward. Greater two-way interaction between CPF and its members will be appreciated by all parties.\n\nLance Tay\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nTokio Marine Life Insurance Singapore Ltd\n\nMANY retirees will welcome a lump sum withdrawal. By capping it at, say, 20 per cent, a balance is struck between the desire of some Singaporeans to manage their own funds and securing a minimum retirement income. Singaporeans can decide if they would like to earn guaranteed interest by not touching their CPF money or to withdraw the funds for personal use.\n\nWe need to exercise this flexibility with caution and provide public education to help people make an informed decision. With rising living costs, longer life expectancy and inflationary effects, Singaporeans may not achieve their desired retirement lifestyles with CPF Life payouts alone without supplementing that with, for example, a private retirement plan that provides lifetime payouts.\n\nThe extension of the Lease Buyback Scheme is practical for those who wish to monetise the value of their flats to augment their retirement funding. This, however, compromises the wishes of those who would like to bequeath their flats to their children as part of legacy planning, and highlights how holistic financial counselling and forward planning can better prepare us for retirement.\n\nSam Yap\n\nGroup Executive Chairman and Co-Founder\n\nHtwo Investment Holdings Pte Ltd\n\nTHE Prime Minister's announcement regarding the changes to the CPF scheme may appease those who want to manage their own funds. Allowing members to invest their CPF funds for higher returns is good but retirees must be financially competent and savvy to do so. How about more incentives for retirees to keep their savings with the CPF? The problem with some retirees is when they get a lump sum of money in hand, there could be a tendency to spend it too fast, leaving precious little for later years.\n\nThe extension of the Lease Buyback Scheme to four-room flats gives retirees another financing option to support themselves in old age. However, I think not many will rush on this offer as people generally cherish possession of their HDB flat. There is also a need to study what happens if retirees on the scheme outlive the 30-year lease. Hopefully, the new options provided will not generate other sets of problems that will be an issue for society or the government to grapple with in future.\n\nJoshua Yim\n\nCEO\n\nAchieve Group\n\nTHE extension of the Lease Buyback Scheme to four-room flats is definitely a welcome move as it helps the HDB owner unlock the value of the property. Going a step further, I'm advocating that it should be extended to five-room flats. When a flat owner dies, those inheriting the property will stand to gain. But the retirees should be the ones enjoying the fruits of their labour while they are still around. With regard to the lump sum withdrawal, this shows that the government has, first and foremost, heard the voices of the people by releasing the money to them and, second, is making it possible for them to enjoy their hard-earned savings.\n\nWhile it is a good gesture to give people autonomy to enjoy their savings, my concern, on the other hand, is on the social implications if these retirees squander away their money. Or if they fall victim to scams, given the many stories we have heard of seniors getting cheated. Policymakers should review the CPF scheme to consider putting in place some mechanism to help members safeguard their money. Perhaps there should be certain criteria or parameters in place, such as having the withdrawals capped at certain percentages and at yearly intervals.\n\nThe issue of the Minimum Sum being raised is purely mathematics. Everyone will need to retire at some point and only a small percentage of people will have recurring income from investments. Some may not even have private health insurance policies to see them through. The majority may need to rely only on their CPF savings to support themselves. During the rally, PM Lee polled the audience and it was clear that most people feel they need about S$2,000 a month during retirement. Will the Minimum Sum of S$161,000 be able to sustain a monthly payout of S$2,000 till the last day of the person's life? Thus, the raising of the Minimum Sum is absolutely necessary and, in fact, I feel it should be even higher and increased on a yearly basis to keep step with inflation. Having more money in the CPF account is a good thing, in case people live another 30 years after retiring because if the money runs out, the individual will be in a very sad situation. Some people don't believe in buying insurance so this form of forced savings is good and necessary in order to avoid any potential blowup of social welfare issues. From a macro perspective, I feel these changes are very fair and show that the government is trying to protect its people.\n\nMagnus B\u00f6cker\n\nCEO, SGX\n\nDESPITE being a young nation, Singapore is well known to have one of the world's highest saving levels. We work hard for our money yet not many of us do enough to have our money work hard for us. I am supportive of the recent CPF refinements that enable retired Singaporeans to have extra funds to enjoy or put into investments. I an't stress enough the importance of financial literacy and benefits of long-term investment for a more secure retirement.\n\nTo many Singaporeans who don't have well-diversified CPF savings now, sound investment decisions can be made only if each of us is well-informed and has a strong understanding of risks and rewards. At SGX, we will therefore continue to support investors in their efforts to better protect and grow their investments.\n\nRobin C Lee\n\nGroup COO\n\nBok Seng Group\n\nWHEN it comes to the care of our senior folks, careful yet tough decisions often have to be made by the government. On the one hand, there is a need to help them stash sufficient reserves away to cover their retirement years and, at the same time, get them to understand the necessity of doing so. Yet I also feel that everyone is entitled to his or her own decisions and lifestyles. Therefore, in my opinion, the new Silver Support Bonus Scheme and the latest changes in the CPF scheme to allow a lump sum withdrawal of perhaps up to 20 per cent are well thought-through proposals that allow us to move in the right direction. It's about time we Singaporeans take responsibility for our own actions and be heedful of the consequences of early gratification by blowing away one's saving too rapidly.\n\nThe current payout based on the Minimum Sum drawdown after 65 years of age is barely going to be adequate for most amid escalating costs of living. Therefore, if needed, the Lease Buyback Scheme is a good way to enable retirees to cash-in the portion of the property that they may not get to use to obtain more cash in hand. This should, on a needs basis, eventually also extend to flats bigger than four rooms.\n\nNishit Majmudar\n\nCEO\n\nAviva Singapore\n\nI APPLAUD the government for leading the national dialogue to address the concerns of many Singaporeans. Financing of retirement is a challenge worldwide with increasing longevity and low interest rates. Singapore is no exception. Withdrawal of lump sum amounts provides Singaporeans with greater flexibility but they will need to demonstrate greater responsibility to ensure they do not jeopardise their long-term retirement. The long debate around such a change will hopefully serve to educate all Singaporeans to be responsible spenders of their own money. My hope is that Singaporeans will avail themselves to expert financial advice before they decide on how they spend the lump sum withdrawal. We at Aviva will work hard to provide Singaporeans quality advice and retirement solutions to enable them to be well prepared for their silver years. Overall, this change seems to be the right balance such that the government continues to provide the financing framework, while individuals have greater flexibility in the use of their money.\n\nChristophe Duchatellier\n\nCEO\n\nAdecco Asia\n\nTHE world of work is evolving - people are living longer and the retirement age is going up. It is good that the government is continually addressing the changing demographics of the workforce and that it remains responsive to this. By allowing retirees to withdraw lump sum amounts, this flexibility provides CPF members with more control on managing their finances. Therefore, financial planning should be prioritised so that elderly citizens would take steps not to misuse this flexibility and to manage their lower monthly payouts. To further ensure financial security, they might consider pushing back their retirement.\n\nFrom a human resource perspective, it would be good if companies take the initiative to explain career progression to their employees, thereby supporting them with a solid career path if they choose to postpone their retirement. As employers, we too need to reassure our staff that they will be taken care of in the long term.\n\nJack Chua\n\nCEO\n\nERA Singapore\n\nBY allowing retirees to withdraw a lump sum from their CPF subject to a limit, it gives them the option of having a capital sum at hand should the need arise - for example, a family emergency. However, by withdrawing the lump sum, these retirees would have a smaller amount in the CPF and this would mean a lower monthly payout from the CPF.\n\nIt is a good move by the government to extend the Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS) to owners of four-room HDB flats, which account for the majority of HDB flats in Singapore. So, with this extension, most HDB flat owners will now have this additional monetisation option to tap should they need to.\n\nThe Prime Minister has explained very clearly and simply the monetisation options available. The government will need to continue this communication to the masses so that they can understand all the options available.\n\nThe LBS enables the elderly, especially those who are sentimental about their homes, to continue to live in the neighbourhood they have become familiar with. Those likely to take up the LBS are the elderly with no immediate need of a sizeable capital sum and are reluctant to uproot from their current flat location. Those in need of a sizeable capital sum are likely to consider the right-sizing option - i.e. sell off their current flat and ''right-size'' to a studio apartment.\n\nUnder the LBS, the flat owners get a small lump sum upfront and also a modest monthly income stream for the remaining 30 years lease of their flat. However, this monthly sum is less than what they can get should they sublet the whole flat.\n\nOnce they have taken up the LBS, the flat cannot be sold in the resale market anymore. If they do not need it anymore, they can only sell it back to the HDB; they cannot bequeath the flat to their children. They are also not allowed to sublet the whole flat. Should they outlive the 30 years lease, an application for extension can be made to the HDB on a case-by-case basis, so there are no worries of not having a flat to live in.\n\nChris Comer\n\nCEO\n\nCastlewood Group\n\nPM Lee Hsien Loong's announcement on the changes to the CPF scheme is a welcome shift as Singapore continues to adapt to the country's changing socio-economic structure. It is no secret that an increasing number of Singaporeans can be described as ''asset rich, cash-poor'' due to limited access to cash. I believe that for these individuals, the ability to withdraw lump sums from their CPF savings is hugely beneficial as they can fulfil long-held dreams or fund unforeseen emergencies. But there is also the risk of retirees now accessing funds at their whim, potentially ignoring long-term implications of lower monthly payouts and as a result finding themselves in a much more difficult financial situation in the years ahead.\n\nRetirement financing is a hot topic as it is well documented that Singaporeans, like all people, are living longer and therefore require sufficient funds to support themselves through the later years. I feel that the Lease Buyback Scheme does offer a solution to retirees looking to liquidate their assets. However, no scheme is perfect so additional consideration has to be taken as the current offer of a 30-year lease in exchange for cash may not support the resident's entire lifespan. While the HDB has given the assurance that no one will be left homeless, sufficient contingency plans will need to be put in place specifically detailing what will happen if the resident outlives the reduced lease. While these changes are a step in the right direction, long-term solutions still need to be found for funding the nation's elderly for the duration of their golden years.\n\nScott Burnett\n\nManaging Director for South East Asia\n\nTowers Watson\n\nFLEXIBILITY is one of the key benefits of the proposed changes, in particular allowing retirees to withdraw lump sum amounts, which should address recent public debate about access to CPF funds. However, taking more money out earlier means that there is less left over during retirement. Individuals need to understand the tradeoff between lifetime retirement income under CPF Life and withdrawing a lump sum which may be used up quickly. The extension of the Lease Buyback Scheme will enable a wider segment of Singaporeans to use their property to fund their retirement.\n\nAdequacy of income in retirement is a concern for many Singaporeans. Based on a Towers Watson survey of HR professionals conducted in February 2014, almost three-quarters of some 200 respondents said they were not saving enough. The government should look into promoting other pillars of retirement savings, for example, improving the framework for supplementary employer-sponsored retirement plans.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPLAN-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\nCPF is a savings account. It is not an investment account. The two have different, if not contradictory, purposes. CPF members cannot expect the principal sum - i.e. the Minimum Sum - to be protected or guaranteed while at the same time enjoy high returns. As a savings account, there is almost no risk, but the returns cannot be high like with a high-risk investment account. CPF members must understand and accept these pros and cons. The government is correct to keep the goal of the CPF sacrosanct - as savings for retirement. CPF has also been generous in offering a yield or interest rate that is substantially higher than the market. Members should be appreciative of this.\n\nI am concerned that the move to allow a lump sum withdrawal will open a Pandora's Box into the future. If more is allowed, it would negate the purpose of the CPF. I recognise that CPF funds are members' money, and, therefore, they are technically entitled to decide how they want to use it. But while this flexibility will solve a current problem or need, it will create a future problem, when savings become insufficient for retirement. As it stands today, the Minimum Sum is barely enough to support the lifestyle of the average man in the street. I am for the raising of the Minimum Sum next year. I am in favour of monetisation of assets like the Lease Buyback Scheme or reverse mortgages to generate cash to meet the needs of members, be it for pleasure, as in travel to enjoy their retirement, or to meet expenses. In this regard, members do have a choice to keep their CPF savings intact to provide a long stream of annuity payments or benefiting from a lump sum to meet cash needs. Members should resist any temptation for a short-term gain at the expense of long-term security or comfort in later years. It is prudent to let the CPF continue to be our custodian of a portion of our savings - for all we know, it may be all that we have for our retirement.\n\nLow Lee Yong\n\nCEO\n\nMHC Asia Group Pte Ltd\n\nI THINK it is a good sign of a maturing government understanding that people should be given more autonomy over their CPF savings. This will appeal most to the lower income group by allowing them flexibility to enjoy the fruits of their labour earlier. We may worry about some elderly people squandering their lump sum withdrawals - which is why having a cap of perhaps 20 per cent is a wise move.\n\nTo further prevent abuse, more public education and counselling should be provided. The system will not be perfect at the start but can be gradually tweaked with the help of public feedback as we move along. As for the Lease Buyback Scheme, more homeowners can have the assurance that they can age gracefully in their ''family home''. This definitely appeals to the Asian mindset of having a place to call home and a familiar final resting place.\n\nDora Hoan\n\nCo-Chairman/Group CEO\n\nBest World International Ltd\n\nI APPLAUD the decision to allow a partial lump sum withdrawal for retirees. While the existing CPF measures provide for the long-term financial security of citizens, many face cash shortages for daily needs. Given such anxieties, they would not see the goodwill of our government. As a result, the CPF has become a contentious issue. Therefore, the proposed changes are timely and beneficial for both the people and the government. Nevertheless, I feel that the proposed moves can be further enhanced. For instance, instead of a 20 per cent cap, the government can consider allowing citizens a lump sum withdrawal of 50 per cent upon reaching 65 years old and then a further 5 per cent for every subsequent year, subject to a one-off payment for medical insurance. Rising medical cost is also a big concern among Singaporeans and their families; these moves will give them peace of mind for the present and future.\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nI FOUND the explanation of the changes to the CPF scheme very clear and helpful, especially as many people were still unaware or confused about previously announced changes like the increase in the Minimum Sum, for example. The new lump sum CPF withdrawal should come as welcome to those who really need the money for whatever purposes, be it for a sudden family emergency or to finally go on a dream holiday. It is certainly good news for those who have already hit 65 years of age. On the flip side, however, if this is not managed prudently, retirees could end up worse off if they draw out too much, leaving too little for their monthly payouts. After all, people can easily live a good 20 or more years after retirement these days.\n\nAnyway, more details about the lump sum withdrawal will be forthcoming so it is perhaps too early to judge right now. As for the extension of the Lease Buyback Scheme to four-room flats, this is a very timely initiative given Singapore's ageing population and growing cohort of baby boomers approaching retirement age. It is great that there is now this additional option for them to monetise their flats compared with the common suggestion of downgrading to a smaller one. Overall, I believe that these changes do go some way towards managing Singaporeans' needs and expectations.\n\nAlfred Chia\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nSingCapital Pte Ltd\n\nWHILE it is heartening to know that the government is listening to the people to be more flexible with CPF withdrawals, I'm concerned for members who are not careful with their finances. This is especially so if one is old and unable to work as any squandering of the retirement funds will have dire consequences.\n\nWhile it is understandable that members want to have control of their money, there is another group of people who are happy to top up their CPF savings to enjoy the generous risk-free 4 per cent returns. It is important to step up financial education so that there is a balance of autonomy for CPF members and provision of retirement funding. The extension of the HDB's Lease Buyback Scheme to four-room flats provides an additional option for retirement funding. Generally, we have more options for retirement funding - which should provide comfort but not a false sense that retirement is well taken care of.\n\nToby Koh\n\nGroup Managing Director\n\nAdemco Security Group\n\nTHE new initiatives put forth by the Prime Minister, particularly the lump sum CPF withdrawal, are certainly welcomed by the general public. It is a positive move for many but the government will have to consider carefully the consequences and wider impact if a big number of retirees run out of savings. Perhaps the CPF Board can even encourage more people to save by having more flexible withdrawal schemes for older citizens and enticing them with superior interest-rate returns compared with the banking sector. This may then cause one to rethink whether a lump sum withdrawal is financially rewarding when compared with leaving their funds in the CPF.\n\nThirumalai Chandroo\n\nChairman/CEO\n\nModern Montessori International Group\n\nTHE secret of Singapore's success, I believe, has been its sound policy implementations. The various CPF measures and the Lease Buyback Scheme may seem confusing at first, but each does extend its own benefits. The proposed lump sum withdrawal allows retirees to enjoy the fruits of their labour after years of hard work. At the same time it is important for the CPF Board to educate the public about the expected value of their CPF savings in the later years - perhaps with a personal understanding of how the scheme benefits them, the importance of securing a healthy CPF balance will be better appreciated.\n\nThe Lease Buyback Scheme is a good way for retirees to monetise the value of their real estate during their later years. The extension of the scheme to four-room flats means that a much bigger group of citizens stand to reap the benefits. These moves allow flexibility and Singaporeans have to learn to make sense of the changes. The efficacy of the policies will be seen in due course. The schemes certainly show promise, particularly that Singapore has a responsive government that takes heed of feedback. They make informed decisions and the peoples' voice certainly takes precedence.\n\nAnnie Yap\n\nManaging Director\n\nAYP Associates Pte Ltd\n\nTHE first advantage would be the greater flexibility that retired Singaporeans have in managing their own funds. Second, it would be the ''peace of mind'' that their hard-earned money is not ''stuck'' in the CPF and can be used to address any short-term cash-flow needs. With measures in place to prevent over-withdrawing, there are actually no ''cons'' to the changes.\n\nHowever, as with every scheme, the take-up rate remains to be seen. The Lease Buyback Scheme which has been in place since 2009 has not been well taken up as the elderly may fear that they will not have a place to stay in should they outlive the remaining lease. They also tend to prefer to leave a house to their children. Hence it would be more of a mindset change in determining if the extension of the Lease Buyback Scheme would become an effective source of income for retirees.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This presents a sweet spot for urban solution experts to enter and create blueprints for their cities, so that they can develop organically and systematically, rather than haphazardly.\n\nOne such company is Surbana, which recently made further inroads into Africa with a contract to help the Burundi government draw up the master plan for Bujumbura, its capital city.\n\nResource-rich Burundi holds a lot of promise for economic growth, despite being stricken with poverty and social problems like HIV proliferation, it says.\n\nThis is Surbana's seventh project in Africa, following earlier ones in South Africa, Republic of Congo, Angola, Rwanda, Nigeria and Mauritius since 2005.\n\nAmong Surbana's most notable projects is its master plan for a district in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, a country notorious for its 1994 genocide which claimed the lives of 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu people.\n\nKong Wy Mun, CEO of Singapore Cooperation Enterprise (SCE), which is partnering Surbana for the Burundi project, said: \"Our team which went to Rwanda to do a scoping visit found that the country has transformed itself and come out very strongly from the genocide.\n\n\"When the genocide happened just 20 years ago, they were really ground zero. Everything was destroyed. But you can see how resilient the society is, how keen and hungry they are, led by President (Paul) Kagame.\"\n\nBesides city planning, SCE - a government outfit formed to share Singapore's development experience with foreign governments - has also brought in players to conduct airport consultancy and revamp Rwanda's workforce development policies and technical vocational education system.\n\nNow the country is enjoying \"political stability and progressive policies\" under the president's iron-fist rule. Reforms have improved its business climate and the government has shown that it is serious about weeding out corruption by locking up unscrupulous ministers. Mr Kagame has not been shy about his vision to turn Rwanda into the Singapore (that is, the financial hub) of central Africa.\n\nAll this has not escaped the attention of neighbouring Burundi. \"They have seen how the Singapore system helped Rwanda - that's how they became keen to use us as a service provider,\" said Surbana CEO Pang Yee Ean.\n\nLouis Tay, Surbana's managing director of aviation, city management and Africa, said the continent is looking for benchmarks as it urbanises, and Singapore stands out for a reason.\n\n\"In the words of Governor (Babatunde) Fashola of Lagos in Nigeria: London and Paris were successful because they had hundreds of years to make mistakes, but Singapore intrigued him because he had seen Singapore advance to first world in his lifetime.\"\n\nBurundi is among the poorest countries in the world, and therefore heavily reliant on foreign aid. Surbana's Burundi project will be funded by the United Nations, which has been helping Burundi with ethnic reconciliation, economic growth and the setting up of institutions, especially after a 13-year civil war ravaged the country and ended only in 2005.\n\nUnlike Rwanda, Burundi has not articulated its vision for the city, but potential abounds, said Mr Pang, given its untapped mineral resources, reasonable political stability (albeit under an authoritarian government) and strategic location in the centre of Africa which makes it a \"very good standoff point for the UN to influence the rest of Africa\".\n\nAnother Singaporean architecture consultant, Jurong International, is currently running a master planning project for a 1,600 hectare special economic zone in Pointe- Noire, the second largest city in the Republic of Congo. It has also completed projects in Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea and South Africa, and is pursuing prospects in more politically stable countries like Tanzania, Kenya and Rwanda.\n\nExplaining the continent's appeal, a spokesman said: \"Africa is seen as the last development frontier continent. The huge young population, growing middle class and abundant natural resources are a magnet for investors and developers. The lack of infrastructure and urban planning in most of its countries means that there are vast opportunities for development.\"\n\nEven though risks like biological hazards, political uncertainty, social unrest and high crime rates continue to plague its less developed countries, Africa's frontier growth is still expected to outpace frontier Asia by 2016, making it the world's fastest expanding region, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n\nBesides Africa, other developing regions - Southeast Asia, South Asia and Latin America - also see their markets for major infrastructural projects dominated by foreign contractors, says assistant professor Oscar Carracedo Garcia-Villalba of the NUS Department of Architecture.\n\nOne academic report said both the local government and the foreign contractor are spurred by different motivations in such partnerships: economic development for the former; and profit first, then altruistic considerations (if at all), for the latter.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Singapore eDevelopment is seeking legal advice.\n\nCCM Industrial was disposed of on May 21 as part of Singapore eDevelopment's restructuring. But the former CCM Group, together with CCM Industrial and CCM Industrial managing director Liew Sen Keong, had all given indemnities as part of a performance bond related to a contract between CCM Industrial and Pan-Asia Logistics Investments.\n\nThe contract was for the building of a four-storey warehouse and office in Tuas.\n\nIn its results announcement for the half-year ended June 30, 2014, Singapore eDevelopment disclosed that it had contingent liabilities from corporate indemnities comprising S$12.3 million, including the performance bond amount related to the Tuas contract.\n\nShares of Singapore eDevelopment closed unchanged at 0.3 Singapore cent on Monday.\n\nThe news about CCM Industrial came a day before Singapore eDevelopment closes the books for a rights issue.\n\nThe company is issuing 12 rights shares at 0.3 Singapore cent each for every share held, and one bonus share for every rights share subscribed for. It hopes to raise between S$3.3 million and S$129.1 million in net proceeds to fund its new business growth in development and info-communications technology (ICT).\n\nSingapore eDevelopment chief executive Chan Heng Fai said in a statement: \"Singapore eDevelopment is transforming itself via international property development and ICT.

Debt is likely to increase by an additional US$90-120 million by year-end 2014, in part, to complete the expansion of the plant.\n\n\"The company's aggressive capital spending for the Korea project, combined with low profitability, has caused the company to consume free cash flow (FCF) and increase debt levels significantly over the last 18 months,\" Ms DiChiara said.\n\n\"Given Moody's expected capex of US$550 million in 2014 and US$450 million in 2015, negative FCF will likely continue through 2015 and leverage will remain in the 3.0x-3.3x range over the same period. At the same time, interest cover, defined as adjusted Ebit/Interest, will remain weakly positioned for the rating at less than 1.75x,\" added Ms DiChiara.\n\nFor the second quarter ended June 30, 2014, STATS ChipPAC reported a net loss of US$4.18 million compared to a net loss of US$52.25 million a year ago, which included plant closure costs of US$36.5 million. Revenue was US$409.91 million versus US$396.37 million a year ago.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The need for such guarantees partly reflects the fact that while Wall Street investment bankers (aided by the World Bank and its various arms) have been only too eager in recent decades to promote international investment in emerging market equities, equal support has not been given to bond market development.\n\nEquity investment implies a degree of shareholder participation in the ownership and control of companies receiving funds whereas investment in the debt securities of emerging markets companies (in Asia as elsewhere) involves nothing beyond a creditor-debtor relationship. To what extent the desire to enjoy such ownership and control from overseas explains the relative rush to develop emerging equity markets, and to what extent it reflects a preference by global institutional investors for short-term counters rather than long-term debt instruments, is debatable. But the fact is that this unbalanced capital market development in emerging economies in and beyond Asia has long gone unrecognised. It illustrates how smart and smooth has been the \"packaging\"of emerging market equities by global investment banks while bond markets have been orphaned by comparison.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Columns\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up", "images": []}

But a recovery in global trade should boost Singapore in particular now, S&P says.\n\nThailand should benefit almost equally with Singapore but the boost to GDP growth from a recovery in global trade shades downward thereafter through the Philippines, China, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan and India with Japan gaining relatively little.\n\nThe S&P report reveals why the performance of Asian economies has been sluggish since the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 dealt a major blow to the US and Europe. \"Intra-regional trade (which constitutes half of total Asia-Pacific exports) still appears driven mostly from outside the region, suggesting a continued dependency of Asia-Pacific economies on the advanced ones,\" it says.\n\n\"Intra-regional trade tracked exports to the US and Europe very closely even though the economic downturn in Asia was less severe.\n\n\"This suggests that Asia-Pacific's trade was dependent on demand in the advanced economies; in other words, demand from Asia has not de-linked from the advanced economies.\"\n\nGiven the relatively high trade dependency in much of the region, the slowdown in global trade \"has clear implications for GDP growth\", says S&P.\n\n\"Lower net exports have reduced GDP growth in Asia-Pacific by about one percentage point, from 5 per cent to 4 per cent, in the post-crisis period, and their contribution to GDP growth has fallen to zero. The effect on larger economies in Asia-Pacific has been more modest than for smaller ones.\"\n\nEach one percentage point rise in growth of global trade volume translates into an increase of a 0.3 to 0.4 percentage point in real GDP of Asian economies, says S&P. \"Looking forward, S&P says that \"our baseline view is that despite the slow start in the first quarter, US growth will pick up toward 3 per cent by the end of this year and maintain this momentum over the next few years. Along with that, US imports should rise and benefit the Asia-Pacific region through higher growth in external demand.\"\n\nBut even with the projected US recovery, \"we expect global trade growth to remain weak and below pre-crisis rates. Trade volume growth for Asia was about 10 per cent annually in the half-decade leading up to the financial crisis, but is now about 6 per cent, and we project it to stay around that rate over the next few years.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is a voluntary move on our part and is not a requirement of the project,\" the spokeswoman, Jill Buchanan, said in an e-mail.\n\nThe Fraser Surrey Docks terminal would handle up to four million tonnes of coal from the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Co each year, loading it on barges bound for Texada Island, north of Vancouver, where it would be transferred to large vessels for export.\n\nDocuments published last year by the port, which is a corporation established by the Canadian government, said that the expansion would bring in one more train and two barges each day. Cheap natural gas and tighter regulation has hurt coal prices in the US in recent years, prompting more producers to look overseas for customers.\n\nPort Metro Vancouver, which handles some US$172 billion in goods traded between more than 160 countries, announced new requirements for the project last fall, including prohibiting on-site coal storage and making barges take extra measures to prevent coal dust from escaping while in transit.- Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

In effect, this will give users a single interface for creating and maintaining a hybrid environment that spans both public and private clouds. The end result is greater agility for businesses across a broader range of workloads - even those that require additional security and compliance, the company says.\n\nCenturyLink's Gery Messer told BizIT that the cloud service would be available across 57 data centres globally including Singapore, Hong Kong, and Tokyo. Mr Messer is the Asia-Pacific MD for CenturyLink Technology Solutions, which is the data hosting operating business unit of CenturyLink.\n\n\"This (cloud service) will be integrated with existing CenturyLink Public Cloud nodes which are currently available in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and the US, and will be integrated with the Singapore cloud node once it is launched later this year,\" he said.\n\nMr Messer notes that the Asia-Pacific region continues to grow both economically and technologically. \"Since 2008, CenturyLink has invested more than US$400 million throughout the region in data centres, network infrastructure and new product offerings to cater to the growing demand for co-location, managed hosting, cloud and network services across the Asia-Pacific.\n\n\"Singapore is used as a regional technology hub by many Asian and global companies due to its stable business landscape, modern infrastructure and central location in the region. Singapore houses CenturyLink's regional sales, marketing and operations headquarters, and we have doubled our headcount in the past three years.\"\n\nHe adds that in order to service the needs of Singaporean customers, as well as those across the region, the company has placed significant investment in Singapore.\n\nThese include two data centres which meet the strict requirements of enterprise customers such as those from financial services, one of the company's three \"Follow-the-Sun\" operations centres which provides 24/7 support to customers around the globe, as well as a Metro Dark Fibre Ring connecting the data centres with other industry data centres across the country, Mr Messer notes.\n\nExpansion plan\n\n\"Our next generation cloud platform - CenturyLink Cloud, will be launched later this year, and represents another multi-million investment for the company. CenturyLink is committed to a multiple-year expansion plan. As we continue to launch new products and expand into new Asia-Pacific markets, we will add additional headcount in our regional Singapore headquarters and country offices.\"\n\nMr Messer adds that despite initially playing catch-up to EMEA and America in adoption rates, cloud computing is gaining rapid momentum in the Asia-Pacific as \"organisations recognise its value in meeting their IT requirements\".\n\nIT analyst firm Frost & Sullivan has indicated that the public cloud services market in the Asia-Pacific is expected to witness strong growth momentum to exceed revenues of US$20 billion in 2018, translating into a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 33.1 per cent between 2013 and 2018.\n\nOne of the key differentiators of the CenturyLink Cloud platform is its opt-in managed services, which allows customers to offload critical IT functions, such as patching and monitoring of the OS (operating system) and applications.\n\nDelivered via a pay-per-use hourly billing model, this can dramatically help reduce time and costs of managing IT.\n\nCommenting on the CenturyLink offering, Melanie Posey, research VP, hosting and managed network services, at IDC said: \"CenturyLink Private Cloud provides a frictionless hybrid cloud option for organisations that want to source private and public cloud services from a single provider and connect cloud with other IT services through an extensive Tier 1 IP network.\"\n\nMr Messer adds that one of the strong value propositions of the company's platforms is its enterprise focus. \"Our cloud technologies are used by some of the largest consumer brands in the world, as well as for the daily transaction of trillions of dollars of the global FX (foreign exchange) market. Any downtime is unacceptable for these types of customers, and is often a deciding factor to select CenturyLink over other technology vendors.\"\n\nThe CenturyLink Cloud is available to organisations seeking cloud services in Europe and North America. \"We have already signed up a number of customers from Singapore, Japan and India on our international cloud nodes, and are seeing strong interest from organizations, in Hong Kong and Australia.\"\n\nCenturyLink is achieving its goal of providing business-friendly hybrid IT solutions aimed at meeting enterprise requirements, Mr Messer adds. Thanks to our global infrastructure, CenturyLink is \"uniquely positioned\" to tailor solutions to the varying and evolving needs of our customers.\n\n\"Our public cloud provides an affordable yet robust public cloud platform backed up by one of the best service level agreements in the industry. The launch of CenturyLink Private Cloud adds to our cloud momentum, re-enforcing our strong position in Gartner's Magic Quadrant as a visionary cloud provider,\" he says.\n\namit@sph.com.sg\n\n@AmitRoyCBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

ICA is one of the most commonly performed diagnostic tests for patients suspected to have heart disease. In light of the advances in imaging of the heart arteries over the last decade, is ICA, which has been the \"gold\" standard for imaging of the heart arteries, still the best choice for you?\n\nThe updated July 2014 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guideline for the diagnosis and management of patients with stable heart disease due to blockage of the heart artery provides answers to this question. The irony is that although ICA has been performed for decades, there is as yet no strong scientific data to provide the basis for recommending an ICA. Furthermore, the guideline states that the potential additional benefit of confirming the presence or absence of blockage of heart arteries by ICA has yet to be confirmed by well designed studies. Hence, the guideline states that there is no strong evidence to support the routine recommendation of ICA for those with suspected blockage of heart arteries. ICA has been the \"gold\" standard by virtue of the fact that it was the only method that could allow the visualisation of the heart arteries in the past. It was basically a case of Hobson's choice. The advancing tide of technology has gradually eroded the value of ICA as a diagnostic tool for heart artery disease in the last decade as seen through the evolution of safer non-invasive methods to visualise the heart arteries, namely the use of computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\nWeighing options\n\nWhat should one do when chest pain occurs and there is reason to suspect underlying heart disease after clinical risk assessment? The current guidelines recommend that the most appropriate first test of choice should be a non-invasive test. Wherever practical, an exercise stress test should be the first test of choice for women with chest pain suspected to have heart disease. For women in particular, tests that involve exposure to X-ray radiation should be avoided and if these tests are necessary, these tests should not result in an X-ray radiation exposure of more than three millisieverts (equivalent to the average background ionising radiation that a person is exposed to annually)\n\nIn practice, if the results of non-invasive testing such as treadmill test, stress echocardiography (ultrasound) or stress nuclear heart scan are inconclusive or of borderline significance, it is a common practice to proceed to do ICA. While this has been a prevalent practice, advances in medical science have provided alternative options. CT scan of the heart arteries may be a more appropriate and a safer alternative than ICA in this situation. Rapid advances in CT technology have resulted in increasing indications for the use of CT scan in place of ICA. CT scan has several advantages over ICA; it can be performed as an outpatient within seconds, is non-invasive, is of lower cost, has lower radiation dosage (for new generation scanners), is three dimensional and can visualise detailed characteristics of the plaque (such as soft or hard plaque, presence and severity of calcium deposits). MRI of the heart arteries is a relatively newer modality which is less readily available but it has the advantages of being non-invasive, performed as outpatient procedure, has absolutely no X-ray radiation, and does not require any injection.\n\nICA carries real risks. The 2012 American College of Cardiology National Cardiovascular Data Registry CathPCI Registry recorded a 1.5 per cent incidence of complications from ICA. Complications included death, stroke, heart attacks, bleeding, infection, allergic reactions, damage to vessels, kidney damage due to contrast, abnormal heart rhythms, and emergency heart bypass surgery. The risk factors are age over 70, severe heart failure, severe valve disease, serious medical conditions, bleeding abnormalities, or allergies to contrast dye. The risk of contrast-induced kidney damage is increased in those with kidney disease or diabetes mellitus. In addition, there are at least six prospective studies that have demonstrated 5 to 22 per cent incidence of silent strokes detected on MRI of the brain following ICA. The long term consequence of silent strokes is memory impairment and cognitive decline. Hence, before ICA is recommended, the patient needs to fully understand the risks associated with the procedure and the results of the ICA must have a significant impact on management decisions. If a patient decides not to have any definitive procedure, such as bypass surgery or stent placement, performed no matter what the findings are or if the general condition of the patient makes bypass surgery or stenting of heart arteries a non-viable option, it is best not to perform an ICA , as there are safer alternatives.\n\nSo when should one consider undergoing an ICA? ICA is considered appropriate in the following situations.\n\nHowever, studies published in recent years have questioned the wisdom of doing an ICA instead of using non-invasive tests such as CT scan, as published registries on ICA in the USA have shown that in the real world experience, for every 100 patients that undergo ICA, about 40 per cent have normal heart arteries and only slightly more than one third have significant heart artery disease. In other words, about 60 per cent of real world patients who underwent ICA do not need an ICA.\n\nIn the past, when the choices were limited, ICA was deemed a \"gold\" standard despite its significant risks and limitations. Unlike CT scan of the heart arteries which provide three dimensional assessment of the heart arteries, ICA can only allow two dimensional visualisation of the lumen of the artery and has significant limitations as the vessel wall cannot be seen. Hence, if there is diffuse disease, it is not possible to quantify the severity of vessel narrowing accurately as there may not be any adjacent normal vessel segment for comparison. Multiple studies have shown that there is significant variability in the assessment of arterial narrowing, especially overestimation of severity for visually assessed narrowing of >50 per cent. ICA is also unable to identify which plaques are likely to result in a heart attack and is also unable to define the functional significance of the narrowing.\n\nRight decision\n\nHence, if you have chest pain on exertion or you have just been told that your treadmill stress test is abnormal, you should consider safer non-invasive alternatives especially if you fall into the category of those at higher risk of complications of ICA. For women and the young, tests that involve exposure to ionising or X-ray radiation should be avoided and where it is necessary, the radiation dosage resulting from the tests should preferably be not more than three millisieverts. CT scan is increasingly used by many physicians as an alternative to ICA and in this 2014 guideline, the committee explicitly wrote that CT scan is \"appropriate and safer\" than ICA in the diagnosis of IHD. Where expertise for MRI of heart arteries is available, it is a good alternative for the young and for women as there is no X-ray radiation. Remember, before confirming a decision on ICA, always look for safer alternatives.\n\nThis series is brought to you by Heart, Stroke and Cancer Centre.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

She acknowledged there is a risk the Fed might misread the degree of slack in the labour market and may need to move rates quickly to catch up. But she said that there is also a chance the economy could disappoint or that pools of sidelined labourers could return to the workforce, easing any inflationary pressures. \"There is no simple recipe for appropriate policy,\" Ms Yellen said, arguing for a \"pragmatic\" approach that allows officials room to evaluate data as it arrives without committing to a preset policy path.\n\nMs Yellen's speech included lengthy references to the possibility that labour markets may in fact be tighter than they seem, and the Fed may be at risk of having to raise rates sooner and faster than expected.\n\nBut the remarks overall marked a defence of her basic premise that the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession damaged the economy and work force in ways that are not fully understood.\n\nThe Fed has held benchmark rates near zero since December 2008, and has said that it would wait a \"considerable time\" after winding down a stimulative bond-buying programme in October before raising them. Financial markets currently expect rates to rise around the middle of next year.\n\nThe debate over Ms Yellen's evaluation of labour markets - and over when to raise borrowing costs - is intensifying within the Fed's policy committee.\n\nSome policymakers, including Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank president Esther George, the host of the conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, are becoming more vocal in their view that the Fed risks falling behind and should raise rates soon.\n\nAt the central bank's last policy meeting last month, some officials argued against characterising the amount of slack in the labour market as \"significant\", which the Fed did in its post-meeting statement. Many officials agreed that characterisation may have to change soon.\n\nDetermining the degree of labour market slack has become the central debate at the Fed. Ms Yellen wants to be sure employment has recovered as fully as possible before raising rates. Inflation \"hawks\" at the Fed, however, worry more months of near-zero rates will cause inflation or possible asset bubbles.\n\nMs Yellen reiterated that the Fed could raise rates sooner than currently expected if the labour market improves more rapidly, and it could tighten monetary policy later if the economy disappoints.\n\nA slate of academic papers at the conference will dissect the issue over the next two days, arguing for example that the United States' job-generating ability may be on the wane.\n\nA handful of workers in green \"What Recovery?\" T-shirts are also staying at the resort, hoping to press the case that many American families are still struggling.

The airline, which is a joint venture between Australia's Qantas, China Eastern Airlines and Hong Kong-based Shun Tak Holdings, applied for regulatory approval in 2012 in the southern Chinese city.\n\nAn airline will be given an operation licence only if its principle place of business and centre of its decision-making is in Hong Kong, according to local laws. \"Jetstar Hong Kong can confirm the sale of a further three aircraft, now a total of six Airbus 320s, with three remaining in the fleet for launch,\" the airline's chief executive officer, Edward Lau, told AFP.\n\nThe airline sold three A320s this month, and three in April.\n\n\"This has been an unfortunate but prudent business decision made by the Jetstar Hong Kong board as the regulatory approvals are taking longer than initially expected,\" Mr Lau said, adding that the sale doesn't affect the firm's readiness once approval is given.\n\nMr Lau said that Jetstar is working \"closely\" with the government and is \"confident of gaining all the necessary approvals\".\n\nThe catalogue price of the latest sale of three A320s this month is US$281.7 million, according to Dow Jones Newswires.\n\nThe regulatory approval for the airline has also faced opposition from the city's flag carrier Cathay Pacific, which says the airline is not based in Hong Kong.\n\n\"The whole Jetstar network is part of an Australian entity and certainly can't pass the test of being principally based here in Hong Kong,\" Cathay chairman John Slosar had said earlier this month, Dow Jones reported.\n\nQantas owns the Jetstar brand and has other joint ventures in Japan, Singapore and Vietnam.\n\nShipping and property giant Shun Tak Holdings, founded by Hong Kong tycoon Stanley Ho, bought a third of Jetstar Hong Kong for US$66 million in June of last year, helping its bid to set up locally.\n\nHong Kong-listed Shun Tak is run by managing director Pansy Ho, daughter of Mr Ho, who is also a Macau casino mogul.\n\nThe low-cost carrier plans to fly to destinations in China, Japan, South Korea and South-east Asia. - AFP\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/more-startups-choose-start-digital-track", "site_title": "More startups choose to start on digital track", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nMore startups choose to start on digital track\n\nBut having a physical outlet remains an option to showcase unique strengths\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Aug 22, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSingapore\n\nA BIGGER and more diverse crop of Singapore startups have been taking the digital track to sell their wares instead of setting up brick-and-mortar outlets - even though it is not necessarily a more cost-effective way, say observers.\n\nStartups used to have to knock on doors, connect with retailers, distributors or influencers, and make pitches to get their product on store shelves; these days, it seems they just need to be \"cool\" in the digital space to pull in followers and customers.\n\nTake for instance, Zimplistic, the homegrown startup behind the popular roti-making machine, Rotimatic. It recently sold out its first pre-order batch in Singapore and the US within a mere week of raising the virtual shutters of the Zimplistic website.\n\nIt made about US$5 million in that time, selling out nearly 8,500 units of Rotimatic.\n\nIts product demonstration video on YouTube has garnered some three million views since last October - an impressive number, given that more than half (53 per cent) of YouTube's videos have under 500 views, said video advertising platform TubeMogul.\n\nZimplistic's co-founder and chief executive officer Rishi Israni told The Business Times: \"Zimplistic's current strategy is to sell the Rotimatic online. The fact that our pre-order batch sold out so fast demonstrates that this strategy works well.\"\n\nA digital strategy was also successful for local tech startup Ractiv and its flagship product, Touch+, a gadget that turns any flat surface into a multi-touch one that controls computer functions.\n\nRactiv's crowdfunding campaign for Touch+ raised more than US$180,000 on Kickstarter last September, exceeding its goal of US$100,000. The startup has since shipped the first batch of Touch + to its backers.\n\nRactiv ran a dedicated channel on YouTube for videos demonstrating the diverse uses of Touch+; the most recent video amassed some 66,000 views in just a week.\n\nRactiv's chief executive officer Darren Lim said he is selling the product only via its website for now, because it is easier and it is still early days in terms of sales.\n\n\"Selling online, including via crowdfunding, enables us to sell to consumers directly and relatively painlessly, and validate their demand too. It helps us reach the audience we want - technology users and early adopters - more effectively than retail channels,\" he said.\n\nSingapore-based wearable tech startup, T.Ware, also chose the digital path, despite having a somewhat unique target audience for its product - a wearable-tech vest providing customisable deep-touch pressure hugs that calm individuals who are feeling anxious or stressed.\n\nThe award-winning T.Jacket is sold and shipped worldwide. Only customers in Singapore and Japan who want to try on the jacket before purchasing it can do so, as T.Ware has distributors only in these two places.\n\nT.Ware's chief executive James Teh said: \"Digital channels play an important role in complementing physical sales, such as for marketing purposes.\"\n\nThe startup's website has an easy-to-use e-cart system, customer testimonials, product demonstration videos and even a jacket-sizing chart, to make it easy for online shoppers.\n\nStill, despite the merits of digital channels, none of these startups has yet ruled out having brick-and-mortar shops.\n\nZimplistic's Mr Israni said he is looking into the possibility of a physical store.\n\nT.Ware's Mr Teh said that, even if the startup were to have a physical store, it would be where its potential customers are, such as in therapy organisations, special-needs schools or shops in hospitals.\n\nRacti's Mr Lim said he will eventually push Touch+ through physical distribution and retail channels; it is just that the process of arranging for distribution will take time.\n\n\"With physical distribution, one has to go through different entities - either a distributor or a retailer or both - and negotiate arrangements such as technical support, credit terms, logistics and price,\" he said.\n\nThat said, brick-and-mortar shops offer a company more exposure and sales volume than online sales can.\n\n\"Even for something like Touch+, its most compelling sales pitch is an in-person demonstration, which is something you can't possibly do online. Physical retail lets you experience technology in an up-close and personal way, which is why people would still purchase television sets or Touch+s at a retail store. Physical familiarity is always more reassuring than information familiarity,\" said Mr Lim.\n\nTraditional retail channels will thus not be obsolete anytime soon, though they may perhaps be re-purposed and re-imagined, he added.\n\nLeading retailers in the US have already coined the term \"omnichannel\" to describe the future customer journey, said Ken Timsit, partner and managing director at BCG Singapore.\n\nShoppers will do their research online, browse the physical store's aisles to get excited about the product or simply as a form of weekend entertainment, and then place their order for it through their smartphones while on the go, or back at home.\n\nMr Timsit said: \"This makes brick-and-mortar shops still highly relevant everywhere in the world - even in countries with high to very-high e-commerce penetration like the US, UK and Germany.\" He pointed out that, contrary to popular belief, it is not always cheaper to sell online than in a physical store. While physical stores face pressure from rising rents and the labour crunch, online stores must bear the costs of home delivery and the ever-increasing cost of being featured on the Google's results page of consumers searching for specific products.\n\nHe said: \"If delivery costs S$5-S$10, depending on speed, and customer acquisition costs up to S$30 per sale for relatively-hot search terms, the cost of online sales can amount to a lot, relative to a product that is low-value.\"\n\nBut for most companies, the promise of e-commerce is not simply lower distribution costs. It is also a matter of building a deeper and more meaningful engagement with customers.\n\nMr Timsit cited Amazon as an example. The diversified e-commerce company knows what its customers buy or don't buy, what they look at and what similar customers have bought. It interacts with its customers much more frequently - at least twice a week - and offers far more relevant suggestions than even the neighbourhood shop.\n\nFor many years now, Singapore has shown extremely high Internet and smartphone penetration, relative to other countries - well above 80 per cent.\n\nYet, its e-commerce penetration remains one of the lowest among developed countries, an estimated 1-3 per cent of retail expenditure, said the BCG executive.\n\nThis perhaps represents a gap that can be plugged and an opportunity that bodes well for Zimplistic, Ractiv and T.Ware, and the likes who have chosen to go the digital way first.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's a bit misleading to talk about tablets as a homogenous category. Apple's iPad and Google Android tablets run streamlined tablet operating systems that don't offer full PC capabilities.\n\nMeanwhile, full-feature Windows tablets have been around for years but were hobbled by weight and brief battery life until the recent advent of flash storage and energy-efficient chips.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Aug 22, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE latest Mazda2's sharp styling is a reflection of the Japanese carmaker's newfound confidence as it puts years of losses behind it and embraces profitability with yet another new model. The small hatchback is the fourth new-generation product since 2011 to embody Mazda's Kodo design and Skyactiv technology.\n\nIt follows the CX5 sport-utility vehicle, the Mazda6 mid-sized sedan and the Mazda3 compact sedan to feature curvaceous styling and a fuel-efficient powertrain within a light but rigid body.\n\nThe fourth-generation Mazda2, which completes the marque's lineup by having a model in each segment, is a core model for the Hiroshima-based manufacturer. More than 2.4 million versions have been sold worldwide since it was introduced in 1996.\n\nUnlike its predecessor though, the new hatch still packs the essentials of a contemporary Mazda with its sophisticated functions despite a smaller package. They include going beyond the image of this segment as well as good driveability, both in the city and over long distances. Some of the equipment offered are the MZD Connect infotainment and connectivity system with a centre display and controller knob; and the i-Activesense safety technology incorporating a camera and near-infrared laser. But the most interesting aspect of this new sub-compact hatch is the way it drives because of the completely rebuilt chassis and body. The new car is slightly longer and taller, with the wheelbase extended by 80 mm to 2,570 mm.\n\nThe pretty hatch gets the deep family-look front grille - large for the diminutive hatch but not disproportionately so - and headlamps with a penetrating stare. The tail lights are especially sleek but what Mazda designer Ryo Yanagisawa is especially proud of is the profile's \"pouncing motion\". Like a cheetah preparing for an explosive start, the Mazda2 has interesting sheet metal for a car in this class.\n\nMost mainstream city cars have a one-box shape for maximum cabin space and utility. But Mazda decided to make the A-pillars more upright and positioned the cabin at the rear of the body. In other words, a similar architecture to the bigger Mazda3 with just as sporty a design.\n\nUnderneath, the suspension continues to utilise front MacPherson struts and a rear torsion beam but both are newly developed, with the former's caster angle increased for straight-line stability while the latter is better able to absorb impact shock for greater ride comfort.\n\nIn line with Mazda's \"car and driver as one\" philosophy, the vehicle dynamics are geared towards predictable vehicle behaviour and ride smoothness that even tries to minimise passenger discomfort under braking and acceleration.\n\nThree new engines and two new transmissions were developed for the Mazda2 - a 1.5-litre turbodiesel, and two naturally aspirated petrol units with 1.3 and 1.5 litres; plus a six-speed manual and a six-speed automatic.\n\nIn the cabin, dramatic design changes mean there are now five styles to choose from, with glossy or matt trim finishes and varying seat patterns and colours.\n\nMost of the design cues are taken from the Mazda3. In the Mazda2, the \"cockpit area\" flanks the driver and steering wheel with two round air vents. There is another circular vent at the other end for the front seat passenger plus one more hidden in the centre of the dashboard for a cleaner look. The fascia itself and the lower centre console wings can be leather-lined and when done so in a contrasting colour, the interior is especially striking.\n\nWith these sweeping changes, the new Mazda2 has raised the bar for city cars.\n\nsamuelee@sph.com.sg\n\nSPECS\n\nMazda2 Skyactiv-G 1.5\n\nEngine\n\n1,496 cc\n\nGearbox\n\n6-speed automatic transmission\n\nMax power\n\n115 hp @ 6,000 rpm\n\nMax torque\n\n148 Nm @ 4,000 rpm\n\n0-100 kmh\n\n10.0 secs\n\nTop speed\n\n184 kmh\n\nCO2 emissions\n\n119 g/km\n\nDistributor\n\nTrans Eurokars\n\nTel\n\n6603 6118\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Daven Wu\n\nPublished Fri, Aug 22, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT'S afternoon in the comforting gloom of the Roman-inspired spa at the Grand Hotel de Bordeaux & Spa.

Two French matrons, cocooned in thick fluffy bathrobes, murmur appreciatively to each other about what an incredible retreat they've stumbled upon.\n\nNot exactly the image one normally associates with Bordeaux, epicentre of the oldest and most famous vineyard in France, but you heard it here first: Bordeaux - the world capital of wine, as well as the splendid spiritual home of first growths Chateaux Margaux, Latour, Haut-Brion and Lafite-Rothschild - is more than \"just\" a wine destination.\n\nIn addition to 300,000 acres (121,406 ha) of vines, 5,000 chateaux, haute gastronomy and 57 categories of fine wines, for the time pressed tourist, especially one who is a teetotaller, on a whirlwind tour of France, Bordeaux offers a wealth of non-alcoholic diversions.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That may change. Tay Suan Chiang meets a few creative florists catering to a growing demand for bespoke flower arrangements\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Aug 22, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nBESPOKE is the new buzzword for all who seek an alternative to mainstream retail. Even as people opt for customised shoes, bags, travel experiences and even cake, why wouldn't flowers be far behind? Sure it's a lot easier to pick something off the website of a major floral gift shop, but there's nothing like having something that's designed with your own personality in mind.\n\nEven as the flower business is dominated by major players and high-end floral designers, a small but growing number of independent florists have appeared in the market, each offering a unique spin on flower arrangement. They're hard to find, though, given that they're such tiny outfits. Most don't even have a website, but the web-savvy will be able to find them through their Facebook or Instagram accounts.\n\nAmy Yap is one such florist. You can find the owner of One Olive on her social media account one_olive, or at her shop in Tiong Bahru. A majority of her clients ask for bespoke bouquets and table arrangements, she says. \"Clients share with me the recipient's details, such as what flowers they like, and then I personalise the bouquet with the right colours and textures.\" With bespoke bouquets, more exotic flowers such as proteas, pincushions and scabiosas can be used.\n\nMarketing director Maria Lee, is one who's sold on bespoke flowers. She used to choose her mother's birthday bouquet from an existing selection at her florist. But no more. \"My mum loves pink and white flowers, and she created a bouquet using a mix of pink and white hydrangeas,\" says Ms Lee. \"The bouquet is so much prettier and mum knows that it was specially created for her.\"\n\nEnjoying all the creativity\n\nYilian Ng\n\nwww.facebook.com/yilianng\n\ninstagram.com/yilianng\n\nYILIAN Ng spends her working hours putting together a fashion magazine. At night, and on the weekends, she is putting together flowers. The fashion news editor for the local edition of an international fashion title runs a floral business on the side, and she gets a real kick out of doing both.\n\n\"Completing an issue of a monthly magazine is immensely satisfying, especially when you know how much there is to do to just get an article completed,\" says Ms Ng, 31. \"With flowers, it is very fulfilling to know you have made someone's day.\"\n\nShe began dabbling in the floral business earlier this year. Her extended family has been in the flower wholesale business for the last 30 years, and \"I've been playing with flowers since my primary school days, so going into the floral business is a natural progression\".\n\nShe describes her style of arrangement as \"a bit of wild foliage touch to tightly packed arrangements. I'm generous with the quantity of flowers because I like the way they look when they are packed together. There is a lot more statement and impact aesthetically.\"\n\nNearly half of her clients are corporate clients who want flowers for their events or VIPs. She does a mix of both hand and table arrangements. \"Both have different challenges but table arrangements are actually easier because they provide a base for you to work with while hand bouquets have to be perfected while the entire arrangement is in your hand, which can be quite literally a handful,\" quips Ms Ng. She charges from S$135 for a hand bouquet and from S$155 for a table arrangement.\n\nSome of her favourite blooms include David Austin roses because of their sweet scent, lavender, peonies and hydrangeas. \"Most florists shy away from chrysanthemum balls but I love using them because of their symmetry and they are fun to look at and are very lasting,\" she says.\n\nWhile clients indicate their colour and flower preferences, they give Ms Ng free creative rein when it comes to arranging. \"I love the arts, fashion and design so I'm sure my interest in these areas have influenced my floral designs one way or another,\" she points out.\n\nRecently, a client wanted her to create an arrangement that was inspired by fashion so she picked out a Chanel Fall/Winter 2014 look and created an arrangement influenced by it.\n\nMs Ng confesses that she has never had any formal lessons nor attended workshops in floral arranging. \"I just enjoy putting stuff together, just like my day job. It is ironic now that I conduct a monthly floral workshop at The Beauty Candy Apothecary in Cluny Court,\" she says.\n\nDespite Ms Ng's belief that she can make a better living by going into the floral business full-time, she has no plans to do that. \"Right now, I'm still enjoying all the creativity I get in both my day job and as a florist. I think when you are a truly creative person, you'll want these sources to be present at all times so you can continuously be stimulated and inspired. It's a very pleasurable feeling, to be inspired and creative on most days.\"\n\nVintage and rustic feel\n\nFlower Girl\n\nwww.flowergirl.com.sg\n\nBIRTHDAYS, anniversaries, weddings . . . these are just some occasions when people order flowers. For Catherine Strickland, one of the funniest reasons a client ordered flowers from her was \"an apology for getting drunk and spoiling book club\", quips the founder of Flower Girl.\n\nThe granddaughter of a floral artist, Ms Strickland was regularly doing floral arrangements voluntarily for her children's school chapel, friends and charity functions. \"I noticed a real demand for my relaxed natural style using Australian natives and European blooms. It was then that I decided to open the business formally,\" she says, adding that she has a family love for flowers, as it is something that she has grown up with.\n\n\"I studied design for many years, and worked in interior design firms. Flowers, design, your home - they are all linked,\" she says. \"I undertook floristry training, and now spend my time using beautiful flowers to complement designs of private homes and events.\"\n\nShe has both private and corporate clients, and her orders range from hand bouquets to large arrangements for private homes and cocktails and dinner party events. A hand bouquet starts from S$90. Ms Strickland also gets requests to create fascinators for ladies attending the Australian Melbourne Cup lunches.\n\n\"My style is loose, natural with a vintage and rustic feel,\" says Ms Strickland. Paying tribute to her roots, she uses Australian native flowers, \"for their exciting shapes, textures and longevity in the tropical heat\". Some of her favourite blooms include Lucedendron, Kangaroo paws, Pincushions, and Queen and King Proteas.\n\nClients can choose an existing range of arrangements from her website, or get bespoke bouquets. It can be as simple as having \"a little bit of blue for a baby boy or Mum's favourite hydrangeas, and I'll come up with a bespoke bouquet\", she says.\n\nShe also offers floristry workshops, but what's also popular is her \"Little Flower Girl\" parties, for girls aged seven to 13, where they learn the basics of floristry and make their own floral headpieces.\n\n\"There is great satisfaction in creating something unique - and even more satisfaction seeing faces of the recipients or attendees of an event when it looks so beautiful. I feel very privileged to hear so many messages of love, thanks, kindness and joy that accompany a bouquet,\" says Ms Strickland.\n\nUncompromised beauty and style\n\nHu.ey\n\nwww.facebook.com/hu.eyblooms\n\ninstagram.com/hu.ey\n\nJASMINE Chan considers herself her toughest customer. When she creates a floral bouquet, not only must it be tailored to the recipient, it has to be a bouquet that Ms Chan herself is happy to receive. \"This, to me, is what makes flower arrangement fun,\" she says. \"How do I make an all-pink bouquet not cloyingly sweet, because I am not such a person? Or how do I make a bouquet that I would like out of red roses, a flower which I am not fond of?\"\n\nA lawyer by day, Ms Chan's venture into floristry was borne out of a hobby of playing with flowers and gifting bouquets to friends and family. She toyed with the idea of marketing and selling her bouquets, and started Hu.ey this year. Hu.ey is colloquial speak for flowers.\n\nMs Chan, 28, picked up floral arranging skills from workshops. \"Beyond this, the entire process of putting together an arrangement has been self-taught. Knowing what works in a bouquet is essentially an exercise of style and aesthetics, so it's the process of creating various arrangements that has taught me the real lessons,\" she says.\n\nOf course, it helps that clients typically start by letting her know the recipient's personality, such as whether they are fiery or ladylike. Ms Chan describes her bouquets as unconventional yet arresting. \"Unconventional as there may be unexpected combinations of colours and textures. At the same time, I do not think that beauty and style should be compromised. So even though they're not conventional, they get your attention with their style and elegance.\" A hand bouquet costs from S$80.\n\n\"I get my inspiration from the flowers available in the nurseries, and select blooms for my bouquet from there. The spontaneity of working with whatever is available each day helps ensure that all my bouquets are unique, and adds to the creative process,\" she says.\n\nShe spends about an hour at the nursery each time, just picking out flowers, which is why she limits herself to a few orders each weekend. \"This gives me a lot of freedom to work with individuals and have fun with their ideas,\" she adds.\n\nHer latest challenge is making arrangements for men. \"I have received queries, and am hoping to come up with something that even the male species would be happy to receive,\" she says.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\n@TaySuanChiangBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its cost-to-revenue ratio was 45.3 per cent, up from 43.8 per cent in the last financial year.\n\nThe company's chief executive Nash Benjamin said: \"The fourth quarter was the worst we've seen in decades. We faced pressures on all fronts, with falling demand and rising costs.\"\n\nOverall, turnover in the group's fashion business rose 5 per cent to S$275.2 million; its timepiece business fell 16 per cent to S$92.1 million.\n\nA fair-value loss of S$1.5 million for the group's investment in St James Holdings Ltd and impairment of fixed assets of non-performing stores of S$1.4 million also contributed to the total loss.\n\nFor the year, loss per share was 3.89 cents. The board has recommended a first and final dividend of 0.25 cent per share, to be paid out on Nov 19.\n\nThe group announced that its business in Singapore, its largest market, was hampered by slower tourist arrivals. The depreciation of rupiah had made shopping more expensive for Indonesians.\n\nThe MH370 incident in March also dampened tourist arrivals and spending, which depressed demand for the group's portfolio brands in the fourth quarter. In the first five months of 2014, tourist arrivals from China, the second biggest source market for Singapore, fell 27 per cent.\n\nThe group announced that by the end of FY2015, its number of stores in Singapore would be cut back to 35 from the current 40. It will instead focus on expanding to the large, growing markets of Indonesia and Malaysia, raising the number of stores from the current 185 to 202 by FY2015; of the 17 new stores, 16 will be in Indonesia.\n\nIndonesia held up well, with domestic sales there rising by 13 per cent and gross margin remaining constant; however, the depreciation in the rupiah led to a negative share of result from associate of $1.7 million.\n\nFull-year revenues for Hong Kong, China and Taiwan, where the group operates a timepiece distribution business, were also down - in Hong Kong by 33 per cent, in China by 43 per cent and in Taiwan, 45 per cent. This was contributed by the loss of sales from Girard Perregaux, following the expiry of the distribution agreement in February.\n\nMr Benjamin said: \"Looking ahead, we don't expect a meaningful upturn in sentiment and consumer spending in the near to medium term.\"\n\nBut the company believes that its strategy of expanding in Malaysia and Indonesia, and strengthening its brand portfolio in the region will improve operating results.\n\nFJ Benjamin's shares last closed at 19.3 cents on Thursday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Zenith Media is the Malaysian unit of global media group Zenith Worldwide while IMG Worldwide creates and manages events, organisations and people in sports, fashion and the media.\n\nMedia Prime is a listed Malaysian media conglomerate that owns, among others, the NST Press Holdings and various free to air television stations that include TV3, TV8 and TV9. Telekom Malaysia is the country's national telecommunications carrier that also, through its broadband services, offers Internet-protocol television.\n\nThe FAM sanctions competitions like the Super and Premier leagues, the FA Cup and the Malaysia Cup, and Astro, which is listed on the local stock exchange and controlled by billionaire T Ananda Krishnan, has had the exclusive television rights for the past four years. That right, for which Astro had been paying around RM40 million a year to the FAM according to industry officials, expires at the end of the year, which explains the interest shown by the three contending parties.\n\nThat anyone would be interested in the local football league speaks volumes about the fascination and keen interest ordinary Malaysians display for the sport. Malaysia's latest ranking in the Fifa (Federation Internationale de Football Association) is a lowly 155th but that has hardly dampened the interest in the local league.\n\nIndeed, matches are normally sold out within an hour of sale openings - the FAM gets to keep 10 per cent of gate collections. More recently, merchandising - caps, badges, even mufflers in equatorial Malaysia - has become increasingly important in increasing revenues.\n\nStandout statistic: on average, 1.7 to 2 million Malaysians watch Malaysia-league football matches. In comparison, an English Premier Cup game, also exclusively aired by Astro, attracts 400,000 to 600,000 viewers, according to industry officials.\n\nIt is that viewership - and its potential advertisement spinoffs - for Malaysian football that the contending parties are interested in.\n\n\"You can slice and dice it in a number of ways,\" an industry official told BT. \"And with merchandising, it gets better.\"\n\nWhether the quality of sport itself will improve, however, is anyone's guess.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Considering Singapore's ageing population, his message would have caught the attention of many.\n\nAs a country, we've done well over the past 49 years. Progress since Independence has brought different challenges. One is the widening income gap. Success attracts skills and wealth which keep us growing. And our safe and clean city is a favourite choice for many foreigners to come here to live or invest.\n\nThe rising cost of living is a fair complaint - but that comes with an open, competitive economy that encourages high skills, talent and matching wages. This, however, makes it difficult for the older generation and the less capable to retire gracefully. Many are less educated, earning low salaries, and unable to move into more skilled jobs that pay well.\n\nThe government has recognised this and come up with the Pioneer Generation Package and MediShield Life.\n\nAt the Rally, PM Lee also announced extending the lease buyback scheme to four-room HDB flats. Putting on the hat of a financial planner, he spent some time on the challenges of retirement.\n\nThe rise in living costs and a widening income gap are here to stay as we progress to developed-nation status. Well-educated, highly skilled people earn high salaries, and the rich can leverage on their wealth to create even more wealth.\n\nThis will continue to affect a section of society, especially those who are less capable. As a caring society, we should alleviate their burden.\n\nThe Central Provident Fund (CPF) and retirement costs have been in the limelight recently. Some people have proposed that the amount available for housing be reduced to allow for more funds in later years.\n\nThis idea has its merits but funds drawn down for property need to be paid back with interest when the property is sold - in effect making it a form of investment.\n\nStill, property investment is cyclical and much influenced by market forces. Reducing the quantum of finance available for housing makes for fewer options on where to live but also lower risks if prices fall.\n\nInflation\n\nWhether housing is an effective hedge against inflation depends on global peace and our nation's continued progress.\n\nAnother argument is for the government to issue inflation- linked bonds.\n\nThis may look like an attractive option but does not directly benefit the poor unless we place investment and trading restrictions on them. Both would have the effect of reducing liquidity.\n\nThe biggest challenge is how to consistently generate returns that beat inflation. The amount of funds can be very large if there are no restrictions and we add existing CPF balances to it. When returns fall below the moving average interest rate, underwriting the shortfall will impact our Budget allocations.\n\nSome argue for higher interest on CPF balances. CPF is already paying more than double the rate of the 10-year SGS bond yield on the first S$60,000 in our accounts. Another group argues for more liberalisation for members to invest their CPF funds. This option is perhaps viable for a minority of members who are well educated and able to absorb losses. Returns are proportional to risks and, in practice, many members may not be able to do better. I have a colleague with an MBA who lost money during the Lehman Brothers crisis!\n\nAny effort to make retirement more comfortable for lower-income and less capable Singaporeans must be simple, sustainable, and place responsibility on the individual.\n\nOne suggestion is a National Savings Plan open only to low-income earners. It can also offer fixed deposit options with attractive returns for savers to think long-term.\n\nThe maximum amounts saved can be capped at a reasonable figure. Both savings schemes can pay interest above what the banks pay and act as a good savings complement to the CPF.\n\nAnnual income can be verified through the IRAS database. Full-time housewives and aged parents may also benefit as relatives place funds in their names.\n\nTo make it more equitable, the interest rates can be tiered on a sliding scale to benefit the really poor and elderly.\n\nWhile not quite like inflation-linked bonds, the purpose would be the same, without the onerous promise to match the inflation rate. It would offer better returns in simple banking terms to those in the lower stratum of society.\n\nThrift and saving for the future should be encouraged - particularly among lower-income Singaporeans, to help them retire more comfortably and with greater peace of mind.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Not even the popularity of \"Boardwalk Empire\", the historical drama series on HBO, could stem the decline of the big-casino tourist attractions along the shoreline.\n\nRevel's closing adds to a growing pile of empty gambling, hotel and resort space that the city will be left with when two other casinos close, as scheduled, by the end of September.\n\nIn addition to 127,000 square feet of gambling space abandoned at Revel, there is nearly as much at the adjacent Showboat casino-hotel, which is scheduled for closing at the end of this month. And then there is 87,000 square feet at the Trump Plaza, which is scheduled to shut on Sept 16.\n\nTogether with 75,000 square feet that was left vacant when the Atlantic Club shut in January, the closings total 413,700 square feet of gambling space, or almost a third of the city's total, according to the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, a state agency that uses gambling revenue for investment projects.\n\nInternet gambling, which became legal in New Jersey last year, so far has not been a significant threat to the casinos. After initially forecasting that online betting could increase industry revenue by US$1.2 billion in the first year, state officials sharply revised down forecasts for both revenue and expected tax receipts, which were scaled back to US$34 million from US$180 million.\n\n\"It hasn't come close to what their projections were,\" said Anthony Graziano, executive director in the Coastal New Jersey office of Integra Realty Resources, a national real estate valuation firm.\n\nCompetition from out of state, especially in Pennsylvania, has been the main threat to Atlantic City, overshadowing any issues from the recession or Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Customers in eastern Pennsylvania now have a choice of gambling halls in Philadelphia, Bethlehem, Chester or Valley Forge, removing the need to drive an hour or more out of state.\n\nWith Atlantic City gambling revenue in free fall, government and industry officials are turning their attention to how or whether the vast empty gambling halls, and thousands of hotel rooms that support them, might be reused. Revenue at the city's 11 operating casinos dropped 6.6 per cent in July compared with a year ago.\n\nIdeas for reuse include hotels and condominiums, non-gambling resorts, teaching space for local colleges, entertainment venues and \"boutique\" casinos that offer limited gambling in spaces that are smaller than the large floors that characterise the current generation of properties.\n\n\"The one-size-fits-all gaming-floor model is not working,\" said Curtis Bashaw, co-managing partner at Cape Advisors, a real estate developer, and a former head of the development authority. \"It was slot-driven, and slots have been encroached upon all around the market.\"\n\nMr Bashaw, who owns a boutique hotel in Atlantic City, argued that the younger customers sought by the city are less interested in \"pulling levers\" on slot machines than in social forms of gambling that involve more intimate environments.\n\nThe city could also build on its history as a traditional resort town that offered beaches, restaurants and entertainment long before gambling was legalised there in 1978, Mr Bashaw said.\n\n\"There's a middle path here,\" he said. \"If Atlantic City leverages its resort roots, and looks at gaming not as a commodity where people are bused in, thrown on to a floor, herded into a buffet, and thrown back on to the bus, it can work.\"\n\nOthers contended that purpose-built casinos are not easily remade, and so should be demolished or revived with new capital.\n\n\"Casinos are not great conversions to other uses,\" said Paul Steelman, principal of Steelman Partners, a Las Vegas-based architecture firm for the entertainment industry. \"They are custom-designed buildings that are very expensive to operate and maintain.\"\n\nMr Steelman said he knew of no successful conversion of a large resort casino anywhere in the world.\n\nHe said Trump Plaza should be demolished but Revel and Showboat should be bought by a major gambling corporation and reopened as casinos. Together, they would anchor one of three distinct casino districts within Atlantic City, allowing Revel to overcome criticism that it has failed to attract enough customers in part because it is isolated at the northern end of the city's boardwalk.\n\nRevel has filed for bankruptcy twice since opening in 2012. In July, its revenue plunged 36 per cent from a year earlier, the biggest decline of any Atlantic City casino, according to the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement.\n\nThe Revel, a US$2.4 billion building with a 47-storey hotel tower and a complex of wavelike lower floors, has also been criticised for a vertiginous series of escalators leading to the reception desk at the top of an 11-storey atrium.\n\n\"Having the lobby on the 11th floor makes no sense,\" said Gus Sotiriou, 56, a customer who was paying just US$69 a night for his recent stay. \"You're going up 11 storeys on three escalators with no guard rails.\" But he predicted that the building would find a buyer that would correct its design problems. \"Somebody will buy it, and make it like it's supposed to be,\" said Mr Sotiriou, a pension consultant from New Hyde Park, New York.\n\nJohn Palmieri, executive director of the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, expressed hope that Revel would reopen as a casino, and that Showboat and Trump Plaza could be redone for some other role.\n\n\"I would like to think that in the coming months, Revel will find a buyer, and that Showboat and Trump Plaza will find uses,\" Mr Palmieri said. \"It's not as though the casinos have built facilities that can't be repurposed.\"\n\nHe cited the Claridge, a former casino whose gambling floor is now being used as a performing arts centre.\n\nTwo weeks before Revel's scheduled closing, vacationers were sunning themselves on an 11th-floor pool deck lavishly planted with grasses and shrubs to resemble a natural shoreline.\n\nEric Pastuy, 42, a sales manager with an office technology company, said he had stayed at the Revel several times because of its good service and modern amenities.\n\nMr Pastuy, from West Milford, New Jersey, attributed the shutdown in part to Revel's failure to offer poker, a game that he said would have attracted a younger clientele, and said it already had a reputation as a place where gamblers found it hard to win.\n\n\"This wasn't known for being a hotel where you could make a lot of money,\" he said. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM", "images": []}

However, the state's economic architect is still courting the Republic for more investments in six key sectors.\n\nAccording to Amit Mitra, the West Bengal Minister of Finance, Commerce and Industries, a total of 13 letters of intent (LOI) and commercial contracts were signed yesterday on the fourth day of the West Bengal delegation's visit to Singapore.\n\nLed by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, the delegation of 12 West Bengal government officials and 52 business leaders have been in Singapore since Monday on a five-day trip to court investors.\n\nDr Mitra revealed that GIC has committed to a US$32.5 million infrastructure investment through the private equity HDFC Property Fund in the Kolkata Riverside Development project.

Dr Mitra told The Business Timesthis is likely to lead to an estimated US$20 million deal to enhance port efficiency and automation in the state.\n\nDr Mitra also revealed that Sanderson Group of Australia, which has a holding company in Singapore, will be establishing a joint venture with Ravi Auto Group from Kolkata to set up a world class amusement park.\n\nIncluding the current and future value of all these deals, Dr Mitra expects their cumulative value to add up to about US$500 million.\n\nHowever, he noted that the state of West Bengal is still looking to tap Singapore for more investments. Specifically, he told BT, it is targeting investments in six key sectors - urban development, construction, infrastructure investments, tourism and hospitality, human resource development, and manufacturing.\n\nHe hopes this will be catalysed by the setting up of the West Bengal-Singapore Business Centre in Kolkata, which Ms Banerjee announced after her meeting with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong this week.\n\nBut the state is not just looking at Singapore as a source of investments but also as a gateway to the rest of the Asean region, particularly Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Thailand and the Philippines.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With freight rates still in the doldrums, the companies hope that their new effort at pooling ships will help them reduce operating costs.\n\nThe container shipper gave notice of the new, so-called 2M vessel sharing agreement to China's Ministry of Transport in July, Maersk China's managing director, Jens Eskelund, told reporters in a briefing in Shanghai on Wednesday.\n\nMr Eskelund said that unlike the earlier plan, known as P3, the 2M service did not need approval from the commerce ministry. The two partners were only required to file details of the deal with the transport ministry.\n\nThe Ministry of Commerce had said earlier that they rejected the P3 alliance because the three firms would have had more than 40 per cent of Asia-Europe and trans-Atlantic trade, crucial paths in the global trade of goods.\n\nDirector-general of the Commerce Ministry's anti-monopoly bureau, Shang Ming, said in an interview with China's state broadcaster last month that he was still worried the 2M alliance could erode the bargaining power of China's import-export firms against big shipping companies.\n\nMr Eskelund, though, said that the market share to be held by Maersk Line and MSC on the Asia-Europe route would be similar to what other shipping alliances held. \"Other alliances have been able to operate similar market shares to the ones that we will have on Asia-Europe,\" Mr Eskelund said.\n\nAnalysts said that 2M would give the shippers less than 30 per cent capacity share on the Asia-Europe shipping route.\n\nOther alliances operating on the Asia-Europe route include G6 - made up of six shippers including Neptune Orient Lines and Nippon Yusen KK.\n\nThe CKYHE alliance - made up of shipping companies from China, Taiwan and South Korea - also operates on the route. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

However, if it fails to secure waivers or other reliefs and is unable to obtain funds from other sources, Jasper Investments anticipates that the liquidity obligation will be breached by the end of this month and the interest payment obligation will be breached in late November.\n\nIn the event of a breach of obligations, the bonds will be declared to be in default, and the Jasper Explorer vessel would probably be realised at a significant discount to its FY2014 audited net book value of US$358 million.\n\nThe board also highlighted that it might potentially breach the payment obligation for the converted Jasper Cosmopolitan Vessel, which will in turn trigger a cross-default under the terms and conditions of the bonds.\n\nIt is anticipated that Jasper Cosmopolitan Pte Ltd will not be able to raise sufficient funds to take delivery of the vessel by Aug 31. In such an event, YiuLian Dockyards (Shekou) Limited will be entitled to sell the vessel to recover the amounts owed.\n\nThe company's controlling shareholder, Morton Bay (Holdings) Pte Ltd, has expressed its intention not to provide further financial support of the group's financial obligations.\n\nJasper shares were last traded at 2.8 cents apiece.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's created a whole new class of travellers.\"\n\nAmong Awas's biggest customers are Singapore Airlines Ltd and Qantas Airways Ltd, owners of the low-cost Scoot and Jetstar brands, together with Malaysia's AirAsia Bhd and PT Lion Mentari Airlines of Indonesia, Asia's leading discount operators.\n\nThe Irish company mainly buys used jets from other lessors and plans to increase acquisitions of such aircraft \"significantly\" at the start of next year, Mr Sisson said. It has more than 300 planes in service with in excess of 110 operators.\n\n\"We tend to focus on having smaller exposures spread around the globe,\" Mr Sisson said. \"There's something inherently valuable in a diverse customer base.\"\n\nAwas's assets of more than US$11 billion are expected to increase to US$16 billion in 2016, Mr Sisson said. At least 45 per cent of its aircraft will be operated in Asia by the end of next year, compared with 41 per cent now.\n\nLow-cost carriers in the region account for about 20 per cent of seat capacity there, versus 2 per cent 10 years ago, Mr Sisson said. About 10 more new budget airlines are expected to start this year, adding to 47 already in operation, he said.\n\nMr Sisson said that he's open to partnering Chinese companies as they begin to seek opportunities overseas. \"We will be very interested and actively seek to work with these Chinese lessors to help them go abroad,\" he said. \"Awas has the ability to be a partner to them that doesn't actually create competitive tension because we're really set up to be a clearing house for other lessors. Many Chinese lessors specialise in brand-new aircraft.\"\n\nAwas has asked for second-round bids for about 100 of its newer aircraft on sale for as much as US$5 billion, people familiar with the matter said earlier this month.\n\nAsia's richest man Li Ka-shing is seeking to buy some of the planes in what would be the billionaire's first major investment in aircraft leasing, his Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd said on Aug 4. Mr Sisson declined to comment on the sale.\n\nSMBC Aviation Capital Ltd and Hong Kong Aviation Capital Co are also among bidders for aircraft being sold by Awas, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. A number of other lessors in the region have indicated ambitions for expansion.\n\nChina Aircraft Leasing Group Holdings Ltd last month became the first Asian player to publicly list. While reliant on China for most of its business, the company said that it is looking to increase business abroad.\n\nHong Kong Aviation Capital Co, the lessor whose shareholders include China's HNA Group, ordered 70 Airbus Group NV planes worth US$7.7 billion last month. China's Avic Capital Co, the financing arm of Aviation Industry Corp of China, said last week that it's in talks with \"relevant parties\" to buy Dublin-based aircraft-lessor Avolon Holdings Ltd.\n\nAwas is studying options for a sale or initial public offering as its private-equity owners consider an exit, Mr Sisson said in May. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

He stressed that the services provided were real, not \"mindless\".\n\nIn another e-mail dated Aug 7, 2007, co-accused Serina Wee had proposed how the Xtron bonds could be drafted.\n\nMr Ong said the flow of funds described the execution of a plan - similar to the projections the court was shown earlier - under which advance rental paid to Xtron from the church was used to cover the costs of producing Ms Ho's album in the United States.\n\nSeparately, the church bought S$13 million in Xtron bonds, with part of this money going towards paying Unusual Productions, which leased Singapore Expo to the church.\n\nKong said he did not know whether this was carried out, and added that if he had been aware of this, he would have asked Wee to seek the opinion of lawyers and auditors to address Xtron's needs.\n\nThe six church leaders are being accused of misusing the church's building fund monies to boost Ms Ho's singing career. Four of them also face allegations that they round-tripped monies through Xtron and glassware manufacturer, Firna, via sham bond investments.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The work itself is inspired by Gabriel Prokofiev, a London-based composer who is the grandson of the late and great classical composer Sergei Prokofiev.\n\nCaniporali says: \"I was inspired first and foremost by Gabriel's music, and used all of these dance forms and melded them into my own style.

The baby Porsche, together with the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class, are currently stoking interest in the market here, and both are doing it with their smallest engines. The Macan 2.0 is the first time in a while that a Porsche has a four-cylinder engine under the hood and which also happens to be inline (the last was the Porsche 968 from the early 1990s).\n\nThis is actually the same engine as the one found in the cheaper Volkswagen Golf R but with slightly less maximum power and torque, although the Porsche achieves both earlier than the Golf (both brands are part of the Volkswagen Group).\n\nAs a result, the Macan's torque of 350 Nm is available from just 1,500 rpm, thus making this compact SUV extremely responsive despite the small displacement. Mated to a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission instead of the Golf R's six-speeder, the all-wheel-drive Macan also has a wider spread of ratios.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Four of the six face additional charges of round-tripping monies through the two firms to cover up the misuse.\n\nTo add on to his point, Mr Ong referred the court to an e-mail dated May 2, 2006, from American album producer Justin Herz who asked Kong to transfer additional funds to the US for the Crossover Project there. The project aimed to reach out to non-believers through Ms Ho's secular music.\n\nFour minutes into receiving Mr Herz's request, Kong said that he would wire another US$250,000 by the next day.\n\nMr Ong then questioned the involvement of the Xtron directors, given that Kong has maintained that the directors were the final approvers of these matters.\n\n\"Where is the involvement of the Xtron directors? Your Honour, they were the signatories. If they don't sign, the money will not be sent,\" explained Kong.\n\nAnother point brought up by the prosecution - that accounting firm Advante - set up by co-accused Serina Wee, was part of Kong's plan to hide the fact that the six church leaders were channelling church monies through Xtron to fund the Crossover Project.\n\nWee had said in a July 2007 e-mail to co-accused Tan Ye Peng that she came up with the plan for a new accounting firm, Advante. She added that it would handle the accounts of church-linked entities including Xtron, Attributes Pte Ltd and Urban Entertainment Pte Ltd.\n\nSo Mr Ong put it to Kong that the set-up of Advante was \"really intended to create separation\" between the church and related entities, \"as well as to create separation, even between those organisations\".\n\nBut Kong disagreed. He said that the move was \"to better service\" some of those organisations. He dismissed Mr Ong's claim that there was something \"sinister\" and maintained that the bond investments were \"legal and legitimate\", that the bond proceeds were channelled into the Crossover Project and that the church benefited as a result.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By MELVIN YONG\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Aug 21, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nCOMPANIES need to fundamentally shift their thinking about risk management and use it as a strategy to spur their growth objectives, say experts.\n\n\"Risk management should not be viewed as a compliance tool to satisfy regulatory, disclosure or reporting requirements,\" said Neo Sing Swee, a partner with EY, who advises the professional services firm's clients in risk management practices.\n\n\"This gives the perception of having to deal with overwhelming mundane risk reporting activities with little or no linkage to business operations or performance.\"\n\nRather, an expanded risk management approach should be seen as something that can bring opportunities for companies to grow and improve their performance.\n\n\"If successfully integrated and understood, risk management can and should be an enabler to expansion strategies - providing the agility and confidence to move forward through well-defined risk appetite and the necessary checks and balances through risk review, escalation and monitoring,\" said Irving Low, partner and head of risk consulting at KPMG Singapore.\n\nCritics of an expanded risk management regime have long complained that companies, especially smaller ones, are overwhelmed by the amount of work required for managing risks that they do not enjoy any benefits from such investment.\n\nIn two recent studies, however, EY found that companies with more mature risk management practices generated the highest growth in revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA).\n\nAnd companies in the top 20 per cent risk maturity generated three times the level of EBITDA as those in the bottom 20 per cent.\n\nBut recent KPMG studies show that many Singapore-listed companies are still challenged in determining what and how much to disclose on their risk management processes.\n\nIn an April 2014 study, KPMG found that 31 per cent of all queries issued by the stockmarket regulator related to risk management and internal control disclosures.\n\nOf those queries, 29 per cent did not disclose the \"effectiveness\" of risk management and internal control systems, and 29 per cent failed to even mention \"risk management systems\".\n\nStrong risk culture a must\n\nExperts suggest that having a strong risk culture and robust governance, risk and compliance system in place is essential.\n\nThis should be driven by the right tone from the top, establishing clear roles and responsibilities and empowerment, investing in competencies and capabilities, and integrating risk management into existing processes so that it is not a standalone exercise.\n\nObservers also say before organisations start implementing any risk management activities or framework, they should first ask: \"Why are we doing this?\"\n\n\"If they are just ticking the box because the law or rules say so, then clearly the intention to do it is misplaced,\" said Mr Low of KPMG.\n\n\"Confidence in the organisation will be lost, and to kick-start would require much more effort than the first attempt,\" he added.\n\nCompanies should also actively find the balance between effective risk management and business expansion, noted EY's Mr Neo.\n\nFor instance, they can develop a risk-enabled performance management programme that involves integrating risk management into the rhythm of the business.\n\nThis means risk management is within the flow of strategic and business planning, operations, oversight and monitoring that runs from the board to line management.\n\n\"Companies should require that risks and the uncertainties that drive them are tied directly to business objectives, quantified to identify a realistic range of potential outcomes, and used to challenge or validate the assumptions that go into analysis and solutions,\" suggested Mr Neo.\n\nThere are several practical ways for organisations to assess how much risk coverage they need as well as to optimise their risk management coverage.\n\nIn a risk-enabled view of the business, EY suggests organisations will need to ask:\n\nThe answers will provide a good view of the company's risk profile, such as how the types, levels and potential impact of the aggregate risk exposures are represented in the organisations' current plans, said EY.\n\n\"This allows the actual risk and reward levels to become clearer, and management is able to see the uncertainties and challenges inherent in its choices and investments. This is often a breakthrough moment,\" said Mr Neo.\n\nKPMG advises its clients that in coming up with an effective risk management framework, organisations will need to establish their risk parameters or risk boundaries.\n\nThis sets limits and defines what are considered to be low- and high-risk events. These risk parameters are both quantifiable (such as financial risks) and non-quantifiable or qualitative (such as the impact on reputation).\n\nOnce these are defined by management and approved by the board, risks can then be identified and assessed consistently, based on the clearly defined risk parameters.\n\n\"This simple approach will help organisations focus on risks which are assessed to be high, rather than all other risks,\" said KPMG's Mr Low.\n\n\"As economic resources are limited, the allocation of such resources should be diverted only to those areas that are more deserving and clearly to those which have a higher impact on the organisation and which may prevent it from achieving its strategic or business objectives,\" he added.\n\nThe writer is general manager - Singapore, CPA Australia\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A year ago, it did not pay out any dividend.\n\nLooking ahead, Raffles said it continues to see positive outcomes from implementing new \"transformational strategies\" in China, where its college revenue is stabilising.

Much like the society it depicts, the film - directed by Phillip Noyce, written by Michael Mitnick and Robert B Weide and based on the novel of the same name by Lois Lowry - is depressingly bland.\n\nThe pristine community in The Giver has risen from the ashes of some unnamed war and is so devoid of character that it is depicted in black and white. That's because everyone - including teenagers and firm friends Jonas (Brenton Thwaites), Asher (Cameron Monaghan) and Fiona (Odeya Rush) - has a plain vanilla view of life. That's the world they were born into, and that's the way the elders want it. Anyone who can't live up to the standards set by the Elders is \"released\" to a placed called Elsewhere.\n\nThe Chief Elder (Meryl Streep) presides over an annual ceremony where young graduates are assigned specific roles in society. Fiona is tagged to be a nurturer (babies are given to pre-determined parents), Asher is to become a drone pilot (the Community's borders must be protected) and Jonas has been selected to be a Receiver - the person charged with keeping the Community's memories.\n\nNo one else has memories of any kind - mandatory daily injections erase them - so Jonas has to train with the incumbent receiver of memories (Jeff Bridges), a sagely type who lives on the edge of town and mumbles to himself a lot. As Jonas learns the history of the world from the Giver, he sees colours, feels emotion and even dreams of Fiona for the first time.\n\nNaturally, he now sees the Elders in a different light and begins resisting their ideas in favour of more radical thinking - like passing on the ability to have warm and fuzzy feelings to others. For personal reasons, the Giver encourages the subversive behaviour and points Jonas towards an outer boundary at the far reaches of the Community. Breach that, and he will free everyone's memories.\n\nScience fiction with a social studies bent is a favoured tool for bashing audiences over the head. The message is simple and straightforward: don't try to change the social order because nothing good ever comes of it. In taking the conformist view, The Giver doesn't come close to being different or creating boundaries of its own. Instead of standing out from the crowd, it's just one more entry in a sea of sameness.\n\nRating:\n\nC\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

When he got up, he was greeted by the sight of strange figures in black jumpers and bulbous wigs.

You'll find the answer in Nikhil Chopra's 50-hour performance art piece, Give Me Blood and I Will Give You Freedom because it's the kind that separates the nominal art-goer from the serious enthusiast.\n\nBut it must be said those whose interest was piqued by the effort, and dropped by for even 30 minutes a day to catch this \"work-in-progress\" from Friday night to Sunday night (Aug 7-9), were immensely rewarded.\n\nChopra's work demanded only one's time, while it gave back much more in terms of a visceral experience. To witness his durational performance art piece was like stepping into the pages of a graphic novel, watching the story unfold before you - in painting, animation, light and sound, with one solo artist-performer as the main creator of this tale.\n\nNot a single word was spoken, but yet one saw and \"felt\" the narrative unfold, as paintings were layered on one another of World War II in Singapore and Malaya.\n\nChopra's work, commissioned by the Singapore International Arts Festival, entailed looking for where the artist's background intersected with Singapore, and it was in the historical event of the Indian National Army during World War II - an army mobilised by Indian Nationalist Subhas Chandra Bose to fight with the Japanese against the British in Singapore and Malaya.\n\nEssentially, the visual arts-trained performer painted on the white walls and the floor (covered with white paper) within a white 330 sqm room. But he wasn't only a mural artist. He married that with performance art as he put on the persona of three different characters for the duration. What really created the magic though were the image projections and animation on the walls.\n\nThe clock for Chopra started ticking at 7.05pm on Friday night, when he entered the white room, naked except for boxer shorts, and started painting himself white. An hour later, he mixed black ink, and painted a line across the four walls. He then put on the wig, dress and make-up to transform into \"Michelle\", which, from demeanour, belonged to the upper crust of society. For over an hour, she dined at leisure as the projection on the wall turned the room into a fancy Mughal-style restaurant with arches and elaborate mosaic, complete with the sound of dinner chatter and the clinking of cutlery and glasses.\n\nIf the first night's proceedings were heavy on performance art - with long sessions of silent posing and one moment of \"interaction\" when Michelle served wine-filled chocolates to everyone in the room - the action unfolded the next morning.\n\n\"Michelle\" did go to bed (on a mattress in the room) as part of the performance, and on Saturday, awoke to have breakfast, in the midst of a lush, tropical landscape. She set to work soon after, drawing over the projected landscape, sometimes as if tracing it and using it as a template. Sitting in this room, the scene complete with the sound of birds and the breeze, the mood was vastly different from the night before. The calm mood was underscored as well by the \"domesticated\" sight of a genteel lady, painting a landscape, en plein.\n\nThis time, viewers began to appreciate how Chopra had set the stage the night before, that slowly drew us into another world created inside a white box. By the early afternoon, low drones of one or two planes could be heard, and seen, as planes started flying across the landscape while \"she\" continued to paint .\n\nThe action was practically popping later on, as \"Michelle\" became \"Sipahi Seva Singh\", a soldier, with a deliberate costume change. In the animation, one plane became two, and then distant sounds of guns firing and muffled blasts, as \"Sipahi\" painted ominous clouds hanging heavy over the landscape on one side of the room. On another wall, he drew tanks and bomber planes, again, tracing their projections on the wall. Give Me Blood was very much about seeing the process of a story being told, through painting; and who the protagonist-painter was, held pregnant meaning.\n\nFrom Saturday to Sunday, the black ink-on-white-wall \"war scene\" took shape and got more menacing - along with the changing animation and light projections - as \"Sipahi\" also starting blackening the floor.\n\nAudience members - unfortunately, too few - who popped in and out during intervals were often wowed by the dramatic painting and colourful animation unfurling before them on the painted walls. In one unmistakable allusion to the Japanese flag, for example, the red rays of the sun emanated from a corner of the wall.\n\nIf you stayed on however for hours at a time, like I did, and saw Chopra in action, aided by the light and sound, then that's when one felt like Alice, fallen into a black hole and transported to another world. The narrative that Chopra painted and performed grew on you, and its impact was greater with the gradual build up.\n\nAs a performer, Chopra himself remained aloof and apart - he didn't talk nor make eye contact with the audience. So you felt a little invisible, like a fly on the wall, watching the whole proceedings.\n\nAs the performance wound down on Sunday, and the mood changed from destruction to its aftermath - cascading walls of black and then columns of green light streaming down from top to bottom of the walls, blurred faces projected onto the black paint as if caught behind bars - it became clear how Chopra had poetically and judiciously mapped out his entire performance.\n\nFor the finale, he methodically taped up the paper on the floor - the central part bounded by bicycle tyre tracks, and painted with a writhing mass of black swirls - creating the outline of a spider web. And the stage was now set for Chopra to change into that role of Kali, the black Hindu Goddess of Death, as he painted himself black all over and stayed in character till the end.\n\nGive me Blood and I Will Give You Freedom (the title based on Bose's rallying call) was performance art at a very accessible level, length of time notwithstanding, where one easily grasped the story and saw the method and process of art-making taking shape.\n\nKudos must also be given to his collaborators and the \"white box\" of the theatre space within 72-13, which was also a perfect stage for the work with its dramatic high-ceilinged volume, and enclosed space to facilitate the sense of that world which Chopra was creating.\n\nOrganisers too, it must be said, thoughtfully arranged for a pop-up cocktail bar outside, and even arranged for special set meals at the nearby Chop Suey - to \"ease\" the audience's journey with the artist.\n\nChopra was wonderfully restrained, and that made his narrative - drawn out in monochromatic message - even stronger. For three days and two nights, mural painting met animation art which made you feel caught in movie set, and the passing of 50 hours - once one breached the first night's performance - became of little consequence.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

SingTel owns 32.4 per cent of Bharti Airtel.\n\nIn a very detailed report last week, CIMB had reiterated its \"upbeat\" outlook on Bharti Airtel amid rising voice tariffs and its market share gains led by data in India. Voice tariffs are mobile service rates that a telco charges for calls.\n\nCIMB is expecting a 10 per cent Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) compound annual growth rate for Bharti Airtel from FY14 to FY17, bolstered also by growth in Nigeria which makes up about 36 per cent of its revenue.\n\nThis view was echoed by PhillipCapital analyst Colin Tan who wrote last week that he expects \"continued strong performance from (SingTel's) regional mobile associates, particularly Airtel, driven by increased customer base and higher mobile data revenue\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Now it is simply a matter of reflecting these policies in next fiscal year's budget.\"\n\nJuly's 3.9 per cent annual rise was roughly in line with a 3.8 per cent increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll. It followed a revised 1.9 per cent decline in the year to June.\n\nGrowth in exports was driven by increased shipments of cars to Europe, metal processing machinery and items such as liquid crystal displays, the data showed.\n\nJapan's exports have struggled with weak demand in Asia for much of this year and a growing shift in production overseas - which has disappointed officials in the BOJ and the government.\n\nEvidence that exports are finally starting to recover suggests the economy may rebound from a sales tax hike in April, which would ease pressure on policymakers to do more to support growth.\n\nExports to Asia, which account for more than half of Japan's total exports, rose 3.4 per cent in July from a year ago as automobile shipments grew, finance ministry data showed yesterday, marking the first increase in three months.\n\nExports to China, another important market for Japan, were up 2.6 per cent in July due to gains in shipments of metal processing equipment and car parts, the data showed.\n\nExports to the US rose an annual 2.1 per cent as Japan shipped more car parts.\n\nHowever, exports of cars to the US market tumbled 10.3 per cent from a year ago, the fourth straight month of declines, as Japanese companies shifted production to the US and other countries, a finance ministry official said.\n\n\"The data shows exports are recovering moderately as a trend, so external demand may offset some of the weakness in domestic demand ahead,\" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. \"But export growth is unlikely to accelerate much from here. Europe's economy lacks momentum and this will weigh on growth of Japan's big Asian export markets like China.\"\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe updated his economic growth strategy in June with a plan to lower the corporate tax rate and offer incentives in special economic zones to encourage companies to expand operations in Japan.\n\nJapan's imports rose 2.3 per cent in the year to July, compared with a median forecast for a 1.7 per cent annual decline, as energy imports grew. That brought the trade balance to a deficit of 964 billion yen (S$11.7 billion).\n\nThe economy shrank an annualised 6.8 per cent in April-June, its biggest slump since the March 2011 earthquake, stoking fears that consumer spending had weakened more than expected after the April sales tax hike.\n\nExports also fell in the second quarter, showing that both domestic and external demand weakened.\n\nEconomists expect Japan's gross domestic product to grow around 4 per cent on an annualised basis in the current quarter, but many policymakers say exports must increase to ensure the economy remains on track.\n\nThe BOJ, however, has warned that the relocation of factories offshore, particularly for making cars, means that Japan may not be able to ramp up exports at will. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

(where) designers (have) a platform to sell their wares and get monetary returns for their original work,\" says Ms Lu, who adds The Local People's market for the Singapore Night Festival is created with the same purpose of its online store - to promote homegrown products and designers.\n\nSimilarly, Ms Lek explains that Cafe Fest was born of her and Mr Tan's experience in organising events for their clients. \"We decided to start something for ourselves and go through the full process of conceptualising and executing an event in an industry that we're truly passionate about,\" says the 27-year-old, who adds that the birth of Cafe Fest was inspired by a magazine article about how cafe-hopping has become the new bar-hopping because new joints pop up every week in Singapore. \"Our vibrant cafe culture deserves an event like this (and) we wanted to create the ultimate cafe-hopping experience for consumers.\"\n\nLikewise, Creatory is set to be a double celebration of sorts as the event also coincides with The Ate Group's eighth birthday. Its executive director, Sharon Chong, notes that local artists are now more eager to show their works so there is a need for more homegrown festivals. Ms Lek believes that the support of government initiatives such as the Singapore Tourism Board's Kickstart Fund would further boost this uptrend and the momentum picked up from other successful events will allow the newer ones to flourish.\n\nPublic reception has been more than positive - Kranji Countryside Association (KCA) saw an overwhelming 4,000 turnout at its inaugural Farmer's Market festival in June; while the Singapore Night Festival's attendance swelled from 100,000 in 2008, its first year, to about half a million in 2013.\n\n\"For us now, it's not just about size anymore, it's also about keeping it exciting (because) Singaporeans have short attention spans,\" jokes Singapore Night Festival creative director Christie Chua, before adding on a more serious note that the event has brought a buzz to the Bugis-Bras Basah districts and increased the amount of nightlife in the area.\n\nThe positive public reception is integral in attracting participants to come onboard as Ms Chong has found with Creatory already pulling in over 60 partners - despite being an inaugural event - and taking up all eight floors of the building where the festival will be held.\n\nShe observes that Singaporeans are beginning to acknowledge the talent in their own backyard; just like how more local music acts are headlining and pulling in the crowd at the Singapore Night Festival. \"The festival-goers are thrilled; I think they want to see that it's not just overseas (acts) that can create such hype,\" confirms Ms Chua.\n\nJewellery maker Carolyn Kan, founder of her own label Carrie K, adds that she has seen a rise in number, diversity and quality of Singapore designers and artisans since creating Keepers: Singapore Design Collective festival, and running a five-month pop-up retail store in the heart of Orchard Road. Furthermore, a small but increasing number of them are starting to make in-roads internationally, she adds.\n\nKCA executive secretary Manda Foo says that participants should grab opportunities like these to showcase local roots because \"even foreigners participate, looking to discover a deeper layer of Singapore from mass consumerism\". The industry itself also stands to benefit because she feels it keeps planners on their toes to come up with new ideas and experiences for visitors.\n\nWith homegrown festivals looking set to be a win-win situation for everybody involved, Ms Chong sums things up by saying: \"It's a great way for Singapore talents to grow organically and attract larger audiences.\"\n\ngverano@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Nyamza's mother was herself a victim of a violent crime of rape and murder, and her tragedy, Nyamza notes, was being too ahead of her times. \"Her death shook my world to the core, and caused me to question gender stereotypes in society.\"\n\nCorrective rape is when men have raped lesbian women, and gay men, or transgenders, in the belief that this will \"cure\" them of their homosexuality.\n\nThe second piece in the double bill, Hatched, sounds autobiographic, mirroring Nyamza's evolution as an artist and her life. Her son, 14, joins her in this piece.\n\nAdebayo, meanwhile, started rapping in the streets as a 13-year-old. Her love for music and poetry led her to study drama at Goldsmiths College, which she hated, until she came across Augusto Boal's Theatre of Oppressed. \"That excited me, what theatre could do. I toured with them, and that was a huge influence in my life and theatre-making,\" says Adebayo.\n\nThat experience led to physical theatre which is part of double bill. With her strengths in text, Adebayo seems to have been the dramaturg for the double bill. I Stand Corrected, for instance, looks at this contradiction of what is \"correct\" behaviour. \"We realised that corrective rape isn't about sexuality, but gender and making the 'right kind of woman',\" she explains.\n\nThat exploration in the dance piece is infused with humour, as the narrative is based on a woman coming back from the dead and trying to find out how to behave \"correctly\" in the world.\n\n\"There is humour in the performance, and interaction; we've found a way to explore heavy subjects. Art can give a safe distance and reflect back in a way that feels accessible,\" she says. \"In London, for example, or other parts of the world where corrective rape isn't an issue, it still has raised all kinds of conversations about equality that hasn't been achieved yet.\"\n\nDouble Bill: 'I Stand Corrected/Hatched', will be held from Aug 28-30, at 72-13 Mohd Sultan Road. The mature theme is for those 18 years and above.\n\nTickets at $45 are available from Sistic\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Ships he captured allegedly include the South Korean supertanker Samho Dream, which was released after nine months in 2010 for a record US$9 million ransom.\n\nGarfanji is not the first Somali pirate commander to be arrested.\n\nLast year Mohamed Abdi Hassan, better known as \"Afweyne\" or \"Big Mouth\", was arrested by Belgian police after he landed at Brussels airport on charges of kidnapping and piracy. He was lured to Belgium in a sting operation, believing he was to take part in a film on piracy.\n\nPirate attacks off Somalia have been slashed in recent years, with international fleets patrolling the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean, as well as armed guards being posted aboard many vessels. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

Indeed, the country's political system seems prone to plunging into a crisis every now and then. Yet, for all the drama and excitement, things usually straighten out quickly.\n\nUnfortunately, the current tussle for power in Selangor - and it is nothing more than that - threatens to stretch out until November when the state legislative assembly is scheduled to meet next.\n\nEmbattled Menteri Besar Abdul Khalid Ibrahim has indicated that the loss of support of 30 members of the 56-seat chamber would not make a difference to his administration unless he loses a vote of confidence in the assembly. Clearly, he is fighting for time and hoping for some horse-trading to tilt the balance between supporters and opponents between now and November. This means that the imbroglio in Selangor may have consequences for the national economy.\n\nSelangor is the most industrialised state in the country and accounts for no less than 23 per cent of Malaysia's GDP. (Kuala Lumpur, which is under federal administration, accounts for another 15 per cent of GDP and, together, they form the Klang Valley industrial heartland of Malaysia.)\n\nThe state has enjoyed growth in excess of 7 per cent in the last few years and has been projected to grow 6 per cent this year. There is practically no unemployment. On the flip side, the region has suffered from a prolonged drought, which resulted in water rationing earlier this year.\n\nWater levels in its dams are still low. According to the Selangor Water Management Authority, the Sungai Selangor and Sungai Tinggi dams stood at around 32 per cent and 45 per cent capacity respectively last week.\n\nThe Sungai Selangor dam supplies water to meet the needs of more than 60 per cent of Klang Valley - with all that it implies for factories located in the region.\n\nRationing has been put off for the moment but there are some restrictions on water usage and further curbs are in the works. More importantly, the fate of a water agreement signed with the federal government to pipe in additional supplies is likely to hang in the balance until the political issues are settled. Then there was the proposal to build a new toll road system to ease the infamous traffic snarls in Klang Valley. That too will now have to be put off until the political situation becomes clear.\n\nMore significant than delayed government projects is the investment climate. Deputy Finance Minister Ahmad Maslan rightly expressed concern over the state's economic and investment climate. \"From the economic standpoint, we want Selangor's stability to return as it is important for investors,\" he said.\n\nCertainly, continued instability would have a far-reaching impact on the national economy. Parties in the dispute should put the nation's interests before their own.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Might they be stuck in an unusual and prolonged equilibrium, in which frustratingly slow economic growth is the norm?\n\nThese are the crucial questions addressed in a new e-book from the Center for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) that I would recommend to policymakers, academics and investors alike.\n\nIn 2009, when I was working at the investment company Pimco, my colleagues and I argued that economic growth in the West would fail to bounce back sharply, as it typically does after a crisis-induced downturn. Instead, Western economies would face unusually sluggish growth and persistently high unemployment. We called it the \"new normal\". The notion was initially dismissed by many as \"unrealistic\" and then as too \"fatalistic\".\n\nNow the idea is being reinforced in a major way under the moniker \"secular stagnation\" - brought to public awareness by the Harvard University economist Larry Summers.\n\nIn the book, the CEPR brings together respected economists from different schools of thought - including Prof Summers, Paul Krugman and Barry Eichengreen - to discuss the various possible explanations, which tend to involve three elements: structural headwinds from ageing populations, poor infrastructure, heavy debt burdens, slow productivity growth and inequality; demand that is poorly distributed around the world and, in many cases, inadequate as people channel money towards paying down debt instead of spending; and a \"sclerosis\" effect in the labour market as persistent unemployment erodes skills and youth joblessness threatens to create a lost generation.\n\nOne disturbing finding is that policy measures such as central-bank stimulus may be ineffective in simultaneously delivering high growth, robust job creation, price stability and financial soundness. As Prof Summers puts it, if the macroeconomic goals are attained: \"There is likely to be a price paid in terms of financial stability.\"\n\nGiven the enormous stakes for current and future generations, the book rightly argues that serious thinking should be devoted to developing alternative policies. These involve pro-growth initiatives such as investing in education and infrastructure - ideas that have broad support among economists but have been stymied by political dysfunction. A second part looks at more controversial proposals for economic rethinks and institutional revamps, such as increasing central banks' inflation targets or raising the retirement age.\n\nEven today, there are people who believe that Western economies are suffering just from flesh wounds. Others feel that the ongoing period of gradual healing will prove sufficient to achieve economic lift-off, supported by the steadfast policies of central banks. Only a minority believe that something more worrisome may be in play, which is why the CEPR's contribution is so important.\n\nHopefully, by demonstrating why new economic thinking is needed, the book will raise awareness and catalyse innovative analysis. In any case, the work is extremely relevant to markets, where much of today's pricing seems to assume that the old thinking is still valid. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nBRC Asia secures contracts for Changi Airport Terminal 5 project worth S$570 million\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:04 PM\n\nDollar-selling is becoming a bubble, which may burst, HSBC says\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:03 PM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM", "images": []}

Midtown is \"the hole in the doughnut\", where landlords are vulnerable to extended vacancies and rents that probably won't rise dramatically.\n\nThe area, traditionally the most prestigious and expensive US office market, has turned into one where landlords must market space aggressively, pour money into renovations and seek early lease renewals to retain tenants. The technology and media companies that have driven New York's leasing in recent years have clustered in midtown south, between Canal Street and 30th, or moved to lower Manhattan in search of cheaper rents.\n\nAt the end of June, 35 blocks of at least 150,000 square feet of contiguous space each were on the market in Midtown, compared with 31 available in mid-2009, according to Savills Studley. Vacancies may rise next year as tenants continue to consolidate, Keith DeCoster, the study's author, said in an e-mail.\n\nPublisher Time Inc is moving from the Time & Life Building on 50th Street to Brookfield Place in lower Manhattan, while Conde Nast Publications is relocating from 4 Times Square to 1 World Trade Center. Both buildings will need new tenants.\n\nFinancial companies are also heralding change. JPMorgan Chase & Co, the biggest US bank, is considering moving its headquarters at 270 Park Ave to the World Trade Center or the far west side, though no decision is imminent, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Citigroup Inc is relocating its main offices from 399 Park Ave to buildings it occupies on Greenwich Street in lower Manhattan.\n\nNew York tenants are opting for value over prestige, said Craig Lemle, a senior managing director at Savills Studley. About 54 per cent of the Manhattan office space available as of June 30 was considered Class A, the highest quality.\n\nUntil late 2012, that share had never exceeded 50 per cent in data going back to the beginning of 2000.\n\n\"There's enough supply in Midtown to keep a lid on rents for the foreseeable future,\" said Mr Cohen of Colliers.\n\nMidtown has 270 million square feet of office space, and about 57 per cent is considered Class A. In lower Manhattan, from the foot of the island to Canal Street, about 42 per cent of the 95 million square feet of offices are top-quality.\n\n\"Traditionally, the better spaces get rented first,\" Mr Lemle said in a phone interview. \"But in these days of managing costs, we're finding more and more tenants are looking for space that's, quote, a better deal, than for space with better views or more prestige or higher in buildings.\"\n\nOwners of older properties are competing for tenants amid Manhattan's biggest surge of office construction since the late 1980s. Downtown, more than two million square feet are unrented at 1 and 4 World Trade Center, and another two million square feet are available at 3 World Trade Center, now being built.\n\nNot all of Midtown is weighed down by large vacancies. The Plaza District, home to some of the country's highest office rents, \"remains the preferred location\" for private-equity and hedge-fund firms, which can afford the costs, according to Savills Studley.\n\nMost tenants shopping for space now aren't set on a particular location and are more interested in the building itself, according to Scott Rechler, chief executive officer of RXR Realty Corp.\n\n\"Historically, they'd say 'I want to be on Park Avenue,' or 'I want to be on Sixth Avenue,'\" he said. \"They're now willing to look at the whole spectrum of submarkets at what buildings specifically meet their needs.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM", "images": []}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/transport-logistics/action-ashore-needed-eradicate-piracy", "site_title": "Action ashore needed to eradicate piracy", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nAction ashore needed to eradicate piracy\n\nIncidents in S-E Asian waters show that menace is not restricted to West African region\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Aug 19, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nPIRACY has become a fact of life for the shipping industry, to the extent that it is now difficult to remember the time when piracy was almost unheard of. Actually, it was not really that long ago that piracy was almost exclusively something for the history books.\n\nNow, unfortunately, it most certainly is an issue in the 21st Century.\n\nThe shipping industry has treated piracy in the same way it faces up to every new challenge. It has found practical ways to carry on with the minimum disruption. It has no other choice but we need to be careful not to regard piracy as just another \"peril of the sea\". In the past it was virtually eradicated by robust action by governments. The same needs to happen again.\n\nAnd, just in case piracy is seen as something that happens off the coast of Africa, there is a growing problem in the seas close to Singapore.\n\nThe International Chamber of Commerce's International Maritime Bureau (IMB) has just produced its half yearly figures. It says that, globally, 116 incidents of piracy and armed robbery against ships were reported to its Kuala Lumpur-based Piracy Reporting Centre in the first six months of 2014, down on the 138 incidents for the corresponding period for 2013. This year, 10 vessels were hijacked, seven fired upon, 78 boarded and 21 vessels reported attempted attacks against their vessels. Two crew members were killed, 100 taken hostage and five were kidnapped from their vessels.\n\nIn a sense, that is the \"good news\". Overall piracy statistics show a decline. Actually, of course, it is intolerable that any ships at all are hijacked, let alone any seafarers killed.\n\nThere are, though, two items of really bad news. One is the awful situation off West Africa. The other is that more small tankers are being hijacked for their fuel in South-east Asian waters. Six such cases of coastal tankers being hijacked for their cargoes of diesel or gas oil have been reported since April, sparking fears of a new trend in pirate attacks in the area. Until then, the majority of attacks in this region had been on vessels, mainly at anchor, boarded for petty theft.\n\n\"The recent increase in the number of successful hijackings is a cause for concern,\" says IMB director Pottengal Mukundan. \"These serious attacks have so far targeted small coastal tankers. We advise these vessels to maintain strict anti-piracy measures in these waters, and to report all attacks and suspicious approaches by small craft,\" he adds.\n\nCaptain Mukundan's words are always measured and he does not go in for hyperbole. In the current circumstances, owners and parties involved in the tanker trades need to take his words as a very strong warning. There is no doubt that the authorities in the region are also cranking up their anti-piracy patrols.\n\nThen of course there is West Africa, where 23 incidents were reported to IMB in the first half of the year, with Nigeria accounting for 10 of these reports. Four vessels were hijacked, including a product tanker taken off Ghana in early June and under the control of suspected Nigerian pirates for a week.\n\nNoting that Gulf of Guinea piracy was particularly violent, Capt Mukundan gives an example of an incident in which one crew member was killed and another injured during a shoot-out with armed pirates when they boarded a vessel off the coast of Nigeria at the end of April. A further three vessels came under fire from Nigerian pirates during this period. It is thought that numerous incidents still go unreported in West African waters.\n\nSo the region is actually even more dangerous than it seems from the figures. Moreover, the use of armed guards, which has been one of the keys to keeping a lid on Somali pirate activity, appears to have been ruled out in West Africa, at least in Nigerian waters.\n\nBy contrast, the number of Somali pirate attacks continues to remain low with 10 incidents reported including three vessels fired upon. No vessels were boarded. However, Capt Mukundan warns, \"While we welcome the continued decline in the number of Somali incidents, the risk of piracy has not completely diminished. Ship masters are reminded to remain vigilant and apply the Best Management Practices guidelines.\"\n\nCreated by industry bodies with input from navies, the Best Management Practices assist masters in transiting the dangerous waters in the Gulf of Aden and off the coast of Somalia.

Chinese government officials showed up at the exhibition venue and forced the removal of the artist's work, as well as any mention of his name, from the entire exhibition.\n\nSingaporeans will soon be able to see what the fuss was all about when the China-banned work comes to the Mizuma Gallery at Gilman Barracks later this month.\n\nIt will be part of a group exhibition titled Beyond Stuff, alongside some of Ai's other works, as well as the works of four other Chinese contemporary artists - He Yunchang, Li Mingzhu, Xia Xing, and Zhao Zhao.\n\nMost of the art works will be on sale, and are priced between S$13,000 and S$350,000. Says the gallery's director Sueo Mizuma: \"This is the first time the public can see (Ai's) Untitled work, although now the meaning of it is already changed. The thing is, even though it was originally not political, it is now because they shut him down based on his past records. That makes the work very political.\"\n\nHe goes on to explain that while not every single one of Ai's works are critical of the Chinese government, the ones that are, have earned him a reputation as a political activist. One example is an artwork that Ai created in response to how thousands of children were killed by the collapse of schools after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.\n\n\"The artist made a commentary to say the government was supposed to pay attention to how the buildings were built, so the children wouldn't have died,\" says Mr Mizuma. \"The government took it quite seriously because they didn't like Ai Weiwei making such a public commentary on them.\"\n\nThe other four artists taking part in the same exhibition are also controversial in their own ways, according to Mr Mizuma.\n\nHe, for example, is a Chinese performance artist, whose work, One Meter of Democracy, involved a doctor cutting a metre-long line on his body - from his shoulder down past his knee - without any anaesthetic.\n\nWhen asked why he selected these controversial artists for his exhibition, Mr Mizuma explains, \"My gallery may be a commercial gallery, but sometimes we want an exhibition with a strong message, to show the artist's mind and soul. Plus, these are major artists and I feel they are important, so I wanted to introduce them to people.\"\n\nrachloi@sph.com.sg\n\n@RachelLoiBT\n\nBeyond Stuff runs at the Mizuma Gallery on 22 Lock Road from Aug 29 to Oct 5.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/diesel-cars-vogue-now", "site_title": "Diesel cars in vogue now", "publish_date": null, "content": "Diesel cars in vogue now\n\nFuel efficiency, lower pump prices and improved low-end torque also pull factors\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Aug 19, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] Carbon emissions-based vehicle scheme (CEVS) rebates and the COE recategorisation are fuelling the growth of diesel-engined cars, which has been rising even as the overall car population is slipping slowly.\n\nThe population of diesel-powered cars has been increasing by a minimum of 40 to 50 cars per month in 2013, but has since advanced to more than 100 in the last four months.\n\nAs at end-July 2014, there are 2,097 diesel passenger cars. Although this number is small compared to the 5,484 petrol-electric hybrid cars and the total population of 609,245 petrol-engined cars, it is significant as diesel cars used to be a rarity on Singapore roads.\n\nThat changed in recent years with the advances in engine technology and corresponding reductions in the diesel tax. As diesel engines became cleaner, the government cut the diesel surcharge progressively to 40 Singapore cents per cubic centimetre currently.\n\nBut the biggest boost to diesel was the CEVS, and the reclassification of COE Category A for small cars.\n\nCEVS was introduced in January 2013 to make green vehicles more attractive by offering ARF rebates of up to S$20,000 for low carbon emissions. At the same time, vehicles with high carbon emissions have to pay a registration surcharge of up to S$20,000.\n\nThen from February 2014, Cat A for cars under 1,600 cc was re-categorised to include an engine output limit of 130 hp. The aim was to keep luxury models out of this small car category and ensure the Cat A COE premium did not continue skyrocketing.\n\nTogether, the two measures helped to make diesel cars a price-competitive alternative. Diesel engines produce lower horsepower and exhaust emissions than petrol engines, so they qualify for cheaper Cat A COEs as well as higher CEVS rebates.\n\nThe growing popularity of diesels contrasts with its previous image as a pollutive fuel.\n\n\"By and large, diesel is an accepted technology as far as the Volvo brand is concerned,\" says Sabrina Sng, general manager of Volvo dealer Wearnes Automotive. \"It is no longer a major obstacle.\"\n\nVolvo's foray into diesel models was actually precipitated by the fact that its petrol models' high power rating pushed them out of Cat A. In order to continue offering Cat A cars, Wearnes imported diesel alternatives.\n\nToday, a Volvo V40 D2 with a 1.6 turbodiesel costs S$149,000 including COE, or about S$15,000 less than a V40 T4 with a 1.6 turbocharged petrol engine.\n\nThen there are the advantages, such as increased fuel efficiency, lower pump prices and improved low-end torque. Ms Sng says that all of this makes diesel a more compelling offer.\n\nWhile there are more hybrids than diesel cars, the population of the former is growing at a slower pace because CEVS benefits only small hybrids, making them more affordable than big hybrids with more expensive components that attract higher registration taxes due to the progressive ARF or additional registration fee structure.\n\nThe reason for the relatively large population of hybrids is the previous Green Vehicle Rebate scheme introduced in 2001. GVR gave a 40 per cent rebate on OMV or open market value. GVR was replaced by CEVS in 2013.\n\nAt Porsche, diesel models are doing better than their hybrid counterparts.\n\n\"The CEVS rebate may be substantial for a small Japanese hybrid but not for a S$500,000 Porsche Panamera hybrid,\" explains Jason Lim, general manager for Porsche dealer Stuttgart Auto. \"Whereas the price of a Cayenne diesel is more acceptable and you enjoy the drive because of the torque.\"\n\nThere is also less concern now driving across the Causeway because of the fuel quality there, according to Mr Lim. This is because Euro 5 diesel is now available at selected stations. He adds: \"Those who are more informed about diesel and have experienced it abroad because of travel or studies are able to accept this technology.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The new rule requires operators to contact the FAA before operating in the airspace.\n\nThe agency said the move was taken after \"updated assessment of risk\" and a lack of airlines wishing to fly in the airspace. \"The ongoing armed conflict and volatile security environment in Syria poses a serious potential threat to civil aviation,\" the FAA said.\n\nAirlines have been paying close attention to flight paths over conflict zones since Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was downed by a suspected surface-to-air missile last month while flying over eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russia separatists are fighting Ukrainian troops. Syria is in the middle of a civil war in which 170,000 people have been killed since 2011.\n\nThe FAA also said \"opposition elements\" had warned civilian airlines not to provide service to Syria. Armed extremist groups in the country are known to be equipped with anti-aircraft weapons that could threaten civil aircraft, the agency said.\n\nThe ban applies to all US-registered planes, commercial operators and FAA-licensed pilots. It makes an exception for flights operated with US government permission and US-registered aircraft operated by foreign carriers.\n\n\"Due to the presence of anti-aircraft weapons among the extremist groups and ongoing fighting in various locations throughout Syria, there is a continuing significant potential threat to civil aviation operating in Syrian airspace,\" the agency said.

Iswaran yesterday.\n\nThe minister, concurrently the Second Minister for Home Affairs and Trade and Industry, was at the opening of ST Electronics's new Satellite Systems Centre, a high-tech facility kitted out to support the full cycle of satellite design and development.\n\nThe S$60 million centre has a 1,000 sq m clean room for working with sensitive equipment. Up to two satellites can undergo assembly, integration and testing at any one time in the facility, which has laboratories for development work on areas such as satellite altitude control, intelligent power control and ground station infrastructure.\n\nWith the facility, ST Electronics is a step closer to its goal of launching TeLEOS-1, Singapore's first commercial Earth observation satellite, in Q4 next year.\n\nST Electronics has 23 years of experience as a supplier of ground-based satellite communication network and systems. The 400kg TeLEOS-1 marks its expansion into producing equipment for use in space, including satellite components and whole satellites.\n\nST Electronics also intends to sell the high resolution images taken by TeLEOS-1 as it orbits near the equator, where there are now far fewer satellites in orbit than at the planet's poles. The satellite's orbit, near the equator, takes it round Earth approximately once every 100 minutes.\n\nTeLEOS-1 will thus enjoy the advantage of having the highest revisit rate among satellites, which will pave the way for more up-to-date haze monitoring and maritime surveillance, among other applications.\n\nThe Singapore government has been keen on developing the space industry, which creates high-value jobs for PMETs (professionals, managers, engineers and technicians).\n\nTo that end, it set up the Office for Space Technology (OSTin) last year. This office comprises agencies such as the Economic Development Board (EDB) and various government ministries, which will grow the sector, using a S$90 million set aside for this purpose.\n\nMr Iswaran, noting the government interest in the industry for small satellites, said: \"Driven by growing Asian demand for satellite-enabled applications... small satellites are expected to become ubiquitous within the space industry.\"\n\nThe opening of the satellite centre is thus an important milestone for the industry. Kelvin Wong, the assistant managing director at EDB, said: \"As the first local commercial satellite design and manufacturing facility for small satellites, the centre will enable ST Electronics to leverage its competencies to develop and export new small satellite solutions to the world.\"\n\nST Electronics will continue to play a key role in driving the growth of the local satellite ecosystem. Already, it has trained and certified five small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as suppliers of space-qualified components.\n\nMr Iswaran said: \"Over time, this will allow our SMEs to break into the lucrative global-supply chain for space-qualified components.\"\n\nSingapore has stepped up the pace of launching satellites into space.

That's translating into a windfall for bond investors in the biggest airline in Brazil.\n\nIts US$500 million of notes have rallied since Aug 13, when Gol beat analysts' sales estimates for a fifth quarter and said a record 81.2 per cent of seats on its planes were occupied in June and July.\n\nThat's pushed returns on the Sao Paulo-based airline's bonds to 21 per cent this year, triple the average in emerging markets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nTwo years after laying off about 20 per cent of its workers and reducing flights by 15 per cent, Gol has narrowed net losses by more than half.\n\nMoody's Investors Service raised its outlook on Gol to positive this month, saying it may lift the company's rating from B3, the sixth-lowest junk rating.\n\n\"The company has been doing its homework and they're on a positive trend,\" Carlos Gribel, the head of fixed income at Andbanc Brokerage LLC, said by telephone from Miami.\n\nYields on Gol's US$300 million of notes due 2020, which have fallen to 8.5 per cent from a high of 14.3 per cent last September, may decrease one percentage point more if results continue to improve, according to Mr Gribel.\n\n\"The movement of the bonds reflects the improved outlook for the company,\" Gol chief financial officer Edmar Lopes said. \"It shows we're on a different level now.\"\n\nThe airline said its net loss shrank to 174 million reais (S$95.8 million) in the second quarter from 715 million in the same period two years ago. Revenue rose to 2.4 billion reais, beating analysts' estimate for 2.2 billion reais.\n\nThe company carried more passengers on its planes during the World Cup, when analysts were concerned that a drop in business travellers would leave more empty seats.\n\nCarlos Legaspy, who oversees about US$350 million in emerging-market debt at InSight Securities, said fuel costs are among the reasons he's shunning Gol's bonds.\n\nGol's costs increased 20 per cent in the second quarter from a year ago after a 13 per cent jump in fuel prices, a slump in the real and a pick-up in inflation.\n\n\"I stay away from the airlines,\" Mr Legaspy said. \"It's a confluence of a fairly elastic demand, a high percentage of fixed costs and a really volatile input, which is fuel. All of those things can conspire in a really bad squeeze.\"\n\nIn an Aug 7 report, Moody's said Gol has implemented \"significant capacity adjustments\" that balanced its revenue amid weaker economic growth in Brazil.\n\nLatin America's biggest economy will expand 0.8 per cent this year, versus 2.5 per cent in 2013, according to the median estimate from analysts in a central bank survey last week.- Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

The acquisition will expand its presence in the region.\n\nThe indirect acquisition of SDJ forms part of Geo's overall strategy to diversify and expand its range of production.\n\nIt will also help the group to enhance its product offering. SDJ, which spans a total area of 236.1 hectares, will contain coal with an average calorific value of 4,038 kcal/kg Gross As Received (GAR), comparatively higher than Geo's current BEK concession, which contains coal with an average calorific value of 3,470 kcal/kg (GAR).\n\nThis product enhancement is a significant move for the group, which has also targeted shifting its focus to include coal with calorific value ranging from 4,000 to 4,200 kcal/kg (GAR) as it opens up new markets for them.\n\nCoal of this range are highly versatile as it meets the requirements of power plants in India, China and Indonesia.\n\n\"With an increase in coal reserves of more than three-fold and a higher quality, we believe that this would be significantly positive to the group's future revenue,\" said Mark Zhou, Geo's chief investment officer. \"Increasing our coal reserve bank is akin to increasing land bank for property developers; this will help us with a solid reserve to be able to take advantage of future upswings in coal prices. Expansion strategy will also be on the diversification of our coal product mix so that Geo will be able to grow both as a international as well as a domestic supplier to the market.\"\n\nThe group also recently announced that it had entered into a mining services contracts and mining cooperation agreement with CV Mandiri Makmur Citra Tambang.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, it will provide mining services, comprising overburden removal, including land clearing and dewatering, in the concession, also in South Kalimantan, spanning an area of 190.7 hectares.\n\nGeo will also purchase the coal from the concession owner at US$35.35 per tonne, and has contracted for 1.9 million tonnes of coal with a calorific value of 4,100 kcal/kg (GAR).\n\nGeo shares, trading of which was halted yesterday, closed at 27 cents last Friday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Affin Investment said that, not only would the 30-per-cent limit reduce the growth prospects of the affected companies and hurt their valuations, those valuations would be further hit by the need to sell down.\n\nOne option for affected planters would be to look into merging with their Indonesian peers to reduce their equity stakes, although the Indonsian side would wield greater bargaining power under the circumstances.\n\nThe bill, which Indonesia's lawmakers are reportedly attempting to push through before president-elect Joko Widodo takes office, proposes to give affected companies five years to comply with the ruling.\n\nReuters reported that companies which fail to do so can be fined, temporarily suspended or have their licences revoked.\n\nA previous proposal by Indonesia to cap the land bank of foreign-owned planters in the country at 100,000 ha was less damaging to planters.\n\nWith the amount of land for oil palm cultivation shrinking in Malaysia over the years, many of the country's planters have sought land in Indonesia to expand their operations; more recently, some have headed to Africa.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Eight stocks out of these 30 largest and most liquid stocks on the Singapore Exchange were hit by at least two analyst downgrades each.\n\nThey are ComfortDelGro, Genting Singapore, Golden Agri-Resources, Hutchison Port Holdings Trust, SIA Engineering, StarHub, ST Engineering, and UOB Bank.\n\nThe downgrades came because of different reasons: poor earnings, slower than expected revenue growth, or a run-up in stock price.\n\nOCBC head of research Carmen Lee told The Business Times yesterday that companies that disappointed her included Noble Group, Olam International, Sembcorp Marine and Sembcorp Industries.\n\nBut the downgrades were more because of company or sector-specific reasons than a general downturn, she said. The three local banks did well and most property stocks also came in within expectations, she said.\n\nOne of the more dramatic downgrades in the earnings season came from Maybank Kim Eng Research's analyst Derrick Heng. He downgraded SIA Engineering from \"buy\" to \"sell\" and slashed his target price by 27 per cent from S$5.75 to S$4.20.\n\nThe aircraft maintenance and repair play had posted a 22.5 per cent reduction in quarterly net profit to S$53.5 million due to weak contributions from associates and joint ventures.\n\nIn a July 29 report, he noted that management had turned bearish on their outlook. \"Sinister signposts\" include a decline in heavy maintenance workload after a recent expansion in the Philippines and a persistent weakness in shop visits for Rolls-Royce engine shops, he said.\n\nThree other brokers also downgraded the stock to a \"sell\". SIA Engineering fell from around S$5 on July 28 to S$4.55 yesterday.\n\nTelco StarHub also experienced four downgrades from analysts who shifted their recommendations from \"buy\" to \"hold\".\n\nAmong them was Phillip Securities analyst Colin Tan, who said that lacklustre earnings, due to lower pre-paid mobile revenue and broadband price competition, were not expected to improve in the second half of the year. He lowered his price target from S$4.50 to S$4.30.\n\nSome analysts also downgraded UOB Bank to \"hold\" or \"sell\" after a run-up in price from as low as S$20 at the beginning of the year to S$24 by end-July. Quarterly net profits had missed average estimates and tighter regional liquidity is showing up in lower net interest margins, deteriorating asset quality and a lack of deposit growth, said JP Morgan analyst Harsh Wardhan Modi.\n\n\"These issues will likely persist, leading to lower quarterly earnings, at least for the rest of the year,\" he said as he downgraded the stock to \"underweight\" with a target price of S$22.\n\nOut of the three local banks, DBS remains most favoured by analysts due to its relatively cheaper valuations. It has 24 \"buy\" calls, three \"hold\" calls and no \"sell\" calls.\n\nDBS joins Keppel Corp and CapitaLand as the only three STI stocks with no \"sell\" calls.\n\nSaid Credit Suisse analyst Anand Swaminathan in a recent note: \"Q2 results bolster our view that DBS should have the best earnings momentum over the next few quarters ... UOB's outperformance could potentially reverse in the second half.\"\n\nMeanwhile, container port play Hutchison Port Holdings Trust saw a downgrade by AmFraser to \"hold\" given decreasing margins until the shipping industry turns around.\n\nAnd aerospace and defence conglomerate ST Engineering was downgraded by DBS Group Research to \"hold\" due to weak profitability especially in the marine and land systems segments. \"Overall group profit before tax margin of 10.3 per cent was the weakest since Q1 2011,\" analyst Suvro Sarkar said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They even informed the visitors that the Eratat subsidiary concerned was a good customer and did not have any loans with the bank.\n\nEratat's interim judicial manager Hamish Alexander Christie of restructuring specialist Borrelli Walsh disclosed the CBRC findings in an announcement on the Singapore Exchange yesterday. He is seeking legal advice and \"preparing further enquiries of the CBRC and/or application for a review of this opinion of CBRC in Fujian by the state CBRC\".\n\nThe news is likely to hit retail investors, who own about three quarters of the company. Eratat had a market valuation of almost S$50 million before trading was suspended in January.\n\nA subsidiary of well-known Hong Kong finance company Sun Hung Kai and Co has also lent 134 million yuan to Eratat last June in a bond issue.\n\nIt was the failure of Eratat to make a coupon payment of 4.2 million yuan last December that triggered this chain of events.\n\nEratat former CEO Lin Jiancheng had assured directors and the bondholder that the payment was coming and that Eratat had cash balances of 640 million yuan as at Jan 24. But he was unable to satisfactorily explain why the payment could not be made, audit committee chairman Lim Yeow Hua said in end-January.\n\nAs a result, the audit committee called for a trading halt in Eratat shares on Jan 27 and suspended the CEO from his duties.\n\nAuditors and directors then made an impromptu visit to ABC's branch in Jinjiang Chendai where they supposedly met ABC staff. They were subsequently stymied in their attempt to clarify inconsistencies on the purported Eratat subsidiary bank statement.\n\nEratat then approached ABC Bank's Beijing headquarters, which informed them that the Eratat subsidiary, HMW, only had a balance of 73,321.63 yuan (S$15,000) at end-2013.\n\nABC Beijing added that HMW also had bank borrowings of 34 million yuan as well as trade bills of 30 million yuan at end-2013.\n\nIn a May 30 announcement, Eratat said it lodged reports with CBRC and Singapore's Commercial Affairs Division. It was unable to raise funds to pay for a special audit. Interim CEO Ho Ker Chern, who was chief financial officer since 2007, also quit. The bondholder applied successfully to Singapore's High Court to appoint the interim judicial manager to manage Eratat's affairs to see if a better solution rather than a winding-up can be found.\n\nFor now, investors are left wondering how the investment community had got the company so wrong.\n\nEratat listed as a sports footwear company in 2008, reporting growing revenues and profits. But Eratat executive director Ye Sanzhi sold off his entire 6.77 per cent stake for S$4.44 million last August.\n\nLast November, Eratat was awarded runner-up in the \"Most Transparent Company Award 2013, Mainboard Small Caps Category\", by the Securities Investors Association of Singapore. The same month, with the company trading at about nine cents a share, Voyage Research had an \"increase exposure\" call on the company with a target price of 28 cents a share.\n\nEratat shares last changed hands in January at 10 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Ten per cent more could be lost from overall competition, McKinsey said.\n\nStill, opportunities abound, though less broad-based, for banks, with the bulk of potential gains - at about 30 per cent of profits - from cost savings, McKinsey said.

ECB president, Mario Draghi has already announced interest rate cuts and attractive loans to banks to encourage them to lend more money to businesses. But economists and the media want full scale QE to regenerate contracting and stagnant economies.\n\nIn particular they are fretting that EU sanctions against Russia and its counter sanctions against EU agricultural products, will drag economies downwards. Poor second-quarter economic results illustrate that business sentiment and direct investment in job creating factories, plant and equipment have deteriorated. Germany's GDP contracted by 0.2 per cent in the second quarter this year, France has experienced zero growth in the first and second quarters and Italy has been in recession in the first half of the year . All three countries are especially vulnerable to Russian sanctions and counter sanctions. Germany, in particular, is highly dependent on oil and gas flows from Russia and prices may rise in the northern hemisphere winter.\n\n\"Europe now needs full-blown QE,\" trumpeted the Financial Times. \"It is hard to imagine how much more evidence European policy makers need before conceding their eurozone growth plan is not working.\"\n\n\"Since the eurozone crisis began in 2010, the authorities have been consistently late to grasp the true nature of the issue and slow to respond,\" complained the FT. \"Their tardiness has caused unnecessary economic pain across much of the continent. This week's alarming new evidence that the eurozone is sliding towards deflation and stagnation must persuade governments and the ECB to get ahead of the problem once and for all.\"\n\nThe belief that QE is on the way, boosted European markets towards the end of last week, but markets fell from their peak on worries that Russian forces would help rebels in eastern Ukraine.\n\nCritics of QE such as Brendan Brown, head of Economic Research at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities International, maintain that QE at best would be a mere palliative. Mr Brown notes that despite extensive US Fed QE that economic recovery in the US has been relatively weak. Excess liquidity has poured into US and global financial assets.\n\nBut since business people have feared that stock market booms would falter and crash and lead to recession, they have refrained from boosting job creating capital investment, Mr Brown says. Moreover in Europe, the German Bundesbank, the nation's central bank, has so far opposed QE, according to currency strategists.\n\nMeanwhile, austerity policies aggravated by geo political events, notably the Ukraine crisis, the EU's Russian sanctions policy and fears about Iraq and Iran, are causing businesses to hold back on expansion and investment, economists say.\n\nThe ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment for Germany declined significantly in August for the eighth consecutive time and tumbled to its lowest level since December 2012.\n\nDr Frieder Mokinski of ZEW, Germany's Centre for Economic Research, said that ongoing geopolitical tensions had \"markedly reduced industrial production\". \"Incoming orders suggest markedly reduced investment activities on the part of German firms against the backdrop of uncertain sales prospects.\"\n\nInflation has also fallen sharply in the region and could decline further as Russia is banning food imports from the EU, thus causing a glut of produce within Europe. The fear is that falling prices will turn into a deflationary spiral, where consumers and businesses delay purchases because they expect prices to fall further. This in turn would cause companies to fail and unemployment to rise, leading to a further economic downturn.\n\nSince tax revenue would decline in those circumstances, government deficits would increase. The eurozone's massive debt burden would then worsen, leading to another euro crisis in the coming year or two, economists warn.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The group said in May that the glut this year would exceed the 714,000 tonnes in 2013 after it increased output estimates for Thailand, the biggest shipper.\n\nFutures plunged 28 per cent this year, declining to the lowest level in almost five years in June. Supply increased after record prices three years ago spurred output, while demand slowed as the pace of economic expansion decelerated in China, the biggest buyer.\n\nThe glut is now contracting as profits decrease for small farmers who represent 80 per cent of world supply amid forecasts for record global car sales.\n\n\"Small growers across producing regions have started responding to a consistent decline in prices,\" said Lekshmi Nair, senior economist at the group.\n\nFarmers are showing less enthusiasm for tapping while tyre demand is boosting usage, she said in the e-mail. The inter-governmental group has members from producing and consuming nations and industry.\n\nFutures in Tokyo, the global benchmark, plunged to a five- year low of 190.3 yen (US$1,858 a tonne) on June 5 after reaching a record 535.7 yen in February 2011.\n\nGlobal stockpiles are still expanding. Inventories will reach 3.79 million tonnes by the end of this year and 4.33 million tonnes by next year, according to The Rubber Economist Ltd. Reserves will increase to the equivalent of 3.9 months of consumption at the end of 2014 from 2.5 months a year earlier, the London-based independent researcher said by e-mail on Aug. 15.\n\n\"We don't expect to see an end of ample supply,\" Carsten Fritsch, an analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, said in an e-mail. \"Demand growth will find it hard to catch up. We do not see a major scope for prices to recover.\"\n\nWorld inventories were 2.9 million tonnes at the end of 2013 from 2.26 million tonnes a year earlier, study group data show.\n\n\"The continued decline in natural rubber prices and a slower-than-expected recovery in global demand as well as increased supply have led to an inventory buildup,\" Ms Nair said.\n\nProduction from growers representing 93 per cent of global output dropped 1.1 per cent to 5.83 million tonnes in the first seven months from a year earlier, the Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries said on Aug 6. The group represents the top producers including Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam.\n\nGlobal sales of light vehicles, weighing less than six tonnes, are set to climb 4 per cent to a record 90.5 million units next year, according to LMC Automotive Ltd, a research company in Oxford, England. Sales across Asia will expand 5.4 per cent in 2015, it said in e-mail.\n\nWorld production will rise 2 per cent to 12.275 million tonnes this year and increase to 12.635 million tonnes in 2015, the study group said. Demand will expand by 4.5 per cent to 11.904 million tonnes in 2014 and grow to 12.433 million tonnes next year. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nBRC Asia secures contracts for Changi Airport Terminal 5 project worth S$570 million\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:04 PM\n\nDollar-selling is becoming a bubble, which may burst, HSBC says\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:03 PM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM", "images": []}

The new centre is targeted for completion around 2020.\n\n\"It will be the jewel in Jurong,\" PM Lee said.\n\nTo improve traffic in the area, the Ayer-Rajah Expressway could be moved southwards to create more space next to the lake for lakeside housing.\n\nThe Jurong Lake District has also been proposed as a possible site for the terminus of the proposed high-speed rail line between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.\n\nSingapore had earlier considered Jurong East, Tuas West and the city centre as possible locations for the terminus and all three are still up for consideration; PM Lee's speech narrowed the Jurong East option to the Jurong Lake district.\n\nThe focus on the lake area of the district comes after the Jurong Gateway neighbourhood around the Jurong East MRT station had already experienced significant growth in the past few years with the opening of a number of malls.\n\nSingapore-listed CapitaMalls Asia operates the Westgate and JCube malls in the Gateway area, while Australia's Lend Lease runs JEM.\n\nBut the gardens and parks have not kept up with the shopping centres.\n\nPM Lee recalled that when he visited the Japanese and Chinese gardens in June, they looked the same as when he previously visited 30 years ago.\n\nThe number of visitors to those attractions also pale in comparison to other community parks such as the Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park.\n\n\"I felt we could do so much more with the gardens,\" PM Lee added.\n\nTerence Wong, head of research at DMG & Partners, said the speech \"puts the area under the spotlight\".\n\n\"Plans for improvement have been spoken of, but now it makes the details a little more concrete. It puts interest in the western part of Singapore,\" Mr Wong noted.\n\nHe said developers might now take a closer look at the area and be willing to pay more for sites, but prices in the short term are unlikely to change much, especially with improvement projects also expected elsewhere in Singapore.\n\n\"Many parts also have catalysts,\" Mr Wong added. \"Whether it's the north and closer ties with Malaysia, Tanjong Pagar with the waterways, or the east ... just about everywhere there's something going on.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Workers who prefer to go back to school should have that opportunity, but companies should also offer in-house improvement programmes for those who are more inclined towards on- the-job learning.\n\nRoland Ng, managing director of crane operator Tat Hong Holdings, said most of his workers are non-university graduates.\n\n\"We have to recognise that non-graduates can also play a part in our national evolution,\" he said.\n\nTat Hong, which operates in a highly technical industry, has found success working with polytechnic interns partly because the company exposes them to different aspects of the business, Mr Ng added.\n\n\"They have to get the students early exposure to companies, give them early internships so that they have a better understanding of what they can do,\" he said.\n\nSuccessful people share qualities, not qualifications, said Tay Poh Choo, spokeswoman for mail carrier Singapore Post, which employs about 5,000 people.\n\n\"The employee has to be self-motivated, tenacious, hard-working and committed - all ingredients that are necessary for anyone to succeed, with or without a university degree,\" she said.\n\nBut Ms Tay said a key challenge is making more appropriate funding available for upgrading.\n\nFor Courts' Mr O'Connor, PM Lee's message holds personal meaning. Mr O'Connor joined Courts 21 years ago with only O-level qualifications, and just last week was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Stirling.\n\n\"A remarkable achievement in itself, a university degree is not the be all and end all of a person's professional development, and paper qualifications should never be the sole defining benchmark for a successful career,\" Mr O'Connor said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/singapore-shipping-ports-products-and-plays", "site_title": "Singapore shipping - the ports, products and plays", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nSingapore shipping - the ports, products and plays\n\nGEOFF HOWIE explains the links between shipping, coal and iron ore derivatives on SGX\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Aug 17, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nAT ANY one time there are about a thousand vessels in the Singapore Port. Statistics show that every two to three minutes, a ship leaves or departs to, or from, 600 ports across 120 countries.\n\nShipping is a global business sensitive to the state and swings of the world economy. It connects ports and countries for many companies pursuing activities like importing raw materials and exporting to new consumer and wholesale markets.\n\nEconomic efficiency has become an important by-product of global trade. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) postulates that global trade provides for a more prosperous, peaceful and accountable economic world.\n\nTrade is also measured and gauged like economic growth. In the International Monetary Fund's World (IMF) Economic Outlook update released on July 24, world trade volume growth for 2014 was revised slightly downwards to 4 per cent, with the 2015 outlook remained unchanged at 5.3 per cent.\n\nNevertheless world trade growth remained in line to outstrip world economic growth, which is forecast to be at about 2 to 3 per cent this year.\n\nWhile most of the world's financial activities are facilitated through banks and exchanges, freight carriers facilitate most of the world's physical trade. The efficiency sought in physical trade has led to the development of supply chains using multiple countries, also referred to as value chains.\n\nHence, the process of importing and exporting has evolved into a multilateral activity, rather that a simple trade between two countries. The need for supply chain management, intermediate trade and transshipment have all played roles in Singapore becoming one of the busiest trade ports in the world. Another keynote statistic is that, annually, more than 120,000 ships call at Singapore.\n\nGlobal seaborne trade has become an important part of Singapore's economy, as have commodities, which together have helped to generate Singapore's trade hub status. Hence it is natural that commodity and freight markets have also become an important part of the products and services offered by Singapore Exchange (SGX).\n\nFreight rates and the price of shipping\n\nFreight rates refer to the price of transporting cargo from one place to another. More than 90 per cent of today's trade is transported by sea.\n\nSeaborne cargo is categorised into containerised, dry or wet cargo. The majority of the shipments across seas are in the form of containers which ferry mostly the finished products in large container vessels.\n\nHowever, the raw materials are shipped around from its origin to places where they are consumed and processed on dry bulk vessels or wet tankers.\n\nRaw materials that command the most weight on the seas are oil, iron ore, coal and grains.\n\nUltimately seaborne freight rates depend on the type of ship used, the distance to be travelled between ports and the weight of the cargo.\n\nFreight rates can also differ on the direction of the trip and season of the year. For example, during the grains season in South America, significant capacity of dry bulk vessels is locked in shipping grains from west to east over longer journeys. This results in sharply reduced supply for other commodities, leading to freight rate volatility.\n\nAmong the dry bulk segment, iron ore makes up more tonnage on the seas than grains because the world's biggest iron ore importer, China, is shipping in its iron ore from afar.\n\nApproximately 50 per cent of its imports come from Australia and 20 per cent comes from Brazil.\n\nThe most popular vessel used to ship iron ore is the Capesize, which can typically transport above 150,000 long tons of deadweight. Long tons of deadweight - abbreviated as DWT - are commonly used to explain the carrying capacity of a vessel.\n\nLarger Capesize ships that can carry up to 400,000 DWT are also known as Very Large Ore Carriers (VLOC) and are also available in the market to transport iron ore.\n\nTypically larger vessels are used to transport iron ore due to the greater economies of scale that can be achieved over lengthy times at sea.\n\nIt takes approximately six weeks for iron ore to be shipped from Brazil to China and approximately three weeks for it to be shipped from Australia to China.\n\nAn example of a freight rate would be US$7.77 per metric tonne for a capsize vessel to ship 160,000 metric tonnes of iron ore from Western Australia to Qingdao in China over a three week period.\n\nThis implies a cost of US$1.2 million for the journey. Like any other price, this freight rate fluctuates daily based on the fundamental forces of demand for and supply of such vessels.\n\nAssuming a miner intends to ship 160,000 tons of iron ore from Australia to China, they could consider hedging potential fluctuations in Capesize time charter rates.\n\nCommodity traders and participants hedge for a number of reasons. Key among them is when their costs are tied to the average rate for the month or when they have locked in a profit based on delivered price of the underlying commodity.\n\nIn the first scenario, hedging using freight derivatives based on time charter contracts neutralises the volatility. And for the second scenario, traders can protect their trade margins by converting a variable freight rate into a fixed freight rate using freight derivatives.\n\nFreight derivatives\n\nFreight derivatives are financial instruments based on a range of shipping routes. These products are used to manage freight rate risk and also to gain exposure to the freight market.\n\nThe Singapore Exchange (SGX) offers a suite of freight products comprising of freight futures and Forward Freight Agreements (FFA).\n\nAn FFA can be traded either for the transportation of a specified amount of commodity between ports (voyage) or for a specified time period of the voyage (time charter).\n\nThe difference between the contract price and the settlement price is multiplied by the cargo size or the voyage duration (expressed in terms of days) to determine the profit or loss from the contract.\n\nFor a specified time charter, the freight futures available are based on four different vessel sizes in descending order: Capesize, Panamax, Supramax and Handysize.\n\nFor the example discussed above, the miner could take a long position on the Dry Bulk Voyage FFA contract for the Capesize Route C5. The C5 route is Western Australia to Qingdao.\n\nOther popular routes that are available for this contract are Tubarao to Qingdao (C3) and Bolivar to Rotterdam (C7). As noted above, at the time of writing, the C5 contract is trading at US$7.77 per metric tonne. The miners can also choose from FFA contracts that are based on day rates or half-day rates, expressed in US dollars per day.\n\nIron ore\n\nIron ore is the most shipped commodity in the world after oil. Singapore has grown to be the main global trading centre for iron ore over the last five years.\n\nAn eclectic mix of global iron ore traders are based here.\n\nThese participants include about 30 Chinese steel companies, which make up about one-third of the approximately 100 metals and mining trading firms in Singapore, major iron ore miners and international traders.\n\nSGX was the first exchange in the world to offer clearing of OTC (over-the-counter) iron ore swaps. Currently, SGX offers trading and clearing of iron ore futures, swaps and options on swaps.\n\nSGX iron ore swap and futures contract specifications are similar in most aspects, except that the contract size for futures is one-fifth that of the swaps.\n\nIron ore is a fundamental raw material for the production of steel. In turn, steel is fundamental to multiple forms of infrastructure. China is the world's largest steel producer, rolling out approximately half of global output.\n\nRecently on June 16, the price of iron ore traded as low as US$89 per metric tonne. For the remainder of June, the price of iron ore then moderately recovered to end the month at US$94 per metric tonne.\n\nThis was amidst strong Chinese steel output and relatively lean mill inventory. SGX iron ore volumes in June reached 55.9 million metric tonnes with open interest averaging 55.8 million metric tonnes. Both monthly volume and open interest were more than double their levels for June 2013.\n\nThe majority of turnover conducted in the SGX iron ore swaps and futures contracts is from industry participants seeking a hedge.\n\nHowever, the dynamics of the commodity, in addition to the associated trading relationship, make iron ore and associated freight rates markets of interest to professional investors.\n\nThe prices of the iron ore futures are available on a delayed basis on the derivatives page under SGX Market Information on www.sgx.com.\n\nCommodity futures are categorised as Specified Investment Products due to their associated risks and more complicated nature than stocks.\n\nCoal\n\nCoal is also one of the world's most shipped commodities. In Asia Pacific, thermal coal is the primary source of power generation.\n\nIn China, 81 per cent of its power production is from thermal coal followed by Australia (69 per cent) and India (68 per cent), according to World Coal Association (WCA).\n\nIt is mined and converted to electricity domestically and also shipped for exporting to other countries. According to the WCA, of all the total thermal coal produced in 2012, approximately 84 per cent was absorbed domestically while the remaining 16 per cent was shipped for exports.\n\nHence, like iron ore, coal needs to be shipped across the globe, mostly from Indonesia, Australia and South Africa to China, India, Japan and Europe.\n\nHow coal is transported to where it will be used depends on the distance to be travelled, according to the WCA. Short distance coal transportation is generally carried out by conveyor belts or trucks, or trains and barges for longer distances within domestic markets.\n\nAlternatively coal can be mixed with water to form coal slurry and transported through a pipeline.\n\nShips are commonly used for international transportation, in sizes ranging from Handysize, Panamax and Capesize.\n\nUnlike thermal coal which is used to generate energy, metallurgical coal or coking coal is used to produce steel.\n\nWhile Indonesia has overtaken Australia as the world's biggest export of thermal coal, Australia maintains its position as the world's biggest exporter of coking coal.\n\nBecause of the different grades of thermal coal and coking coal, the latter trades at a premium to the former. Currently coking coal trades at US$119.20 per metric tonne versus US$ 65.65 per metric tonne for thermal coal.\n\nBoth numbers refer to the delivered price in August 2014 of the material on a CFR (cost and freight) basis into China.\n\nNew thermal coal products (based on South African and Australian coal price markers) and coking coal derivatives (based on China and Australian coal price indices) have commenced trading on August 4. The prices of the coal futures are available on a delayed basis on SGX's market information page under derivatives.\n\nThe writer is SGX's market strategist\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

As part of the move to introduce more flexibility into the system, he announced that the government would allow those aged 65 and above to take out a portion of their CPF savings in a lump sum.\n\nHe stressed that it wasn't a decision that was taken lightly, and rightly so. Those who choose to exercise this option will have to cope with less in their accounts for their retirement needs, at a time when more people are expected to live longer and the cost of living is going up.\n\nWhile people should have a right to access their CPF savings, which is their own money, they should at least be given some help in making an informed decision. The CPF Board and other relevant stakeholders could perhaps ensure that members, especially those who are not financially savvy, get all the necessary information and counselling well in advance of making big withdrawals. Ultimately, of course, the final decision rests on the CPF members themselves and how they would like to utilise their money, be it to go on a vacation, fulfil some other lifelong dream or pay for a family emergency, although one hopes that they would use it wisely and not squander it away.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has reviewed its rules and determined that AirPooler Inc and Flytenow Inc, which connect pilots with passengers willing to split fuel costs and other travel expenses, are not operating legally.\n\nThe decisionis a barrier to extending the so-called sharing economy into air travel. Car-hailing service Uber and room-rental firm Airbnb have faced similar legal hurdles as traditional industry competitors - and the legacy rules that apply to them - confront technological changes in the way customers seek to use and pay for day-to-day services. AirPooler CEO Steve Lewis said: \"It's much more than a fad for the shared economy because you have all these assets around that are being underutilised.\"\n\nInvestors including Goldman Sachs Group and Google Ventures are pouring cash into the market for sharing apps, including those that let users order taxis and cars or share rides. Uber raised US$1.2 billion in funding in June, giving it a value of US$17 billion. Airbnb was valued at about US$10 billion after its last round of fundraising.\n\nIn the AirPooler case, the FAA's legal interpretation rejects the idea that the air-travel service simply amounts to cost-sharing rather than a commercial aviation operation. The service is equivalent to charter flights and would require additional licenses and regulatory oversight, the FAA said in an Aug 13 letter to a lawyer for AirPooler.\n\nThe pilots orfirm may face FAA enforcement action if they continue. AirPooler will ask the FAA to reconsider the decision and will study ways of adjusting the service to make it legal within existing regulations, Mr Lewis said.Both companies plan to continue discussions with the FAA to see whether there is a way for the business model to operate within the agency's regulations. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/early-augs-downward-trend-could-resume", "site_title": "Early Aug's downward trend could resume", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nEarly Aug's downward trend could resume\n\nThis week may be stormy as odds are reset on likely date of Fed rate increase\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Aug 17, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nLAST week, shares rebounded somewhat from the August doldrums as a lull on several fronts allowed investors to focus on US growth prospects.\n\nThis week promises to be a stormy one, however, as traders reset odds on the anticipated date of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate increase.\n\nThe ceasefire in Israel and an agreement to allow a Russian humanitarian convoy into Ukrainian separatist areas represented tentative diplomatic progress in the eyes of traders last week. Stocks dipped and oil prices spiked on Friday when Ukraine said it destroyed some Russian military vehicles in a contretemps with the aid convoy. The US, meanwhile, was flirting with another ground force landing in Iraq.\n\nFrom a cold economic perspective, such conflicts touch American lives mostly in the form of higher petrol prices. Last week, prices of energy commodities were flat to down as traders focused on the glut in supplies produced by extensive \"fracking\" in the US.\n\n\"The conflicts in Russia and the Middle East continue to be regional - they have not impacted natural gas or oil prices from a supply perspective,\" said Oliver Pursche, president of money manager Gary Goldberg Financial Services.\n\nThe main reason Mr Pursche is optimistic that the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 can finish the year at a record high is his conviction that the bloom has returned to the US economy. Not only was second-quarter economic growth of 4 per cent higher than almost anyone expected but the details of the report also made the pace look sustainable.\n\n\"You didn't see business inventories being overly high and that's very important because it shows that the second-quarter business activity wasn't simply inventory restocking - there was more to it than that,\" explained Mr Pursche.\n\nA booming economy has a downside for a stock investor. A boom soon leads to inflation and inflation soon leads to a rate hike. That will not only hurt spending by consumers and businesses by increasing borrowing costs. The Fed is still gradually weaning markets from \"quantitative easing\", the bond purchases designed to keep interest rates down. But the central bank would have to move more quickly if prices started spiralling higher.\n\nSome investors are not sure the stock market is even ready for the end of Fed stimulus yet. For most of the past five years, the Fed has supported markets with some form of rate-cutting stimulus. Every time former chairman Ben Bernanke removed these props, stock and bond markets collapsed. The economic environment may be a little more favourable this time around, but stocks could sell off in October when the current programme tapers off to nothing.\n\nFor now, most analysts believe the Fed will pull off the \"tapering\" gambit and that the post-financial crisis era of monetary stimulus will end without a stock-market crash. One brokerage summed up the central preoccupation of the collective mind of Wall Street last week in one word: \"When?\", Credit Suisse's analysts wrote, in a note to clients. \"Our economists' view is that the Fed will raise rates in the third quarter of 2015 (versus a market view of June 2015).\"\n\nStill, the Credit Suisse analysts said the Fed could move sooner if the second-quarter economic growth pace holds.\n\n\"Job openings, National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) surveys, CEO confidence and fiscal policy are all consistent with 3 per cent plus GDP growth, with the additional boost of improving bank-lending intentions and (a reduction in private-sector debt),\" they added.\n\nThis week, analysts anticipate another relatively strong reading from the NAHB homebuilder survey and an increase in used-home sales. For stocks to build on last week's gains , the actual data will have to hew close to the estimates. Anything too hot or cold could make traders lose their appetite for stocks, being almost as afraid of a boom as they are of a bust.\n\nMacy's launched the retailers' quarterly reporting season, which comes a month after the rest of the sectors, on a sour note, as the department store cut its fiscal 2014 projection for sales open a year or more. That adds to other mounting concerns in the retail sector after several luxury stores hinted they had been forced to cut prices to entice shoppers.\n\nAnother reason the downward trend of early August could resume relates to the laws of probability.\n\n\"We've now gone 34 months without a 10 per cent correction,\" said Ryan Detrick, a technical analyst for investment research website See It Market. \"This is one of the longest stretches ever without a 10 per cent correction and it has many traders on edge.\"\n\nThe August sell-off could easily mushroom into an official 10 per cent correction, according to one strategist. But it's hard to see it go much further, he added.\n\nWhile there are may things for investors to worry about \"we believe that a softening of US earnings-per share and GDP growth projections are not among them,\" said Sam Stovall, equity strategist at S&P's Capital IQ. \"We, therefore, continue to advise that dips be bought, as declines of less than 20 per cent have historically taken an average of only four months to get back to breakeven.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Nearly 6,000 new commercial jets, worth US$780 billion, are expected to be delivered over the next 20 years, according to aircraft maker Boeing Co.\n\n\"Local companies have been expanding quickly and the growth potential is huge,\" Mark Jiang, managing director of aviation finance at ICBC Financial, told Reuters. ICBC Financial is backed by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd, while Bank of China Ltd and other state lenders support other lessors.\n\nICBC, which signed a US$1.1 billion deal with Embraer SA for 20 E190-E2 jets during Chinese president Xi Jinping's visit to Brazil in July, owns and manages 384 planes, up from 60 planes three years ago, according to Mr Jiang.\n\nEven though International Lease Finance Corp, part of AerCap Holdings NV, and Gecas, a unit of General Electric, still dominate the market, local lessors led by ICBC and CDB Leasing, backed by China Development Bank, have managed to win over a big chunk of new business in recent years.\n\nCollectively, Chinese lessors now handle 80 per cent of all new domestic leasing business, up from next to zero five years ago, said Mr Jiang.

What opportunities for Singapore businesses would there be?\n\nPublished Sun, Aug 17, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nMax Loh\n\nCountry Managing Partner\n\nErnst & Young LLP\n\nTHE outlook for the Indonesian economy remains positive with consumer confidence generally high, core inflation below 5 per cent and the rupiah showing some recent strength. The Jokowi administration looks set to build on this through a pragmatic and pro-business approach and via key reforms. The immediate challenge is the current account deficit, which is expected to increase due to low coal prices, the implemented ban on certain mineral ore exports and high oil imports. Sustainable cuts in fuel subsidy will provide the incoming government with more scope to increase spending on services and infrastructure.\n\nThe key lies in enhancing GDP growth in the medium term through speeding up structural reforms. The incoming administration's economic priorities and focus on infrastructure improvements, public services, law enforcement and labour relations should bring more business opportunities for foreign investors and Singapore businesses, particularly in the consumer, oil and gas, automotive and transportation, healthcare and media sectors.\n\nYeoh Oon Jin\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nPwC Singapore\n\nJOKOWI is seen by many as a business-friendly leader who will take a pragmatic approach to introduce economic reforms. Known as one of the more visionary and successful leaders in recent Indonesian political history, he has a good track record of implementing constructive changes as a governor. This bodes well for Indonesia's ambition to become a developed country by 2025.\n\nIt will take time for Mr Joko to work through the traditional power structures but businesses will welcome this move in the right direction. Singapore businesses can certainly contribute to Indonesia's development strategies in infrastructure and consumer-related sectors to tap into a large, rapidly growing middle class.\n\nLow Lee Yong\n\nCEO\n\nMHC Asia Group Pte Ltd\n\nTHE sleepy giant has awakened. Joko Widodo's win shows that the Indonesian people has awoken with a new and open mindset. They are ready to bring about change in their country. Under the Jokowi administration, we expect economic reforms to be made. But as his track record shows, we can also be confident of a stable business environment while reforms are being implemented. These are key factors for businesses to thrive.\n\nIn the healthcare sector, Indonesia has launched its universal healthcare insurance programme, BPJS. This is a mega project covering about 250 million people. Most importantly, we see the will of the administration to carry this through. For MHC, we have already partnered with Siloam Hospitals of the Lippo Group to link up providers in Indonesia. This is exciting as it brings about many opportunities for us to tap on.\n\nGeorge Chang\n\nVice-President\n\nSoutheast Asia & Hong Kong\n\nFortinet\n\nWHEN Joko Widodo was finally named the winner of the general election, the sense of relief from the business community was palpable. Pro-business and industrious, he had an unrivalled track record of success in running Jakarta. His electoral win was a feather in the cap of other good news emerging from Indonesia recently - successful cutting of fuel subsidies that will return the economy to health, growth of the country's realised foreign direct investments by 16.9 per cent in the second quarter, and Indonesia's rise to become the second fastest growing G-20 economy after China.\n\nWe in the IT industry are optimistic. A vibrant business environment is the first step to greater technology investment, which will in turn further boost business outcomes. Many opportunities exist for Singapore and international companies, as local firms look for competent overseas partners to meet the demands of a fast-growing middle class. Judging from the way Jokowi ran Jakarta - cutting red tape, promoting business and constantly looking for ways to over-achieve - we are confident that Indonesia will take on a sheen not seen in a while.\n\nJames Tay\n\nCEO\n\nLogicalis Asia\n\nINDONESIA's prospects have never looked better. A stable and pro-business Jokowi government would augur well for Singapore companies and MNCs investing into the country. Jokowi, with his background as the mayor of Solo, will continue his predecessors' push for development of the regions beyond Jakarta.\n\nThis geographic expansion will fuel a massive growth for the tech sector as businesses invest in technology infrastructure to support reaching into remote location across the vast country. This rising ICT penetration is a big draw for Logicalis and foreign companies providing technology infrastructure, network and cloud computing services.\n\nRosalynn Tay\n\nCEO\n\nDentsu Singapore\n\nIN many ways, it wouldn't have mattered if Jokowi or Prabowo won the elections: Indonesia's economy is a train that has left the station. No matter who the conductor is, it will keep going. The Indonesian middle class is growing, and their spending power and hunger to consume is something that Singapore businesses can definitely profit from provided you've set yourself up right.\n\nInternational brands like H&M and Ikea are opening stores in Jakarta this year - when these behemoths arrive, others will follow suit. I see great opportunities in the digital arena in the archipelago. The country has come online at the speed of light, almost exclusively on small screens. An advertising network like the one I head in Singapore is, as we speak, exporting digital expertise to our network colleagues in Jakarta to set ourselves up to win in that field. Singapore companies that combine regional power with deep local Indonesian knowledge will come up winning in this fascinating market.\n\nPhilippe Huinck\n\nRegional Managing Director, South and South East Asia\n\nInternational SOS\n\nPRESIDENT-ELECT Jokowi's economic and infrastructure growth plans certainly bode well for businesses and deliver renewed optimism. As the first true businessman to become president of Indonesia, Jokowi brings with him a highly pragmatic, pro-business mindset, having recently appointed a high-powered advisory team to address issues such as building investor confidence, eradicating poverty and accelerating infrastructure development. Key industries that are expected to benefit from proposed policy reforms include consumer and oil and gas, where Singapore companies have expertise.\n\nInternational SOS established its very first clinic 30 years ago in Indonesia. Headquartered in Singapore and London today, we continue to play a proactive role in helping hundreds of companies protect their expatriate staff living and working in Indonesia, providing medical, security and travel assistance services through our Jakarta assistance centre and clinics in Bali and Jakarta. In my view, close Singapore-Indonesia bilateral ties and stronger cross-border collaboration are an obvious win-win for the two neighbouring countries. Specifically, we see plenty of opportunities in the medical, security and travel assistance sectors.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPlan-B Icag Pte Ltd\n\nI HAVE always considered Indonesia to be Singapore's hinterland, not China or India. We are already benefiting much from our current trade and other economic activities with Indonesia. When the new president succeeds in reinvigorating the economy, in particular to develop the infrastructure, streamline an unwieldy bureaucracy and remove obstacles to foreign and local investment, it will unlock the full potential of doing business in Indonesia for Singapore companies. It is almost like a turbo being built into the economic engine of this vast market, whose geometric rate of growth can only further boost Singapore businesses, leveraging on our own success.\n\nThe new Indonesia will be able to create more clones of Singapore in not only the major cities, but also in all cities in this vast archipelago, tapping on the large population and encompassing all spheres of economic activities from infrastructural development to healthcare, education, manufacturing, hospitality, consumer and retail industries, to name a few. What Singapore has can be replicated. This spells myriad opportunities for Singapore businesses.\n\nJokowi won on a platform of democratic reform, which is the flavour of the day in many countries. He and his administration must not create opportunities for the Prabowo opposition to polarise and divide the citizenry. Indonesia cannot afford to degenerate into a situation like that of the prolonged stand-off between the red shirts and the yellow shirts of Thailand, as this can only destabilise the political climate and put a dampener on her economic growth. Singapore companies will need to maintain a close watch on this political risk before entering or investing in the market in a big way.\n\nAnthony Gan\n\nExecutive Director\n\nSingapore Retailers Association\n\nINDONESIA's retail market is one of opportunity, and we are sure a popular business-friendly president will have a positive effect on the economy. Indonesia's retail sector has been attracting foreign direct investments in recent years, and with new infrastructure developments, a vibrant economy and growing disposable incomes, many retailers view the Indonesian market as one of great promise. We have to look only at the Indonesians' penchant for shopping in Singapore to realise that their domestic market has opportunities which we cannot ignore.\n\nWith efforts to combat corruption a priority for the incoming president, and his desire to give Indonesians everything they aspire to, the retail industry will develop rapidly within the country. Businesses are reassured the country is now in a safe pair of hands.\n\nRene Piil Pedersen\n\nDirector, Group Public Affairs, Asia Pacific Region\n\nMaersk\n\nTHE Maersk Group sees much potential in Indonesia, one of the countries in South-east Asia which has been experiencing good growth in recent years. Maersk has had shipping and logistics businesses in the country for more than 50 years. There also lies potential for our other businesses, say in ports and terminals or others which are active in upstream oil production, towage services, offshore supply services, to enter and start operations in Indonesia.\n\nOver the years we have focused on enabling increased trade to and from this largest archipelago in the world. Exports are growing as Indonesia has been one of the countries to benefit from the shift of manufacturing from China to South-east Asia. Imports are also rising due to a growing middle class and a large, young population who are consuming more. The Asean Economic Community which starts next year will also bring about more opportunities for trade.\n\nHowever there is a dire need for improved infrastructure to bring about greater connectivity and a more efficient supply chain. Better infrastructure will also attract more foreign direct investments, which will drive further economic growth. We welcome news from Jakarta that this will be a priority for the new government.\n\nSam Yap\n\nGroup Executive Chairman and Co-Founder\n\nHtwo Investment Holdings Pte Ltd\n\nJOKOWI has been quite vocal about the need for Indonesia to address its shortcomings in infrastructure, manufacturing, and the need to invest more in human capital. His agenda once in office would be to boost the country's economy in order to revitalise it and build up its image in the region. To spur economic growth, the Jokowi administration will come up with new initiatives and reviews of various sectors focusing on strengthening its infrastructure capability, the manufacturing sector and investments in human capital.\n\nIn the short and medium term, there would not be much change to the existing market situations and opportunities. Changes, if any, would likely be in the introduction of more business-friendly policies making Indonesia more open and competitive.\n\nIn line with its interest in investing more in human capital, I see potential growth in the educational and training sectors with the entry of new service providers. With strong political support, chances are good that the Jokowi administration could achieve its targeted economic growth.\n\nRichard Hong\n\nCEO\n\nT\u00dcV S\u00dcD PSB ASEAN\n\nPRESIDENT-ELECT Jokowi has a business-friendly reputation and is supportive of foreign investment. There is also anticipation that his administration will boost basic infrastructure spending in roads, education and health. If these take off, businesses in Singapore such as T\u00dcV S\u00dcD ASEAN, which are well-placed to lend expertise in second- and third-party testing, inspection and technical due diligence, will benefit.\n\nThe huge vote of confidence in Jokowi by the Indonesian people has already driven a sense of optimism among the business community and sparked proactive business actions. Jokowi's team has indicated plans to raise local wages. This may mean higher costs for Singapore businesses but will also help to develop businesses further. Higher wages translate into higher spending power and with Indonesia's burgeoning middle class, this leads to stronger domestic demand especially in consumer products.\n\nWe are in the product, system safety and quality assurance business - so the domestic boost spells potential. Our business in Indonesia has been established for more than 11 years so we are close to the ground. We will continue to monitor our business in Indonesia and are ready to invest further when the opportunity presents itself.\n\nWahab Yusoff\n\nVice-President, South Asia\n\nMcAfee, part of Intel Security\n\nLEADING the 10th largest economy in the world presents many challenges, but Joko Widodo also enjoys the prospect of bringing to fruition the country's huge growth potential. Indonesia's economic prospects are indeed very promising. The country needs a two-pronged approach: 1) attract more foreign direct investments and multinational companies to set up offices in Indonesia; and 2) enable Indonesian firms to expand overseas as well as in the home market. Both can only be achieved with good infrastructure - and in this day and age that certainly includes a reliable and protected communications and information network.\n\nSingapore businesses will certainly look at the opportunities in Indonesia but will have a close eye on how bottlenecks like transport and communications networks will be improved, and on the assurance of safety and security - especially in the digital landscape - to guarantee connectivity, data privacy and confidentiality.\n\nPang Yee Ean\n\nCEO\n\nSurbana International Consultants\n\nWITH the economic reforms proposed by the Jokowi administration and his strong past track record in implementing changes, we can expect to see many business opportunities in infrastructure development in Indonesia for Singapore businesses. The Indonesian construction industry recorded healthy growth from 2009-2013, expanding by an average annual rate of 7 per cent in real terms. While the pace of expansion may be subject to circumstances, we should see even more urbanisation and infrastructure projects being rolled out progressively over the next few years.\n\nSingapore's successful track record in urbanisation will give infrastructure-related businesses such as real estate developers as well as engineering and design companies a competitive edge when they enter the Indonesian market.\n\nJean-Pierre Felenbok\n\nPresident Director & Managing Partner\n\nBain Indonesia\n\nWE are cautiously optimistic about the long-term prospects for the country and its economy and feel that the election results reinforce the odds of success. Indonesia has very strong fundamentals, a large and young population, increasing GDP per capita and a real opportunity to further develop its manufacturing sector for domestic consumption and export, partly substituting for China. Nevertheless, there are both substantial short-term and long-term challenges to address.\n\nIf the new administration manages well in the next few months, Indonesia should trend towards a new and more sustainable \"normal\", characterised by lower growth compared to the past few years (but still much higher than most world economies) and a rupiah value probably closer to its \"true value\". This will require managing the current account deficit more aggressively, in particular through further cuts of the fuel and energy subsidies. The bolder reform agenda needs to address the structural barriers that will drive long-term sustainable growth - including infrastructure, improving public services and more efficient regulatory frameworks, and creating flexibility in the labour market.\n\nThirumalai Chandroo\n\nChairman/CEO\n\nModern Montessori International Group\n\nAS the largest economy in South-east Asia and the world's third largest democracy, Indonesia has the potential to influence the prospects of South-east Asia's business landscape. Jokowi's triumph points to the future of Indonesia's imminent developments and the region's commercial prospects with optimism.\n\nJokowi's strengths in leading the necessary radical reforms are still to be seen and the key to his success rests with his choice of Cabinet. A multitude of decisions that may well take years to implement - and very likely are filled with challenges - await him. Some of these decisions will touch on the neighbouring countries like Singapore where businesses are keen to get their ventures to Indonesia. A self-made businessman, Jokowi has earned his spot in politics with his smart policies that have given good results. His thoughts on being an open democracy and his bid to rein in the nation's toughest issues instil a sense of confidence among potential investors.\n\nAs a vote of confidence in the new administration, the Modern Montessori International Group recently set up a teacher training centre in Indonesia, adding to two franchise centres that have been around since before the July election. Indonesia has always been a rising star in the making and under the Jokowi administration, infrastructure investment and new economic reforms will stand for a renewed attraction of foreign investment inflows. This may make for significant positive change to the relationship between Singapore and Indonesia.\n\nNatalie Shuman\n\nSenior Vice-President, General Manager - EMEA & APAC\n\nKelly Services\n\nINDONESIA is projected to continue achieving economic growth of over 5 per cent in the next years. With any newly installed administration, there will be special focus on various business and industrial sectors with the objective to drive economic growth. Similarly in Indonesia, in order to further boost the economy, proposed programmes include revitalising the energy industry, overhauling infrastructure and encouraging a business climate that will continue to attract foreign investment into the country. All these will translate into a need for stronger talent in the sectors of focus. It creates opportunities for labour mobility and exchange of workforce ideas and solutions not only within Indonesia but across the region.\n\nOne of the key human resource management events in Asia Pacific - the 41st ARTDO International Leadership and HRD Conference and Exhibition and the 6th Indonesia HR Summit jointly held in Yogyakarta this September - cements the importance and further integration of the Indonesian workforce into the APAC region. Kelly is glad to be part of the event and with our wide range of services and our regional presence, we will be able to adequately address the talent requirements and demands of our clients in the focus sectors.\n\nAlick Chia\n\nDirector, Business Support\n\nRSS Asia Pacific Pte Ltd\n\nINDONESIA is a very important neighbour to Singapore both for regional peace as well as economic development. We have worked well with different presidents over the past decades. We should continue to cultivate our good relations with the new president Widodo. In fact, we should endeavour to give him as much as assistance as possible. This is a new era in Indonesian politics and it would be good if he succeeds in bringing about peace and prosperity for Indonesia in the years to come.\n\nIt would be good if we could take some initiatives on our part to provide assistance to Indonesia to help develop its education system and the technical and vocational skills of their people so as to attract manufacturing investments into their country. A peaceful and economically vibrant Indonesia would be good for Singapore and the region.\n\nDora Hoan\n\nCo-Chairman/Group CEO\n\nBest World International Ltd\n\nWITH rich natural resources and abundant manpower, Indonesia has all along been a market full of potential. Nevertheless, in any country, bureaucratic red tape has always discouraged foreign businesses from investing. A more efficient system would have encouraged foreign investment as well as funds and technology for the local businesses.\n\nFortunately, with Jokowi's commitment to pro-business policies, I think we can look forward to greater latitude in conducting businesses in Indonesia. Once the processes are improved, there would be more opportunities for both Indonesian and Singaporean businesses to explore.\n\nDavid Leong\n\nManaging Director\n\nPeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd\n\nTHE \"Jokowi effect\" is a wild card and may have a \"Joker effect\". Jokowi is a pragmatic and hands-on politician pushing through reforms and combating corruption and deals with local issues such as the local business environment and infrastructure in Solo and Jakarta. Singaporean companies that already operate in Indonesia on the lines of the old relationships and patronages may expect certain changes. The new administration is likely to change key appointments and as such, the cards on the table will be reshuffled - hence the \"Joker effect\".\n\nGoing forward, it may be easier for Singapore companies to forge ahead on a corruption-free agenda. Indonesia's economy is still fragile with large current account deficits heavily impacted by the US Federal Reserve cutting back on its stimulus programme. This drying up of global dollar liquidity will affect the stock markets of emerging economies, particularly Indonesia, due to their reliance on external financing. Jokowi has to deal with this looming weakness in its financial system and Singapore companies dealing there must accept these systemic risks.\n\nOn the back of its natural and manpower resources, if Jokowi can overcome its weak financial status with aggressive attraction of foreign companies to shift production from higher-cost China to Indonesia, Indonesia can be the next big thing in Asia. When Indonesia is the next big thing in Asia, Singapore will enjoy the spillover effect and can be instrumental in Indonesia's next leap of growth.\n\nAnnie Yap\n\nManaging Director\n\nAYP Associates Pte Ltd\n\nIT has been challenging for businesses to enter the world's 10th biggest economy. However, under the new Jokowi administration, Indonesia's economic prospects are definitely bright. Jokowi's unprecedented move of making his advisory team known signals his resolve in advocating greater openness. More importantly, his successor, Basuki Tjahaja Pumama, will be the very first ethnic Chinese to become governor of Jakarta. This also bodes well in terms of the willingness for Indonesia to accept cultural diversity and move away from the closed mindset against local Chinese and foreigners.\n\nAs Indonesia gradually becomes more receptive to cultural diversity, it would also benefit the country as it attracts more foreign investments. Singapore businesses can capitalise on the opening up of Indonesia and expand into the region. Furthermore, with our proximity to Indonesia and as members of Asean, it would be strategic for Singapore businesses to expand into Indonesia.\n\nChristophe Duchatellier\n\nCEO\n\nAdecco Asia\n\nSINGAPORE and Indonesia have always enjoyed the mutual benefits their strong relationship brings and we look forward to opportunities and growth. Clearly, the new administration will embark on initiatives to rebuild the infrastructure and strengthen efforts to woo foreign investors and business. Opportunities include growth in oil & gas as well as consumer markets, be it in finance or services. Singapore has built a name for itself as the regional hub for IT, financial services and oil & gas, and investors can look forward to prospects in Indonesia.\n\nAs Indonesia rebuilds itself and realigns its overall mission, it would be heartening to know what the two governments can do to better boost both economic and business partnerships.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The beer, however, has thankfully remain unchanged.\n\nThis weekend, Singapore plays host to the World Series of Darts for the first time. The world's top eight players have flown in, and are competing for a cash prize of US$100,000 at the Singapore Indoor Stadium tonight.\n\n\"People tend to dismiss the game until they learn that the top guys earn easily over \u00a31 million (S$2.08 million) a year. Then their eyes open wide, and suddenly they're interested,\" said Matthew Porter, chief executive officer of the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) - the organisation behind the inaugural Singapore Darts Masters.\n\nAnd building a global interest in darts is exactly what PDC has in mind. While traditionally played and watched by fans in the UK and Europe - in Britain, it is the second-biggest televised sport behind soccer - the game of darts is gaining popularity in other parts of the world, including the Middle East and Asia, Mr Porter said.\n\n\"Asia is really our biggest development region. The key is to get events like these out here, to get audiences and sponsors excited. It has already been done in Britain and Europe, where the game has grown to a level where it's recognised as a professional sport,\" he added.\n\nPDC sells over 500,000 tickets worldwide annually, and organises live darts events 70 days a year. The rewards are enticing - in 2014, a total of \u00a37 million is up for grabs.\n\n\"It's a genuine career option,\" said Mr Porter, who is hoping to capture the imaginations of Singaporean darts followers - estimated at around 10,000.\n\nSaid Matt Bennett, partner at Shield Sports Asia, which is staging the event in association with Radar Sport & Entertainment: \"If you think about it, Singaporeans would be great at this. You need good numeracy in your head, sound strategy, and enormous mental strength and nerve. There's no reason why a Singaporean player couldn't make the world circuit.\"\n\nCue the name Paul Lim, who isn't as well-known as he perhaps should be.\n\nIn 1990, the Singapore-born player became the first person to achieve a nine-dart finish in a world championship, completing a perfect game of darts - similar to a 300-point game in bowling - in front of a televised audience of millions.\n\nThe feat earned him the nickname \"The Singapore Slinger\" and a \u00a352,000 bonus - more than the eventual tournament winner, Phil Taylor, who received \u00a324,000.\n\nMr Lim, who now lives in the United States, is unable to attend this weekend's event although Mr Taylor - the world's top- ranked player - is competing.\n\nBut the fun isn't confined to the players; darts competitions are known for their Oktoberfest- style atmosphere. Rambunctious audiences heckle as much as they cheer, and there is also a free flow of beer.\n\nThis year, Shield Sports Asia expects a crowd of at least 2,000 people, split evenly between expatriate and local attendees. The competition will also be beamed across the globe to a television audience of up to 10 million.\n\n\"It's a new event here, so 2,000 (attendees) may not sound like a lot. But there's certainly the possibility of growing the event beyond that. UK crowds number over 10,000, and that's been developed over 20 years,\" said Mr Porter. In fact, he believes this weekend's event could become an annual one in the future.\n\nAs for the sceptics, Mr Porter has this to say: \"They should just go and watch the competition. I would bet myself to give anybody a good time.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

His grandfather is the late cabinet maker Carl Hansen, who started his bespoke furniture workshop in 1908.\n\nIt was by coincidence that Mr Hansen joined the family business as its CEO 12 years ago. He had previously worked as a shipping trainee for the now defunct East Asiatic Company, and was later the managing director for Tempur mattresses, before he sold off the company. From 1998 to 2002, Carl Hansen & Son was headed by Mr Hansen's elder brother, Jorgen Gerner. Of his elder brother, Mr Hansen says: \"We are very different in the way we manage the company. My brother had very little interest in expansion.\"\n\nThe younger brother had plans to start his own business, and asked to sell his shares to his older brother. \"But he asked me to buy his shares instead, and to take over the company,\" says Mr Hansen. \"I agreed, because I saw that the firm had potential.\"\n\nSince taking over, Mr Hansen has expanded the firm from 17 to 250 people, invested in new machinery and recently bought two new factories in Denmark.\n\nMr Hansen has ambitious plans for the business. He says the firm will make more than S$100 million in sales worldwide this year, and over the next three years, the company will double in size. Nearly 85 per cent of the products are exported overseas, with Japan being its biggest market outside of Denmark.\n\nCarl Hansen & Son's most famous piece of furniture is the Wishbone chair, with some 40,000 pieces sold annually. It was designed in 1949, by then unknown Danish architect Hans J Wegner, who was approached to collaborate with Carl Hansen & Son, when Mr Hansen's father, Holger, saw the need for the company to work with architects and designers for it to expand.\n\nThe Wishbone chair has a characteristic Y-shaped back and the hand-woven seat consists of more than 120 metres of paper cord, which takes a skilled craftsman an hour to weave.\n\nWegner went on to design other iconic pieces, including the Shell chair, the Easy chair and the Sawbeck chair. \"Some of Wegner's pieces, such as the Shell chair, was considered too avant-garde for its time - it is only in recent years that it has taken off,\" says Mr Hansen.\n\nTo mark the 100th anniversary of Wegner's birth, Carl Hansen & Son is launching Wegner's CH88 chair - a 1955 design that has, to date, existed only as a prototype.\n\nIn Singapore, Carl Hansen & Son is sold at Space furniture store.\n\nMr Hansen has no background in design, but his childhood home was next to the company's factory. \"In a way, design and furniture did interest me,\" he says. His home is naturally filled with pieces from the company. \"I've got a big house, and there's lots of space to display about 70 to 80 chairs.\" He describes his grandfather as a kind and quiet man, and \"people loved working with him as he was honest\".\n\nOn Wegner, Mr Hansen says: \"He was a very quiet man, and he would come to our summer house and fly his giant kite.\"\n\nIn the past, Carl Hansen & Son only worked with Danish designers, with Wegner as its most celebrated. Mr Hansen wants to shake things up by collaborating with non-Danish designers, one of whom is Japanese architect Tadao Ando. \"I see Carl Hansen & Son as an international company, so it was only right to start working with designers outside of Denmark,\" says Mr Hansen. Since Japan is their biggest export market, Mr Hansen began his search for a designer there. \"And who else would you pick in Japan besides Tadao Ando,\" he asks.\n\nThe Dream chair, which was launched last year, is Ando's first foray into furniture design. The chair, which appears to be floating, is made entirely of three-dimensional veneer. \"Architects have been snapping them up, and the public will probably take it up about six months later,\" says Mr Hansen. He quips: \"Ando is the first living designer that I've worked with.\"\n\nDespite him having no design background, Mr Hansen has a clear idea of what good furniture design is, and why Danish design has been so well regarded. \"Something that will last in people's mind and that will last physically,\" he says. \"It must not be fashion. It should be a piece that you are still happy with 30 to 50 years later.\"\n\nMr Hansen is prepared to hand over the business to the next generation. His two sons, who are 20 and 21, have shown an interest. \"I hope they will take over, but I won't force them to do so.\"\n\nHe has no plans to retire as yet, but when his sons do take over, Mr Hansen says he will definitely step down. \"The previous generation stepped down when the next generation took over. I will do the same.\"\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\n@TaySuanChiangBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

No one was aboard.\n\nThe parked B747, one of only 24 jumbos at the carrier, was sliced open by the wing of a wide-body United jet that was being towed, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the details are private.\n\nA spokesman, Christen David, said that the accident occurred on July 28 near an O'Hare Airport maintenance hangar but declined to elaborate.\n\nIncidents such as this are rare, with damage far beyond the dings known in the industry as \"ramp rash\" and are tracked closely by the US Federal Aviation Administration. The agency will monitor the fixes to the B747 to ensure they meet US standards, said a person familiar with agency operations.\n\n\"Usually, tow accidents are a broken tow bar piercing the skin, not aircraft-to-aircraft violence,\" said Robert Mann, a former American Airlines executive who is now an aviation consultant based in Port Washington, New York.\n\nUnited's Chicago-based parent, United Continental Holdings Inc, hasn't publicised the collision, which occurred away from the terminals at the second-busiest US airport.\n\nThe B747 involved in the collision is ordinarily operated by United on charter flights, and repairs by Boeing are still under way, said Ms David. The other jet was a B777, a wide-body model used on long-haul international routes.\n\nThe B747 suffered damage to its radome, which houses radio antenna equipment in the nose, as well as a punctured pressure bulkhead, one person said. The fixes will cost almost US$4 million, another person said.\n\nThe bulkhead is crucial because it seals the front of the plane from the atmosphere, ensuring proper air pressure at high altitudes. Faulty repairs to a bulkhead at the rear of a Japan Airlines B747 were blamed for a 1985 crash that killed 520 people, according to the Aviation Safety Network website.\n\n\"Replacing a pressure bulkhead would be a major repair, pretty expensive\", with a bill running into the millions of dollars, said Mr Mann.\n\nWhile rare, ground accidents with significant damage do occur. In 2003, a single-aisle Airbus A319 owned by Northwest Airlines ploughed into one of the carrier's B757s at a gate at New York's LaGuardia Airport. The A319, which was being taxied by mechanics, also struck a concrete jetway support, shearing off its nose gear.\n\nAbout six metres of the B777's wing required repairs, two people said. The aircraft model is the world's biggest twin-engine jetliner.\n\nThe B777 has been fixed and returned to commercial service, Ms David said. United substituted other aircraft for the long-haul jet, and was able to avoid disrupting the flight schedule, she added.\n\nThe 18-year-old B747 is the airline's only jumbo dedicated to ferrying troops under a US military contract, two of the people said.\n\nMs David declined to identify any charter customers for the plane. The airline is using other jets to fulfill its charter flights while the jumbo is being repaired, she said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

In Asia, it is in countries such as India, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, Vietnam, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Philippines.\n\nFoodpanda CEO Ralf Wenzel told BizIT during a visit to Singapore that the plan is to keep breaking new ground in markets where online food delivery isn't mainstream.\n\nThe company has found that even in most first-tier cities, there isn't a dominant food delivery site that works with a variety of restaurants, and it's hoping that it can quickly move in to this space.\n\n\"In every market, food delivery is pretty much offline still, so we want to be the first mover,\" Mr Wenzel said.\n\nFoodpanda works by providing its delivery order system to restaurants. The company takes orders from consumers via its website or mobile app and passes the orders along to the restaurants. It takes a cut from the restaurants on each order.\n\nThe site's additional value proposition to food places is the stream of hungry visitors to the website that may be attracted to ordering from a new place.\n\nParent company Rocket Internet's modus operandi is to take e-commerce business models that have done well and replicate them in emerging markets, often rapidly expanding its footprint from the get go. Its other businesses such as Zalora and Lazada are headquartered in Singapore, and operate in the region from this base.\n\nDespite Foodpanda's youth, it already has 800 employees globally, with its engineers and central marketing team in Berlin. Its 20 staff in Singapore generally work to acquire more restaurants under the Foodpanda umbrella. They also help with technical installations for restaurants which have their own systems but also want to integrate with the Foodpanda network.\n\nMr Wenzel explained that with larger chains such as Sarpino's Pizza in Singapore, these players often have their own point-of-sale (POS) systems. In order to help win over restaurants, Foodpanda's software works with existing POS systems, so restaurants don't have to abandon the hardware they've already invested in.\n\nFor smaller restaurants which don't have their own systems, Foodpanda has its own order printer that it places within restaurants. This allows kitchens to take orders from customers on Foodpanda and indicate when orders have been dispatched.\n\nTill recently, online food delivery has been a luxury service reserved for users with easier access to Internet connectivity, but the proliferation of smartphones is changing that, said Mr Wenzel.\n\n\"In the beginning, I didn't expect the (spread) of mobile usage to be so fast. In Western Europe, we're doing more on the Web, like buying travel tickets. But in emerging markets, the (desktop) is bypassed, and buyers are going straight to the mobile,\" he said.\n\nAnd in emerging markets in Asia, this momentum is fast outpacing that of developed markets, where users are still accustomed to going to their desktops as a first contact point with e-commerce, he added. Asian users are going straight to the mobile phone because that's also become the first gateway to the Internet for many.\n\n\"The smartphone is a luxury that people can afford earlier in life than apartments, or cars, or TVs, even. You can expect someone to have a smartphone in countries like Senegal or Bangladesh, before they get a TV,\" he noted.\n\nFoodpanda has shifted gears and plans to pour in a larger proportion of its engineering hours into the mobile, as a result of this trend, he added.\n\n\"Initially, we thought of mobile as an additional channel to the Web, but we now see that more users are on the mobile. Mobile growth rates are also twice that of Web, and mobile retention rates and average basket sizes are higher too. This is true across all the countries we're in,\" he said.\n\nBeing available on the mobile, however, doesn't solve the issue of cashless payments, where far fewer people have credit cards in emerging markets than that of developed peers.\n\nJana, a mobile advertising platform, conducted a survey last year that revealed an average 32 per cent credit card usage across Asian, South American and African emerging markets, for instance.\n\nThis lower accessibility of cashless payment poses a challenge for e-commerce businesses.\n\nBut Foodpanda remains confident of its prospects in these markets, said Mr Wenzel, who insisted that there are plenty of ways around credit cards such as cash-on-delivery, e-wallets with telcos and scratch cards.\n\nFoodpanda is positioned as a commodity service, not a luxury, he said.\n\nThe company, which adds hundreds of restaurants to its roster every day across the globe, has 25,000 restaurants on the site right now. By the end of next year, it wants to reach 100,000 restaurants, he said.\n\nIts volume of orders grows 15 per cent week-on-week, he said. \"Eventually, I want us to be the standard for food ordering. Like how WhatsApp is synonymous with messaging.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Japfa, which produces milk, poultry and beef in Indonesia, has established a similar industrial farming business model in Vietnam, Myanmar and India for poultry, and in China for dairy products.\n\nIt intends to use the IPO proceeds to build a five-farm hub in Inner Mongolia. The funds raised will also go towards growing its business in China and the Indochina region and paying off borrowings, including pre-prepayment charges.\n\nLast year, the group registered a net profit of US$41.8 million, declining 22 per cent from 2012 while revenue increased 16 per cent to US$2.7 billion.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This could enable them to clear some units and generate cash flow - rather than maintaining the status quo and doing nothing as market conditions deteriorate further.\"\n\nThere will be heightened competition for buyers as more property launches are expected by developers who had bought residential land after December 2011. These developers are required to complete the projects and sell all units within five years, otherwise they would have to pay a hefty additional buyer's stamp duty on the land price with interest, Ms Chia noted.\n\nEven amid the weak July developers sales stats released yesterday by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), evidence is surfacing of developers successfully drawing out buying demand through attractive prices, highlights SLP International executive director Nicholas Mak.\n\n\"For instance, Wheelock released The Panorama in Ang Mo Kio in January this year, posting a median price of S$1,343 psf for sales in that month. But since it reduced prices in May to the S$1,200-plus psf level (median price), this project has been among the top sellers every month,\" he said.\n\n\"This goes to show that developers can revive sales at existing launches with meaningful price cuts. What remains to be seen, however, is whether this will result in a price war, which could be triggered, for instance, if one player were to sharply cut prices relative to other projects in the vicinity.\"\n\nURA's July data also revealed that the remaining 37 units at The Vermont on Cairnhill, which was completed last year, were sold at S$2,113 psf median price in July. This is 8.6 per cent below the S$2,313 psf median price, based on caveats data, for all previous sales in the project by its developer, said OrangeTee research head Christine Li.\n\n\"Vermont's brisk sales show many high-end buyers are on the sidelines waiting to enter the market once prices become attractive,\" she noted. \"In the private housing market as a whole, a 10-12 per cent price cut is typically enough to draw buyers in droves.\"\n\nLast month, developers sold 484 private homes excluding executive condos (ECs), just two more than the 482 units they moved in June. In July last year, the figure was also 482 units.\n\nDevelopers also offloaded 51 EC units last month, compared with 49 in June and 112 in July 2013. The weak home sales mirrored their strategy of holding back on major launches.\n\nThere were only four new launches last month - of which three were in the city fringe.\n\nThe top seller was City Gate on Beach Road, with 89 units transacted at a median price of S$1,809 psf. Near Kitchener Road, the developer of The Citron Residences found buyers for 23 units at S$1,585 psf median price. In the West Coast, 11 units were sold at Bijou at S$1,969 psf.\n\nIn the first seven months, developers sold 4,893 private homes and 354 EC units. For the whole of last year, the figures were 14,948 private homes and 3,588 ECs.\n\nFor the rest of the year, predicts Ms Li, EC sales will gather momentum and probably overshadow sale of mass-market private condos. There has not been a single new EC project launch in nearly a year, which means pent-up demand can be expected to manifest for five expected EC launches by year-end.\n\nSome market observers expect genuine buyers to increasingly head for the resale market to pick up a completed property, including units in newly completed projects.\n\n\"These buyers can pick up something in the spot market, and within a short period either move in or rent it out,\" noted Savills Singapore research head Alan Cheong.\n\n\"Of course, the advantage of buying at a new launch from a developer is that buyers can make progressive payments for their property purchase, based on the phase of the project's completion. And in the case of leasehold property, they get an almost fresh lease term on their investment.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The classic 1936 play The Women by Clare Boothe Luce certainly portrays them so.\n\nStaged countless times on Broadway and adapted onto film three times (the most recent 2008 production starring Meg Ryan), the play centres on catfights and backstabbing among women over - what else? - men. But it also reaffirms certain bonds between women that are good, kind and unbreakable. And it remains one of the few plays in modern theatre's canon that features a large all-female cast of characters.\n\nNow The Women is set to be staged at the Esplanade Studio in a Malay translation directed by the talented Alin Mosbit. And she's assembled a cast of mostly popular TV actresses who, unknown to many, actually started out in theatre before venturing into TV. They include Siti Hajar Gani and Nadia Din - as well as the priceless stage actress Nora Samosir.\n\nThe Women tells the story of society wife Mariam (Siti Hajar) who discovers, through the malicious machinations of her own friends, that her husband is having an affair with a perfume shop assistant. While preparing for a divorce, Mariam finds herself embroiled in circumstances that allow her to get her husband back.\n\nThe story was originally set in 1930s New York high society. But director Alin has transposed it to 1950s Singapore where well-off women in kebayas and bling bling jewellery roam the society scene.\n\nAlin says: \"There was a certain bourgeoisie mentality then. Many of these women were connected to old money or Malayan royalty. They didn't work and spent their time gossiping and poking into other people's business. I thought it made for a perfect backdrop for The Women.\"\n\nAlin is best known for her humane and hilarious feminist plays such as Beautiful Fish and . . . And Three Virgins Fly To The Moon, and has adapted the script to include many local references and humour.\n\nShe says: \"Even when transferred to the Singapore context, The Women maintains its kernel of truth about women - that women are often their own source of inspiration and sabotage. We could be more supportive of each other's happiness and successes, instead of diminishing each other.\"\n\nLead actress Siti Hajar concurs: \"There's a lot of talk these days about how social media sites and dating apps are affecting marriages and relationships, because they've made it easier and faster for strangers to connect. But it's not the technology we should be blaming - it's our own human fallibility we need to look at.\"\n\nThe Women (Wanita) by Clare Boothe Luce will be staged at the Esplanade Theatre Studio from Aug 28 to 31 at 8 pm, with weekend matinees. Standard tickets at $30 are still available from Sistic for Aug 31. Other slots are sold out.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Aug 15, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHERE is a new Nissan Qashqai and it has suddenly transformed itself into a sharper, less cuddly-looking crossover. The previous version of this UK-made model by Japan's second biggest carmaker had softer and more amorphous styling. But the new car gets more masculine lines for a much sportier stance.\n\nThe front end with its \"3D\" clamshell bonnet and full LED \"boomerang\" lights is purposeful, while the flanks are distinctively sculpted. Big 19-inch wheels that come as standard equipment also add to the newfound machismo.\n\nAll these make the new Qashqai look bigger but it isn't; it is only 50mm longer at 4.38 metres with its 2,646 mm wheelbase extended by 16 mm. It is also 15 mm lower at 1.59 metres high, but Nissan has managed to improve headroom by lowering the hip point.\n\nThe interior is also slightly plusher, with a dashboard in dark tones and ambient lighting in the lower centre console.\n\nAlso improved is the boot opening, which is now wider with better tailgate clearance.\n\nUnder the more curvaceous bonnet, the naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine gets a new feature - direct injection. This two-litre unit is mated to the latest-generation Xtronic continuously variable transmission (CVT) featuring what Nissan calls Active Lock-Up Control. What this does is improve responsiveness by reducing the CVT's so-called rubber-band effect, where engine and road speeds do not match and the clutch feels and sounds like it is slipping.\n\nAs a result, the non-turbo engine's 144 hp and 200 Nm are more potent than they sound and the Qashqai is pretty brisk. The option to \"shift\" the seven-step CVT manually using the gear lever adds to the Nissan's sportiness.\n\nLike its predecessor, the Qashqai's handling feels more European than Japanese and Nissan has introduced several features to enhance its driveability.\n\nFor a start, the redesigned Electronic Power Assisted Steering reduces the overall steering ratio by 5 per cent for improved responsiveness.\n\nAt the same time, Active Trace Control improves the Qashqai's dynamic ability by applying the brakes to each wheel to correct the cornering line, although this is done only at lower speeds.\n\nAnother braking feature is Active Ride Control. It monitors the wheel speed to detect bumps which could upset the ride and applies subtle braking to individual wheels to increase body control and hence, ride comfort. To reduce braking effort, a feature called Active Engine Brake can be selected using the multi-function display. This employs the CVT to increase engine braking while cornering for greater control and less pedal effort.\n\nTogether, these driving aids complement the new and more dynamic styling pretty well.\n\nsamuelee@sph.com.sg\n\nSPECS\n\nNissan Qashqai\n\nEngine\n\n1,997cc\n\nGearbox\n\n7-step continuously variable transmission\n\nMax power\n\n144 hp @ 6,000 rpm\n\nMax torque\n\n200 Nm @ 4,400 rpm\n\n0-100 kmh\n\n10.1 secs\n\nTop speed\n\n184 kmh\n\nCO2 emissions\n\n159 g/km\n\nAverage OMV\n\nS$20,500\n\nPrice\n\nS$136,800 (with COE)\n\nDistributor\n\nTan Chong Motor Sales\n\nTel\n\n6466 7711\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Revenue fell 6 per cent to S$164 million.\n\nThe company managed to reduce operating expenses by 7.6 per cent to S$48.4 million.

The distribution division, which makes up nearly two-fifths of Tat Hong's business, contributed a significant portion of the decline. The division saw revenues drop 14 per cent, largely due to falling sales of excavators in Indonesia.\n\nTower crane rental remains the bright spot as its revenues jumped 21 per cent on the back of China's massive urbanisation efforts. The division, which now makes up 15 per cent of Tat Hong's revenue, looks set to grow further.

In addition, CDL is seeking to develop fund management products, its top brass said yesterday as the group posted a 32.8 per cent drop in second-quarter net earnings to S$137.86 million. First-half net profit also fell 24.9 per cent to S$257.53 million.\n\nOn fund management, where the group lags behind its Singapore peers such as CapitaLand and Keppel Land, CDL's strategy will be to initially monetise some of its existing assets. This would build a track record, giving for instance fixed returns to investors while providing long-term capital appreciation. In the longer run, CDL will not rule out a \"discretionary\" model, as is adopted by many private-equity outfits, of raising cash from investors first before purchasing assets.\n\n\"If you look at our competitors, many of them have multi-billion-dollar funds management businesses. Subject to market conditions, I don't see a reason why at some point, a five to 10-year horizon, we would not be targeting that type of business,\" said Grant Kelley, who was appointed CEO of the company earlier this year. He was formerly from Apollo Global Management and Colony Capital.\n\nKwek Leng Beng, CDL's executive chairman, said the group has not taken full advantage of its hotel portfolio, held under its London-listed subsidiary Millennium & Copthorne Hotels (M&C). He floated some possibilities. \"One day if it is prudent and viable, why don't we throw all our hotels into a Reit (real estate investment trust) and make this the biggest Reit ever in Singapore? As another example, why don't we get all our provincial hotels in the US plus UK, put them into a Reit? That is another model.\"\n\nAs for expanding Down Under and in Japan, CDL's strategy is likely to be dominated by hotels, commercial and residential - the three asset classes it is best at in the Singapore market. \"We are actively looking at a number of opportunities currently ... In the next 12 months, we hope we'll have some concrete and exciting investments that will be consummated,\" said Mr Kelley, declining to give details.\n\nLate last month, Australian Financial Review reported that CDL and Australia's Stockland Group are considering bidding for Leighton Holdings' US$7 billion residential and commercial property portfolio. The Leighton Properties business is expected to fetch up to A$500 million (S$580 million), according to the report.\n\nAt yesterday's briefing, CDL also gave an update of the headway it has made in other overseas markets: China and UK. It has picked up six freehold properties in UK since last year for \u00a3157 million (S$326 million): two in Knightsbridge and one each in Chelsea, Belgravia, Croydon and Reading. The intention is to reposition them predominantly as residential projects to tap the undersupply in the London housing market.\n\nSaid Mr Kwek: \"I personally believe that now with Middle East in bad shape, more and more funds and rich individuals will park their money and buy something\" in London.\n\nLater this year, the group could launch its first major China project - Eling Residences in Chongqing.\n\nIn Singapore. the group may release a 124-unit freehold condo, New Futura, on Leonie Hill Road in Singapore in the second half of this year, subject to market conditions.\n\nOne-fifth of the 500,000 sq ft of offices at its South Beach Tower in Singapore has been committed. Besides Rabobank, tenants clinched include De Lage Landen, TMF Group and Bain & Company; advanced negotiations are going on with a few more major potential tenants. The 34-storey tower is expected to be completed by year-end and CDL hopes to pace out leasing activity to ride on rising office rents.\n\nThe drop in CDL's Q2 and H1 bottom lines was due to the absence of significant divestment gains which had boosted the same year-ago periods. In Q2 2013, CDL sold 100G Pasir Panjang, after selling strata units in Citimac Industrial Complex, Elite Industrial Buildings 1 and II in Q1 2013.\n\nCDL's revenue rose 5.9 per cent to S$861.15 million in Q2 and edged up 0.4 per cent in H1 to S$1.595 billion. Shareholders will receive a special interim dividend of four cents per share, down from eight cents in H1 last year.\n\nEarnings per share fell to 14.5 Singapore cents in Q2 2014 from 21.8 cents in Q2 last year. The counter ended 27 cents lower at S$9.78 yesterday. CDL released its results before the stock market opened.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

After all, the franchise was written for a specific audience - the kind that are also fans of the Grand Theft Auto video games - so it's only natural the story by Stallone (and co-written by Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt) adopts a shoot-first-talk-later approach.\n\nThe bad guy this time is Stonebanks (Gibson), a rogue ex-member and co-founder of The Expendables, who has since become a ruthless arms dealer. He's supposed to be dead after Ross (Stallone) killed him but shows up out of the blue and vows to exterminate The Expendables.\n\nHe fires a warning shot by injuring the group's barrel weapons specialist, Caesar (Terry Crews). Fearing for the lives of the other members, Ross disbands the group and instead hires a bunch of youngsters who are a little more up to date with modern warfare to help him take on Stonebanks.\n\nBut when the new Expendables are captured by the bad guys, it's up to Ross's old boys to step in and save the day.\n\nAmong the newbies, Banderas is most memorable as a motormouth Spanish sharpshooter who gets on everybody's nerves with his incessant yakking. His humorous turn comes also as a breath of fresh air compared to Stallone and gang's deadpanning.\n\nGibson - no stranger to playing loose cannons in the Lethal Weapon and Mad Max films - goes the whole nine yards and looks like he's having fun playing a full-blown psychopath for a change; while Ford, who replaces Bruce Willis as the CIA agent, could have done with a meatier role and better lines.\n\nThe Expendables 3 is big and dumb because boys will be boys and retiring to play golf clearly isn't this pioneer generation's idea of fun.\n\nRating:\n\nC+\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Feat or flop? The brand new Singapore International Festival of Arts (SIFA) raises its curtains with Facing Goya, a radical boundary-bashing opera directed by Ong Keng Sen, who is also, not coincidentally, the festival director of SIFA.\n\nComposed by British composer Michael Nyman, with a libretto by Victoria Hardie, Facing Goya takes the audience across three time spans to examine how the skull of Francisco Goya, Spain's legendary painter, is being used by eugenicists to create the perfect human being.\n\nThe science-based opera is heavy on discourse, outlining the ethical debate on social engineering as it is first used by Nazi scientists to promote the Aryan race, and then by a modern-day biotech company for genetic manipulation.\n\nFor this and other reasons, Facing Goya is as far from the romantic worlds of Puccini, Verdi and Strauss as you can get. And the sooner you discard any expectation of traditional opera, the better you can appreciate this work.\n\nThe music by Nyman is neo-baroque post-minimalist, characterised by melodic passages that can abruptly give way to outbreaks of atonality. Hardie's libretto combines the arguments for and against eugenics with an off-kilter sense of humour.\n\nSimilarly, Ong does not attempt to portray the events in a realistic manner. With deliberately spare blocking and a generous Brechtian distance, the actors face the audience and sing their lines as if they were delivering a lecture. The set is a white backdrop on to which gorgeous images are projected, while costumes are fittingly eclectic.\n\nThis is contemporary opera beyond John Adams' Nixon In China and closer to Philip Glass and Robert Wilson's avant garde Einstein on the Beach. It's neo-baroque meets Brecht meets borderline insanity.\n\nWhile I am a lover of classical opera, I am also a fan of Ong's cutting-edge art, having championed his works before, including his last four productions, Fear of Writing, Lear Dreaming, National Broadway Company and Goh Lay Kuan & Kuo Pao Kun. His oeuvre has been as wonderfully diverse as it has been divisive.\n\nBut I must also point out that while his works are often conceptual and challenging, they have rarely been this anarchic before. There was method and clarity in the style of the previous four works; Goya, in contrast, feels stylistically incoherent.\n\nIn the first half of the opera, Goya is sombre as it depicts the sinister efforts of Nazi craniologists in determining Aryan superiority. But in the second half, Goya becomes giddy and campy as it portrays the scientists in a modern-day lab trying to uncover the genetic code for genius.\n\nHere, the multimedia design derives inspiration from contemporary art and scrambles the projection screen with gorgeous abstract images often spliced with Damien Hirst's famous diamond-studded skull - also physically replicated here to represent Goya's skull.\n\nThe second problem I have with Goya is the fact that the opera has been trimmed from its original 2.5-hour run to its present two-hour duration. The cuts here seem less than judicious, since it's hard to understand why Goya's skull was stolen, how it came into certain hands, and what the main character of the Art Banker (Suzanna Guzman) stands for.\n\nWith Facing Goya, Ong confirms his status as an eccentric iconoclast, unafraid to split his audiences' opinion down the middle, and draw cheers and jeers simultaneously. Unfortunately, some audience members are obviously not clued in on the conceit - which explains why some didn't return to their seats after the intermission, and the man next to me briefly snored.\n\nI did not make that statement to insult the artist or overstress the importance of the audience reaction over the work's merits - only to point out how Ong as an artist has always raced past prevailing theatrical conventions without looking back. Sometimes, even long-distance runners lose their stamina.\n\nhelmi@sph.com.sg\n\n@HelmiBT\n\nFacing Goya plays at the Victoria Theatre tomorrow night at 8 pm.

The competition is only going to become more intense,\" said Amber Dubey, head of aerospace and defence at consultancy KPMG.\n\nA large, and increasingly affluent, population makes India one of the world's most attractive air travel markets. Passenger numbers have risen 13 per cent a year since 2003 - a rate analysts say outpaces most other markets.\n\nBut intense competition and higher operating costs mean Indian airlines lost a combined US$1.77 billion last year and are projected to lose up to US$1.4 billion this year, according to data from industry consultancy CAPA - Centre for Aviation.\n\nThat compares with the US$18 billion profit airlines globally are expected to make this year, up from last year's US$10.3 billion, International Air Transport Association (Iata) data shows.\n\nLow-cost carriers such as Indigo, SpiceJet and GoAir have cornered two-thirds of the domestic market, and were joined this year by a joint venture between Malaysia's AirAsia and Tata Sons.\n\nFull-service carriers compete for the remainder one-third domestically, and with foreign carriers such as Emirates, Qatar Airways, British Airways, SIA and Lufthansa on international routes.\n\nIncreasingly, they must also battle one another. \"There is demand at the upper end in India but it is nothing like the demand at the bottom end,\" said Kapil Kaul, chief executive for South Asia at CAPA. \"You now have three airlines competing for the same customer.\"\n\nAir India is the most unprofitable carrier, but is also the one most likely to survive the battle for passengers because of government support.\n\nThe carrier, which received a US$5.8 billion state bailout in 2012, halved its operating losses for the 2013-2014 fiscal year to 21.2 billion rupees (S$433 million) by restructuring its operations over several years and cutting costs. It retired older aircraft and introduced fuel-efficient planes such as the Boeing 787, and plans to add new Airbus A320s and Boeing 737s.\n\nAir India also finally joined the Star Alliance group of carriers this year, allowing it to leverage the network of, and traffic feed from, partners such as Lufthansa, United Airlines and All Nippon Airways.\n\n\"The Indian government owns us. Just like any other promoter, they will pump money into their investment,\" said a senior Air India executive who did not want to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media. \"Do you think the government will allow us to fail after investing so much money?\"\n\nJet Airways, which has yet to turn a profit since 2007, said that it would focus solely on full-service to gain market share. It barely survived a battle with Kingfisher Airlines, which folded in 2012, and its balance sheet is shored up by Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways, which bought a 24 per cent stake this year.\n\nThe intense competition across all sectors will probably result in fewer airlines in India, analysts say. \"We expect consolidation over the next 12-18 months,\" said Mr Dubey. \"At the current level of air travel penetration, the Indian market can only support at the most four strong pan-Indian airlines.\" - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

It's as if the film, directed by Hanung Bramantyo, couldn't quite make up its mind about which aspect to focus on.\n\nGiven the external issues the filmmakers had to deal with (see accompanying story) and also perhaps as a result of decisions made in the editing room, it's not surprising that Soekarno ended up with a split personality. Despite its flaws, the film is aided to some extent by a sense of shared destiny with our neighbour during the period covered, especially during the war years. Students of history and anyone old enough to remember those turbulent times will find some interesting material to digest here, although they may have to endure stiff melodrama to get to it.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Drake & Scull International, the emirate's second-largest publicly traded builder, took two term loans totalling about 199 million dirhams in the first half, according to its financial statements.\n\nWhile both builders are benefiting from rising orders, the need to borrow from banks means costly interest payments and could slow the completion of projects, according to analysts. A rapid expansion of Arabtec's backlog has added to the company's arrears, while delays for redesigns and cost overruns in Saudi Arabia are hurting cash flow and profitability at Drake & Scull.\n\n\"The payment situation for contractors hasn't improved since the beginning of 2013\" even as the Dubai economy strengthens, said Taher Safieddine, an analyst at Shuaa Capital in Dubai, on Wednesday. \"Working capital is continuously under pressure, which is forcing contractors to go to the banks to cover the shortfall.\"\n\nCalls and emails to Arabtec seeking comments on their funding needs were not returned, while a public relations executive for Drake & Scull declined to comment.\n\nBoth Arabtec and Drake & Scull are getting term loans, facilities and overdrafts from their banks, Mr Safieddine said. Arabtec's debt climbed by 392 million dirhams in the second quarter to 1.29 billion dirhams.\n\n\"The majority, if not all, bank loans extended to contractors tend to be tied to specific contracts and projects,\" said Artur Uluc, director of corporate finance at Mashreq Bank in Dubai, on Wednesday. \"The loans are typically more expensive than those provided to other types of companies because recovery on a specific project can be tricky if a contractor isn't paid.\"\n\nShort-term loans to builders can be priced at 275 basis points to 425 basis points over the benchmark Emirates interbank offered rate, or Eibor, Mr Uluc said. The three-month Eibor fell to 0.72 per cent yesterday, close to a low reached on July 12, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.\n\nArabtec will probably need to raise cash through debt or equity \"within months\" because existing authorisations to increase capital expire by the end of the year, Allen Sandeep, a Cairo-based construction analyst at Naeem Brokerage, said in a note to clients. Delaying fundraising into 2015 would create the need for new approvals from the board and the regulator, he said.\n\nArabtec's backlog has surged by 70 per cent to more than 23.8 billion dirhams since the end of last year, putting pressure on the company's working capital at a time when a \"good amount of subcontracting\" requires the company to commit cash, Mr Sandeep said.\n\n\"The issue is new projects that have come into the backlog in past year and half but haven't turned into revenue yet\" for Arabtec, Alia El Mehelmy, a Cairo-base equity analyst at CI Capital Holdings, said by phone. \"The challenge is kick starting these projects.\"\n\nAt Drake & Scull, \"significant\" delays on projects in Saudi Arabia as well as cost overruns in general contracting in the first half are affecting operational margins and profit, chief financial officer Mukhtar Safi said in a statement on Sunday. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM", "images": []}

And what does the PA+ stand for anyway? L'Oreal's expert in photoprotection lays bare the facts. By Cheah Ui-Hoon\n\nPublished Fri, Aug 15, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSO here are the definitive guidelines: You want to apply sun protection of at least SPF15 but it need not be higher than SPF50. You also want to look for creams or lotions that screen out UVA besides UVB, especially in Asia where the sun is more intense.\n\nBy now, sun protection is such a norm, especially in the tropics, it's surprising to find out that SPF standards came out only about 30 years ago. Even though the first commercial product was brought to the market in the 1930s, introduced by the founder of L'Oreal.\n\nIt's just in recent years though, that scientists are getting a better understanding of UVA just now, as opposed to just UVB. \"Now, the need to be protected against UVA radiation is much clearer,\" says Dominique Moyal, Technico-Regulatory expert in photoprotection, L'Oreal Research & Innovation.\n\nThere are two parts to UVA, she points out, which accounts for up to 95 per cent of the solar UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface. UVA is known as the ultraviolet with a longer wavelength, but there is short UVA and long UVA.\n\nUVB stops at 290-320 nanometres, and short UVA comes right after, between 320-340 nm. Then long UVA goes up to 400 nm - and this is the one which causes pigmentation and wrinkles.\n\nUVA in general is less harmful in terms of cellular and DNA damage than UVB.\n\n\"But it is more damaging in terms of pigmentation and wrinkles,\" points out Dr Moyal.\n\nThink of UVA as rays which age, and UVB as rays which burn.\n\nIn Asia, skin cancer such as basal carcinoma or melanoma is less frequent in the population compared to Europe or Australia. \"In Asia, the percentage of skin cancer is really low probably due to the genetics of the skin but also to the different behaviour in terms of sun exposure,\" says Dr Moyal.\n\nAsian skin, with its naturally high levels of melasma and phototypes 3, 4, or 5, is more sensitive to UVA however, and the consequence is pigmentation. Asians are especially prone to problems with hyperpigmentation spots, or melasma.\n\nHowever, even though UVA causes wrinkles, Asians are genetically less sensitive to wrinkles, Dr Moyal notes, with wrinkles appearing later in Asians compared to Caucasians.\n\nWrinkle problems result from UVA penetrating more deeply into the dermis, attacking the dermis' fibres, causing wrinkles. \"With UVA exposure, there is a photo oxidation of the melanin. So you have immediate darkening. After one hour in the sun, you get darkening. That's why you must protect against UVA,\" advises Dr Moyal, who was in Singapore recently for the launch of the La Roche Posay Anthelios XL Ultra-Light Fluid SPF50+ designed especially for the Asian tropics.\n\nAs for selecting SPFs, it's all a question of skin colour. For the Asian phototype 3, an intermediate skin colour, between SPF15 and 50+ is required, says Dr Moyal. \"But even if you have darker skin, you always need to have UVA protection. An SPF30 with a UVA 15 or higher for dark skin it is the best solution,\" she suggests.\n\nFor \"normal\" skin, which means skin without problems recovering from DNA damage, then the SPF50 is maximum number you need. \"SPF 100 is for people very sensitive to UVB or with a problem of DNA repair. It's not useful in Asia, because based on genetics, there is no big issue of repair to the DNA,\" she adds.\n\nShe says that there are very few countries having regulations allowing SPF of 100. It's 50+ in Japan, Korea and Asean, and 30+ in China. \"Because SPF100 are for people who are very sensitive to UV light or with skin cancer, for example, when you are talking about pathology.\"\n\nShe adds: \"It is more important to have a good balance of protection between UVA and UVB. SPF protection has both short UVA and UVB protection and globally, SPF mainly offers UVB protection.\"\n\nAnd really, SPF is related to the time you spend outside.\n\n\"If you spend only one hour in the sun, SPF 15 is enough. But if you spend more time exposed, you have to increase the factor according to the amount of time you spend in the sun,\" reiterates Dr Moyal. Applying it uniformly is another important practice.\n\nNormally, when applied in a uniform layer, for about six hours, a single application of a SPF50+-PA4+ (PA++++) is sufficient. For longer exposure, re-application would be needed depending on the sun's intensity.\n\nuihoon@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

TAY SUAN CHIANG offers a glimpse into these 'secret' gatherings\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Aug 14, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nPSST . . . have you heard? The trend of supperclubs is going strong in Singapore, but those password-required, location-unknown events have gone into the design and music scene as well.\n\nHipster store The Redundant Shop has held two by-invite only events for design folks and customers. Since June, the shop at Everton Park has held two Back Door Access events, so called because guests enter via the shop's back entrance. And yes, a password is needed before entry is granted.\n\nWatson Lee, founder of The Redundant Shop and design publication The Redundant Magazine, came up with the idea for Back Door Access after attending similar private events in Shanghai, such as a motorcycle launch in an abandoned warehouse.\n\n\"I was struck by the secrecy of the event, its invitation-only guest list and especially the location of the event - an abandoned warehouse that no one took notice of,\" says Mr Lee. \"I had to walk through back lanes of houses to get passwords and directions from the residents before arriving at the venue.\"\n\nHe now holds monthly Back Door Access events, where about 50 people turn up each time to meet and listen to designers talk about their work. The vibe is fun, with a DJ spinning music, free-flow of drinks and often a workshop, where guests can get crafty.\n\nJeffrey Koh, founder of creative firm Flab Slab, has also been holding secret events at his studio in Commonwealth. Friends and family get invited to his F**king Friday events, where they are welcome to doodle on his studio walls.\n\n\"It is an opportunity for pals to come and spend some time together,\" he says. He is open to having members of the public join in as well.\n\nF**king Fridays take place so randomly that Mr Koh is not able to say when the next one is. He has held six since he started the event last November. \"I usually announce that I will be having one a week or so in advance. Those who want to come will start scrambling to change their plans or make it after dinner,\" he says.\n\nMeanwhile, an increasing number of people are turning up at strangers' homes to listen to music instead of heading to clubs and performance venues.\n\nSofar Sounds, which started in London in 2010, is now in 86 cities across 37 countries. Sofar Sounds Singapore began last year. What happens is music fans turn up at private gigs, usually held in a local resident's living room, to listen to a band play.\n\nSofar Sounds co-founder Rafe Offer and two friends came up with the idea after noticing that many people in a bar were talking or fiddling with their phones during a musician's set. \"We thought how crazy it was that great music was ignored - even when people bought a ticket. We thought there must be a better way to experience this,\" says Mr Offer.\n\nThe appeal of Sofar Sounds, says Mr Offer, is that the event is focused on the music, and nothing else. A list of gigs playing in the different cities is put up on the website, and guests sign up for a gig in their home city.\n\n\"You don't know the acts until you show up, and you don't even know where it will be until the night before, so it is a bit of an adventure,\" says Mr Offer. \"We are also obsessed with getting a range of great music on, so you might just hear 'the next big thing' - but in someone's living room.\"\n\nHe adds that Sofar Sounds aims to create a richer, more intimate experience for fans and also the musicians.\n\nWhile some organisers are keen to get the word out on their events, Mr Lee prefers to keep his guests list tight. \"We want Back Door Access to be exclusive, so that we can focus on the right target audience,\" he says, adding that space is limited, hence the invitation list cannot be extensive. \"I think by keeping it private, there will be more interest, or should I say curiosity, about the event.\"\n\nEnter via password\n\nTHE invitation to The Redundant Shop's by-invitation only event comes with an advisory - \"Don't be shocked that our shutters are down when you try to come through our front door.\"\n\nInstead, guests enter by the back, hence the event name, Back Door Access. The Redundant Shop's founder Watson Lee says many underground parties in the United States are like that. \"The Redundant Shop in Everton Park has an unique back door area that you don't see a lot of anymore in Singapore,\" he says. \"So we thought why not use the back door as the entrance, since Back Door Access starts only after the shop closes and when the shutters comes down.\"\n\nThe store has held two Back Door Access events since it started in June. At each one, a designer talks about his works and inspirations. Award winning Singaporean designer Melvin Ong of Desinere, known for making vases and paper weights using the pleating technique, was the first speaker. Last month, Mr Lee flew in Mexican designer Guillermo Juarez of Cazapapeles for Back Door Access. Mr Juarez is best known for his cardboard creations, which include life-sized sculptures of polar bears and wolves. Incidentally, Cazapapeles means paper hunters in Spanish.\n\nAt Back Door Access, Mr Juarez not only showcased his works, which are cardboard sculptures used to put across a message, but also did a live demonstration of how he creates a wolf using cardboard.\n\n\"There are no restrictions in who we want to invite, but rather, we are constantly looking for passionate people who might need a platform to share to a very targeted audience group as well as for the group of new talents to expose their work to our audience,\" says Mr Lee.\n\nHe adds that Back Door Access is not just a platform for talks, but \"we hope to encourage more independent artists, aspiring designers, or even publishers to launch their work through the monthly event.\"\n\nThe third Back Door Access will be held later this month, and it will be a book launch.\n\nThose who get invited include shop customers, business partners as well as people from the design industry. Entry to the event is via a password, which will be made known upon RSVP.\n\n\"But of course we welcome anyone who is interested and who knows someone from The Redundant Shop network to come join us,\" says Mr Lee.\n\nBack Door Access is more than just a monthly gathering event, says Mr Lee. \"It was intended to allow our customers to understand the inspiration as well as the face of the creators behind some of the products we sell at The Redundant Shop.\"\n\nChilling out over art and toys\n\nWHAT happens when you put a group of doodlers and toy collectors in a room? Crazy stuff, such as having all the walls doodled on, which is essentially what happens at a F**king Friday event.\n\n\"As the farcical name F**king Friday implies, this is really just an excuse for people who are into art and toys to hang out on a Friday evening with free flow of Redbull and whatever drinks they can find in our fridge,\" says organiser Jeffrey Koh, founder of creative firm Flab Slab. \"We see this as a gathering of like-minded people to get together and have fun. It is an excuse for us to invite people over to our studio one Friday a month.\"\n\nF**king Friday, started last November, and takes place almost once a month. On its name, Mr Koh says that Friday is the day that every working adult looks forward to, and it is also the time when people start thinking about what to do and where to party. \"So what better way than to start off the weekend by proclaiming it F**king Friday.\"\n\nIt started with a handful of Mr Koh's friends turning up, coming by to chill and chat till the wee hours of Saturday mornings. Soon, friends started bringing their friends and the circle widened. There would be about 30 people at each F**king Friday, \"but the number can grow to 100 when we have overseas artists in town visiting us,\" says Mr Koh.\n\nThe gathering takes place at the Flab Slab studio at Commonwealth after office hours, when other tenants in the office building have left. The security guards are informed there will be a late night party happening.\n\nMr Koh explains that at each F**king Friday, the folks from Band of Doodlers and Tell Your Children come over to doodle and draw on the studio walls. \"Those into toys will sometimes transact or trade with each other. We'll also talk about what is hot and what's not and what's happening in the scene in general.\"\n\nMr Koh says he does this out of a personal interest in art and toys. \"I don't make any money out of it at all. It is tough to find a place in Singapore where you can hang out with friends and strangers without any pressure to buy anything. I also see this as an opportunity for people to make new friends and collaborate on projects some time down the road.\"\n\nWhile it has been friends and family who come, Mr Koh welcomes the public too. \"Since it is usually held in the studio and we can put together the event quite quickly, we don't have fixed dates. The best way is to check out our facebook page at www.facebook.com/flabslab or send an email to mastermind@flabslab.com to find out more details,\" he says.\n\nUltimately it is all about people coming together. \"The only yardstick is that everyone should have fun. You don't have to pay for anything, not even a cup of coffee since drinks are always on the house.\"\n\nEnjoying live music at strangers' homes\n\nA CONCERT hall isn't the only way to enjoy a live gig. What about going to someone's home instead?\n\nSofar Sounds is exactly that - listening to live music from the comfort of one's living room. It was an idea that took root in 2010 in London, and to date, it has spread to 86 cities in 37 countries.\n\nHere's how it works: You sign up on the website, and each month, you receive a list of gigs and the cities they will be in. Sign up for the gig that you want, and the exact location will only be revealed the day before the gig.\n\nDepending on the response, you could be in an intimate group of about 20 people listening to some original music.\n\nThe Singapore branch of Sofar Sounds was started last April by Sam Drury, a Londoner who works in foreign exchange. Ms Drury hosted the first Sofar Sounds at her home in Serangoon. Since then, there have been six gigs held here.\n\nSome of the musicians who have performed include Inch Chua, Monster Cat, The Good Life Project and The Sam Willows.\n\nMs Drury says, while response has been encouraging, it can be better.\n\nShe cites the example of how sometimes it can be difficult to find bands willing to be a part of Sofar Sounds, which means fewer gigs available.\n\nInterested bands have to audition before they are accepted. \"We do want to have the best bands play,\" says Ms Drury. She is part of a team of volunteers who review bands live and through video and sound clips. \"It is the same in other cities. Only when a band gets positive reviews, are they then invited to play.\"\n\nShe adds: \"We like original, high quality music. Nothing that is over produced or too formulaic.\"\n\nMost bands do unplugged sets. \"Even for the punk bands, which is a chance to see them in a different setting, and you get to see them upclose too,\" says Ms Drury.\n\nApart from bands, Ms Drury hopes to see more people coming forward to volunteer, to be reviewers or to help in sound and videography. All gigs are video recorded and put online, so fans can watch the musicians whenever they like. Currently, Flutter Sound Studio, a recording company and boutique media production firm, Cat on a Ledge, have been great supporters of Sofar Sounds, by providing their services.\n\nGigs are mostly held in a living room. \"Hosts only need to provide a space. The sound crew will come by earlier in the day, to see the best place for the band to be in. We tell guests who are coming to bring their own drinks,\" says Ms Drury. Each gig is free.\n\n\"Coming to a Sofar Sounds gig lets you listen to music in a new environment. You don't know the lineup till the day, so there's a bit of mystery in it, and you get to meet like-minded people,\" she says.\n\nThe biggest satisfaction she gets out of doing this? \"When I see the audience around the living room, nodding their heads to the music.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Without currency fluctuations, underlying net profit would have been up 5 per cent.\n\nEarnings per share worked out to 5.24 Singapore cents in Q1 FY15, down from 6.35 Singapore cents in the corresponding quarter a year earlier.\n\nThe quarter's results felt the impact of staff restructuring costs of S$27 million and a S$17 million share of India's Bharti Airtel's exceptional loss for various disputes and provisions.\n\nThe corresponding quarter last year was also lifted by an exceptional gain of S$150 million from the dilution of its stake in Airtel.\n\nSingTel's unit Down Under, Optus, reported a 1.8 per cent slide in net profit to A$164 million (S$190.2 million) due to exceptional items relating to a provision for workforce restructuring. Otherwise, underlying net profit rose 12.3 per cent to A$187 million.\n\nRival operator Telstra yesterday unveiled a strong set of results, reporting a 14.3 per cent rise in full-year post-tax profit to A$4.28 billion and announced plans for a A$1 billion share buyback.\n\nMeanwhile, SingTel's share of associates' pre-tax profits grew 7.6 per cent to S$622 million with strong earnings growth from Airtel. Excluding currency translation effects, it would have been up 19 per cent.\n\nIn Singapore, SingTel's mobile revenue rose 2 per cent to S$518 million, while SingTel's pay-TV service mio garnered more than 100,000 home subscribers for the 2014 Fifa World Cup, with mio TV revenue up 65 per cent at S$63 million. Excluding 2014 World Cup revenue, mio TV revenue would have been S$53 million.\n\nRevenue for the group's enterprise segment was more or less flat at S$1.56 billion, as higher mobile and ICT revenue in Singapore was offset by lower revenue in Australia. Ebitda fell 7 per cent to S$510 million with margins coming under pressure.\n\nIts group digital life segment earned revenues of around S$48 million, up 61 per cent, with higher advertising revenues. However, negative Ebitda for Q1 FY15 widened to S$45 million.\n\nSingTel said it expects consolidated revenue and Ebitda for the full financial year to be stable.\n\nMeanwhile, CIMB analysts expect that negative foreign currency effects should abate in the coming quarters as associate currencies have stabilised.\n\n\"Operationally, associates performed within expectations; Bharti was the star performer, with strong revenue growth and margin expansion,\" they said in a research note.\n\nOCBC Investment Research analyst Carey Wong said yesterday that results and guidance were mostly in line with OCBC's forecast. However, given the rally in the stock price in recent months, Mr Wong downgraded his call on the stock to \"hold\", opting to buy at S$3.85 \"or better\".\n\nIn the stock market, SingTel shares were four cents lower yesterday at S$3.87.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Subsales are secondary-market transactions in uncompleted projects.\n\nIn the high-end segment, nearly all subsale caveats for non-landed private homes lodged for H1 were traced to units that had been bought in 2009 and 2010 and which therefore would not have incurred SSD. There was no caveat for units in Core Central Region (CCR) that had been previously bought in 2012 to 2013.\n\nIn the mass-market segment, 73 per cent of subsale transactions involved properties that had been bought in 2009 and 2010.\n\nSSD was introduced in 2010 for residential properties bought on or after Feb 20, 2010 and flipped within a year. Later that year, SSD was extended to properties bought on or after Aug 30, 2010 and sold within three years.\n\nSince early 2011, the holding period has been extended to four years with sharply higher rates. Residential properties bought from Jan 14, 2011 and sold within four years incur SSD of 16, 12, 8 or 4 per cent if they are sold in the first, second, third or fourth year of purchase respectively.\n\n\"Back in 2009, pre-SSD, there were units flipped within the same year of purchase,\" said Feily Sofian, a lecturer at Ngee Ann Polytechnic's School of Design & Environment.\n\n\"However, in H1 2014, there were no subsale caveats registered that involved units bought last year.\"\n\nSubsales are secondary-market transactions of units in projects that have yet to receive Certificate of Statutory Completion and where the titles for all the units have yet to be issued. They are seen as a gauge of the level of property speculation.\n\nGiven their long holding periods, most of the H1 subsale transactions were profitable, though the proportion of subsales that were in the black was higher in the mass-market segment, where prices have climbed at a faster clip from the Q2 2009 trough.\n\nSeventy-five per cent of the 40 subsales in CCR made money. In Outside Central Region (OCR), where mass-market homes are located, the proportion is 97 per cent, out of 142 subsales.\n\nProfit or loss was calculated by comparing the latest price against the price at which the unit had previously changed hands, factoring in the prevailing SSD rates (if applicable). However, other costs such as interest, legal fees and the additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) were not counted.\n\nMs Sofian, who teaches the real estate business diploma course, said that ABSD was not included because it rested on who the buyer was and how many residential properties they own - \"which is something we can't ascertain\".\n\nNgee Ann mined Urban Redevelopment Authority's Realis data for caveats of subsales of non-landed private homes in OCR and CCR in H1. It then sought out caveats data for previous transactions of these units. As at Aug 11, 2014, there were 147 subsale deals in OCR in H1, with previous transaction information traced for 142.\n\nThe average profit on the 138 profitable subsales in OCR was S$221,275 (translating to a 24 per cent gain). As for the four remaining subsales that were in the red, the average loss was S$35,646 (or 5 per cent).\n\nGiving a split of the profitable subsales in H1 by the year in which the units had been bought, Ms Sofian said that in OCR, the biggest average profit of S$379,603 accrued to units that had been bought in 2009 - the nadir-year of the Singapore private housing market after the global crisis.\n\nSubsale gains thinned for units bought in subsequent years, with those picked up in 2012 and subsold in H1 2014 posting an average gain of S$104,500. The four unprofitable subsales involved properties bought in later years, 2011 and 2012.\n\nIn CCR, there were 42 subsales in H1 and of these, caveat matches of previous transactions were found for 40 properties. Among the 30 profitable subsale transactions, units bought in 2009 and 2010 posted average gains of 14 per cent and 16 per cent respectively.\n\nThese are lower than the average gains for subsale transactions of mass-market units in the first-half involving units bought in the same years - 37 per cent for units picked up in 2009 and 25 per cent for units bought in 2010.\n\n\"This is in line with the market trend, as seen in the stronger rise of 72 per cent in URA's price index of non-landed homes in OCR between Q2 2009's trough and Q2 2014 - compared with a 42 per cent increase in CCR over the same period,\" said Ms Sofian.\n\nThe polytechnic collaborated with the www.propertytrends.com.sg website started by SLP International executive director Tony Koe in his private capacity .\n\nSubsale transactions will probably remain subdued in coming months.\n\nKnight Frank chairman Tan Tiong Cheng said: \"So long as the low interest rate environment continues, the authorities are unlikely to remove cooling measures.\n\n\"Investors are now caught not only by SSD when they need to trade or swap private residential properties to rebalance their portfolio, but deterred from making a purchase in the first instance due to the ABSD. On top of that, the foreign buying contingent is still missing - which reduces liquidity in the market.\n\n\"First-time buyers will be spoilt for choice.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That's the lowest since March 2011. The report also showed that surveyors have cut their forecast for price growth as stricter lending rules and the prospect of increased borrowing costs weigh on the market.\n\nLast month, demand in the capital fell at the fastest pace in six years, RICS said, after a surge in prices over the previous year stretched affordability and prompted concern that a bubble may be forming. BOE governor Mark Carney announced measures in June to curb a buildup of housing debt that officials said posed a risk to Britain's recovery.\n\nThe central bank's cap on loan-to-income ratios was announced in June as mortgage lenders were already grappling with new requirements to assess affordability for borrowers. Mr Miles said yesterday that those rules will help prevent a return to the excessive household borrowing that fuelled previous crises.\n\nThe new mortgage rules and the prospect of rate increases \"have taken the edge off the housing market, particularly in London\", said Rob Wood, an economist at Berenberg Bank. \"Nevertheless, beyond the near-term the fundamentals continue to signal strong house price inflation. It's a welcome development that lenders have a very clear responsibility to assess whether people can live with the possibility that interest rates on their mortgages might go up.\" The rules are \"a good line of defence\".\n\nRICS said that its national price gauge slipped to 49 last month from 52 in June. An index of new-buyer inquiries fell to minus two from seven, indicating the first drop in demand since January last year.\n\n\"The BOE is far more willing to signal its unease with regard to market developments and their risks,\" RICS said. \"It has gone out of its way to engineer a change of mood, through a series of high-profile verbal interventions and warnings, particularly in relation to London.\"\n\nRespondents to the RICS survey cut their forecast for annual average home-price growth in the UK over the next five years to 4.7 per cent from 5.9 per cent in March. The projection for London was lowered by more than half to 4.6 per cent from 9.3 per cent.\n\nIn a survey for mortgage lender Halifax last week, 57 per cent of people saw the next 12 months as a good time to sell, suggesting a view among homeowners that prices are peaking. A separate poll showed that 49 per cent of UK mortgage holders are cutting spending in anticipation of a BOE interest-rate increase.\n\nRICS chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said: \"A range of policy initiatives adopted by the Bank of England in recent months alongside heightened expectations surrounding a turn in the interest-rate cycle has clearly had an impact on sentiment in the market.\"\n\nHe said that the shift in London has been particularly pronounced, \"but that in a sense is consistent with the move to a more sustainable market\". - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM", "images": []}

It posted sales of US$593 million for its latest quarter.\n\nWhen asked about Singapore's position as a gaming hub, a King spokeswoman said: \"There is a lot of games development talent in Singapore, so it's great (for us) to have a studio here... Nonstop Games is a fantastic company with extremely talented developers. For them, it means becoming part of a larger company with much bigger resources.\"\n\nAccording to King, the acquisition was formally sealed on Aug 6, with total consideration comprising US$6 million upfront cash, and up to US$84 million of contingent consideration dependent on revenues from games developed.\n\nKing also made an additional upfront payment of US$10 million to certain Nonstop Games employee shareholders, in exchange for their continued employment for a year following the acquisition date.\n\nThe startup, formerly known as GamesMadeMe and founded in 2011 by four Finnish nationals (Teemu Ikonen, Henrik Karlstr\u00f6m, Juha Paananen and Henric Suuronen), is now looking to hire more game developers here, as part of its expansion plans.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They started small, launching English singles one at a time.\n\nThe success of two singles led to plans for a full English album and discussions on this started in March 2005.\n\nPointing to e-mail correspondence on this, Kong's lawyer, Edwin Tong, asked why his client had pushed for the worst-case profit and loss projections.\n\nThe church founder explained that Xtron Productions, which supported the Crossover Project, was investing in the production of the album. So it mattered if Xtron was \"financially sound\", as the Crossover Project would be affected if the album failed, said Kong.\n\nThe court heard that one of Xtron's director, Wahju Hanafi, who is a close friend of Kong, was to bear the losses if the album failed.\n\nAll these factors prompted Kong to question the music producers on the financial commitment that was required of Xtron and the feasibility of the goals, including getting Ms Ho to perform at the Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nIn 2006, rapper Wyclef Jean and his business partner, Lisa Ellis, were roped in by music producer Justin Herz, to help with the album. But this collaboration was short-lived as Kong had concerns about the increasing budget projections provided by Mr Jean and Ms Ellis. He felt the estimates were not sound.\n\nBy late June 2008, Kong pointed out to Mr Herz via e-mail that the budget from June 2008 to May 2009 had gone up by more than US$9 million. Kong then raised doubts about the targets set for Ms Ho and the recoverability of Xtron's investments. By November, the deal was off the table.\n\n\"I got to do my utmost,\" said Kong, \"to ensure that Xtron doesn't get into the red as far as the album project is concerned, that they do not lose money for what they have put in, into the album project, because the church has invested this Building Fund into Xtron; Xtron has used the bond proceeds to support the album project. So I was very concerned that the church cannot suffer any loss, that all the investment that the church put into Xtron, the church must be able to get back with interest.\"\n\nKong admitted that in hindsight, he could have handled the matter better and seek the advice of more experts.\n\nThe defence tried to make the point about Kong's lack of mens rea or criminal intent - that his actions were carried out with the church's interests at heart.\n\nAnother point made - that Kong's deputies had been vigorous in ensuring the budget was sound as they would seek the opinions of the church's then auditor.\n\nKong, along with five deputies, are accused of misusing millions of church funds to boost the career of Ms Ho. Some of the accused also face allegations of trying to cover up the misuse through \"sham bond investments\" and round-tripping.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Suez Canal has larger capacity and is cutting into Panama's share of global shipping traffic, which has \"slowly sapped our revenues\", said Mr Quijano.\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi recently launched the construction of a US$4 billion \"new Suez Canal\" running parallel to the original that aims to accelerate traffic and sharpen its competitive edge.\n\nCloser to home, Nicaragua - which fought Panama more than a century ago to host the first canal across Central America - has re- emerged as a modern-day rival.\n\nThe country has granted a 50-year concession to Chinese businessman Wang Jing to build and operate a canal that would have larger capacity than Panama's and be able to handle modern mega-freighters too big for its rival's current dimensions.\n\nLast month, Nicaragua finalised the route for the US$40 billion project, which Mr Wang's HK Nicaragua Canal Development Investment Co (HKND) wants to complete in five years.\n\nTo fend off the competition, Panama is adding wider locks and channels to nearly triple the canal's capacity.\n\nThe expansion will allow it to handle so-called \"Post-Panamax\" ships with a capacity of 12,000 containers, instead of the current maximum of 5,000.\n\nBut the hugely ambitious project has been plagued by delays, strikes and a bitter dispute over US$1.6 billion in cost overruns with the consortium of companies carrying out the upgrade.\n\nThe expansion was initially scheduled for completion this year, but has now been pushed back to January 2016.\n\nPanamanian officials say it will eventually triple the government's annual revenues from the canal. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

NUS has also lowered the entry criteria for its honours courses in four schools, and will rename the degrees, doing away with the first-, second- and third-class classifications in favour of US-style \"distinction\" or \"merit\" designations. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) also said last week that it will allow its freshmen to drop F grades in up to six courses in the first year so as not to tarnish their grade-point average. The idea is to reduce the pressure on students and shift the focus away from grades, with NUS in fact mulling the possibility of an entirely grade-free first year. And in the case of its honours programmes, NUS said the easing of entry requirements is to enable more students to graduate with honours. Both universities insisted that their moves would not lead to a decrease in the quality of graduates.\n\nIndeed, given Singapore's rigorous and demanding education system, typically seen as too focused on exams and grades, the latest changes in NUS and NTU would seem like a breath of fresh air, and may well be the way to go as the local tertiary scene evolves in line with global norms. Yet, questions also arise, especially in light of another recent and somewhat controversial change: a new scaled-down Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) for military men, to enable more of them to pass the fitness test. Are young Singaporeans too mollycoddled ? Where does one draw the line between being responsive to changing circumstances and pandering to populist demands?\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They may also be assured that credit bureaus will be more vigilant over the use and security of their credit data.\n\nThese are among the key implications behind proposed regulations governing credit bureaus, announced yesterday by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). These freshly proposed rules, to be implemented through a new Credit Bureau Act, are aimed at maintaining data confidentiality, security and integrity, the MAS said in a consultation paper.\n\nIt has proposed that the two credit bureaus in Singapore - Credit Bureau (Singapore) and DP Credit Bureau - be licensed, with each licence valid for five years.\n\nTo hold - and keep - those licences, the bureaus must tighten the management of their business and operational risks. This entails ensuring a comprehensive risk-management system and proper outsourcing arrangements, the MAS said. It added: \"The licensing regime will enable MAS to improve the standards for fair credit reporting among licensed credit bureaus, and strengthen the protection of confidential credit data and consumers' rights in Singapore.\"\n\nThe MAS will hold the power to investigate and impose fines if the credit bureaus flout the rules.\n\nThe two bureaus will be given six months to meet the new requirements.\n\nThe MAS has also proposed that members of licensed credit bureaus, such as banks and finance firms, provide consumers with free copies of their credit report within a certain period of a credit application being approved or rejected. This is in line with international practices, it said.\n\nConsumers who want to buy their credit reports dating back to a specific time frame would also be allowed to do so.\n\nLincoln Teo, the general manager of DP Credit Bureau, said that presently, consumers are unable to judge the integrity of their personal credit information because some financial institutions do not send their data to both credit bureaus. \"DP Credit Bureau sincerely hopes that the licensing regime will bring about greater data parity, which will increase integrity and accuracy of the credit data. This will ensure robust credit assessments and a fair outcome for borrowers.\"\n\nA spokesman from Credit Bureau Singapore said the bureau welcomed the proposed changes:\n\n\"The role of the credit bureau will become increasingly important now that new measures on unsecured credit have been introduced.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The upside will come from the growth in e-commerce, IT support and FMCG sectors that could continue to grow on the back of heightened consumption in Asia with increasing affluence,\" Dr Chua said.\n\nThe city-state's growth was closely followed by Auckland's 4.4 per cent and Beijing's 2.5 per cent growth, as vacancy edged lower in all these locations.\n\nGrowth remained steady at 2 per cent in Tokyo, while small rental increases of 1-1.5 per cent were seen in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Manila.\n\nRents in Jakarta fell for the first time since the third quarter of 2009, down 0.4 per cent on a quarter-on- quarter basis. JLL said this was due partly to occupier caution and with business expansion put on hold before the presidential election in July.\n\nCompared to the second quarter of 2013, office rental growth in Singapore was 15.9 per cent.\n\nThe city-state outpaced Jakarta to become the regional outperformer on an annual basis, followed by Taipei, Bangkok and Jakarta at between 7.5 and 8.5 per cent.\n\nRental growth also far exceeded capital value gain in the Singapore CBD office market, which saw a quarterly 0.5 per cent growth in capital value in local currency terms. Compared to Q2 last year, the gain in capital value was 2.1 per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There are many, not in the few hundreds, but some thousand or so who may be let go. It will also involve those holding senior positions who have made some poor day-to-day decisions,\" said a reliable source. Staff cuts, deemed a low hanging fruit in keeping MAS afloat, appear to be inevitable for the airline which has a bloated workforce of 19,577 employees (as at end 2013) but it's a painful decision it has long evaded, not least for fear of a political backlash.\n\n\"Layoffs are not easy. It's an emotional subject as it's about one's livelihood. The airline wants to be very careful in deciding who will be laid off, who can be trained or redeployed and those who need to retire,\" the source added.\n\nIn terms of employee productivity metrics, MAS falls short. Last year, every MAS employee raked in revenues of RM772,000, about half that of Singapore Airlines.\n\nThe cuts will be done in a just manner. \"If Khazanah is prepared to pay a decent sum to take MAS private, then it's a given that employees who will be taken off will be offered a morally fair sum. The airline is not going to simply shaft people. Also, it wants to avoid the political noises that may arise,\" said the source.\n\nLast Friday, Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund Khazanah proposed to take MAS private by offering remaining shareholders 27 sen per share - an exit plan for minority shareholders that will cost RM1.4 billion and deemed fair by the analyst fraternity and needless to say, a relatively more preferred option to total collapse or bankruptcy.\n\nThe airline's last downsizing took place eight years ago and cost nearly half a billion ringgit in payouts to some 2,600 employees. \"For a company that has hardly done any clean-up over the years, it's about time they made these tough decisions instead of doing the token layoffs and small tinkerings with staff count,\" said an astute observer of the airline.\n\nA 19 per cent reduction in workforce and 10 per cent capacity cut could nearly halve the airlines estimated losses in fiscal 2015 of RM767 million, according to RHB Research.\n\nYet, there are major hurdles. One of them is the fear that a big-scale cut could lead to disgruntlement among a workforce, whose morale has already been beaten down by the recent tragedies, and, in turn, trigger political ramifications at the polling booth.\n\n\"MAS and politics are intertwined. You can't do something to MAS without worrying about its impact on politics,\" said a top executive of a Malaysian firm.\n\nMAS's forceful union has demanded that it has a say in the restructuring plans and has called for the resignation of chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, whose three-year term ends next month and who has been conspicuously absent from the public eye since the downing of MH17 over strife-torn Ukraine, quite unlike when he appeared at daily media briefings when flight MH370 went missing in early March.\n\nOn its part, MAS said on Monday that its leadership met the employee unions and other associations to inform and engage them on the revamp plan.\n\nThe airline is expected to release its second-quarter results next Wednesday which most expect to be harrowing numbers. For the January to March quarter, a traditionally soft patch worsened by dented sales due to a missing MH370 enroute from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing which still remains a mystery, the firm suffered its biggest quarterly loss in two years of RM443 million.\n\nNot many are convinced that taking MAS private will revive the sick airline. Malaysia's former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad yesterday weighed in on the plan with outright scepticism. \"Khazanah has been in full control of MAS all this time. And all this time MAS has been bleeding profusely. In 10 years, it has lost RM10 billion in terms of capital injection.\n\n\"Khazanah's 100 per cent ownership of MAS will not be much different from its 70 per cent ownership,\" he wrote in his blog.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Mr Bao, who had been a strategist at a Chinese technology company before setting up his own boutique investment bank in 2004, would occasionally prod Mr Guo about his plans.\n\n\"I asked him why he was still working for Google and not as an entrepreneur,\" Mr Bao recalled in a recent interview. \"He didn't say anything, but was giving the knowing smile. That moment I knew he had already caught the bug and would launch his startup one day.\"\n\nHis guess proved correct and he later helped Mr Guo raise money for his startup, an online retailer called LightInTheBox. When Mr Guo decided to take the company public last year, Mr Bao's bank, the China Renaissance Group, was his first choice for the deal, even though the firm had never worked on an initial public offering (IPO) before.\n\n\"I had had a long relationship with Fan,\" Mr Guo said in a recent interview. He hired China Renaissance because \"they really understand the China market. They are really steeped in the China market. And they really understood us.\"\n\nFor Mr Bao, winning friends in China's budding startup community has been a boon to business. Fourteen months after LightInTheBox listed in New York, Mr Bao's upstart bank has managed to leapfrog some of the biggest names on Wall Street. It ranks No 2 on the list of underwriters of Chinese companies going public in the United States so far this year, according to Dealogic - just behind UBS, but ahead of Credit Suisse and Bank of America's Merrill Lynch unit.\n\nMr Bao's rapid success reflects, in part, the shifting fortunes of Chinese IPOs in the United States. The market for such offerings had been frozen since mid-2011, when a spate of accounting fraud scandals and attacks by short-sellers drove several Chinese companies to delist from US markets.\n\nBut demand has returned this year because of a broad rally that has pushed US stock indexes to benchmark highs and propelled valuations for technology companies. Chinese companies have raised US$3.5 billion in new listings in the United States so far this year - more than the combined total from 2009 to 2013. Up next is Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant that is expected to raise as much as US$20 billion in one of the biggest IPOs in the history of US markets, perhaps as soon as September.\n\nWhile China Renaissance did not get a piece of the Alibaba IPO, it has been cashing in on a flurry of recent Chinese technology listings. Those include Weibo, China's answer to Twitter, which raised US$285 million in April, and also JD.com, Alibaba's closest competitor in the e-commerce space, which raised US$1.8 billion in May in the biggest US listing of a Chinese Internet company to date.\n\nHere again, relationships have been critical. Mr Bao first met JD.com's founder, Richard Liu, in 2007, soon after he had closed a bunch of traditional electronics shops in Beijing to start his online venture.\n\n\"I didn't see the incredibility when I first met him,\" Mr Bao said of Mr Liu, who is now 41. \"But he was so confident and convinced in his business that I thought, 'He must know something I don't'.\"\n\nMr Bao kept in touch and has worked with JD.com (formerly 360buy.com), on most of its fundraising deals in the past seven years. That included a US$215 million transaction in March to sell a 15 per cent stake in the company to Tencent, a giant Chinese social messaging and online video gaming company. Since going public in May, JD.com's shares have risen about 45 per cent, and Mr Liu's stake in the firm is worth about US$8 billion.\n\n\"The vision of China Renaissance is really to identify these top entrepreneurs and build a relationship with them early on and grow with them,\" Mr Bao said.\n\nA diminutive 43-year-old who trains in mixed martial arts and prefers designer shirts open at the collar to ties, Mr Bao was born in Shanghai to parents who worked in the government service.\n\n\"Nothing senior, I'm not one of the princelings,\" he is quick to add, referring to the children of China's political and business elite.\n\nHe left China in 1990 to earn a master's degree in economics in Norway and worked at Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley in London and New York before moving to Hong Kong in the late 1990s, where he focused on companies in the technology, media and telecommunications sectors.\n\nIn 2000, he left Morgan Stanley to become the head strategist at AsiaInfo, a software maker that became one of China's earliest technology companies to list in the US. At AsiaInfo, he immersed himself in the nascent start-up community that was beginning to emerge in China, expanding his circle of friends among budding entrepreneurs.\n\n\"These guys were smart, nimble and supermotivated, and a lot of that is carry-over from Silicon Valley culture,\" he said. \"They all had needs on the corporate finance front. But they were too small, and the big banks couldn't be bothered with them. I saw an opportunity to befriend these entrepreneurs and get in bed with them early on.\"\n\nSo in 2004, Mr Bao decided to set out on his own and start China Renaissance, mostly arranging small private financing deals for companies attracting their early rounds of venture-capital financing.\n\n\"The firm has hustled its way to a prominent position - not easy in the earlier days in the face of competition from the bigger banks,\" said Duncan Clark, who worked with Mr Bao in the 1990s at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong and who is now the chairman of BDA China, a consulting firm in Beijing that focuses on the digital and consumer sectors. \"But then, boutiques can find deals that are below the minimum size of the bulge-bracket firms and can be quite profitable,\" he added.\n\nMr Bao characterises his firm's focus as technology in a broad sense, concentrating on companies that will thrive in China's \"new economy\" - one that is driven by the adoption of digital innovations that are shaking up traditional industries such as retailing, education, health care and logistics, among others.\n\n\"If you want to invest in China, there's nothing else to invest in other than these technology companies because everything else is dead,\" Mr Bao says. \"Only the technology companies are growing.\"\n\nThat includes firms such as BitAuto Holdings, an online media company that provides nationwide information on car prices at different dealerships, as well as industry news and reviews. In 2007, China Renaissance helped the firm bring in US$15 million in financing from investors that included DCM, a venture-capital firm based in Silicon Valley and Beijing. BitAuto went public in the US in 2010, and its shares have since quintupled.\n\n\"Smart, intelligent, hard-working investment bankers are a dime a dozen - what sets him apart is his lively personality,\" said David Chao, a co-founder and general partner at DCM, who has known Mr Bao for years. \"This is why his Rolodex is great, because he is well liked,\" Mr Chao said.\n\nMr Bao's affability can't hurt when it comes to winning deals. But he dismisses the idea that there's anything sudden or spontaneous to his current success in taking companies public.\n\n\"You could say we started only last year, but you could also say we started 10 years ago,\" he says. \"This is really a monetisation of all the years of investment in our relationships.\" - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

Partway down Terminal B, the moving sidewalk that used to lead to a dozen gates now stops abruptly at a plain gray wall.\n\nPittsburgh's airport is struggling financially and mired in debt, with sharply lower traffic ever since US Airways began phasing it out as a bustling hub in 2004. Long gone are the days when British Airways flew 747s to London and TWA flew to Frankfurt from Pittsburgh.\n\nFor salvation, airport officials are looking down - about 1,800 metres.

The record production is a result of the ramped-up production capacity from its new gold refinery and its new leach yard. Leaching is a way of extracting gold by using chemical agents.\n\nThe company now has a targeted combined capacity of a million tonnes of ore.\n\nThe company's revenue jumped more than three times from a year ago to US$8.27 million, against US$2.22 million. The results were partly offset by the lower average realised gold price, which stood at US$1,277 per ounce, down from US$1,419 per ounce, said CNMC's chief financial officer Charles Cheam.\n\nTotal operating expenses doubled to US$4.37 million from US$2.1 million; this was attributed to higher site and factory expenses, as well as depreciation and amortisation.\n\nCNMC also reports its all-in costs, a cost metric recommended by the World Gold Council for gold-mining companies. This is a non-GAAP measure, meaning it is not guided by usual accounting principles. CNMC's all-in costs include its costs of mining-related work and exploration. This fell 41 per cent from a year ago to US$649 per ounce of gold sold, as a result of economies of sales, with production volume having gone up more than five times from a year ago, said Mr Cheam.\n\nWith the ramp-up in production, the company recorded higher capital expenditure a year ago.\n\nCNMC is testing a crushing system - used to break down the rocks from which gold is extracted - that should help to raise cost efficiency, said Mr Lim. The trial run should be completed by the third quarter.\n\nThe company has indicated that it will not pursue a tin-mining project in the Malaysian state of Perak following exploration work.\n\nFor the six months, the Catalist listing reported a net profit of US$5.7 million, swinging into the black from a loss of US$622,531 in the year-ago period.\n\nThe company has declared a dividend of 0.15 Singapore cents per share for the quarter. Its shares closed unchanged yesterday at S$0.305.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is behind the three Singapore banks, but is the largest financial services group and largest company by market capitalisation in Malaysia.\n\nThe seeds of its private wealth business were sown more than two years ago, in line with its push to provide its customers with a complete range of services, Mr Lee said in a recent interview.\n\nSingapore is the right place to launch the business as it is the centre of excellence for several of the group's products, including its credit cards, and asset and wealth management, he said.\n\nThe private bank unit, launched last November, has 35 relationship managers, several of whom were \"upskilled\" from affluent banking. They are supported by product and research specialists.\n\nMr Lee named unit trusts, bonds and equities as the most popular products among the bank's clients.\n\nThe bank is targeting clients with at least US$1 million in investable assets.\n\nIt now has US$3 billion in assets under management and aims to grow this to US$4.5 billion to US$5 billion by the year's end, he said.\n\nAs for the outlet the bank is planning to open in Orchard Road, Mr Lee indicated that it will reach out to affluent tourists from the region, especially those who come to Singapore for medical treatment.\n\nThe bank is not going after the clients of its rivals; instead it will focus on its own customer base, Mr Lee said.\n\nIt will work with its partner banks, such as Maybank Philippines International and Bank International Indonesia.\n\n\"We've always had the client base; we have affluent banking - in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia,\" he said.\n\n\"Our strategy is not to acquire market share in the beginning; we have enough to survive on just from the three countries,\" he said, adding that many customers have more than US$1 million in investable assets.\n\nPrivate bank customers will also come from the group's corporate and investment banking units.\n\n\"There are a lot of private individuals and traders at Kim Eng,\" he said.\n\nMaybank Kim Eng is a significant player in the region's corporate finance, debt, equity capital markets, derivatives, retail and institutional stock broking markets.\n\nIt ranked top in the Asean investment banking and advisory league table last year, cornering 8.9 per cent market share, reported international financial software company Dealogic.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The hospitality segment marked an 18 per cent rise in revenue to S$53.5 million on the back of higher occupancies registered at Fraser Suites Queens Gate in the UK, as well as Fraser Place Melbourne and Fraser Suites Perth in Australia.\n\nFor the first nine months of the fiscal year, FCL's revenue grew 58 per cent to S$1.7 billion, while net profit before fair-value change and exceptional items surged 62 per cent to S$346.2 million. After accounting for fair-value gains and exceptional items, net profit fell 38.6 per cent to S$300 million.\n\nCommenting on the stronger operational results, FCL chief executive Lim Ee Seng said: \"We undertook several key corporate actions that enabled the group to optimise capital productivity and strengthen our income base, as well as diversify our earnings across markets and increase recurring income.\"\n\nThis month, FCL's takeover offer for Australand turned unconditional after receiving sufficient valid acceptances for the A$4.48-a-share bid.\n\nUpon completion of the deal, FCL will see a substantial increase in asset and profit contribution from outside Singapore and greater recurring income, the group said.\n\nFCL derived gross proceeds of S$654.7 million from its injection of the six serviced residences into FHT, the S$1.67 billion portfolio of which includes six hotels from FCL's substantial shareholder, TCC Group. As part of its review, the group may divest suitable retail and office properties to FCT and Frasers Commercial Trust to optimise asset mix and yield, its spokesman said.\n\nDespite the slowing residential market here, FCL reckons that land-banking opportunities could still surface as the bids for government sites moderate.\n\nLast month, FCL acquired a 22,190 square metre executive condominium site in Sembawang Avenue through an 80-20 joint venture with Keong Hong Holdings. The plot is expected to yield around 620 residential units.\n\nAs at end-June, the group had unrecognised revenue of about S$1.9 billion and S$0.8 billion in Singapore and overseas respectively.

I can confidently say that Tata's and SIA's legendary hospitality standards and service excellence will make Vistara a natural choice for passengers.\"\n\nPhee Teik Yeoh, the chief executive of TSAL, added: \"Our core belief is that we will be intuitively thoughtful about our guests' needs from the time they contact us to the time they leave the airport ... We aim to build an emotional connect with our guests through service excellence delivered by the best people, supported by best-in-class technology and processes. Vistara will redefine industry standards and aim to be the finest full-service airline of choice.\"\n\nAnalysts have said, however, that Vistara is unlikely to contribute significantly to SIA's bottomline in the near term, since it will be restricted to just domestic flights in the first five years.\n\nSIA has a 49 per cent stake in the venture, with a US$49 million investment; Tata owns the rest with a US$51 million investment.\n\nAnalysts are expecting the airline to intensify the already-keen competition within India's aviation space, where incumbents are struggling to eke out a profit amid challenges such as high fuel taxes and limited infrastructure.\n\nIt has been estimated that Indian carriers will post collective losses of between US$1.3 billion and US$1.4 billion in FY2015, slightly less than the US$1.7 billion in red ink for FY2014.\n\nStill, despite the absence of immediate hefty profits, Vistara will fulfil a dream two decades in the making for Singapore's flagship carrier. SIA and Tata first tried - and failed - to start up their joint-venture airline in India in 1994; the Indian government of the day had then barred foreign airlines from holding stakes in domestic start-ups.\n\nIn 2000, however, as India was mulling the privatisation of unprofitable Air India, SIA and Tata once again joined hands to form a consortium, in the hope of buying into the ailing carrier and turning it around.\n\nBut a year later, in September 2001, SIA ditched this plan.\n\nIt was a case of \"third time lucky\" for SIA and Tata, thanks to India's sudden and unexpected decision in September 2012 to allow foreign carriers to own up to a 49 per cent stake in start-ups.\n\nThis prompted Malaysia's AirAsia to set up a joint venture with Tata early last year to run a low-cost airline.\n\nVistara is distinct from that in that it is the first full-service offering operating out of India since the liberalisation of ownership rules.\n\nSwee Wah Mak, the director of TSAL and executive vice-president of Commercial in SIA, said: \"From a global investor's perspective, the Indian aviation sector has a lot of potential for growth and I am delighted that SIA now has a fruitful role to play here.\"\n\nSIA shares finished unchanged at S$9.80 yesterday; SIA 200 closed up 4 cents at S$9.85.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But while collateral requirements for contra trading, independent rules committees and minimum share prices will help to diffuse the impact of future debacles such as the 2013 penny stock collapse that sparked the consultation, the changes need to go further when it comes to actually trying to prevent another incident.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Singapore Exchange (SGX) this month responded to a February public consultation in which the regulators proposed numerous changes to the way securities are listed and traded in Singapore. The changes are generally positive, but they are mostly focused on treating the symptoms of a major incident rather than actually preventing the event in the first place.\n\nFor example, collateral requirements for the practice of contra trading - or buying and selling shares before trades are settled - are an important step in ensuring that investors are not over-leveraged and exposed to trades that go south. Requiring brokers to disseminate trading restrictions that are imposed on individual stocks will also eliminate one form of information asymmetry that has benefited only insiders.\n\nWith retail investors often the ones hardest hit when a negative market event blows up, such changes are necessary and important in limiting the damage to the public.\n\nBut what regulators need to also do is to clearly address the issue of prevention. Could the penny stock collapse of 2013 have been averted in the first place if surveillance and enforcement were better? When the new rules on the reporting of aggregate short positions take effect, can we have confidence that traders will report those positions accurately? Beyond enforcement, the current rules also need to be examined in terms of how much they disincentivise questionable and wrong behaviour. One positive step in that direction is the proposal to set up independent committees that can impose fines on companies that breach certain rules. The prospect of a hefty fine could deter potential wrongdoers.\n\nBut once again, the proposed rules need bite to accompany the bark. The deterrence of a potential fine only works if the perpetrator faces a real threat of being caught. MAS and SGX should be applauded for a timely, and on the whole positive, reaction to the events of 2013. The rule changes that are on the way will mostly move our securities markets in the right direction. But the regulators should perhaps pay more attention to preventing a fire in the first place rather than putting it out after it has flared.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

I work well with your team. You just focus on your mission, focus on your health, focus on your ministry and your family. You know, if there's any problem, I would tell you, I would contact you.' So that was the assurance he has given me throughout the years, not once but on many occasions,\" said Kong.\n\nDescribing Mr Foong as \"the man in charge\" of the church's financials, Kong said the church would seek the auditor's advice on small matters like a S$5 donation to tax exemption issues and matters like using the church's building funds for rental payments.\n\n\"Unless he (Mr Foong) okays it, I would be very hesitant to proceed,\" said Kong.\n\nThe church founder, who turns 50 this year, also testified that the church had retained Senior Counsel Jimmy Yim of Drew & Napier for several years, in a bid to strengthen the organisation's corporate governance as it grew from a small setting to one of Singapore's mega-churches.\n\nThe checking of scripts for the church's annual general meetings was one of the things on which Kong would seek Mr Yim's and Mr Foong's advice.\n\nWhen asked by his lawyer Edwin Tong whether the special audit of the church's books was communicated to the executive members, Kong said he persuaded Mr Foong to record a video declaring that no church fund was used to promote Ms Ho's career.\n\nThe special audit was commissioned in 2003, after a then-church member, Roland Poon, alleged that the church forced its members to purchase Ms Ho's music albums and that the management had used the building fund to promote her albums, among other things.\n\nDuring the hearing, Kong also testified that he entrusted his deputies with the church's affairs as it grew in size, as he was overseas most of the time.\n\nThe court also heard how the church's Crossover Project, aimed at evangelising non-church goers through secular music, was successful and supported by members.\n\nMr Tong had said in his opening address that the crux of the prosecution's case was that the building fund monies could not be used for the Crossover Project, but he pointed out that it was a \"legitimate, proper and widely supported church purpose\".\n\nMr Tong argued that there was \"no wrongful gain\" in the case, \"no financial loss caused to the church\", and that the Xtron and Firna bonds were redeemed with interest.\n\nEarlier in the day, prosecutor Christopher Ong raised concerns of a possible satellite litigation that might \"unduly delay or disrupt the progress of the trial\".\n\nThis came after the church's current lawyer, Desmond Ong, sent a warning letter, citing possibility of injunction, to one of the accused, Chew Eng Han, who was the church's investment manager.\n\nIn the letter, Mr Desmond Ong had asserted that Chew is in possession of documents over which his clients claim legal privilege. Previously, Chew said he wanted to use those documents in his cross-examination of Kong.\n\nWhile the nature of the documents was not specified, the court has ordered Mr Desmond Ong to make his submissions on this in open court.\n\nThe trial continues.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Ms Sison, who works for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), operates out of an office at Newark's Terminal B, the international arrivals terminal, in a secure area not far from where arriving passengers have to show their passports and are treated to CDC-sponsored video monitors showing information about the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n\nIn some ways, she is an Ellis Island of the airways, charged with ensuring that immigrants are fit to enter the country. But while some people who were ill were held at Ellis Island, Ms Sison said, she does not hold people. If they need treatment, they may be quarantined, but only until they can be sent by ambulance to a hospital. There is a one-bed isolation room in her office, but it is no-frills, more like the school nurse's office than a space capsule.\n\nMs Sison, 36, who has degrees in chemistry and public health and is completing her doctorate in epidemiology at Rutgers University, took the post five years ago. She found out about it while working at the Newark city health department, on a measles case with the airport quarantine office.\n\nShe trains border protection officers on the disease du jour, so they know when to call her. In the case of Ebola, she has told them that the transmission is not airborne but that they should be alert for symptoms like fever, sweating and vomiting in travellers from West African countries like Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria. Less than 0.5 per cent of the 243,000 international travellers to US airports each day originate from those countries, including an average of 679 from Nigeria and 145 from the other three countries, according to the CDC.\n\nThe post can be busy even when there is not a major disease scare. Quarantine officers, who are not normally physicians, make 2,000 health consultations a year with CDC physicians about sick travellers, Kristen Nordlund, a spokeswoman for the agency, said.\n\nThe last big scare was MERS, or Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The first confirmed cases in the US were in May this year, in travellers from Saudi Arabia.\n\nAt the moment, Ms Sison said, the CDC's airport video terminals are flipping every few seconds between the latest exotic diseases: Ebola, MERS, measles and Chikungunya, a virus transmitted by mosquitoes that has been found in countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Indian and Pacific Oceans, as well as, for the first time last year, in Caribbean islands.\n\nUsually, sick travellers are glad to see her because they want help, Ms Sison said. The more combative passengers are the ones who are trying to bring in something that is precious to them but could carry disease, like monkey meat.\n\nPassengers from West African countries are not specifically targeted for Ebola checks, CDC officials said. \"We're not taking these passengers and doing anything differently,\" Ms Nordlund said. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

It previously secured US$28 million in funding in 2013\n\nand US$20 million early this year. This round of funding came from a group of investors including existing investors such as Rocket Internet - Foodpanda's parent incubator firm.\n\nSpeaking with regards to the new round of funding, Ralf Wenzel, global managing director of Foodpanda, said: \"We are very pleased by the sign of confidence and the acknowledgment of our current success.\"\n\n\"The new funding will be invested in continuous growth in our existing markets, by partnering with even more restaurants in more cities and further improving customer service.\"\n\nThe homegrown brand is already one of the leading online food delivery firms, offering services to over 40 countries over the world. It is one of the fastest expanding startup under its German incubator firm.\n\nFoodpanda's concept is a simple one - an online service, offered via website and mobile application, where customers can search for restaurants and place an order. Foodpanda then sends the order directly to the restaurant, which then delivers the meal to the customer. To generate revenue, Foodpanda takes a percentage success fee - a cut out of every order made via their online platforms.\n\nCompetitor, Delivery Club, was also recently acquired by the Foodpanda group, making it the leading food delivery site in Russia.\n\nGiven the recent spate of events surrounding Russia, it seems unusual for businesses to venture into the market. The country has been sanctioned heavily following an ongoing conflict involving Ukraine.\n\nHowever, Foodpanda is not fazed.\n\n\"The sanctions imposed by Russia will not have any impact on our business since we are not exporting or importing any goods but, rather, focus on providing a smooth and hassle-free food delivery service to customers and restaurants within Russia.\" Chinmay Malaviya, managing director of Foodpanda Singapore and Hong Kong, explained through an e-mail interview.\n\nEntrance into the Russian market should not be taken to mean that further expansion plans are right around the corner. In fact, expansion seems to have taken a backseat for now.\n\nMr Malaviya said: \"Currently, Foodpanda operates in more than 40 countries across four continents and instead of focusing on just expanding to more countries, we plan to position ourselves as the market leader in our existing markets by various approaches . . . and ultimately to further strengthen and uphold the identity of Foodpanda as the online marketplace for restaurants and a trustable online food ordering platform to customers.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It plans to keep half of that for Coutts & Co, its private banking unit, and most of the other employees will move to Lincoln House in the eastern district of Quarry Bay, where RBS already leases space, by the end of the year, they said.\n\nOffice rents in Central, where banks such as HSBC Holdings Plc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc have their regional headquarters, are falling as foreign financial firms continue to downsize or relocate to cut costs. Tenants in the city on three-year leases expiring this year may be able to negotiate on average rents that are 20 per cent lower than current leases, according to Cushman & Wakefield Inc.\n\nAlexander Chu, the Edinburgh-based bank's country executive for Hong Kong, declined to comment on the move.\n\nRents in grade-A office buildings fell 1.8 per cent in the first half and may decline 3 per cent this year, according to a Cushman report last month. Rents in the greater Central area, which slid 0.5 per cent this year, will remain stable for the next six months as demand is supported by mainland Chinese financial firms and smaller tenants, it said.\n\nGrade-A office rents in greater Central were HK$96.30 (S$15.50) per square foot a month in the second quarter, compared with HK$45.20 a square foot in Hong Kong East, where Lincoln House is located, according to data from Cushman. AIA Central was developed by AIA International Ltd and Lai Sun Development Co Lincoln House, which also has Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd and Lenovo Group Ltd as tenants, is owned by Swire Properties Ltd.\n\nRBS, the UK's largest state-owned lender, is shrinking its investment-banking units around the world as it strives to revive profits. The UK government owns a majority of the bank after its bailout during the global financial crisis.\n\nIn Asia, RBS has already sold most of its investment banking business in the region to CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Malaysia's second-largest bank by assets.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM", "images": []}

About 100 games are published each day,\" said Maxim de Wit, who leads international business for the Global Mobile Game Confederation (GMGC).\n\n\"The companies that have made a lot of money are looking to expand, and many of our members have asked for events to be organised in South-east Asia. They see the region as a convenient springboard out of China, with a long history of business done here, and a relatively smaller market (to tackle) compared with Western markets.\"\n\nGMGC organises an annual global mobile games developers' conference, and monthly gaming events throughout China. Mr De Wit, who is based in Beijing, said the events reach out to various players in the Chinese mobile games ecosystem, which include analytics companies, payment providers and messaging firms.\n\nGMGC was in Singapore in July with a delegation of Chinese developers, keen to explore the South-east Asian landscape.\n\nChinese developers targeting Western markets are keen to test their theories here, because of the relatively Western tastes in games here, said Mr De Wit. This includes casual games like \"Candy Crush Saga\" which have worked in Western markets, and are very popular in South-east Asia.\n\nAlso, compared with Chinese users who are more tolerant of badly placed ads, Western users are more likely to uninstall a game if an ad pops up at an inopportune time during the game, for instance, he said.\n\nChinese developers are also keen to test different monetisation models here. This includes figuring out the optimal price and mix of in-app purchases within free games, or whether a game should carry ads instead.\n\nNotwithstanding the overseas push, the Chinese games market is huge, with the potential audience growing every day as more and more people buy their first smartphones in the country, said Mr De Wit.\n\nAccording to Superdata Research, China's mobile games revenue is expected to reach US$3 billion this year, and is expected to cross US$3.2 billion next year.\n\nGartner's tracker shows China's smartphone sales grew 86.3 per cent in 2013, and IDC expects 420 million smartphones will be sold over 2014.\n\nMr De Wit noted that the Chinese market is too big for developers globally to ignore. He said that the first thing developers should figure out going into China is what the taste of the audience there is. Currently, card collection games like Blizzard's \"Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft\" do well, as well as casual games from Tencent.\n\nRole-playing games\n\nThere is a growing move towards role-playing games which are more demanding on phone hardware, because of the advancements in phone processors and improving 4G connectivity in China, he added.\n\nThe market is also heavily Android-dominated, at about 80 per cent of the smartphone market, so companies should funnel more investment and effort into prioritising Android first, compared with Western markets where most developers release iOS and Android at the same time, or iOS first, he said.\n\nFreemium does well, and local players are quite likely to pay for premium content in the games if they like the basic game. They are also fairly accepting of in-app advertising if it means they don't have to pay for the game.\n\nThe final, critical step to success is figuring out the right games publisher, said Mr De Wit. \"You should take your time to find the right publisher, and examine the agreement that it spells out clearly which entity takes care of which tasks in promoting the game,\" he said.\n\nUnlike Western markets, which rely on Google's official Play store, there is a multitude of third party app stores in China because of easier payment methods afforded by the latter group. This proliferation of app stores makes marketing a complicated task and a good publisher with a good game plan is needed to tap the market, he said.\n\n\"It is possible to be successful in China without physically being in China, but your publisher needs to be there. User acquisition and getting a game noticed can cost a lot of money,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Or did it signal that foreign investors are losing faith in Abenomics and are heading for the exit?\n\nAnalysts say this week should provide some answers to the question posed by the 3 per cent drop in Tokyo prices on a day when other markets were largely unchanged despite escalation of fighting in both Iraq and the Ukraine.\n\nWhat has set alarm bells ringing is the Bank of Japan's official acknowledgment last Friday after its policy board met that export prospects for Japan's still heavily export-dependent economy are not looking bright, at a time when domestic demand is still suffering from the impact of a consumption tax hike several months ago.\n\nGlobal investors poured into the Tokyo stock market some 18 months ago when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Liberal Democratic Party came to power, promising aggressive measures to boost Japan's long stagnant and deflation-ridden economy.\n\nMore piled in after Mr Abe appointed former Asian Development Bank president Haruhiko Kuroda as governor of the Bank of Japan. Mr Kuroda's massive monetary easing resulted in a 20 per cent depreciation of the yen against the dollar, setting the stage, it seemed, for an export boom in Japan.\n\nThe Nikkei 222 stock average duly soared by nearly 60 per cent in value in the year after Mr Abe arrived and what is particularly significant now, is that the percentage of all listed Japanese shares owned by foreign investors surged to over 30 per cent compared with 5 per cent in 1990.\n\nIf those investors should begin to lose faith now in Mr Abe's economic policies - known as \"Abenomics\" - the impact on the Tokyo stock market could be dramatic, some analysts suggest.\n\nThis is why, they add, last Friday's sudden drop in the Tokyo market is likely to create a good deal of nervousness this week until it becomes clearer how investors are going to react to last week's adverse news about Japan's immediate export prospects.\n\nToday marks the start of Japan's annual, ancestor-honouring O-bon holiday period, so stock trading by domestic investors could be light, which could exaggerate the impact of any sell-off by foreign investors who nowadays dominate trading activity in the market.\n\nThe Bank of Japan was careful to point out last Friday that it is not downgrading its overall assessment of Japan's economic prospects in the short to medium term and, at a special briefing for foreign media last week, officials of Japan's Ministry of Finance sought to strike an upbeat note about the economy.\n\n\"Japan's economy is expected to continue its moderate recovery as a trend,\" the BOJ said. \"The effects of the subsequent decline in demand following the front-loaded increase prior to the consumption tax hike are expected to wane gradually.\"\n\nMinistry of Finance officials meanwhile pointed to what they said were encouraging signs for the Japanese economy, including rising wage and bonus payments which they said should lead to increased personal consumption quite soon.\n\n\"Sales are coming back and GDP is expected to grow steadily,\" one official said. He also brushed aside concerns about the recent weakness in Japan's industrial output and argued that currently low business inventories should lead to an increase in industrial output in coming months.\n\nBut the BOJ and the finance ministry admit that \"structural changes\" in Japan's economy have had a more profound impact than expected. A good deal of manufacturing production has been shifted offshore in response to the strong yen, and the weaker yen now does not help boost exports in the way that it used to.\n\nMeanwhile, financial markets continue to doubt that the Bank of Japan will be able to achieve its targeted inflation goal of 2 per cent by next year, even though nearly two decades of deflation have now been replaced by annual consumer price inflation of around 1.25 per cent on average.\n\nThe fact that the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) still stands at around 0.5 per cent, when it should be nearer 2 per cent if the bond market believed that Mr Kuroda's inflation target will be met, shows a lack of market conviction in the BOJ's policies, analysts say.\n\nAs Tohru Sasaki, chief foreign exchange strategist at JP Morgan Chase Bank in Tokyo told The Business Times: \"There is a major disconnect between where the current long bond rate is and where it should be.\"\n\nThe stock market too, it appears, has begun to become more infected with doubts and this year the Nikkei average has given up some 20 per cent of the soaring gains it achieved after Mr Abe and Mr Kuroda took office.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Now nobody is saying that,\" said Mr Raymond.\n\n\"People will read articles on a watch. They may not read 300 articles, but people adapt quickly to technology.\"\n\nMr Raymond founded News Republic in France and has expanded to other European markets as well as North America and China, aggregating news from hundreds of outlets, including AFP, Al-Jazeera, Reuters and The Associated Press.\n\nRoman Karachinsky, CEO of the news aggregation app News360, also sees a future for wearables, but mainly for quick notifications they might not otherwise see.\n\n\"We want to change the formula from one where you go and seek information out to a world where information finds you when it's relevant and useful,\" Mr Karachinsky said.\n\nHe said the newly introduced Android Wear platform for Google allows for News360 alerts to be sent to some smartwatches, and to Google Glass.\n\nThese alerts fulfil a need of getting information out quickly - whether it is a sports score, stockmarket action or breaking news - in an unobtrusive way.\n\n\"Instead of digging around your pocket for your smartphone, now you can just look at your wrist or glance up to your Google Glass,\" said Mr Karachinsky. \"It's a very transformative experience.\"\n\nIt remains unclear at the moment how fast wearable technologies will catch on, and how people will use the devices. While News Republic's Mr Raymond sees a demand for full articles, he differs from News360 on Google Glass. But he said smartwatches may gain more traction when they become independent of smartphones, allowing people to shed their phones for some of the time.\n\nRoger Kay, analyst at Endpoint Technologies Associates, said news on smartwatches and Google Glass will probably be limited to short items that can be absorbed in a glance.\n\n\"The glanceability of it is important,\" Mr Kay said. \"I don't imagine people squinting at their watches to read articles; they have enough trouble reading on their phones.\" Still, he noted that \"a well-written headline can encapsulate an entire story\".\n\nFor news organisations struggling with the transition to digital, wearables may offer some help, analysts say.\n\nKen Doctor of the media research firm Outsell said news organisations may be able to bring in more readers with alerts tailored to their interests, by delivering through wearables.\n\nHe said major news organisations are now delivering millions of email alerts on important news to readers who register, and that this drives more traffic to the websites. The same could be true for alerts on wearables. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

The first concerns the social fabric of Singapore. Of late, there have been many differing opinions and perspectives from various camps on a host of different matters that underpin social norms and values.\n\nI hope the PM can offer his opinion on these phenomena as we progress as a society against a conservative background, and how the country could steer its course to avoid extreme polarising situations, which might be to the detriment of society.\n\nI believe PM will also talk about what is close to our hearts - the basic needs of all, specifically relating to health care, housing, and cost of living. With Singapore's ageing population, I wish to hear from him about his view of the outlook of a typical Singaporean retiree's life, in terms of financial wellbeing and medical care.\n\nI would also like to hear how he intends to address the issue of Singapore's ageing population, given the phenomenon of fewer marriages and a shrinking local core on the horizon, which makes the country unsustainable in the long run.\n\nI hope that the PM will also address the attitudes of the younger generation of Singaporeans.Globally, Gen Y has been getting a bad reputation for their attitude so I would like to hear how, as a country, we can help inculcate in our younger people a better attitude. These are the future leaders of Singapore and we need to ensure they are not only moulded for material success but also with the right values.\n\nAnd as our country approaches its 50th anniversary next year, I also want to hear about the PM's vision for the next phase of Singapore's growth story, beyond the next general election. How will Singapore society evolve and sustain itself in the next 50 years?\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nAS a country, Singapore is still in a transitional phase against the backdrop of a rapidly changing global and business environment. Various pillars of our society have therefore undergone major changes in recent years in a bid to maintain our competitive edge.\n\nIn the upcoming National Day Rally, I hope the Prime Minister will go beyond outlining what the government has done for its people and reassuring the public of the country's future in broad strokes. I would like to see more of a blueprint of how we are going to ensure Singapore's success in the years to come.\n\nFor starters, what else will be done to finally stabilise the economic restructuring we have been going through?\n\nNext, the rally should address the needs of Singaporeans for stronger social safety nets. It should touch on what more will be done to stabilise the property market to ensure that homes are affordable for all, especially the lower income segment.\n\nHealth care is another area of high priority. I believe the PM will touch on the new Medishield Life and I also hope to see what else will be done to tackle the issue of Singapore's ageing population.\n\nWith Singapore's changing demographics, the question of the Singaporean identity has emerged. With a lot more foreigners in our midst in recent years, what will be done to ensure social cohesion and a unified Singaporean identity?\n\nI believe these are a few of the themes that will continue to be important concerns in the next few years.\n\nLaletha Nithiyanandan\n\nManaging Director\n\nTalent Design Potential\n\nTHIS year's National Day Rally speech should focus more on the future instead of how far we have come.\n\nSpecifically I would like our leader to acknowledge that his government needs to transition from playing the role of custodian to embracing a more collaborative and inclusive style of government.\n\nTell us how he is building a comprehensive plan to get his leaders to focus more on building a Singapore Community, rather than Singapore Inc. Share the blueprint on how his government will focus on simplifying policies that affect the majority of citizens - such as CPF.\n\nAnd tell us how they will be proactive in reviewing current policies that are biased towards monetary gains only.\n\nAnd not least, build up a national agenda for critical conversations with citizens and also to act quickly on important issues such as health care, welfare, job creation and cost of living.\n\nPeh Kim Choo\n\nDirector\n\nHua Mei Centre for Successful Ageing (an initiative of Tsao Foundation)\n\nLONGEVITY in Singapore, among the world's highest, reflects our hard-won progress as a society. The government awards it in the Pioneer Generation Package, and there is cause for not just elders but everyone of us to celebrate.\n\nFrom acknowledging the contributions of our elders, we start the mindset change towards counting all the opportunities that ageing provides rather than takes away from us.\n\nWhat I wish for our elders and our society is a movement to recognise and honour the critical role that older people play as transmitters of values and culture, and their contributions as mentors in the family, community and workplace.\n\nWe need to dare to dream of a home where every age can flourish and benefit from longevity. I hope that we can together create a space for the dreaming to materialise.\n\nKaren Reddington\n\nRegional Vice-President, South Pacific\n\nFedEx Express\n\nAS we approach the 49th National Day Rally, minds will inevitably cast ahead to the country's landmark 50th anniversary, in what will be both a celebration and crossroads for Singapore. Current figures show that growth is tracking at between 2% and 4%, and it is steady growth that is the holy grail for any economy.\n\nWe need to focus on removing barriers to trade in order to maintain Singapore's economic trajectory, and fan the flames of long-term growth, a large part of which will be delivered by SMEs.\n\nAt the same time, the issue of productivity needs addressing. A careful blend of incentives and policy will be required in order to promote productivity more aggressively and ensure that Singapore remains competitive in the face of future economic headwinds.\n\nMaintaining a focus on growing Singapore's SMEs, combined with greater productivity, will deliver to Singapore the robust platform it needs in order to build on the legacy that was delivered by the nation's founding fathers.\n\nChris Comer\n\nCEO and Property Developer\n\nCastlewood Group\n\nIN view of the recently launched Pioneer Generation Package (PGP), a related issue will be on most people's minds - what more is being done to make retirement affordable?\n\nWith the rising cost of living, it is more and more difficult to maintain a lifestyle, even more so if your income is fixed, as the buying power of your dollar becomes weaker - is even a million dollars enough to retire in Singapore?\n\nWhile the PGP provides a safety net for retirees who will likely see an increased frequency of medical-related bills as they age, health care is only one aspect of the multi-faceted situations the elderly face. So a discussion on how property can be made affordable for retirees would be welcomed by all.\n\nAs property cooling measures are beginning to take effect, attention should be turned to the elderly and what is being done for their housing. In many cases, seniors live alone.\n\nRetirement communities should earn a place on the rally agenda in terms of providing financial assistance to enable the aged to gain access to these living spaces. Senior living facilities can meet the elderly's housing needs, and offer them some much-needed companionship.\n\nSingapore's rapidly ageing population has been a major talking point for the best part of the year, and as we reflect on our past successes as a nation, it is time for us to present a solution to our ever-changing socio-economic needs for the years to come.\n\nDavid Leong\n\nManaging Director\n\nPeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd\n\nEVERY National Day, there will be an anticipatory mood among Singaporeans as the Prime Minister sets the tone and direction of government policies, plus spell out some giveaways and takeaways. Over the last year, the government has rolled out programmes for the pioneer generation.\n\nThis year, in his ''state of the union'' address, I hope that PM can define the new social compact with Singaporeans - how this government sees its relationship with the people.\n\nThe demands of the people on housing, transport, healthcare and education are becoming varied and diverse; how can the government string together this diversity to forge a common goal with Singaporeans.\n\nDespite all the adjustments to its policies in transport, housing, health care and education, Singaporeans are still clamouring for more.\n\nNot only that, they are asking for more civil and political freedom, from gay rights advocacy to how the National Library should choose its books.\n\nThe government must set the tone and rationale of its policies and not be seen as responding in an arbitrary, random, passive and reactionary way.\n\nI hope PM can spell out in clear and unambiguous terms how it intends to deal with such issues and how it wants Singaporeans to align themselves with the national agenda for the good of Singapore. Enough never seems enough for Singaporeans.\n\nJoshua Soh\n\nCountry Manager\n\nCisco in Singapore\n\nIF we take a moment to think about what Singapore has achieved over the last 49 years - how our society has progressed and what we have accomplished - it really is incredible.\n\nLet us not forget where we have come from. Instead, let us appreciate our fellow citizens and residents who are working hard to drive our future, together.\n\nThe world as we know it is changing every day, and the most important thing for us as a country is to be part of the transformation.\n\nI would like to see the National Day Rally address how Singaporeans and businesses can lift the game so we compete better in the global, inter-connected economy.\n\nLet our 5C's be: support for all our communities; a collaborative workforce using flexible work arrangements; the co-development of innovative solutions; care and respect for our fellow Singaporeans; and the capitalisation of our strengths to make Singapore our home in our hearts and secure our future.\n\nRobin C Lee\n\nGroup COO\n\nBok Seng Group\n\nPLENTY has been done to take care of our senior Singaporeans and assure them that the government has their interests at heart. The introduction of the Pioneer Generation Package and the Medishield initiatives are definitely a move in the right direction.\n\nLet's come back to the much deliberated question of 6.9 million population for Singapore. I believe that this is something that the leadership has put in a whole lot of thoughtful deliberation for the longest time. Although debate on the topic seems to have lost steam somewhat after the initial reactions, it's something that needs to be confronted earlier than later.\n\nIt's not just an economics issue but also very much a social one. To be a vibrant and sustainable city, we need a large enough population to churn out the economic activities to support this resource-deficient country.\n\nIn my view, just looking at all the infrastructure being planned and the construction work underway, we're all set to go. The issues that need to be addressed sooner rather than later are how do we absorb the population surge while maintaining social cohesiveness?\n\nHow do we create hinterlands that Singaporeans can retreat to when they are done fighting in the high-stress, high-cost arena of this city?\n\nAs more qualified and wealthier people arrive, how do we ensure that any further widening of the wealth gap be contained? I hope to see these key issues addressed.\n\nChris Mead\n\nRegional Director\n\nHays in Singapore & Malaysia\n\nMANY employers in Singapore tell us that skill shortages remain an issue and this is likely to limit the country's potential for economic growth in the future.\n\nThe government's decision to push companies to consider locals above foreigners is good for the Singapore economy as a whole, but overseas talent is still needed to fill vacancies where local Singaporeans are in short supply.\n\nWe are seeing strong demand for local profiles which is creating a lot of competition for local talent. We expect the shortage of highly skilled professionals to continue so it is critical that Singapore matches the skills of young people with the skills needed in the economy.\n\nBy expanding the output and quality of the local education system Singapore can better meet the skills employers want. The supply of people with the right skills is the foundation for every successful organisation and finding the right person for a job makes businesses, economies and societies stronger.\n\nStephen McNulty\n\nManaging Director - Asia-Pacific and Japan\n\nProgress Software\n\nWITH a robust local startup and software developers' community, the government should facilitate and address the need for a software ecosystem that encourages creative and innovative use of technology across all sectors.\n\nSingapore has been making good progress towards realising the iN2015 vision - it is now time for the government and industry players to think of the nation's ICT strategy and direction beyond the 2015 deadline.\n\nIDA data shows business broadband adoption and households' Internet penetration exceeding 85 per cent in 2013, and expected to continue to grow in the next few years.\n\nAs Singapore's Smart Nation vision was unveiled in June, now is the time for the government to discuss the road ahead for the ICT industry and where the country foresees itself to be in the next 10 years.\n\nIn line with the iN2015 vision and to promote innovative use of cloud platforms, Progress is focused on working with educational institutions and enterprises to encourage creativity.\n\nWong Heng Chew\n\nPresident\n\nFujitsu Singapore\n\nEVER since Singapore embarked on its plans to be the world's first Smart Nation, there have been reports on different initiatives, such as the test bed at Jurong Lake District and the IoT@Home initiative.\n\nAs Fujitsu has always envisioned a future world where ICT is human-centric, these developments have been of particular interest to us. To help create a better standard of living for the elderly, Fujitsu developed a prototype of the Next Generation Cane, a smart walking stick designed to provide directions and track the user's location during emergencies, while monitoring the user's health conditions, such as heart rate and temperature.\n\nAs Singapore works towards creating a comfortable and efficient environment for both the young and old, it would be interesting to get further insights on the opportunities available for existing businesses, and how these initiatives will impact businesses and their workers.\n\nAs technology continues to advance quickly, I believe there are many businesses that will be keen on helping Singapore attain its goal of becoming a Smart Nation.\n\nEric Hoh\n\nVice-President, Asia South & Korea Regions\n\nSymantec\n\nAS we celebrate another year of independence, it's prudent for us to keep in mind the link between Singapore's shift towards a knowledge-based economy and the need for information security. Security is a topic that's not often discussed unless it's for the wrong reasons.\n\nIn 2013 we saw a record number of mega data breaches worldwide, where there were eight incidents that each resulted in at least 10 million identities being exposed. High profile incidents of data breaches, information loss and online fraud also emphasise that we are all on the front lines of information security, and reinforcing the Personal Data and Protection Act is a positive first step towards safeguarding our private data.\n\nSymantec wishes Singapore a happy 49th National Day, and looks forward to many more years of supporting our nation's safety and prosperity by enabling confidence in a connected world.\n\nThirumalai Chandroo\n\nChairman/CEO\n\nModern Montessori International Group\n\nAS we welcome Singapore's 49th birthday, we commemorate the triumphs we have achieved and lessons learned from the struggles we overcame as a young nation.\n\nNow we stand on the global stage, alongside the world's powerhouses. Globalisation has achieved this for us. Singapore's open-door policy has created economic success in the last few decades.\n\nAs we look towards the future with optimism, we hope to see new inroads created for Singaporeans. Concerns about the high costs of living, declining birth rates and ageing population are the pressing issues of the day.\n\nThere is also the need to broaden employment opportunities for our young in rising industries such as the arts, new age technology and social media to keep up with an increasingly sophisticated and tech-savvy world.\n\nCurrently the Pioneer Generation benefits pay homage to the hands that built this nation and allay the concerns about rising healthcare costs . Ensuring the long-term wellbeing of our elderly is a priority for our government.\n\nAsia has emerged as a global economic engine and a key player in international politics. These shifts ultimately alter Asia's role with the world. How will the rise of Asian powers such as China and India affect Singapore's growth and its business prospects in the near future?\n\nIt will be good to hear about measures to enable local businesses thrive amid the growing external competition. As we progress as a regional hub of knowledge, this National Day is a time to reflect and to ensure that we will keep beating to the heartbeat of success for many more years to come.\n\nLeong Soo Yee\n\nSingapore Head\n\nACCA\n\nA CONSTANTLY evolving economy and a more complex economic landscape mean that more demands will be placed on the Singapore labour market to provide a wider range of skills and competencies in order for us to retain our global competitive edge.\n\nAdvances in technology mean that higher education is now more accessible, via online or distance learning.\n\nInnovative study concepts such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have brought opportunities to many people, both graduates and non-graduates, who want to upgrade their professional knowledge, skills and abilities to reach their full potential. The cost-effective nature and online format provide flexibility and accessibility for potential participants.\n\nHowever, qualifications are not enough. Professionals of the future will need to possess a combination of both practical and theoretical skills in order to adapt and overcome the challenges of today's global economic landscape.\n\nWe look forward to new and innovative models of how we can integrate the study and work environments so that our youth will be better prepared to be the leaders of tomorrow.\n\nLee Fook Chiew\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nInstitute of Singapore Chartered Accountants\n\nSINGAPORE has been restructuring its economy and making efforts to raise productivity levels through innovation. This is especially important in an increasingly globalised world where competition is intensifying and impacting more business sectors.\n\nAs the economy continues to restructure towards higher value activities, there is a need to ensure that companies, especially Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), continue to be supported to move up the innovation and productivity curve during the economic restructuring journey.\n\nThe government has rolled out initiatives to support the shift towards innovation and capability transformation. It would be a boon to the business community and accountancy profession for issues related to productivity and innovation to receive continued government attention and be addressed at the National Day Rally.\n\nAnnie Yap\n\nManaging Director\n\nAYP Associates Pte Ltd\n\nTHE idea of a wealth tax in Singapore so as to narrow the wealth divide between rich and poor Singaporeans could be a topic for discussion. Singapore's Gini coefficient - which is now at 0.478 - is one of the highest among the advanced economies.\n\nIt would be interesting to know how a possible wealth tax can be structured to close the growing wealth gap, yet ensure that Singapore remains attractive for high-earners and workers.\n\nAnother issue that can be addressed would be the shortage of staff in the services sector. Reasons why the service industry is not attractive include long hours and poor customer attitudes. Five years ago, GEMS (Go-the-extra mile for Service) was implemented to encourage service staff to improve customer service standards.\n\nIt might now be timely for us to also look at how Singaporeans can be better customers so that our service staff can feel appreciated and fulfilled about their work.\n\nMark Billington\n\nRegional Director, South-east Asia\n\nICAEW\n\nI HOPE to hear more about how the government will ensure that social mobility remains high on the agenda, and people from all walks of life are able to achieve their career goals and personal dreams.\n\nAs a leading knowledge economy, many opportunities will arise but people need to have the correct skills and expertise to take advantage of them. It is therefore important for the government to assist people to develop those skills - and encourage the education pathways to gain and certify them.\n\nIn our work globally, ICAEW champions opening access to the financially rewarding accountancy and finance sector to people from all backgrounds. We have learnt that not everyone has the opportunity to go to the right schools nor wants to take the traditional university route.\n\nTo this end, we recently embarked on a partnership with Singapore Polytechnic which offered diploma students a route to become chartered accountants.\n\nOur members come from different backgrounds but undertake the same rigorous certification path. They bring a valued diversity to the profession and are highly regarded by their employers.\n\nRick Scurfield\n\nSenior Vice-President and General Manager\n\nNetApp, Asia-Pacific\n\nTHIS August, Singapore celebrates its 49th year of independence since 1965. On this very special day, I would like to congratulate Singapore on the remarkable achievements it has accomplished thus far.\n\nFrom its humble beginnings to becoming one of Asia's strongest economies, Singapore has come a long way and is often modelled after by other countries.\n\nThe Republic has managed to carve out a niche for itself by investing heavily in its human capital; nurturing and building a high-performance workforce.\n\nWith its investments in the newest technologies and infrastructure towards improving the country's networked readiness I am confident that we will see the nation reaching greater heights as a world-class data-driven economy.\n\nTo the Little Red Dot that has earned its place in the world's stage - here's wishing you many congratulations and may you prosper always. Happy National Day.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This applies to Central Provident Fund (CPF) monies as well, unless you make a separate nomination.\n\nWe reproduce the rules below, together with a translation into plain English. Disclaimer: Translations are not exact and this is not legal advice.\n\nThese rules also do not apply to Muslims, whose estates are governed by Muslim law and the Syariah Court.\n\nOne key point to note is that your spouse and children take precedence over your parents, under intestacy law. Your children and spouse will split your assets with nothing left for dependent parents, if you do not make a will stating an alternative distribution.\n\nRule 1\n\nIf an intestate dies leaving a surviving spouse, no issue and no parent, the spouse shall be entitled to the whole of the estate.\n\nTranslation:\n\nIf you leave behind a spouse and no parents or children, your spouse gets everything.\n\nRule 2\n\nIf an intestate dies leaving a surviving spouse and issue, the spouse shall be entitled to one-half of the estate.\n\nTranslation:\n\nIf your spouse and children survive, your spouse gets half of your assets.

For the week, the index lost 56 points or 1.7 per cent.\n\nTurnover throughout the week has been low, disappointing to many but not really surprising since it has been low for several months now with no sign of improvement other than the spikes seen at the end of each month when the STI gets window-dressed.\n\nIn yesterday's session, volume was 1.5 billion units worth S$1.08 billion with the 30 index components contributing S$641 million or 59 per cent of the dollar volume. On July 31, when the STI was ramped up 19 points to 3,373, volume was 1.7 billion units worth S$1.7 billion. Since then, the STI has lost 2.5 per cent.\n\nAmong banks, OCBC has been in play lately, apparently because it completed its takeover of Hong Kong's Wing Hang Bank but more likely because traders, having already played with UOB and DBS, had switched their efforts to OCBC.\n\nIn yesterday's session though, OCBC fell seven cents to S$10.10 and DBS 33 cents to S$17.81 but UOB managed a five-cent rise to S$22.69.\n\nMacquarie Warrants (MW) said yesterday that the key messages that Macquarie Equities Research (MER) took home after an analyst and media briefing with DBS were a potential pick-up in trade finance volume, fewer concerns and more transparency on China exposures, good asset quality trends and gearing to higher rates, a comfortable funding position and supportive margin trends.\n\n\"MER believes that DBS could be a great story for the second half of the year. MER thinks that DBS is in a good strategic position to take market share, particularly in Transaction Banking and SME banking,\" said MW. \"MER has an outperform rating on DBS with a 12-month target price of S$19.\"\n\nIn its assessment of Singapore's economic outlook, DBS Group Research said yesterday in its Daily Breakfast Spread that while expectation of a gradual global recovery remains in place, recent data have been mixed.\n\n\"Demand from Asia and the West remains sluggish. Growth expectation for the US has been lowered. This is juxtaposed against a weak eurozone and a slowdown in China,\" said DBS.\n\n\"None of this bodes well for Singapore. The economy continues to be weighed down by the domestic restructuring and external uncertainties. Manufacturing is in doldrums but the services sector is the biggest risk. We expect full year GDP growth to register 3 per cent, which is below Singapore's medium-term potential growth rate of 4 per cent.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Aug 8, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE styling of Renault hatchbacks in general and the Clio in particular has been quirky, to say the least. But the latest edition of this French supermini is decidedly different. Facelifted to show off Renault's new brand identity, it is sharply distinctive.\n\nThe front end with its new almond-shaped headlamps now incorporates a bigger and bolder chrome logo set into a sleek black grille for contrast. The rear end is even neater, with its slim tail lights and pleasing proportions. In Clio RS form with the multi-coated Liquid Yellow pearlescent paintwork, it is even more striking.\n\nThe Renault Clio RS is the top-of-the-line Clio tweaked by Renault Sport or RS. In its latest iteration, the Clio RS introduces three new features not previously associated with the model - five doors, a 1.6-litre engine, and a dual clutch gearbox.\n\nFor the first time, the Clio RS is available as a five-door hatch. But it still looks like a sporty three-door model because the convenience offered by the extra two doors is not obvious with the concealed door handles.\n\nAnother first is the downsized turbo engine (from a naturally aspirated 2.0), as well as the pairing with a six-speed dual clutch transmission (from a manual gearbox) to drive the front wheels.\n\nThis engine from Nissan (Renault and the Japanese manufacturer are partners) is very strong despite its size. With maximum torque of 240 Newton-metres from just 1,750 rpm, it is so punchy that you can scarcely believe there are only 1,618 cubic centimetres. The only drawback is that a heavy right foot will elicit torque steer. Add a light steering and this may be fun for some but hairy for others. Immediate correction is required and it also means that one of the Clio RS's party tricks - launch control - can be a heart-thumping affair if you don't hang on to the wheel properly. But its playful nature also means it is an entertaining car that is perfectly suitable for track day.\n\nAn RS Drive button behind the gear lever offers three driving modes - Normal, Sport and Race. In Normal, the Clio RS is grown-up and well-behaved. Sport turns it into a bit of a bad boy, with the appropriate aural enhancement from the sound pipe, which transmits more of the engine noise into the cabin. Race is available only in manual transmission, which is accomplished using the somewhat flimsy paddle shifts. And because they are column-mounted, changing gears is not a mid-corner option.\n\nAn electronic limited slip differential reduces understeer in fast corners by \"micro braking\" the inside front wheel without reducing engine torque. And it does so before the traction control cuts in, thus increasing driving fun.\n\nThe Clio RS can be ordered in two trim levels with their respective chassis options - Sport or the more track-focused Cup, which is five mm lower and 15 per cent stiffer. In Cup setting, the Clio RS's suspension is superb. It is very firm but in true French tradition, never harsh, and you should be able to outcorner almost any other car in a corkscrew because the RS will take it flatter and faster.\n\nTogether with a telemetry system to monitor performance data and g-force, the Clio RS promises maximum fun on the circuit for minimal price. The latter shows up in the plasticky faux chrome. But the rest of the cabin makes up for it with tasteful details, like the leather upholstery with red stitching, red accents on the gear lever and air vents, and the familiar top marker on the steering to indicate the straight position.\n\nAdd its new styling and newfound useability and the affordable Renault Clio RS suddenly becomes a very interesting alternative.\n\nsamuelee@sph.com.sg\n\nSPECS\n\nRenault Clio RS\n\nEngine\n\n1,618cc turbocharged\n\nTransmission\n\n6-speed dual clutch\n\nMax power\n\n200 hp @ 6,000 rpm\n\nMax torque\n\n240 Nm @ 1,750 rpm\n\n0-100 kmh\n\n6.7 secs\n\nTop speed\n\n230 kmh\n\nCO2 emissions\n\n144 g/km\n\nAverage OMV\n\nfrom S$23,500\n\nPrice\n\nfrom S$147,999 (with COE)\n\nDistributor\n\nWearnes Automotive\n\nTel\n\n6471 3313\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Group executive chairman Teo Hong Lim tells The Business Times that Roxy is looking at office and residential projects in Australia, under-utilised hotels in Japan that can be optimised, and potential sites in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nWhile it has had no luck yet with the bidding for hotel sites in government land tenders, the group is still keen to add hospitality assets to its portfolio to generate more recurring income.

Her mum is a housewife, and \"we had home-cooked food everyday and we were definitely very well taken care of. Before my sister came along, mum was my playmate too\", recalls Ms Tan.\n\nIn 2009, together with two other friends, she stared Wheniwasfour, an online shop which retails accessories, T-shirts and tote bags, with designs inspired by childhood memories, such as the five stones game, Potong ice cream and the Hao Gong Ming or Good Citizen logo. The Hao Gong Ming textbooks were a staple in primary school, to teach students how to be good citizens.\n\nMs Tan now runs Wheniwasfour on her own, and her mum helps with some of the sewing. \"Most of the designs are based on my childhood memories, as well as other peoples' memories,\" says Ms Tan. \"Customers, friends and family often share with me what they have seen, used, played, eaten and experienced in the past.\"\n\nShe called her label Wheniwasfour, because, \"four is the age when most children start to have first impressions of the many things, people and places around them. I hope to bring back childhood memories through design and various handmade products\".\n\nMs Tan began with just brooches, but following feedback from customers, she has expanded the range to include magnets and keychains. \"I used to have only fancy gem biscuit brooches and rings, but customers will start to ask for earrings and necklaces as not all of them will wear pins, so I've added that to the collection as well.\"\n\nMost of the products are handmade by Ms Tan and her mother. Another friend and her mother helps Ms Tan with the clay products, such as the gem biscuit earrings. Other fabric products are outsourced to local sewing aunties. \"Many of the items are made locally, but products such as the tote bags are sewn and printed overseas,\" says Ms Tan.\n\nThe label's best-sellers are the snack pins, gem biscuit related items and the tote bags. Earrings cost S$14.90 while tote bags retail at S$24.\n\nMost of her customers are Singaporeans, who like reminiscing about their childhood days. \"They are not that popular with tourists, probably because they can't relate to the design of the items.\"\n\nFor this National Day, be a good citizen, and show some national pride by donning the Hao Gong Ming T-shirt, which retails for S$32.90.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But it's 9pm and there isn't a fruit stand open nearby, and it's too much work to pry open one - husks and all - anyway. What do you do?\n\nWell now, thankfully, there's Cocoloco. The svelte bottles of locally bottled fresh Thai coconut juice are the brainchild of young local couple Kelvin Ngian and Jun Hew, who want to make the trendy health drink more conveniently available to the masses.\n\nTheir coconut water tastes exactly like what you'd get from a fresh coconut, and is slightly sweeter than most other bottled labels of coconut water. That's because the water is tipped out of coconuts directly imported from Thailand and only filtered but not pasteurised before being bottled, says Mr Ngian. No sugar or artificial sweeteners are added. \"Some of the other coconut waters on the market have shelf lives of up to a year, which makes you wonder how much it's been treated,\" says the 30-year-old, who left his banking job to join his family's coconut import and wholesale business, Siam Coconuts, last year.\n\nNoting the recent increased interest in coconut water - the low-calorie, potassium-rich liquid is said to have anti-ageing, anti-carcinogenic properties - the idea to branch into coconut water was birthed shortly after, and bottle retail kicked off last month, says Mr Ngian. Ms Hew, 29, is a luxury jewellery marketeer by day and helps out with marketing efforts in her free time.\n\nCocoloco is bottled in Siam Coconut's processing plant in Aljunied on-demand, and are delivered on the same day. The bottles have been lab-tested and stay good for up to a week, though Mr Ngian recommends consuming them within three days.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

While they have yet to win the League, DBS Vickers has performed well each year, finishing 15th in 2010 out of 25 teams, 10th in 2011, 9th a year later and sixth last year in Category A. While Mr Lui believes that SunMoon and SPH Sultans of Swing are the teams to watch this year, his team will aim to finish in the top half of the table.

One moment, they were ruling the charts during the height of their popularity in the 1990s, and the next, egos and infighting led to their breakup in the new millennium.\n\nSo it becomes almost a feat for a band like Travis to still be around after almost 25 years together - without a single change in their line-up, at that. The secret to the Scottish quartet's longevity probably lies in the fact that they still very much enjoy one another's company and playing together as a band.\n\nThat bond was evident last Friday evening when they performed at The Star Performing Arts Centre as bassist Dougie Payne shared a light moment with guitarist Andy Dunlop on drummer Neil Primrose's riser while singer-frontman Fran Healy engaged the 2,000-strong crowd with his in-between-songs banter.\n\nIt also helps that the foursome haven't let fame go to their heads and have a reputation of being some of the nicest people in the music business. The show kicked off later than expected at 9.45pm because the interviews taking place backstage overran as Healy and Dunlop made sure everybody's questions were duly answered before they came on 45 minutes later than advertised.\n\nWhat makes it even more impressive is that they managed to remain so grounded despite the fact that they are one of the biggest-selling bands in the world, and paved the way for other Brit-pop clones like Snow Patrol, Keane and Coldplay, which Travis incidentally co-headlined a double bill with in 2001 at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.\n\nIt was the first time both bands played here and even though Coldplay has since overtaken Travis in terms of commercial success, its frontman Chris Martin never forgets the debt he owes and often refers to himself as \"the poor man's Fran Healy\" in interviews when comparisons between the two acts are made.\n\nWhile Coldplay has since returned to our shores only once, it was Travis's fourth time here. Touring on the back of last year's Where You Stand, their first album in half a decade, they opened with the mid-tempo Mother, a track off it before playing another four between a 21-song setlist that was heavy on their hits like Pipe Dreams, Driftwood, Love Will Come Through and Flowers in the Windows, which they performed acoustically with no amplification during the encore.\n\nWhile the new songs sometimes lack the immediate pop hooks of their stadium- sized anthems like Turn and Sing, it showed a new maturity in their songwriting. With all four members now fathers, it's only natural they would write songs about parenthood; like Where You Stand'sReminder, which Healy tells the crowd is a list of things he'd like his seven-year-old son to learn (\"Celebrate, don't be late / Finish what's on your plate / Figure out, don't forget / Only love, don't regret\").\n\nAs always, Travis closed the two-hour show with their signature hit, Why Does It Always Rain on Me, off their biggest-selling album, The Man Who (1999). Ironically, Happy from their debut Good Feeling (1997) appeared on the setlist as an encore but was not performed. Given the smiles that were seen all around when the house lights came on, nobody looked like they were about to complain.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Market observers, however, pointed to more company-specific factors, such as the upstream oil and gas sector being unfamiliar to investors in Singapore.\n\nIn a press briefing yesterday, Japfa's CEO Tan Yong Nang said the firm is here for the long term, and that \"it doesn't really matter\" if the share price moves 5-10 per cent in either direction upon listing.\n\n\"We believe we're a good company. For a good company, whether it is good times or bad times, there will be interest in you,\" he said. \"Frankly, we're farmers, we don't time the market.\"\n\nThe Singapore-headquartered firm is selling 248 million shares - comprising 231.2 million shares for its international offer and 16.8 million for the public offer - at 80 Sing cents a share. Earlier news reports had put the indicative price range between 75-87 Sing cents a share.\n\nJapfa revealed that it has received \"robust demand\" from institutional investors, receiving indications of interest amounting to about 5.1 times the international offer.\n\n\"We went through a proper price discovery process to come out with this price,\" said Mr Tan, adding that interest came from a \"balanced mix\" of investors including long-only funds and insurance firms.\n\nMarubeni Corp, the largest Japanese food commodities trader, will be an anchor investor, Bloomberg reported.\n\nIts current shareholders, the Santosa family in Indonesia, will remain the largest shareholder post-IPO, retaining a 77 per cent stake.\n\nJapfa produces milk, poultry and beef in Indonesia and has replicated the same industrial farming business model in Vietnam, Myanmar and India for poultry, and in China for dairy products.\n\nThe vertically integrated group uses its raw milk to produce fresh milk, UHT milk and cheeses under the \"Greenfields\" brand to consumers in Indonesia, where it holds about 38 per cent of the market by value as a market leader, and other countries such as Singapore, Hong Kong and the Philippines. It also makes processed meat products under the \"So Good\" and \"So Nice\" brands in Indonesia and \"So Yumm\" brand in Vietnam.\n\nThe group last year recorded a net profit attributable to shareholders of US$41.8 million, down 22 per cent from 2012's US$53.3 million. Revenue rose 16 per cent to US$2.7 billion.\n\nJapfa intends to use the net proceeds of S$187.3 million - assuming an over-allotment option is not exercised - to develop its China dairy business - where the group's profit margins are the highest - by building a second five-farm hub in Inner Mongolia. The funds raised will also go towards growing its business in China and the Indochina region and paying off borrowings, including pre-prepayment charges.\n\nGoing forward, the firm hopes to ride on the growth in Indonesia's middle class which it says will create a bigger appetite for meat and dairy products, and also to replicate its business model to other parts of Asia, in particular at the most profitable parts of the value chain. The consumer food segment, now just a small part of the group (the firm does not provide a breakdown by business segment), will be a key driver for future growth too, said Mr Tan.\n\n\"We want to be a pan-Asian company providing all sorts of animal protein food for the masses in Asia,\" he said.\n\nCredit Suisse (Singapore) and DBS Bank are the joint global coordinators and bookrunners for the deal. Credit Suisse will also be acting as the stabilising manager with the ability to buy up to 37.2 million shares, or 15 per cent of the total offer, in an over-allotment option should Japfa's share price fall.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And growth for the full year will be below last year's 4.1 per cent.\n\nIn his National Day Message last year, Mr Lee also announced a revision of the full-year growth forecast for 2013, from 1-3 per cent to 2.5-3.5 per cent. In any case, private-sector economists have come to expect Mr Lee to give an update of these economic numbers in his National Day Message. This year, they tipped him to narrow the range of the growth forecast.\n\nThe economists, who had projected full-year growth at around 3.8 per cent in 2014, saw the move coming after GDP growth tumbled by over half to 2.1 per cent in the second quarter, down from 4.7 per cent in the first quarter.\n\nCIMB's Song Seng Wun, UOB's Francis Tan and Mizuho's Vishnu Varathan expect growth contraints to remain in the months ahead. These include domestic headwinds from restructuring and credit pressures as well as geopolitical risks of the warfare and disease kinds.\n\nMr Song, who had correctly predicted that the full-year growth forecast would narrow to 2.5-3.5 per cent, pointed out yesterday that it's clear by now the European and American economies are not picking up as fast as expected.\n\nThe trade-dependent tech sector, which accounts for a third of manufacturing output, will continue to be a drag on the Singapore economy, he said. And the recent drop in Chinese tourists will only spell more bad news for the domestic services sector, which is already soft.\n\nWeaker growth in the United States, China and several key emerging economies has already led the International Monetary Fund last month to trim its 2014 global growth forecast to 3.4 per cent from 3.7 per cent. Still, 2.5-3.5 per cent growth is not bad - and the growth is needed to produce good jobs and fulfilling careers, according to Mr Lee in his National Day Message to Singaporeans. \"We must keep up this growth over the next decade to help you improve your lives.\"\n\nIn his message, Mr Lee also said that the government was studying how to make it more convenient for retirees to get cash out of their flats, \"in a prudent and sustainable way\". He said that he would speak about how to improve the Central Provident Fund at the National Day Rally next week, in particular, on how to make the CPF better in helping Singaporeans to save for old age.\n\nThe anxieties of the old and the aspirations of the young - these are two concerns that took up much of Mr Lee's National Day Message last night. And he pointed out the many efforts that the government is making to assist them.\n\nIn helping young Singaporeans to realise their potential, Mr Lee said that it was not just a matter of continuing education and training. \"It's also a matter of social values.\"\n\nSingaporeans should not judge a person by his paper qualifications, but also by his skills, contributions and character. \"This is how we keep Singapore a land of hope and opportunity for all,\" he said. \"We are now at a higher level, from which we can scale new heights. Hence, we must reassess our position, review our direction and refresh our strategies.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The former is a little plain for those who want a bit of kick in their workout drink, and the latter is unnecessary. \"It's like driving a Ferrari to the supermarket just to do grocery shopping,\" he says. \"You burn about 300-400 calories in a one-hour spin class, but you're consuming 200 calories from one bottle of energy drink - and it's full of chemicals.\"\n\nSo the 39-year-old decided to come up with a healthier in-between. He first started experimenting with cold-brewed teas - teas made by steeping them in room temperature water for two to 12 hours - which results in a smoother and sweeter taste, and retains more antioxidants, but the wait time proved too impractical his busy lifestyle.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In July, the counter peaked at S$10.34 and bottomed out at S$10.08.\n\nIts Hong Kong counterpart, Cathay Pacific, closed unchanged at HK$14.62 yesterday. Last month, its share price hit a high of HK$14.72, after reaching a low of HK$14.22. Down Under, Qantas Airways was up one Australian cent to A$1.30 yesterday. The month before, it hit a low of A$1.205 before rising to a high of A$1.335.\n\nEven as initial second-quarter results showed that airlines worldwide continued to improve their financial performance, a sample of five airlines from the Asia-Pacific region posted an operating profit of US$150 million, a decline from US$254 million in Q2 2013.\n\nThis, the report attributed to a combination of cargo revenue weakness, as well as increasing cost pressures for the Chinese carriers which have had to contend with a depreciating local currency.\n\nGlobally, air travel volumes, which have benefited from an \"improving demand environment\", are expected to have solid growth ahead, the report said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Now California's Sunset Strip is getting a new sound: the booms of buildings being demolished and new ones developed.\n\nKnown for its giant billboards, celebrity hot spots and rock clubs including the Whisky a Go Go and the Viper Room, Sunset Boulevard is getting a 21st century makeover. Some ageing landmarks, such as the House of Blues and Larry Flynt's Hustler Hollywood erotica store, are on their way out, to be replaced by luxury lodging by hoteliers including Ian Schrager.\n\nInvestors AECOM Capital, CIM Group and Schrager all have buildings with hotels planned for the Sunset Strip. The projects are part of a record number of developments along the 2.6 km stretch of Sunset Boulevard running through the city of West Hollywood, where hotel occupancies were among the highest in Los Angeles County last year.\n\n\"We like turnaround neighbourhoods,\" said Warren Wachsberger, vice-president of Los Angeles-based AECOM Capital, the investment arm of AECOM Technology Corp. \"If you look at the evolution of Sunset Boulevard, 10, 15 years ago, you couldn't move because of all the traffic. It was dirty and dangerous. Today, Sunset is a dramatically different place.\"\n\nAt Sunset near San Vicente Boulevard, Hustler Hollywood, which opened in 1998, is being sold to an undisclosed buyer, said Arthur Sando, vice-president of communications for Flynt Management Group. The store, which is relocating, may be torn down and replaced with a hotel, said John Keho, assistant director at West Hollywood's Community Development Department.\n\nHalf a block over, a Saudi Arabian company is \"close to breaking ground\" on a luxury hotel with about 190 rooms on a lot purchased for about US$30 million in 2012, said Tony Azzi, a Los Angeles-based broker with Marcus & Millichap. He wouldn't identify the company because of confidentiality agreements with his client.\n\nOn the eastern end of the Strip, as the West Hollywood portion of the boulevard is known, plans call for the House of Blues, which opened in 1994, to be torn down and replaced with a hotel-condo project.\n\nHotel occupancies in West Hollywood last year climbed 6.5 percentage points to 82 per cent. That compares with total occupancies of 77 per cent last year in the Los Angeles and Long Beach area, and 71 per cent statewide, according to STR Inc, a Hendersonville, Tennessee-based research firm.\n\nAECOM and developer Combined Properties are planning 149 hotel rooms, 40 condos, five rental units and an entertainment venue at the House of Blues site. They are scheduled to start building towards the end of 2015, with construction taking about two and a half years, said Marianne Lowenthal, executive vice-president of development for Washington-based Combined Properties. She wouldn't say how much the project will cost.\n\nAt Sunset and La Cienega Boulevard, CIM Group last year started to raze buildings including the Tiffany Theater, almost 50 years old at the time and once a filming location for the television series \"77 Sunset Strip\". Replacing them will be a four-building complex that will include the high-end James Los Angeles hotel as well as apartments, shops and restaurants. The hotel will open in 2016, the company said in March.\n\nSchrager and Bethesda, Maryland-based Marriott International are seeking to build a 148-room luxury Edition hotel, along with condos and stores, on the south-east corner of Sunset and Doheny Drive. The group is planning to submit final architectural plans for the site, once home to the upscale restaurant Scandia, in the next few months, according to Mr Keho of West Hollywood's development department.\n\nThe Sunset Strip developments planned or already being built \"easily amount to US$600 million or more,\" said Patrick Amos, a senior associate in Beverly Hills at brokerage CBRE Group. That's a record for the area, he said.\n\n\"This is the most construction activity we've seen on the Strip since 1984,\" Mr Keho said. \"We have several multi-storey buildings in the works, and we haven't seen that for decades.\" In the early 20th century, avocado groves covered what is now known as the Sunset Strip, before shops, restaurants and bars started to populate the boulevard beginning in the 1920s, according to the Sunset Strip Business Association, a non-profit group run by local business owners.\n\nOversight by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department - a more relaxed law-enforcement agency at the time than the LA Police Department - helped the Strip become one of the hottest entertainment spots in the country. Home to nightclubs including Ciro's and Mocambo, the Strip was frequented by such celebrities as Frank Sinatra, Marilyn Monroe and Humphrey Bogart, as well as mobsters Bugsy Siegel and Mickey Cohen.\n\nThe rock club Whisky A Go Go opened in the 1960s, and the Doors, fronted by Jim Morrison, spent time as the house band in 1966. Other late-night draws along the Strip include the Roxy Theatre, Rainbow Bar & Grill, Skybar at the Mondrian Los Angeles hotel, and the Viper Room, opened by actor Johnny Depp in 1993. Actor River Phoenix collapsed and died outside the club later that year.\n\n\"There is only one Sunset Boulevard,\" said Demitri Samaha, president of a Los Angeles-based developer. \"It is centrally located, between Beverly Hills and Hollywood. Sunset is like a landmark. As time goes by, it is a brand name that's here to stay.\"\n\nThe sudden influx of multi-storey projects is being met with some neighbourhood resistance. Groups such as Save Sunset Boulevard fear the \"Manhattanisation of the Sunset Strip\" will cause \"a terrible traffic situation, making local residents virtual prisoners in their own homes and seriously disrupting the lives of thousands of Sunset Boulevard commuters,\" Alex Rose, a member of the group, said in an e-mail.\n\n\"It is very important to keep the culture of Sunset alive,\" said Ian Schrager, who before creating boutique hotel chains was the co-founder of Manhattan's Studio 54 nightclub.\n\nThe Strip's geography, bordered by steep hillsides and residential properties, also complicates and increases the costs of large-scale commercial developments, according to Mr Amos of CBRE Group. In Hollywood, at the Strip's eastern border, a mixed-use apartment and retail project being built by Townscape Management may be slowed by resistance from West Hollywood and Los Angeles residents who oppose it, according to news website WEHOVille.\n\nAdded revenue from large-scale outdoor advertising may help motivate developers to overcome obstacles. The city is reviewing its billboard policies to streamline the approval process and allow for more creative billboards, Mr Keho said. AECOM and A J Khair plan to incorporate outdoor advertising at their projects.\n\nThe city of West Hollywood has tried to make Sunset Boulevard more attractive for both residents and developers in the past two years by adding trees, restricting the number of bank branches on the Strip and widening sidewalks at Sunset Plaza, an area with stores and outdoor cafes, Mr Keho said.\n\nHowever hard developing on the Strip may be, an increasing number of Sunset Boulevard landmarks probably will go the way of the Tiffany Theater and House of Blues, making way for glitzy hotels. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM", "images": []}

MAS lost more than RM4 billion between 2011 and last year. In the first quarter of this year, it lost a further RM443 million; its second-quarter numbers are expected to be worse.\n\nBad luck has worsened the haemorrhage. First, Flight MH370, bound for Beijing in early March, vanished without a trace and remains missing. Then last month, MH17 was shot down over civil war-plagued Ukraine en route from Amsterdam. These two incidents conspired to brand MAS as tragedy-prone and people began cancelling their bookings.\n\nWith morale ebbing, a privatisation at this stage would be an act of mercy, shielding the carrier from financial scrutiny amid what could be a brutal restructuring by Khazanah. The state agency said yesterday that its overhaul of the airline would take 6-12 months after shareholders give their approval.\n\nWith privatisation as a first step, Khazanah said it would unveil its \"full proposal\" for the airline by the end of August.\n\nIn a hint that it would not be all tea and sympathy, it said it would \"need cooperation from all parties to undertake the restructuring, covering the airline's operations, business model, finances, staffing and the regulatory environment\", and that \"nothing less\" would be required.\n\nMost analysts suspect a declaration of bankruptcy is in the offing. The airline needs to cut its 22,000 staff who, shielded by powerful unions, have proved less than sympathetic to reason. In contrast, Air- Asia, which is bigger by value and by fleet, has around 12,000 staff.\n\nMAS is also hampered by lopsided procurement contracts, which it inherited and which favour contractors who are politically connected. In its current form, the airline would find it legally difficult to break these contracts; after bankruptcy and a different corporate entity - MAS2, say - these matters would not arise.\n\nThere is also the matter of the airline's debt burden, which now stands at around RM12 billion. With the new entity, this too could be renegotiated.\n\nIndustry sources think Khazanah could change the airline's top management and bring in new people with the requisite experience from other airlines. This will probably become clearer by the end of the month.\n\nWhether Prime Minister Najib Razak will have the political will to empower Khazanah to make changes remains to be seen, but the language of the agency seems to suggest that major changes are intended - which could only mean that the premier has thrown his weight behind the agency. There seems little doubt that MAS shareholders will agree, however bitterly. Maybank analyst Mohsin Aziz urged them to \"go for it\" in a note yesterday, adding that a sum-of-parts valuation by his bank had placed the carrier's value at 25 sen a share.\n\nIn the end, it will boil down to meaningful and permanent cost cuts. Indar Dhaliwal, CLSA's aviation analyst, said: \"If it can cut costs and maintain its present load, it should turn around with no problems and become profitable.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The performance was better than in Q1.\n\nNeither survey director Chow Kit Boey nor private sector economists were surprised by this. Ms Chow chalked it up to recent improvements in the US economy, which has been shown in past studies on business cycles to have an impact on Singapore directly and indirectly.\n\nShe noted that in Q1, the US had severe weather affecting its economic performance; in Q2, it bounced back to grow 4 per cent - much better than earlier estimates.\n\nApart from the US, regional economies such as China and India have seen an improvement in industrial activity.\n\nExperts pointed out that business activity was relatively weak in Singapore as a result of rising business costs and the tight labour market.\n\nCIMB economist Song Seng Wun, who said the softening of visitor-arrival numbers in Singapore had hurt hospitality-related industries, added: \"Poor stockmarket sentiment didn't help either.\"\n\nMizuho economist Vishnu Varathan said the loan curbs could have weighed on companies' business activity at home: \"Lagged effects of credit tightening for mortgages and car loans may also be filtering through to ancillary domestic sectors, such as furniture or car grooming.\"\n\nIn line with the findings of the Economic Development Board and the Department of Statistics' recent business expectations surveys, the BT-UniSIM Business Climate Survey showed a brightening business outlook for the next six months among companies.\n\nThanks to more definitive signs of faster growth in the world's major economies, the business prospects net balance - the difference between the proportion of sanguine versus pessimistic responses - stood at 4 per cent in Q2, against one per cent in the previous quarter.\n\nAmong the most confident are companies in manufacturing and transport & communications; these two sectors also performed the best in Q2.\n\nMr Song said: \"There's a belief that things will get busier on the back of improving external demand, especially from developed economies. Changi Airport may have seen slower growth in passengers handled, but freight is recovering.\"\n\nMs Chow said logistics activities are expanding due to the growing e-commerce space, which augurs well for businesses in the transport & communications sector.\n\nThe findings of the survey, carried out between mid-June and mid-July, showed that sales and orders contracted less in Q2. The net balance for sales stood at -7 per cent (an increase of 3 percentage points), -21 per cent for profits (unchanged) and -3 per cent for orders/new business (a rise of 3 percentage points).\n\nThe above indicators tracked by the survey have been found to correlate to economic growth in the history of this survey; the business prospects indicator, lagging by a quarter, has shown the closest correlation to gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates.\n\nThe survey now predicts 4.4-5 per cent growth in Q3 GDP year-on-year - significantly higher than the consensus estimate of 3.9 per cent. The report with the survey, in analysing the figures, put 2014's GDP growth to be likely between 4 and 4.6 per cent - above both official and market forecasts of 2-4 per cent and 3.7 per cent respectively.\n\nUOB economist Francis Tan described the survey's Q3 growth estimate as being \"a little bit on the high side\", given the high base recorded in the second half of last year, when GDP growth stood at 4.9 per cent year-on-year.\n\nMr Varathan said: \"We estimate 4.1 per cent GDP growth in Q3, and 3.8 per cent for the full year. Admittedly, we're not as optimistic as the (BT-UniSIM) survey, but I'm inclined to agree with the direction of data surprise - (there could be) upside in store.\"\n\nEconomy watchers widely expect Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to narrow the government's full-year GDP forecast in his National Day Message this evening, but were divided on what the new range would be.\n\nMr Varathan said it will be tightened to 2-3.5 per cent; CIMB's Mr Song reckoned 2.5-3.5 per cent was likely, while UOB's Mr Tan said he was anticipating 3-4 per cent. Still, all three economists identified constraints to growth in the months ahead - these include domestic headwinds from restructuring and credit pressures as well as geopolitical risks - whether from military warfare or disease outbreaks.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The mobile call app, created by a local startup, allows consumers to make calls for free to landlines or mobile phones in return for listening to a short audio advertisement while waiting for the call to be answered. This is not the first encroachment on telco territory, but it is a larger one. Nanu works on any network, including 2G ones, unlike players such as Skype or Viber.\n\nSince the onslaught of services delivered over the Internet such as WhatsApp and Line, operators have put up a brave front. Some have insisted that the reliability and quality of their own connections will see them through. In short, they can do this better. The problem is, the operators are in an environment where \"better\" is not good enough. In fact, better is worse than \"not good enough\"; it is irrelevant. Outside the enterprise space, people will put up with a lot if a service is free.\n\nConsumers also place a lower marginal value on crystal-clear connections or a lower rate of dropped calls than the operators think they do. These features are increasingly seen as the bare minimum, not qualities worth paying a full rate for. This is if people are even still making calls at the rate that they used to, which they are not. Nanu and its kind are not taking away revenue that operators would otherwise have kept.\n\nConsumers already prefer to engage in increasing chunks of non-voice communication for reasons that are complex, unpredictable and hard to define. The operators are being swept up in a revolutionary tide of behavioural change that will ebb and flow far quicker than they can hope to respond. But not all is lost. The term \"dumb pipe\" is often levelled at operators as a derisory label, but it overlooks the fact that telcos ultimately still own the pipe through which all things shiny and supposedly free flow. Even as voice minutes taper off, data is being gulped down in ever-larger quantities and the operators' pricing of bytes should eventually reflect that demand. Where operators cannot beat new services, however, they might have to buy them or at least work with them. Some of this is already happening, with acquisitions of mobile ad firms and collaborations with chat apps.\n\nBut worldwide, the industry is in several minds. Some operators are backing Rich Communication Services (RCS) - the industry's comeback to the likes of WhatsApp - and others are developing their own such service. The fact that RCS has not caught on for years and has significant integration issues does not bode well for it. More importantly, however, skirting cooperation with incumbent services that are already successful reveals a larger point - telcos continue to see these services as their enemies, when really, they are their own biggest ones.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/drawing-asserts-its-place-art", "site_title": "Drawing asserts its place in art", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nDrawing asserts its place in art\n\nHelmi Yusof\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Aug 7, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIN the world of art, painting is king: It is commonly collected and traded in the secondary market, fetching the shattering prices you see in headlines. Drawings, on the other hand, are the poor cousins of paintings. They are perceived as being easier to execute on paper and are typically less durable than paintings.\n\nHowever, a new show at Yeo's Workshop in Gillman Barracks attempts to dispel some of these notions and assert drawing as a medium in its own right. By assembling four talented artists - three Singaporean, one Thai - and showcasing their drawings on paper, A Drawing Show offers a rare perspective on the somewhat neglected medium.\n\nCurated by Louis Ho, the show's biggest coup is getting abstract heavyweight Ian Woo to be part of the group. Woo, 47, is well-known for his gorgeous paintings that sensually juxtapose colours and forms. Here, restrained perhaps by his choice of black pencil on paper, Woo resorts to a variety of techniques - from sharp parallel lines to billowy nebulae - to create the kind of borders, distinctions and tensions he usually creates with colours.\n\nThese drawings may be a far cry from his very elegant graphite-on-paper Lot series now showing at the Singapore Art Museum. But they do demonstrate a coarser, more chaotic side to the artist's visual sensibility rarely seen. And, going for lower prices - S$3,200 to S$12,000 - than his paintings, they offer fans a good opportunity to acquire his works.\n\nBesides Woo, there is also the talented but under-the-radar Boedi Widjaja, whose strong conceptual works have started to impress art lovers in recent years. Widjaja's works here appear like erratic cascades of black and brown specks. He created them by rubbing paper against the stone walls of Caylus, a medieval French village, where he attended an artistic residency programme.\n\nHe said he felt compelled to create these works from the \"architecture of Caylus . . . that have stood for centuries\" compared to the \"urban environment in Singapore . . . paper-thin, fragile, ephemeral\". From a pure visual perspective, though, these works are less compelling than his previous ones.\n\nMeanwhile, the third artist is Wong Lip Chin, a young graduate of Lasalle College of the Arts. Wong appropriates motifs from various animation characters - such as Mickey Mouse gloves and thick Super Mario-like moustache - and displays them along the walls and columns of the gallery, like so many designer logos.\n\nHowever, it is the fourth artist that impresses this writer the most. Jaitip Jaidee is a young Thai artist who inscribes thousands of tiny lines on wood veneer to create a dense geometric web. Priced at S$2,250, the works measure 71 cms by 51 cms and took three months each to complete. But just as they are painstakingly produced, they also reward slow and patient viewing. Not surprisingly, two of her three works were snapped up on the show's opening night - a testament to how drawing can indeed hold its own.\n\nA Drawing Show is on at Yeo's Workshop, 1 Lock Road, Gillman Barracks, until Sept 14. The gallery is closed on Mondays.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But it expects the operating environment to remain challenging in the second half of the year. \"This is in view of property cooling measures implemented by regulators in the markets in which the group operates, namely, Singapore, Malaysia and China; the tightening of supply of foreign labour in Singapore and the associated increased costs,\" the company said in a regulatory filing.\n\nNet profit for the three months ended June 30 stood at S$3.98 million, up from S$2.64 million. This translated to earnings of 1.53 Singapore cents per share, up from 1.02 Singapore cents per share.\n\nRevenue for the period fell 26.6 per cent to S$32.6 million, mainly due to fewer hospitality and commercial projects and distribution projects completed during the period. This was partly offset by the higher revenue contribution from the residential property projects.\n\nBut the company posted a bigger drop in cost of sales, which was down 35.2 per cent to S$24.4 million. The company recorded higher margins due to improved cost efficiencies achieved by the group's production facility in China. The company declared an interim dividend of 0.5 Singapore cent per share.\n\nShares of Design Studio last traded at 39.5 Singapore cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This segment recorded a 4 per cent dip in sales volume to six million tonnes in the second-quarter.\n\nThe group's share of results of associates was a pre-tax loss of US$4 million compared with a pre-tax profit of US$24.9 million a year ago.\n\nWhile oilseeds and grains recovered from losses in the first-quarter of this year, profit for the three months ended June was lower than the same period last year, due to difficult operating conditions.\n\nConsumer products and plantations and palm oil miills remained strong, while improved sugar results mitigated the higher seasonal losses in milling.\n\nHigher sales volume in oilseeds and grains and higher palm prices were offset by lower sales volume in sugar, so revenue for the quarter increased 0.9 per cent to US$10.52 billion.\n\nFor the first six months of the year, Wilmar recorded a 0.8 per cent rise in revenue to US$20.79 billion and a 37.7 per cent fall in net profit to US$332.5 million.\n\nThe group's chairman and chief executive officer, Kuok Khoon Hong, said: \"Lower prices due to improved global oilseed supplies, less excessive imports of beans into China and higher seasonal demand in the second half of the year should further improve crush margins in the coming months.\"\n\nLikewise, Mr Kuok said he expects the other divisions to perform better in the second half of the year.\n\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (Ebitda) was 8.9 per cent lower at US$389.4 million for the second-quarter this year.\n\nNet asset value per share went up 0.9 per cent to US$2.37 from US$2.35 as at end December last year.\n\nEarnings per share dropped 20.6 per cent to 2.7 US cents in Q2.\n\nThe group declared an interim tax exempt dividend of S$0.02 per share.\n\nThe counter closed trading unchanged at S$3.24 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Examples include Axis, a commercial and office/industrial Reit, and CapitaMalls Malaysia Trust (CMMT) where 70 per cent of loans carry fixed borrowing rates. Consequently, the quarter-point increase in the overnight policy rate in July that bumped the key lending rate to 3.25 per cent should have minimal impact on the Reits' earnings, AllianceDBS Research said.\n\nOffice Reit Quill Capita Trust (QCT) is further ahead - a hefty 95 per cent of its loans are pegged at a fixed rate.\n\nA similar rate hike might be looming but economists are divided as to whether the central bank would implement the move before the year is out or give borrowers a reprieve before bumping up lending rates in the first half of 2015.\n\nBut at half-time, M-Reits have performed to expectations; their earnings amounting to slightly below 50 per cent of FY14 forecasts.\n\nCMMT and QCT - Reits in which CapitaLand has interests - also managed positive rental revisions in the second quarter despite increasing competition.\n\nQCT, which has about a third of net lettable area (NLA) due for renewal this year, renewed 24 per cent of the NLA in the second quarter at up to 5 per cent more.\n\nCMMT malls saw even higher rental revisions - East Coast Mall in Penang by as much as 13.7 per cent. However, in Kuala Lumpur, Sungei Wang Plaza suffered a 7.4 per cent drop because of on-going construction work for the MRT; the well established mall is expected to see higher footfall when works are completed in 2017.\n\nMoreover, occupancy rates at CMMT malls remain impressive, ranging from 97.4 per cent at Sungei Wang to 99.7 per cent at The Mines.\n\nThe owner of 30 properties, Axis maintains that based on its distribution per unit and gains on disposal, it has returned a distribution yield of 6.2 per cent - slightly better than the latest declaration of 6 per cent by the Employees Provident Fund to its contributors.\n\nMore predictable but less attractive were 10-year MGS which offered 4 per cent and 12 months fixed deposit rates of 3-plus per cent - barely adequate to cover inflation of around 3.5 per cent.\n\nOn Monday, Axis said it proposed to buy three industrial buildings in Selangor for RM281 million; the asset injections are expected to enhance earnings.\n\nIn April, QCT acquired MRCB's Platinum Sentral in KL Sentral in a cash and new QCT units deal that led to MRCB owning 31 per cent of QCT.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/creating-poetry-prose-life", "site_title": "Creating poetry in the prose of life", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nCreating poetry in the prose of life\n\nThe beauty of even the most beautiful wine is more than doubled when shared with friends and when it reinforces the friendships, says NK YONG\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Aug 7, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n'When we share - that is poetry in the prose of life.'\n\n- Sigmund Freud (1856-1939)\n\nA BEAUTIFUL thought, and so simply expressed. When We Share. It does not really matter what. Whatever we have that others need or will also enjoy. Money, food and, of course, wine.\n\nOne would have to be truly a miser or hermit who drinks a bottle of wine all by himself or herself. Or who has no friends or friends he cares to share his wines with. The beauty of even the most beautiful wine is more than doubled when shared with friends, when it encourages exchange of thoughts and ideas, and reinforces the friendships.\n\nIt has been some time since Italian wines were featured in this column. So when last night an old friend from Jakarta phoned to tell us he had just got in and had no plans for dinner, I invited him to join me as I was propitiously dining alone at home. It would also give me a good reason for opening the bottle I had found earlier in the day when browsing through the cellar, Barolo \"Zonchera\" 1985, Ceretto, a well-known and reliable producer, and a very good vintage, 1985. This would be good enough to wash down a dinner of Chinese sausage rice and steamed chicken.\n\nBarolo \"Zonchera\" 1985, Ceretto\n\n100 per cent Nebbiolo, a blend of the fruit from different \"crus\" in lesser vintages not considered good enough to be bottled under their individual \"cru\" labels. (Purchased 1992 in Melbourne A$33.50. Drunk Aug 6, 2014)\n\nA very mature colour, medium-hued brown, with a pale rim 1-2mm, certainly very mature. At 29 years old, from a good vintage, this should by no means be too old for a good-class Barolo from a much respected producer. Fearing the worst, I stuck my nose in the glass. All fears were vanquished. The bouquet was magic - a lovely warm, soft and sweet aroma marked by very good freshness with aromas of ripe mature fruit, molasses and caramel. Beautifully balanced, gentle and delicate rather than sumptuous, very good complexity, a wine that caressed the palate and the throat on the way down, leaving its footprint lingering seductively on the palate. No trace at all of the tight edge of tannin that Barolos often leave behind on the palate. Instead, this was soft and feminine, seductive rather than overpowering.\n\nBarolo Brunate 1996, Elio Altare\n\nSingle cru 100 per cent Nebbiolo. The last bottle left over from the tasting led by grower Elio Altare himself in my home during his brief visit in 2000. Drunk during dinner at a good seafood restaurant in MacPherson Road with two Vietnamese friends who had just arrived from Ho Chih Minh City in the afternoon.\n\nMedium-dark brownish red, opaque. Bouquet of a youngish wine, fresh-smelling, orangey, touch of roses. Taste was rather tarry, but showed good ripe fruit, hints of chocolate, coffee and citrus fruit, clean, lingering finish which made you instinctively want another mouthful again. Very enjoyable.\n\nA true native of Barolo, a single cru wine, now in its prime but which will go on at this level for quite a few more years, very true to type.\n\nAgain they demonstrated what we already know - that wines such as these need two or more decades to reach their full potential. They are not expensive wines. Altare 2009 is available in Singapore at around S$150. Certainly worth buying if one is prepared to cellar it for 10 more years. Drunk now at this tender age of five years would be tantamount to infanticide. Certainly drinkable but enjoyable? Yes BUT. . .\n\nThe older Ceretto could not be found in Wine-Searcher.com. And if a wine as old as this can be found in wine stores abroad and if one is assured of the provenance, it would be well worth buying. There are wine merchants in Europe and England who specialise in stocking old vintages, but they are usually not cheap!\n\nOne possible source of old bottles is the wine lists of restaurants in Europe. (I know there are some European wine merchants who specialise in sourcing old vintages from restaurants but they are predictably expensive.) As a rule, these restaurants do not usually sell wine to \"take out\". But one could always ask! Sometimes it is possible but it would not be cheap. And if it does happen to be cheap, I would look for a catch.\n\nThe best solution? Order the bottle in the restaurant and drink it there.\n\nBeaune 1er cru Clos des Mouches Blanc 1993, Domaine Joseph Drouhin\n\nA white wine to complete the story, drunk before the Barolo Brunate. (Purchased 1995 locally, all of S$60 per bottle.)\n\nLight gold, surprisingly light for a 21-year-old, a delightful scent of lime. A bright clean taste of nuts and lime, smooth and elegant, no sharp notes. Good length, very youthful for its age.\n\nThis Premier Cru is in the Pommard end of the commune of Beaune, total 25.18 hectares, of which the house of Drouhin owns about half.\n\nThere are both red and white 1er Cru Clos des Mouches but the white is distinctly better than the red. This is one of my favourite whites. I have seldom been let down by it, whatever the vintage.\n\nThose used to the crispness and minerality of the whites from Puligny, Chassagne and Meursault may be put off by the light softness and roundness of Clos des Mouches, but it is the touch of spiciness and the light elegance of Clos des Mouches Blanc that I find most appealing. There is one other appeal - its price! At S$60 for this wine, would anyone find fault with it?\n\n\"When we share - that is poetry in the prose of life.\" Two recent occasions when the wines shared provided the poetry in the prose of life. It is this poetry that illuminates and enriches one's life.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Airbus has added eight wide-body orders to Iberia parent IAG since its latest monthly order sheet was compiled.\n\nIn an effort to reassure investors following a rise in the number of cancellations and amid growing industry concerns over a cyclical downturn, Airbus said last week that these included conversions between models and showed no underlying weakness.\n\nIt told analysts that some cancelled current-generation A320s would be replaced by a revamped version of the same model, due to make its maiden flight in September.\n\nIn its latest monthly order table, Airbus set out in more detail the way its order book has been evolving. It reported 44 new cancellations of its A320 model in July. Of these, 39 represented conversions between the two different models of A320, including 23 for AirAsia and 16 for Latam Airlines Group, it said in a table.\n\nHowever, a comparison of monthly data suggested that Latam had converted 12 aircraft and cancelled another four. Airbus declined further comment, saying it did not discuss decisions by its customers.\n\nAirbus confirmed the cancellation of six A380 superjumbo aircraft for Japan's Skymark Airlines.\n\nThe latest totals exclude 127 provisional orders for the newest version of its wide-body A330 jet, the A330neo, which was launched in Farnborough. Firm contracts are expected to be negotiated in the coming weeks and months.\n\nThe latest tally included 40 out of 43 aircraft announced as additional plane orders for BOC Aviation at the air show. Of these, three had already been placed in the order book in May.\n\nOn top of orders announced at the air show, Airbus reported a sale of 45 A320-family aircraft to one undisclosed customer.\n\nThe data also showed that Australia's Qantas had cancelled five A320 aircraft.\n\nIndustry sources have said that approximately that number of aircraft, assigned to Qantas unit Jetstar, have been sitting in Toulouse for some time awaiting delivery as the airline struggles to get regulatory approval for a Hong Kong venture.\n\nAirbus switched to a net order target for the year with its first-half results published last week, saying net orders should exceed deliveries and that these should be around the same as the 626 deliveries seen in 2013.\n\nAirbus said it had delivered 352 planes between January and July.\n\nIn the latest period for which delivery figures are available, Boeing handed over 342 aircraft between January and June.

The findings were based on seven months of research, though the company did not give a time period for the theft or name any websites that were hacked.\n\n\"We have been collecting information to help our customers stay more secure,\" said Alex Holden, the founder and chief information security officer of the company.\n\n\"We found that it was such a great impact to society that we decided to make a public statement.\"\n\nWhile the claim by Mr Holden still has to be verified, the details and scope of the attack are not surprising, said JD Sherry, vice-president for technology and solutions at security firm Trend Micro in the US.\n\n\"The Eastern European shadow economy is stocked with treasure troves of data as well as national security assets in the form of elite hackers,\" Mr Sherry said.\n\n\"It is plausible that a single syndicate has cornered the market and compromised over a billion credentials over an extended period of time.\"\n\nThe New York Times first reported the attack, saying the records were gathered from 420,000 websites including Fortune 500 companies.\n\nMr Holden said that the hackers operated from central Russia near the border with Kazakhstan. He declined to provide exact details about their location or identities in order to not jeopardise potential law enforcement operations.\n\nData was extracted from the websites using a network of compromised computers known as a botnet, according to a statement from Hold Security.

CIK is the karting commission of the FIA, the world motorsport governing body.\n\nAs for the latter, Mr Tan says it is worth the expense because a single-layer track can become bumpy with soil settlement, resulting in a roller coaster-like ride for the karts.\n\nHe should know what he is talking about - he was involved in the infrastructure of the short-lived karting track in Changi last year.\n\n\"I want to make it world-class,\" he explains.\n\nAn enthusiast for more than a decade and owner of more than 100 karts, he is passionate about the sport, having spent S$1.5 million promoting karting and the KF1 brand over the past three years. KF1 is the club series of races organised by Mr Tan.\n\n\"I love karting, I love the speed,\" he says.\n\nAn infrastructure specialist behind the set-up of National Day parades and the Singapore F1 night race, Mr Tan is no stranger to building things and making them work.\n\n\"I am lucky because my operating costs are not high - my full-time job is Arina and my track staff are from Arina and multi-tasking.\"\n\nMr Tan declines to reveal Mr Tilke's fee, citing a confidentiality agreement, and would only describe it as a \"friendship rate\".\n\nHe also does not want to specify the terms of the land lease but it is understood the annual rental is about S$150,000 although it varies slightly from year to year.\n\nHe does mention, though, that he is already losing money because he has been paying rent since July 1 - even before work on the circuit started.\n\nThe facility is expected to be completed by end-October. \"I am not thinking of ROI (return on investment). People who want to maximise profit will not bring in Tilke. You don't build a reputation overnight,\" he adds.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These devices are used to prevent reclogging of the arteries.\n\n\"Biosensors is transitioning from being heavily reliant on licensing and royalty income to becoming more capable of generating profits from its own operations, which is ultimately more sustainable,\" said its chairman and interim CEO Lu Yoh-Chie.\n\nNet profit for the three months ended June 30 stood at US$9.87 million, down from US$12.1 million a year ago. This translated to earnings per share of 0.58 US cent for the quarter, against 0.70 US cent a year earlier.\n\nRevenue for the medical device manufacturer rose 5 per cent to US$80.2 million, thanks to higher product revenue, though this was partially offset by lower licensing and royalty revenue.\n\nBut cost of sales outpaced turnover growth, with cost rising 28 per cent to US$20.5 million.\n\nBiosensors also recorded higher expenses. Its sales and marketing expenses - the biggest expense component - rose one per cent to US$26.9 million.\n\nIn July, shares of Biosensors were hit after the company's substantial shareholder CB Medical Holdings sold off nearly 40 million shares, bringing its stake to about 19 per cent.\n\nThe move by CB Medical, which is owned by China-based fund Citic Private Equity, could put to rest earlier speculation of a takeover offer, a CIMB report said then.\n\nShares of Biosensors closed yesterday at S$0.83, down two cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is understood that more than 80 per cent of the health insurance data in Form 7 - the document through which the five insurers submit their accident and health insurance data to the MAS - represents the IP businesses in Singapore.\n\nIPs are health insurance policies designed to provide additional coverage where the existing MediShield does not.\n\nThe underwriting profit margin for the IP sector has shrunk steadily, from 17.9 per cent in 2009 to 3.5 per cent last year.\n\nOver the same period, regulatory filings indicated that the management expense ratio dipped slightly, to 11.3 per cent from 16.1 per cent.\n\nThe distribution-costs ratio, comprising mainly net commissions incurred, was a little lower at 16.6 per cent last year, compared with 20 per cent five years ago.\n\nStill, both the management expense ratio and distribution costs ratio make up about a third of IP industry ratios.\n\nThe one item that bucked the trend was the claims ratio. In 2009, this was 46.1 per cent, but this rose to 68.6 per cent last year. This meant that S$506.56 million in net claims were incurred last year, more than triple the S$137.96 million in 2009.\n\nLikewise, 316,500 claims were registered by the insurers last year, almost double that of the 172,000 in 2009.\n\nThe data does not specify whether the net claims incurred came mainly from public or private health care providers.\n\nVincent Ee, the president of the Association of Financial Advisers Singapore, noting that over the past four or five years insurers had rolled out medical insurance plans on an \"as-charged\" basis, questioned whether this has motivated healthcare providers to supply services that are more costly.\n\n\"The questions to ask ourselves are whether healthcare providers are more open to offering expensive services to patients and also, whether patients are now asking for better and more costly medical services because they can now claim for them.\"\n\nFor the situation to improve, Mr Ee said, patients' liberal mentality in making IP claims has to change.\n\nKhoo Kah Siang, the president of the Life Insurance Association Singapore (LIA Singapore), said in his reply to The Business Times that premiums are based on three key factors - medical inflation, doctors' fees and insurers' claims experience.\n\nInsurers, on their part, will work with policy-makers and relevant parties to look into Singapore's rising medical inflation, he said.\n\n\"This includes improving the price transparency of professional fees within the healthcare industry, reviewing how benchmarks for such fees can support the cost management efforts of IP insurers, as well as the opportunity to analyse data to allow for scrutiny of unusually high bills.\"\n\nHe said there is a need for more transparency in terms of hospital charges, specialists' fees and drugs.\n\nHow more cost-effective quality care can be delivered is also something to be considered, said Dr Khoo.\n\nHe urged individuals, on their part, to be responsible for their personal health, as well as to manage their consumption of healthcare.\n\nBut beyond that, Dr Khoo noted that \"there should probably be a more transparent understanding of the claims experience\", which \"would enable the public to better appreciate the cost of healthcare and the drivers for changes\".\n\nHe explained that this would make the public more receptive to trade-offs when the government introduces future changes to the existing MediShield and the new MediShield Life.\n\nLast year, premiums earned by the insurers were more than double that of 2009, at S$738.26 million from S$299.29 million.\n\nA look at the individual insurers' operating results over the same five-year period showed that bigger industry players AIA and Prudential performed the best.\n\nAviva, which has the smallest market share, made the biggest operating losses for the three years between 2011 and last year.\n\nHowever, it is also the only one in the group that did not take a hit in net investment income last year, unlike the other insurers, who suffered losses.\n\nInterestingly, Aviva's management expense ratio came up to between 31.5 per cent and 53.2 per cent - the highest in the industry.\n\nOf the IP insurers, the distribution costs ratio of Prudential was the most substantial.\n\nOn this note, Mr Ee pointed out that the financial advisers' IP commissions have not gone up in the past four years.\n\nThe challenges facing the IP sector raises doubts about its sustainability, but Dr Khoo said insurers, as prudent financial entities, \"undertake and continuously pursue cost-effective ways to distribute, service and manage their products to ensure that they remain competitive\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The rest were sold to local developers at lower-than-expected prices.\n\nLast week, of the five Beijing lots put on auction, two that had their reserve price set near the city's record high received no bids, the first time that has happened in more than three years, according to local media.\n\nChina's real estate industry has been correcting since late last year as the central government takes steps to cool the overheated market. Official data show new home prices fell in June from May for a second straight month, with analysts forecasting further declines.\n\nThe situation contrasts with that last year when developers were willing to pay whatever it took to secure land. During the peak years in 2009 and 2013, such so-called \"land kings\" grabbed headlines with their aggressive bids.\n\nMarket observers said that as property sales slow and the credit market tightens, many developers, in particular small and medium-sized ones, have little cash to buy land especially in top-tier cities where prices are set with a high premium.\n\n\"Are we going to see 'land kings' in the second half? Unlikely. There will still be transactions, but it will depend on the location and the reserve price,\" said Knight Frank's head of valuation and consultancy, Thomas Lam.\n\nMr Lam added that large developers would rather invest abroad as inventories in mainland China are expected to remain high.\n\nBeijing-based Longfor Properties told an earnings briefing on Monday that it \"would rather miss the buying opportunity than buying wrong\", adding that it has slowed land purchases and new project starts since 2013.\n\nCommenting on land prices, chief executive officer Shao Mingxiao said: \"Supply in many Chinese cities is at a saturation level, so I don't see property prices will rise significantly . . . However, land prices did not fall accordingly. Many local governments did not change their attitude at all, that's why we saw the failed auction in Beijing recently.\"\n\nWith land prices set by local governments stuck at lofty levels, sales have fallen.\n\nGovernment land sales in value terms slumped 40 per cent in Beijing last month from a year earlier, data by research company China Real Estate Information Corp (CRIC) shows. Shanghai values dropped 27 per cent.\n\nThe total value of land sold by local governments in 100 cities last month fell 51 per cent from a year earlier, according to CRIC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of E-House China.\n\nSupply of residential housing has risen on the other hand.\n\nCRIC data released on Monday showed inventory levels in Beijing increased 30 per cent in July from a year earlier.

Other income was almost halved to S$5.3 million as no adoption grant income was taken up during the quarter because the current claims are \"pending the regulator's certification\", StarHub said.\n\nRevenue slipped 1.8 per cent to S$576.4 million during the quarter. Of the service segments, broadband revenue was hit the hardest, falling 17.2 per cent to S$51 million as it contended with price competition from other smaller outfits.\n\nThe heat in the broadband space also means that for 2014, StarHub now expects service revenue to be maintained at about last year's level. Previously, it had guided for growth in the low single-digit range.\n\nMobile revenue also shrank, shedding 1.4 per cent to S$310.3 million in the second quarter because of lower revenue from prepaid services. \"We registered higher data usage revenues in prepaid, but they were not able to compensate fully for the declines in IDD and SMS usage,\" said Kevin Lim, StarHub's chief commercial officer.\n\nThe postpaid segment was cheerier, adding 14,800 subscribers on a net basis during the quarter to reach about 1.24 million subscribers. Even so, average revenue per user (ARPU) shrank S$4 year-on-year to S$68 for Q2, because of the dilutive impact of the operator's promotional SharePlus plans which allows subscribers to have secondary lines.\n\nAs at June 30, 57 per cent of Star-Hub's postpaid customers were on tiered data plans.\n\nOn the pay-TV front, revenue grew 3 per cent to S$98.4 million for the quarter, with a residential customer base of 535,000 - 2,000 more than in the quarter before.\n\nStarHub's fixed network services revenue also saw growth, up 2.2 per cent to S$92 million for the quarter.\n\nFor the half-year period, net profit was down by 6.9 per cent at S$178.5 million while revenue stood at S$1.15 billion, a 1.6 per cent decrease.\n\nEarnings per share for the group stood at 5.5 Singapore cents and 10.4 Singapore cents for the quarter and six-month period, respectively, down from 5.8 Singapore cents and 11.1 Singapore cents during the corresponding periods the year before. The group declared an interim cash dividend of five Singapore cents per share, the same as last year's.\n\nStarHub's counter closed six Singapore cents higher before the release of its results yesterday, at S$4.23.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This would have meaningful implications for India's fixed income markets. We believe the next decade for India's FX and fixed income markets will be marked by policy-driven reforms driving accelerated growth with increasing market liberalisation.\n\nRecent figures already appear more encouraging than the dynamics that have been supporting stagflationary recession conditions: The country's balance of payments has improved, spurred by FX depreciation and the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI's) non-conventional measures; the growth outlook has turned moderately positive, helped by a global recovery; and bad loan formation, even at state-owned banks, may now be moderating. The narrative for Indian markets began to brighten even before the elections.\n\nFollowing the second stage of India's economic liberalisation and the foreign direct investment (FDI) reforms initiated in September 2012, foreign investment will likely be a major contributor to a jump in private investment. However, despite liberal FDI limits, foreign investment in India has remained moderate - constrained, in part, by administrative hurdles.\n\nAs the obstacles are reduced, we expect FDI to lead an investment boom over the next decade, similar to China's mid-1990s experience. We project FDI will rise to an average of 2.5 per cent of GDP (F2014-F2024) from an average of 1.5 per cent of GDP (F2008-F2014) (see chart 1) We believe such foreign capital flow will lend significant support to India's balance of payments trajectory.\n\nIndia's economy remains domestically oriented and a net importer. We expect the import growth pace to rise as domestic growth recovers and the government revokes extraordinary restrictions on imports and outward remittances. The service sector has been the major source of export income, as India's market share in global services has risen by 2.5x over the past decade.\n\nOver the long term, we think India is likely to maintain a stable net current account deficit of about 2.5 per cent of GDP. This is close to the historically sustainable level of deficit of about 2 per cent of GDP (see chart 2). We expect the positives of FDI inflows, against the offset of a widening current account, to drive the currency path, resulting in a stable real effective exchange rate (REER) path - but a weaker nominal path, curbed by India's high inflation differential against its major trading partners.\n\nAlthough there is a positive historical correlation between India's balance of payments flows and the change in the Indian rupee real effective exchange rate, the RBI is likely to remain a long-term buyer of US$/rupee, absorbing a significant portion of the net capital inflows. Adjusting for RBI interventions, we expect a stable REER to be maintained within +/-1 standard deviation over the long term.\n\nAssuming that United States CPI inflation remains close to its target of 2 per cent per year, and India follows a disinflationary path over the next few years, the inflation differential against the US would still be equivalent to a 30-35 per cent decline in the PPP fair value for the rupee, taking our nominal fair value estimate 10 years out to a 75-85 range.\n\nWe expect India's credit markets to triple in size by 2019, partly reflecting growth and capital needs, but mostly increasing reliance on debt capital markets. India could become the second-largest G3 bond issuer in Asia, reaching the US$160 billion mark by 2018 - with US$100 billion worth of bonds from non-financial corporates (as their reliance on capital markets grows from a very low base) and US$60 billion worth of financial bonds. The Indian US$/G3 bond market, on average, should see annual gross issuance in excess of US$30 billion by 2018, up from our US$16 billion 2014 forecast (see chart 3).\n\nOn the interest-rate front, local bond markets may benefit from a successful fight against inflation and potential relaxation of foreign investor limits, but real yields will also have to rise to ensure a stable savings rate and to reflect stronger growth.\n\nA positive surprise for Indian interest rates markets could come from potential inclusion in the global bond indices. We believe that if India considers inclusion in the global indexes, it is likely to get the maximum weight in most indices, given the large market capitalisation of ~US$600 billion of its government bond market. We estimate the initial impact of such a move could prompt foreign investor inflows of US$20-30 billion for India's bond market.\n\nFinally, we expect India's sovereign rating to remain unchanged in the near term. Any upgrade would require considerable improvement in inflation, fiscal balance and current account.\n\nThe writer is head of Asia Fixed Income Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It was a snappy way of saying that the economy was growing at a nice, steady pace - fast enough to create jobs but not so rapidly that it would lead to runaway inflation. As Robert Reich, then the secretary of labor, put it in 1995, the US at that moment was enjoying a Goldilocks recovery that was \"not too hot, not too cold\". Wall Street loved that formula, and the stock market boomed.\n\nMuch the same could have been said these days, although Goldilocks hasn't been invoked all that often to describe the recent environment. That may be because the Federal Reserve has been such a commanding presence that it has overshadowed everything else, Seth Masters at Bernstein Global Wealth Management said.\n\n\"It's as though Goldilocks entered the house of the three bears and found the porridge was being heated in a big microwave oven,\" he said. \"Sure, it's just the right temperature inside, but there's a reason for it.

Not since the prosecution in 1981 of the Gang of Four - which included Mao Zedong's widow, Jiang Qing - has there been an investigation of China's officialdom that has reached so high into China's political hierarchy.\n\nThe opaqueness of China's system and a long history of political purges has prompted speculation that the investigation into Mr Zhou - a one-time close associate of another high-profile political figure Bo Xilai, who has been jailed for corruption - is yet another politically motivated exercise to root out opponents of China's ruling clique. But such cynicism seems misplaced. For one thing, China's anti-corruption drive, which has been in effect since 2012, has been too broad based to be characterised as targeted at just political enemies. More than 60,000 officials have been investigated including scores of senior-ranking party members. Perks enjoyed by Chinese officials across the board such as generous entertainment and travel allowances have been slashed.\n\nPublic opinion in China - at least, that which can be discerned through online and social media channels - has also been vociferous about the scourge of corruption, the pervasiveness of which is an open secret throughout the country. Any government would be duty-bound to respond and that this is happening should be no surprise.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That would pinch retailers, many of whom have been struggling to increase sales this year, before the holiday shopping season.\n\nWest Coast longshoremen have worked without a contract since July 11. Talks between the union and employers represented by the Pacific Maritime Association resumed on Monday after a 10-day break. The old contract prohibited longshoremen from striking in support of the truck drivers. With no contract, the longshoremen are now free to join picket lines.\n\n\"This could happen, and it would be quite dramatic,\" said Nelson Lichtenstein, director of the Center for the Study of Work, Labor and Democracy at the University of California at Santa Barbara. \"It would shut the ports down. It would stop everything.\"\n\nCraig Merrilees, a spokesman for ILWU, and Wade Gates of the San Francisco-based Pacific Maritime Association, declined to comment on the drivers' situation.\n\nMr Merrilees said by telephone that talks between the ILWU and the maritime group resumed on Monday. The union's concerns include workers' safety, health and pension benefits and technology that could displace workers, he said.\n\nDrivers walked off the job and formed picket lines at three of the eight terminals at the Port of Los Angeles on July 7. Longshoremen, who load and unload cargo ships, arrived for work that day and chose to honour the pickets until an arbitrator ruled that it was against their contract terms.\n\nFor the two hours that the longshoremen threw their weight behind the picketers, at least two terminals, operated by Scottsdale, Arizona-based American President Lines and Tokyo-based Yusen Logistics Co, closed their gates, Mr Sanfield said.\n\nShould they resume their work action, drivers would be legally restricted to picketing the terminals where their companies do business, which may limit their impact on port operations, said Peter Olney, a retired organising director at the ILWU. Federal laws, such as the Taft-Hartley Act, that restrict labour unions' actions, may also curb the longshore workers' involvement, he said.\n\n\"People will cite the law, and lawyers are going to scurry around with all kinds of theories,\" said Mr Olney, a former advisory board member of the University of California at Berkeley's Labor Center.\n\nThousands of companies use the harbours in Los Angeles and Long Beach to move merchandise, according to Art Wong, a Port of Long Beach spokesman. They include Issaquah, Washington-based Costco Wholesale Corp, Minneapolis-based Target Corp, Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart Stores, Atlanta-based Home Depot, Toyota Motor and Mercedes-Benz AG. About 40 per cent of all US container trade passes through the Southern California hub, according to the ports.\n\nThe odds are not in favour of a strike right now, said David Ross, a transportation analyst for Stifel, Nicolaus & Co in Baltimore. If negotiations drag on past Sept 1, the possibility of a work stoppage is heightened, he said. There was more concern before the contract expired, and a lot of shippers took care of third-quarter orders in the second quarter, he added.\n\nThe maritime association, which represents shipping lines and terminal operators, locked out workers at 30 West Coast ports for 10 days in 2002 after contract talks stalled. That interruption costs US$1 billion a day, according to the maritime association.\n\nEach day of another stoppage of that duration at the West Coast ports, of which Los Angeles and Long Beach are by far the largest, would sap US$2.1 billion a day from the US economy, according to a June report from the National Retail Federation and the National Association of Manufacturers.\n\nBy an almost two-to-one ratio, the Southern California ports were the busiest in the US last year when measured by cargo value. Houston and Galveston, Texas, are the second- largest, followed by New York and New Orleans, according to the American Association of Port Authorities, an Alexandria, Virginia-based trade group. The two Texas ports lead the US in tonnage, followed by New Orleans and the Southern California harbours, according to the association. Shanghai is the biggest port by tonnage in the world, the association said.\n\nThe drivers haul cargo from the harbours. For years they've protested against logistics companies that categorise them as contractors, which they said deprives them of benefits and wages to which they're entitled. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/f07f1d94da1a255d749e859acc8581f927802870dfa0a71f176d11435ac46536?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Standstill threat: At risk is a portion of the US$435 billion worth of annual trade through Los Angeles and Long Beach, the two largest US ports. - PHOTO: BLOOMBERG"}]}

The bank has launched a video contest to offer the lowest home loan rates in town, though it's for August only.\n\nHome sales have been languishing amid the tough financing rules rolled out since June last year. At OCBC, new home loan applications have fallen around 40 per cent year on year, said Lynnice Ng, OCBC spokeswoman. So, the name of the game is not to just sell loans to buyers of new homes but refinancing, that is, win over a customer from another bank and also entice those with a HDB loan.\n\nSeizing on the nation's celebratory mood for the upcoming National Day party, OCBC is inviting customers to submit a video on what home means to them.

So the committee will have to spend quite a bit of its time scoping out the landscape of this industry, understanding the new technology, the parameters and challenges involved, and then set relevant standards that will enable the technology to be more easily adopted in the manufacturing processes.\"\n\nSome 50 potential standards have been identified by Spring and the Singapore Standards Council, to be developed over the next three to five years. These include standards on quality management, on-site monitoring and the use of advanced non-destructive evaluation techniques in additive manufacturing.\n\nMr Tan said that besides the manufacturing sector, Spring will look at sectors with good growth potential, and those that fill a national need; it will, for instance, come up with standards for the silver industry and areas such as medical devices and medical technology.\n\nIn 2013, Spring developed and reviewed some 180 Singapore standards and built a pool of some 290 competent conformity assessment bodies.\n\nA total of 630 companies benefited from having adopted Spring-supported standards and business and service excellence projects last year.\n\nJohn Kong, the managing director of M Metal, a manufacturer and supplier of roofing materials to the construction industry, said it was because his company had incorporated standards that it was able to pitch and win the tender for a large downtown project entailing the supply of 220,000 sq m of steel decking.\n\n\"Adopting standards is almost a must to get your product to be used in the construction industry. The additional grant is a plus for small and medium-sized enterprises - not just for the money, but more importantly, it can help us look beyond current standards and enable us to understand more and move ahead of the standards,\" said Mr Kong, a member of the Standards Development Organisation Committee of the Singapore Manufacturing Federation (SMF) and the chairman of the SMF's Metal, Machinery & Engineering Industry Group.\n\nSeparately, the Singapore Accreditation Council launched an accreditation scheme for the certification bodies of learning-service providers.\n\nThe scheme will ensure that certification bodies provide systematic and impartial third-party assessment and certification of learning-service providers.\n\nSpring also signed two Memoranda of Understanding: The first was with Singapore Polytechnic to further its collaboration in the design of a course curriculum and delivery of a diploma course in Applied Sciences to raise the competency level of workers in laboratory management; the second was with the Joint Accreditation System of Australia and New Zealand to deepen collaboration in accreditation.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will use 285-seater Airbus A330-300s in a two-class configuration with 30 Business Class seats and 255 Economy Class seats on the route.\n\nSIA will operate flights to Sapporo's New Chitose Airport twice weekly on Mondays and Fridays. SQ660 will depart from Singapore's Changi Airport at 11.30pm and arrive in Japan at 8am the next day. The return flight SQ661 will depart Sapporo at 9.30am on Tuesdays and 8.55am on Saturdays.\n\nSIA also operates flights to other cities in Japan, namely Fukuoka, Nagoya, Osaka and Tokyo.\n\nThe airline, which released its Q1 FY2014/15 results last week, reported a 71.4 per cent drop in net profit to S$34.8 million for the first quarter ended June 30, on the back of lower revenue and higher share of losses of associated companies such as Tiger Airways. Revenue was 4.1 per cent lower year-on- year at S$3.68 billion due to weaker yields and softer travel demand from certain key markets.\n\nCommenting on its outlook last week, SIA said the industry continues to face challenges, including high fuel prices, uncertainties in the global economy and geo-political concerns in the region.\n\nIn the stock market yesterday, the counter closed at S$9.97, down three cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Australia has set aside up to A$90 million (S$104.67 million) and estimates a 12-month search of the area will cost around A$52 million. The search is already the most expensive ever undertaken.\n\nChina, which had 153 nationals on board MH370, has been heavily involved, providing ships, aircraft and satellite technology. One Chinese vessel will stay in the search area until mid-September. Mr Truss said Beijing has shown no sign it would cover any of the commercial search costs.\n\nDozens of ships and planes scoured vast areas of ocean in the months after the plane disappeared but found only rubbish.\n\nThe search was narrowed in April after a series of acoustic pings thought to be from the plane's black box recorders were heard near its last location shown by satellite data analysis.\n\nMalaysia Airlines has been battered this year by the tragic unprecedented loss of two of its airliners, after Flight MH17 was shot down over a conflict zone in eastern Ukraine.\n\nWith a long maritime history and seafaring expertise, Dutch companies are leaders in the field of complex, large-scale undersea search and salvage operations. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/bbcd1e2b59ec3cabcdacdd8cdb3ea757d8921860fb5b4ba0c3de665240d3d233?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Mission to unlock mystery: Fugro was selected after 'offering the best value-for-money technical solution' for the seafloor search, says Australian Transport Minister and Deputy PM Warren Truss. - PHOTO: REUTERS"}]}

Since January 2013, Singapore citizens who already own one residential property would have to pay ABSD of 7 per cent when they purchase a second one. Those with two or more existing residential properties would have to pay ABSD of 10 per cent on their next purchase.\n\nSingapore permanent residents would have to pay an ABSD of 5 per cent for their first residential property purchase or 10 per cent if they already own one or more residential properties. Foreign residents and non-individuals would have to pay an ABSD of 15 per cent when they purchase any residential property.\n\nResidential prices started to correct only in the third quarter of last year after the TDSR was introduced.\n\nMr Khaw pointed out that various concessions are already in place to benefit upgraders. For example, married Singaporean couples can enjoy a refund on ABSD if they sell their existing home within a stipulated period after the purchase of their second home.\n\nSimilarly, an upgrader may qualify for the highest loan-to-value limit of 80 per cent on his second loan if he is able to provide documents to his bank to show that he will be selling his existing home. This enables him to be treated as a borrower with no outstanding housing loans.\n\n\"The existing concessions are reasonable and sufficient,\" Mr Khaw told the House. \"Any move to relax the cooling measures, including by broadening these concessions, is premature under current market conditions.\"\n\nHe added that the cooling measures are \"intended to keep Singapore's market stable and sustainable\" by encouraging financial prudence among home-buyers and moderate property prices.\n\nMany market watchers have echoed the view that it is too early for the government to lift its cooling measures. Some believe that the government is comfortable with a 10-15 per cent decline in residential property prices over the next two years, which translates to about 1.5 per cent drop in prices every quarter.\n\nSong Seng Wun, executive director and regional economist at CIMB Research, noted that Asia is still in net liquidity position and much liquidity is waiting on the sidelines.\n\nHe reckoned that the government will not lift its property cooling measures before the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The group achieved initial percentage of completion revenue recognition for two rig building projects during the quarter, compared to one rig building and two offshore and conversion projects a year ago.\n\nEarnings per share came to 6.3 Singapore cents, up from 5.98 Singapore cents previously.\n\nRig building was the largest revenue earner and also saw the largest increase in turnover at S$873.6 million, 39.1 per cent more than the S$628 million a year ago. The offshore & conversion and repair divisions saw a decline in turnover of 10 and 5.1 per cent, respectively.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, SembMarine achieved a 4.3 per cent year-on-year increase in net profit to S$254.1 million, from S$243.6 million.

The company delivered six jack-up rigs in the first half of the year, with another eight in progress stage.\n\nThe fixed platform segment registered a 30 per cent increase in revenue to S$535 million for the first half, from S$413 million previously, with two major project deliveries in the second quarter. On the other hand, offshore and conversion revenue declined 40 per cent to S$123 million from S$206 million, with just one project delivery during the period.\n\nShip repair revenue was 2 per cent lower at S$307 million, down from S$314 million previously.\n\nFor the first half of the year, SembMarine earned 12.17 Singapore cents per share, up from 11.67 Singapore cents a year ago.\n\nSembMarine yesterday also announced an interim cash dividend of five Singapore cents per share to be paid out on Aug 29.\n\nThe group has a net order book of S$12.7 billion with completion and deliveries stretching into 2019. This includes a total of S$2.5 billion in new rig and offshore conversion contracts secured since the start of 2014, but excludes repair and upgrade contracts.\n\nEven though the group acknowledged that the long-term fundamentals driving the offshore exploration and production (E&P) market remain stable, it was concerned about the slowdown in capital expenditure, which may impact new orders while keen competition continues to exert pressure on margins.\n\n\"Overall, our repair business continues to see increase in market share. However, despite the large number of vessels, the average revenue per ship remained low in view of market conditions.\"\n\nIn the stock market yesterday, SembMarine shares closed at S$4.10, up one cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The fall in charter revenue also stemmed from reduced charter rates for two vessels which started their charter to Maersk Line in the previous quarter.\n\nThe Q2 net profit jump took into account an US$11.4 million one-off gain following the early settlement of a convertible loan owed to Polaris Shipmanagement (Polaris), at a 20 per cent discount. The convertible loan had a carrying value of US$50.6 million on the settlement date but following discussions between Rickmers and Polaris, the latter agreed to receive US$39.2 million in the second quarter as full and final settlement of the convertible loan.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The fine will be capped at S$2 million.\n\nFailure to comply with the preventive measures would mean an extra S$50,000 fine per day.\n\nDr Balakrishnan said that his ministry had received strong support for a regime to impose a \"substantial financial penalty\" on errant entities, and that this would act as an \"effective counter\" against the strong economic motivations of companies.\n\nHe said that the Bill has been designed to catch those involved - directly or indirectly - in slash-and-burn activities overseas that result in transboundary haze pollution in Singapore.\n\nIn his speech, he made the point that some groups of people, especially those with health problems, and the operations of businesses in the tourism sector for example, can be severely hit during bouts of haze.\n\nHe noted that an economist had assessed that, had last year's haze crisis, which started in June, lasted until September, with pollution occasionally going into the unhealthy levels, up to US$1.2 billion in economic losses could have been run up.\n\nThe new laws will thus provide a legal resource to affected people in Singapore who have suffered from the haze to seek redress from the responsible party.\n\n\"The Singapore Government and this House want to send a strong signal that we will not tolerate the actions of errant companies that harm our environment and put at risk the health of our citizens,\" said Dr Balakrishnan.\n\n\"Given the very strong economic incentives today for companies to adopt, quite frankly, the cheapest methods of clearing land for plantations, we need to tilt the playing field in favour of businesses that do the right and responsible thing, and to deter those who do not.\"\n\nHe added that the Bill is not intended to replace the laws and enforcement actions of other countries, but to complement their efforts to hold companies to account.\n\nThe debate on the Bill was adjourned last night and will resume later today, after which the Bill is likely to be passed into law.\n\nIn a separate statement, the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources said yesterday that it has offered Indonesia extra help to battle the haze in the form of a helicopter equipped to fight fires.\n\nThis is on top of the haze-assistance package offered by the Republic in June, which includes an aircraft for cloud seeding and the sharing of high-resolution satellite images and hotspot coordinates.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Opening is slated for 2016.\n\nSeattle, the fastest-growing among the top 50 US cities, is attracting a wave of development as employers such as Amazon.com Inc expand and lodging occupancies reach records.\n\nThree hotels opened in 2013 and two were completed early this year, while almost a dozen have been proposed in or near the central business district, according to a report by local commercial real estate broker Kidder Mathews.\n\n\"Seattle is among the top three office markets in the US, next to San Francisco and New York,\" Douglas Howe, Touchstone's president, said. \"There is a strong need for business-hotel hospitality.\"\n\nHotel demand is also benefiting from growing tourism, which has been bolstered by the arrival of the cruise-ship industry and an increase in travellers from Asia, Mr Howe said.\n\nHotel occupancies in Seattle climbed to 73 per cent in the first six months of 2014 from 69 per cent in the first half of last year, while the average nightly rate jumped 6.1 per cent to US$128.09, according to Hendersonville, Tennessee-based research company STR Inc. That compares with occupancies of 64 per cent and average room rates of US$114.06 nationwide.\n\nTwo Seattle hotels changed hands in the past two months for record prices per room, according to John Gordon, a senior hotel appraiser at Kidder Mathews's office in nearby Bellevue. On July 1, the boutique Hotel 1000 downtown sold for US$517,000 per room, an all-time high for the city, and breaking the previous record of US$410,000 per room set when the bigger Red Lion Hotel downtown, renamed Motif Seattle, was sold in June, he said.\n\n\"Strong occupancy and rising rates have made Seattle a high-profile target for hotel developers,\" Kidder Mathews said in its second-quarter report. The central business district and South Lake Union, where Amazon is based, are two areas of particular interest, the firm said.\n\nAmazon moving its main offices to just north of the downtown core and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation opening new headquarters near downtown have been major draws for hotels, according to Mr Gordon.\n\n\"Assuming it's an urban hotel, they live and die by business travellers,\" Mr Gordon said. \"It's generally accepted that if you have a healthy office market, that will support a high volume of demand.\"\n\nSeattle's growth has brought with it concerns over density and affordability, as well as increased traffic and parking congestion. Major crimes were up 19 per cent in the first four months of 2014 from a year earlier, spurring Mayor Ed Murray to begin a series of community walks with residents, police and city officials to improve public safety.\n\nOther developments in Seattle include a 137-room Element Hotel, a brand owned by Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc, in the Belltown neighbourhood and a 184-room luxury SLS Hotel in the office district. A 278-room Embassy Suites, a Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc chain, is planned just north of CenturyLink Field, where the Seattle Seahawks National Football League team plays.\n\nThe \"most ambitious\" plan is a 1,680-room convention hotel with 160 apartments, restaurants and retail space on a block occupied by the former Greyhound bus station, according to Kidder Mathews. The project, awaiting permits, would be the biggest hotel ever in Seattle, the firm said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Property\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up", "images": []}

That pace of growth is alluring for banks in the region.\n\n\"While the liquidity in the Dim Sum market has still a long way to go to reach the G3 markets, the management is very keen to maintain our edge in this market,\" said a Hong Kong-based rates and foreign-exchange trader, whose investment bank recently moved a credit derivatives analyst to Dim Sum trading.\n\nMany Dim Sum issues are still too small to be actively traded by the world's biggest credit funds, but bankers note an increase in overseas interest for the securities.\n\n\"We are seeing more investor queries from various quarters, even outside the region, when it comes to China fixed income,\" said Vishal Goenka, head of local currency credit trading, Asia at Deutsche Bank based in Singapore. - IFR\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nBRC Asia secures contracts for Changi Airport Terminal 5 project worth S$570 million\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:04 PM\n\nDollar-selling is becoming a bubble, which may burst, HSBC says\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:03 PM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM", "images": []}

From next year, life insurers in Singapore must sell protection up to a sum assured of S$400,000 under this scheme.\n\nThe scheme involves two products - term life insurance and whole life insurance, both with total permanent disability cover. All Singapore insurers will be required to sell commission-free products.\n\nThere would be a positive \"headline revenue impact\", but given the intense competition, the drop in premium rates could hit profitability, with the extent of the drop depending on insurers' sales strategy for such products, Fitch said. \"It is, however, premature to assess this in full.\"\n\nFitch rated this a \"credit positive\" for the life insurance sector, saying this would eliminate commission costs and reduce the prices of direct-sale products - factors that could have deterred consumers from buying life insurance.\n\nAgent commission is part of distribution costs, which constitute 8-10 per cent of premiums paid.\n\n\"The decision is likely to boost the overall penetration rate of the life sector while also prompting a re-evaluation of strategies on distribution channels, which may enhance productivity,\" said Fitch.\n\n\"This may prompt companies to refocus their clientele base and shift the agent-channel toward more complex products and larger assured sums - and away from segments which are likely to only utilise the commission-free products.\"\n\nThe overall penetration rate of the life sector in Singapore trails that of other high-income Asian economies, Fitch noted.\n\nThe rating agency cited statistics from Swiss Re that showed life premiums as a percentage of GDP in Singapore stood at 4.4 per cent last year. This is behind Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea. Singapore trails Taiwan and Hong Kong the most, with their life premium-to-GDP ratio at 14.5 per cent and 11.7 per cent, respectively.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Of course, as soon as the accident had happened, his friends had used their mobiles to let their parents and friends know and within minutes garbled unverified reports were circulating.

LinkedIn Corp jumped 12 per cent after projecting revenue that beat forecasts. Procter & Gamble Co increased 3 per cent as profit topped estimates amid cost reductions.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.3 per cent to 1,925.15 at 4pm in New York last Friday, bringing its weekly loss to 2.7 per cent - the worst since June 2012. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 69.93 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 16,493.37, after erasing its gains for the year. About 7.3 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges that day, 27 per cent above the three- month average.\n\n\"Whether it's the Portuguese bank, Argentina or continued unrest in the Middle East, these things are seemingly mattering more to investors now,\" Matt McCormick, who helps oversee US$11 billion as a fund manager at Cincinnati- based Bahl & Gaynor Inc, said in a phone interview.\n\n\"All of a sudden, geopolitical things that didn't matter a few weeks ago are starting to be more relevant concerns, and they're serving as catalysts to sell. Investors are getting more risk-averse.\"\n\nUS stocks joined a global selloff last Thursday, sending the S&P 500 to its first monthly decline since January, after companies from Exxon Mobil Corp to Samsung Electronics Co reported results that disappointed investors, Argentina defaulted, and Banco Espirito Santo SA was ordered to raise capital.\n\nBanco Espirito Santo shares were suspended last Friday by Portugal's securities regulator after they dropped as much as 50 per cent in Lisbon. Global financial markets were roiled last month after another holding company in the group missed payments on commercial paper.\n\nArgentina's failure to pay interest on its bonds is a credit event that will trigger settlement of US$1 billion of default insurance, according to the International Swaps & Derivatives Association. Argentina is the first nation to trigger default swaps since Greece restructured its debt in 2012.\n\nThe S&P 500, which is still up 4.2 per cent this year, has gone without a 10 per cent correction since 2011. The benchmark index is down 3.2 per cent from a record of 1,987.98 reached on July 24. It trades at 17.5 times the reported earnings of its companies - near the highest level since 2010.\n\nMarket volatility is rising after the S&P 500 ended its longest stretch of calm since 1995. The index has posted gains or losses of more than one per cent three times in the past two weeks, compared with none during the 62 days through July 16, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.\n\nThe Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as the VIX, rose 0.5 per cent last Friday to 17.03. The gauge surged 27 per cent on Thursday to the highest level since April 11. The volatility measure fell to the lowest since 2007 on July 3.\n\nStocks fluctuated earlier on Friday as data showed employers in the US added more than 200,000 jobs for a sixth straight month in July, the longest such period since 1997. The 209,000 advance fell short of the 230,000 increase forecast by economists.\n\nThe jobless rate climbed to 6.2 per cent from 6.1 per cent in June as more people entered the labour force. Wages and hours were unchanged from June.\n\nPacific Investment Management Co's Bill Gross said the Federal Reserve will remain accommodative with wage growth in the US unchanged.\n\nWages \"are not raging,\" Mr Gross, manager of the world's biggest bond fund, said during a radio interview on Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene. \"American wages on Main Street are (Federal Reserve chairwoman) Janet Yellen's No 1 concern.\"\n\nConcern has grown that the improving economy may force the Fed to raise interest rates sooner than expected. Data earlier last week showed US gross domestic product expanded at a 4 per cent annual pace in the second quarter, confirming the Fed's view that a first-quarter contraction was transitory.\n\nManufacturing expanded in July at the fastest pace in more than three years, data last Friday showed, signalling US factories will help power the economy after a Q2 rebound. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's final sentiment index for July fell to 81.8 from 82.5 in June.\n\nThe Fed last week cut its monthly bond buying to US$25 billion in its sixth consecutive US$10 billion reduction. The Fed's Open Market Committee reiterated that it's likely to reduce bond buying in \"further measured steps\" and to keep interest rates low for a \"considerable time\" after ending purchases. The central bank said slack in the labour market persists even though the economy is picking up.\n\nFed Bank of Dallas president Richard Fisher said he believes the timing has moved up for the first main interest rate increase from close to zero because of a strengthening economy and higher inflation. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

Through this, nanu is able to make money - from advertisers - which it then uses to pay for the cost of all calls.\n\nIts revenue model, though solely dependent on advertising, is sustainable, said Mr Nygate, because being on mobile allows advertisers to track the geo-location of nanu users and target their advertisements accordingly, making it an attractive model for them.\n\nThe startup is now in talks with clients like Nestle, KFC and HTC, and aims to inject 97 per cent of its advertising revenue back into the system in the form of free calls for users.\n\nUnlike existing apps like Skype and Viber, nanu works on any network, including 2G, and not just high bandwidth environments like 3G, 4G or WiFi.\n\nIt uses an ultra-low bandwidth technology that allows it to provide quality Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calls even on 2G, a network used by about five billion people in rural areas and developing countries.\n\nVoIP calls are calls made over the Internet, and not traditional telephone networks.\n\n\"This means no more calls breaking up in poor network environments, making nanu the only viable mobile VoIP service in the 2G market, and the most reliable in the rest of the world,\" said Mr Nygate.\n\nOn launch, nanu's infrastructure and network capacity can support 50 million users, but there is no limit to the number of users that can potentially benefit from free nanu calls. The more users the app has, the more calls will be made through its network; the more revenue it generates from advertisers, the more free minutes it can deliver to more users.\n\nCurrently, nanu-to-nanu mobile calls are free anywhere.\n\nMobile calls to landlines are free for 15 minutes, limited to the first one million users, and can be used in 73 global destinations, among them Singapore, China, India, Russia, the UK and US - accounting for close to half of the world's population covered by cellular networks.\n\nMobile calls to non-nanu mobile phones are free in nine countries, including Singapore, India, Thailand, Germany and the US.\n\nSaid Mr Nygate: \"Telcos have been exploiting the cost of calls for years by charging high roaming charges. nanu wants to change this as we believe keeping in touch should be made as easy as possible.\"\n\nHe added that the startup has had discussions with global telcos that have expressed interest in licensing nanu's technology, but it has decided to offer the app free-of-charge directly to users instead.\n\nStill, it expects to work with telcos to ensure a win-win value proposition for all. After all, nanu - a VoIP service like Skype and Viber - requires a telco's infrastructure, mobile data or WiFi to work.\n\nSaid Clement Teo, a telco analyst at Forrester: \"VoIP calls are cheap; the advertisements they draw can help defray costs ... although advertising revenue will only work for players with a large user base. But to run a proper business- grade call service, the telcos do it better. The network investments they have made, and the conferencing services they offer are of business grade ... small players cannot replicate that.\"\n\nFor StarHub, it is through investments in 4G and 3G network upgrades that its mobile customers can enjoy a 99.97 per cent call success rate and 99.99 per cent service availability, said Michael Chang, assistant vice-president of mobility at StarHub.\n\n\"Our customers have the assurance that their mobile calls can reach anyone with a mobile phone, regardless of app ... and have come to expect unmatched crystal-clear phone conversations in HD with reduced background noise,\" he said.\n\nBut Forrester's Mr Teo said an important question should be if telcos can defend against non-business grade users who are switching to free calls.\n\n\"Probably not,\" he said. \"The only way to defend is to be very customer-focused, and offer the best experience to them. Are telcos doing that? Somewhat, but more can be done, for example, with better billing or roaming charges.\"\n\nSingTel, a major telco here, is well aware of the new competition in the digital space. It has identified new growth engines - mobile advertising, big data and mobile-led video service - for which telco assets such as \"trusted customer relationships\" and \"billing platforms\" give it a competitive advantage, said a spokeswoman.\n\n\"We're also actively partnering other telcos, vendors and research institutes, as well as investing in startups with the potential to disrupt adjacent technologies and their traditional operating models,\" she added.\n\nIt seems like nanu - with its technology and bold mission of ending phone bills as we know them - has readied itself to disrupt the telco industry. It launches on Android first, to be followed by iOS and other operating systems later this year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is the past reserves that the Constitution seeks to safeguard, especially through the powers vested in the President, he said.\n\n\"The GIC's mandate is to take risks aimed at achieving long-term returns, in full knowledge that the government's portfolio will be exposed to market risks that could mean weak returns or even declines in value on a mark-to-market basis for a time, before cycles reverse and values rebound,\" he said.\n\nGIC does not manage SSGS or CPF monies on its own, but rather a combined pool of government funds including a significant sum of unencumbered assets. \"This is why the GIC's mandate is to take calculated investments risks aimed at achieving good, long-term returns on the government's funds, without regard to the government's liabilities.\"\n\nMr Tharman noted that while GIC has achieved good returns over the long term, there were years where its returns have been low or even negative.\n\nThe Global Financial Crisis led to a significant reduction in GIC's annualised five-year return ended March 2013 to just 0.5 per cent in nominal Singapore dollar terms. A year later, the five-year annualised return rebounded strongly to 8.2 per cent in Singapore dollar terms, and this volatility was also seen in comparable market portfolios, said Mr Tharman.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For us the choice is: do we try to build 170 associates up to 5,000 associates? Or do we enter into a partnership with an already market-leading company that is well-established and highly respected?\"\n\nAs for PropNex, which enjoys a third of the market share here with some 31,000 transactions closed a year, it would also get to leverage on JLL's global reach, especially at a time when Singaporean buyers are eyeing overseas property investments to flee cooling measures at home. Meanwhile, developers are also casting their nets beyond Singapore's shores in search of foreign buyers to counter the poor buying sentiment here.\n\n\"This partnership will allow PropNex to bring some of the developers' projects regionally, working with JLL's Jakarta or China office ... to expose their properties, explaining to possible overseas investors that despite the ABSD (additional buyer's stamp duties), at today's discounted prices, it may still be a right time to enter the market,\" said PropNex CEO Mohamed Ismail.\n\nBeyond the residential market, there is also synergy to be made between PropNex's access to retail investors and JLL's numerous commercial strata-titled projects - another segment growing in popularity.\n\nThis announcement comes a month after four mid-sized property agencies - SLP International, OrangeTee, HSR International and Dennis Wee Realty - formed an alliance to rival the two largest players in the market, ERA Realty and PropNex Realty.\n\nSteven Tan, managing director of OrangeTee, sees the latest acquisition as a natural move and expects more consolidation in the industry going forward.\n\n\"It makes sense because in any industry, when the market size shrinks in a big way, businesses will consolidate to share resources and leverage on each other's network,\" he said.\n\nPropNex's Mr Ismail also believes that the consolidation trend is \"timely\".\n\n\"In any market, when there is a moment of challenge, the fittest will survive, the visionaries will think of solutions outside the box,\" he said. Consolidation is one such solution.\n\nJLL's Mr Fossick views the consolidations as emulations of the existing successful model in the market, that is, the likes of ERA and PropNex. \"It's all part of the same theme.\"\n\nJLL's initial 20 per cent stake in PropNex International may also just be \"phase one\", he said. \"If it succeeds as we expect it to, we will want to continue and grow the partnership because that's natural.\"\n\nMr Ismail added: \"We never say the 20-per-cent is the end of the road. The next step would ideally be to see whether the partnership adds value to our respective objectives. If this value-add process continues, the possibilities are much wider.\"\n\nAs for the four-agency alliance, Project Alliance Group has, since inception, sold more units at their existing projects and is now actively preparing to market their first joint projects - two executive condo projects - later this month, OrangeTee's Mr Tan shared.\n\nSeveral other small and mid-sized agencies have since also asked to join the alliance, but it is still deciding on their entry based on what each can offer in terms of expertise, network and size.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was due to an enlarged stapled security base after issuing 148.3 million new stapled securities to a unit of The Straits Trading Company and Golden Development (a member of Far East Organization) as part of the acquisition cost of Rendezvous Hotel Singapore (RHS) and Rendezvous Gallery.\n\nNet property income for the quarter edged down 1.3 per cent from the year before to S$26.6 million given lower hotel occupancies and average room rates.\n\nBut gross revenue for the period grew a marginal one per cent to S$29.6 million as Far East H-Trust recognised additional revenue from RHS, which was acquired in August last year.\n\nGerald Lee, chief executive officer of the Reit manager, noted that the occupancies at the property trust's hotels and serviced residences were affected by the weak macroeconomic environment and adverse factors impacting leisure travel. In particular, arrivals from China, Singapore's second-largest visitor market, were affected by a new restriction by the Chinese government on shopping tours and a decline in demand for Singapore-Malaysia-Thailand tour packages.\n\nFor the hotel portfolio, the average daily rate dipped 2 per cent from a year ago to S$188 in the second quarter as price competition intensified with slower demand for travel and an increased hotel rooms inventory. The serviced residences portfolio also saw lower occupancies during the quarter, resulting in a 5.5 per cent fall in average revenue per available unit to S$218.\n\nThe trust manager reckoned that although the expected supply of about 1,700 new hotel rooms this year is smaller compared to 3,300 last year, the operating environment for hospitality players will get more challenging going forward.\n\n\"We believe the renovation of our properties will place us in a better position to weather the near-term challenges,\" Mr Lee said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Analysts had predicted 359 million euros, based on the average of six estimates.\n\nIAG has eliminated 3,000 jobs at Iberia and scrapped its worst-performing operations while adding capacity at BA as chief executive officer Willie Walsh targets a 1.8 billion-euro operating profit by 2015.\n\nThe company reiterated a goal of lifting annual earnings by at least 500 million euros beyond 2013's 770 million euros, even after rivals cut targets.\n\n\"Iberia has taken significant steps to restructure its business and the progress made so far means that we can bring new long-haul aircraft into the airline's fleet,\" Mr Walsh said in a statement.\n\nThe Madrid-based unit will get eight Airbus Group NV A350-900 jets converted from options, as well as eight A330-200s, replacing 16 ageing A340 planes between 2015 and 2020.\n\nShares of IAG, as International Consolidated Airlines Group SA is known, have declined 17 per cent so far this year after more than doubling in price in 2013, valuing the company at \u00a36.75 billion (S$14.2 billion).\n\nIberia posted a second-quarter quarter profit of 16 million euros versus a year-earlier loss of 35 million euros, IAG said. Mr Walsh sealed the last of three pay settlements at the business in March, locking in more modest deals for pilots, ground-handling staff and cabin crew.\n\nBA earnings climbed 34 per cent to 332 million euros. The UK unit began flights to Austin, Texas, on March 3 and will deploy Airbus Group NV A380 superjumbos on flights to Washington from Sept 1 as it taps North Atlantic demand.\n\nBarcelona-based discount arm Vueling SA reported a three-month profit of 30 million euros.\n\n\"Our disciplined approach to capacity continues and we will make reductions where it makes sense as we go through the year,\" Mr Walsh said, adding that the company will trim 2014 winter capacity by about 3 percentage points. The CEO has retained IAG's earnings outlook after cuts at major competitors.\n\nAir France-KLM Group, Europe's biggest carrier by passenger traffic, almost tripled second-quarter operating profit to 238 million euros, it said on July 25 after trimming its full-year forecast to a range of 2.2 billion euros to 2.3 billion euros from as much as 2.5 billion euros previously.\n\nEarnings at Deutsche Lufthansa AG, the European No 2, fell 17 per cent to 359 million euros as overcapacity weighed on ticket prices, with the German company reiterated its forecast for a full-year figure of about one billion euros. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

After all, it is argued, the South American country has been locked out of capital markets for the past 13 years. So the latest dispute with two US hedge funds whose refusal to accept a write-down on debt Argentina defaulted on in 2001 would have consequences only for its own economy.\n\nCertainly, the country may have to devalue its currency to preserve its foreign currency reserves and that could trigger a rise in inflation that is already projected to hit 40 per cent. Even so, few expect that there will be anything like the riots and civil unrest that gripped the country in 2001, when it first defaulted on US$95 billion debt. Since then, the country has been paying its restructured debt instalments to 93 per cent of its bondholders. Its debt-to-GDP (gross domestic product) ratio is now about 40 per cent, well down from the 166 per cent it endured in 2001.\n\nHowever, unless the International Monetary Fund (IMF) comes up with an international treaty on sovereign debt defaults, there will be consequences for the global financial system, certainly over the longer term. As the IMF's chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, said: \"There's much more uncertainty as to how we'll be able to restructure debt for other countries in the future. So this really tells us that we need to work on improving resolution mechanisms.\" Indeed, the IMF proposed an international debt restructuring mechanism in 2003 but the plan had to be abandoned as the United States, the institution's largest stakeholder, was against it. As things stand, settlement of defaulted international loans depends on the vagaries of US and, to a lesser extent, European legal systems.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will reinforce for now the Federal Reserve's commitment to a gradualist policy approach,\" said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz in Newport Beach, California.\n\nJuly marked the sixth straight month that employment has expanded by more than 200,000 jobs, a stretch last seen in 1997. The one-tenth of a percentage point increase in the unemployment rate to 6.2 per cent came as more people entered the labour market, a sign of confidence in employment prospects.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had expected payrolls to increase 233,000 last month and the unemployment rate to hold steady at 6.1 per cent.\n\nAverage hourly earnings, which are being closely monitored as a potential signal of reduced slack that could prompt the Fed to raise rates, rose only one US cent.\n\nThat left the annual rate of increase at 2 per cent, still well below the levels that would make Fed officials nervous. Fed officials on Wednesday cautioned that \"significant\" slack remained, signalling patience on the rate front.\n\nA separate report from the Commerce Department showed inflation retreating in June. A price index for consumer spending, excluding food and energy, edged up 0.1 per cent after gaining 0.2 per cent in May.\n\nThe core personal consumption expenditures price index, which is the Fed's preferred inflation measure, increased 1.5 per cent in the 12 months till June, still below the central bank's 2 per cent target.\n\nMost economists are looking for the first interest rate increase in the second quarter of next year. The Fed has kept benchmark interest rates near zero since December 2008.\n\nThe cooling in hiring is unlikely to change perceptions about strong economic growth in the third quarter. \"It still points to a job market and an economy that is improving, but we also have the absence of wage pressures building, which is becoming another concern for investors,\" said Sean Lynch, managing director of global equity and research strategy at Wells Fargo Private Bank in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nThe economy grew at a 4 per cent annual pace in the second quarter after shrinking at a 2.1 per cent rate in the first three months of the year. While restocking by businesses lifted the figure, growth is seen remaining sturdy for the rest of 2014.\n\nThe jobless rate has declined from a peak of 10 per cent in October 2009, but much of the drop has been because Americans have left the workforce.\n\nThe labour force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, increased to 62.9 per cent in July after holding at 62.8 per cent for three consecutive months.\n\nThe job market took a step back last month. A broad measure of unemployment that includes people who want a job but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time jobs edged up to 12.2 per cent after hitting its lowest level since October 2008 in June.\n\nThe ranks of the long-term unemployed swelled last month, which will catch the attention of policymakers. The length of time that Americans are spending unemployed also rose in July after hitting its lowest level in more than five years in June.\n\nThe length of the average work week held steady at 34.5 hours.

That's a big challenge, compounded by reduced investment income after the global financial crisis.\"\n\nMr Rake is not alone in bemoaning the challenges faced by general insurers in Asia.\n\nInsurance broker Marsh said in its Asia Insurance Market Report 2014 that even as Asia has suffered some of the most devastating catastrophes, \"the insurance industry seems to be in a perpetual soft market, driven by new capital, new capacity, and fierce competition\".\n\nThis was despite an active typhoon season last year, with Typhoon Haiyan/Yolanda causing expected economic losses of more than US$10 billion compared to insured losses of US$700 million, according to reinsurer Munich Re.\n\nMarsh noted that rates in Japan have slipped back to pre-2011 levels, when an earthquake and tsunami devastated parts of the country and caused nuclear accidents. Rates in Thailand have also come back down to levels seen before its 2011 floods.\n\nNon-catastrophe property insurance is at historic lows. \"Local insurers continue to offer very attractive rates, in many cases more so than international insurers, creating intense competition in many markets,\" Marsh said.\n\nBrad Berg, head of energy and engineered risks, global property, at insurer AIG Asia Pacific, told BT that with governments flooding markets with liquidity since the 2008 financial crisis, insurers could provide greater coverage. Overall, rates are falling in natural catastrophe-prone areas, he said.\n\n\"The market needs to appropriately price risk for long-term sustainability. It is important for companies to get insurance from an organisation that sets prices with the long term in mind.\"\n\nIn Singapore, the insurance market is still growing but a bigger opportunity for growth is the offshore market, Zurich's Mr Rake said.\n\nThis refers to corporates from abroad getting insurance products and services from Singapore, which has the technical capability and financial capacity to support them. \"Singapore can be a hub market of choice for brokers to access insurance partners from.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For which month should I record my bill expenditure?\n\nA typical bill has a date that the bill was made, say July 20. I might receive the bill a few days later.\n\nBut the actual payment through Giro - the outward transfer of cash from my bank account - takes place two weeks later, in August.\n\nTo add to the confusion, the bill could be for services used in a previous month, say from June 14 to July 13.\n\n\"Should I record my handphone bill for the month when the money to pay it goes out of my bank account, or for the month when I receive the bill?\" I asked an accountant friend.\n\nHer reply was unequivocal. \"Record it in the month you get the bill.\"\n\n\"But the money hasn't gone out of my bank account yet!\" I protested.\n\nShe stuck to her guns. Expenses, once incurred, are recorded immediately in her books, whether payment has been made or not.\n\nIt was a mind-boggling concept. And I didn't understand it then, but it was my first introduction to the world of accrual accounting.\n\nPayback time\n\nWhat are accruals? The root word is to accrue, meaning to build up over time. This is typically used to describe the building up of a sum of money.\n\nFor example, if you withdraw a sum of money from your Central Provident Fund (CPF) to pay for a flat, the withdrawn sum still accrues at a 2.5 per cent interest rate - the interest one would have earned had the money not been taken out.\n\nThis accrued interest is typically paid back to one's own CPF account when the flat is sold.\n\nBecause you have to pay back something, I like to think of accruals in the karmic sense: what you do will come back and haunt you. Eventually, it'll be payback time.\n\nThis is like a Chinese martial warrior or Japanese samurai taking revenge on the bad guy who killed his master, 10 years later.\n\nIf you don't read Chinese martial arts novels or samurai manga, the appropriate Western cultural payback-time reference comes from The Princess Bride novel and movie. A fictional Spanish fencer whose father was killed by a nobleman finally takes revenge with his well-rehearsed oath of vengeance: \"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\"\n\nUnderstanding accruals\n\nAccruals are not just the bane of the nobleman whose life was in question. Investors who do not know any better often bear the brunt of an accounting system that, at first glance, is not very intuitive.\n\nNovice investors might be shocked by how easily the income statement, which they pay heavy attention to, can be manipulated.\n\nThe accrual system is not to blame - it is the best way a business can reflect its operations. But because managers can decide when to recognise revenue and expenses, investors must look beyond the income statement to evaluate a company's health.\n\nAccruals are recorded on a company's balance sheet. The easiest accrual concept to understand is a receivable, which is recorded when a sale is made but the customer cannot pay fully in cash immediately.\n\nThe Big Four\n\nIf a company's receivables keep increasing beyond the speed at which their revenues are growing, one can reasonably wonder if its customers plan to pay back their debts.\n\nBut an investor who does not look at accounts receivables will only see the increase in revenue.\n\nPayables, which is what a company owes suppliers, can also be manipulated to give the illusion of health. A company struggling with its cashflow can strike a deal to pay its suppliers later.\n\nThis increases operating cashflows in the short term, improving cashflow ratios. But in the long term, suppliers will still put pressure on the company to pay.\n\nThere are four other types of accrual-related accounts that can appear on a company's balance sheet: deferred revenue, accrued expenses, deferred expenses, and accrued revenue.\n\nDeferred or unearned revenue describes money received in exchange for a service that has yet to be fully delivered.\n\nFor example, Microsoft licenses its Windows, Office and other systems to companies for many years. A tech giant like Microsoft had US$25.2 billion of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2014. Investors can use that number to forecast how much revenue will be coming in the future.\n\nDeferred revenue is recorded as a liability, because this is a service owed. As the service gets delivered, the liability gets reduced, and revenue is recognised on the income statement.\n\nAlso on the liability side are accrued expenses. Companies accrue expenses when they commit to paying workers or utilities bills but have not actually paid out the cash yet.\n\nAs the wages get paid in later periods, this liability decreases together with cash on the asset side.\n\nOn the asset side, there are deferred or prepaid expenses, kept as assets until they are consumed.\n\nThis represents money that the company has paid for a service, for example advance rent, but the service is yet to be delivered.\n\nEarned money\n\nWhen the company first pays, an expense is not recognised, but the prepaid expense account goes up. When the company actually uses the service, say for insurance paid in advance, prepaid expenses fall while an expense is recognised on the income statement.\n\nFinally, accrued or unbilled revenue refers to money the company has earned by providing a service of some sort, and recognised in revenue, but has not yet billed the customer.\n\nThese are assets. Once the customer gets billed, the amount due gets shifted to accounts receivable, where it sits until cash payment comes in.\n\nDealing with accruals\n\nAll this can be very confusing when you encounter it for the first time.\n\nBut knowing about accruals might allow you to predict the earnings potential of your stock.\n\nA landmark study was done in 1996 by Richard Sloan, then with the University of Pennsylvania. He found the so-called \"accrual anomaly\", where share prices of companies with low accruals outperformed companies with large accruals, due to the earnings of companies with large accruals reversing and sparking a selloff. It sparked a wave of studies and hedge funds trading on this strategy.\n\nBut calculating accruals requires some work.\n\nYou have to subtract total non-debt liabilities from total non-cash-and-investments assets. You can also subtract cash flows from operations and investments from net income (essentially, stripping net income of free cash flow) to get a sense of accruals.\n\nTo compare between companies, you can make an accrual ratio by dividing the difference between this and last year's accruals by the average accrual level in these two years.\n\nIf accruals or accrual ratios are increasing or are higher than industry peers, it is worth thinking whether the company has quality earnings.\n\nHey, we never said this was going to be easy. It's accrual, cruel world.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/property/compliance-costs-boost-loan-outsourcing", "site_title": "Compliance costs boost loan outsourcing", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nCompliance costs boost loan outsourcing\n\nBanks exit mortgage business as new rules push up costs\n\nPublished Mon, Aug 4, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[BOSTON] As banks lose money on mortgages and retreat from the business, PHH Corp, the biggest US outsourcer of home loans, is rushing to cash in.\n\nPHH processes and originates mortgages on behalf of small banks and some of the world's largest financial firms, including Morgan Stanley and HSBC Holdings plc. PHH chief executive officer Glen Messina is so convinced he can make money where others can't that in July he sold the company's cash-producing fleet management unit and plans to plough the proceeds into mortgages.\n\nLenders are backing away from home loans as an array of new regulations in the aftermath of the housing crash push up compliance costs. Banks lost an average US$194 a mortgage in the first quarter, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The losses may spur banks to increase outsourcing of home loans by US$180 billion a year while keeping their brand name on the mortgage, Mr Messina said on a July 8 call with analysts.\n\n\"The biggest banks have the resources to implement the new regulations, but if you're a smaller bank or a wealth manager, it may not make sense to invest in all that infrastructure,\" said Bose George, a mortgage analyst at Keefe, Bruyette and Woods Inc in New York. \"The risks are too high for companies to lend without a very high level of compliance expertise.\"\n\nInvestors drove up PHH's share price 12 per cent to US$23.78 on May 21 when Mr Messina announced the company was in talks to sell the profitable corporate car and truck fleet unit. That was the biggest jump in more than two years for Mount Laurel, New Jersey-based PHH. The stock has since pared that gain, retreating to US$23.31 on Friday.\n\nMr Messina, who spent 17 years in executive positions GE's retail finance, mortgage and equipment management businesses, said on the July call that PHH would net about US$821 million from the sale, after taxes and transaction costs. About US$450 million will go to repurchasing shares, US$200 million will be used for debt reduction, and the rest will be spent on expanding its mortgage operation with acquisitions and investments in technology, he said.\n\nMr Messina said the goal for PHH, which also services home loans, is to increase lending to US$80 billion a year. That would be a 57 per cent increase from 2013's volume for PHH, which in the first quarter was the sixth-largest US lender.\n\n\"We are seeing a meaningful increase in demand from regional community banks looking for an outsourcing solution,\" Mr Messina said in July. \"We think our model plays very well in this part of the cycle.\"\n\nThe sale of the fleet-management business, which leaves PHH dependent on the mortgage market, comes with risks. Without a steady stream of income from the unit, which accounted for 58 per cent of PHH's 2013 revenue, the company will be vulnerable to mortgage-market volatility, Jeffrey Zaun and Stephen Lynch of Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC said in a report last month.\n\nPHH may not post a profit until the second half of 2015, the analysts said, as they lowered the company's rating to B+ from BB- while upgrading its outlook to stable.\n\nPHH was to report second-quarter earnings after the close of the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. The company probably was to post a loss of US$7.4 million, according to the average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg poll, because of a decline in revenue as the mortgage market contracts. That compares with a profit of US$90 million in the year-earlier period. For the year, PHH probably will lose US$39.2 million before earning a profit of US$28.5 million in 2015, according to the Bloomberg poll.\n\nIn January, the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau implemented more than 1,800 pages of new mortgage regulations stemming from the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. The rules include strict standards for the documentation of income, assets and employment.\n\nThe cost of originating a mortgage rose to a record US$6,253 in the first quarter, up 21 per cent from the end of 2013, according to MBA, the industry's largest trade group. The US$194 net loss per loan in the first quarter compares with a profit of US$150 in the fourth quarter.\n\nBanks have slashed their lending staffs to the lowest level since 2001, the beginning of the real estate boom. In June, they had 1.7 million lending employees after the number declined for 12 consecutive months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nBanks shrinking or exiting their mortgage businesses will turn to outsourcing because they still want to offer home financing to attract customers, said Keith Gumbinger, vice-president of HSH.com, a mortgage-data website based in Riverdale, New Jersey.\n\n\"Compliance is eating up lending profits, but banks need those mortgage customers for cross-selling their other services,\" Mr Gumbinger said. \"You have to bare your financial soul to get a mortgage, and that's information banks can use to see if you are a potential customer for a credit card or investment products.\"\n\nPHH's size - it has about 6,000 employees and is the second-largest non-bank lender by volume after Quicken Loans Inc - makes it easier to carry the regulatory burden. PHH, which handles every step of the loan process for its clients, sells 80 per cent of its mortgages to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae.\n\nIn many cases, customers never know their bank has outsourced their loan to PHH because all the work, even answering the phone, is done using the bank's name. \"We have the benefit of scale and the spreading across multiple clients. That enables us to achieve a level of economics, and an investment in compliance\" that banks find too costly to make, Mr Messina said.\n\nAs compliance costs surge, Mr Messina also faces the challenge of having to renegotiate existing outsourcing contracts, said Paul Miller, managing partner and bank analyst with FBR Capital Markets Corp in Arlington, Virginia.\n\n\"PHH's compliance costs went up too, so just as they hope the new regulations will spur more banks to outsource, they are dealing with the same issue when it comes to multi-year contracts negotiated in the old regulatory environment,\" Mr Miller said. \"They won't make money until their existing contracts are profitable.\"\n\nPHH was spun off in 2005 from Cendant Corp, which at the time was the largest US real estate company. The following year, Cendant spun off Realogy Holding Corp, now the largest US real estate brokerage, and Wyndham Worldwide Corp, a hotel franchiser. The remaining car rental business became Avis Budget Group and the Cendant name was retired.\n\nWhile outsourcing accounts for about 67 per cent of PHH originations, it also makes home loans through a joint venture with Realogy, which has more than 700 real estate offices and is the franchiser of the Century 21, Coldwell Banker and Better Home and Gardens brands. PHH is the exclusive name that Realogy brokers recommend to clients needing a mortgage, according to PHH regulatory filings.\n\nAbout 29 per cent of PHH's outsourced lending is on behalf of Merrill Lynch, a division of Bank of America Corp, and 12 per cent is for Morgan Stanley, according to the filings. PHH also handles US mortgage processing for HSBC Holdings plc, Europe's largest bank.\n\n\"PHH is a very low-profile company, what I call white label because their core business is originating under someone else's name,\" said Mr George, the KBW analyst. \"The costs and the complexity of making a loan today has grown so much, there may be more brand names that want someone else to do their lending for them.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Property\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM", "images": []}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/commonwealth-games-uncertain-future", "site_title": "Commonwealth Games' uncertain future", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nCommonwealth Games' uncertain future\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Aug 1, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT'S a question that is raised every four years whenever the Commonwealth Games rolls around. Does anyone really care?\n\nGranted, this sporting event doesn't quite have the grandeur of the Summer Olympics or the mass appeal of the Fifa World Cup, but it is certainly an important fixture in the sporting calendar for the thousands of athletes in the Commonwealth that train hard in a bid to bring glory to their countries.\n\nThe 11-day extravaganza got underway in the Scottish city of Glasgow last week and will wrap up tomorrow, bringing to an end an event involving some 6,500 athletes from 71 countries competing in 17 different sports.\n\nI've been following much of the action on TV, with round-the-clock coverage beamed on seven different channels. I've enjoyed watching our dominant table tennis stars battle their way to another haul of medals, and cheered when shooters Jasmine Ser and Teo Shun Xie romped to a gold medal each in their respective events.\n\nSingapore is also guaranteed the gold and silver medals in the table tennis women's singles competition, with a possible bronze too as our paddlers looked to complete a clean sweep in the gold and bronze medal matches (played at press time).\n\nSwimmer Joseph Schooling, the proud winner of the Republic's first-ever Commonwealth Games medal - and a silver one too, at that - in the sport, will give everyone hope that he will be a genuine medal contender at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nWe've also seen some bright new talents emerge onto the international sporting scene, such as 13-year-old Erraid Davies, who became the youngest ever medal winner for Scotland in the Commonwealth Games when she won the bronze in the para-100m breaststroke final. While the Commonwealth Games doesn't quite have a unique brand or identity to speak of, unlike other major sporting events, it is heartening that the crowds have turned out in force for the bulk of the events in Glasgow over the past week. Over a million tickets were snapped up by locals and thousands of visitors, with many of the popular events such as athletics, aquatics and boxing completely sold out.\n\nEven with so many inspiring stories unravelling in Glasgow, the future of the Games continues to hang in the balance as people continue to question its significance in the modern sporting world.\n\nThere is talk that interest is fast fading as far as bidding for the Games in 2022 and beyond is concerned. The 2018 edition will be held in Australia, after Queensland beat the only other bid city, Hambantota of Sri Lanka. At the recent Commonwealth Games Federation press conference at the end of its General Assembly, outgoing chief executive Mike Hooper played down speculation that some cities have been reluctant to bid for the 2022 Games after the problem-plagued event in New Delhi four years ago.\n\nAs things stand, only Durban (South Africa) and Edmonton (Canada) have publicly expressed an interest, with the March 2015 deadline to submit a bid looming large. Cost is one significant concern. Scotland has shelled out over US$1 billion to host this year's Games.\n\nIndia blew its budget big time when it spent US$8.5 billion in 2010, only to end up with a huge debt, stadiums that have turned into white elephants, and even several lawsuits. Auckland had considered bidding for the 2018 rights but pulled out after the New Zealand government estimated that it would lose about NZ$583 million (S$616.9 million) if it did so.\n\nEach of the Commonwealth nations must also decide how much to invest in their sportsmen and women to send them to an event that, for some of them, amounts to their one and only chance to perform on a global stage.\n\nSome countries have also said that they no longer identify with the \"Commonwealth\" aspect of the event since they are no longer defined by the British empire any more. One of the biggest challenges facing a host city is the ability to attract the world's top athletes to participate. Household names such as Usain Bolt, Asafa Powell, Stephanie Rice and long-distance runner Kaster Semenya all withdrew from the Delhi Games. Bolt is in Glasgow but he will only take part in the 4x100m relay and not the individual events. Some of the world's largest corporates have also stayed away from the Commonwealth Games because of a lack of a global audience.\n\nUnfortunately, the Games take place in a day and age when so many global sporting events are competing for the attention of fans and sponsorship dollars. Glasgow has shown that a well-run event can pull in the crowds and boost the profile of the city in the process.\n\nNow it is up to Queensland and the future host cities, however many there might be, to run with the ball and ensure the flame of the Commonwealth Games continues to burn.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Debbie Yong\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Aug 1, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nDON'T ask Dan Hunter to define Australian cuisine, things may get touchy.\n\n\"Australia is a huge continent, not just a country. The food in the north is very different from what you get in the south, which is tropical,\" he says. \"We often talk about regionality in Europe or Asia, and no one expects the food that you eat in Spain to be the same as what you get in Russia, but people forget that it is about the same distance from Melbourne to Queensland.\"\n\nIt sounds ironic, coming from the chef-owner of Brae, which opened last December, because he's widely revered as a definitive name in modern Australian cuisine, chiefly for his paddock-to-plate cooking ethos and his use of distinctly Australian ingredients.\n\nYour A$180 (S$209) prix fixe meal at his 50-seat restaurant in Birregurra, just outside of Melbourne, might consist, for instance, of a wallaby tartare paired with flaxseed wafers and nettle butter, a dry-aged jumbuck with herbed mayonnaise and anchovy juice, or crunchy beef tendons dusted with a fleck of tonsil-tickling native pepperberry. It's not just about slapping obscure desert spices onto slabs of kangaroo, however. There's an art to it - and it often lies in the nuances, he says.\n\n\"Often you find that once you start to use something indigenous, another indigenous product tends to go with it,\" says Chef Hunter. Desert fruits such as the quandong, or desert peach, weren't traditionally farmed for a long time, so they tend to be quite astringent or bitter, but they are similar to rhubarb, so he chooses to pair them with gamey meats such as wallaby, for example.\n\n\"It's about finding the right way to use them through trial and error. But if you don't use them, you'll never find the right way to use them,\" says Chef Hunter, who is constantly foraging for new additions to his local larder too. Twice a week, his kitchen team is despatched down to the Great Ocean Road - just 25m from the restaurant - to harvest edible seaweeds and coastal plants from various spots.\n\nHis favourite ingredient? The humble fungi. He explains: \"Mushrooms are very seasonal and highly elusive. They're some of the most exciting things to find because you may have to walk for miles to find a wild one, and there's no way you can find the same quality in the marketplace - they don't store or travel well. They are the real benchmarks of seasonality: they don't speak of a whole season, they speak of a day.\"\n\nThe rest of the produce is largely cultivated on the restaurant's 30-acre site and sourced from trusted organic growers. Together with two friends in the building industry, Chef Hunter acquired the site last year from a couple who previously ran restaurant and cooking school Sunnybrae for over 20 years on the site. Brae means hillside in Scottish as the area was a settlement for early immigrants from Scotland.\n\nThe property now houses a grove of 100 olive trees, a fruit orchard with over 180 fruit trees, including 30 citrus trees, 12 varieties of apples, six types of pears, and eight types of peaches. There's livestock too: A further 10 acres of the land has been set aside for rearing about 50 lambs, while a moveable \"chicken tractor\" is rotated around the fields to fertilise them, and the 40 chickens yield about 200 eggs weekly.\n\n\"If you want to cook food that is flavoursome - because after all the creativity in the world, if it doesn't taste good, then what's the point, really? - you need to be aware of the way food deteriorates and how to manage that the best. And to do that, for me, is to be working where it grows,\" says the Mugaritz-trained chef of his decision to open his first independent venture in the countryside.\n\nBesides, it's not like he hasn't done it before. Before Brae, Chef Hunter helmed the kitchen of the Royal Mail Hotel, where he gained prominence for transforming an anonymous hotel dining room three hours outside of Melbourne into an obligatory three-hatted destination for gastronomic pilgrims.\n\n\"Royal Mail was a bit of a risk, but I also thought, I've got nothing to lose, so let's try. Off the back of that reputation it's much easier to do this now, and much closer to Melbourne,\" he says. Three daily train connections link the restaurant to the city or, if you are so inclined, there's also a helicopter landing area at the back of the restaurant.\n\n\"Just chopping and cooking in a kitchen for 18 hours a day leaves you a bit hollow. There's more to know. You can work for 50 years as a cook and still learn every day, there's new stuff to be shared constantly,\" the chef-turned-farmer observes of his double duty in both kitchen and garden, adding bashfully, \"you could say we are still amateurs\".\n\nOne of his early lessons learnt: that a good ingredient starts from the soil, not just the seed. \"People are so obsessed with finding a good seed and growing that, but without good soil you can't grow it.\"\n\nThis means creating their own compost from kitchen scraps at Brae, and constantly tuning \"soil recipes\" to keep the soil's acidity, texture, moisture levels in balance.\n\n\"We want to have a restaurant where we can serve strawberries that are still warm from being picked in the sunset just an hour before,\" he states. \"These are strawberries that will never ever be in a market place because they are so fragile. Unfortunately, in the commercial supermarket supply chain these days, a strawberry has the texture of an apple. The food we consume has been so modified over time to suit big markets.\"\n\n\"Even as a cook, you can feel the difference when you put a knife into something in its raw state. If you cut a zucchini straight off from the fields, just the sound of a knife going through it is so different from the one that you get from the shops.\"\n\nTo offer a fully immersive back-to-the-roots experience at Brae, Chef Hunter is working on building six one-bedroom luxury apartments on a further five acres of the property.\n\nThe designs will be based on traditional Australian forest huts and may feature retractable roofs for stargazing. \"We aren't a hotel with a restaurant, but a restaurant with rooms. Cooking is still our priority,\" he says of the project, targeted for completion by Christmas 2015. An existing garden shed will additionally be converted into a retail store for his farm-fresh produce, and a bakery will feature heirloom wheat varieties and pastries baked in a traditional stone oven.\n\nThe stuff of envy for most chefs, it would seem. Is he living the dream? \"Everyone says that, but once you start to see the annual planning, the spreadsheets of vegetable yields, the diagrams of gardens that we have to do, that's a whole other job,\" Chef Hunter laughs. \"When it comes to doing the work, nobody wants to do it.\"\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\n@DebbieYongBT\n\nTomatoes and ice plant in sea water\n\n(serves 4)\n\nIngredients\n\n6-8 large sun ripened heirloom tomatoes\n\n900g mussels, scrubbed clean and without barnacles.\n\n650g water\n\nZest of one lemon\n\nVinaigrette\n\n500g tomato pulp\n\n5g sugar\n\n1g salt\n\n160g strained tomato water\n\n20g arbequina olive oil\n\n12g aged muscatel vinegar\n\n20g arbequina olive oil\n\n12g aged muscatel vinegar chopped chives\n\n24 ice plant leaves in varying sizes\n\nMethod\n\nFor the tomatoes\n\nSlice each tomato into two even slices around 1.5 cm thick.\n\nSeason with mineral salt (Murray River) and leave on a tray until needed.

Mr Na replaces Patrick Fung, Wing Hang Bank's current chairman and CEO, who will remain as Wing Hang's non-executive chairman. Mr Fung is also a son of the late Y K Fung who founded the bank.\n\nMr Na, 58, was for a decade the deputy president director of Bank OCBC NISP, OCBC's Indonesian banking unit. There, he was instrumental in driving the corporate banking business, successfully transferring customer and product solutions from Singapore and Malaysia to Indonesia. Mr Na also spearheaded the collaborative efforts between OCBC and OCBC NISP across business functions such as corporate banking, consumer banking, treasury, risk management as well as operations and technology.\n\nMr Na joined OCBC in 1990 as the general manager of its Hong Kong branches. He has since also been involved in the bank's operations in Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan.\n\nWith effect from yesterday, a number of Wing Hang's directors - Cheng Hon Kwan, Li Sze Kuen Billy, Brian Gerard Rogan, Stephen Dubois Lackey, Ho Chi Wai Louis, and Fung Yuk Sing Michael - have also resigned, attributing their resignations to the change in control of the bank.\n\nOCBC shares corrected from a consecutive seven-day climb to finish six Singapore cents, or 0.6 per cent, lower at S$9.92 yesterday.

Not so much like a bad penny but a less grating, non-cartoon version of Singa the courtesy lion waving the national flag and imploring you to pledge solidarity with local cuisine, if not kindness.\n\nWillin Low is the poster boy of modern Singapore cuisine - the go-to guy whenever the tourism board needs someone to bridge the cultural gap between bak chor mee and the Western world. He's the one who turns exotica such as laksa leaves into Caucasian-familiar pesto, and uses his lawyer-enhanced vocabulary to extol the virtues of heritage cooking more eloquently than a Wee Nam Kee chicken rice representative.\n\nEven if you never bought into the concept of kueh bolu tiramisu made by replacing sponge fingers with the local snack (sponge cake is sponge cake by any other language), props have to go to Low for pioneering the mod-Sin movement. Thanks to him and the likes of Malcolm Lee and Damian D'Silva, a new breed of young chefs can find inspiration in their own backyard rather than a Ferran Adria cookbook.\n\nNow, after a brief hiatus and a bespoke overhaul of Wild Rocket's premises at the newly spruced-up boutique-budget hotel Hangout@mt.\n\nemily, Low is back with renewed vigour and a tighter, more confident menu.\n\nPreviously, you could argue that Wild Rocket's cuisine walked the fine line between contrivance and genuine idea. Where is the value in reworking a simple seafood porridge by compacting soft rice grains into a ball that sits in a clear broth, topped with an egg emulsion and fried shallots and charging $18 for the conceit? Low is still prone to such literal translations, but less so now. Most of the dishes reflect a maturity of thought and a clearer narrative - there's less of a slavish need to mimic original ingredients without actually asking why. The result is food that tastes good and stands on its own, even without referencing the original inspiration.\n\nStill, a first glance of the new menu might make you think Low has moved beyond mod-Sin towards broader spectrum mod-Asian, given the Thai, Cambodian and even Japanese influences in the limited range of dishes on offer. One of them, pomelo salad with tiger prawns and frozen coconut dressing ($17) is not new but is nonethless an inspired creation that turns the Thai staple on its head with the ingenious idea of churning the savoury coconut milk-based dressing into an icecream. The frozen dressing keeps the salad components chilled while melting to bond with the sweet and spicy melange of pomelo segments, mint, green beans, crispy garlic and dried cranberries. It's a circus of activity in the mouth, and totally enjoyable.\n\nOf less interest is the garden variety chilli crab pasta ($32) - which packs both familiarity and blaseness in the same tomato-ey bite - and the aforementioned existentialist seafood congee ($18) where a bite-sized rice ball ponders its reason for sitting in a tepid broth prematurely cooled by the amped-up air-conditioning, with skinny slivers of swimmer crab meat and shrimp.\n\nMeanwhile, the salmon red rice and baby octopus donburi ($18) is a head-scratcher - chewy unpolished rice cooked in overly sweet teriyaki-like sauce, topped with pale thin slices of salmon sashimi, crunchy tobiko roe and fish crumbs that's a victim of overthinking. You're better off with the more restrained snapper in a fragrant kaffir leaf-infused curry-like Cambodian amok sauce. The only setback is the fish, which is cooked sous-vide and briefly pan-seared for a silky texture and a crisp skin, but is compromised on flavour.\n\nWhere Low shines is with his omakase ($118) - a chef's menu served at the counter by Low himself, adding personableness and homespun story-telling to a roll call of mod-Sin creations. A star of the show would be Low's interpretation of salted egg yolk crab - a very well-executed panko-crusted crab cake with 100 per cent pure swimmer crab meat and no fillers, sitting on a bed of salted egg crumble that mimics the granular texture of cooked crab roe. It's a shining example of clever re-interpretation, as opposed to gimmicky re-arranging.\n\nWhile his version of the takeaway classic Singaporean fried noodles is really sakura ebi pasta - the umami-rich al dente noodles tossed in a failsafe triumvirate of toasty shrimp oil, dried Japanese shrimp and minced konbu is still a winner. On the other hand, the jury is still out on the laksa risotto - an agreeable if heavy-going spice odyssey that gets a surprising garnish in the form of a lobe of sea urchin. On the plus side, the risotto gets a jolt of rich creamy brininess but at the same time, it also amplifies the uni's less-than-stellar quality. But we had no problem agreeing that Low's dessert of pineapple sorbet and vacuum-cooked pineapple chunks dusted with sugar, chilli powder and soya sauce crystals - an update of his father's favourite snack of pineapples with chilli and soya sauce - is one heck of an idea.\n\nThe path of re-invention isn't smooth, but it sure beats sticking to the tried and true. If Low stays the course, and matches that with his endearing sense of patriotism - a Singapore culinary brand is definitely in the making.\n\nRating:\n\n7\n\nWHAT OUR RATINGS MEAN\n\n10: The ultimate dining experience\n\n9-9.5: Sublime\n\n8-8.5: Excellent\n\n7-7.5: Good to very good\n\n6-6.5: Promising\n\n5-5.5: Average\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Should the curbs be relaxed soon?\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Aug 3, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTan Chong Huat\n\nManaging Partner\n\nRHTLaw Taylor Wessing LLP\n\nTHE property cooling measures have helped to curb the excesses of an active property market, both in terms of price and volume. The consequences could have been unthinkable if the Monetary Authority of Singapore had not intervened. These measures should be viewed from a long-term perspective, as it is now less likely that Singaporeans will experience the bursting of a property bubble.\n\nHowever, government intervention can never be a permanent solution in a free market economy. The difficulty is determining the right time to relax the curbs. Currently, potential investors may be deterred from entering the market in light of the falling property prices and the TDSR (total debt servicing ratio) framework.\n\nOne unintended consequence may have been the spike in property investments overseas. The TDSR framework does not apply to such investments and it may lead to a case of the rich becoming richer, as they can use overseas property to obtain financing from banks outside Singapore.\n\nPauline Goh\n\nManaging Director\n\nCB Richard Ellis Singapore\n\nTHE Total Debt Servicing Framework (TDSR) framework has paved the way for a property market with stronger fundamentals, supported by a pool of genuine, credit-worthy buyers who are able to meet their debt obligations. In the long run, the market will be better protected from forced sales as owners are presumably able to weather the current price correction. The latest statistics from the Urban Redevelopment Authority show that new home sales in the post-TDSR period (July 2013 to June 2014) were about half the volume in the pre-TDSR period (July 2012 to June 2013). This shows that the TDSR framework, combined with the measures introduced earlier (SSD, ABSD, LTV, etc), has been effective in dousing the exuberance of borderline investors and speculators. As a result, the government has achieved what it set out to do. Price-wise, the pre-TDSR period saw the URA price index climb by 4.1 per cent while the post-TDSR period saw a correction of 2.8 per cent. Developers continue to hold prices steady at about S$1 million for mass market homes, meeting high acquisition costs by readjusting unit sizes to keep homes affordable. For the whole of 2014, CBRE expects 8,000-9,000 new homes to be sold and the URA price index to soften by 4 per cent to 6 per cent.\n\nArsh Chaudhry\n\nExecutive Managing Director\n\nCushman and Wakefield\n\nI DON'T believe that the Singapore market is over-regulated. Real estate is an asset class that should provide steady capital growth and cashflow stability. We had reached a stage in the market where speculative activity was overtaking real demand and investors were over-extending themselves to enter the market.\n\nToday, there is tremendous liquidity in the market waiting on the sidelines, ready to take positions at the right price points. Interest rates also continue to remain low and will probably remain that way for 9-12 more months. Therefore, I can't see a reason for the government to relax the cooling measures at this stage.\n\nI also do not see the market going through a chaotic correction. On the back of strong economic growth fundamentals and locational attractiveness, the medium- to long-term prospects of real estate as an asset class in Singapore are extremely positive.\n\nJack Chua\n\nCEO\n\nERA Singapore\n\nPROPERTY prices have been moderating and stabilising. We are seeing most transactions being done at market value, reflective of a willing seller, willing buyer environment. Properties are no longer sold at large premiums over valuation.\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has maintained its stand that it is still early days to tweak any of the cooling measures. Therefore, we can expect the moderation in property prices to continue into 2015. Volumes are likely to be flat.\n\nCurrently, the main measures affecting the public and private markets are the Mortgage Servicing Ratio of 30 per cent and the Total Debt Servicing Ratio of 60 per cent. These measures are very effective in preventing buyers from over-extending themselves by taking on too many loans. Essentially those who are not able to obtain the required financing or who do not possess the required equity are out of the market.\n\nWith hardly any excessive buying or speculation going on, I hope the government will review the need or tweak the requirements for Additional Buyers' Stamp Duty and the Sellers' Stamp Duty. There is a general sense among industry players that the government may have indeed over-regulated.\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nI AM inclined to agree with MAS that it may be too soon to relax the property cooling measures. Property prices have soared about 60 per cent since the global financial crisis in 2009 but have only dipped marginally since the seven rounds of cooling measures were implemented. Cash-over-valuations (COVs) may have dropped significantly but overall property prices are still at relatively high levels - against a backdrop of sale volumes that are still holding up and even surging from Q1 to Q2 this year. This shows that demand is still there and, with the current low interest rate environment, relaxing the curbs now will probably cause more investors to flood back to the market, which will drive prices up again.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPLAN-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\nTHE property cooling measures have certainly triggered a market slowdown. That property developers are calling for a review of the cooling measures is an indication that the industry is reaching the threshold of unbearable pain. MAS is right not to relax the measures now. Its assessment that the market is only now just beginning to see an orderly correction is correct, given that prices are still high, especially the prices of private homes, which have climbed about 60 per cent since the global financial crisis in 2009. Buying volume has also shot up, despite a slide in prices, which still remain high. I am in favour of the government's intervention to cool the property market to prevent a bubble from developing. If a bubble forms and then bursts, the consequences will be more dire than the status quo.\n\nThe measures are also justified when we consider the larger objective of making properties more affordable to those who genuinely need a home. The measures have been effective in restraining speculators from playing in the property market, given the higher upfront costs and TDSR. The government has shown that it will intervene when there is a need, for the larger good. In this regard, I do not think the property market is over-regulated. The government must intervene to bring about an orderly correction. The cooling measures have shown that the demand for property is not inelastic. Property developers will have to be more circumspect when bidding for land or en bloc sales.\n\nAnne Tong\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nHSR International Realtors Pte Ltd\n\nTHE intention of the cooling measures is not to cause a crash in the property market, but rather to prevent a bubble in the market. The purpose is to find the equilibrium in the market where prices are maintained at a reasonable level for upgraders to reach and for investors to still see good returns from a mid- to long-term investment. In our opinion, the measures have been effective for its purpose and to curb speculation. The overall impact of the property cooling measures has been a slowed-down pace of sales and home prices have been brought down to an affordable level for the lower to middle-income home buyers. Currently what we have is a healthy market as prices adjust downwards gradually. Recent figures have shown that buyers are gaining interest in the local market as prices continue to adjust downwards. It might be premature to relax the cooling measures just yet and further monitoring by the government is necessary.\n\nDennis Yeo\n\nManaging Director\n\nColliers International\n\nTHE government has rolled out several rounds of regulatory measures over the past five years. Its objective has always been to prevent speculation in the residential market and to prevent prices from running out of control to unsustainable levels. Of all the regulatory measures introduced, the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) has proved to be the most effective. Perhaps when the market shows clear signs of stability - it is too early now, considering that prices surged 62 per cent from the market bottom in 2009 and corrected by just 3.2 per cent over the past three quarters - the Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) could be systematically tweaked, so that property transaction volume can flow in line with our economic growth. In addition, given how the TDSR has helped to rein in runaway prices and curtail speculative activity, the ABSD now has inflationary implications for the residential market. After all, to a buyer, not only does he have to pay the price of the new home, he must also factor in the ABSD, on top of forking out a larger cash quantum upfront. There is no necessity to additionally tax those who can afford and who aspire to own properties for investment.\n\nToby Koh\n\nGroup Managing Director\n\nAdemco Security Group Pte Ltd\n\nTHE cooling measures have been effective in moderating the property bubble to a certain degree. However, prices are still high as compared with the slight southern move in recent quarters. One of the primary goals to reduce household debt ratios has also been successful. The conservative and measured approach by the government is rational and sensible. I do not believe that the curbs should be lifted any time soon. In fact, with the low interest rates available and liquidity amassing, any lifting of curbs is likely to send property prices soaring within a short time. I am sure when the curbs are eventually lifted, the government will ease the measures in small steps so as not to negate all the efforts over the past year.\n\nMohd Ismail\n\nCEO\n\nPropNex Realty\n\nTHE furious pace of several rounds of cooling measures in quick succession since 2009 has been reflected in weak sales for both the private and public sectors in Q2 2014. Both the TDSR and ABSD have worked in tandem to reduce demand and bring prices down. If some of these measures are not tweaked, prices will continue to slide and there will also be a supply glut due to increased unsold inventory.\n\nNo doubt prices have risen 60 per cent since 2009, but this is not the fault of homebuyers. Yet if prices continually fall, those who bought their properties at the peak will be severely impacted, with some possibly even having to go through a bank foreclosure.\n\nIt has also been reported that Singaporean investment in overseas property has risen from S$1.4 billion to S$2 billion last year. The rise in appeal of overseas property investment was brought about largely by the 7 per cent ABSD on Singaporeans who buy their second property. There's also the 15 per cent ABSD on foreigners for their property purchases here.\n\nThe public housing market also looks bleak with prices expected to drop by up to 20 per cent in the next two years. Many HDB owners will be disgruntled. What we need is sustainable price growth, and not measures to artificially bring prices down along with an increased supply of flats.\n\nPerhaps some measures, such as the ABSD, could be systematically tweaked, so that the volume of property transactions in Singapore can move in tandem with economic growth. This could help to negate the possible longer-term effects of funds flowing out of the country and foreign funds bypassing Singapore to other markets. In addition, we can then also ensure that all Singaporeans have a retirement asset that will continually appreciate in value.\n\nRobin C Lee\n\nGroup COO\n\nBok Seng Group\n\nIT is good to note that the prices of Singapore properties have successfully eased since the implementation of the various cooling measures. With property prices escalating more than 60 per cent within a short span of the past five years, any further increase would not bode well for Singapore's economic or social health. The respite in the past few quarters is only transient, however, given the liquidity in the market as more money continues to flow into the economy. It is not surprising that despite the cooling measures on property purchasing, the volume has not slowed drastically, which simply highlights the volatility of the market. At the same time, the fact remains that, regrettably, there are limited avenues to park all the excess funds at near-zero interest rate. The Singapore property market, under a stable government with great economic and infrastructural development plan for the next decade, cannot afford to be an erroneous investment bet. In my view, it is perhaps better to keep the measures for a while more and allow the real market demand to be revealed while the world regains some economic sanity in the next one to two years.\n\nAnnie Yap\n\nManaging Director\n\nAYP Associates Pte Ltd\n\nAS the Monetary Authority of Singapore noted, the cooling measures have been effective in helping to slow down the increase in household debt from about 13 per cent during the third quarter of 2011 to 5.5 per cent in Q1 of this year. Nonetheless, it is still too early to relax the property curbs. Property prices have risen by more than 60 per cent over the past four years, but declined by only 3.3 per cent in the past three quarters. Furthermore, global interest rates are still low and relaxation of the property curbs might lead to significant price increases once again. There are a few benefits in keeping property prices low: First, it will prevent buyers from over-borrowing to invest in property. Second, it will ensure that property purchases are kept affordable for genuine homebuyers, without speculators or investors ramping up prices.\n\nChris Comer\n\nCEO and Property Developer\n\nCastlewood Group\n\nIN every market intervention, there are time lags between the time when problems are identified, to when regulations take effect. The property cycle is no different. These property cooling measures are only just beginning to take effect, and while we are starting to see a minute slide in prices, property purchase is still largely unaffordable to the average Singaporean. At this stage it is necessary to maintain the curbs to continue to bring down the inflated prices to a reasonable level. Relaxing the curbs now would be premature. Castlewood Group identified this inevitable stage of the property cycle more than 12 months ago, and I'd venture to forecast that it will be well until 2015 before investors and aspiring home owners can begin to find prices to be more affordable.\n\nFor investors, this could be a crucial time where it seems like the market is constantly in flux, and snap decision-making can be difficult and costly. When carefully researched and chosen, property investments can be both extremely resilient and profitable amid market volatility, so investors should consider alternative options such as hotel and overseas investments that are more affordable than the currently over-priced real estate in Singapore. Opportunities such as our unique buy-to-lease luxury hotel investment offer a low-entry investment option outside Singapore, in hot spots such as Thailand, that can provide the average income earner with a more flexible yet secure avenue for investment. As domestic market prices continue to slide, vehicles such as these may be the more prudent choice, giving investors less cause to second-guess their decisions.\n\nDavid Leong\n\nManaging Director\n\nPeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd\n\nTHE property market in Singapore is not thawing yet. The cooling measures have frozen buying sentiments for genuine long-term investors and for punters who buy to flip. The sub-sales volume and velocity have slowed to a grinding halt. The current curbs have slowed purchases, leaving developers to scramble to release their units with steeper discounts. Overall, the market has not shifted too much, falling by just a low single-digit percentage. Prices are hovering around a tolerable range and no sharp decline in prices is expected. Fundamentally, private property prices in Singapore will remain fairly stable as the stock of landed and non-landed properties is relatively small. With the current low interest rate regime and the large volume of money in the market, property prices would have over-shot if not for the cooling measures. Personally, I think the curbs should stay put for a while to let the steam off the private property market. When the curbs are slowly eased off, the government should control prices through its HDB pricing mechanism. HDB's prices will set the tone and direction of the private property market, and not the other way around. The tail should not wag the dog.\n\nSam Yap\n\nGroup Executive Chairman & Co-Founder\n\nHtwo Investment Holdings Pte Ltd\n\nSINCE September 2009, the government has implemented eight rounds of property cooling measures with the first seven having a reverse effect. The reason is - with each measure, it became harder for sellers to make a profit from their property. This resulted in sellers asking for higher prices for their property. The result was an opposite effect from what the cooling measures were meant to do.\n\nHowever, the last set of curbs seem to have really taken the wind out from the sails of the property market. The government has said that the new rules - particularly the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) - are ''structural in nature'', which indicates that they are here to stay for the long term. The tightened Loan To Value (LTV) framework is more market-dependent.\n\nIn my opinion, unless the latest round of curbs is relaxed, they could seriously affect capital gains.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Six MPs have filed questions on the issue for Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew.\n\nThe 298 people on board MH17 died on July 17, after the plane was believed to have been shot down over Ukraine by pro-Russian separatists. It was also reported that a Singapore Airlines plane was within 25 km of MH17 at the moment of the crash near the Russian border in Ukraine.\n\nNon-Constituency MP Yee Jenn Jong is curious about whether any Singapore-owned airlines have flights over conflict zones. The Workers' Party member will also ask whether the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore constantly reviews the routing of flights and advises on re-routing to avoid flying over trouble spots, even if such flights are permitted by international civil aviation authorities.\n\nNominated MP Nicholas Fang is keen to learn more about the regulations governing Singapore flag carriers on traversing airspace over war zones across the world. In all, 83 questions have been submitted for next week's sitting, 60 for oral answer and 23 for written replies.\n\nThe Auditor-General's latest report, which revealed numerous lapses in government procurement, has caught the eye of no fewer than five MPs.\n\nSeah Kian Peng (Marine Parade GRC) will ask Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam about the steps taken by the Civil Service and statutory boards to address the various lapses.\n\nThe Manpower Ministry, for instance, failed to detect the underpayment of Central Provident Fund contributions over a 10-year period to the employees of a company who performed National Service; the Health Ministry was singled out for continuing to pay S$64,000 in financial assistance to 99 people after their deaths.\n\nFoo Mee Har (West Coast GRC) plans to ask National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan whether the government would consider relaxing some property cooling measures such as those on the Additional Buyer Stamp Duty; she believes such a move would enable Singaporeans who meet the total debt obligation cap of 60 per cent to upgrade their properties while remaining financially prudent.\n\nJurong GRC MP David Ong is asking Trade and Industry Minister Lim Hng Kiang for an update on the national push for higher productivity, in light of the support given to businesses through the Productivity and Innovation Credit and the Innovation and Capability Voucher schemes.\n\nThe Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill will be introduced on Monday.

Rather, look inhouse to the CLA-Class. With the introduction of the latter and its ability to attract new buyers to the brand with the three-pointed star, there was no way to go but up for what used to be Mercedes-Benz's entry-level sedan. And the new C-Class has done that perfectly. More luxurious, more well-appointed and looking more like the new S-Class flagship, the fourth generation of the C-Class makes the car it replaces almost dowdy. Handsome in a non-aggressive way, it has harmonious proportions.\n\nThe front end represents Mercedes-Benz's current design identity, with a grille that is similar to the CLA's but less prominent and with more elegantly shaped headlamps.\n\nAlong the sculpted flanks, the signature dropping line extends smoothly over the lithe 4.7-metre body and 2,840 mm wheelbase.

By May Yip\n\nPublished Fri, Aug 1, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nMICHAEL Burke may head one of the world's largest luxury brands, but he is as obsessed over the intricacies of an It bag as he is about sustaining the growth of a multi-million dollar fashion empire. The Louis Vuitton CEO, who was in town for the launch of the brand's fifth high jewellery collection, should, after all, be a leading connoisseur of nonpareil craftsmanship. How else would he be able to justify escalating price tags for products from the fashion behemoth?\n\n\"If it were easy to answer that question, many people would be successful in luxury,\" said Mr Burke, when asked for his definition of luxury. \"The fact is, it is a very limited club, which means that there must be something more complex to it. But I would say there're a few necessary components: There is the artisan, and there is the artist. There's the creative side and then there's the making side. And basically it's a juncture of where art meets the artisan.\"\n\nPicking up the brand's status tote du jour - the Capucines, Mr Burke explains why the \"very, very high end bag\" has been perennially out of stock since its launch over a year ago.

You wouldn't criticise or attempt to reform something that was past its relevance.\"\n\nBut, Mr Yap added, the profession and its regulators need to ensure the quality of audit remains high because it holds a position of high trust.\n\n\"Audit remains the profession's most valuable asset. It is the platform on which the profession stands or falls. From audit, the profession gains unparalleled access and insight across all industries.\n\n\"And yet, paradoxically, audit is also the accounting sector's greatest risk and one that is most difficult to manage,\" he said.\n\nContributing to the quality of an audit, he noted, is the experience of the auditor. \"No system or process can substitute for the proper exercise of an individual's professional judgement and scepticism when assessing the accuracy of financial information.\n\n\"This is why we consider that, amongst the requirements to register as a public accountant, the experience component is perhaps the most crucial. It is the distinguishing factor between a qualified accountant, and one who is ready to discharge a higher calling as a public accountant upholding the public interest.\"\n\nFrom Feb 1, 2015, all public accountants will need to have accumulated 2,500 hours of experience in audit management, estimated to take about two years. In this, they must have independently and competently performed certain key audit functions involving planning and leading an audit, and forming and reporting on the audit's conclusions.\n\nAnd, to ensure that the audit management experience is gained at an appropriately senior level, the 2,500 hours will only count after an applicant has completed their professional accountancy training.\n\nFor ISCA members, the 2,500 hours will have to come after qualifying as a full ISCA member, which normally takes one to three years of post-qualification experience (ie such as after gaining an accountancy degree); non-ISCA members will need to have completed an equivalent amount of post-qualification experience.\n\nAnd, from 2019, the 2,500 hours will have to come after applicants have completed the Singapore Qualification Programme or a recognised equivalent professional qualification.\n\nMr Yap noted: \"At present, Acra generally requires applicants to have three years of audit experience, without specifying that the experience must relate to the management aspect of an audit. In practice, we find that most applicants too easily meet this threshold.\"\n\nTaken together, the new process of qualification would take at least five years.\n\nThe revised requirements were drawn up in consultation with the professional accountancy bodies and representatives from both large and small audit firms.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Cosco sent more than 20 ships to the scrapyard in the first half of the year.\n\nAs the supply of ships falls, there are signs that demand is picking up. After a weak start to the year, China's exports grew nearly twice as much as expected in July, driven by firmer demand from the United States and Europe.\n\nThe Baltic Dry Index, which tracks the price of moving goods such as coal and iron ore by sea, picked up to hit a four-month high in August after being on a mostly downward trend since the start of the year, suggesting that demand for shipping services is growing.\n\nAny rebound in China's real estate market may also benefit Cosco.\n\nHaitong Securities analyst Jiang Ming wrote in an Aug 19 note that recent moves by the Chinese government to relax property market controls could push the Baltic index up a further 50 per cent beyond the 1,500 level before the end of 2014, as it would drive up import demand for iron ore used in steel.\n\nOptimism could quickly fade, however. Factors such as rising fuel prices could derail the recovery, as well as continued volatility in freight rates, which saw the Baltic index sink to its lowest level since January 2013 in July.\n\n\"At the beginning of the year everyone had an optimistic outlook for dry bulk shipping,\" said UOB Kay Hian analyst Lawrence Li. \"But freight rates, particularly in the second quarter, have been substantially below expectations.

By Cheah Ui-Hoon\n\nPublished Fri, Aug 1, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSPENDING three hours at a hair spa sounds like an impossible luxury, especially if you're a busy professional. Working women with young families are even more strapped for time, one would expect. But it's these working professionals - with their harried lifestyles - who form the demographic most likely to show stress in their lacklustre locks, or worse, thinning hair.\n\nWhich means that a trichological treatment isn't so much a luxury but a necessity these days where modern day stress is showing in the scalp. More than a decade ago, when former SIA stewardess Anita Wong was flying regularly, and encountering problems with her hair, she realised how difficult it was to find a hair salon with staff who were knowledgeable about hair and scalp health. \"The first step to having beautiful hair is a healthy scalp, but in those days very few people knew about this,\" she highlights. She opened her first salon in 2006, and PHS now has three outlets, with possible joint ventures overseas.\n\nThis is certainly a sign that PHS is on to something. As Ms Wong explains it - and she's done her research - is that although the hair might be just made up of dead cells, they reflect one's overall health condition. And then there's the scalp. An unhealthy, imbalanced scalp will simply choke the strands of hair growing out. Which is why PHS's three-step programme is about detoxifying the scalp, then stabilising it followed by regrowing hair.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Contributing factors include higher interest income and a fair value gain on forward currency contracts. Earnings per share for the quarter were 0.64 Singapore cent per share, up from 0.54 Singapore cent.\n\nThe group's turnover from shipyard operations increased 29.3 per cent to S$1.1 billion from S$877.2 million mainly on higher revenue contributions from ship repair, ship building and marine engineering segments. It delivered three bulk carriers, one pipelay heavy lift vessel, one tender barge and one float-over launch barge during the second quarter.\n\nTurnover from dry bulk shipping and other businesses decreased 6.1 per cent from S$13.1 million last year to S$12.3 million as the current short-term rates were lower than the more favourable charter rates received last year. Cosco's shipyard business remained the biggest revenue contributor, forming 98.9 per cent of group turnover in the second quarter.\n\nFor the first six months of the year, net profit increased 24 per cent from S$21.8 million to S$26.9 million. Revenue increased 35 per cent to S$2.2 billion for the first half of the year from S$1.6 billion. Earnings per share for the six months were 1.2 Singapore cents, up from 0.97 Singapore cent.\n\nAs at June 30, the group's order book stood at US$8.1 billion with progressive deliveries up to 2016. As Cosco continues construction this year on new shipbuilding contracts that were secured in recent years at low contract values due to the slumping market, it expects operating margins on these projects to remain under great pressure notwithstanding improving gains in efficiency and productivity.\n\nDespite remaining cautious about the 2014 outlook, the company was clear about its future prospects and spelt out ways in which it would be stepping up. \"We are resolute in our commitment to deliver value through securing projects higher up the value chain as we intensify our efforts in improving capabilities and productivity,\" Captain Wu Zi Heng, vice-chairman and president of the company, said.\n\nCosco shares closed trading at 71 Singapore cents yesterday, down half a cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

You are getting good value.\"\n\nThis is why the group in late June established a S$300 million multi-currency medium-term note programme.\n\nGeo Energy said two weeks ago that it has completed the purchase of a 66 per cent stake in Borneo International Resources, which will swell its coal reserve bank from 11 million tonnes to more than 40 million tonnes.\n\nThe firm, through its Indonesian subsidiaries, indirectly holds a 236.1-hectare area containing coal with an average calorific value of 4,038 kcal/kg.\n\nThis mid-quality coal is highly versatile as it meets the requirements of power plants in India, China and Indonesia, Mr Zhou said.\n\nThe mine has a competitive advantage in the form of its proximity to a power plant owned by state electricity firm PLN which is just a \"quick\" barge ride away, he added.\n\n\"We have already rejected hundreds of concessions. What was being announced has been through rigorous legal and financial due diligence.\"\n\nGeo Energy also has a 4,570-ha coal mining concession, PT Bumi Enggang Khatulistiwa (BEK), in East Kalimantan which harbours coal with an average calorific value of 3,470 kcal/kg.\n\nThe Indonesian company, controlled by the Indonesian-Chinese Melati family, listed in Singapore in October 2012. The group, which counts \"Commodity King\" Jim Rogers as a non-executive director and shareholder with a 0.15 per cent stake, previously operated coal-mining sites owned by third parties.\n\nIt acquired its own mining concession from 2009, after a new Indonesian mining law kicked in and barred mine contractors from excavating and selling coal.\n\nThe fall in coal prices has not hit all Indonesian coal producers equally.\n\nIn a seemingly logic-defying phenomenon, Indonesian producers of better- quality coal - those with carbon value of between 5,500 and 6,000 kcal/kg - have come under greater pressure than mid-value producers; this is because of an abundant supply of good-quality coal from Australia and South Africa competing for a shrinking appetite, Mr Zhou said.\n\nOn the other hand, prices of coal with low calorific values have been supported by rising domestic demand for coal within Indonesia.\n\nStill, there has been some consolidation in the sector among the smaller players, said Mr Zhou. For Geo Energy, it has been about \"finding such assets that will be stars in good times and yet profitable in current moments\", he said.\n\n\"We have enough in our war chest to be able to take to the tables and put us on the beneficial side of negotiations.\"\n\nThe group hopes to widen its product mix to reduce its dependence on a single country or market. \"Our long-term vision is to have an enlarged reserve base so that we'll continue to deliver such values.\"\n\nFor the second quarter, Geo Energy slipped into a net loss of US$3.1 million from a net profit of US$5.2 million a year ago.\n\nIts revenue fell 44 per cent over the year to US$18 million due to weak demand for coal with low calorific value and the wilting of coal prices.\n\nGeo Energy's share price has fallen 58 per cent since its high of 63.5 Singapore cents in August last year, in line with the southward trajectory of coal prices.\n\nThe counter closed at 26.5 Singapore cents on Friday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Some 64.3 million shares changed hands, making the trust the fourth most traded on the exchange. AG Trust offered some 70 per cent of its 782 million IPO units to investors in Japan. The public offer of about 41 million units in Singapore was 0.7 time subscribed.\n\nThe company turned to Singapore as a listing destination as business trusts are not traded in Japan, said Yoshihiko Machida, the trust management's CEO. AG Trust's entrance into the SGX is seen as diversifying the exchange's business and real estate trust offerings. The 97 Singapore cents issue price translates to an annual distribution yield of up to 9.1 per cent for the forecast year 2015, and normalised distribution yield (excluding non-recurring items) of up to 7 per cent.

The dream dorm room was just not happening.\n\nFive years ago, Karen and Amanda Zuckerman hit the malls and big-box stores to decorate Amanda's freshman dorm at Washington University in St Louis. The offerings were . . . well, underwhelming.\n\n\"She wanted something special,\" Karen Zuckerman says. \"She wanted a home away from home that reflected her style.\"\n\nThe mother and daughter cobbled together a cute enough room, then did what any creative, enterprising family would do: they founded Dormify, an online dorm design business based in Rockville, Maryland.\n\nCollege students will spend US$48 billion this year (an average of US$916 per person) on furniture, electronics, bedding and other supplies, according to the National Retail Federation. Then there are the families who take it to the next level: hiring a professional decorator to transform the typical college cell into a cozy retreat.\n\n\"Designers are doing individual rooms and calling us for products,\" Ms Zuckerman says. \"It's becoming a really big deal.\"\n\nThe average dorm room - even at some of the most elite colleges and universities - is not only tiny, but also ugly: white paint, standard-issue furniture, fluorescent lighting and nothing that requires nails in the walls. (Some don't even have air conditioning, which creates another issue.) It's a challenge for many millennials who have never shared a bedroom or bath and aren't accustomed to roommates or going without.\n\nHelicopter parents are not inclined to drop their darlings at the dorm entrance with two suitcases and cheerfully wave goodbye. Instead, they're turning to their own interior designers or professional organisers, such as Rachel Strisik Rosenthal.\n\nOne of Ms Rosenthal's first jobs was putting together a dorm room for a female college sophomore at George Washington University. The student had a tendency to be unorganised and had a bumpy first year, so her parents hired the Bethesda, Maryland-based organiser to put together her dorm room in a way that helped her relax and study.\n\n\"They wanted her to feel comfortable,\" Ms Rosenthal says. \"I've never been contacted directly by a student; it's usually the parent.\"\n\nAfter taking measurements, she put the bed on risers to create storage room, revamped her closet, put in shelves and other wall storage, and reorganised her desk to keep track of assignments and other class materials. The total cost for labour and materials? About US$800.\n\nThe student was so pleased that she worked with the organiser four more times on other dorm rooms and then her first apartment. Dorms are now about 5 per cent of Ms Rosenthal's business, with clients paying the US$675 minimum for a combination of design and organisation systems. That's a relative bargain; she knows a professional organiser in New York who just moved a student into a dorm room - and the planning and design fees alone were US$5,000.\n\nThis is almost an entirely female phenomenon, fuelled by social media and increasingly sophisticated marketing to college students. Boys don't really care what their rooms look like - they just want the TV and other electronics. (Dormify added a section this year for guys, but \"that's really targeted towards moms\", Ms Zuckerman says.) Girls, on the other hand, create mood boards with pictures of their perfect space and trade ideas on Facebook and Pinterest.\n\nMs Zuckerman says more mothers and daughters are doing this together, often with professional help, to create the first dorm room - one way of easing the separation anxiety. The same baby boomers who slapped a Bob Marley poster on the dorm wall and called it a day are now willing to pay big bucks for coordinating duvets, pillows, curtains, rugs and other symbols of a well-appointed dorm for their children.\n\nDormify started out by designing fashionable twin XL sheets (the standard mattress size found only on campuses), then added other bedding and window collections, wall decals, storage and bath accessories. The company added a blog and \"style advisers\" across the country: 600 students who post photos of cute dorm rooms and other ideas for small spaces. It also has a licensing agreement with 22 national sororities, offering customised items and apparel.\n\nA typical purchase on the site is US$300, but some customers shell out as much as US$2,000 to decorate the entire room. The site also has a gift registry, and more students are asking for dorm decor as birthday and graduation presents. Ms Zuckerman says she probably spent US$1,000 on Amanda's freshman dorm, but she has heard of people who spent US$4,000 to US$5,000 on decor; one paid even more to install a customised closet system.\n\nMany parents are willing to shell out for dorm room decor with the understanding that they are, effectively, putting together a first apartment. The expectation is that many of the pricier items will last for years and can be easily transferred to a small rental.\n\nThat's one of the operating principles behind Zoom Interiors, an online design firm founded by GWU graduates Lizzie Grover, Beatrice Fischel and Madeline Fraser.\n\nThe three met as interior design students and launched an enterprise specialising in dorm rooms and small-space decorating. They had helped their friends put together stylish dorm rooms, and going pro was the next logical step.\n\n\"I just got finished with a mom doing a son's and daughter's rooms,\" Ms Fischel says.

Used home sales for July rose more than anticipated and weekly jobless claims declined. Most impressively, the initial readings from the Institute for Supply Management's survey of manufacturers hinted at the strongest expansion of activity since 2010.\n\nThis week, economists project more growth in July durable goods orders, new home sales and the June S&P Case-Shiller home price index.\n\nOne strategist says the topsy turvy, Lewis Carroll logic of \"good news is bad news\" may be gone from the stock market. For much of this year, investors were almost as spooked by surprisingly strong data as they were by surprisingly weak data. The fear was that the Fed's interest rate plans would be altered by reports of torrid growth that the central bank would slam the brakes to avoid economic overheating in the form of hyperinflation.\n\nNow, there's a sense of fait accompli about the central bank's plans. Investors have reconciled themselves to the benchmark borrowing rate increasing some time around the middle of 2015.\n\nLast week, when the Fed's minutes from the July meeting hit the tape, traders focused on the central bank's endorsement of the economy's strength rather than reports that members of the rate setting board were pushing for a rate increase.\n\n\"It was funny when the minutes came out,\" said Quincy Krosby, investment strategist at Prudential Financial. \"When they came out, good news was good news and bad news was bad news. It was clear the discussion at Fed was things are better and we're going to be moving on. It was almost as if the path to normalisation - which means raising rates - was set and market seemed to be alright with that.\"\n\nLast Friday, traders were similarly sanguine even as Fed Chair Janet Yellen made it clear that the central bank's next move would be a hike in a speech from the annual central banking conference at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. While Ms Yellen emphasised that she was still watching signals from the jobs market, she left no doubt that the question on the increase was not if but when.\n\nWhile absolute growth prospects for the US may not be stellar, the relative strength of the economy is another bullish factor. To a greater extent than its ally, Europe is feeling the pinch from the disintegration of diplomatic relations between the West and Russia. The fear in Europe is deflation \"economic paralysis\" rather than inflation, as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi admitted last week when he said that emphasis had to shift from austerity to stimulus.\n\nFor now, traders are likely to ignore sabre rattling and even skirmishes on the Ukrainian border. A declaration of war by the smaller nation on its powerful neighbour would change the calculus, however. That's why gold futures and Treasury prices ticked up at the end of last week.\n\nOne strategist said that investors should keep an eye on activity in those safe havens, even if the S&P 500 makes more records this week. Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade, warned that when bond investors and stock investors split ways as they did this week, the caution of the bond investors often proves well founded.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It was the second half of the 1960s and the jazz pianist and future music legend, still only in his 20s and a key member of the Miles Davis Quintet, was jaded, depressed and worn down by life on the road, playing night after night in clubs and concert halls.\n\nDuring a gig in Boston, as Hancock remembers it, he reached a low point in his career. \"I was getting fed up with my playing - I was stuck in a rut and didn't know how to get out,\" says Hancock, speaking over the telephone from Los Angeles in a recent interview. \"Miles noticed that I wasn't very happy and during someone else's solo he leaned over to me and - I thought he said, 'Don't play the butter notes.' \"\n\nOn stage and in the throes of a creative swoon, Hancock struggled to make sense of the advice. Davis (who died in 1991) had a notoriously raspy voice and was given to making oblique references, so Hancock decided that he shouldn't play the fat, or obvious, notes. He says, \"I interpreted that in a musical sense - like the third or seventh notes of a chord - so I carefully tried to eliminate the notes to see if it would free me up.\" Something clicked. \"People seemed to enjoy the result, and I got more applause than I was getting before.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Singapore believes this tax must be paid, while Malaysia has argued otherwise.\n\nThe matter was eventually referred to the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague, after Singapore and Malaysia reached an arbitration agreement in 2012.\n\nSingapore and Malaysia have agreed to accept the arbitration award as final and binding. They also agreed that the decision would not affect the implementation of the POA.\n\nAccording to The Malaysian Insider, which quoted an Aug 22 report by The Edge Review, the closed- door arbitration hearings in London wrapped up earlier this month.\n\nSources told the weekly regional magazine that former Singapore foreign minister George Yeo testified for the Republic, while Malaysia was represented by former second finance minister Nor Mohamed Yackop.\n\n\"As the decision of the tribunal has yet to be released, it would not be appropriate to comment further on the case,\" said the Singapore MFA spokesman.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Besson has created some memorable characters over the course of a 30-year career and along the way, has also proven to be particularly adept at action flicks with high body counts and wild car chases through the streets of Paris.\n\nBesson's distinct visual style is on view in his new movie Lucy, about a woman who inadvertently accesses the deepest parts of her brain and unleashes that newfound power to spectacular effect. It combines elements of Nikita (1990), Leon: The Professional (1994), and The Fifth Element (1997) with the frantic, bullet-riddled action of the Transporter series.\n\nScientists have theorised that human beings utilise only about 10 percent of their cerebral capacity. What would happen if, say, someone had the key to unlock the maximum brain power at their disposal? The film opens with party girl Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) outside a swanky hotel in Taipei, tricked by her boyfriend into delivering a briefcase to a hotel guest. Pretty soon, she's in the clutches of Jang (Choi Min-sik), a brutal (but well-dressed) Korean gangster who displays an impressive talent for killing people.\n\nThe case contains four packets of a powerful synthetic drug that Jang intends to smuggle into Europe. He turns Lucy and three fellow victims into reluctant drug mules by having a packet hidden in each of their abdomens. The plot thickens when Lucy is beaten up and the packet bursts and the drug is absorbed into her system. The effects are immediate and startling as Lucy transforms into a dispassionate (and very smart) killing machine.\n\n\"I feel everything - space, air, vibrations, gravity, the rotation of the earth, the blood in my veins,\" she tells Dr Samuel Norman (Morgan Freeman), the scientist whose research into brain capacity makes him the best person to understand what is happening to her.\n\nAs knowledge explodes in her brain and her existence becomes increasingly tenuous, Lucy knows she needs to ingest more of the drug to stabilise her system, so she contacts Paris cop Pierre Del Rio (Amr Waked) to help nab the other drug couriers. At the same time, Jang and his henchmen are on her trail, dead desperate to recover the goods.\n\nAlthough Besson is clearly having fun with the concept, the final third of Lucy is disappointingly messy and out-of-control, caught between the all-out action and high-minded theory. By the end, all that mumbo-jumbo about controlling time and so on has gotten in the way of the narrative.\n\nThere's no higher purpose than to pass knowledge on, says Dr Norman as the history of the world whizzes through Lucy's mind in a flash. Her evolution from space cadet to cerebral vessel is (mostly) fun to watch, and Johansson proves to be a worthy addition to Besson's list of kick-ass female warriors. Lucy is in one sense an ultra-cool mind trip but it's also just a variation on a much more basic theme: don't mess with the girl - 'cause she'll make you regret it in the end.\n\nRating:\n\nC+\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Yet it continues to be nothing spectacular,\" said James Liu, a global market strategist at JP Morgan Funds.\n\nFund managers, as a whole, are not taking a rosy view of the homebuilding segment. Actively managed US mutual funds, on average, devote just 1.06 per cent of their portfolio to companies such as Toll Brothers and KB Home, according to Lipper, a Thomson Reuters company. That was unchanged from the end of 2013.\n\nYet analysts and strategists say that there are attractive pockets of the housing market.\n\nPhil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors, built up positions in select retail stocks throughout the summer in expectation that a slowly improving housing market would help retailers such as Home Depot and apparel and home fashion company TJX Cos, parent of TJ Maxx and Homegoods.\n\nBoth companies should benefit not just from new home construction, which accounts for approximately 8 per cent of the housing market, but from rising home prices, which could spur homeowners to upgrade their appliances or otherwise put more money into their homes, he said.\n\n\"I'm very comfortable that when the dust settles we will see a resurgent consumer in the back-to-school season,\" he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Home Depot reported a higher-than-expected 6.4 per cent increase in same-store sales in the US and raised its full-year forecast. Shares of the company are up nearly 8 per cent for the year, or nearly one percentage point more than the broad S&P 500 index.\n\nTo be sure, some investors have already done very well betting on a 2014 multi-family housing market.\n\nExchange-traded funds focusing on residential real estate investment trusts, which typically hold apartment buildings and other multi-family developments, have been on a tear this year.The iShares Residential Real Estate Capped ETF is up 22.3 per cent year-to-date, while the Vanguard Reit ETF is up 17.6 per cent.\n\nThose gains raise the possibility that shares of the companies in the multi-family sector already reflect the boom in apartment buildings and have little room to run, analysts say.\n\n\"The data remains inconclusive and uneven, and that's the nature of the housing recovery right now,\" said Dan Veru, chief investment officer at Palisade Capital. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up", "images": []}

Jokowi won the election by a margin of eight million votes.\n\n\"The supplementary voter lists ensure the equality of each vote,\" CJ Zoelva said.\n\nThe Jakarta Composite Index rose 0.3 per cent yesterday to its highest close since May 22 last year. The gauge reversed an intraday decline as the Court read out the ruling. PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia gained 1.6 per cent, providing the biggest boost for the index.\n\nThe day was one of high drama but relatively little violence. Thousands of riot police repelled an attempt to storm the Court by Prabowo loyalists. Tens of thousands of police and soldiers took positions throughout the city's business district, government offices and high-ranking officials' residences, including those of Jokowi's party, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle.\n\nScenes of that heavy police presence appear to have had a lasting effect on voters who have become exasperated with Mr Prabowo's protracted election dispute. Opinion polls have indicated a jump in support for Jokowi, who will be inaugurated Indonesia's second directly elected president on Oct 20.\n\nFrom the outset of their deliberations on July 25, the justices appeared unconvinced by Mr Prabowo's claims that he lost the election because of \"massive\" and \"systemic\" fraud. They forced Mr Prabowo's lawyers to refile their suit, which sought re-voting in some of the country's most populated regions, because of factual errors and even garbled sentences.\n\nMr Prabowo's aim was to \"shake the system\", says long-time Indonesian analyst Kevin Evans.\n\nSome 16 years after riots forced president Suharto from office, Mr Prabowo, who was Suharto's former son-in-law, sought to ignite voter passions similar to disputes between political camps in Thailand. Instead, Indonesians have remained calm and their institutions worked, Mr Evans said.\n\n\"There are no red shirts and yellow shirts,\" said Mr Evans, referring to the short-hand reference for Thailand's opposing camps.\n\n\"There are only orange shirts here. People voted and got on with their lives. Indonesia has passed an important test today.\"\n\nWhat's more, the country's massive show of force left no doubt that the former three-star general has no allies left in the armed services. Outgoing President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has indicated that he is keen to preserve his legacy by overseeing the first peaceful transfer of power between democratically elected presidents.\n\nWhat's unclear, though, is the fate of Mr Prabowo's parliamentary coalition, which controls more than half of the seats in the House of Representatives. Senior members of Golkar, which placed second in the April 9 parliamentary elections, have indicated they are eager to play a part in the incoming administration.\n\nMr Prabowo's own campaign manager, Mahfud MD - a former Constitutional Court chief justice - resigned following the election, saying he failed to deliver Mr Prabowo a mandate.\n\nMr Prabowo, by some accounts, has been campaigning for a decade, only to see his dream of moving into the State Palace dashed by a relative political neophyte. As he hangs on, he risks eroding his credibility and the chances of reviving his fortunes in time for 2019.\n\n\"I don't want Jakarta to become (a state) of chaos,\" said Weny Sayekti, a business manager, who voted for Mr Prabowo. \"I regret voting for him.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It tells history.\"\n\nLike the slogan for the Rolex campaign, the intricate relationship between Rolex and golf goes as far back as 1967, when Rolex partnered with American professional golfer \"The King\" Arnold Palmer. Palmer was Rolex's first official golf ambassador.\n\nThere is a quote from an ad headlined \"Palmer and Rolex. Masters of Style\". The ad reads: \"There will never be another watch remotely like a Rolex. And Mr Palmer? We're certain he's equally secure.\"\n\nToday, Rolex is a leading supporter of golf, and has been the official timekeeper for \"The Open Championship\" for over thirty years. The watch manufacturer is also a major supporter of \"The Masters\", an annual invitations-only tournament held in Georgia.\n\nOther ambassadors of the watch brand include multiple-major winners such as Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, and rising stars Jason Day and Liang Wen Chong.\n\nLocally, Rolex supports the HSBC Women's Champions, an important event for Singapore's leading female golfers to compete against the champions of the game from around the world.\n\nBut why does Rolex associate its brand with golf? What does the company hope to achieve through this partnership? And why are other brands, too, consistently associating their brands with golf?\n\n\"It's not mass-market by any means, but if you are a high-end brand who wants to reach out to high net worth clients, golf is a natural sport to target. There really isn't anything else out there where you can engage with such clients, other than golf,\" says Tan Ju Kwang, editor of Golf Digest Singapore.\n\nHSBC has been a major international sponsor of golf for more than 10 years, and has hosted 30 tournaments to date.\n\nIn Singapore, HSBC supports the HSBC Women's Champions, which is also supported by Rolex, and the HSBC Youth Golf Challenge, in partnership with the Singapore Golf Association.\n\nThe latter programme aims to offer an opportunity for young golfers aged 12-17 to hone their competitive skills within a friendly and educational environment.\n\nGolf is an international game that is both modern yet rich in heritage, with principles of integrity and fair play, says Guy Harvey-Samuel, group general manager and chief executive officer of HSBC Singapore. \"It is an excellent brand-building platform for us because of the positive values associated with the sport - fair play, respect, courage and integrity - which resonate well with HSBC's own values.\"\n\nHe adds: \"Golf is one of the fastest-growing sports in Asia and resonates deeply with the people we do business with, as many of our Asian clients are passionate about the sport. It represents one of the best ways for HSBC to engage with our customers.\"\n\n\"Golf sponsorship, in particular, is a demonstration of our commitment to raise the standards of golf, both professionally at a competitive level, as well as at the grassroots level where we increase access and exposure to golf for young people. At the same time, it is a valuable opportunity to connect with our customers and colleagues in the local communities that we serve.\"\n\nBeyond golf tournaments, brands are seeking other ways to associate with golf. Brands such as Oakley and TaylorMade-Adidas have endorsed professional Singapore golfer Quincy Quek. Also sponsoring Quek are brands that are seemingly unrelated to golf, such as German automobile manufacturer Audi, and life insurance company Prudential.\n\nQuek, 27, turned professional in 2009 when he was 22. He has been sponsored by Audi Singapore since 2010, and by Prudential from July last year.\n\nWith Audi's sponsorship, Quek initially felt intimidated. \"They're such a big brand . . . why me?\"\n\nBut he says that Audi is about being progressive and constantly improving. \"Their idea is not to come in and pick up a guy who's already made. They believe in starting from the bottom and progressing upward . . . They said it's no use if you've already been made. 'We want to support you as you're becoming big - there's more meaning in that'.\"\n\nPrudential, on the other hand, is trying to promote golf among the youth. The company organises golf clinics for school children, golf days and charity fundraisers through golfing events.\n\n\"Over the past year, I have been teaching some of the junior golfers and trying to inspire them,\" Quek says. \"I think golf's a great sport. If you train, everyone can be good. Unlike a time-based sport like swimming or track & field, where the fastest, the fittest, and the strongest wins, for golf, the winners come in all shapes and sizes.\"\n\nOther brands are also riding on golf's coat-tails.\n\nIn 2013, Citibank released the first global credit card targeted at the affluent segment - the Citi Prestige Card. The card was first launched in Singapore and Malaysia, and subsequently in other markets such as the US, Hong Kong and South Korea.\n\nSaid a spokesman from Citibank Singapore: \"Singapore is among the top 10 fastest-growing population of millionaires in the world, as well as the market with the highest growth in millionaire households. We believe that this robust growth presents immense opportunities and makes Singapore an ideal first market in which to reach out to the ultra wealthy, offering them a card experience that is tailored to their unique financial, lifestyle and personal needs.\"\n\nOne of the key benefits for Singaporean cardholders is the privilege to tee-off for free at over 2,400 public and private golf courses in Mexico, US, Canada, Caribbean, Europe and Africa.\n\nLate last year, the bank also partnered with MasterCard to organise a special event for their Prestige customers to play with English professional golfer Nick Faldo in Singapore.\n\nBased on their customer research, Citibank found that access to premium golf courses is one of the top features that affluent customers look for in a premium card. The bank has seen \"a lot of interest from the affluent customers for the golf benefits\".\n\nThe whole image of golf is healthy and wholesome, says Mr Tan. But ultimately, \"the likelihood of company or brands who want to be associated with golf still hinges on the general popularity of the game, which somewhat relates to how many professional people follow golf\".\n\n\"Every company is watching their purse strings carefully . . . the more popular golf is, the more lively this area will be,\" he says.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/87df313e35f8b0586ce13b3dc3151491b4db1f8a60e824c021dba5aa955aa93a?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Just as secure: Rolex is a leading supporter of golf, and has been the official timekeeper for 'The Open Championship' for over thirty years; ambassadors of the watch brand include multiple-major winners such as Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, and rising stars Jason Day and Liang Wen Chong. - PHOTO: ROLEX"}, {"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/25f77bb34ddf443659959f2e4b07ad269042fd19df68a87203e9c0b586991677?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Faithful support: Today, Rolex is a leading supporter of golf, and has been the official timekeeper for 'The Open Championship' for over thirty years. - PHOTO: ROLEX"}]}

Yet, it was revealing in other ways. The speech seemed an admission that the all-powerful Fed does not yet know which way the labour market winds are blowing. This explains why the Fed has been reluctant to give markets a clearer idea to trade on.\n\nThe data is still mixed. Ms Yellen noted that it had been especially challenging to make an assessment on the extent of \"slack\", or spare capacity, in the labour market. Structural factors affecting the market, such as ageing and the hollowing out of mid-skilled jobs, are conflated with such cyclical factors as a business downturn that America is recovering from.\n\nA now-ditched guide the Fed used to guide markets on when it might raise interest rates is the unemployment rate. The US unemployment rate had fallen faster than expected even while the broader labour market remained depressed. This was because the labour force participation rate has declined to historically low levels. Some had simply given up looking for work. In her Jackson Hole speech, Ms Yellen mused that it is unclear how much the drop in the participation rate is because of cyclical, as opposed to structural, reasons. For example, people might have brought forward retirement plans due to the weak labour market. In the period ahead, retirements might contribute less to participation rate movements. The participation rate could very well increase in an economic recovery. Other complexities abound. In a nod to the inflation hawks, Ms Yellen said that labour market conditions might not be as weak as people think. Companies could have faced limits cutting wages during the recession and now, do not face the pressure to raise them as fast despite labour market tightening. Wage growth could also lag behind productivity increases. Nevertheless, in a boost to the doves, she also said that temporary wage pressures could also rise well before the labour market hits full capacity - hence it would be unwise to tighten prematurely. As usual, people tried to read between the lines of her deliberately vague speech. Some observers called it more hawkish than expected. Others said it was just another indication that the economic recovery will take longer to pan out. This time, the doves seem to have a stronger case. Ms Yellen's equivocation about economic indicators suggests the Fed will wait until things become crystal clear before announcing its first rate hike. This lends credence to bond manager Pimco's \"new neutral\" theory that interest rates will stay low for some time due to sluggish economic growth.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Fifteen years after leaving Iloilo in the Philippines for the bright lights of Manila, she and her friends have been lured back as her once-quiet hometown is transformed.\n\n\"Never in my wildest dreams did I expect there would be these developments mushrooming all over,\" Ms Palmares- Fong, 32, said as she prepared to take clients to view a site for new US$57,000 condominiums. \"It used to be a sleepy place; now, at night it's all lights.\"\n\nIloilo, the second-largest city on Panay Island, is at the centre of the country's biggest provincial transformation since independence in 1945 as President Benigno Aquino tries to reverse decades of migration to Manila and abroad.\n\nNew airports, roads and ports are drawing property developers, retailers and business-processing companies that fuelled a decade of growth in the capital, such as US call-centre operator StarTek Inc and hotel chain Marriott International Inc.\n\n\"The government has been working hard to develop secondary cities, recognising them as critical centres of economic growth,\" said Alexandra Vogl, an urban development specialist at the Asian Development Bank in Manila. \"Many are rapidly becoming tourist hubs and centres of trade, services and industry.\"\n\nFrom Jakarta to London, governments are trying to counter the draw of dominant capital cities that soak up the lion's share of workers and investment.\n\nIn the Philippines, that means spreading some of the wealth from Manila, an urban sprawl of about 22 million people that accounts for more than a third of the nation's economy.\n\nIloilo, an hour's flight south of Manila, is among those leading the charge. Downtown, it seems like any other provincial city in the nation - with jeepneys, motorbikes and pushcarts weaving through narrow streets of old churches, shops, peddlers and faded low-rise buildings.\n\nOn the edge of town, the contrast is stark. The old airport, replaced by a new one in 2007, is a construction site, where developer Megaworld Corp is building a 35 billion peso (S$1 billion) business park with a Marriott hotel and condos sporting names like One Madison Place and Lafayette Park Square.\n\nA mile down the road, the planned hospital, shops, hotel and homes of Ayala Land Inc's Atria Park District may create 10,000 jobs on former salt pans. For Ilonggos and Ilonggas, as the city's residents are known, the growth brings new opportunities.\n\nJulius Valderrama, 48, was unemployed for two years and couldn't afford to send his daughter Jonalyn to college. This year, the father of six got a job as a driver for a property company, while Jonalyn works at McDonald's Corp's fourth outlet in the city, giving them the chance to pay for her studies.\n\n\"Now she's even helping us,\" Mr Valderrama said in the restaurant, which opened in June, as 19-year-old Jonalyn serves burgers and fries to customers. \"Hopefully, she can be a working student, so she can get an education.\"\n\nAt an investment forum in Manila in March, Iloilo secured about 150 billion pesos of pledges for property, power, infrastructure and retail projects.\n\nMegaworld says that its Iloilo project will create 30,000 jobs in information technology and business outsourcing, with capacity for more than 3,000 at Colorado-based StarTek's site.\n\nMore than 900,000 people in the Philippines work in call centres and business processing, up from 383,000 in 2008, according to the Manila-based Business Process Association.\n\n\"It takes a lot of planning and vision to turn Iloilo into what it is today,\" Mayor Jed Patrick Mabilog said in an interview in his office. \"We built roads and bridges, and the big investments started to come in.\"\n\nThis year, Iloilo completed 14 kilometres of new roads and widened the 16km highway to the airport. A 3,700-person convention centre is being built for next year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) meetings to be held in the city.\n\n\"The benefits of economic growth are spilling outside Manila,\" said Michael Wan, a Singapore-based economist at Credit Suisse Group AG. \"The national government is doing the right thing: taking the first step by investing in infrastructure like roads and airports.\"\n\nIloilo's new airport, with non-stop flights to Hong Kong and Singapore, is among six provincial gateways that will be auctioned by the government this year as part of a US$20 billion Public-Private Partnership programme championed by Mr Aquino, whose single term as president ends in June 2016.\n\n\"These projects will make travel faster and more convenient, not just for Ilonggos and Ilonggas, but also for tourists visiting and businessmen investing in Iloilo,\" said Mr Aquino, 54, during a visit to the city in June.\n\nIloilo, built on a swampy floodplain crossed by four rivers, was the last colonial foothold of the Spanish in Asia, falling to revolutionaries on Christmas Day in 1898.\n\nTourists visit centuries-old buildings such as the baroque Miag-ao Church, or take a 15-minute boat ride to the white-sand beaches of Guimaras island.\n\nIn Smallville, the city's burgeoning nightlife centre, the upscale Amalfi Cucina Italiana restaurant serves manzo alla griglia con funghi, while diners at Bourbon Street tuck into grilled baby back ribs.\n\nIt's a long way from the town Ms Palmares-Fong yearned to escape from as a teenager. \"Iloilo was a small, quiet town. Everybody knew everybody,\" she said. \"I felt like I was in an aquarium. I wanted to be out in the ocean.\"\n\nWhen Manila-based Megaworld offered her the chance to become a sales director in Iloilo last year, it was her ticket home.\n\n\"I wanted to be able to say someday that I was part of this,\" she said. Two of her childhood friends also returned from Manila this year, one to work in a family-run hotel and the other in a call centre.\n\nIloilo's growth is also fed by a tide of migration from surrounding villages. The United Nations estimates that the Philippine population will grow 18 per cent in the decade through 2020 to 110.4 million.\n\nOther provincial cities in the archipelago of more than 7,000 islands are also benefiting, such as Cauayan in the north and Cagayan de Oro on the southern island of Mindanao. BDO Unibank Inc, the nation's largest lender by assets, has opened more than half of its new branches outside Manila since 2013.\n\nThe regional boom is helping the national economy, which grew an average of 7 per cent in the past two years. The World Bank forecasts a 6.4 per cent expansion this year, and 6.7 per cent next year.\n\nRising provincial incomes also combat poverty in a nation where the World Bank estimates 42 per cent of people live on less than US$2 a day. Minimum wages in provinces are as low as 205 pesos a day - less than half the 429 pesos in Manila, according to government data.\n\nIn Iloilo Business Park, plumber John Jadulos and his uncle are installing drains and pipes for the Richmonde Hotel. He's hoping to get a job as kitchen, maintenance or housekeeping staff once the building is completed next year.\n\n\"Iloilo's changing; it's brimming with job opportunities now,\" said Mr Jadulos, 27, taking a break from his nine-hour shift. \"Who knows? Next year I could be working in a hotel.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM", "images": []}

It has taken a fresh approach to revenue management, aided by International Air Transport Association consultants.\n\nAir Namibia's fleet of 10 aircraft includes two Airbus A330 wide-bodies and four single-aisle A319s, which it took delivery in the past two years, helping to cut fuel and maintenance costs by about 30 per cent, the CEO said.\n\nThe Windhoek-based airline had a loss of 600 million Namibian dollars (S$70 million) similar to that a year earlier, according to Mr Gsponer.

Prices for Seoul and the surrounding metropolitan area, where almost half of the country's 50 million people reside, have been stagnant since they peaked in 2008 after the previous decade of boom elevated household debt.\n\nEasing mortgage curbs to boost the property market is at the centre of Finance Minister Choi's policies to stimulate growth - dubbed \"Choinomics\" after Japan's \"Abenomics\", which refers to reflationary monetary and fiscal policies to revive economic expansion.\n\nThe BOK cut the benchmark interest rate for the first time in more than a year on Aug 14, to 2.25 per cent. The average new mortgage loan rate was 3.58 per cent in June, the lowest level since the BOK began tracking the rate in September 2001.\n\nThe economy expanded at the weakest pace in more than a year last quarter and the central bank last month reduced its growth forecast for this year to 3.8 per cent.\n\nThe nationwide apartment purchase price index was 101.9 in the week of Aug 18, the highest level since April 2008, according to the data from Kookmin Bank.\n\nPrices in Seoul's affluent Gangnam area - immortalised in Psy's hit song Gangnam Style - rose at the strongest pace in more than five months in the week to Aug 18, the data show.\n\nSome are sceptical of the measures' success.\n\nMr Choi's determination to \"normalise\" the housing market and boost sentiment may exacerbate South Korea's household debt without lifting home prices, said Lim Hyun Mook, head of real estate at Shinhan Bank, the third-largest lender by assets.\n\n\"Regardless of the mortgage rule changes, the fundamentals of the market haven't changed,\" Mr Lim said. \"People don't buy homes because they aren't certain about the future price gains and their income flow. It's not because they can't borrow enough money. I expect the impact would be short-lived just like the government's previous measures.\"\n\nA 10 per cent drop in home prices would more than double the interest-payment burden for those whose mortgages exceed 60 per cent of the home value, the Korea Development Institute said in a report published in June, based on 2012 data.\n\nThe household debt, including loans and goods purchased on credit, stood at a record 1,024.8 trillion won at the end of March, including 422 trillion won in mortgages extended by banks and other depository institutions, according to the latest data from the BOK.\n\n\"The loosened mortgage rules should be reversed,\" said Jun Sung In, an economics professor at Hongik University, adding that debt risk needs to be contained. \"Given that an interest rate cut followed the easing of the rules, loans on credit are likely to increase and add to the household debt risk.\"\n\nThe Financial Services Commission in February said that it aims to reduce the country's household debt-to-disposable-income ratio by five percentage points by 2017. South Korea's 163.8 per cent ratio is higher than that of the US, Canada and the average of member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the regulator said.\n\nThe finance minister's measures will boost the housing market in the short term, especially as interest rates fall, said Kim Kyung Soo, an economics professor at Seoul-based Sungkyunkwan University.\n\n\"Loosened loan controls mean more than just more transactions; it means more business,\" Prof Kim said. That comes at the expense of more household debt, he added.\n\nPrices for properties sold at auction are rising. The average auction price was about 87 per cent of what properties were valued at in July, the highest since at least 2008, according to Real Estate Taein, an online auction information provider. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM", "images": []}

But the fact remains that rescue measures have to come fast, the reason being that the group is in dire straits.\n\nIt recently posted a second-quarter net loss of US$53.7 million, 55 per cent worse than the US$34.6 million loss it incurred a year earlier. This marked the third straight quarter that the group was in the red, putting it on course for another loss-making financial year.

NOL has made losses in each of the last five full financial years (2009-2013), with the exception of 2010, earning cumulative losses of US$1.24 billion over this period.\n\nAdmittedly, the headwinds in the container shipping industry are still strong with weak trade volume and overcapacity keeping freight rates low. NOL has been working hard to alleviate the situation. The group has, for example, focused on cost efficiency to make gains at the operating level. It improved on its second-quarter core Ebit - defined by the group as earnings before interest, taxes and non-recurring items - by 52 per cent from last year, bringing its total savings for the first half of this year to nearly US$200 million, adding to the almost US$1 billion accrued in the preceding two years.\n\nThis strategy has worked for others in the container shipping business but NOL's continuing focus on cost management and operational efficiency may be insufficient to pull it out of the red. The group needs to turn its attention to its top-line too, which may be a challenge as long as freight rates plague its liner business. However, not everyone in the container shipping industry is suffering the same fate.\n\nThe Maersk Group this week announced a second-quarter profit of US$856 million, with its liner business leading the way with a US$439 million profit during this period, achieved through 4.4 per cent lower unit costs supported by higher bunker efficiency and a volume increase of 6.6 per cent. The difference between the two liner companies, and thus the impact on both bottom and top lines, is scale. NOL's liner shipping business APL is reportedly the world's seventh largest in terms of slot capacity, but even then that only gives it a 3.4 per cent share of the global market. By contrast, Maersk, the world's largest in slot capacity, has more than four times the market share at 14.9 per cent. For APL to bridge that gap and achieve a higher magnitude of economies of scale by cost efficiency, would cost the group more than US$5 billion just to double its current fleet capacity based on newbuild rates.\n\nAfter continued losses, NOL is edging dangerously close to falling into the Singapore Exchange watch-list and is only kept away by its market capitalisation. Now, more than ever, it needs to explore other means of keeping itself afloat.\n\nThe news that it is exploring to sell or list its more profitable logistics business, APL Logistics, is thus to be evaluated in this context. Diversifying its business may be essential for NOL to improve its overall group top-line. Even Maersk, which has a profitable liner business, spreads its risks and expands its revenue sources through other business lines in logistics, port terminals, drilling rigs and even a supermarket chain. Thus, if NOL does sell its logistics business it may be a little puzzling in this regard, as it would leave the group with its loss-making liner business and make profitability even more challenging. Sure, the profitable APL Logistics may attract considerable interest from potential buyers, but any gain from its sale will be one-off and leave the group to still ponder over how it can climb back into the black beyond that.\n\nListing APL Logistics may be a more strategic decision as it will allow NOL to tap the capital markets for a profitable business and raise more liquidity. In this scenario, NOL may consider it strategic to offload or consolidate its liner business in the long-run with the likes of the sixth largest container shipping line Hapag-Lloyd having previously shown interest. By getting rid of its Achilles heel, NOL could then focus on growing its logistics, or possibly other, business.\n\nShould NOL decide to sell APL Logistics, it could sell its liner business as well if winding down the group is seen as the best route forward. That is a scenario for its management and investors to ponder over.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It subsequently got a BBB+ rating at Standard & Poor's and a Baa1 grade at Moody's Investors Service, one step below the A- shadow rating that Danske Bank and SEB AB gave Maersk at the time.\n\nSince then, Maersk's 4.375 per cent note due November 2017 has returned bondholders about 4 per cent, including reinvested interest. The note's spread relative to the government yield curve has narrowed to 73 basis points at the end of last week compared with a high of 97 in March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe 2017 note's annualised return this year of 5.5 per cent compares with a 22 per cent surge in the share price.\n\nShareholders enjoyed an annualised return, including reinvested dividends, of 42 per cent this year.\n\nMaersk, which owns a container shipping line, an oil unit, a drilling division and a port operator, sold a stake in its supermarket unit in January, raising cash proceeds of about US$3.2 billion. It also sold 15 so-called Very Large Crude Carriers for US$980 million.\n\nBrian Boersting, a credit analyst at Danske, said in an Aug 19 note that there's still value in Maersk bonds under the current credit rating and repeated a buy recommendation.\n\n\"The share buyback, in our view, signals no further deleveraging in AP Moeller-Maersk, which limits the upside in bond valuation,\" Mr Boersting said. \"However, as metrics continue to be strong for the target rating of BBB+, we continue to see value in AP Moeller-Maersk's bonds.\"\n\nThe company's shares jumped 4.9 per cent on Aug 19, when it raised its full-year profit forecast, announced the share buyback and said it plans to increase dividend payments. Maersk's biggest shareholder with a 41.5 per cent stake is AP Moeller Holding, a fund controlled by the family that founded the company in 1904.\n\n\"The share buyback won't have a direct effect on the credit profile,\" Per Karlsson, a credit analyst with S&P in Stockholm, said in reply to questions. \"The company has made several asset sales, which has given it flexibility to keep the financial risk profile commensurate with the rating category.\"\n\nMarie Fischer-Sabatie, a Paris-based analyst at Moody's, said in an Aug 20 note that the rating company is also keeping its Maersk grade unchanged.\n\n\"While Moody's views share buybacks as credit negative, we positively note that Maersk's announcement follows a strong set of first-half 2014 results, which resulted in Maersk revising upwards its profit guidance for the full year 2014 and the receipt, earlier this year, of around US$4 billion of proceeds from disposals,\" she said.\n\nAccording to Mr Kirkeby at Nordea, that doesn't change the fact that bondholders now have fewer gains ahead of them.\n\n\"The credit profile has become a bit more stretched after the sale of the supermarket business,\" he said.\n\nHe has a market perform recommendation on the bonds. \"Maersk is now more cyclical after the sale. We expect Maersk will have its BBB+ rating for quite some time.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/a47e788820e539ab4f3eeb8c9c29fe67ae641e9cb4a716ea73673c3a4cc605a8?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Debt holders in AP Moeller-Maersk are looking on as the world's biggest shipping company uses its excess cash to enrich shareholders in a strategy shift that threatens to cap its bond gains - PHOTO: AFP"}]}

The bank said the problem was spotted by the independent monitor Mr Lawsky installed as part of a US$667 million accord the London-based firm reached with US authorities over claims it violated US sanctions laws in relation to Iran.\n\n\"It's a shade worse than was previously rumoured,\" said Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec in London with a buy rating on the stock.\n\n\"In the greater scheme of things, if it's US$100 million or US$300 million, or somewhere in between, it's not overly material.\"\n\nThe bank's shares are down 10 per cent this year, the second-worst performance among Britain's five biggest lenders after Barclays.\n\nMr Lawsky's office secured US$340 million in August 2012 in a deal reached the day before the bank was due to defend itself to the regulator. The rest went to authorities including the Federal Reserve, the Manhattan District Attorney and the US Department of Justice in a deal concluded in December of that year.\n\nEarlier this year, the monitor, Ellen Zimiles of Navigant Consulting, identified lapses in the bank's compliance related to a software program that was not flagging transactions from risky parts of the world for further review.\n\nMs Zimiles's contract is expected to be renewed for two years as part of the new settlement, the person said. Standard Chartered said in an Aug 6 statement that it anticipated the monitor's term to be extended as part of any deal.\n\nCaitlin Ferrell, a spokeswoman for Mr Lawsky's office, and Standard Chartered's Julie Gibson declined to comment.\n\nDetails about the settlement amount and the timing were reported by the Financial Times.\n\nIn the past few months, American regulators and prosecutors have forced some of the world's largest banks to pay massive fines for everything from breaching US sanctions to alleged mortgage abuse and illegal tax schemes.\n\nNow, the question is what the US is going to do with all the cash.

His decision is in line with American values and the principles of the United Nations. The disintegration of Iraq and the establishment of an Islamic state or Caliphate ruled by ISIS in the strategic part of the Middle East run contrary to core US interests and those of its regional and international partners.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By MIKE GRAY\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Aug 24, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nCONGRATULATIONS! You have been invited to join the board of a company that fits your profile and interests. However, on no account should you jump into a particular directorship without doing your own due diligence.\n\nRead up all available reports such as annual reports, press articles and filings with the stock exchange. And search the Internet - it's surprising what it can throw up.\n\nTake some time to visit the company to get a better idea of operations and meet other board members (in particular, outgoing directors) and senior management. By asking the right questions, you should be able to get some feeling of their competence and the culture of the company.\n\nAsk your friends and contacts whether they have any inside knowledge or know of any adverse issues concerning the company. Usually word-of-mouth checks with friends and contacts can reveal nuggets of information and adverse issues that may go unnoticed.\n\nSID's \"So, you want to be a director?\" course covers many of the risks and areas you should consider before taking on a directorship. I shall focus here on just two key areas of potential concern: company financials and board dynamics.\n\nCompany financials\n\nYou should always make it a point to look at the financial reports and examine the key financial ratios and trends. Be careful with loss-making companies and those with financial problems. In time, a loss-making company may find itself on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) watch list. Avoiding an eventual delisting can result in board members having to spend significant effort and time finding solutions to turn around the company.\n\nLook out for complicated financial structures and understand why they exist. The structures may be hiding losses or moving liabilities off the balance sheet. They could also reflect tax avoidance schemes which tax authorities frown upon.\n\nCompetent auditors can give a director some added comfort. Thus, examining the quality and adequacy of the audit is important.\n\nIf there is only one or no internal auditor for a significant-sized operation, this should set off alarm bells.\n\nSimilarly, you should ascertain if the external audit firm has the expertise to handle the audit.\n\nFor example, in the Bernie Madoff investment scandal, the external auditor of the multi- billion-dollar hedge fund was a two-person accounting firm.\n\nOn the flip side, when there are many different audit firms involved in a conglomerate, it could be that the group is trying to ring-fence issues and hide them from the parent company's auditor.\n\nA necessary step is to review the statutory audit reports and see if the accounts are qualified. If they are, you will have to make your own assessment on their severity and if it affects your decision to be a director. If possible, you should seek to view the more recent management letters from the external auditors and the latest internal audit reports.\n\nBoard dynamics\n\nTo be an effective member of a board, board culture and board dynamics are important.\n\nYou should meet up with the chairman and as many of the other board members as possible. You need to make sure that you can work with them.\n\nIt is useful to assess how dominant (if at all) the chairman or CEO is. A dominant chairman may stifle discussion at board meetings.\n\nA dominant CEO may push his or her ideas through the board without allowing time for directors to contribute their views. In all cases, there is the matter of loyalty to board decisions once reached, even if there is individual disagreement, and the risks associated with that.\n\nIn family-controlled companies, it can be a problem to challenge the family directors without being deemed a troublemaker. If you anticipate that this situation could arise, then you may not want to join such a board.\n\nAnother challenging feature to contend with is when the culture of the board or company is too gung ho. As a director, you need to decide whether this is a risk to you.\n\nAssess risks before deciding\n\nNo company is perfect. It will be up to you to assess the risks that may be latent in the board that you may be interested in.\n\nIn my view, it is generally better to be cautious. Having to deal with a problem company can be quite traumatic and your reputation as a director may suffer.\n\nEven if you avoid any legal problems, you could be left holding the baby as the last remaining Singapore resident director, after all the other directors have resigned.\n\nThe writer is a member of the publications committee of the Singapore Institute of Directors (SID)\n\nFor more articles, go to\n\nbtd.sg/BMatters\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Such has been the draw of this tiny Malaysian city with its laid-back charm and heritage appeal that it's spawned creative collaborations between the two cities, be it in visual arts or theatre. Now you can add dining into the mix, with three F&B players from Singapore headed up there during the Georgetown Festival to suss out the scene.\n\nFor established chef Anderson Ho, it's a homecoming of sorts, as the Penang-born chef was brought up in Kedah, before finally settling in Singapore in 1986. He will be making a trip back to Penang to cook for two sold-out private dinners at the private cooking studio, Burma 108, this weekend. The dinners seat 27 people each, and are an affiliate event of the Georgetown Festival.\n\nSays the 49-year-old: \"I have cooked around the world, but have not had the chance to go back to my hometown to cook for the public.\n\n\"To be able to share and showcase my cuisine to the public in Penang . . . it means a lot to me . . . It makes me feel proud to know I am contributing, in my own little way, to the dining experience in Penang,\" he says.\n\nChef Ho was trained by European chefs such as Alain Ducasse and Gerard Boyer while working at the Raffles Hotel in the past, and used to run his own (now closed) restaurant La Papillon. He is currently the executive chef of SATS Catering.\n\nHo reveals that his favourite hawker dish in Penang is char kway teow fried with duck eggs - which is banned in Singapore - as he was brought up eating it. He won't be cooking that at his dinner, however, as he believes it is impossible to make a version better than the real thing.\n\n\"It's already so good, so there's no point doing something different,\" says Chef Ho. \"Char kway teow should remain what it is. This is why for the dinner we decided not to do an interpretation of local street fare, like deconstructed char kway teow.\"\n\nInstead, he will stick to his usual style of cooking, offering dishes such as salad of mud crab with rice paper crisps from Vietnam, seasonal fish confit in green peas, green pea powder, snow peas, pea shoots and basil oil, and seared wagyu beef striploin with port wine jus and mushroom soil.\n\nAs for Malcolm Lee of Candlenut - a Peranakan restaurant at Duxton, he hopes that his trip will give him an avenue to get creative with his cooking as he hosts a sit-down dinner and two buffet-style supper clubs next weekend.\n\n\"Opportunities like these are where we can truly showcase (our creativity),\" says Chef Lee, 30. \"At the restaurant, we are sometimes a bit limited because customers are sticky with Peranakan food; so this is an opportunity for us to push the boundaries a little.\"\n\nHe adds: \"At the same time, this festival is a good chance to mingle with people. In a sense we (chefs) are also creative artists, so maybe when we talk to people there, we'll get inspired or get ideas, and just feed off one another's energy.\"\n\nWhile he insists on keeping mum about the dishes he will be cooking, Chef Lee reveals that his diners will definitely get to taste his signature buah keluak ice cream, plus his own spin on a few other Singaporean Peranakan dishes. And since this happens to be Chef Lee's first time visiting Penang, he expresses that he is most excited not only to try the street food everyone's been raving about, but also the Penang-style Peranakan food which is different from Singapore's.\n\nBut it's not all just about food, however, as Howard Lo, founder of Liberty Spirits Asia, will be hosting a pop-up bar over the next two weekends at a friend's new eatery along Jalan Muntri. According to him, this is an opportunity for him to get a better idea of the market and gauge interest levels before he decides whether to open something more permanent - possibly early next year.\n\n\"All the alcohol we're importing has never been to Malaysia before, and we think there's a growing interest and number of bars that are creating cocktails,\" says Mr Lo, 38.\n\n\"We've seen it explode in Singapore, and we think Malaysia is just a little further behind than that, so we want to be there when the boom starts.\"\n\nAnd when asked about the draw of Penang, Mr Lo offers: \"It's a very different feel from your cosmopolitan, super-modern Singapore. And as a weekend getaway, flights are dirt-cheap and only take one hour. With the great food and growing entertainment and F&B options, people have more than just the local food to look forward to now.\"\n\nrachloi@sph.com.sg\n\n@RachelLoiBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In addition, the bank's scrip dividend scheme for 2013 added almost S$500 million to the capital base.\n\n\"The debt issuances were very much part of business as usual process . . . there isn't any specific senior debt ascribed to Wing Hang itself,\" said Mr Tan in response to numerous questions on further capital calls.\n\nThe bank will continue to look at capital raising options, such as its scrip dividend scheme, he said.\n\nAnother area where the bank can raise capital is through divesting its non-core property assets, said OCBC chief executive Samuel Tsien.\n\nThese non-core property assets are mainly in Singapore and Malaysia with perhaps some from Wing Hang, said Mr Tsien, adding that the bank is not in a hurry and sales will only take place when \"we can achieve the right value\".\n\nMinority shareholders should be reassured that there will be no change to the bank's dividend policy of paying 40-50 per cent of core earnings, he said.\n\nOn the benefits from the acquisition, Mr Tsien said that as OCBC drives its Greater China strategy to deliver business growth, Wing Hang provides the group with a well-established platform to access customer deposit funding in two important international currencies - the US dollar and the yuan - as well as a new domestic currency, Hong Kong dollars.\n\nThe boost in funding access is critical to Singapore banks expanding in the region, especially as they try to capture the trade flows between China and Southeast Asia.\n\nTrade flow between Greater China and Southeast Asian countries in 2013 was more than US$600 billion while investment flow between China and South-east Asia in 2012 was about US$11 billion.\n\n\"Taken together with OCBC's already large domestic currency funding base in Singapore dollars, Malaysian ringgit and Indonesian rupiah, the enlarged funding base augurs well for its growth,\" Mr Tsien said.\n\nWing Hang, with its 95 branches in Hong Kong, Macao and China, will boost OCBC's Greater China network to 120. Wing Hang has 500,000 customers, including 80,000 business clients.\n\nMr Tsien also defended the bank's expansion into China at a time when the country is slowing down amid increasing worries over rising bad debts and shadow banking.\n\n\"The China loan portfolio we have is not representative of the Chinese economy,\" he said.\n\nOCBC's onshore-offshore business strategy of serving Chinese companies in their offshore expansion is working well, he said.\n\nOf the S$27 billion in Greater China loan exposure, S$3.6 billion was booked in China while S$7 billion was booked in Hong Kong, S$1 billion in Taiwan and S$15 billion overseas, mainly in Singapore, he noted.\n\nMr Tsien reiterated that the acquisition will be earnings accretive in three years' time and return on equity continues to be 11-12 per cent. The group has budgeted S$50 million for the integration, he said.\n\nOn Oct 1, OCBC's newly acquired subsidiary will be renamed OCBC Wing Hang at outlets in Hong Kong and Macao. The renaming of Wing Hang China will take place at a later stage.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They rely on a geography-based data program to quickly comb through large volumes of information - decades of sales records, demographic descriptions of nearby residents, and other data points - to predict how much a restaurant might take in annually at sites in the United States.\n\nOnce Mr Crouse researches a potential site, he submits it to an internal committee; if the location is approved, engineering and construction can proceed.\n\nWendy's is one of the latest companies to make use of software from an American company called Esri. Esri specialises in mapping various kinds of data - much of it culled from publicly available data sets - to help people visualise relationships, patterns and trends.\n\nEspecially since the economic downturn in 2008, many large corporations have been looking to such software - known as \"geographic information systems\" - to better direct their limited real estate budgets, according to Wayne Gearey at commercial real estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle.\n\n\"It's just starting to become industry standard for (corporate) real estate decisions,\" said Mr Gearey, who uses Esri and other mapping services, such as MapInfo's and Google's, for his clients.\n\nRetailers are especially concerned about moving to places with ample potential employees, he said. \"Once, in retail it was, 'Where is my customer'?\" Mr Gearey said. \"Now it's about business operations.\"\n\nMapping software has saved Wendy's about US$750,000 over the past two years that the company said it would have spent on various analytical and market research services. For instance, Esri's maps pull Census data to shade neighbourhoods based on their average income. This helps Wendy's determine where customers and employees are likely to be.\n\n\"We look where more income is, or less income, and where areas are more concentrated with family households, rather than empty nesters,\" Mr Crouse said, though he noted that this is just one element of the decision-making process.\n\nThe Wendy's human resources department is using mapping data to learn about wage requirements and available workers, he said. \"If you're in a more affluent area, it's going to be a little tougher to find\" employees, Mr Crouse said.\n\nIn any location, Wendy's also considers which other businesses could be co-tenants. For instance, he said: \"You're not going to expect the Wendy's to be sitting next to Macy's or Nordstrom, necessarily.\" Even after the location is built, it is beginning to use demographic data to adjust operations to the local customers, he said. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM", "images": []}

Manchester City, the reigning English Premier League champions, has an ongoing deal with Saigon Hanoi Commercial Joint Stock Bank as the club's official debit card partner in Vietnam.\n\nBarcelona, one of the giants of the sport in Spain, has an ongoing deal with Thailand's Chang Beer as its official beer in Asia, while German champions Bayern Munich counts Samsung and China's Yingli Solar among its many partners.\n\nEd Fitzpatrick, Repucom's executive vice-president (Asia), noted that while broadcast rights remain the biggest income stream for clubs in Europe, commercial activities are the second largest contributor, accounting for 29 per cent of all revenue.\n\n\"Identifying new ways to increase the value of these deals is incredibly important,\" said Mr Fitzpatrick, who is based in Singapore.\n\n\"The approach to segment and localise commercial assets is something we are seeing more and more of in football, as clubs look to generate additional income and make increasingly engaging partnerships, tailored to that specific market.\"\n\nHe added that, as their global profiles rise, clubs should understand the local market forces so they can forge the most suitable and valuable partnerships available to them.\n\nCommenting on the report, Jasper Donat, the chief executive of marketing consulting firm Branded, said football clubs should come up with creative ways to monetise their intellectual property rights.\n\n\"We saw the Italian champions, Juventus, play a friendly match in Singapore on Aug 16. Sure, it was great fun for the spectators, but what happens to the other 51 weeks of the year when the club isn't present here? And can they come to this part of the world every year?

It also warned that the scourge could persist for six months to a year. If adequate steps are not taken to contain the epidemic, there is a risk that it could spread outside the areas where it is currently raging. This is a risk too serious to leave to chance.\n\nEbola, which has already claimed more than 1,200 lives, is incurable and can be deadly within days of being contracted. There are some experimental drugs for it, but these have not been tested or proven, and in any event, are not available in significant quantities. The only \"treatment\" is to mitigate the symptoms, which include severe dehydration, internal bleeding and vomiting. Prevention and containment are, for now, the most effective courses of action.\n\nHealth experts on the frontlines of battling the disease say the international community is not doing enough. One of the most prominent non-governmental organisations involved - Medecins Sans Frontieres, or Doctors Without Borders - is fully stretched. Its director of operations, Bart Janssens, has called for a massive international public health response and said that lives are being lost because this has been too slow. Aid workers have pointed out that governments are more intent on protecting their own countries than on helping others deal with the crisis where it has already broken out.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

MAS will confirm the new date for disclosure of what investors expect to be a large loss with a notice on its website by today, the official from the corporate communications team said.\n\nMAS is set to be taken private by its majority shareholder, state investment fund Khazanah Nasional, as it readies a restructuring package, expected to be announced by the end of August. Khazanah owns over 69 per cent of MAS.\n\nThe second-quarter earnings will likely be the carrier's last set of results as a listed company. The results will reflect the lingering impact of the unexplained March 8 disappearance of Flight MH370, which weighed heavily when the carrier reported a hefty first-quarter loss.\n\nThe airline suffered a second disaster with the loss of Flight MH17, shot down over Ukraine on July 17. Sales slumped following each incident, scuppering earlier plans to return to profitability this year. The airline is instead expected to register its fourth consecutive year of losses this year.\n\nEarlier this month, Khazanah announced its plan to buy out the shares that it does not already own in Malaysia's flag carrier and delist the firm. The fund plans to overhaul the airline by cutting back on less profitable routes, trimming a bloated payroll and installing new management. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

Now the recovery in housing is fuelling a niche market for newly minted bonds that are backed by the most troubled mortgages of them all: those on homes on the verge of foreclosure.\n\nAnd it is not just vulture hedge funds swooping in to try to pluck the last remaining gold from the ashes of the housing crisis. The investors making money off these obscure bonds - none are rated by a major credit rating agency - include American mutual funds. And one of the biggest sellers of severely delinquent mortgages to investors is a US government housing agency. The demand for securitisations of nonperforming loans illustrates Wall Street's never-ending hunt for higher-yielding investment opportunities. The market also reflects in part an effort by regulators to close a chapter on the housing mess.\n\nFor mutual funds and other institutional investors, the appeal of these bonds is obvious. They have yields of about 4 per cent and pay out quickly - often in just two years - if the foreclosure process on the loans in the portfolio goes smoothly. The yields look enticing compared with the current 2.42 per cent yield on a 10-year Treasury note. So far this year, there have been 28 deals backed by US$7 billion worth of nonperforming loans sold to investors, according to Intex Solutions, a structured finance cash-flow modelling firm. Last year, Intex said, there were 72 deals backed by US$11.6 billion worth of nonperforming loans.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Wealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up", "images": []}

The jump in revenue was also thanks to progressive revenue recognition from the sales of another development, Eight Riversuites.\n\nUE said the consolidation of WBL Group's revenue for the entire quarter - as opposed to just a month of it, in the year-ago period - also contributed to UE's higher revenue.\n\nUE took over WBL (a technology, automotive and property conglomerate) at the end of May last year.\n\nUE also reported an 81 per cent jump in net profit for the quarter, to S$42.34 million, from S$23.35 million the year before. It said the increase was driven primarily by the profit contribution from Austville Residences. Its earnings per share for the June 2014 quarter was 6.4 Singapore cents, up from 3.9 cents.\n\nLooking ahead, UE said the property sector cooling measures implemented by the Singapore and Chinese governments will continue to affect property sales. So it remains cautious in bidding for new land sites in Singapore and China.\n\nAs for the automotive business, UE said it is cautiously optimistic for the longer term, in view of the policy changes in Singapore's automotive industry. It expects a sustained demand for its luxury and premium marques and said its automotive division will continue to focus on growing its businesses in Singapore and Asia-Pacific.\n\nIn terms of its engineering and construction businesses, UE said it expects construction demand in Singapore to remain relatively strong this year, and this should have a positive impact on these two divisions.\n\nHowever, in light of the tightened foreign labour policies here, it says it will continue to raise productivity through improving work processes and adopting new technologies.\n\nUnited Engineers shares closed one cent down at S$2.27 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With cross-border travel increasing the potential for transmission around the world, multinational organisations have a responsibility to be prepared for such events, and every good business continuity plan should have measures in place to deal with this kind of risk.\"\n\nOf the companies that did have measures in place, the two most common were the provision of a safe working environment (83 per cent) and a business continuity plan, which would kick in when people are no longer able to travel to work (78 per cent).\n\nWhile ECA International said that Singapore companies made up 12 per cent of all the firms polled, it declined to say how these companies fared.\n\nBut business continuity experts told BT it's unlikely that Singapore companies would have fallen in the \"unprepared\" group, given the country's past experiences with Sars and H1N1.\n\nSaid Nathaniel Forbes, founder of Forbes Calamity Prevention: \"Singapore has had three pandemics in the last decade - Sars, bird flu, swine flu - and I don't know many countries that have had deep personal experiences with even one pandemic in that time. So I think the government and the private sector here are actually better prepared than the rest of the world.\"\n\nTouw June Wah, Surbana International Consultants' vice-president for risk management, agreed: \"A lot of the standard operating procedures have been formalised since Sars hit us, so I don't think it's true that Singapore companies are not prepared. And you can be sure that firms with operations in Africa continually review and assess their risk exposure.\"\n\nStill, Business Continuity Management (BCM) Institute president Goh Moh Heng thinks much of this applies only to large multinationals with a dedicated risk assessment division - a luxury many small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) cannot afford.\n\n\"I'm not saying that we're not prepared, but I think there is a need to qualify here. It's definitely true that the big boys can hold up, but SMEs - which form at least 90 per cent of companies in Singapore - probably still have a lot of work to do when it comes to business continuity plans.\"\n\nAs to whether the Ebola outbreak could deal a severe blow to the Singapore economy, DBS economist Irvin Seah said any impact is likely to be \"muted and transient\" in nature, since Singapore has shown that it can respond to crises \"very rapidly and effectively\".\n\nSingapore had its first brush with a potential Ebola case yesterday, when a Nigerian woman was identified as a possible carrier of the virus - although this was later ruled out.\n\nLater in the day, the Ministry of Health, the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC), and Changi Airport Group held an emergency preparedness drill at Changi Airport to simulate the handling of an Ebola case. Observers say it is preparedness initiatives like these that bolster confidence in Singapore.\n\n\"Put it this way,\" said Mr Forbes. \"I'm an American, but I would rather be in Singapore in the middle of a pandemic, than in the US.

The sum is S$155,000 now.\n\nWhen that chance opens up, about 45 per cent say they would take a lump sum after leaving the required minimum balance in the CPF retirement account.\n\nOn average, pensioners who prefer a lump-sum withdrawal plan would deposit 30 per cent into a bank for funding retirement, use 18 per cent to buy stocks, bonds or mutual funds, set aside 11 per cent for travel and another 10 per cent for property purchases.\n\nThe rest of the money would be set aside for purposes such as passing on to their children, or buying an annuity.\n\nFurthermore, only a quarter of those polled say they make additional voluntary contributions to their CPF accounts. This extra savings come up to an average of 17 per cent of their monthly personal income. The vast majority who do not carve out additional savings say they do not have enough money to make more payments.\n\nOnly 32 per cent of those surveyed would actively manage their CPF. By Manulife's definition, active management refers to a reviewing and, if necessary, a re-balancing of their CPF portfolio at least once every six months.\n\nThose surveyed are not attracted to private pensions, with only 22 per cent choosing to buy an additional retirement or pension plan.\n\nNaveed Irshad, president and CEO of Manulife Singapore, said in a statement that people should consider developing a diversified portfolio that includes other financial plans to help with meeting their retirement needs.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

After all, with about 35 years of industry experience under his belt, Desmond Teo has grown almost simultaneously with Singapore's offshore and marine sector.\n\nBut the novelty in his management philosophy and the boldness in his corporate strategy suggest otherwise - his modern and fresh approach has propelled Gaylin Holdings (Gaylin) into an international player in the rigging and lifting solutions segment.\n\nWhat began as a small family-run trading establishment with just five employees in 1974 is now a listed company with more than 450 employees, with operations in nine countries and a market capitalisation close to S$250 million.\n\nMr Teo, the executive director and CEO of Gaylin, believes that this transformation is built on traditional business principles, which the company will not compromise on despite being less conservative in other areas of the business.\n\n\"Our strengths are our services as we ensure prompt delivery (of our products) to our customers, with our products being of good quality. We guarantee them (our customers) this and we promise on what we deliver as if we fail on either promise, the downtime to our clients, who are in the oil and gas industry, can be very costly,\" Mr Teo tells The Business Times.\n\nThat formula has worked to produce good results for the company. For its first financial quarter ended June 30, Gaylin announced a 30.4 per cent increase in revenue to S$25.8 million with its net profit surging 15.9 per cent to S$2.7 million.\n\nThe group, which offers rigging and lifting equipment such as heavy lift slings and related services such as load testing is, however, not stopping in its tracks and has rolled out new plans to expand its business. This year alone, Gaylin is expanding its operations in Malaysia with another facility, in addition to its test bed facility there, which has a testing capacity of 3,000 tonnes, and a joint venture business.\n\nMr Teo says that Gaylin may also look at new products and services and singled out the designing of offshore deepsea mooring systems as a possibility.\n\nThe group also recently completed the acquisition of 51 per cent of the equity interest in Rig Marine Holdings (Rig Marine) in the Middle East to give it a foothold into new markets.\n\n\"Baku (in Azerbaijan) and Kazakhstan are new areas where we have not stepped into before while Rig Marine has already been established in these markets for more than 10 years now and they have big projects there,\" Mr Teo reveals.\n\nHe adds that the acquisition also allows Gaylin access to the winch rental market, which Rig Marine operates in.\n\nAlthough Mr Teo says that while the group has no other acquisition targets on its radar at the moment, he will not rule out such a move when exploring new markets. Having already entered the Middle East market, he revealed that Gaylin may now look towards Europe, particularly Norway and Holland, to make a breakthrough.\n\nIt may not be surprising if Mr Teo were to pursue acquisitions to get into these markets as well. Where many local SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) may have chosen a more conservative route of gradual organic growth, Mr Teo has not shied away from mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to expand the group.\n\nGaylin's overseas expansion has taken off in the last two years, after its listing on the SGX. Since then, the group has invested more than S$20 million in its M&A spree across the region including acquiring Lv Yang (Tianjin) Offshore Equipment in 2013. With Tianjin being one of the key shipbuilding hubs in China, this purchase allows it to enter the world's biggest shipbuilding market.\n\nMr Teo's bold approach towards growing Gaylin can also be felt in his internal management of the company. In a tight labour market and where employers lament the lack of homegrown talent interested in the industry, Mr Teo believes in putting Gaylin's executives through the processes - from a junior and promoting them through the ranks - than to parachute in leaders from outside the company. \"This will allow them to learn from scratch rather than to get someone who does not know about the company's products and culture.\"\n\nHe explains how he even chooses to send the well-educated and qualified new hires through the ranks as it is both a chance for them to learn different aspects of the company and for them to prove themselves for leadership positions. Mr Teo's approach may seem novel and even risky to some but it is clearly not alien to him. After all, he himself started with the company from humble beginnings, joining in 1979 as a driver, delivering its products around town. This experience not only shaped Mr Teo as a resolute leader, having steered Gaylin through several sectoral and economic downturns, but also as a humble man.\n\nThese humble beginnings have shaped Mr Teo's beliefs in giving back to the community and shareholders. Shareholders should take note that Mr Teo firmly believes in Gaylin continuing with its practice of offering attractive dividend pay-outs, subject to its profitability and board approval. Investors, he believes, should be rewarded adequately for their faith and confidence in the company.\n\nThe philanthropist has also built up a strong corporate social responsibility (CSR) culture at Gaylin as he himself serves on the boards of several non-profit and grassroots organisations, including Ren Xi Hospital.\n\nMr Teo was recently among 14 Singaporean entrepreneurs honoured at the Asia Pacific Entrepreneurship Awards under the Most Promising category. With his bold yet grounded management style, both Gaylin and Mr Teo could yet achieve greater things.\n\nmsingh@sph.com.sg\n\n@MalminderjitBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

At 76, his annual premium is $2,649.42. As he can only withdraw up to $1,200 a year from his Medisave to pay for the premium, he has to pay the excess of $1,449.42 in cash.\n\nI had in 2011 advised Ms Tan to get the Aviva plan for her father under the \"moratorium\" underwriting option, which is guaranteed issuance regardless of the applicant's health status, provided that his life and/or health applications have not previously been rejected or deferred. Given his age and multiple health conditions including raised glucose in blood, high blood pressure and nerve compression on spine, Mr Tan would be deemed uninsurable had he gone for the full underwriting option. Aviva \"moratorium\" underwriting was his only option to get health insurance then.\n\nNot anymore. With the proposed implementation of MediShield Life which aims to cover everyone regardless of health status, pre-existing conditions would no longer be an issue come end-2015.\n\nSo, should Mr Tan (or you?) stop his IP now? Well, it depends if he wants B1 or even non-subsidised Class A facilities (so as not to put up with the long wait time for the heavily subsidised B2 and C wards, as it is now), and if so, whether he can afford the premiums. In addition, given his poor health and hence the broad exclusions imposed on his IP, whether MediShield Life would be good enough.\n\nFirst, as a national catastrophic medical scheme, MediShield or MediShield Life is intended to cover expenses at Class B2 and C wards in restructured hospitals. It will not be sufficient if you want to be treated in private hospitals or Class A/B1 wards as the payouts will be pro-rated to the equivalent Class B2 or C wards.\n\nIn addition, MediShield Life does not provide certain benefits such as the pre-hospitalisation and post-hospitalisation treatments, and certain outpatient expenses.\n\nThere's also no optional rider(s) to cover the deductible and co-insurance. Deductible is the amount per policy year you would need to pay for claims made before there is a payout, while co-insurance is the percentage share you need to pay in excess of the deductible.\n\nPrivate IPs, on the other hand, provide as-charged benefits and cash rider(s) to help minimise the out-of-pocket payments for expenses in higher wards. Private IPs policyholders who can afford it also enjoy shorter wait time and get to pick their own doctors.\n\nThe next consideration is the costs. As shown in the premium tables accompanying this article, the premium rates of IPs jump sharply when one crosses 60.\n\nWithout factoring in future adjustments for the increase in MediShield Life premiums, one can expect to pay over S$200,000 for the highest plans over his lifetime.\n\nIt should be pointed out if you pay the IPs' premiums using Medisave, you will be jointly insured under MediShield and in future MediShield Life which is run by the Central Provident Fund Board (CPF).\n\nFor example, a person aged 16 who signs up for NTUC Enhanced Incomeshield Preferred Plan will pay an annual premium of $192. Of this, $50 will go to the CPF Board for the MediShield coverage and $142 to NTUC Income for the IP portion. In the event of a claim, the two parties will split the costs.\n\nAlthough it is premature to assess the impact of MediShield Life in full, my take is that two groups of private IPs' policyholders are most likely to drop their IPs and downgrade to MediShield Life when the latter kicks in: Those who are currently being excluded from full coverage of IPs because of a pre-existing condition, and those in the older age groups whose IP premiums exceed the respective yearly Medisave withdrawal limits.\n\nWhile the younger and healthy cohorts will bear the brunt of MediShield Life premium hikes, given their lower IP premium rates, they are likely to continue to be insured with the private insurers to enjoy the enhanced coverage for higher ward classes during their active working years.\n\nThis may not be a desired outcome for MediSheild Life scheme, if more and more unhealthy and elderly IP policyholders choose to downgrade to the compulsory universal health insurance. You may recall that MediShield was in operational deficit for several years before the reform in July 2005, as its premium collections could not cover the payouts.

By May Yip\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Aug 15, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT'S difficult to meet the doe-eyed, effortlessly stylish Francesca Amfitheatrof without hating her, just a little. Not only is the 46-year-old the design director of arguably the world's best known jewellery brand, she is on track for adding sex appeal to a rarefied house - her minimalist first collection for Tiffany & Co is set to be a commercial hit, thanks to her ability to strike a fine balance between being on-trend and timeless.\n\nNamed Tiffany T, the collection is a riff on the stark lines of the letter - not unlike the initial \"H\" that has marked some iconic designs from Hermes. Taking the design inspiration further, the British-born Ms Amfitheatrof has translated the letter \"T\" into minimalist, sleek creations that could easily be assimilated into any woman's wardrobe.\n\n\"My criteria for the first collection was that it had to be about a new beginning,\" articulates the jeweller and trained silversmith. \"It has to feel kind of contemporary, modern, like things have changed. Choosing the letter T, it's quite obvious. It's always been there. It's a classic, but it's also new.\"\n\nDemonstrating how each link in a chain swivels in all directions without catching, how a statement cuff easily clicks on and off a wrist, or how to seamlessly stack rings to create a new look, it is evident that the collection is tailored for the contemporary dresser who craves easy, functional style. In other words, it's a collection made for women, by a woman.\n\n\"When I first started at Tiffany, I didn't realise I was the first design director to be a woman,\" says Ms Amfitheatrof.\n\n\"Women now buy their own jewellery. Unless we're talking diamonds and more expensive and more important pieces - we still are very happy if men bought them. But I think women now approach jewellery as accessories, in fashion terms. I think it's very important that I design also for me, I design for my friends, also I design for the people around me.\"\n\nBut as much as she seems the right fit for the New York company, the road leading to Tiffany was meandering, to say the least. Prior to joining the company last year, the Central Saint Martins and Royal College of Art graduate had designed jewellery collections for Chanel, Fendi and Alice Temperley; jewellery and accessories for Marni; jewellery and silverware for Asprey & Garrard; and a men's collection for Kauffman Stanley in Switzerland.\n\nApart from bling, her tabletop designs and gifts have been featured by Alessi Italy, and she has designed furniture and lighting for interior designer Muriel Brandolini. She has even developed fragrances for private clients and The Claridge's in London, and served as an art consultant and curator for major collections, museums and private individuals, including a group show in Seoul, Korea with works by Damien Hirst, Jeff Koons, Takashi Murakami and Cindy Sherman.\n\n\"I remember when I was at Central Saint Martins, in my last year, I had to go and see a career specialist,\" recalls the high fashion aficionado, who cites Haider Ackermann, Preen and Calvin Klein Collection as some of her go-to labels. \"And I remember saying, 'I want to do this, I want to do that, I want to do this and that,' and he said, 'that's too many things. You have to choose one thing in life.' I was like, 'okay, I want to work for Tiffany'. And the funny thing is, I have done all those things, and I work for Tiffany, so the career specialist was wrong.\"\n\nHaving worked for such a broad array of clients from an even wider range of industries has also provided Ms Amfitheatrof with the ability to oversee all aspects of the business, from creating the jewellery to curating store display and advertising visuals.\n\nIn future, she would also be helming the various categories such as men's jewellery, leathergoods or even fragrances. Her two decades in the design and art business has also led her to take a pragmatic view towards acceptance of her work.\n\n\"When it comes to working for a brand like Tiffany that everybody loves and everybody has an opinion about, I don't want to feel like I have to satisfy everyone,\" reveals the heels-wearing aesthete, who nevertheless reveals a weakness for Chanel's Spring/Summer 2014 sneakers. \"I prefer that people either love it or hate it, but at least they talk about it. You want to polarise a room, you don't want everybody to say it's fantastic because then the next day they're bored, they want to move on.\"\n\nIf this debut line serves as a gauge, it's likely that Tiffany fans are going to stick around for some time yet.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Going by central bank estimates in May, slightly more than half of real estate investments abroad went into Malaysia last year.\n\nInterest from overseas buyers for Senibong Cove, the 220-acre gated project with a marina and retail precinct, has grown significantly with Singaporeans accounting for over 70 per cent of total overseas buyers, Mr Walker observed. Overseas buyers make up 40 per cent of sales in phases two and three, up from 20 per cent in phase one. Mr Walker noted that buyers in phase one are seeing \"an 80 per cent uplift in value\" of their properties when compared to prices in phase three. Apartments in phase three are going for averages of between RM670 (S$265) per square foot to RM860 psf.\n\nAlso in the works is an adjoining 16-ha Senibong Hill, which Mr Walker is developing with the Wong family that is behind Singapore's fashion brand Charles & Keith. According to Mr Walker, both sides decided to work together after buying the adjacent plots. Their master plan for 2,000 units of landed homes and high-rise condos - with a gross development value of RM2 billion - will be unveiled in October.\n\nSeveral other overseas developers have set up shop here to tap continued demand from Singaporeans. Last month, Guangzhou's R&F Properties opened its sales gallery at East Coast Road to showcase the initial 3,200 units of Princess Cove's phase one in Iskandar.\n\nOver the weekend, R&F launched three out of the 15 blocks in phase one, with prices starting from slightly above RM1,100 psf for a studio and above RM900 psf for a dual-key three-bedder. The Hong Kong-listed developer acquired the 116 acres of land near the first link in Johor Bahru for RM4.5 billion in December and is said to be planning as many as 30,000 homes in total.\n\nR&F also held its first seminar here yesterday, where Ho Chin Soon, property analyst and map-maker for Iskandar Development, spoke on the potential of Iskandar in a ballroom packed with over 150 people at Village Hotel Katong.\n\nMeanwhile, despite concern over potential oversupply of homes in Iskandar, Mr Walker said that he was taking a long-term view. The Senibong project spans 8-10 years, during which one should expect peaks and troughs, he added. When completed, the US$1.3 billion project would have more than 8,500 villas and high-rise apartments.\n\nWhile there is bound to be competition, there are differences between the Australian and the Chinese models, Mr Walker continued. While the Chinese developers are building ahead of demand, Senibong Cove is \"building on natural demand\" as it needs to move at least 30 per cent of units in each phase before building.\n\n\"The Chinese are coming to Malaysia and other parts of the world with massive projects where the plot ratio is in the 6-10, whereas Senibong Cove is at 3.2,\" Mr Walker added. More than half of Senibong homes are low-rise landed units, while most Chinese projects tend to be fully high-rise condos.\n\nWalker Corp is well-remembered for breathing life back into heritage sites in Sydney. After listing the company, Mr Walker sold control to Australand in 1999 to focus on his private property portfolio but retained the rights to reuse the company name after five years. In 2003, Mr Walker re-established Walker Corp.\n\nMr Walker has A$12 billion (S$14 billion) worth of development in the pipeline in Australia, including some 25,000 residential units and 450-ha of industrial landbank. This is why he is sitting on the sidelines for further land-banking since \"it is hard to beat the Chinese with their cheque books\".\n\nThe group is also undertaking Australia's largest commercial development, Collins Square in Melbourne's CBD, in which the Kuok Group was its partner until 2-3 years ago. Walker Corp is now developing the project on its own.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Even though this is not confined solely to Singapore - according to data compiled by the World Federation of Exchanges, equity trading turnover in local currency in Australia was down 11.4 per cent year-on-year for the first half of 2014, 20 per cent in the Philippines and 13 per cent in Shanghai - it is worrying that in the Asia-Pacific region, the 33 per cent first half year-on-year fall recorded on Singapore Exchange (SGX) is surpassed only by the 40 per cent drop registered in politically troubled Thailand.\n\nPart of the \"blame\" for this rests with a reversal of the ultra-accommodative monetary policies that central banks have been pursuing over the past few years, while the recent spike in geopolitical risk caused by problems in Ukraine and the Middle East is also a factor.\n\nLocally, investor confidence has been dented following last October's penny-stock crash and this is manifesting itself in daily volume. Retail players, hit hard by that crash, have yet to return in force.\n\nTo some extent, a plan to reduce board lots from a minimum of 1,000 shares to 100 from next year should help as it will make high-priced stocks more accessible to smaller investors. A lot more however, needs to be done in order to lift daily volume to meaningful levels. One way to attract greater investor interest is to offer better quality, possibly large-cap international listings.\n\nThere has been a spate of new flotations recently but only a small number could realistically qualify as being of investment grade - quality on the whole has been patchy, with some being small-cap firms that have little or no earnings.\n\nAlthough firms which may be unprofitable but show promise or operate in up-and-coming sectors should remain valid listing targets, it is equally vital to ensure investors are regularly presented with established, money-making names in which to invest. Having such companies on the menu will also attract greater institutional presence and the liquidity that these players command and, as most observers know, liquidity begets liquidity.\n\nAnother way to boost volume is through the introduction of market makers for stocks. Earlier this year, it was reported that SGX was considering this and was looking at lowering its clearing fees as enticement. This is a step in the right direction but will need to be carefully implemented with appropriate safeguards to ensure that high-speed traders do not get an unfair advantage.\n\nOther measures which might be considered include expanding the suite of derivative hedging tools available to traders, such as single-stock options and futures, ensuring all investors have equal access to the latest research on as many firms as possible and imposing swift regulatory action when rules are broken so as to ensure that confidence in the system remains high.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

She initiated the idea of the charity sale and has guided its progress every step of the way.\" Born Free is a private sector-led initiative to end mother-to-child HIV transmission.\n\nIn February this year, following an invitation from American Vogue editor Anna Wintour to visit South Africa, Mrs Beckham was so moved by the experience that she began to plan an initiative to raise money and awareness. With help from her mother and sister, she selected iconic pieces from her wardrobe - pieces from her early days with the Spice Girls, that she wore out with David Beckham, and from catwalk appearances, parties, awards shows and other events that have been heavily documented and photographed by the world's press.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A 2012 study commissioned by the Life Insurance Association estimated that 58 per cent of the Singapore population own at least one insurance policy. Among those age 30 to 49, the penetration rate is even higher at 73 per cent. Yet, it is an industry where misconceptions and confusion about insurance persist, even as a segment of the population grows more financially sophisticated. It is also an industry where advice may be skewed by product commissions, which have remained stubbornly impervious to competition. Hence the type of products most frequently bought by individuals is telling: whole life policies and endowments, which pay higher commissions, are far more popular than term assurance. For the same premium, term assurance provides significantly more protection than whole life policies.\n\nEnter the new direct sales channel mandated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore from next year. Consumers are expected to be able to access a portal which aggregates insurers' offerings in the whole life and term life space. For the first time, they will be able to compare prices and benefits, buy directly from insurers and pay no commissions. Already in the market today, one financial advisory firm - Providend - has launched its own do-it-yourself insurance portal, which carries term assurance and more recently, endowment plans, from selected insurers. It is hoped that the direct channel will help to lower product costs, which should enhance cash values of whole life plans. Ultimately, it is also hoped that the channel would help plug the protection gap, which was estimated in 2012 at a total of S$462 billion or over S$242,000 per working adult.\n\nTo be sure, the direct channel ushers in a number of significant benefits. One is greater price transparency and the ability to compare prices. Insurers have often hid behind the argument that product benefits differ too much to be comparable. But that is clearly not so, particularly in plain vanilla products such as term assurance and even whole life plans. A second potential benefit is a greater degree of competitiveness in terms of price and benefits. Insurers who aim to stand out will surely enhance their offerings.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished Fri, Aug 15, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nDEPENDING on your world view, the Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class compact sport-utility vehicle can either be an entry-level SUV or a high-end hatchback. The GLA-Class is based on the same platform as the A-Class hatchback but with a high-riding body that is slightly longer (due to an extended rear end), wider and, of course, taller. But the 2,699 mm wheelbase is identical, which means that although rear legroom is unchanged in the GLA-Class cabin, the headroom - both in front and behind - is improved.\n\nMore significantly, the hip point, which refers to the height of the seat squab, is also slightly higher. This means getting in and out of the GLA-Class is a bit easier, especially if you're no longer a spring chicken.\n\nWith more buff styling than the A-Class, the GLA-Class also looks more imposing. It doesn't look substantially taller - just bigger and more macho.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Instead of merely tucking into her favourite local food, she has gone on to create a range of food-related characters.\n\nMeet Ang Ku Kueh Girl, Png Kueh Girl and Kueh Lapis Girl. \"I'm more of a savoury food kind of girl, so I especially love png kueh and curry puff. As for sweet stuff, I enjoy my ang ku kueh and kueh lapis once in a while,\" says Ms Wang, 38. \"It is no coincidence that Ang Ku Kueh Girl, Png Kueh Girl and Kueh Lapis Girl are best friends.\"\n\nBut why food? Ms Wang says: \"Food is something which is close to our hearts, and it is something that most Singaporeans can identify with. There are also interesting aspects of each kind of food that reflect our culture, for example, ang ku kueh is red and shaped like a tortoise, signifying good luck and longevity.\"\n\nBesides the three girls, other characters that Ms Wang has created include Ang Ku Kueh Boy, Curry Puff Boy, Roti Prata Boy and Gem Babies.\n\n\"I start by looking at food which have a deeper cultural meaning, interesting colours or shapes. For example, ang ku kueh and png kueh represents longevity. Their shapes are interesting too, tortoise shell and peach respectively. Both these shapes represent longevity. Contrary to popular perception, the png kueh is peach shaped, not a triangle.\"\n\nIt takes her about two weeks to six months to create a character. \"I'm usually looking for that elusive 'love at first glance' feeling when developing a character.\"\n\nThe signature character Ang Ku Kueh Girl wears a red hood shaped like an ang ku kueh, while her green dress is reminiscent of the banana leaf that an ang ku kueh is placed on. Ms Wang also creates a story behind each character. For example, Ang Ku Kueh Girl loves to play games, and is quite kiasu and likes to win. \"She enjoys wearing slippers like most Singaporeans too,\" quips Ms Wang.\n\nAng Ku Kueh Girl and her friends can be found on a variety of merchandise, from tote bags, to notebooks, and accessories. A brooch set costs S$12, and a tote bag retails for S$25.90. The items are sold online as well as at the National Museum shop and other stores that promote local design.\n\nMs Wang says that the tote bags are very popular, as well as the Thankful Journal, which encourages users to write down things that they are thankful for. \"Handwritten notes are getting rare nowadays due to the proliferation of portable digital devices,\" she says. \"With the journals, I try to promote back-to-basic manual writing to keep it alive.\"\n\nAng Ku Kueh Girl and her friends have found fans in both locals and tourists. Some companies have also snapped them up as corporate gifts. \"I've some customers from Indonesia and the Philippines, and the furthest I have shipped to is to France,\" she says.\n\nMs Wang, who works with a team of part-timers, is currently working on a Chinese version of the website, so that she can reach more overseas customers. \"I would like the characters to go global one day, and to be able to create new friends, for example like Sushi Girl or Monsieur Croissant.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But behind the headline numbers, its transformation into a group with a substantial investment property portfolio providing recurring-income ballast is starting to show in its latest report card.\n\nRental from the group's industrial and commercial properties jumped to S$25.7 million in Q2 ended June 30, from S$2.8 million in Q2 2013 - mainly from rentals of office buildings ie, The Metropolis in Buona Vista, Singapore and Rose Court and 1 St Martin's Le Grand, both in London.\n\nHo Bee completed developing The Metropolis last year. It also bought Rose Court last year, followed by 1 St Martin's Le Grand this year. Ho Bee's Q2 results do not include rental income from about 70,000 sq ft at The Metropolis leased to GE as the MNC took over the space only in Q3 this year. Currently about 95 per cent of The Metropolis' 1.08 million sq ft net lettable area has been leased. When fully let, rental income from the asset is expected to stablise at about S$80 million gross a year; analysts estimate the net rental income at about S$50 milion.\n\nThe two London office buildings are fully leased, generating around \u00a314 million (S$29 million) net rental income annually. The group's chairman and CEO Chua Thian Poh said: \"With the completion of The Metropolis and the strategic acquisitions of Rose Court and 1 St Martin's Le Grand in London, the group now has a substantial stream of investment income that would underpin earnings in the years to come.\"\n\nOn the continued challenging environment for the Singapore residential property market, he added: \"The Government had reiterated on many occasions that it is still too early to relax the cooling measures.\"\n\nIn Sentosa Cove, the group is leasing out its unsold, completed condo units as an interim strategy until the high-end residential market recovers.\n\nOverseas, Ho Bee has four development projects in Australia (three on the Gold Coast, one in Melbourne) as well as three developments in China (in Shanghai, Tangshan and Zhuhai). Revenue and earnings from sales of units in these projects will be recognised only upon completion of the developments.\n\nOn the drop in its Q2 net earnings, Ho Bee said this was due to a S$25.9 million gain on disposal of Hotel Windsor in MacPherson in the year-ago period.\n\nGroup turnover surged to S$26.81 million in Q2 2014 from S$6.09 million in Q2 2013, on the back of higher revenue from investment properties. Cash and cash equivalents shrank to S$19.1 million as at June 30, 2014 from S$117.56 million as at Dec 31, 2013.\n\nEarnings per share halved to 1.83 Singapore cents from 3.88 cents previously. Net asset value per share stood at S$3.40 at end-June 2014, down from S$3.48 at Dec 31, 2013. The counter ended 1 Singapore cent higher at S$2.20 yesterday. Ho Bee announced its results after the stock market closed.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Singapore Icons won Design of the Year at last year's President's Design Award.\n\nMr Low wants to recreate that success again, with Aspects, a collection of five drinking glasses, handcrafted and delicately etched with an imprint of five designers' takes on different aspects of our society. \"You can use each glass as a functional object or look beyond to behold its value and its meaningful representation of our complex world,\" he says.\n\nAs with Singapore Icons, Mr Low picked five designers to create the collection. For Aspects, he picked Kelley Cheng, founder of publishing firm The Press Room; Antoinette Wong and Stanley Tan of The Little Drom Store; industrial designers Hunn Wai and Francesca Lanzavecchia of Lanzavecchia + Wai; design firm Hjgher; as well as the design team from Supermama.\n\nEach design team was given a theme - arts, youth, education, sports and garden. Mr Low left it to the designers to interpret each theme. \"The theme for this series is wider and I hope to position it not just for the local market, but it would be fantastic if I can break into the international market with this collection,\" says Mr Low. \"So the designers I chose had to be doing design and have another area of interest. Plus the design agencies themselves had to have a wide international audience in place.\"\n\nLanzavecchia + Wai was given the education theme. Their glass, titled Altruistic Alphabet has the alphabet etched on them. But instead of the usual A for apple, B for boy, the glass says A for Altruism, B for Bravery and so on.\n\n\"Francesca and I did the design for the glass with the intention to hijack the 'everyday-ness' of a drinking glass, and the archetypal educational graphical format of alphabet charts and periodic tables,\" says Mr Wai. \"We wanted to introduce the glass user, regardless of who they are, to good human values.\"\n\nThe Supermama inhouse design team handled the Garden theme. The glass, called Gardens, has Singapore's iconic trees, the Yellow Flame Tree, the Tembusu Tree, the Rain Tree and the Broad-leafed Mahogany, etched on it.\n\nThe glasses are all individually handcrafted and mouthblown by skilled craftsmen, from famed Japanese glass company Shotoku.\n\nJust for National Day, pick up any two Aspects glasses for S$49.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These borrowers were buyers of high-end investment properties.\n\nOf OCBC's overall property loan book, 24 per cent is made up of loans meant for property investment, though Ching Wei Hong, chief operating officer of OCBC, stressed the NPL ratio for this loan segment is at about the level for the owner-occupied segment.\n\nThe bank is comfortable with its China portfolio.\n\nIt focuses on trade finance deals linked to the movement of goods, as opposed to the storage of goods, said Mr Tsien.\n\nA key implication then, is that trade financing linked to the storage of goods is typically collateralised using commodities. The heightened attention comes on the back of fake commodity financing at Qingdao, the world's seventh-largest container port.\n\nThe fraud involved multiple creditors holding claims on the same collateral via duplicated receipts.\n\nOf OCBC's total China-linked loan book of S$27 billion, most of it remains booked in Singapore. OCBC categorises loans according to where the credit risk resides.\n\nThe bank's China-linked loan book has contracted slightly over the quarter, as the gap between onshore and offshore rates was significantly reduced. Chinese corporates borrow from banks such as OCBC to take advantage of cheaper offshore rates, but that incentive is now less attractive.\n\n\"The compression of the gap between the onshore and offshore (rate) will continue,\" said Mr Tsien, adding that this will probably drop to under the current gap of one per cent.\n\nFull-year net interest margin (NIM) should be stronger than last year's 1.64 per cent, but a touch below the first half's 1.7 per cent, he said.\n\nSpeaking broadly on capital-raising plans to fund the full acquisition of Wing Hang Bank, Mr Tsien said OCBC will hold enough capital that is \"comfortably above\" regulatory requirements, and that is comparable to its peers.\n\nTo maintain a core Tier-1 capital ratio (CET1) of 10 per cent of the bank's risk-weighted assets, OCBC would need to raise more than S$4 billion, analysts have estimated. In the second quarter, the bank's CET1 was 14.7 per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However, market observers told BT that it is premature to say if trading volumes for July is a blip, or a sign of recovery.\n\nLoh Hoon Sun, managing director, Phillip Securities, said: \"Investors are now seeing better prospects for the market and hopefully it will continue. It (the July figure) doesn't indicate much. Hopefully it's a good sign as the Singapore market has been lagging behind compared with other economies such as the US.\"\n\nDavid Gerald, president and CEO of Securities Investors Association Singapore (SIAS), commented: \"It is too early to say. It is encouraging, but not good enough.\"\n\nThe latest figures come several days after the Monetary Association of Singapore (MAS) and SGX unveiled measures aimed at restoring investor confidence to prevent a repeat of the penny stocks saga which has cast a shadow on the market.\n\nSome measures that the regulators will impose starting next year include a minimum trading price of S$0.20 for mainboard shares and a reduction of lot size from 1,000 to 100 shares.\n\nMr Loh expects that there will be an adverse reaction initially to a 5 per cent collateral requirement for contra trades that may result in lower trading volume.\n\nHowever, he says the market should soon \"adjust itself and get used to this new trading rule\".\n\nMr Loh added that the new regulatory measures will help strengthen the Singapore market and bring in more investors, driving up trading volumes when the new rules kick in.\n\nHowever, Jimmy Ho, a remisier at UOB Kay Hian, says that the new measures could potentially dampen trading volume instead.\n\n\"Investors will be reluctant to pay 5 per cent collateral, and stocks trading could be affected. A minimum trading price of 20 cents is also too much and may impact the market negatively,\" he noted.\n\nBoth Mr Ho and Mr Loh think that the reduction of lot size of listed securities to 100 will not have much of an impact on trading volume, even though the move is targeted at attracting retail investors to participate more in the stock market.\n\nMr Gerald says that, in time to come, the new regulatory changes will encourage retail investors to participate, if coupled with greater investor education and information.\n\n\"There is a need to build up investor confidence in order to drive up trading volume. One way to do that is for SGX and MAS to bring back the independent stocks reports that they used to have,\" he said.\n\nThe volume of derivatives also went up slightly compared with June. Total derivatives volume was unchanged at 8.9 million contracts in July from a year earlier and up 3 per cent month-on-month.\n\nTotal commodities (OTC and futures) volume totalled 211,537 contracts, double that of a year earlier.\n\nTotal volume of iron ore derivatives which included futures, options and cleared swaps stood at 157,673 contracts, three times the volume a year earlier, while SGX rubber futures saw a total of 38,780 contracts traded, a 20 per cent increase year-on-year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Against the land price of Rivertrees Residences - the highest bids for Parcels A and B on Fernvale Road are lower by 17.8 per cent and 15.9 per cent respectively.\n\nA tie-up involving Chip Eng Seng, Kim Seng Heng Realty and Heeton Homes placed the highest bids for both parcels in the latest tender. Analysts attribute the slightly higher bid for Parcel B to it being closer to Thanggam LRT Station. \"These bid levels are around my expectation of $450 psf ppr for the two plots taking into account weaker market conditions today,\" said Mr Ong. The introduction of the TDSR (total debt servicing ratio) framework in late-June 2013 has reduced property transactions.\n\nAnalysts polled by BT when the sites were launched by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) in June this year had forecast top bids of $420-480 psf ppr for the two sites, with around five bids for each plot.\n\n\"Developers are becoming more cautious in their land bids - due to slower housing sales post-TDSR,\" said SLP International executive director Nicholas Mak. \"Land prices are likely to continue softening for the next six to nine months, amid weak demand and falling prices of private homes,\" he added.\n\nPutting things into perspective, JLL's Mr Ong noted that yesterday's top bids are the lowest for private residential sites at state tenders since the Vue 8 Residence site in Pasir Ris was sold back in June 2012 for S$418 psf ppr. Besides generally weaker market conditions, the bidders for the latest two sites would have factored unsold inventory in Riverbank@Fernvale and Rivertrees Residences. \"Both were launched in February 2014 and of the combined total stock of 1,050 units, some 52 per cent remained unsold as at end-June 2014.\"\n\nDespite reasonably good take-up at initial launch, sales progress in subsequent months has been slow. \"It shows that the projects' average pricing at S$1,030 to S$1,110 psf is unable to attract sufficient buyers to achieve better sales progress. Consequently bidders at today's tenders would have to bid considerably lower for the sites in order to price the projects more competitively and achieve better sales take-up,\" added Mr Ong.\n\nWhen contacted last night, Raymond Chia, group CEO of Chip Eng Seng, which is leading the consortium that placed top bids for both Fernvale Road plots, said: \"Clinching both sites is more of a strategic move to better manage construction costs and overall planning for the development. We're exploring whether to do separate projects for the two sites or a single development, but we should have nearly 1,400 units in all, encompassing a range of unit sizes.\"\n\nChip Eng Seng is taking the majority 60 per cent stake in the consortium, while a joint venture between Kim Seng Heng Realty and Heeton Homes will hold the balance. \"With both Chip Eng Seng and Kim Seng Heng involved in the construction business, we should be able to contain our costs better,\" said Mr Chia.\n\nThe breakeven costs for the two sites are estimated at around $850-890 psf. And the consortium is hoping to launch the initial phase in first-half next year at around $1,000 psf on average.\n\nAlso bidding for Parcel A yesterday were a City Developments-TID partnership (bidding around S$400 psf ppr), Sim Lian Land (S$361 psf ppr) and Koh Brothers (S$321 psf ppr). Vieing for Parcel B were Flair Development, controlled by Wee Ee Chao (S$418 psf ppr) and Sim Lian Land (S$392 psf ppr).\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And this makes the banks more vulnerable when liquidity dries up, as seen during the global financial crisis.\n\nThe comment comes as the loan-deposit (LDR) ratio in Singapore dollars of United Overseas Bank (UOB) hit 100 per cent in the second quarter - simply put, a dollar from deposits funds a dollar of loans. The LDR ratio is one way to show the extent banks can keep up with the pace that they grow their loan book.\n\nThe Sing-dollar LDR ratio for DBS and OCBC stood at 77 per cent and 82 per cent respectively. DBS has the largest Sing-dollar deposit base of S$136 billion as at June this year. This is followed by UOB's S$106 billion, and OCBC's S$91.7 billion.\n\n\"Banks see this as a structural shift for local banks towards more dependence on wholesale funding, given the tightness in Singapore retail funding,\" said Credit Suisse analyst Anand Swaminathan.\n\nBanks are shifting from the \"crude\" LDR ratio. Under Basel III requirements, banks will soon report funding ratios that seek to ensure banks do not rely on short-term funding. These are the liquidity coverage ratio and the net stable funding ratio.\n\n\"At least under a watchful MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore), they are unlikely to run huge liquidity mismatches. But, these developments mean that local banks are no longer that immune to global liquidity shocks,\" said Mr Swaminathan.\n\nWholesale funding - which includes interbank loans and debt - can dry up in times of stress, and are typically short term. The Basel III regulations are meant to prevent mismatching in maturity and currencies.\n\nAnalysts are also watching the banks' loan growth in the second half. Credit Suisse thinks DBS and OCBC may be running behind loan growth targets for the year, as their Chinese loan book contracted over the quarter.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This came from some weakness in payments from an isolated set of borrowers who had bought high-end properties for investment. UOB's NPL ratio was, however, 1.2 per cent, unchanged from a year ago.\n\nNeither DBS nor OCBC had such stresses in their mortgage-loan portfolio. A separate check by The Business Times showed that for the three banks, property loans in Singapore taken up for owner-occupied homes make up between 77 and 85 per cent of their total home-loan portfolio; the remaining loans are for properties meant for investment.\n\nThe rapt attention on China comes on the back of fake commodity financing in Qingdao, the world's seventh-largest container port. The massive fraud involved multiple creditors holding claims on the same collateral through duplicated receipts.\n\nNotably, both DBS and OCBC have pared down their overall Greater China exposure from a quarter ago, analysts pointed out.\n\nFor DBS, this was a result of risk assessment; OCBC cut back on its China exposure because it saw fewer lending opportunities, with the gap between the borrowing rates for onshore and offshore yuan having been significantly reduced.\n\nBut UOB, which enjoyed a big bump in share price early this year from its limited China exposure, has boosted its presence there, though this is still much lower than its peers', said CIMB analyst Kenneth Ng in a report yesterday.\n\nAt DBS's press briefing, chief executive Piyush Gupta told reporters that the bank does not do trade financing in China that uses commodities as collateral, and that it has no Qingdao exposure.\n\nDBS has some S$50 billion in total loans exposed to China; of that, S$36 billion are trade loans - S$25 billion to customers and another S$11 billion being interbank loans. The bulk of trade loans comprise export letters of credit (LC), and DBS accepts LCs only from top-tier banks.\n\nOCBC's chief executive Samuel Tsien made a similar point, noting the bank's non-involvement in financing for the storage of goods. With warehouse financing, banks take the stored commodities as collateral.\n\nHe also said most of its China-linked loan book of S$27 billion are loans booked here. OCBC categorises loans based on where the credit risk resides; this makes a like-for-like comparison difficult, because DBS and UOB categorise loans based on the borrowers' location.\n\nOf these, S$8 billion are trade-related customer loans, and are mainly for large corporates and state-owned enterprises.\n\nWhile analysts have been assured of little stress in the banks' China and mortgage portfolios, they are watching for flattening margins.\n\nOCBC is guiding for margins to weaken in the quarters to come, though in reporting a 1.7 per cent net interest margin (NIM) - up six basis points from a year ago, and flat from a quarter ago - it has chased up to that of UOB in this respect. UOB has mostly booked the highest margins among its peers in the last few years.\n\nAnalysts were disappointed with UOB's weaker-than-expected NIM, which stood at 1.71 per cent - flat compared to a year ago, and down 2 basis points from a quarter ago.\n\nUOB's non-interest income grew more strongly than its peers' pure banking operations, thanks to net gains from investment securities.\n\nOCBC's non-interest income boost was mainly from contributions from Great Eastern Holdings. And DBS saw weakness from limited hedging activity linked to yuan arbitrage, said Jefferies analyst Krishna Guha in a report.\n\nAnalysts are also flagging further competition for deposits, with all three banks reporting a quarter- on-quarter decline in Singapore-dollar deposits.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

But the setting is a nice breeding ground for all sorts of drama to unfold in the new Cinemax original series, The Knick (short for Knickerbocker), directed entirely by Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh (Ocean's Eleven, Erin Brockovich) and starring Clive Owen (Closer, Sin City).\n\nJust don't expect this to be anything like other TV medical dramas such as General Hospital, ER, House or Grey's Anatomy. Created and written by Jack Amiel and Michael Begler - a pair of screenwriters whose credits until now have revolved around family-friendly, animal- related outings like the remake of The Shaggy Dog with Tim Allen and whale-saving drama The Big Miracle - The Knick takes its viewers on a slaughterhouse tour of \"cutting edge\" medical procedures during the dawn of the Industrial Age, all of which, of course, looks downright barbaric by today's standards.\n\nSoderbergh does Quentin Tarantino proud (no disrespect to the former auteur) with bloody scenes of scalpels slicing flesh open before bare hands dig in to pull out all sorts of diseased innards. At the centre of things is Dr John Thackery (Owen), an arrogant but gifted surgeon who puts the theatre back into operating theatres by performing the gory procedures to a roomful of observers. The man is trying his best to save the sick after he suddenly finds himself in charge of the Knick but can't prevent his patients from dropping dead like flies for reasons beyond his control.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That compared with analysts' average prediction of US$76.6 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe Seattle-based company, the biggest US website for real estate agents and prospective home buyers, also raised its annual sales forecast as advertising and listing revenue surges.\n\nThe all-stock deal for Trulia, unveiled last week, is part of chief executive officer Spencer Rascoff's goal of creating a family of Web brands under the Zillow name that could span sales to rentals to mortgages.\n\n\"Agents are increasingly looking to Zillow as a lead-generation tool,\" said Ronald Josey, an analyst at JMP Securities, who rates the stock the equivalent of a buy. \"As long as these things continue I think that should bode well for the results.\"\n\nThe company's second-quarter net loss was US$10.5 million, or 26 cents a share, compared with a loss of US$10.2 million, or 30 cents, a year earlier. Excluding certain costs, the per-share loss in the recent period was five cents, compared with analysts' average prediction for a loss of four cents.\n\nZillow said revenue from its Premier Agent advertising programme rose 82 per cent, with bookings in that business more than doubling. Traffic on the Web and mobile devices reached 81.1 million average monthly unique users in the quarter, with a record of almost 89 million in July.\n\nThe increase in users \"has created extra impressions available to sell\", Mr Rascoff said in an interview. \"And advertisers follow the audience.\"\n\nThird-quarter sales will rise to US$87 million to US$88 million, exceeding the average analysts' estimate for US$82.7 million. Revenue for the full year will be US$321 million to US$323 million, Zillow said on Tuesday, increasing its forecast from a prior range of US$304 million to US$308 million.\n\nLast week, San Francisco-based Trulia reported second-quarter revenue of US$64.1 million, beating the average analyst estimate of US$62.3 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nA combined Zillow and Trulia would be positioned to capture a larger share of digital real estate ads as more people turn to the Web for house hunting and as property agents deploy more marketing dollars on the Internet.\n\nThe companies estimate that together they would now have less than 4 per cent of the US$12 billion a year real estate advertising market in the US.\n\n\"This quarter was big before the Trulia deal even came together,\" Mr Rascoff said. \"It's too early to say the impact the announcement will have on our businesses.\"\n\nTrulia will be the largest acquisition for Zillow, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Yields for the entire north region inched up to 4.14 per cent from 3.90 per cent last year.\n\nThe central area recorded the smallest improvement in yields to 3.39 per cent, from 3.37 per cent last year.\n\nTopping the list of planning areas are Ang Mo Kio, Yishun and Sembawang in the north, followed by north-eastern areas Sengkang and Hougang. Six planning areas attracted rental yields of 4 per cent or more, including Geylang, which came in sixth.\n\nThe lowest-yielding areas are the prime locations, including Orchard, Newton, Tanglin, River Valley, the Southern Islands (Sentosa Cove) and Bukit Timah. Homes in the Orchard area attracted the lowest gross rental yield of 2.7 per cent.\n\nCommenting on the report, property consultants said this dynamic could shift, with the huge supply of completed condos coming onstream, mainly in the suburbs.\n\nOng Teck Hui, the national research director at JLL, said this year and the next a significant supply of units will enter the rental market, with this coming at a time when expatriate hiring and leasing demand has moderated.\n\n\"The oncoming supply is strongest in the suburban market, and as suburban prices are expected to ease more gradually than in the prime market, it is possible to see suburban yields weaken again if suburban rents fall faster than capital values,\" he said. \"Due to the weakness of the prime sales market, capital values are expected to decline more significantly, so we could see a more stable or slightly improving yield trend for this sub-market.\"\n\nOrangeTee research head Christine Li projects some upside in rental yields in suburban areas this year, as prices correct further ahead of a \"significant downward pressure\" next year and in 2016.\n\nGross yields are typically higher in suburban areas by virtue of the fact that most suburban condos are 99-year leasehold properties that fetch lower prices than freehold properties in the prime central area, said SLP International executive director Nicholas Mak.\n\nInvestors are ultimately seeking stable and sustainable yields, he added, and their property purchase will have to take into account borrowing costs, operating expenses and property tax.\n\n\"Ideally, investors would want to invest in a property that can generate net positive cash-flow,\" he said.\n\nBut rising vacancy rates and the difficulty of securing tenants are weighing on the minds of investors, on the back of URA data showing vacancy rate islandwide spiking to 8.3 per cent in the second quarter; this was higher than the 7.3 per cent in the third quarter of the 2009 recession year.\n\nR'ST Research director Ong Kah Seng said: \"Most buyers are not really judging on yields to buy a private home. When price falls substantially, investors or buyers are more inclined to assume higher vacancy risks.\"\n\nJLL's Mr Ong said that to derive actual net yields that factor in all costs and taxes related to renting out a condo unit, a basket of transacted units is required to track rents and resale prices over time.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Food captivates and unites audiences in ways that other subjects - a cops-and-robbers actioner or a superhero-based blockbuster, say - will not.\n\nUnfortunately, the image that best represents The Hundred-Foot-Journey, directed by Lasse Hallstrom, written by Steven Knight and based on the novel by Richard C Morais, is that of a limp and overcooked asparagus, singled out in an early scene as an example of unacceptable standards at a Michelin-starred restaurant. Like that asparagus, this film had potential - if only the execution wasn't a letdown.\n\nThat particular scene takes place in the spotless kitchen of Le Saule Pleureur, a classic one-star establishment located outside the picturesque village of Saint Antonin-Noble-Val in the south of France. The restaurant has served as a paragon of rustic excellence for 30 years, run with pride and well-polished precision by Madame Mallory (Helen Mirren), whose life is dictated by a desperate desire to win a second star.\n\nHer iron grip on Saint Antonin's culinary scene is unquestioned, but there is a dramatic shift in social dynamics when an immigrant family from India arrives. Hard-headed patriarch Papa Kadam (Om Puri) decides to set up a Bollywood-style restaurant just across the road (100 feet away), much to the chagrin of the snobbish and imperious Madame Mallory.\n\nThe family ran a successful restaurant in Mumbai but when political violence results in a tragedy, Papa moves them to Europe in search of a new life and more peaceful pastures. His trump card is second son Hassan (Manish Dayal), who as a child learnt the culinary ropes from mama (Juhi Chawla). He has a fine touch with Indian spices and the enviable ability to put the authentic flavours of life on a plate. Hassan is not just a talented cook - he also has his eye on Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon), a pretty sous chef from Le Saule Pleureur.\n\nAt first, Marguerite is happy to feed Hassan recipe books, teach him the basics of French cooking and accompany him on picnics in the country but when he demonstrates that his natural flair for cooking extends beyond his Indian roots and into her territory, the relationship sours. Still, their differences are minor compared to those between Mallory and Papa Kadam, who take grim pleasure in sabotaging each other's business.\n\nAn ugly incident involving one of Mallory's chefs results in a truce between the rival restaurateurs, with Hassan declaring his intention to join the French camp - if he can cook an omelette that passes Mallory's taste test. Viewers who recall the lump-in-throat eureka moment in Ratatouille will make inevitable comparisons (but be advised that the rat came out on top).\n\nWith absurdly unrealistic ease, Hassan goes on to wow sophisticated palates in Paris - but his life lacks something more. The same can be said of the cooking scenes, which won't inspire anyone to rush out and buy a copy of Larousse Gastronomique any time soon. This feel-good fairy tale tries to convince us that Michelin stars are no match for the love of a good woman. That could be true of course but after watching The Hundred-Foot Journey, aspiring chefs might still want to take their chances with Michelin.\n\nRating:\n\nC+\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nLifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}

The Dubai-based company says flights are suspended until further notice, citing guidance from health authorities including the US government-backed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nAmong carriers with the greatest exposure to the region, Air France, British Airways and Brussels Airlines - Deutsche Lufthansa AG's main link there - are all continuing flights while screening departing customers. Air France, which serves most West African nations, has imposed special rules for people boarding in Conakry and Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone.\n\n\"Passengers must fill in a questionnaire when entering the airport lounge,\" the Paris-based carrier said. \"They then have their temperature taken within the airport itself. They are only given their boarding card if no medical symptoms are present.\"\n\nThe Ebola outbreak has infected at least 1,440 people since March, killing 826, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in the latest update. Still, the Geneva-based body hasn't issued a travel advisory on the disease and won't before an emergency committee meeting due today and tomorrow, spokesman Gregory Hartl said.\n\nEmirates plans to assess its West African plans in light of feedback from the WHO and CDC. While the former has suggested the risk of visitors catching Ebola is minimal and that special screening isn't likely to prove helpful, the CDC has issued a level-three warning against travel to either Guinea, Sierra Leone or Liberia, the states hit by the disease. The Gulf carrier doesn't serve the latter two nations.\n\nEmirates, whose focus on inter-continental travel means tens of thousands of passengers change planes at its Dubai hub each day, said that services which used to call at Conakry on the way to Dakar will now fly directly to the Senegalese capital, which sits outside the Ebola-afflicted zone.\n\nBrussels Air, in which Lufthansa, Europe's second-largest airline, has a 45 per cent stake, is the only carrier from outside Africa that serves the three Ebola-hit nations, with flight-schedule data firm OAG showing the Belgian operator has about 2,000 seats on offer there between Monday and Sunday.\n\nThe airline is monitoring the situation in the three countries in close cooperation with the WHO and the Tropical Institute in Antwerp, as well as local authorities in Africa, spokeswoman Wencke Lemmes said. It has a combined 11 weekly flights to the three countries and 38 a week to Africa overall. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

Specifics about each property, such as square footage, assessed value and delinquent taxes, are linked to its address. The parcels are mapped geographically.\n\nThe developers, Cristina Garmendia and Alexander Kapur, say their 2013 master's thesis spawned the business, which is nearing the end of its incubation phase at the Harvard Innovation Lab. The mission of OpportunitySpace, they say, is threefold.\n\nA public database can help governments better leverage what has often been \"a lazy asset\", Mr Kapur said. It can give developers an easy way to find upfront information about available properties, and it can provide transparency in publicly owned buildings and land, thus generating more creative thinking around development possibilities.\n\n\"It just seems like the knowledge set for how to invest and develop is limited to such a select group of people that there's an opportunity to use technology and data to open up access to this market,\" Mr Kapur said. \"More competition, more ideas, more visibility, more market transparency will create better outcomes.\"\n\nThough many of its features are still in development, OpportunitySpace just completed a pilot programme with four Rhode Island municipalities, including Providence. The city's inventory - 1,363 publicly owned parcels, including parks and recreational areas - is now posted online. Mayor Angel Taveras said he hoped to eventually make the site accessible from a smartphone.\n\n\"We're trying to remove barriers to redevelopment, making it easier for anyone to find properties available,\" the mayor said. \"We're using technology to provide vital information.\"\n\nDevelopers tend to want to do a lot of \"quiet research\" before opening a conversation with a municipality about a particular property, said Lawrence J Platt, a commercial real estate broker, developer and consultant in Providence.\n\nThey typically use online listing services like LoopNet and CoStar to search for opportunities, but the fees can be prohibitively expense for municipalities.\n\nFor that reason, he sees OpportunitySpace as \"a very logistical starting place\" for municipalities trying to market their properties. \"It's a chance for communities to get into the game in a more cost-effective way,\" he said.\n\nMost cities are \"fairly disorganised\" when it comes to keeping track of their real estate holdings, said Ted Smith, the chief of civic innovation for the Louisville Metro Government, in Kentucky, which served as the host city when Mr Kapur and Ms Garmendia began developing Opportunity- Space. And, he added, the geographic information systems that municipalities do use, such as Esri, are not public.\n\nLouisville is using OpportunitySpace to showcase an old, vacant armoury downtown that is ripe for redevelopment. \"Our aim was to raise the visibility of that armoury before some savvy developer that was clearly pro-forma-driven grabbed it up and pursued whatever vision they had,\" Mr Kapur said. \"There has been a lot of community engagement and discussion around this property.\"\n\nThe database also supported a Louisville-sponsored contest seeking suggestions for creative uses for publicly owned vacant lots. Louis Johnson, an urban designer, worked with a winning team that he said used OpportunitySpace to pinpoint lots in a post-industrial neighbourhood they knew to be experiencing a resurgence. In partnership with a non-profit group, Anchal, Mr Johnson is building a demonstration garden to introduce people to plants that can be used to make natural dyes.\n\nMr Kapur and Ms Garmendia said they were working on layering in additional property information. Other features in the works include maps showing where public investments, subsidies or abatements are focused, master plan details and zoning maps.\n\nThe OpportunitySpace business plan calls for charging cities a manageable subscription fee, but will generate much of its revenue by selling more sophisticated levels of data to the private sector.\n\n\"The success of the venture will depend a lot on how much demand there is for this information and whether it will really make things better,\" said Archon Fung, the academic dean of the Kennedy School and the adviser on the students' thesis. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Property\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up", "images": []}

The net yield could be around 3 per cent.\n\nMarket watchers noted that the slightly over S$2,800 psf pricing based on ongoing negotiations would be the highest for an office block in six years, since the record S$3,125 psf achieved for 71 Robinson Road in April 2008, while it was still under construction. At the time, 71 Robinson Road's site had a balance lease term of about 85 years.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Not just for her work in modern abstract art - she is also one of Japan's foremost modern practitioners of calligraphy.\n\nHer works have been collected by museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Guggenheim. Her most iconic piece is a 28-metre-long mural titled The Past, The Present and The Future, and is currently housed at the Zojo-ji - a temple in Tokyo founded in 1372, which is the headquarters of the Pure Land sect of Buddhism.\n\nShinoda first exhibited in Singapore at the Singapore Art Museum, where hers was one of the first few solo shows that went on display when the museum opened in 1996.\n\nAnd next month, her works will be showcased in Singapore again, this time at the Club 21 Gallery, in an exhibition titled Toko Shinoda - A Lifetime of Continuing Accomplishment. A total of 19 paintings and prints made between 1991 and 2013 will be exhibited, and priced between US$15,000 and US$175,000.\n\nThe artist reveals that one of the painting techniques she enjoys most involves using sumi ink, which starts off in a solid form. She then grinds it on an ink stand, called a suzuri, with water to turn it into a liquid.\n\n\"The colour of the ink which is produced by this method is a very delicate one,\" says the artist. \"It is thus necessary to finish one's work very quickly. So the composition must be determined in my mind before I pick up the brush. Then as they say, the painting just falls off the brush.\"\n\nLuckily for her, inspiration has never been far away, as her sources of inspiration are virtually anything that comes to mind - be it a certain smell, a sound or even a memory of a moment.\n\nDoes she have a favourite painting? Shinoda says: \"I have been painting since I was a young child of six or seven and have created thousands of images. The one that I like the best is often the one that I have just finished, and then quickly it is the one I am about to paint.\"\n\nShe adds: \"My works are like my children and are the most important thing in the world to me. I have worked on it for more than 90 years, and there is nothing I would rather do.\"\n\nHowever, she reveals that these days she seldom paints anymore, and only does so whenever the mood strikes.\n\nAnd for all the decades she has practised her art, Shinoda has just one piece of advice to offer to young aspiring artists - to paint exactly what they want to paint.\n\n\"I am not competitive, and I really am not interested in what other artists bring forth,\" says Shinoda.\n\n\"I paint what I like, and the rest is for the critics. All my life I have devoted myself to my work, never married, belonged to no school or group. I started as an abstract artist and have remained true to my abstract compositions for my whole life. Not many can say that,\" she adds.\n\nToko Shinoda - A Lifetime of Continuing Accomplishment runs from Sept 18 to 27 at Club 21 Galley at #01-05 Four Seasons Hotel. Opening hours are from Mon to Sat, 10am to 8pm, and on Sun and public holidays, 11am to 6pm. Call 6304-1387 for more information\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The JV company has also secured a long-term five-year bare-boat contract with an estimated value of more than US$27 million. The contract value would be almost US$50 million if extension options, subject to mutual agreement between the JV company and the charterer, are fully exercised.\n\nThe vessel will be utilised to support the unnamed charterer, a regional growing offshore and marine services provider, and is expected to be deployed in the regional waters by early next month for the stated initial period of five years.\n\n\"The advantages of this venture are indeed multi-fold but principally, we are able to combine our respective group's strengths in ship-chartering and ship-building to expand our businesses. Tapping on our chartering network, we are exploring the possibilities of the joint ownership of more vessels and indeed we look forward to provide more comprehensive service offerings to our chartering clients,\" said Lee Yun Feng, Marco Polo CEO.\n\nNam Cheong, Malaysia's largest offshore support vessel (OSV) builder, separately announced yesterday that, including the AWV that was sold to the JV company, it has sold four vessels worth some US$90 million. Of the other three vessels, two were sold to two repeat customers - Bumi Armada Berhad and Time Marine Services - and one to a new customer based in Vietnam.\n\nSeparately, Catalist-listed SBI Offshore announced yesterday that it has won a US$24 million design and engineering contract for a jack-up rig with a Middle East-Chinese consortium. The win is in line with SBI's strategy to scale up the value chain to evolve into an integrated solutions provider for the oil and gas industry. This deal marks SBI's transformation to take on more of such larger-scale and higher value projects.\n\nWork on the rig is expected to start in the second half of this year with SBI expecting to progressively recognise revenue in the 2014 and 2015 financial years.\n\nThese announcements come as the offshore & marine sector rides an upward wave of corporate activity in recent times. According to Rajiv Ghatikar, vice-president and general manager of Asean/Australasia at Siemens PLM Software, robust capital investments in global exploration and production (E&P) projects in 2014, fuelled by rising global oil and energy prices, are keeping new orders buzzing for Singapore-based companies. This, he added, is underpinned by a rise in energy demand, especially since improving economic conditions in China and the US are increasing the demand for oil and gas.\n\nMoreover, Mr Ghatikar added, the demand for new rigs is strong given the ageing rig fleet and the increasing focus by oil companies for new, safer and more efficient rig units. \"Drilling contractors are reporting favourable underlying fundamentals in the deepwater drilling market. With the anticipated increased E&P spending and activities in deepwaters, the outlook for floating production systems will encourage demand for more or new offshore support vessels and anchor handling tug supply vessels.\"\n\nShares of Marco Polo closed trading yesterday at 35.5 Singapore cents, up 2.5 cents while Nam Cheong closed at 48 Singapore cents, up one cent. SBI ended at 14.5 cents, up 0.7 cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Only the Honda and Nissan agents are said to have been absent.\n\nOne person who was there commented that it's been \"a long time\" since he had seen so many brands in the same room.\n\nSingapore already has a grouping of new car distributors called the Motor Traders Association of Singapore (MTA) but membership has been dwindling either because of competitive reasons or dissatisfaction with the MTA itself.\n\nThe top three makes - Toyota, Mercedes-Benz and BMW - are currently not in the MTA. Mercedes- Benz left in 2009, followed shortly by BMW, while Toyota quit in March this year, thus leaving Volkswagen as the biggest brand there. VW was ranked Singapore's No 4 make in 2013.\n\nAs a result, MTA members currently account for only 32 per cent of the market, based on last year's total vehicle sales of 34,090 units, or less than a third. This led some to question its relevance as the voice of new car sellers.\n\n\"It is important to be represented by a strong body, especially when policy changes are coming so fast,\" said the managing director of a mid-sized brand.\n\nThe meeting was also understood to be a response by the distributors to the way the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has been \"engaging us individually instead of as a group\". One example was consultations with distributors regarding the recategorisation of COE Category A to include an output cap. \"This means our voice will not be as strong because everyone will protect their own interests instead of looking at the big picture and the interests of the whole market,\" said the managing director.\n\nHe added: \"So I suppose you can say the meeting was about how to revamp the MTA and make it more effective, even though it was essentially to rally the distributors to come together to work for the common good.\"\n\nMTA committee members were also present at Tuesday's assembly although MTA president Glenn Tan was away on business. Mr Tan is also executive director of TCIL, the importer of Nissan and Subaru here.\n\nThe managing director said another issue is that there are now more government departments that motor distributors have to deal with because of, for instance, emission, licensing and financing issues.\n\n\"It is no longer just one authority,\" he said, citing besides LTA, the National Environment Agency, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Trade and Industry.\n\n\"We want to have a strong industry body that can talk directly to the decision makers of these departments. This will help not only our product planning and sales forecasts, but also the manufacturer's budgets and their factories' product mix. Right now, it is difficult with so many changes. We want a smoother path going forward.\"\n\nBut it won't be a one-way dialogue, according to the CEO of a luxury dealership.\n\n\"As international brands, we can share technological advances and industry trends,\" he explained. \"With industry input, the government can use this platform to define more effective automotive policies in future.\"\n\nFor now, the discussions are at an exploratory stage, with the next meeting scheduled for September although no date has been fixed yet. But already, there are some encouraging signs.\n\n\"Our diverse interests mean that everyone is talking at cross-purposes,\" said the boss of a major dealership. \"Japanese brands only talk about Japanese cars, and German brands talk about European standards. But if there is a common goal, I will commit to returning to the MTA fold.\"\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

The steel industry is becoming global, he said.\n\n\"It's important to increase assets in overseas markets rather than in Japan,\" Mr Shindo said in Sao Paulo on the sidelines of a business seminar between Brazilian and Japanese companies. \"We must follow the increase of steel demand in overseas markets.\"\n\nThe Tokyo-based producer, formed by the merger of Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Industries in October 2012, said last week that profit in the June quarter fell 24 percent as steel imports from China put pressure on prices.\n\nBrazil, Latin America's largest producer of the metal used in ships, cars and buildings, is \"an important area\" for Nippon Steel, and operations at Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA, a Brazilian steelmaker that Nippon co-controls, are \"precious,\" Mr Shindo said.\n\n\"We are now globalising in every part of the world,\" he said.\n\nMr Shindo, Toyota Motor chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial president Koichi Miyata are among the Japanese businessmen travelling in Brazil with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as he wraps up a tour encompassing six Latin American and Caribbean cities in nine days.\n\nThe Japanese leader, whose policy of unprecedented monetary easing and economic stimulus has been dubbed Abenomics, is urging Japanese companies to seek more business outside their domestic market. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nBRC Asia secures contracts for Changi Airport Terminal 5 project worth S$570 million\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:04 PM\n\nDollar-selling is becoming a bubble, which may burst, HSBC says\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:03 PM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM", "images": []}

Now they face a bigger challenge.\n\nMr Zell and one of his longtime deputies, David Helfand, must remake the Chicago-based office landlord after an ouster of top executives based on claims of mismanagement and a misdirected strategy. They're in charge of a disparate group of more than 100 properties in US suburbs and markets where rent growth is slower than in big cities such as New York and San Francisco.\n\n\"There will be significant - I hesitate to use the word radical - but very significant changes to the portfolio in the coming quarters,\" said Ian Goltra, a real estate fund manager at San Francisco-based Forward Management LLC, which oversees about US$5 billion of assets.\n\nMr Helfand and Mr Zell, the 72-year-old billionaire who founded the biggest US apartment owner, will have to examine holdings that stretch from San Diego to Hartford, Connecticut, and decide which Equity Commonwealth properties to keep, which to spruce up and which to sell. The changes come after a yearlong campaign led by Related Cos and Corvex Management LP to oust the previous board, claiming that the company had conflicts of interest and was making high-priced acquisitions while selling real estate at low prices. The new strategy is still in flux.\n\n\"Equity Commonwealth is in the process of a significant transition, during which the management team and trustees are evaluating all aspects of the company's operations,\" the real estate investment trust said in its second-quarter earnings statement last week.\n\nCorvex and Related won the shareholder vote to overthrow the previous board of the company, then known as CommonWealth Reit, in March and installed Mr Zell as chairman and Mr Helfand as chief executive officer in May.\n\nThe investors were critical of the prior management's strategy of selling suburban buildings and buying properties in downtowns across the US. They also said the landlord wasn't paying enough attention to its buildings, failing to boost income to the levels it could have.\n\nProper staffing levels and reinvesting in the company's properties \"can harvest a substantial amount of 'low-hanging fruit',\" Related and Corvex said in a January presentation.\n\nSelling may now be a good option for some of Equity Commonwealth's buildings, John Guinee, a Baltimore-based analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co who recommends buying the shares, said. Many of the properties are considered Class B, which generally are older and have higher vacancies.\n\nDemand from investors for office properties is high, Mr Guinee said. Office rents in US metropolitan areas, bolstered by a growing economy, rose to an average of US$23.83 a square foot in the second quarter from US$23.24 a year earlier, according to New York-based data provider Reis Inc.\n\n\"The investment-sale market for B and C quality product is as aggressive as it's been in the last 10 years, which results in excellent proceeds for selling stuff that you couldn't give away four years ago,\" Mr Guinee said.\n\nSarah Byrnes, a spokeswoman for Equity Commonwealth, and Joanna Rose, a Related spokeswoman, declined to comment on the company's strategy. Jason Fredette, a spokesman for Reit Management & Research LLC, former President Adam Portnoy's firm, also declined to comment. Rupal Doshi of New York-based Corvex didn't respond to an e-mail seeking comment.\n\nAbout 63 per cent of Equity Commonwealth's revenue in the second quarter came from downtown buildings, with the rest coming from the suburbs, according to an Aug 5 filing. The company owned 156 properties in the period. Fourteen were sold in June for US$215.9 million.\n\n\"There's probably some stuff in the portfolio that really should be sold at a mothball price,\" said Mr Goltra, whose firm owns no Equity Commonwealth stock because of its valuation.\n\nMr Zell's familiar with getting the most for investors, having engineered the US$39 billion sale of his Equity Office Properties Trust to Blackstone Group LP in 2007, around the last peak of the property market.\n\nHe's also chairman of Equity Residential, the biggest publicly traded multifamily landlord, and Equity LifeStyle Properties Inc, an owner of manufactured-home communities. Equity Residential has risen 21 per cent in the past year and Equity LifeStyle is up 19 per cent, outperforming a 15 per cent gain in the Bloomberg Reit Apartment Index and a 9 per cent increase in the broader Bloomberg gauge of property trusts.\n\nA group led by Mr Zell exercised options to acquire more than 4 million Equity Commonwealth shares from Related and Corvex, according to a July regulatory filing. Related and Corvex now each own 2.8 per cent of the company, down from almost 10 per cent combined during their campaign.\n\nMr Zell is \"a great figurehead, and there's no downside to that,\" Mr Guinee said. \"He was basically brought on to get the vote.\" Mr Zell has already put his stamp on the office company by trading the name CommonWealth Reit for the \"Equity\" branding, moving the company's headquarters to his hometown of Chicago from Newton, Massachusetts, and disposing of US$704.8 million of shares in Select Income REIT, a single-tenant property landlord.\n\nEquity Commonwealth is considering reducing the quarterly dividend paid by the previous leadership, which was 25 cents a share, according to a regulatory filing last month.\n\nCutting the payment is a good move because it would allow the company to reinvest in properties, Mr Goltra said.\n\nSo far, the changes have benefited shareholders. Equity Commonwealth has gained 66 per cent from Feb 25, 2013, the day before Corvex and Related disclosed their stake in the company, through Tuesday. They have risen 2.2 per cent since Mr Zell and other board members were elected by shareholders.\n\n\"We're happy with their initial moves,\" said Rob Lynch, director of research at Westchester Capital Management LLC in Valhalla, New York, which has US$5.5 billion under management, including about 3 million Equity Commonwealth shares and options as of March 31. \"We recognise that repositioning the portfolio will take some time.\"\n\nThe biggest winners may be Related and Corvex. In addition to benefiting from the gain in Equity Commonwealth's share price, they will be reimbursed as much as US$33.5 million for expenses related to the campaign to throw out the board. Under a plan approved by stockholders on July 31, half that payment is contingent upon Equity Commonwealth's share performance next year and in 2016.\n\nAfter transforming the company and its investments, Equity Commonwealth's new managers may be able to seek a buyer for the Reit - perhaps a large private-equity fund, Mr Goltra said.\n\n\"That would take a lot of work, obviously,\" he said. \"That would be way down the road.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM", "images": []}

A separate PMI from HSBC Holdings plc and Markit Economics rose to an 18-month high of 51.7. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.\n\nThe data signal the world's two largest economies are gaining momentum, after the US this week reported a 4 per cent pace of expansion in the second quarter.\n\nA gauge of smaller manufacturers in China's official PMI rose above 50 for the first time since March 2012, suggesting Premier Li Keqiang's stimulus is reaching its targets.\n\n\"The government has been putting a lot of emphasis on the targeted easing measures, tailoring to the small-medium enterprises,\" Chang Jian, chief China economist at Barclays plc in Hong Kong, said on Bloomberg Television. \"Growth seems to be stabilising and the government would be able to focus more of its energy on the reform agenda in the second half of this year.\"\n\nThe HSBC-Markit PMI, which is based on a survey of more than 420 companies, compared with a preliminary reading of 52.0 issued on July 24, which was also the median estimate for Thursday's final number. June's reading was 50.7.\n\nA gauge of output in Thursday's official report jumped to 54.2, the highest reading since November, and a measure of new orders increased to 53.6, the highest since April 2012. Export orders rose for a third month to 50.8, the highest level since March 2013.\n\nThe business situation for small companies has turned around, which shows that preferential policies have taken effect and the macroeconomic environment has improved, the logistics federation said in a statement.\n\nChina's gross domestic product rose 7.5 per cent in the April-June period from a year earlier, the first acceleration in three quarters.\n\nThe improvement from a 7.4 per cent pace in the first three months of the year came after the government ordered targeted stimulus including tax cuts for small companies and speeding up public investment and fiscal spending. The central bank cut reserve requirements for some banks and turned to unconventional tools such as relending to boost credit.\n\n\"The economy is clearly improving, driven mostly by government infrastructure investment including railways and subways,\" said Shen Jianguang, chief Asia economist at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd in Hong Kong. \"But the pick-up in manufacturing may not be enough to counter a property slump\", and the government will keep easing credit, fiscal and housing policies to achieve its growth goal of about 7.5 per cent, Mr Shen added.\n\nA profit warning on Thursday from China Rongsheng Heavy Industries Group Holdings Ltd, the country's second-largest private shipbuilder, highlights the difficulties many companies are still facing amid industrial overcapacity and sluggish demand.\n\nRongsheng expects a \"significant increase\" in its net loss in the first half after customers cancelling orders forced it to cut production, according to a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange.\n\nThe biggest short-term risk to the economy is real estate, Markus Rodlauer, mission chief for China at the International Monetary Fund, said on a conference call this week to discuss its annual report on the country. Prices and sales of residential properties are declining and inventories are rising, government data show. UBS AG estimates real estate accounts for more than a quarter of final demand in the economy.\n\nLocal authorities are starting to loosen curbs on home buying. Hohhot, capital of Inner Mongolia, became the first city to scrap restrictions in June, followed by eastern cities including Jinan, Wuxi, Wenzhou, Hangzhou and Ningbo.\n\nA gauge of property stocks in Shanghai rose 11.5 per cent in July, the biggest monthly gain since December 2012, on optimism the easing, along with prospects for reform of the household registration system, will spur sales.\n\nWith growth stabilising, the government can focus more on economic-policy shifts, said Ms Chang of Barclays. The Communist Party this week announced a probe into former security chief Zhou Yongkang, a move that signals President Xi Jinping has amassed enough power to implement changes to reduce the state's role in the economy and help sustain expansion, according to analysts including Ms Chang.\n\n\"The government is trying to buy themselves some time and to stabilise growth, creating a more conducive environment to push for reform,\" Ms Chang said.

The lawsuit has since been \"settled amicably out of court\", Mr Ng said, without revealing the settlement terms.\n\nARA undertook minor refurbishments for some of the condo units before releasing them for sale to individual buyers. However, sales have slowed since property cooling measures were imposed. ADF I has so far sold 40 of the 53 units at below S$3,000 psf on average.\n\nAfter this episode, ARA was more circumspect about using Fund II of the ADF series for residential investments, Mr Ng said. ADF II has since invested over 70 per cent of its US$441 million funds in commercial properties in China and a residential project in Malaysia.\n\nThough ARA has lately been approached for potential bulk condo purchases, Mr Ng said the prices are \"not cheap enough, considering the high transaction costs\".\n\n\"We recognise that there are stresses in the market and, potentially, we could buy the whole lot of units or take over the company that owns these units,\" he added. \"But don't forget, when you take over a company that owns these units, the qualifying certificate (QC) rules will make it very challenging.\"\n\nThe QC rules require most developers here to pay extension fees for leftover condo units that are not sold within two years from the project completion. If ARA buys over the units as a foreign institutional fund, the additional buyers' stamp duty of 15 per cent kicks in, on top of the 3 per cent buyers' stamp duty. If the units are then sold within four years, the sellers' stamp duty based on price or market value also kicks in.\n\n\"When you add up, as much as a quarter of your costs is going to taxes,\" Mr Ng said. \"You need to find a deal that is sufficiently cheap, almost distressed pricing, to be compensated for all these risks. But today, I don't think we have reached the time yet.\"\n\nThere is also the social-political risk to contend with when it comes to residential market in Asia, he added. \"Given some of the stresses in the market now, it pays to be patient.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the acquisition of Suntec Singapore International Convention & Exhibition Centre in 2009 turned out to be a bonanza for investors of ARA Harmony Fund, the single-asset private fund set up to acquire the asset. In the same year, ARA acquired the property manager of Suntec City and the MICE manager of Suntec Singapore and aided their overseas expansion since.\n\nSignificant returns were derived from the conversion of convention space on the first and second floors of the Suntec convention centre into retail space. Attributing this to \"good fortune\", Mr Ng explained that obtaining government approval for the conversion was a wild card given that the previous owner had failed to do so.\n\nBut the convention business landscape was starting to change with competition from the two integrated resorts and from other countries vying to become MICE (meetings, incentive travel, conferences and exhibitions) destinations, he recalled. Major capital spending was required to keep Suntec convention centre relevant, so adding the retail space would provide the income to justify the very substantial capital spending.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the application for the partial change in the use of space became possible, Mr Ng said. And \"by some clever redesign of the convention centre\", the total convention space was intact, if not bigger.\n\nInitial investors of the top-performing ARA-managed fund exited in 2011, tucking in a handsome IRR of 65 per cent. City Harvest Church joined the club since 2010 with a S$310 million stake acquisition of Harmony Fund while Suntec Reit shored up its stake in the fund from 20 per cent to 60.8 per cent.\n\nBesides managing property trusts and private equity funds, ARA also manages separate accounts for selected investors with specific investment objectives. The latter include a US$830 million portfolio for California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), a US$240 million portfolio for a US public pension fund, and a S$842 million portfolio belonging to the Straits Trading Company.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Aug 1, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nEXCITING, revolutionary, visionary - all these words aptly describe the BMW i3 electric vehicle - not only for the way it is designed and built, but also for introducing electric mobility even before a proper charging infrastructure has been set up here.\n\nIt goes on sale for S$228,800, or about the price of a 328i sports sedan. But instead of BMW's trademark straight six internal combustion engine in the 3 Series, the i3 has a synchronous electric motor to drive the rear wheels.\n\nThat isn't the only difference. Various electric models by other auto manufacturers currently on trial here merely replace the conventional powertrain of a steel-bodied car with an electric motor and battery cells. The i3 is constructed differently, with an aluminium frame to which the wheels and suspension components are attached and lithium-ion batteries packed within, plus a carbon fibre passenger cell protected by a thermoplastic external skin on top.\n\nIn the version called the BMW i3 Range Extender - the only one available here now - there is also a 650cc petrol engine to serve as an onboard generator and extend the i3's driving range through a nine-litre fuel tank. A fully charged i3 is good for up to 160 km; the range extender doubles this. Theoretically. In Singapore, with the heavy use of the air-con and, depending on one's driving style, the total range in Comfort mode is only about 200 km.\n\nBeing on Eco Pro and Eco Pro+, which limit acceleration, speed and air-con operation, increases the range, but these are unlikely to be used by anyone who enjoys driving. The i3, with its instantaneous torque and low centre of gravity, is an extremely fun car with breathtaking acceleration and handling. Floor the accelerator and maximum torque is available from zero rpm, allowing the i3 to zip from stationary to 100 kmh in 7.9 seconds.\n\nThe instant torque is matched by immediate retardation because as soon as you lift off the accelerator, the electric motor engages in energy recuperation, resulting in strong deceleration. This is perfect for spirited driving because you rarely need to use the brake pedal to slow down. In fact, depending on your speed, taking your foot off the accelerator can cause the i3 to come to a virtual standstill.\n\nThe combination of a lightweight bodyshell on a heavy chassis endows the i3 with a very low centre of gravity, and it corners flat on big 19-inch wheels with skinny tyres. Still, it is weighed down by the lithium-ion battery pack and the 120 kg range extender, so at 1,315 kg, this electric mini is about as heavy as a conventional German hatchback in steel.\n\nInside, the airy i3 cabin will remind you of its green credentials, with eco-friendly natural materials on the one-piece seats and instrument panel.\n\nIf not for the steering wheel, the cabin could be a workstation in a modern office, with two flat screen displays and a dinky column mounted gear lever that looks more like an oversized switch. All four occupants in this 4-m long car with a 2,570 mm wheelbase sit higher than in a normal BMW sedan. But it has a few features that make it the perfect city car: one is Active Cruise Control - which lets it maintain a specified distance from the car in front when cruise control is activated; another is Parking Assistant, for fully autonomous parallel parking. Then there is the Connected Drive app, which tracks usage and consumption and even shares the data with a community of i3 users.\n\nWhile the range is much shorter than an ordinary car's, there is surprisingly little anxiety once you've worked out your travel pattern and can determine when you are able to plug into your complimentary Wallbox home charging station again.\n\nThen there is the safety net provided by the range extender.\n\nThanks to the BMW i3, it looks like electric mobility has finally arrived.\n\nsamuelee@sph.com.sg\n\nSPECS\n\nBMW i3 (Range Extender)\n\nElectric motor:\n\nPower\n\n170 hp\n\nTorque\n\n150 Nm\n\nGearbox\n\nSingle-speed auto transmission\n\n0-100 kmh\n\n7.9 secs\n\nTop speed\n\n150 kmh\n\nRange extender generator:\n\nEngine\n\n647cc inline-2\n\nPower\n\n34 hp @ 4,300 rpm\n\nTorque\n\n55 Nm @ 4,300 rpm\n\nCO2 emissions\n\n13 g/km\n\nAverage OMV\n\nS$50,000\n\nPrice\n\nfrom S$228,800 (with COE)\n\nDistributor\n\nPerformance Motors\n\nTel\n\n6319 0100\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

On Monday, the price of bitcoin dropped nearly 12 per cent, to US$435.60 from US$492.95, according to the virtual currency website CoinDesk, its lowest value since May and far below its peak of about US$1,150 last year.\n\nAlso on Monday, the price briefly plummeted to US$309 on BTC-e, an exchange with shadowy backing, in what some in the industry called bitcoin's version of a \"flash crash\". That collapse, however, was short-lived, and the price quickly recovered to where it was trading before. The virtual currency also regained some of its lost ground to return to trading around US$460 late on Monday.\n\nYet, despite the latest one-day swing, bitcoin's price has been steadily falling in recent weeks, a trend that follows a period of relative stability since February when the bitcoin exchange Mt Gox collapsed.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Wealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

Flights to Asia and other parts of the Middle East also would continue to detour around Iraq, Europe's largest airline by revenue said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nThe changes in flight routes would apply to Lufthansa, Lufthansa Cargo, Austrian Airlines and Swiss, the carrier said, adding that the new flight routes would not significantly lengthen flight times.Lufthansa's decision came a day after Royal Jordanian - one of the main airlines serving Iraq - said it had suspended all flights to Baghdad for at least 24 hours for security reasons.\n\nMajor airlines last week decided to stop flights to certain conflict areas, a move that came in the wake of the June 17 downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 over an embattled zone in eastern Ukraine, which killed 298 people aboard.

It is almost like a magic trick,\" said Mr Nohl, whose research firm is known for uncovering major flaws in mobile phone technology.\n\nThe finding shows that bugs in software used to run tiny electronics components that are invisible to the average computer user can be extremely dangerous when hackers figure out how to exploit them. Security researchers have increasingly turned their attention to uncovering such flaws.\n\nMr Nohl said his firm has performed attacks by writing malicious code onto USB control chips used in thumb drives and smartphones. Once the USB device is attached to a computer, the malicious software can log keystrokes, spy on communications and destroy data, he said.\n\nComputers do not detect the infections when tainted devices are inserted because anti-virus programs are only designed to scan for software written onto memory and do not scan the \"firmware\" that controls the functioning of those devices, he said.\n\nMr Nohl said he would not be surprised if intelligence agencies, like the National Security Agency, have already figured out how to launch attacks using this technique.\n\nLast year, he presented research at Black Hat on breakthrough methods for remotely attacking SIM cards on mobile phones. In December, documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden demonstrated that the US spy agency was using a similar technique for surveillance, which it called \"Monkey Calendar\". An NSA spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nSR Labs tested the technique by infecting controller chips made by major Taiwanese manufacturer Phison Electronics Corp and placing them in USB memory drives and smartphones running Google Inc's Android operating system.\n\nAlex Chiu, an attorney with Phison, told Reuters via email that Mr Nohl had contacted the company about his research in May. \"Mr Nohl did not offer detailed analysis together with work product to prove his finding,\" Mr Chiu said. \"Phison does not have ground to comment (on) his allegation.\"\n\nMr Chiu said that \"from Phison's reasonable knowledge and belief, it is hardly possible to rewrite Phison's controller firmware without accessing our confidential information\".\n\nSimilar chips are made by Silicon Motion Technology Corp and Alcor Micro Corp. Mr Nohl said his firm did not test devices with chips from those manufacturers.\n\nMr Nohl believed hackers would have a \"high chance\" of corrupting other kinds of controller chips besides those made by Phison, because their manufacturers are not required to secure software. He said those chips, once infected, could be used to infect mice, keyboards and other devices that connect via USB. \"The sky is the limit. You can do anything at all,\" he said.\n\nIn his tests, Mr Nohl said he was able to gain remote access to a computer by having the USB instruct the computer to download a malicious program with instructions that the PC believed were coming from a keyboard. He was also able to change what are known as DNS network settings on a computer, essentially instructing the machine to route Internet traffic through malicious servers.\n\nOnce a computer is infected, it could be programmed to infect all USB devices that are subsequently attached to it, which would then corrupt machines that they contact. \"Now all of your USB devices are infected. It becomes self-propagating and extremely persistent,\" Mr Nohl said. \"You can never remove it.\"\n\nChristof Paar, a professor of electrical engineering at Germany's University of Bochum who reviewed the findings, said he believed the new research would prompt others to take a closer look at USB technology, and potentially lead to the discovery of more bugs. He urged manufacturers to improve protection of their chips to thwart attacks.\n\n\"The manufacturer should make it much harder to change the software that runs on a USB stick,\" Prof Paar said. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Technology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

He continues to churn out films at a rate of roughly one a year, but these days, he relies on younger surrogates to mouth his words. In Magic in the Moonlight, Allen's 44th feature film (and counting), Colin Firth steps into a role in which the director might once have cast himself.\n\nAs master magician Stanley Crawford, Firth plays a pompous snob with a caustic wit, an unshakable belief in rational thinking and a strong disdain for anything remotely spiritual. As a non-believer, he can spot phony people a mile away and takes great pleasure in putting them down.\n\nIn recent years Allen has set many of his films in Europe - perhaps because he relishes depicting the empty lives and idiosyncrasies of the privileged classes. Magic in the Moonlight is not one of his better films, however; it feels flimsy in parts and the narrative is a little forced.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member in 2 minutes to keep reading.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\nS$9.90\n\n/\n\nmonth\n\nsave 50%\n\nYearly recurring\n\nS$4.95\n\n/\n\nmonth\n\nBilled yearly\n\n118.8\n\nS$59.40\n\nContinue reading\n\nCancel anytime\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Buoyed by an increase in new orders and higher production and inventory levels, Singapore's latest Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) surpassed expectations, rising 1.0 to 51.5 in July and marking a one-year high.\n\nThe better-than-anticipated reading caught private-sector economists by surprise; the seven polled by Bloomberg had earlier forecast a reading of 50.7.\n\nA reading above 50 denotes growth, while one under 50 points to a contraction in the manufacturing sector.\n\nSaid CIMB economist Song Seng Wun: \"Given the overall downward trend that we've seen in industrial production and export numbers, there was this expectation that we'd get another uninspiring set of PMI readings. But July's numbers seem to imply that manufacturers are looking a lot busier than we thought they would be - so the numbers are really a bit surprising, and supportive of a second half recovery.\"\n\nThe electronics sector continued to expand in July, with its PMI rising 1.7 to 52.4 - significantly above the market's forecast of 50.9.\n\nMuch of the boost came from new orders from both domestic and overseas markets; production output and inventory posted higher readings as well.\n\nReferring to the 1.7 increase as \"quite a strong uptick\", UOB economist Francis Tan said: \"New orders were up 2.0 and the production index rose 2.6 - so at least on the production side, this seems to be painting quite a bright picture for a couple of months ahead.\"\n\nThe index - seen as a barometer of manufacturing activity - is compiled by the Singapore Institute of Purchasing & Materials Management, which polls more than 150 industrial companies each month.\n\nApart from Mr Song and Mr Tan, economists from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BOAML) and OCBC also say they now have a more favourable outlook for the second half of this year. Apart from July's PMI performance, they also cite improving global economic conditions, which should provide some uplift here.\n\nBut even as economists were cheered by the latest PMI figure, many were quick to qualify that actual outcomes may not be so sanguine, since there is no direct correlation between PMI and economic performance.\n\nSaid BOAML economist Chua Hak Bin: \"July's PMI looked good, and we're hopeful this means there is a turning point - that these numbers will translate into better industrial production and exports performance. But we've seen some false starts before.\n\n\"If we had gone with the first six months of this year where PMI held up fairly well, things should have been alright in the manufacturing sector - but that's not what we've seen in the figures recently. In fact, exports and industrial production have shown broad-based contractions.\"\n\nAs such, while Dr Chua thinks the latest PMI numbers are \"encouraging\", he is unsure how much of this will actually translate into a better manufacturing and exports performance.\n\nDBS economist Irvin Seah added that \"an overhanging structural drag\" still exists, and this would adversely affect the manufacturing sector (a pick-up in the global economy notwithstanding).\n\nMr Song and Mr Tan also have their misgivings. Said the former: \"The PMI is not weighted, so certain groups of companies polled could swing the numbers around, if they are much more optimistic than the norm.\"\n\nUOB's Mr Tan also noted how seasonal effects could be at play: \"Historically, June, July, and August are the strongest months of the whole year (in terms of manufacturing activity), since factories are rushing to fulfil end-of-year orders. So that could water down any optimism about July's reading.\"\n\nSingapore's last month's PMI performance was largely in keeping with the rest of the region, which showed firmer readings for new orders and output. The pick-up was especially strong in Taiwan (a rise of 1.8 to 55.8) and India (a rise of 1.5 to 53).\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The timeline for that project and the details including its financing are still vague, Mr Adly said.\n\nOfficials spoke in more detail about the new waterway, saying that the military would lead the effort to dig it, at a cost of US$4 billion, and would supervise Egyptian companies picked to participate in the project.\n\nThe funds would be raised by selling bonds to Egyptian banks and individuals, including citizens overseas, el-Sissi said.\n\nStill, some are sceptical that the work could be completed in a year, as Mr el-Sissi had ordered.\n\n\"It's a heavy project,\" said Sherine Hassan, a retired Egyptian admiral and maritime expert who supports the plan. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nRECOMMENDED", "images": []}

Debbie Yong looks at the recent resurgence and potential pitfalls of subscription retail services in Singapore, and highlights a few notable ones.\n\nPublished Fri, Aug 15, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT SEEMS like a no-brainer. Man has needs (or wants). Man is lazy. Subscription retail programmes deliver those needs (and wants) to Man's doorstep on a regular basis - all at the click of a mouse. Man is happy. Pioneered by four-year-old American start-up Birchbox, subscription box services are now dime-a-dozen in the United States and Europe - and the innovative retail format is fast becoming a way of life here too, with more than 10 of such new services launched in the first eight months of this year, by everyone from local actresses to mum-preneurs and former bankers.\n\nThe subscription retail model works like this: buyers commit to a one-month, three-month, six-month or an annual subscription for a box containing typically four to eight items curated according to a theme to be mailed to them on a monthly basis.\n\nThe items can be trial-sized samples obtained for free from brands who want to market a new product to a niche group of customers, or travel and full-sized products purchased by the box curators, who typically also run e-commerce stores for repeat orders.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Sales of recreational goods as well as watches & jewellery fell, data from the Department of Statistics (DOS) indicated yesterday.\n\nThe total sales value for June was S$3.2 billion, marginally up from S$3.1 billion a year ago, the DOS said.\n\nMay retail sales fell a sharper 6 per cent year on year, dragged down by sales of motor vehicles; month on month, however, sales were 5.2 per cent higher.\n\nIn June, sales of motor vehicles jumped 12.4 per cent year on year. Compared to May, it was down 0.3 per cent.\n\nBesides motor vehicles, the categories which also recorded year-on-year growth were petrol service stations (4.6 per cent), medical goods & toiletries (2.8 per cent) and food & beverage (2.9 per cent).\n\nSectors reporting a contraction in sales between June 2013 and June this year included recreational goods (-10.1 per cent), telecommunications apparatus & computers (-7.6 per cent) and watches & jewellery (-7 per cent).\n\nWhen comparing month-on- month figures, retail sales fell by a seasonally adjusted 1.1 per cent in June, and were down 1.2 per cent when sales of motor vehicles were excluded.\n\nSales of telecommunications apparatus & computers slumped 9.3 per cent; those of recreational goods were 8.1 per cent lower.

On the other hand, turnover of other eating places such as cafes and canteens rose 1.2 per cent. The total sales value for the month was around S$631 million.\n\nMonth on month, seasonally adjusted sales of F&B services were lower by 1.9 per cent, as caterers, restaurants and other eating places all collected lower receipts. Only fast food outlets grew their sales by a marginal 0.5 per cent.\n\nThe DOS puts together the retail sales and food & beverage indices from data gathered from 4,800 establishments covered in the monthly retail sales and F&B services surveys.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.
