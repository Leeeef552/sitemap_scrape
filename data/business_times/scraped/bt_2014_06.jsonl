The face of Neymar, who changed haircuts and hair colour during the tournament before sporting a blond top, is everywhere: on advertising billboards, television commercials and in the hearts of his admirers.\n\nHis female fans scream when they see him, collect any Neymar souvenir, scan the Internet for the latest details of his life and talk about him in Web chatrooms.\n\nWith long reddish hair and nails painted in green, Ms Andrade comes from a middle-class family living in Brasilia.\n\nShe has covered her bedroom with posters of the striker. She collects folders filled with newspaper articles about him.\n\nUnable to score tickets for Brazil-Cameroon in Brasilia last week, she went to the pre-game practice hoping to get his attention.\n\n\"He knows I exist. My biggest dream is to kiss him and tell him I love him, that if he has a problem I will always be by his side,\" she says.\n\nWatching the game at home, she welled up after Neymar netted in the 4-1 victory.\n\nHer passion for Neymar began five years ago after an epileptic crisis. \"I wasn't interested in any particular player but when I turned 12, I became very sick,\" she says.\n\nShe was unable to walk or go school and risked being paralysed.\n\nSpending hours at home on the Internet, Ms Andrade found comfort in Neymar, who played for Brazilian club Santos at the time. \"I didn't see anybody. I had no friends. I became passionate about him,\" she says.\n\n\"I started reading books, doing searches about him and his family. I bought everything about him. His joy of life took away my sadness of having no contacts,\" Ms Andrade adds.\n\nShe has overcome her illness but the passion has remained. \"We Neymarzetes must know everything about him to hit back at critics,\" she says.\n\nShe follows the star on Twitter and sends him several messages.\n\n\"Sometimes we think that he could spend more time with us but he has to work, he has a son and his family,\" the fan says.\n\nNeymar knows about the Neymarzete movement and regularly addresses them.\n\n\"He responded to one of my messages once during the London Olympic Games. I had written 'good luck, ready to score a goal?' and he replied: 'Not just one, but two.' That night, he scored two goals,\" Ms Andrade says.\n\nBrazil lost to Mexico in the Olympic final, taking home the silver medal. But Neymarzetes believe he can lead Brazil to a record-extending sixth World Cup. \"He will become the best player in the world back in his homeland,\" Ms Andrade says.\n\nHis transfer to Barcelona last year broke the hearts of many fans who wanted him to keep playing closer to them in Brazil.\n\n\"We hoped that he would stay. We were crushed when he announced his departure,\" Ms Andrade says. \"But then he did an interview in which he said 'I will never abandon my Neymarzetes'.\"\n\nMs Andrade has a boyfriend but she insists he's not jealous of her crush. When it comes to Neymar's model-girlfriend, Bruna Marquezine, Ms Andrade tries to be gracious. \"I respect her because she makes my idol happy. I'm not a fan of her but I respect her.\"\n\nMs Andrade's mother supports her daughter's obsession. \"I like her happy. When we have to take her somewhere for Neymar, I go with her,\" Marlene Andrade says.\n\nBut she has set ground rules.\n\n\"At school, during breaks, I look at Neymar stuff but I have to work during classes,\" Ms Andrade says. \"My mother said: 'If you don't have a passing grade, Neymar is over.'

The deadly hospital superbug clostridium difficile was shown to be defeated by transplanting fecal bacteria from a healthy person; the results from a successful trial were announced in a New England Journal of Medicine article early last year.\n\nRight now, the challenge for researchers is to figure out, for example, how much bacteria is needed for such a transplant to work, and whether the treatment can be packaged in a kit that can be successfully used at home.\n\n\"If the answer is yes, then you have an oral-care product that could be hugely advantageous over its competitors . . . The toothpaste market worldwide is enormous,\" he said.\n\nDr Turner was speaking to The Business Times towards the end of a three-month visit to Singapore to touch base with his customers, among them the Genome Institute of Singapore under the Agency for Science, Technology And Research (A*Star).\n\nHis company, where he is founder and chief technology officer, is a niche player in the DNA-sequencing machine industry.\n\nThe cost of DNA sequencing, or figuring out the precise order of molecules in DNA, or the building blocks of life, has fallen dramatically since the double-helix structure of DNA was discovered in 1953. The human genome was declared mapped out by 2003, but commercial applications of the data have been slow to come despite researchers' best efforts, Dr Turner said.\n\nIt is only in recent years that \"old opportunities are starting to bear fruit\", he added. For example, a simple blood test based on genomics can now reveal whether a foetus has one of many genomic conditions responsible for Down's syndrome and other birth defects.\n\nGenomics, the science that studies entire DNA sequences, also has applications in late-stage cancer treatment. If mutations found in a patient's cancer are more characteristic of a different type of cancer, treatments designed for the second type of cancer could provide better outcomes, he said.\n\nWith nascent discoveries such as this, biotechnology stocks have been on a roll. The Nasdaq Biotechnology exchange-traded fund, for example, has risen 50 per cent in the last year, and 96 per cent in the last two.\n\nPacBio, while still loss-making since its 2010 initial public offering, recovered in value somewhat in the past year following a deal with Swiss health-care giant Roche.\n\nDr Turner founded PacBio in 2000. Looking back, he said he now realises he made the \"naive technologist's mistake\" of viewing technology as an arms race to find cheaper machines to serve an all-encompassing market.\n\n\"We thought you had to be all things to everybody . . . but it turns out it's a huge marketplace and you only need to have a portion of it to be hugely successful,\" he said.\n\nPacBio is focusing on improving its machines so they can read more DNA at a go, that is, have longer \"read lengths\" and at greater accuracy. Eventually, the market will recognise the difficulties of current mainstream machines being able to see only 80 per cent of what is in genes, he said.\n\nHe will be here again next month to speak at a forum at A*Star's technology transfer arm ETPL.\n\nHe said that Singapore's small biotechnology market need not necessarily be a disadvantage, because larger markets such as the US or China can have higher barriers to entry, such as higher sales costs. Here, an idea that resonates with the local research community can more easily pass the critical point needed for it to be developed exponentially, he said.\n\nSingapore, with its ethnically diverse population, is also an appropriate place to set up a registry of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types for Asians, he said.\n\nHLA typing ensures matches between donors and recipients for bone marrow or stem cell transplants, thus avoiding potentially fatal tissue rejection.\n\nCurrent type registries, biased towards European-Americans and African-Americans, do not serve Asian patients well.\n\n\"I was travelling in India and Singapore and learnt of the frustration with how the American-derived registry is under-serving patients here - you could market a registry created in Singapore to all of Asia.\n\n\"My point is, Singapore might be small, but can be a springboard.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Volatility, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, is near record lows. Some market watchers worry about inflation in the United States, which they fear will trigger an earlier-than-expected interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve. But low volatility suggests that they do not know which way to trade. While the consensus is currently for the first hike of the fed funds rate to take place in the second half of 2015, some people, notably St Louis Federal Reserve president James Bullard, said rates could rise as soon as the first quarter of 2015. This is because core personal consumption expenditures inflation, which hit 1.5 per cent in May, is near the 2 per cent mark the Fed is targeting.\n\nFed Chair Janet Yellen has said recent inflation data is \"noisy\", but also noted that the Fed \"would not willingly see a prolonged period in which inflation persistently runs below our objective or above our objective\". This implies that should evidence mount that inflation is going to be above 2 per cent for a period of time, the Fed will take action to prevent the economy from overheating by raising rates. Conversely, if the US economy does not look like it is picking up, such as now, the Fed is likely to keep the liquidity flowing. Most analysts thus remain confident in the prospects of equities. This faith in stocks is due to a number of reasons.\n\nFirstly, history shows it is not the first rate hike that kills a bull market. Rather, overnight rates have to rise to above 4 per cent before stock markets begin their downturn. As DBS pointed out, it took 17 rate hikes amounting to 425 basis points in the last US bull cycle before stocks began to decline.\n\nSecondly, with cash yielding near zero, investors have no choice but to keep their money in equities. But inflows into equities started just last year and are not near the frenzied levels seen in previous market peaks.\n\nThirdly, while there are signs that inflation is picking up in the US through rising raw materials and unfinished goods costs and rising wages, it is still below the 4 per cent mark above which equity valuations tend to decline. Standard Chartered Private Bank said in a recent presentation that historical S&P 500 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios for inflation in the 2 to 2.9 per cent region are 19.5 times. Current P/E ratios are at 18 times, which makes equities fully valued for inflation in the 3-3.9 per cent range. If inflation is between 4 to 5 per cent, equity valuations drop to 15 times.\n\nDespite many good reasons to stay in equities, there might be hidden geopolitical or market risks investors may not have discounted, including tensions in the South China Sea and spreading conflicts over Iraq or Ukraine - which can cause oil and gas prices to spike. History teaches us that market crashes happen for one reason or another, at unexpected times. Prudent investor will diversify, buy on fundamentals when the market is afraid, and hold cash when everybody is buying.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Of course, we could be fortunate and find it in the first hour, or the first day. But it could take another 12 months,\" he added.\n\nUntil now, the most intensive search had been with a mini-submarine in a zone further north, where pings believed to be from the plane's black box were detected. That area has now been ruled out as the final resting place of MH370. The source of the noises is unknown.\n\nBefore the new underwater search can get underway, the ocean floor, which is up to five kilometres deep, needs to be mapped. Two ships - Fugro Equator and Zhu Kezhen - are currently surveying the area before a contractor begins the intensive undersea probe.\n\nMr Truss said Australia was currently tendering for a company to take control of the search, while Malaysia was set to hire additional equipment such as a towed side scan sonar, a multi-beam echo sounder and a sub bottom profiler for the underwater survey. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

But this may not be the case for our SMEs,\" says JTC CEO Png Cheong Boon.\n\n\"For example, a food manufacturer tends to have its own delivery trucks and warehouse. Therefore, it ends up having to provide services such as delivery and warehousing on top of its core manufacturing and it doesn't enjoy the economies of scale that come along with outsourcing such services to a specialised operator.\n\n\"We encourage companies operating in our space to redesign their processes and consider outsourcing. In that sense, we are trying to use our innovative spaces to support and in some ways accelerate the transformation of our industries.\"\n\nThe future JTC Food Hub in Senoko, for instance, will feature shared integrated cold-room warehouse facilities operated by a third-party logistics service provider, who will in turn offer a full suite of logistics services to tenants.\n\nThis is a challenge for business owners in that they have to relook existing assets or employees, and it requires them to review their business models, acknowledges Mr Png.\n\n\"Our sense is that when companies looking for more space are faced with this kind of growth opportunity, and resources are tight, they tend to be more open to figuring new things out,\" he said.\n\nThe Food Hub (due to be completed by 2017) is not the first of the innovative spaces to be rolled out by JTC, which has in recent years stepped up the development of its built facilities.\n\nThe high-rise multi-tenanted Surface Engineering Hub in Tanjong Kling, for instance, clusters companies to generate economies of scale, synergies and partnership opportunities between the companies. In addition, the firms are able to leverage the centralised wastewater treatment plant, which helps reduce operating costs over time.\n\n\"JTC no longer builds 'plain vanilla factories' as this is a segment well served by private developers. Instead, we are stepping up efforts to plug the market gap by building the next-generation industrial facilities with innovative and productivity-enabling features - which the private sector may not be able to provide,\" said Mr Png.\n\nAs part of JTC' s plans to roll out 16 innovative spaces, the agency is also looking at ways to transform and upgrade the furniture and furniture-related industry, as well as concepts on the drawing board that include plans for a poultry processing plant, a chemicals hub and, in the longer term, a multi-user shipyard.\n\nIn the meantime, JTC is also stepping up its engagement and discussions with various trade associations.\n\n\"Now, we are working more with trade and industry associations to see what are their issues on the ground, what are their land and space needs, and whether there is something JTC can do to help or facilitate,\" said Mr Png.\n\n\"And because associations are more aware of what we are doing and what we can do, they are also a lot more forthcoming in sharing their requirements with us.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

What, we don't know. But in London, they're all going to Chiltern Firehouse and ordering a double helping of bragging rights with fries.\n\nWho would have thought that an old fire station in Marylebone could be such a magnet for celebrities from Kate Moss to Bill Clinton? And that those lucky enough to get a table risk whiplash from all that neck-twisting to catch a glimpse of Davids Beckham and Cameron, Lindsay Lohan, Gerri Halliwell, and other names too hip for us to recognise?\n\nHotelier Andre Balazs certainly knew it when he took over the spot on Chiltern Road and turned it into a hotel and uber-trendy eatery designed along the same stylised lines of his American properties such as New York's Mercer and Hollywood's Chateau Marmont. If you make it pretty, they will come, he must have thought - and he's certainly pulled out all the stops to make this otherwise serious-looking Gothic facade into party central.\n\nWe soon find out that snaring a reservation at Chiltern Firehouse ups your street cred immensely, even if it's only for lunch on a weekday. The stars only come out at night and especially on weekends, although we do manage to spot a Singapore Who's Who - the owner of a designer brands group, luxury hotels and wellness centres. She, in turn, is immediately fawned over by Harry Handelsman, owner of the St Pancras group of hotels.\n\nWith all the buzz about Balazs's celebrity connections that attracts stars Starbucks draws caffeine junkies, and the retrofitted interior that features a restored fire pole and open concept kitchen, it's a wonder that people even pay attention to chef Nuno Mendes's cooking - a smartly curated, genre-less menu that is loosely American with some South American touches.\n\nHe has thus far won dazzling reviews from all the top London critics - which does set one wondering about the criteria used when Simon Rogan's cooking at Fera is more strongly rooted in technique and style. Still, Mendes's pedigree as the hotshot chef of Viajante is amplified in this new arena, and he's certainly got the caloric needs of his guests in mind with his heavy emphasis on greens and controlled portions of carbs and protein.\n\nFlavours are fresh and punchy, if not particularly challenging. But Mendes certainly knows how to throw in a few unexpected twists, such as the way he sticks staid cauliflower florets in a bed of zingy truffle-infused cauliflower cream, topped with crisp fried leaves and what our friendly server describes as dessicated milk and butter crumbs. Light airy baby doughnuts are stuffed with creamy crab mixture that has just a hint of kaffir lime leaf, while marinated compressed cucumber boats are too acidic, overpowering its delicate salmon tartare filling.\n\nA passable Caesar salad offers a bit of textural interest with a garnish of wispy thin dehydrated chicken skin crisps which are delicate crisps of salty fat, but it's easily outdone by an amazingly simple yet perfect composition of heirloom tomatoes at their peak of sweetness, creamy burrata cheese, basil leaves and a drizzle of herb oil.\n\nMushroom pizzette is a satisfying mix of grilled girolle mushrooms and ricotta cheese on a blanket of wilted chard leaves and chewy, doughy pizza crust. Even if you opt for something more carnivorous like a very pink and juicy grilled Iberico pork fillet, you'll still meet your veggie quota with the thick spinach sauce and shower of greens that cover the meat.\n\nIf there's one standout creation it would be Mendes's \"frozen apple pannacotta\" - fragrant shiso leaf granite that looks like a frozen garden on top of which sprouts a grilled meringue \"mushroom\" that you cut into and scoop up a divine mix of silky egg white, frozen pannacotta, apple jelly and apple chunks, freshened with the distinctive sweet green-ness of the shiso ice. This lovely interplay of creamy and icy, mellow and perky is downright good.\n\nOverall, it's the kind of menu that suits a place like this - where style and attitude count as much, if not more, than the food. Mendes puts on a good show, but he's careful not to upstage the real stars. And if that's the kind of meal you're looking for, then step right up behind all the Londoners who are dying for the same.\n\nBy Jaime Ee\n\njaime@sph.com.sg\n\n@JaimeEeBT\n\nChiltern Firehouse, 1 Chiltern Street, Marylebone, London W1U 7PA.\n\nTel: 020-7073-7676.\n\nreservations@chilternfirehouse.com\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Total market cap was up 5.5 per cent from the first quarter, which was in turn up 1.8 per cent from the end of 2013.\n\nYear-to-date, the market value of every share listed on the Singapore Exchange is up 7.5 per cent.\n\nBut the latest quarter ended on a literally tired note with the overnight football matches of the World Cup in Brazil taking some air out of June's markets. The market's combined value was down 0.1 per cent from May.\n\n\"I think markets will remain quiet until after the 2014 World Cup,\" UOB Kay Hian head of research Andrew Chow said.\n\nReversing the trend from previous months, June saw mid-sized to all but the smallest stocks outperforming the blue chips. The large cap-dominated Straits Times Index (STI) slipped 1.2 per cent, or 40.18 points, from May to end June at 3,255.67.\n\nIt was a dismal period for initial public offerings, with only three new listings. Catheter maker QT Vascular, security specialist IPS Securex Holdings and carpet seller SMJ International Holdings added $425.3 million of market cap to the Catalist board.\n\nThe banks have seen some of the largest increases in market cap so far, up 15.8 per cent from a year ago. The value of real estate investment trusts (Reits) is up 21.7 per cent year-on-year, but the sector hit a soft patch in June to slip 1.7 per cent from May.\n\nMergers and acquisitions, a number of which took place among Reits and property developers, have been key in the first half and could continue to feature prominently in the second, CIMB head of research Kenneth Ng said. With the equity market still soft, acquirers with capital are willing to pounce.\n\n\"Companies have money, investors have money,\" Mr Ng said.\n\nValuations in the first half had little help from corporate earnings, which were soft.\n\n\"Falling property margins as ... developers cut prices to sell, in the offshore and marine sector, margins have come down, ... there is indeed a slowdown in Asia, and overseas contributions are lower on a Singapore dollar basis,\" Mr Ng said.\n\nThe analysts nevertheless remained modestly bullish for the second half.\n\nMr Ng expected the STI to hit 3,474.\n\n\"The hope is that volumes will pick up,\" he said. \"The market will be on the lookout for interest listings or stories or corporate actions, so it will be less of market-wide factors per se but more individual companies.\"\n\nDMG head of research Terence Wong, who felt that first-half earnings were mixed but generally in line with expectations, was upbeat on the oil and gas, plantations, offshore and marine and construction sectors.\n\n\"I'm hoping that the liquidity will pick up, and I think it would if the fundamentals continue to improve,\" Mr Wong said. \"A lot of liquidity has already been drained out from small caps.\"\n\nHe had a 3,480 target for the STI.\n\nMr Chow expected the second half to be rangebound \"as investors look to cues for a sustainable rise in earnings amidst a gradual recovery in global GDP\".\n\nThe UOB Kay Hian analyst preferred banks, selective telcos, and Reits that have exposure to growth sectors.\n\n\"I have a year end target of 3,400 for the STI, premised on no major external shock,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In addition, the lifetime claim amount of $300,000 is being lifted, while the policy year claim limit will rise from $70,000 to $100,000.\n\nBut, as widely expected, premiums are set to increase in line with the wider and higher coverage when MediShield Life is rolled out by end-2015. To help Singaporeans cope with the higher premiums, the government will introduce transitional subsidies for the first four years totalling $830 million.\n\nMeanwhile, permanent premium subsidies, ranging from 15-50 per cent, will be introduced to aid lower- to middle-income households based on factors like monthly per capita household income and age. Two- thirds of the population will qualify for these. Permanent residents (PRs) will receive half of the applicable premium subsidies for Singaporeans, but not the transitional subsidies.\n\nSome 450,000 Singaporeans will receive special subsidies of 40-60 per cent under the Pioneer Generation Package, which was announced earlier this year. Everyone in this group will pay less for MediShield Life premiums compared to what they are paying today, while those aged 80 and above this year will have their premiums fully covered through subsidies and Medisave top-ups.\n\nWhen the transitional subsidies are phased out in the fifth year of MediShield Life, lower-income and high-income citizens will pay a maximum increase of $11 and $30 per month in their premiums, respectively, vis-a-vis premiums today.\n\nThe various subsidies and the previously announced one percentage point increase in employer CPF contributions to Medisave from 2015 are expected to help most people fully cover the premiums via Medisave with no out-of-pocket expenses - a key concern raised when the committee was seeking public feedback in recent months.\n\n\"Over time, as costs change, as premiums change, we will make sure that it can be paid out of Medisave and therefore affordability should never be an issue,\" Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told reporters during a working trip to the United States.\n\nThe government has also promised additional support for the needy so that no one drops out of the scheme because of an inability to pay the premiums.\n\nThe committee has also suggested that premiums - which are unlikely to be further revised until 2019 - be distributed more evenly throughout one's lifetime, so that an individual pays more while working and premiums rise less sharply as one ages.\n\n\"We had to strike a balance between additional benefits and premium affordability,\" said Bobby Chin, chairman of the 11-member MLRC and a member of the Council of Presidential Advisers. For instance, while feedback showed some were in favour of reducing deductibles, the committee decided to keep them at current levels to keep premiums affordable.\n\nThe compulsory universal health insurance scheme will bring in the 7 per cent of Singaporeans currently not insured under MediShield (including those who may have dropped out along the way) and will also protect those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nIn the case of the latter, the government will bear 75 per cent of the cost of bringing in Singaporeans and PRs with pre-existing conditions, estimated at $850 million over the first five years. The balance 25 per cent will be shouldered between individuals with pre-existing conditions (who will pay an additional 30 per cent of the standard premium for the first 10 years) to take into account their higher risks, and all other Singaporeans who will pay 3 per cent more of existing MediShield premiums to support bringing everyone in\n\nLife Insurance Association (LIA) Singapore president Khoo Kah Siang yesterday stressed policyholders would see \"minimal impact\" on the top-up portion of their Integrated Shield Plans (IP). Some 60 per cent of Singaporeans have signed up for IPs, which allow policyholders additional coverage for Class A/B1 wards or even private hospitals. \"IP insurers will continue to monitor and manage the impact of medical inflation to ensure the IPs remain competitively priced,\" Dr Khoo added. LIA represents five IP insurers.\n\nThe committee recommended the government should work with the insurance industry to develop a standardised IP targeted at Class B1 level, giving the option of enhanced coverage on top of the basic MediShield Life plan, and that it should improve the existing regulatory and accountability framework for IP insurers. It also mooted the idea of enabling risk-loading for IPs, so IP insurers can manage those with pre-existing conditions differently.\n\nAnother recommendation is to offer enhanced incentives to firms willing to restructure their individual medical benefit schemes into portable schemes that ride on MediShield Life. Such government incentives would be \"crucial\" to help companies with the added costs, highlighted Singapore National Employers Federation executive director Koh Juan Kiat.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It found that the police response was effective on the whole, but suffered from several lapses.\n\nAt the same time, the COI took pains to highlight \"what, in its estimation, this riot was not about\" - racial or ethnic issues, and foreign workers' dissatisfaction over conditions in Singapore. \"Anecdotal complaints, however valid, do not amount to evidence of systemic mistreatment,\" said the report.\n\n\"Nearly every foreign worker who the COI spoke to testified emphatically that they were happy with their jobs and living quarters in Singapore and condemned the riot.\"\n\nNevertheless, \"while the COI is satisfied that foreign workers' employment and living conditions were not the cause of this riot, this is not to say that a riot may never occur on this basis,\" said the four-member committee.\n\n\"There is no doubt that there are some foreign workers here who face real difficulties in their employment or living situation, especially those employed by errant firms who might withhold their salaries, not maintain the standards of their accommodation, or refuse workers warranted medical leave.\"\n\nAs such, the COI \"observed\" several ways to improve the lives of foreign workers, and highlighted common problems that some workers face. For instance, it acknowledged that there are still workers who are hesitant and unsure of their rights when making salary or workplace injury claims.\n\nThe committee also flagged high foreign employment agency fees which put workers into heavy debt.\n\nWhile the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) cannot regulate the fees charged by agents registered overseas, the COI said that MOM could consider working with employer associations to encourage annual increments as a norm in the industry, since that would give workers greater hope of overcoming their debt more quickly.\n\nThe COI added that accommodation facilities here - although already \"ranked well\" in the world - can be improved to \"significantly better workers' bare lives\".\n\nWhile such steps will certainly push up already-rising business costs, UOB economist Francis Tan told The Business Times that companies shouldn't take such suggestions negatively: \"Don't just look at the short term. (Improving foreign workers' conditions means) you'd be insuring yourself against unhappiness later on, and the cost of discontent could actually hurt you - but you just don't know it because you can't calculate it.\"\n\nObservers had earlier told BT that the Little India riot, if repeated, could shake business confidence in Singapore.\n\nWhen Parliament sits next Monday, both the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and MOM will provide the government's response to the COI report, which included recommendations to reduce any future risk of such incidents in Singapore.\n\nGiving its take on the Singapore Police Force's (SPF) response on the night of Dec 8, the COI said that it found \"several lapses\" in police actions, but stressed that overall, the SPF responded to the riot \"relatively swiftly and efficiently\".\n\nThe committee pointed to SPF's decision to hold officers' positions and not arrest rioters while awaiting the arrival of the Special Operations Command (SOC). \"This decision should have been re-evaluated when the SOC was late in arriving. Holding positions at the two ends of the riot area was inadequate to prevent the free movement of rioters in and out of the area through other routes, and the perceived inaction could have emboldened the rioters,\" said the COI.\n\nIt believes there were sufficient officers to take action, had they been marshalled and directed to do so.\n\nIn addition to its findings on the causes of last year's riot, the committee also offered eight recommendations to the government. These included strengthening the Home Team by increasing manpower resources, enhancing the safety of congregation areas with stricter enforcement against public drunkenness, and reducing congestion at congregation sites by making services and amenities available elsewhere.\n\nIn a letter thanking COI chairman and former Supreme Court Judge, G Pannir Selvam, Deputy Prime Minister and Home Affairs Minister Teo Chee Hean said that the report \"makes several important recommendations and observations to improve the management of such incidents and to prevent their recurrence\".\n\nThe other members were former commissioner of Police Tee Tua Ba, former president of the Singapore National Trades Union Congress John De Payva, and managing director of SME Care and chairman of the West Coast Citizens' Consultative Committee Andrew Chua Thiam Chwee.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For it was over two casual weekend brunches that the Sydney-born chef first met Benjamin Lee and Louise Tong-Davies, whom he would eventually partner with to launch his first solo restaurant venture, The Lokal. Ms Tong-Davies is an accountant by training and organises supper club, Brunch & Co, while Mr Lee also owns three-year-old sandwich shop Sarnies.\n\nOpened two weeks ago, the 55-seater The Lokal is already finding a fast following for its comfort food served in a cosy, cafe setting - a far cry from the large, landmark restaurants Mr Farr built his career on.\n\nPreviously on the founding team of Tetsuya's in Australia, the 50-year-old has also spent time at Mezzo by veteran British designer-cum-restaurateur Sir Terence Conran. In the 700-seater London megalith - large by UK's dining standards then - Mr Farr was part of a team of 120 chefs and over 1,000 staff. He later moved to Hong Kong as part of the Cafe Deco Group, which owns establishments such as the Peak Cafe and Cafe Deco atop the Peak, along with a network of airport eateries.\n\nFive years ago, he relocated to Singapore to head the kitchen at Culina in Dempsey. Though there are undeniable benefits to being part of a bigger outfit - such as a larger finance and human resources support network, the availability of storage space for bulk orders and the buzz of finishing an incredibly hectic meal service - being in a smaller outfit has its perks too.\n\n\"The kitchen is more controllable, more personable, and you get much more freedom. They say that too many cooks spoil the broth, and that can be very true,\" says Mr Farr. He currently leads a lean kitchen team of four at The Lokal, but he hopes to eventually double that number when the dinner menu is launched next month.\n\nOn its current menu are offerings such as granola and yogurt for breakfast and burgers, sandwiches and salads for lunch, but dinners will comprise stodgier fare such as Mr Farr's take on Kentucky Fried Chicken made with buttermilk-brined local kampung chicken and a lobster mac and cheese. \"I prefer working in an environment where everyone feels like family. When you work so closely and know one another's idiosyncrasies, you no longer feel like an employer, but you're like a father, uncle or brother to your staff.\"\n\nThis means taking care of even the tiniest of details, such as what his staff will have for lunch. Recalling how the lack of staff meal provisions at his previous workplaces meant cooks would sometimes nick leftovers sent back to the kitchen by diners - only to have their tips docked if they were caught - Mr Farr says staff meals are instead viewed as an important part of team-building at The Lokal. \"It's a chance for our chefs to try their own cooking, which helps them better explain the menu to our diners - and it's a time for us to have an informal meeting to get feedback from everyone on the team,\" he explains.\n\nA smaller, close-knit team also means he can keep a closer eye on everything that passes through the kitchen, Mr Farr adds. \"When you're a big and busy restaurant, there is a temptation to take short cuts, but that's something I won't tolerate.\"\n\nEverything is made from scratch as far as possible at The Lokal, from its ketchup made of fermented tomato relish and bourbon to its house-churned ricotta cheese. \"I want to be a place that even chefs want to come to and eat at - on their days off.\"\n\nThough starting a venture of his own was something he was in talks with several times, \"nothing ever felt right until now\", says Mr Farr. Once things are smoothly running at The Lokal, he hopes to expand by putting up his homemade products for retail, and eventually finding a central kitchen space in which they can be produced.\n\n\"I've reached a stage in my career where I just want to keep things simple, and let the produce speak for itself.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Sales of Boeing Co's 777 and 747-8 cargo aircraft have stalled as carriers such as British Airways and FedEx Corp, operator of the world's largest cargo airline, shift less-urgent shipments to the cargo holds of Boeing 777 jetliners.\n\nBoeing's largest twin-engine model is leading the influx of aircraft with spacious cargo bays that are squeezing out older freighters and damping demand for new planes. The global fleet of wide-body passenger jets is projected to grow 8 per cent this year, adding to a capacity glut as the fuel-efficient 777 and other long-range models are manufactured in record numbers.\n\n\"I haven't sold a wide-body freighter in four years,\" said Glen Langdon, president of Langdon Asset Management Inc, a San Francisco firm with extensive experience selling used 747s and other large commercial jets. \"I have sold wide-body passenger aircraft, including 777s. I was stunned and amazed by just how much capacity there is below deck.\"\n\nThe cargo hold on a 777-300ER is so roomy that a passenger airline can hold 7,120 cubic feet of freight - 25 per cent more than a four-engine 747-8 jumbo can take beneath its cabin. A 777 also can carry as many as 386 people.\n\n\"These are immensely capable aeroplanes,\" Robert Mann, a former airline executive who heads consultant R.W. Mann & Co, based in Port Washington, New York, said on June 19. \"Once you have a network of them, you can start providing an in-house cargo service without flying an all-cargo aeroplane.\"\n\nBoeing has sold five dedicated freighters this year, four of the 777F variant and one based on the 747-8 jumbo. The 777F is its current top-selling freighter, at 134. Airbus Group NV has garnered no orders for the A330-200 freighter this year, six in 2013 against 18 cancellations, and just 38 since introducing the plane in 2007, according to its website.\n\nBoeing, the world's largest planemaker, needs both its major freighter offerings to flourish if the Chicago-based company is to avoid production cuts that could hurt revenue, said Yair Reiner, a New York-based aerospace analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. He rates Boeing shares market perform.\n\nOf 51 unfilled orders for the 747-8, 21 are for the freighter variant, according to Boeing's website. That's a backlog of about three years after the company cut output twice last year to 1.5 a month due to slow sales. The 747-8F and 777F are among its priciest models, listing for US$357.5 million and US$300.5 million.\n\nPassenger jets such as the 777, 787 Dreamliner and A330 are all being produced at record rates, and the glut of big aircraft will only get worse when the A350, Airbus's first twin-engine comparable in size to the 777, begins service later this year.\n\nThe shift to so-called belly cargo has accelerated since oil prices topped US$100 a barrel and the global recession in 2008 sent shocks through the airfreight market, according to data compiled by the International Air Transport Association trade group.\n\nWith volumes squeezed, cargo haulers have parked older, four-engine freighters, such as Boeing's 747-400 jumbos, according to Ascend data compiled by Bloomberg Industries.\n\nDelta Air Lines Inc and British Airways are among the carriers that have grounded dedicated cargo fleets in recent years as low interest rates and smaller consumer electronics sap demand for overnight shipping. Even Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx is shifting parcels that aren't time sensitive to \"these prolific underbellies\" from its own jets, FedEx Ground president Henry Maier said on a March conference call.\n\nWhile main-deck freighters hold several advantages over passenger models, including larger doors and the flexibility to fly during hours that travellers would shun, they \"operate at higher unit costs as cargo needs to pay for the full operation of the plane\", David Vernon, a New York-based analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co, wrote in a June 17 report.\n\nAtlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc, which manages the largest fleet of 747 freighters, questions the idea of passenger airlines being able to displace cargo-only operators.\n\n\"I'm not saying that belly's not viable or not a good economic proposition for shippers - it is,\" said William Flynn, chief executive officer of the Purchase, New York-based company. \"This hypothesis that all this belly capacity has come in and it's going to disintermediate or fundamentally change the equation for main deck, I think, is simply overstated.\"\n\nPure freighters will be vital on busy cargo routes linking Chinese manufacturers with US and European consumers, he said. \"Freight moves through hubs.\"\n\nThe market share for international air cargo carried on main-deck freighters, traditionally split evenly with belly cargo, \"is around 40 per cent, and one could see it slipping to 30 per cent\", said Perry Flint, a spokesman for Montreal-based International Air Transport Association, which projected the 8 per cent growth in the wide-body fleet. \"But there will always be a need for freighters.\"\n\nMr Flynn said the amount of freight shifted to belly cargo is being overcounted and main-deck air cargo is still about 60 per cent of the market. Analysts aren't fully accounting for cargo lost to passenger luggage, weight limits or inconvenience of long-range jets bypassing shipping hubs, he said.\n\nBoeing has tempered its forecasts since the 2008 recession and now sees annual cargo-market growth of about 5 per cent, down from more than 6 per cent, marketing vice-president Randy Tinseth said. That should drive a need for about 850 new planes through 2032, valued at US$240 billion, according to the company's 2013 market outlook.\n\n\"Over a prolonged period of cargo growth, I think the demand is going to come back, and that's going to mean good things for both the 777 freighter and the 747-8 freighter,\" Mr Tinseth said.\n\nBoeing is counting on a recovery in global demand to boost 777 freighter orders to bridge a gap in sales until an overhauled passenger version of the 777 is introduced in 2020, Joseph Nadol, a New York-based JPMorgan Chase & Co analyst, wrote in a June 20 research report.\n\nWhile the 777 freighter is \"an attractive offering\", Boeing has garnered only 13 sales since orders peaked in 2011 at 42, said Mr Nadol, who rates the company's shares overweight. \"The trend looks poor, but we consider the freighter an important part of the bridge, as does Boeing.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Port officials know that by the time the Panama Canal opens in 2016, an even newer, larger fleet of cargo ships will be plying the oceans and will be so big they will not be able to squeeze through even the wider channel.\n\nSo Tacoma, Seattle and other ports are spending billions to be ready to receive the ships and keep themselves competitive in the overall scramble for foreign trade.\n\n\"The ships continue to get bigger, the cranes need to get bigger, and the docks need to be able to handle them,\" said Trevor Thornsley, senior project manager for the Port of Tacoma, as he stood along the jagged rebar and broken concrete of a US$22 million renovation to shore up the port's Pier 3.\n\nThe work in Tacoma, a major port in this state that likes to call itself the most trade-dependent in the nation, is among dozens of projects being completed in port cities across the United States in response to major changes in the world of container imports from Asia.\n\n\"Everybody in the supply chain from the manufacturer to the end consumer - that entire supply chain is changing,\" said Tay Yoshitani, chief executive of the Port of Seattle. \"The port industry is trying to make adjustments.\"\n\nTraditionally, America's West Coast ports have been the gateway to the rest of the country for the growing supply of goods from China and Hong Kong.\n\nThe ports in Tacoma, Seattle, Oakland, Los Angeles, Long Beach and elsewhere offer much shorter sailing times than Gulf Coast and East Coast ports. But for shippers of some goods, the web of logistics, including trucks and railroads, ends up being less expensive if they go through the Panama Canal.\n\nEven though the West Coast ports are viewing the project to widen the Panama Canal as a major threat, it may not be their biggest challenge, said John Martin, who works as an economic consultant for several ports.\n\nMost imminently, officials at the West Coast ports are concerned about negotiations underway for a union contract, which expires tomorrow and affects nearly 20,000 dockworkers at 29 ports. In 2002, during contract negotiations, talks broke down and resulted in a bitter battle that shut down shipping along the West Coast for 10 days and sent cargo ships to other ports of call, some of them permanently.\n\nCraig Merrilees, a spokesman for the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, said that contract talks were positive and on track. John Wolfe, the chief executive of the Port of Tacoma, said that while port officials did not have a role in the talks, he, too, was optimistic.\n\nBesides the union concerns, ports are bracing for an onslaught of changes in the shipping world.\n\nWhile the widened Panama Canal will allow an all-water route for big ships to the East Coast, the project - originally scheduled to open this year - has been plagued with construction delays. And the authorities have yet to announce toll charges. In the end, it might be too expensive for some ships to use.\n\nIt is also possible that railroads that move goods from West Coast ports could lower fees to make it more economical for ships to avoid the Panama Canal route.\n\n\"The uncertainty as to what's going to happen with rates is huge,\" said Mr Martin, the consultant.\n\nAt the same time, sailing patterns may shift as Asian manufacturing continues to move from China to countries to the south, like Singapore and Vietnam, which are actually closer by sea to East Coast ports through the Suez Canal than to West Coast ports across the Pacific.\n\nA new competitive threat has emerged 800 km north of the US border with Canada. Tacoma and Seattle are losing market share to the Port of Prince Rupert in British Columbia, just six years old and already doing brisk business with goods headed for the Midwest United States.\n\nFor trade with China, Prince Rupert's appeal is proximity. Prince Rupert is two to three days closer than the western coast of the United States, helping ships cut fuel costs.\n\nHere at the Port of Tacoma, the biggest threat in the past has been the port just 48 km away in Seattle. The two ports have fought back and forth for decades over shipping business. But the new competition from Canada and elsewhere has brought an unusual alliance.\n\nThis year, the two ports for the first time sought permission from the Federal Maritime Commission to share information on operations and rates without violating federal antitrust laws. The ports now are coordinating lobbying tactics as well as construction projects to make sure they're not duplicating efforts, officials said, and are researching other ways to cooperate.\n\nIn Seattle, the port's facilities already have undergone US$1.2 billion in upgrades through 2012 and plans have been approved for an additional US$5 million to upgrade Terminal 5 to get ready for big ships. Tacoma's Pier 3 project will make it sturdy enough to handle the monster cranes needed to reach across wide berths and unload the big ships.\n\nThe expenditures are a gamble. No one knows for sure whether enough of the big ships will come to Seattle and Tacoma to offset the investments in the ports. But Steve Sewell, economic development director for Washington state's maritime industry, said the preparations were worth it. \"You have to make some investments,\" he said, \"and take some risks.\" - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Carnival raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast to US$1.60 to US$1.75 per share from US$1.50-US$1.70.\n\nNet income rose to US$106 million, or 14 US cents per share, in the second quarter ended May 31, from US$41 million, or five US cents per share, a year earlier.

Hence, smaller companies have been popping up to try and fill the gap for niche event organisers who don't have the volume to list their shows on Sistic.\n\nOne of these is EventNook, which was started by Singapore PR Kyaw Lin Oo who used to be a software engineer. In early 2011, he thought of the idea for EventNook, when one of his customers requested for software that would help with event planning and guest registration.\n\n\"They said they needed a good registration software to collect guest information because they previously screwed up their events over this,\" explains the Myanmar-born 36-year-old.\n\nSo that was when he started developing a software that eventually materialised into EventNook - a website which acts as a platform for the man in the street to easily set up an event website, collect guest registration details, disseminate information to attendees, and even sell tickets.\n\n\"We are like Sistic, but for smaller events. Say if you want about 100 people in a cafe or bar, Sistic won't be suitable because it charges things like administration fee, and creating or launching the event takes some time,\" explains Mr Kyaw.\n\nEventNook went 'live' just last year, and for now, there's no charge for creating an event on the page if it is free. If the event is ticketed, then EventNook takes a cut of 2.5 per cent of ticket sales plus 30 cents per attendee, not including transaction fees. Right now, they have about 50 events happening concurrently every day, and Mr Kyaw says this number is consistently increasing.\n\nTheir events can range from small concerts at bars, private birthday parties, or even corporate dinners where additional guests and individual dietary information is has to be collected. In fact, that is one function that sets EventNook apart from its competitors, and is in line with their focus which is more on making the registration and ticket-buying process easier - organisers can customise registration forms to collect specific relevant information they need from guests.\n\nThis vision is a little different from that of their competitor - Japanese company Peatix - which wants to create a holistic mobile solution for event organisers from the planning phase all the way to the execution stage. Peatix was set up in Tokyo in 2011 by four partners, but it onlzy launched officially in Singapore last year. Right now, it has over 200 events going on in Singapore at any one time.\n\nSays one of Peatix's co-founders, Emi Takemura: \"We come from Amazon.com so we've been trained in the e-commerce space for quite some time, and we wanted a way to support the creative industry so we felt event space is great for that.\"\n\n\"Everybody in creative space needs to do events to get attention or make ends meet and we would like to make the technology accessible so that anyone with great ideas can run events without having to worry about how to build a webpage,\" adds Ms Takemura.\n\nTheir web-based platform performs similar functions to that of EventNook, except that they also have an app that allows the event organisers to control certain aspects of their event directly from their smartphone.\n\nThey too do not charge for use of their platform to organise free events, but instead take a cut of 2.9 per cent of ticket sales plus 99 cents per attendee for ticketed events, inclusive of all transaction fees.\n\nAccording to Ms Takemura, the company is currently focusing on mobile technology, and hopes to improve their app to make the event-planning a seamless process that can easily be carried out by any layman via a smartphone or tablet. She says: \"We haven't scratched the surface of what we can do. We haven't really pushed the envelope in terms of being able to completely run events on mobile phones or tablets yet, so we're working on that. We want eventually for people to want to come to Peatix to create pages, get connected with other organisers, or even source for ideas and inspiration.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It announced ambitions to be Singapore's fourth full-fledged telco and offer future subscribers unlimited mobile data bundles - the very concept that larger players have been trying to phase out.\n\nBut while buffet data pricing might set off warning signals for the great telco triumvirate of SingTel, StarHub and M1, what they should be more worried about is the business model that MyRepublic might bring to the mobile sector.\n\nIf regulation and funding go according to plan, MyRepublic might just make for a lean, hungry rival vying for a share of the mobile pie.\n\n\"The incumbents are stuck in a cost structure - they have a lot of people, a lot of expensive systems and legacy technology,\" Malcolm Rodrigues, MyRepublic's chief executive officer, told The Business Times this week.\n\nMyRepublic, he believes, will be able to build and operate infrastructure at a fraction of the cost of the established players'. The firm will need $300 million on its first year, which might (or might not) cover spectrum costs, depending on how much it eventually ends up being priced.\n\nFor funding, it is looking for an overseas and a local partner to come in for equity in the mobile venture, on top of what it might raise from financial institutions - probably through a mix of debt and equity. At the same time, it is counting on being able to avoid the ungainliness of being a listed firm, hobbled by quarterly expectations and dividend payout ratios.\n\nEven on the product front, MyRepublic wants to steer clear of the plethora of price plans that operators currently offer to keep the billing system cost down.\n\n\"Just as we've done on the fixed side, we can take a lot of the savings and redirect it to the network experience,\" Mr Rodrigues said.\n\nAlready, the company is part of a pack of new players that have started upsetting the fixed broadband apple cart of larger counterparts. Since smaller service providers began making play for the market, the established players have seen falls in either overall broadband revenue or the segment's average revenue per user.\n\nAt the start of the year, MyRepublic twisted the knife further, offering consumers a one gigabit per second fibre broadband connection for a staggeringly low $49.99 a month.\n\nNow, it wants to take the same bootstrapping approach to the mobile sector and offer it unlimited data bundling. No price point has been decided but Mr Rodrigues indicated that the firm might take its cue from the neighbourhood of $50 that most people are comfortable paying for fixed broadband.\n\nThe stakes are higher in the mobile market, however. The large telcos stopped offering virtually unlimited data to new customers for a good reason, analysts said. \"MyRepublic might run into the same problem where they get the wrong type of customers - people who will hog their bandwidth,\" OCBC Investment Research's Carey Wong noted.\n\nWhile MyRepublic plans to build a network that is scalable in response to more traffic, how long this can be kept up as mobile data usage increases is unclear, especially if the firm offers unlimited data indefinitely.\n\nAlso, there is the question of whether the Big Three will retaliate and bring back unlimited data, but this is largely academic. \"Not a snowball's chance in hell,\" was what an industry player told BT.\n\nIn this respect, the big telcos might either be unable or unwilling - the former because so much money has already been spent, or the latter because their pockets are deep enough for them to wait out a new rival.\n\nAt the same time, these conjectures are ahead of themselves. Just as the stakes are higher in mobile, so are the walls.\n\n\"It might be compelling that they can add wireless to fixed now where they have done pretty well so far. The difference though is that broadband was a government-led initiative with minimal capex upfront for new players,\" Nomura Equity Research's Sachin Gupta noted. \"Wireless will be different, spectrum will be easier, but the rest will be expensive.\"\n\nFor MyRepublic to be the kind of contender that it wants to be, some very specific conditions have to be fulfilled. It has to get the amount of spectrum that it needs, for one thing.\n\nIt also has to convince the regulators to support a national roaming agreement which allows MyRepublic customers to roam onto a rival telco's network in areas where the former has no coverage yet here. This will give MyRepublic time to match its rivals' level of coverage, which could take at least three years.\n\nGetting these things in place will be a feat, but if the way is paved for MyRepublic's entry - or that of any fourth player that is leaner and hungrier than the incumbents - the Big Three might just have to shed some weight.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He talks to Jaime Ee about the pressures of living up to high expectations\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 27, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIF Simon Rogan looks a bit ill at ease, it's not without good reason. His is the wary stance of one who's been put through the wringer by the British press who thrust him in the limelight for taking over Gordon Ramsay's restaurant at the venerable Claridge's, and systematically took him down with one withering review after another within the first week of the locavore-inspired Fera's opening.\n\nWhen we meet him in the tastefully pared-down dining room in the historic hotel in Mayfair, he has just returned from L'Enclume, his two Michelin-starred flagship in Cartmel - a five-hour drive from London to the Lake District. It was his first trip after working non-stop for six straight weeks since Fera's opening, serving lunch and dinner seven days a week in keeping with the hotel's 24/7 operations.\n\nWith Fera, L'Enclume and The French in Manchester under his wing, there is no free time for the chef who has to grapple with whingeing reviewers, fine-tune his signature multi-course tasting menus to suit time-starved fund managers, and turn in a sound profit at the same time.\n\nYou can't blame him for being disappointed with the critics' lukewarm reception to Fera, after all his hard work. \"I half expected it,\" he says. \"I think they just wanted to hate it.\" It's perhaps a quirk of local critics to be 'anti-establishment', favouring edgy upstarts over big-budget orchestrations such as the Claridge's. Considering that he earned indie cred with L'Enclume - which was voted best restaurant in the UK in the 2014 Good Food Guide - and his popular two-year pop-up Roganic in Marylebone, the shiny \"corporate\" surroundings in the Claridge's was perhaps interpreted as him \"selling out\".\n\nBut he had good reason for taking up the gig, when Ramsay pulled out of Claridge's after 12 years, reportedly because he was unable to agree with the hotel's management over the lease renewal. The hotel, in turn, courted Rogan and everything fell into place. \"I always wanted to come back to London after Roganic,\" says the amiable Rogan, who practically pioneered the locavore movement by serving only ingredients found in and around Cumbria, most of which are grown on his own farm or reared by hand-picked farmers. \"It was just about finding the right place.\"\n\nIt was also about the cost. \"Opening a standalone would have cost \u00a31 million - and would I have a dining room like this? Impossible.\"\n\nHe knew the partnership with Claridge's would work because he'd already had success with The French, which is housed in Manchester's Midland Hotel - also a historic property. \"It was my relationship with Q Hotels (which owns the Midland) that made me see how, if I wanted to come back to London, I needed to be with a hotel.\"\n\nUnlike L'Enclume - where he has diners \"in my hand for the whole night\" because people who make the trip typically stay overnight or, at least, as long as it takes to enjoy the theatrical experience of 20 or so artfully arranged courses - Fera is like its city cousin. Impatient, short of time, and in no mood to have business discussions interrupted 17 times by someone explaining the next course. The idea, then, is to retain the DNA of L'Enclume, but tailored to fit the clientele.\n\n\"It's a different repertoire, but similar in style,\" explains Rogan. \"It's more urban - with the same ethos, same principles, but a different way of delivery.\"\n\nBut more important for the L'Enclume fan, Fera is a godsend for foreign visitors with limited time who can't make the long trip upcountry. Of course, you miss the genteel surroundings and quaint village appeal of Cartmel. And the produce that didn't have to spend a few hours on the truck to the capital city. But in London you have Rogan in the kitchen (at least for now) - applying his magic touch to the specially grown and sourced produce that supplies all three restaurants (\"In about a year, we'll be self-sufficient\", he says of his farm operations).\n\nAt Fera, he is not purely locavore, in deference to a city clientele who would demand truffles in the right season. Although his ingredient net is cast wider in London, his food is simpler than before, more streamlined, with a lot more focus on enhancing the purity of flavours.\n\n\"It's still technical but simplicity is perfection and that's dictating our progression,\" he explains. Given that he owns his own farm and works exclusively with a neighbouring farmer who rears hoggetts (sheep), pigs and chickens (\"next year we'll have our own cows\"), he's able to dictate the quality of what comes out of them. \"Our ingredients are so good that our menus practically write themselves - there's nothing we can buy that is anywhere near as good as what we can grow ourselves\".\n\nIt's not a false boast. You can taste it in the puffed barley cracker filled with smokey cubes of eel and covered in ox daisy petals; a crunchy tempura-crusted ball bursting with rich, warm rabbit stew and a swipe of green lovage sauce; diced sea-kissed scallops resting with sweetest fresh peas in languid buttermilk sauce; duck heart cut into teensy dices enveloped in a pool of cheesey potato foam - and we're not even finished with the snacks yet.\n\nThere's also delicate briny lobster paired with sweet pickled golden beetroot, pleasantly bitter sauce of dittander herb and an addictive skinny shellfish keropok-like cracker. And like an edible garden show-and-tell, Rogan pulls together a heavenly and amazingly complicated salad of crispy roasted kale and broccoli, a shower of leaves and flowers, sunflower seeds and truffle shavings all piled onto a base of rich truffle custard. Want to turn vegetarian? Easy.\n\nAlthough you'll be tempted by the dry-aged hoggett that reminds you of what good lamb can taste like - here it's dressed with cucumber strips that counter the saltiness of the blackberry sauce.\n\nRogan doesn't shy away from the fact that there have been teething problems from the start with staffing issues and getting used to the fast pace of London diners. But he's heartened by the enthusiastic response of the diners themselves, if not the critics who \"say we're expensive and it takes too long to eat here\". With tasting menus priced at \u00a385 (S$180) and \u00a3105, it's a bargain by Singapore standards.\n\nHe makes no bones about the fact that he's under pressure to make sure Fera is a financial success, but he's also confident that \"we've got a good product and I'm determined to make it one of the best places in London\". Despite the \"unfair, inaccurate\" comments - possibly fuelled by perceived arrogance by readers after a magazine misquoted him as saying he was targeting three Michelin stars when in reality he was merely expressing every chef's dream - Rogan has no regrets taking on the hot seat at Claridge's. But openings \"are not the best of times, it takes a while to develop\". And now that he's got the reviews out of the way, \"we'll just keep our head down and work harder\" to please the guests who are already loving the food despite the reviews.\n\n\"But - I've got to earn my money somehow, it would be wrong if it was easy!\" he laughs. \"It's a big job, but this is the place to be and a lot of chefs would give their right arm to be in my shoes. We'll get there - I'm ready for the challenge.\"\n\nMichelin guide, are you listening?\n\nFera at Claridge's, Brook Street, Mayfair, London W1K 4HR,\n\ntel: (0)20 7107 8888 Email:\n\nreservations@feraatclaridges.co.uk\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This came as the group's revenue close to tripled to US$11.9 million from US$4.4 million in FY2012.\n\nAs at June 26, the company had an issued and paid-up share capital of close to S$18.2 million, divided into 344.5 million shares.\n\nSpackman said in its preliminary offer document that its two film production subsidiaries are behind some of Korea's most commercially successful theatrical firms in the past seven years.

Alongside the National Football League, Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association and National Hockey League, it has changed North America's Big Four into the Fab Five.\n\nOften seen as the outsider looking in, a niche sport craving mainstream status, soccer has muscled its way into the day-to-day sporting discussion as an engrossing tournament in Brazil pulls in more-and-more soccer converts by the day.\n\nA record 25 million viewers tuned into to watch the US take on Portugal in the group stage and with the Americans preparing to face Belgium on Tuesday for a place in the quarter-finals, that mark is almost certain to be smashed.\n\nBut not all Americans have joined the World Cup party. While President Barack Obama was pictured leading the cheers from Air Force One, conservative political commentator Ann Coulter was warning that \"any growing interest in soccer can only be a sign of the nation's moral decay\". Ms Coulter's spin on the beautiful game generated predictable outrage, a few laughs and a brief social media firestorm. But it is clear that American appetite for all things soccer is growing.\n\nOn the pitch, the US men have qualified for seven consecutive World Cups while the women are the world's top ranked team. At the grassroots level soccer has always been popular in the US with close to four million young boys and girls playing in leagues from Maine to New Mexico.\n\nIn an opinion piece written for CNN, Ed Foster-Simeon, president and CEO at US Soccer Foundation, responded to Ms Coulter's comments by pointing out that soccer is the third largest participation sport in the country and the team sport with the highest growth rate over the past decade.\n\nAccording to the US Soccer Federation, total attendance at soccer matches in 2013 exceeded 10 million. Domestic leagues are also experiencing growth with Major League Soccer (MLS) continuing robust expansion by adding teams in Orlando, New York and Atlanta - with plans for another in Miami.\n\nIn May, MLS announced a landmark television rights deal after signing an eight-year agreement with ESPN, FOX Sports and Univision Deportes that will, according to media reports, pour US$720 million into league coffers.\n\nAlthough Americans are currently caught in the grip of World Cup fever it is important not to lose perspective of soccer's place in the US. Major League Baseball attendance last season was close to 75 million and that many will be expected through the turnstiles again this year. And while 25 million set a new benchmark for World Cup viewership in the US the number was dwarfed by the 111.5 million who watched this year's Super Bowl. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Mr Nocentini doesn't mind if his new restaurant-bar project doesn't quite ring a bell as the other brands on his resume, he thinks it is just a matter of time before it does. \"We are setting up a big brand name. This is just the first one, but it doesn't mean we'll be small,\" winks the gregarious 28-year-old Italian. Set to open next month, the 78-seater Foc - which means \"fire\" in the Catalan language - will serve up traditional Catalan and Mediterranean cuisine in a menu presided over by Mr Nocentini, who is its new restaurant and bar manager, former Foodbar Dada head chef Jordi Noguera and Catalan chef Nandu Jubany of one-Michelin star restaurant Can Jubany, outside of Barcelona.\n\nMr Jubany oversees eight other restaurants across Spain, and will fly to Singapore five to six times a year to consult on his first overseas venture. Mr Noguera and Mr Jubany are from nearby hometowns and were trained by the same mentor, Spanish chef Carles Gaig. After being approached by a group of local investors to head Foc, Mr Noguera tapped Mr Nocentini's experience and expertise to get the project up and running. It was a fresh challenge that he didn't hesitate to take on, says Mr Nocentini: \"You always need a bit of a challenge, it makes you feel alive. Furthermore, Jordi is a close friend and it's a pleasure to start something with someone I know well.\"\n\nThe Tuscany native is by now no stranger to starting anew. An interpretation and translation graduate from the University of Pisa, he moved to Spain to turn his passion for his part-time bartending gigs into his full-time profession after graduation. He left Barcelona for Singapore in 2012 to launch Catalunya together with a crew that comprised largely former elBulli staff.\n\nWhen the restaurant opened a Hong Kong offshoot last March, Mr Nocentini also oversaw the beverage programme there. Of his departure from the group in May, he says: \"It will always be like my little baby. But there's nothing like being able to leave a successful restaurant to start a new venture from scratch, knowing that it will continue to do well.\" Spanish bartender Adrian Batlle replaces him as Catalunya's bar manager. \"After working in the field for awhile, you start to know yourself and understand how you want to work. And for me, it was 'the smaller the better',\" Mr Nocentini adds.\n\n\"I like being part of the core team and being involved in the whole process of creating something, when you are constantly brainstorming, not sleeping, sketching new ideas down all the time - that's awesome. That's the most fun part.\" Acknowledging the inevitable comparison, Mr Nocentini points out that tapas and cocktails at Foc will be \"completely different\" from Catalunya's.\n\nWhile the food menu will boast innovative creations, Mr Noguera says the beverage list will have a strong focus on boutique and craft products. From a handpicked selection of teas to coffees made from a house blend customised by a local coffee roastery, expect close attention to detail throughout, Mr Nocentini assures. Spanish wines - including uncommon labels sourced from boutique wineries - will take up 90 per cent of the wine list, along with the requisite Spanish brandy and sherries, but the cocktail list \"won't have a flag to them\", he says. Instead, expect plenty of homemade infusions, bitters and liqueurs and \"a full expression of my style\" rather than a copy-paste rehash of previous recipes.\n\nA star order on his menu, the Good Old Diplomatic Pal, for instance, is a recipe he's been working on for the past year. His take on the classic negroni cocktail works in Diplomatico Reserva rum, a blend of coffee-infused vermouth, artichoke liqueur, a mix of several amari and a blend of bitters. The concoction will then be barrel-aged in a three-tiered solera system made up of different sherry oak casks. Cocktails will start at $12.\n\n\"The added value is the personal touch that you can't replicate elsewhere.

Revenue rose 8.4 per cent in the year to $191.4 million, with the freight and logistics segment continuing to be the main contributor.\n\nFreight and logistics revenue grew 5.9 per cent to $172.6 million, mainly due to increase in demand for business with the completion of the new chemical hub in Jurong Island, the company said.\n\nThe group's financial services segment saw a 39.4 per cent leap in revenue to $16.4 million, mainly from interest income from a loan granted by a subsidiary. However, the segment's net profit was more than halved to $11.4 million, from lower fair value gain on marketable securities, compared to the preceding financial year.\n\nVibrant said it still expects uncertainties in global and regional economic conditions. \"However, the group will continue to strengthen and expand its businesses and will explore viable investment opportunities, to sustain long-term growth and to broaden its revenue and earnings base.\"\n\nLast week, Vibrant announced a deal to acquire Cecil House, with plans to maximise the gross floor area through upgrading and retrofitting work. On Wednesday, it said a subsidiary acquired a 35 per cent equity stake in Equity Plaza.\n\nNet asset value for the group stood at 14.24 cents per share as at end-April, up from 9.56 cents per share in the prior year.\n\nA first and final cash or scrip dividend of 0.55 cent per share was announced, up from 0.5 cent previously.\n\nThe counter fell 0.1 cent to close at 10.3 cents yesterday, before the results were announced.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Closed on Sun\n\nIT'S been a while since we had actual fun in a restaurant. Something with a bit of a neighbourly feel but located in town; that offers a reality check in a sea of overly wrought concepts; where the food is smart without chefs having to be all precious about it; a come-as-you-are approach where everybody really is welcome.\n\nWe don't know what they put into the cranberry juice that comes as part of its excellent value $17.80 two-course lunch at Pluck, but we would say drink up and enjoy the down-to-earth hospitality of this eatery that will change your mind about Club Street being a culinary-challenged zoo of cocktail-hungry posers.\n\nPluck is appealing for its sheer lack of theme, although the long counter seating in front of the open-concept kitchen does, at least, put it into the \"got style\" category. Would be nice if they had more and better tables, though, instead of just two rather functional and almost grudging nods to those who like having their feet on the ground.\n\nStill, the easy-going manner of the knowledgeable manager who does lunch duty, and the camaraderie/spontaneity of chef Brandon Teo and his team (they even photo-bomb your attempt to take a picture of the restaurant) sets the scene for a breezy lunch that lifts any original trepidation we have. Chef Teo puts his stint at Keong Saik Snacks and his own travels to good use in a menu that's an unabashed mash-up of culinary styles and techniques but pulled together with polish.\n\nHe takes pains to offer value and creativity in his bargain set lunch, rather than just offer the obligatory cheap pasta. We're impressed with the potent, creamy brew of emulsified mushrooms (despite an awkward-shaped bowl) served with a large slice of warm and crunchy, lovingly toasted sourdough that's evenly slicked with olive oil.\n\nThe main courses are adaptations of the a la carte, in that slightly cheaper ingredients are used to justify the low cost. But the manner of preparation and flavour is easily a la carte quality. Common tilapia, for example, gets the luxury treatment with crisp pan-seared edges bathed in creamy emulsion that is over-salted by capers, but offset by baby potatoes, regular broccoli and the dehydrated version as a welcome special touch.\n\nThe pork belly is rendered as meaty medallions with little fat, simple brown sauce and straighforward garnish of potatoes and grilled asparagus, which are again slightly salty. Top marks, however, go to the corn-fed chicken which is delivered as impeccably juicy portions of breast meat, starring beside potato gnocchi that exchange stodginess for a perfect chewy bite. Add kailan and a simple sauce and you're set for the rest of the work day.\n\nBut don't deprive yourself of other highlights from the a la carte menu. Not everything is available at lunch (obviously they keep the best for a more leisurely dinner) but we are sold on the 18-hour slow-cooked pork neck ($22) that releases its gristle and yields easily to your knife and fork. Sweet potato puree, spinach and a sticky sweet balsamic reduction with a slight acid kick balance off the whole combination.\n\nWe're a little less enamoured of the somewhat dry seared scallops ($18), although we're taken with the intiguing sauce of potato dashi - Japanese dashi cooked with potato skins for thickening - and the way the salty sweet flavours of apples, bacon and hazelnuts play off one another.\n\nBut we really like the curry-roasted cauliflower ($14), where the tender-crisp spice-dusted florets are turned into crunchy tempura with a crisp batter, sweetened with plump raisins and a creamy sauce.\n\nThe same crunch extends to the goreng pisang-like dessert of bananas, malt and honey ($12) - where a toffee-like caramelised crust encircles the buttery banana, served with tiny meringues and malt ice cream. Torn chocolate sponge pieces, meanwhile, are paired with crisp meringue wafer, sweetened chestnuts and gula melaka ice cream as part of the set lunch dessert ($5 top up), and from the a la carte menu, dainty olive sponge cubes, strawberries and creme fraiche ($14) add up to a quirky deconstruction of strawberry short cake. The ritz cracker ice cream is pleasant enough, but there's little of the salty cracker taste. In fact, all three ice creams we sample seem to share a common Horlicks flavour profile.\n\nWhile there is a tendency for the dishes to start resembling one another after a while, with the use of similar base sauces and style of presentation, there's much to be said about Pluck's ability to craft a strong product without bending to the whims and styles of the day.\n\nIt's all about having the courage of one's convictions, and shall we say, pluck?\n\njaime@sph.com.sg\n\n@JaimeEeBT\n\nRating:\n\n7\n\nWHAT OUR RATINGS MEAN\n\n10: The ultimate dining experience\n\n9-9.5: Sublime\n\n8-8.5: Excellent\n\n7-7.5: Good to very good\n\n6-6.5: Promising\n\n5-5.5: Average\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Ghana were due to play Portugal yesterday.\n\nThe Suarez suspension takes effect immediately and he will not be able to play in Uruguay's second- round match against Colombia tomorrow in Rio de Janeiro, even if he appeals.\n\nThe four-month ban from football activity means he will also be prevented from entering the stadium for tomorrow's game. It will also hit his club career with Liverpool in England's Premier League.\n\nThe sanction was the toughest ever handed down for foul play at a World Cup, surpassing the eight- match ban against Italy's Mauro Tassotti in 1994 for an elbowing incident which broke the nose of Spain's Luis Enrique.\n\nIt is the third time Liverpool star Suarez has been banned for biting players following incidents in 2010 in the Dutch league and in 2013 in England.\n\n\"The Disciplinary Committee took into account all the factors of the case and the degree of Mr Suarez's guilt in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Code,\" Mr Sulser said in a statement.\n\nUruguay football officials had argued against a ban, insisting that Suarez had not bitten anyone and claiming the player was the victim of a media witch- hunt.\n\nUruguayan President Jose Mujica had led the defence of the 27-year-old, telling reporters on Wednesday: \"I did not see him bite anyone.\" But the speed and severity of Fifa's punishment reflected the widespread revulsion throughout the football world at an incident which was captured clearly on television footage.\n\nThere was also photographic evidence of Chiellini's bite mark that he tried to show the referee immediately following the incident.\n\nChiellini himself told Italian television: \"He bit me, it's clear, I still have the mark.\" Suarez sought to play down the incident in comments to Uruguayan television, claiming Chiellini had barged him.\n\n\"There are things that happen on the pitch and you should not make such a big deal out of them,\" Suarez said.\n\nFifa had faced mounting calls to issue a heavy sanction given Suarez's previous disciplinary history.\n\nSponsors had also signalled dismay.\n\nOnline gambling firm 888poker said it was \"reviewing\" its relationship with the player. \"We will not tolerate unsporting behaviour,\" the enterprise said. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Stock markets and market talk suggest that the US will grow strongly, but data has not borne that out, he said.\n\n\"For the first time in a long time I'm actually quite confused about the US market,\" he told a group of private banking clients over lunch at the Ritz-Carlton ballroom yesterday.\n\nUS stock markets are at all-time highs, with the S&P 500 index near 2,000 points and the Dow Jones Industrial Average near 17,000 points. They have been climbing for the last five years. Markets recently shrugged off a first quarter gross domestic product (GDP) contraction of 2.9 per cent, expecting better results in Q2.\n\nMr Gupta said that US GDP growth \"will be lucky to come in at 1.6 to 1.8 per cent this year\", significantly lower than the near-3 per cent that economists forecast at the end of last year - and below the latest 2.1 to 2.3 per cent projections of the Fed. This is because personal consumption growth in the US remains weak at around one per cent.\n\n\"If consumption is not going up, sustainable GDP growth is hard,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, low volatility suggests that he is not alone in not being able to make up his mind on the US market, Mr Gupta said.\n\n\"Volatility comes from people having divergent views,\" he said, adding that low volatility caused global banks to report and forecast lower earnings.\n\nMr Gupta, however, had firmer views on Europe, notably peripheral Europe. He said that the rally in government bond yields in these countries - such as Spain and Italy - might have gone a bit too far. Government debt in these recession-hit countries are now valued near that of the US, whose currency is widely held around the world.\n\nOn Asia and China, he said that news of their demise is \"a bit premature\".\n\nIf China's US$9 trillion economy grows at 6 per cent, it is still creating US$500 billion of value every year. This means plenty of opportunities. The Chinese government also has the resources to deal with their problems, he said. \"They are tweaking the system quite cleverly, not on a mass scale but quite targeted . . . (at) pockets of the economy,\" he said. \"When I put all of that together, I am somewhat more sanguine about China's prospects than a lot of Western commentators seem to be.\"\n\nSingapore, meanwhile, might see some softer growth in the next quarter or two, he said. But on the whole, Asia's prospects, with a more stable China and a resurgent India, are \"likely to be somewhat better than what people think\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Malaysia and Indonesia experienced a tepid first half.\n\nIn terms of value, Singapore took centrestage as well, closing deals worth US$18.7 billion, over 80 per cent of total deals cut in all three markets of US$22.7 billion.\n\nEven so, Singapore fared less well than in the same period a year ago which saw 179 deals valued at US$22 billion, mainly led by the show-stopping TCC Group's $13.8 billion takeover of Fraser & Neave.\n\nFor the rest of this year, going by the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) that are set to come to fruition - think OCBC's acquisition of Wing Hang Bank and Frasers Centrepoint Trust's offer for Australand Property - the deals frenzy could jolly well hold up.\n\n\"Singapore is turning out to be a nice hub for corporate activity. I don't see the deal euphoria dying down pretty soon,\" American Appraisal Singapore managing director Srividya Gopalakrishnan told BT.\n\nPerched atop the activity deck are two cash deals, all done in a hard month's work, by Temasek. In March, the investment firm lobbed a takeover offer at Olam International's other shareholders which cost US$2.5 billion and not too long after, picked up a 24.95 per cent stake in drugstore chain AS Watson for US$5.7 billion.\n\nThe other biggies include CapitaLand's US$2.5 billion privatisation of CapitaMalls Asia and United Industrial Corp's takeover of subsidiary Singapore Land for US$602 million.\n\nAdding more colour to deal activity against a more encouraging global macro backdrop is Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, GIC, which forked out US$400 million for its share in a group bid to buy Time Warner headquarters in New York in January.\n\nData provided by American Appraisal show that Singapore scored high points in all areas - M&A, private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) investments - except for one: new listings.\n\nIPOs fared dismally, drawing merely six listings worth US$694 million on the Singapore Exchange. If not for two - PACC Offshore Services Holding and OUE Commercial Reit - which combined were worth US$581.9 million, one can write off the first half as a deadbeat IPO period, no thanks to demanding investors who turned their kitties elsewhere to more attractive developed markets.\n\nThere are other factors. \"In India and China, ingrown companies now seem to prefer to list at home as there are no currency or foreign exchange risks,\" said Ms Srividya.\n\nOutbound deals made up half of the 116 M&A deals worth US$17.54 billion here followed by 40 per cent of domestic deals while the rest involved inbound investments.\n\n\"Singapore has always been a net buyer, in that there are more outbound than inbound investments. For one, Singapore is a small market. Also, local companies are getting more aggressive in expanding their footprint overseas,\" she added.\n\nNoteworthy is that Singapore has deposed Mauritius as the top source of foreign direct investment (FDI) in India, which could spice things up further.\n\nPE and VC firms zoomed into Singapore with 21 deals worth US$442.5 million, over 80 per cent of the region's PE deal value over the first half.\n\nNot surprisingly then that the region's largest PE deal took place here: the US$162.5 million investment in Singapore-listed Global Logistics Properties Ltd by a Chinese investment consortium led by Bank of China Group.\n\nThe beat went on and on, thanks to LVMH private equity arm L Capital Asia, which invested US$100 million each for stakes in club and lounge operator Ku De Ta Group and restaurant group Crystal Jade Culinary Concepts.\n\nThere are more in the offing such as KKR's US$1.1 billion bid for Singapore container company Goodpack.\n\nThe good mood for more deals could linger for the rest of the year across the globe. The plus factors include an improving US economy, a more stable Europe, cash-rich investors and firms on the prowl for assets plus consolidation in various industries.\n\n\"The only risk that could curb the appetite for more deals is political and geopolitical tension such as in Thailand or Ukraine or Iraq.\n\n\"But for now, it's looking good for the next quarter or so,\" said Ms Srividya.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Gordon Ramsay will open his first restaurant in Singapore called Bread Street Kitchen. Jaime Ee travels to London to speak with his business partner Stuart Gillies about their Asian expansion plans, and how the company has traded its troubled past for a bright future\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 27, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIF there's one thing Gordon Ramsay learnt from his mega-hyped cook-off with Singapore hawkers last year, it's this: he may not be able to cook laksa, but he sure can draw the crowds even as far away from home as South-east Asia. And that people-pulling magic will be put to the test when he opens his first restaurant in Singapore early next year at Marina Bay Sands (MBS).\n\nThe restaurant, Bread Street Kitchen, will take up space in the shopping mall section of the integrated resort which already has a celebrity chef presence in the form of Daniel Boulud's db Bistro, Mario Batali's Mozza and Wolfgang Puck's Cut. Stuart Gillies - Ramsay's partner and managing director of the Gordon Ramsay Group - says that they are in final talks with MBS, which will be their partner in the project. He explains that Bread Street Kitchen will be modelled after its successful London restaurant, which currently packs in an international crowd of some 15,000 people a month in its vibrant, theatrical space featuring multiple concepts from raw bar to grill to cocktails.\n\nThe concept is such that it can be scaled to be as upmarket or as casual as the market dictates. \"You can eat light and quick, or you can really indulge,\" says Gillies. So while the plan is to open one in Hong Kong first and then in Singapore, they will not be carbon copies. \"There'll be a 60 per cent to 70 per cent template, but the rest will be adapted according to the local market.\"\n\nBut there's a greater significance to the concept of Bread Street Kitchen than just its exportability to the Asian market. Launched three years ago in London, Bread Street marked the Gordon Ramsay Group's move into an all-new business direction after a major shake-up that nearly saw the company go belly up around 2010. After a messy split with his former partner and father-in-law Chris Hutcheson, Ramsay installed his trusted friend Gillies (who was already running several restaurants in the group) as managing director and sole partner, and the duo spent the last few years literally \"cleaning up the mess\", says Gillies.\n\nOne strategy that came out of that restructure was to look at diversifying the business beyond just growing restaurants moulded around Ramsay's three-Michelin star chef persona. \"We needed to broaden our horizons and ambitions to incorporate what the world wants which isn't just great food but everything - noise, theatre, cocktails, music, design. People want the whole package.\"\n\nThat's why they've been recruiting experts from different fields to create a stable of talent to drive the next stage of growth, which is \"individual standalone brands\" such as Bread Street Kitchen which has its own identity, but with links to Gordon Ramsay more as a guarantee of quality than his name per se.\n\nThis is partly why they took this long to come to Asia, says Gillies, speaking to BT Living at the spiffy Savoy Grill in London, which is part of the Ramsay stable.\n\n\"The Asian market has always been on our radar - it was a question of 'when', not 'if'. We knew there were many opportunities - it was just about choosing the right partner - but we wanted to wait (during the cleaning up process) until we had the resources to manage, support and control (the Asian projects) properly.\"\n\nThey could easily have signed up for as many deals as they wanted in the last three years, he adds, because so many people have approached them. \"There was money flying in from everywhere but there was no guarantee we could protect the brand and its integrity. The deal is important to us but what's more important is protecting the integrity of the brand.\"\n\nThey also want to make sure they choose the right partner because \"we would never go somewhere and think we can do as well in a foreign territory as we do in London - that would be suicide\". And Gillies believes they have found the right match with MBS in Singapore and Dining Concepts in Hong Kong. Still, he admits having misgivings initially about opening a restaurant in MBS's shopping complex, until he saw how \"the shopping mall culture in Europe and Asia is completely different\". In London, \"people literally just shop and leave, but in Asia, it's like a day out!\"\n\nOf course, he sees potential in the region beyond just the one restaurant in Hong Kong and Singapore. \"Macau is an obvious one (since MBS is there); Shanghai and other parts of China; and the Middle East. And we could probably open a few more in Hong Kong and Singapore but before that, we have to get the first one right.\"\n\nHe feels that everything has fallen into place now because, \"If we had gone into Asia four years ago, we would only have had certain concepts. We wouldn't have had Bread Street Kitchen, Union Street Cafe, London House, our burger concept - so it's good that we waited and now we're super-confident in what we have.\"\n\nIn fact, the company is now stronger than ever, although he expresses dismay at a recent report which said that the company had lost \u00a36 million (S$12.7 million) in its last financial year. \"It was a provision,\" he explains. \"It's not a loss of the business. Our EBITDA is around \u00a35.1 million. We made a provision because we have an onerous lease in the business where the rent is far too high and we're in litigation over it. It was all part of the cleanup from the last few years - the legal and tax issues, the third parties we had to use, which all cost money. So the auditors said you're losing money on (the lease) so you have to make a provision or it will add up. So we put it into the accounts. It's not a loss as such, and we did explain it carefully (to the media), but it makes a nice headline.\"\n\nGillies is pretty sanguine now about the crisis that the company went through in the hands of Ramsay's father-in-law. \"Many businesses lose their way. Especially when the economy is good - there were really big fat years in London from 2002 to 2006 where everyone was making money and spending money. Then the crunch came in 2008 and it all started to change very quickly. The businesses that survived were those that reviewed their whole structure. But it's worked out well for us. It's a better foundation now that will see us through the next 20 years because of the diversity we have developed.\"\n\nWhich means we'll see a lot more of Gordon Ramsay in this part of the world - if not with a wok, at least in the way we dine in the near future.\n\njaime@sph.com.sg\n\n@JaimeEeBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The previous record was for a US$34.2 million painting called Abstraktes Bild (1994) sold in 2012.\n\nIf you looked at the two paintings, you would not have thought they were by the same artist. The former is a grand photo-realist masterpiece depicting the Cathedral Square in Milan; the latter is an abstract melange of crackling reds, greens and yellows clashing with sullen blacks.\n\nThe German artist belongs to the school of artists who do not maintain a single cohesive style. And the ongoing retrospective of his works at the Beyeler Foundation museum in Basel, Switzerland demonstrates that beautifully. From room to room, your perspective of the artist changes as seemingly contradictory elements of his practice emerge.\n\nSome of the photo-realist portraits and landscapes are beatific and calming - and then you're confronted with his 4R photographs that have been coarsely painted over in a slapdash way. Similarly, the abstract paintings have a fierce, questing vitality that could quicken your pulse, only to have it beat slower when you see his dull, featureless monochromes - painted in grey, of all colours.\n\nJudging by the reaction of the visitors to the museum, it is his large abstracts - cutting, clashing, combative - that fascinate many. His November, December and January (1989), for instance, placed near the entrance of the exhibition, comprise three massive canvases in which he attempted to depict the battle of light and dark during those cold months.\n\nHere you see the techniques he's famous for: First, he applies paint on the canvas using a big housepainter's brush to create big casual swaths of colour, which he may or may not paint over with other colours. Then the destruction begins: He takes a metal squeegee (like the kind window washers use) and scrapes away what he has painted. Because the paint is so dense, some colours remain while others are swiped away, creating new electrifying geometrics and compositions.\n\nOne marvels at the efficient way he creates happenstance in a painting. But documentaries and YouTube videos show him carrying out these actions with surgical precision.\n\nPerhaps his most controversial works of all time are his Baader-Meinhof series from the 1980s. Richter gained notoriety for his photo-realist paintings based on images of the Red Army Faction (RAF), a terrorist group in Germany.\n\nAfter three of its arrested members were found hanged in their prison cells, he painted their images in haunting black-and-white - prompting public accusations that he was lionising them.\n\nAll the works in that series are presented here, including the three, increasingly blurry images of the dead founding member Ulrike Meinhof, with rope-burns around her neck. Two decades on, these paintings still have the power to shock.\n\nRichter is famously reticent when asked to explain his art. He once said: \"Theory has nothing to do with a work of art. Pictures which are interpretable, and which contain a meaning, are bad pictures. A picture presents itself as the unmanageable, the illogical, the meaningless. It demonstrates the endless multiplicity of aspects.\"\n\n'Gerhard Richter: Pictures/Series' is on at the Beyeler Foundation until Sept 7. It is located at Baselstrasse 101, 4125 Riehen, Basel, Switzerland and can be easily reached on Tram No 6 from the city centre. Opens daily\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/testing-women-heart-artery-disease", "site_title": "Testing women for heart artery disease", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nTesting women for heart artery disease\n\nWomen who have heart artery disease are often under diagnosed as they usually do not display typical symptoms\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 27, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE differences between women and men extend to the nature of heart artery disease. Most of the research data that has been published on heart artery disease was mainly based on study populations that had a predominantly male bias and it is only more recently that there has been evidence that women often do not have typical symptoms. This has resulted in under diagnosis and under treatment of women with heart artery disease, leading to higher death rates and increased complications.\n\nNon-chest pain symptoms\n\nWhile men with blockage of their heart arteries usually experience chest pain or chest tightness on physical exertion, women may have symptoms that are precipitated by mental or emotional stress rather than physical exertion. In addition to chest pain, women may suffer from upper abdominal discomfort, pain radiating to neck or arm, tiredness or shortness of breath. Due to the non-specific symptoms of women, there may be a possibility of an increasing referral of women for diagnostic testing to determine more accurately those who have a higher likelihood for heart attacks in the future.\n\nTo address this concern, a June 2014 American Heart Association (AHA) Consensus Statement on the role of non-invasive diagnostic testing for women addresses the choice of diagnostic testing in the most cost effective manner based on current evidence.\n\nDiagnostic assessment\n\nThe use of questionnaire-based risk scoring systems, also termed global risk assessment, attempts to determine the likelihood of heart artery disease. Much of the data used was old and hence less applicable to current situations. The Framingham risk score, which was the most commonly used, has been abandoned in favour of a new risk scoring system proposed by the AHA. The new system is meant for use in specific population groups in the US and is not meant to be applied to Asian populations. Furthermore, risk assessment scoring systems are meant for asymptomatic populations and are not meant to be used for those with symptoms.\n\nHow then should women decide when to seek assessment for heart artery disease? A few general principles prevail based on current evidence. The likelihood of significant heart artery disease increases with age and with increased number of risk factors such as smoking, high cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure and family history of heart disease. Women who are symptomatic but are premenopausal are considered low risk unless they have diabetes. Those in their 50s to 60s who are limited in their activities by symptoms are considered of intermediate risk and those in their 70s or older who are symptomatic are considered high risk. If they have multiple risk factors, the risk category will be increased by one category. Those considered high risk will also include those with stroke, impairment of kidney function, smoking related lung disease, and blockage of leg arteries.\n\nChoice of tests\n\nLow risk premenopausal women generally do not require diagnostic testing although there may be exceptions. For low risk premenopausal women with symptoms very typical of heart artery disease, a treadmill stress test can be considered as the first choice test. The most important consideration for premenopausal women undergoing diagnostic assessment for their heart is to avoid the use of tests that require exposure to X-ray or ionising radiation which means that nuclear and X-ray scans of the heart should be avoided, and other alternatives should be considered.\n\nFor those who are considered to be of intermediate risk (premenopausal women with risk factors or women in their 50s to 60s with typical symptoms), a treadmill exercise stress test can be the first option for diagnostic assessment provided that the resting electrocardiogram (ECG) is normal and the person is able to perform a treadmill test. The ECG is a recording of the heart's electrical pattern and if the ECG at rest is abnormal, it may affect the accuracy of the treadmill test. Those with intermediate to high risk who are unsuitable for treadmill test should be considered for a nuclear scan, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or computed tomography (CT) scan to assess the heart.\n\nExercise stress test\n\nMany women in their 50s and 60s find the standard treadmill protocol too physically demanding and hence, these women should discuss with their doctors about using modified protocols (such as the modified Bruce protocol) which provide a more gradual increase in exercise level. However, if despite using a physically less demanding protocol, they are unable to achieve 85 per cent of the maximum predicted heart rate, heart disease should be suspected. The new formula for calculation of maximum heart rate is 206 - (0.88 x age). Those who are unable to complete 85 per cent or more of their age-predicted heart rate have at least two times increased risk of death. If a standard Bruce protocol is used, the inability to go beyond stage one of the Bruce protocol or achieve more than five metabolic equivalents of exercise predicts increased risk of death and other events related to blockage of heart arteries independent of traditional risk factors.\n\nOne needs to understand the limitations of a treadmill test. In meta-analysis of 19 exercise treadmill stress tests, the average sensitivity and specificity of the tests were 61 per cent and 70 per cent for women respectively, and 72 per cent and 77 per cent among men. It means that for every 100 women with significant blockage of the heart arteries, the treadmill test will be abnormal for 61 and 39 may go undetected.\n\nChoose wisely\n\nOf the other non-invasive tests available, stress echocardiography (ultrasound imaging of the heart) and MRI scans have no X-ray radiation and are options for symptomatic women at intermediate to high risk of heart artery disease, and can even be used for premenopausal women. Nuclear scans and CT scan of the heart arteries have X-ray radiation. A stress nuclear scan of the heart has X-ray radiation exposure of about 11 mSv. (millisievert or mSv is the unit used to measure radiation exposure to the body). The potential impact of this radiation dose is an estimated additional three to eight persons at risk of cancer for every 10,000. CT scan of the heart arteries will typically result in three to five mSv using low dose scanning protocols and 12 to 25 mSv for standard protocols.\n\nInvasive coronary angiography, which involves inserting tubings into the heart arteries, has an average radiation dose of about seven mSv depending on the number of views taken. Real world accuracies for these tests can differ substantially from reported published data from high volume centres. As stated in this June's AHA statement, \"the issue of local expertise guides test performance and selection for all imaging modalities\" and this means that local expertise has an impact on the accuracy of the tests chosen.\n\nFor symptomatic women with intermediate risk with abnormal resting ECG or uncertain or abnormal treadmill test, CT scan of the heart arteries is a reasonable option as it allows visualisation of the heart arteries unlike, stress echocardiography or nuclear scans. For premenopausal women with functional disability, CT of the heart arteries can also be considered if the centre is able to achieve a radiation dose of not more than three mSv. Unlike men, symptomatic women with non-significantly blocked heart arteries are at increased risk of heart attacks and can benefit from medical treatment. One of the advantages of CT is that women with non-significant blockage of the heart arteries can be identified. Last but not least, MRI of the heart arteries is an option where no X-ray radiation and no injection is required but it is only available in few specialised centres. As it is not associated with any X-ray radiation, it can be used even for premenopausal women with suspected heart disease.\n\nIn summary, symptomatic premenopausal women do not require testing unless they have risk factors. If testing is required, a treadmill test is the first choice. However, if the treadmill test cannot be performed because of physical limitations or abnormal resting ECG, other options such as MRI scan or stress echocardiography which do not have any X-ray radiation should be considered. CT scan should only be considered if a radiation dose of 3 mSv or less can be achieved. For those with intermediate to high risks, the choice of the test should take into consideration the cancer risk of X-ray radiation and the accuracy and expertise of the centres providing the tests.\n\nThis series is brought to you by Heart, Stroke and Cancer Centre.

From today, residents in Hamburg can just walk in off the high street.\n\nThe Swedish chain opened its first city-centre store in the district of Altona, the most westerly of Hamburg's seven boroughs, in a pilot project targeting a rising number of urbanites who dread the long haul to its traditional outlets with their distinctive blue and yellow design. The store opening, which is costing the company 80 million euros (S$136.5 million), is an experiment for Ikea, breaking new ground in its largest market, said Johannes Ferber, the managing director who's spearheading Ikea's expansion in Germany.\n\n\"It's a very expensive experiment for us, but we want to know if the city-store concept works out,\" he said. \"Altona could serve as a model for other big cities such as Berlin.\"\n\nThe venture is part of a wider trend by retailers to populate urban centres as companies from Tesco to Carrefour open smaller downtown shops. Carmakers are also discovering city centres. Daimler this month opened its first ever Mercedes Me store, also in Hamburg, with a bistro, gallery area and a single car on show.\n\nIkea, which operates 356 stores worldwide, has 49 centres in Germany. The Altona outlet is its third in the port town, Germany's second-largest and most affluent city in terms of gross domestic product per capita, according to statistics compiled by the local business development authority.\n\nThe decision to situate the store in Altona came as the retailer sought a third location in Hamburg, said Mr Ferber. It was approached by the local municipality, which offered the site that had been abandoned for more than six years, he said.\n\nThe retailer expects an average 4,000 customers per working day and about twice as many on Saturdays and other peak days, compared with as many as 12,000 at sites in Munich and Berlin, he said.\n\n\"There are many city-dwellers who don't have a car or aren't willing to drive outside the city to do their shopping,\" said Mr Ferber, adding that he expects more than half of Altona clients to travel to the store by public transport or by bike.\n\nIkea will lend out cargo bikes and clients may borrow bike trailers for free to transport their purchases home if they return them within three hours. Alternatively, customers can order bike couriers at a starting price of 9.90 euros to do the physical work and let them carry their goods home, larger furniture boxes included, according to the company.\n\n\"It's a big challenge for us as we needed a good traffic and service concept to get products to clients' homes within a short period of time,\" Mr Ferber said.\n\nIkea also tailored its product selection in Altona to the 150,000 potential customers that live within a three-kilometre radius of the store, including shelves, boxes and baskets. Local staff visited about 200 apartments in the area to assess the challenges clients face, said Mr Ferber.\n\n\"There are many people in Hamburg who take their expensive bicycles into their apartments as they don't have a basement, and we have found solutions for that\" by developing a special clamp to hang a bicycle on the wall, he said.\n\nUnlike Ikea's typical hypermarkets with few windows, the Altona store's ground floor has a large glass front displaying products such as Skruvsta swivel chairs for 99 euros and Maskros lamps for 39 euros.\n\nThe store opening sparked opposition from some locals, who voiced their criticism by attaching \"Kill Billy\" stickers to lamp posts and trash cans in a reference to Ikea's hallmark Billy shelves, fearing the store opening will inflate rents and property prices.\n\nProponents organised a referendum in Altona in January 2010, with 77 per cent of voters in favour of the store.\n\n\"For Ikea, it must be a very different experience from setting up a store on a green field on the outskirts, as they need to come to terms with their neighbours here,\" said Florian Kroeger, who runs a deli on the other side of the pedestrian zone. Mr Kroeger's family has owned the little Claus Kroeger store for 90 years, selling a selection of teas, coffee and wine.\n\nMr Kroeger, 41, said that he's in favour because the store will bring a long-needed boost to the traditional working class area. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

The expectation of structural reform in both countries is causing investor confidence to return.\n\nSome research houses and funds are calling China stocks and bonds value plays, when earlier this year they warned of a financial crisis. China's Big Four banks are now up 15 per cent from March lows. The price of an investment-grade US$800 million bond due 2018 issued by China's largest property developer, China Vanke, is near a one-year high.\n\nAnecdotally, private banks are busy catering to demand for high-yielding Chinese debt, from vanilla bonds issued by China property companies to structured products betting that China banks will not go bankrupt despite fuelling the country's debt binge.\n\nIndia's twin current and fiscal account deficits scared away investors last August and caused the rupee to plunge. Today, India is a market darling and up 20 per cent year-to-date. Indian assets could see further upside if the country's ratings are upgraded and if investors like its July 10 budget announcement.\n\nNeeraj Seth, head of Asia-Pacific credit at fund manager BlackRock, said investment-grade bonds in China used to yield 25 to 30 basis points above similarly rated South Korean bonds. Now, they yield 75 basis points more. \"As you go down the credit curve, the differential gets bigger. China high yield, BB-rated, has a 520 basis point spread. B-rated bonds have 800 basis points of spread.\n\n\"They are also anywhere between 250 to 400 basis points above what you'd get for US and Europe for similar-rated risk . . . China credit, similar to equities, is under-owned.\"\n\nLeong Wai Hoong, senior portfolio manager at Nikko Asset Management Asia, said property developer dollar bond issuers in China \"represent the strongest part of their industry, they are achieving sales higher than the national average\". The company's funds hold a range of China investment-grade and non-investment-grade bonds. \"Bankruptcies will happen but all these are small companies. The big issuers will benefit from less competition, they can buy assets at distressed prices,\" he said.\n\nSteve Brice, chief investment strategist at Standard Chartered Bank, is trying to convince clients that short-duration Chinese bonds denominated in onshore and offshore renminbi are a good diversification tool. Investment-grade bonds there are offering returns of 6-8 per cent over the next 12 months, he said. He does not expect the currency to depreciate much more. When fears over rising interest rates hit last year, these \"CNY and CNH\" bonds were barely affected, while almost every other asset class fell. \"Chinese bonds are a very insulated market.\"\n\nBut the outlook for the banking sector in China is key, he said. Negatives such as interest rate liberalisation affecting bank profits and worries over a spike in non-performing loans hang in the background.\n\nFor equities, Citi Private Bank's Asia investment strategist Ken Peng likes industrials. He expects the yuan to appreciate with more confidence in the economy. Meanwhile, the recent depreciation of the currency will help companies relying on exports, he said.\n\nChina stocks, which are trading below 10 times earnings, look relatively cheap even as recent data point towards stabilising economic growth, he said. \"We believe in a tactical overweight and a cyclical rebound, but the upside will be capped when the reform process starts again.\"\n\nAnother overhang is how China is still adding on a lot of debt and the deleveraging process has not started, he said.\n\nIn India, markets have already bet on new Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ability to reform the country, attract foreign investment and promote economic growth. Andrew Swan, head of Asian equities at BlackRock, said in his second-half outlook: \"Domestic cyclicals are direct beneficiaries of reform. In addition, we see opportunities in the energy (coal and gas) and industrial sectors.\"\n\nDesmond Soon, co-head of investment management Asia ex-Japan at fixed income investor Western Asset Management, expects \"quick wins\" for Mr Modi if he can revive stalled investment projects, cut fuel price subsidies to improve the budget deficit, and mitigate the effect of higher food prices due to expected lower monsoon rainfall.\n\n\"We are keenly aware that Modi's overwhelming mandate will not translate into an immediate improvement in India's economic fundamentals,\" he said, referring to India's relatively weak GDP growth of about 5 per cent, a current account deficit of around 3 per cent of GDP and a budget deficit of 6 per cent in 2013.\n\nGenerally, investor appetite for stocks and bonds continues to be strong, even as volatility declines to historically low levels. The 10-year government bond yields of recession-hit Spain and Italy, notably, are trading near the low 2.6 per cent yields offered by US Treasuries. Niggling doubts have arisen on whether markets are becoming too complacent in the face of seemingly abundant central bank liquidity from major economic regions US, Europe and Japan. Bears argue that investors are heedlessly brushing aside geopolitical risks such as Iraq and Ukraine, and the potential for higher-than-expected US inflation to destabilise the market.\n\nThe biggest risk facing the market, observers say, is an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve. US inflation is carefully watched because higher inflation puts pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates to cool down an overheating economy. Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs, preventing prices from spiralling out of control. Higher US rates could lead to a repeat of the \"taper tantrums\" of last year, when emerging markets in Asia and elsewhere experienced outflows as investors sought better yields in the less risky US.\n\nIn her latest press conference, Fed chairman Janet Yellen was nonchalant about inflation potentially rising above the Fed's 2 per cent target. Inflation had come in higher than expected for two to three consecutive months. She said the data was \"noisy\".\n\nThe Consumer Price Index rose by 2.1 per cent year on year in May. But the Fed prefers the core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) metric, which it expects to rise between 1.5 and 1.6 per cent this year, and hitting the 2 per cent mark only in 2015-2016. The core PCE index grew 1.5 per cent in May, data released last night showed.\n\nSeveral strategists say that even if interest rates start getting hiked up, it will be a couple of years before the overnight rate hits the 4 per cent level when bull markets typically end.\n\nNot everybody believes the Fed's assurances on lower rates for longer. The research department of French bank Societe Generale argued in recent pieces that it expects a marked improvement in housing activity, higher healthcare costs and higher wage growth. \"We expect the evidence to continue to build through the summer months, making it increasingly difficult to maintain the dovish tone at the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting,\" it said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In March, Chinese authorities sent in workers to dig up the course and tear down the clubhouse.\n\nTwo others across China were also demolished while another was turned into an eco-friendly park and a fifth converted into a tea plantation, suggesting that the government could finally be cracking down on developers who have long ignored a 2004 ban on building new golf courses.\n\nThe government, which announced the demolitions last month, said that its actions served as a warning and an attempt to educate \"would be\" violators. A few weeks later, the national auditor joined in, publicly shaming two big state-run enterprises for building golf courses.\n\n\"It's a stepped-up campaign for sure,\" said one Chinese developer, whose company built a course after the ban and who spoke on the condition that neither his name, his firm nor the course be identified.\n\nNevertheless, developers interviewed by Reuters expressed little concern, saying that golf courses were in demand by local authorities who wanted the revenue from selling land while attracting well-heeled visitors to their regions.\n\nThe ban was imposed to protect China's shrinking land and water resources in a country home to a fifth of the world's population but which has just 7 per cent of its water. The only place exempt is the southern resort island of Hainan.\n\nDevelopers had built 639 golf courses across China up to the end of last year, tripling the total since 2004, according to the website of Forward Management Group, a company based in the southern city of Shenzhen that offers a range of golf services in China.\n\nTo skirt the ban, developers and local officials designate land for anything other than a golf course in building applications, developers and lawyers said, calling the projects sports training centres or tourist resorts. Many come complete with high-end villas.\n\nBecause of the large tracts of land needed for such projects, China's cabinet must give approval, said lawyer Zhu Maoyuan, who has seen disguised applications. \"I have never seen developers and local governments use 'golf course' as a project name or for land use purposes when seeking approval,\" he said.\n\nMany applications simply get the go ahead from local authorities, said the Chinese developer.\n\nThe central government has promised to clamp down on illegal golf course construction before but the demolition order against the five mainly little-known developers by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China's top economic planning body, has been the first real sign of enforcement.\n\nLast week, China's National Audit Office, in a wide-ranging report on state firms, said that China National Tobacco had built one illegal golf course and China Metallurgical Group, two courses. They were constructed from 2007-2012.\n\nIn response, China Tobacco said in a statement that it had ordered the closure of the course. China Metallurgical said that it had begun the \"asset disposal process\" and had punished the officials responsible.\n\nThe crackdown could be more serious now because of China's pollution crisis, developers said. One of the reasons for the 2004 ban was because the high use of fertiliser and pesticide to grow grass for golf courses was causing water pollution.\n\n\"The way many golf courses are built and managed has a negative impact on the environment,\" said Ma Jun, a director at the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs in Beijing, a non-governmental organisation.\n\nGolf has come a long way in China since it was banned as a bourgeois excess by late leader Mao Zedong, with many wealthy Chinese seeing it as a way to affirm their status.\n\nAt the Mission Hills golf course in Shenzhen, joining membership fees can cost up to two million yuan (S$402,000), according to the club's website.\n\nBut no one got a chance to tee off at the course in the Chaoyang district of Beijing, which was demolished before it opened.\n\nDuring a recent visit to the 60-hectare site, a villager in his 20s told Reuters how workers wiped out virtually all trace of the course in a few weeks.\n\n\"Trucks went in and out. They almost destroyed the road in our village,\" said the man, surnamed Wang, who declined to give his full name.\n\nSomeone has since planted corn on parts of the muddy land.\n\nThe NDRC said that the course had been built by Lao He Wan Investment under the guise of the Delong Agricultural Model Park. Reuters could not find any trace of the company.\n\nAmong the other courses demolished, one was built in south-western Yunnan province by a subsidiary of medium-sized Chinese property developer Agile Property Holdings, the NDRC said.\n\nAll five developers were fined.\n\nUp to now, building a golf course has been a win-win for developers and local governments.\n\nA second Chinese developer said that he was invited by a local government in eastern China in the years after the ban to build a golf course to help the region lure wealthy residents.\n\n\"We got the land cheaply. We made money from selling villas around the golf course and the government got the domestic consumption it wanted,\" said the developer, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nAn executive at a third developer said that his firm had constructed a golf course in southern Guangdong province after 2004 and was now planning to build 100 ultra-luxury villas around it. The expected sale price: 70 million yuan each. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

In the past 12 months, more than 68,000 new Central Depository (CDP) Accounts have been opened, the highest 12-month addition ever and one which brings the total number of CDP acounts to 1.6 million.\n\nAt a press briefing last week on Singapore Exchange's ongoing retail initiatives, SGX's senior vice-president for retail investors, Lynn Gaspar, said that about half of all CDP accounts or a record-high 844,000 actually held some shares.\n\n\"Subscription to SGX's My Gateway's e-newsletter over the past 12 months has risen 21 per cent to 187,000 and the increase in unique visitors to our website has been 45 per cent over the same period,\" she said.\n\nHowever, she added that, notwithstanding the increase in interest, the proportion of Singaporeans who invested in the stock market is still low when compared with other markets.\n\n\"Only about 8-10 per cent of the population is in stocks, compared with 20-25 per cent in Hong Kong and 15-20 per cent in Australia,\" said Ms Gaspar. \"If you assume the potential retail investor population to be about three million people, only about one third has some direct involvement in stocks while 62 per cent has never been in the market. Of these people, about 400,000 are interested in getting into the market. Based on a survey we conducted in 2012, we found that the barriers to entry for these people are they don't know how to start, don't know where to start and don't have the time or money.\"\n\nThe exchange believes it is important that the retail public gain awareness of how to invest in stocks.\n\n\"Singaporeans are today concerned with whether they have enough savings for retirement\" said Ms Gaspar. \"I believe the question should really be: how can I make my savings work harder for me? The key lies in starting early and having a diversified portfolio, including investing in shares over the long term.\"\n\nTo help interested but inexperiened retail players gain some insights into the stock market, SGX has partnered local firm TradeHero, which offers a mobile market trading application that can be downloaded onto phones.\n\nThe exchange is also offering up to $198,000 in prize money in its StockWhiz contest which is open to Singapore residents aged 18 years and above, the aim of which is to allow the public to learn to trade with virtual money.\n\n\"TradeHero allows investors to trade using real-time prices,\" said Ms Gaspar. \"We feel this is a great chance for the public to gain risk-free experience on how to trade.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the experiment involving the digital currency, they learned how to make donations to their chosen charities from their Bitcoin wallets.\n\nThe Singapore investment company's chairman Lim Boon Heng said it was both a \"fun exercise\" to open their minds and a small step in engaging the emerging digital future.\n\nSpeaking at a reception on Thursday (Friday morning, Singapore time) to mark the opening of Temasek's new US office in New York City, he said: \"While we see ourselves as a source of thoughtful long-term capital, we are mindful of the promise and opportunities of the digital world of tomorrow.\"\n\nThe event at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel was attended by some 270 people, including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Temasek executive director and chief executive Ho Ching, high-flyers of the business community and top government officials.\n\nMr Lim said in his speech: \"We are an owner interested in the world of tomorrow, even as we invest today. We are not bound by notions of geographic limits, and try not to be trapped in our comfort zones.\"\n\nTemasek's New York office occupies the entire 14th floor of the Seagram Building, in the midtown Manhattan business district. This office will work closely with Temasek's branches in Mexico City and Sao Paulo in Brazil to cover North and South America, said Mr Lim.\n\nIn his remarks, PM Lee noted that the New York office was opening against the backdrop of Singapore's strong ties with the US and the US' vital role in Asia and the rest of the world. \"The office will anchor Temasek's interest in the Americas, and be the focal point for Temasek to invest in and prosper with promising companies in the US,\" he said.\n\n\"It will bring Temasek closer to its portfolio companies here, and facilitate its investments in new growth sectors such as energy, health care, new media and technology,\" he added.\n\nThis is the second overseas office Temasek opened this year, after the one in London, which covers the European and African markets.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The six contracts - out of 22 major contracts - total $1.361 billion.\n\nThey account for 27 per cent of the major civil contracts for the TSL - higher than the nine out of 37 contracts, or 24 per cent, awarded to local players for the Downtown Line.\n\nThe $18 billion TSL is Singapore's sixth MRT line and connects northern Singapore to the CBD and Marina Bay area. It will be ready in phases from 2019 to 2021. The 30-kilometre long line will be fully underground with 22 stations, of which six will be interchanges.\n\nDuring the groundbreaking ceremony at the Woodlands Station project site yesterday, Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew said that this will bring to 30 the number of interchange stations across the rail network by 2021 - up from 19 today - and strengthen the overall resilience of the rail network.\n\n\"This will give commuters more alternative routes on the rail network to their desired destinations and minimise their inconvenience should there be service disruptions,\" said Mr Lui.\n\nThe TSL, which will run roughly parallel to the existing North-South MRT Line, will help to relieve crowding on the latter by providing a projected 60 per cent in additional capacity to the North-South corridor.\n\n\"More than 400,000 commuters living and working along the Thomson Line will enjoy greater accessibility, more travel options and shorter, more direct journeys to their destinations,\" said the minister.\n\nHe said that the Thomson Line is part of the government's efforts \"to improve the capacity and service levels of our rail network as quickly as we can\".\n\nHe added: \"Over the next three years, Singaporeans will continue to see new lines and extensions opening, as we continue at an unprecedented pace of rail building.\"\n\nMr Lui was referring to the West Loop of the Punggol LRT to be opened tomorrow, the North-South Line Extension to open later this year, the Tuas West Extension in 2016, and the fully opened 42 km Downtown Line in 2017. With these, Singapore's rail network will expand by 25 per cent by 2017.\n\nMr Lui also revealed that an additional station, called Canberra station, will be built between Yishun and Sembawang on the North-South Line.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This translates into an illustrative annual distribution per unit yield of 8.8 to 9.1 per cent.\n\nThe offering consists of an international placement of 164.6 million units, a public offering in Singapore of 41.2 million units, and a public offering without listing in Japan of 576.3 million units.\n\nDaiwa Capital Markets and Citigroup Global Markets are the joint bookrunners.\n\nSeparately, the sponsor, Japanese golf operator Accordia Golf, will receive 317.1 million units, or close to 29 per cent of total units, as part settlement of the consideration for the initial portfolio acquisition.\n\nAG Trust's initial portfolio includes 89 golf courses across Japan, with the bulk of them located in the three largest metropolitan areas - the Greater Tokyo region, the Greater Nagoya Region and the Greater Osaka Region. According to the prospectus, these areas have better transport infrastructure and courses are generally able to attract more visitors and generate higher revenue.\n\nNet proceeds from the listing will mainly be used to fund the acquisition of the initial portfolio.\n\nAccording to AG Trust's pro forma financial performance for its full-year ended March 31, 2013, revenue was 53.6 million yen (S$660,000) while net profit stood at 5.9 million yen, about 4 per cent up from the previous year.\n\nThe Singapore public offer is expected to open on July 22 and close on July 24.

We want to know when you're at home, with your kids.\"\n\nThe Web search giant is expanding Android as an underlying software foundation to become a digital gatekeeper to consumers. The more that Google can connect devices, vehicles and other items with its software, the more likely it is that consumers will stick with the company for all their needs.\n\nRivals like Apple and Amazon are also pushing to tie more services and devices together. Earlier this month, Apple showed how its iOS software for the iPad and iPhone and its Mac operating system are increasingly working together, with a customer able to answer a call to an iPhone on his or her iMac. Apple is also looking to get into smartwatches to broaden its product ecosystem.\n\nAmazon has introduced Fire Phone, a smartphone that is closely connected to the Web retailer's online store and library of movies plus other content.\n\nGoogle is looking to add new features as well, including 3-D technologies for mobile phones and tablets. The effort, called Project Tango, will be included in a device from LG Electronics next year, Johnny Lee, technical project lead for the group at Google, said at last week's conference.\n\nThe technologies can help users easily render 3-D images of a home and also offer new opportunities for games and other applications, he said.\n\n\"With Apple already in the TV and car space and rumoured to be attacking wearables, Google doesn't want developers to have any excuse to choose Apple's ecosystem over Android,\" Carl Howe, an analyst with the Yankee Group, said. \"Therefore, Google wants to ensure that it is in all those places too.\"\n\nSmartphones based on Android, which Google gives to hardware manufacturers for free, made up 78 per cent of the global industry in 2013, up from 66 per cent in 2012, according to Gartner Inc. The No 2 player was Apple's iPhone, which had 16 per cent, down from 19 per cent.\n\nThe new version of Android, dubbed L, will let them easily implement features such as animations and will include more privacy tools, executives said. It also has a feature that lets people disable their smartphones if they get stolen.\n\n\"We have been working very hard,\" Mr Pichai said, adding that Android now has more than one billion active users. \"This is one of the most comprehensive releases we have done.\"\n\nThat inclusive approach extended into a battery of new gadgets and areas where Android will play. Google announced new smartwatches at the event, with one from LG Electronics that had apps loaded onto it and that is available through Google's Play online store. Some of the watches have capabilities that enable it to be used as a remote control for other devices. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

BT Weekend susses out the go-to sites that take the legwork - and guesswork - out of planning for that big day\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 27, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nVenuerific\n\nwww.venuerific.com/sg\n\nTasked with booking your company's annual corporate dinner? Finding the right event space for that often can be a painfully tedious process of back and forths as you get on the phone, scour the internet or trek through town to view options.\n\n31-year-old Ricardo Sentosa wants to make things easier so last year, he launched a website called Venuerific, which lists over 200 available-for-rent event spaces around Singapore. These includes restaurants, pubs, convention halls, rooftops and even yachts. Think of it as an Airbnb for restaurants.\n\nThrough the website, consumers can check a space's maximum capacity, amenities, location and even request for a quote to see if the estimated price displayed is within their budget.\n\nPrices of the venues depend on factors such as time of day and duration, but in general, people can expect to pay a minimum of about $3,000 to rent a section of a bar or cafe for a few hours or at least $1,000 for a yacht for five hours. \"The idea came to me early last year, when I realised that the 'sharing economy' was real,\" says Mr Sentosa, who holds a degree in accounting and finance.\n\n\"A huge tectonic shift was under way, and it would disrupt traditional notions of consumption and ownership. It was around that time that Airbnb, one of the pioneers in the space, was beginning to see significant traction.\n\n\"That's when it hit me - if Airbnb allowed people to monetise their living spaces, then what about other spaces that could be used for other purposes? People could discover unique spaces for their events, and venue owners can turn their under-utilised capacity into gold - it's win-win,\" he adds.\n\nSince its launch in September last year, Venuerific has grown to now even offer spaces for rent in Hong Kong and Malaysia. Most of the events booked through their website so far tend to be corporate events such as product launches or office parties, but there have also been birthdays and wedding events.\n\nAs for venue types, what he hopes for in the future is to have more unique private spaces listed on the website such as wine galleries, vacation homes or even private condominiums. But for now, most of their energy is focused on trying to get the word out there that there's a more convenient way to book an event space.\n\n\"In the long-term, our aim is to create a flexible and wide-reaching ecosystem which would touch on every aspect of the events value chain. Part of that strategy will also be to work with other startups in the same space to create an integrated platform. That way, we can be a one-stop event-planning solution. At least, that's my dream,\" says Mr Sentosa.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Plot 44 has a tenure of 20 years and 10 months, and is zoned for Business-2 development.\n\nOng Kah Seng, director at R'ST Research, said that he expects the site to attract between five and 10 bids, and the top bid to be in the range of $85 to $110 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr).\n\n\"It is quite within expectations that this site is triggered for sale in 2014 as it is an optimal size for medium-scale industrialists,\" said Mr Ong. \"Also, there's limited sites around 0.5 ha available in the H2 2014 Industrial Government Land Sales Programme (IGLS) for sale.\"\n\nNicholas Mak, executive director, research and consultancy at SLP International, said that he expects the site to receive a top bid of between $66 and $75 psf ppr.\n\n\"The subject site has been removed from the reserve list of the IGLS programme for H2 2014 which will take effect from July 1. Thus, the party who applied for the subject site to be released for tender probably really wanted to acquire this land parcel.\"\n\nMr Mak said that he expects the site - which is rectangular in shape with dual frontages - to attract between five and eight bidders.\n\nAccording to Mr Ong, the site is ideal for a low-rise single-user factory.\n\n\"(This site is ideal) particularly for industrialists who engage in fairly labour-intensive and pollutive activities given that the space allocated for such use is set to diminish as Singapore moves toward high-tech and value-added industrial activities,\" he noted.\n\nThe public tender for the land parcel is scheduled for end-July with a tender period of six weeks.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This new law primes the consumer to be more aware of his rights over his personal data collected by companies, and how it can be used in any business-to-consumer relationship.\n\nThe first phase of the PDPA came into effect on Jan 2 this year with the Do-Not-Call Registry. Each company should already have in place a system to ensure that individuals who have listed themselves on the registry are not contacted for marketing activities through phone, SMS and fax unless explicit consent has been obtained from the individuals.\n\nThe remaining PDPA rules which govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal data will soon become effective on Wednesday.\n\nComplying with the PDPA\n\nCompliance with the new law should be taken seriously. Besides damage to a company's reputation, any substantiated complaint can attract a fine of up to $1 million or imprisonment.\n\nAccordingly, all Singapore companies should implement measures to comply with their obligations under the new act. Compliance includes implementing effective measures for access and correction requests, obtaining consent for the collection, use and disclosure of personal data and ensuring that the personal data collected is accurate and complete.\n\nSignificantly, whenever and wherever data is transferred outside Singapore, the onus is on the company to ensure that the recipient provides a comparable level of data protection as that afforded to the individual in Singapore under the PDPA.\n\nCompanies also need to appoint a Data Protection Officer to establish, implement, communicate and enforce the company's data protection policies and practices. This includes the important process of receiving and managing complaints. Contact details of the company's Data Protection Officer as well as the company's policies and practices must also be publicly available on request.\n\nWhat should concern the board?\n\nThe board needs to exercise its supervisory powers over management to ensure that it has used reasonable efforts to implement a robust compliance framework for the PDPA and the Do-Not-Call Registry requirements. Developing a stringent framework should serve as a reliable defence against any data protection complaints against the company.\n\nAs a minimum, the board should assess whether the specific statutory obligations set out in the PDPA, including the Do-Not-Call Registry requirements, are met. These include having measures for specific collection, retention and destruction of personal data, the training of employees on data protection matters, and the regular monitoring, reporting and auditing of data protection processes and controls.\n\nCompliance with the PDPA is not just a one-time effort, but an on-going process as the quantity of personal data collected and used will certainly increase.\n\nFuture developments\n\nThe Asia-Pacific region has seen the most rapid development in privacy laws in recent years. In addition to Singapore, both Malaysia and the Philippines recently adopted new data protection regulations. Other countries such as Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand are tightening existing privacy rules and increasing the penalties for non-compliance and/or data breaches.\n\nHowever, for the most part, data privacy rules in the Asia Pacific are less stringent than European Union (EU) standards. The EU is currently considering extending its reach extra-territorially, so that companies processing data of EU citizens will have to comply with the EU's data protection laws, regardless of where those companies are incorporated.\n\nThe importance of a Singapore company implementing a robust PDPA-compliant framework cannot be over-emphasised. Not only is such a framework essential in providing customers and employees with peace of mind that the personal data in the possession and control of the company remains secure, but it also provides the company with the ability to comply with the PDPA and any international data protection laws that may impact the company in the future.\n\nThe writer is a member of the Governing Council of the Singapore Institute of Directors\n\nFor more articles, go to\n\nbtd.sg/BMatters\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 27, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE Suzuki brand doesn't always produce a winner but occasionally, it does manage to roll out a small but clever car. Take, for example, the Wagon R and Swift - a minivan and hatchback respectively - which amply demonstrate the marque's expertise in efficient packaging.\n\nThe Japanese manufacturer has also enjoyed success with the small SUV, like the Jimny and first-generation Vitara. Its latest model, the S-Cross, marks a return to that segment although the model doesn't really look like an SUV nor appear as diminutive.\n\nSuzuki calls the S-Cross a compact crossover. With its inoffensive styling and car-like handling, this COE Category A car looks and drives more like a tall hatchback.\n\nMade in Hungary and aimed primarily at the European market, it has a 1.6-litre naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine to either drive the front wheels or both axles. The four-wheel-drive version, called the Suzuki S-Cross 4WD, features proprietary All-Grip 4WD technology for all-weather, all-terrain performance.\n\nIt offers four driving modes - Auto mode, which is mainly front-wheel-drive to maximise fuel efficiency but switches to all-wheel-drive when slip is detected; Sport, where engine and transmission response are heightened and when more torque is distributed to the rear wheels for improved cornering performance; Snow mode, to enhance traction on snowy or slippery surfaces for optimum stability; and Lock mode, which modifies the ESP electronic stability program and distributes torque to help extricate the car out of snow, mud or sand.\n\nIn normal conditions, the S-Cross behaves just like a Japanese hatchback would except that it feels European, with well-weighted controls and a nice meaty steering.\n\nMaximum torque of 151 Nm is not much but the relatively low kerb weight (about 1,200 kg) and seven-step continuously variable transmission with steering wheel-mounted shift paddles make it a smooth drive. Progress is more than adequate, while engine noise levels are acceptable for this class of car.\n\nThe equipment level is high, with seven airbags, cruise control, auto headlamps, climate control and Bluetooth telephony. A double sliding panoramic sunroof, said to be the world's first, is an option and allows for a very large opening.\n\nAt 4.3 metres long and 1.58 metres tall, with a wheelbase of 2,600 mm, the interior is sufficiently spacious. Because the rear occupants sit upright, head and legroom are good. Boot size is also generous, with 60:40 split rear seats to extend the cargo area and a privacy cover that allows access to the boot from within the cabin.\n\nThe Suzuki brand has maintained a low profile here in recent times. But the S-Cross should help it to revive interest again.\n\nsamuelee@sph.com.sg\n\nSPECS\n\nSuzuki S-Cross 4WD\n\nEngine\n\n1,586cc\n\nTransmission\n\n7-step continuously variable\n\nMax power\n\n118 hp @ 6,000 rpm\n\nMax torque\n\n151 Nm @ 4,400 rpm\n\n0-100 kmh\n\n13.5 secs\n\nTop speed\n\n165 kmh\n\nCO2 emissions\n\n146 g/km\n\nAverage OMV\n\n$21,000\n\nPrice from\n\n$109,900 (with COE)\n\nDistributor\n\nChampion Motors\n\nTel:\n\n6631 1118\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

An average of 3.3 goals per game provides ample evidence of their offensive strength in quick counter-attacks, accurate final passes and decisive finishing.\n\nArjen Robben's mazy runs and clinical finishing offer exciting options to their offensive forays. In-form Robin van Persie seems to revel in his captaincy role with three goals to his credit. Substitutions made during the final group match against Chile bear evidence of the depth at the bench and the uncanny ability of Louis van Gaal to make impactful changes. Their vulnerability on the left side of the defensive third will be tested when faced with stiffer competition. Coping with the publicity and high expectations will be crucial to their progress in this tournament. In Van Gaal, the Dutch has one of the best tutors of uncompromising team discipline and cohesion. His knowledge of the game and ability to manage the egos of the great talent under his watch will be telling.\n\nMexico's progress in the tournament has been impressive too. Unbeaten with two wins and a draw, they have shown excellent organisation in defence and attack. Adopting a 5-3-2 formation with clear emphasis on defensive discipline and allowing the wing backs to provide timely options for playmaker Andres Guardado and the lively attacking duo of Giovani dos Santos and Oribe Peralta have worked well.\n\nIn a commendable 0-0 draw with Brazil, they showed their defensive strength in numbers to thwart several Brazilian attempts at goal. Excellent goalkeeping by Guillermo Ochoa denied the prolific Neymar on at least two occasions. Ochoa will have to be at his best once again. Skipper Rafael Marquez and his men will be tested in set-pieces, penetrating runs from Robben and swift crosses into the six-yard box. Maintaining full concentration will be crucial to their success. The defensive slip that resulted in Croatia securing a consolation goal in their last outing is an example of Mexico's lapse in concentration.\n\nMexico's turnaround on the back of a rocky qualifying campaign owes much to Coach Miguel Herrera inspirational leadership. He has motivated and transformed a tentative team into a confident and disciplined side.

Its latest flash estimate shows that the Overall Singapore Residential Price Index (SRPI) rose 0.8 per cent in May from the revised value for April - after slipping one per cent in April over the previous month.\n\nThe increase marked the first gain for the index after nine consecutive months of declines between August 2013 and April this year. May's flash estimate is down 6.3 per cent from the recent peak in July 2013. Year on year, the May index value is down 6 per cent.\n\nCommenting on the month-on-month appreciation based on the May flash estimate, associate professor Lum Sau Kim of the university's Department of Real Estate said the May indices were \"perhaps boosted in part by the more active sales in the primary market during May\".\n\n\"Going forward, the lower activity that is often the case in June may result in a small dip in the indices.\n\n\"Our general view based on the evidence thus far suggests that the market seems to be moderating slowly, with price levels that are still high due to the strength of holding power of many participants. The effects of newly completing supply have yet to kick in to induce larger price corrections for completed non-landed private homes,\" she added.\n\nSLP International executive director Nicholas Mak too predicted that the Overall SRPI may contract in June. \"Buying demand would be weaker in June due to the school holidays and the World Cup drawing the attention of market participants away from the real estate market,\" he said.\n\nSavills Singapore research head Alan Cheong said that amid current anaemic transaction volumes, data interpretation becomes tricky. Illustrating his point, he said that raw caveats information from the URA Realis system shows the overall average transacted resale price for non-landed private homes fell 6.2 per cent year on year in May 2014. However, if one were to do a finer split by regions and size, the picture changes.\n\n\"For example, take URA's Core Central Region (CCR), which most observers are very negative about. In May, the average transacted resale price for units 70 sq metres and below, actually went up 6.9 per cent year-on-year. It is only for units larger than 70 square metres (753.47 sq ft) that recorded a 5.4 per cent price decline.\n\n\"The same price behaviour is exhibited for the Rest of Central Region and Outside Central Region.\"\n\nIn the face of the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework introduced in June last year, developers have been building smaller units to achieve aggressive per square foot prices. \"The resale market takes its cue from the primary market, ie, resale prices for completed units fare better for smaller units than bigger units,\" he added.\n\n\"Here, we are simply using raw data without subjecting it to more sophisticated data management tools. With developers dynamically reacting to policies like the TDSR framework, today, they are likely to build on average smaller units than they had launched as recently as a year ago. If the policies get tweaked, they will react accordingly. There is no foolproof way for any index to capture the entire dynamics of the market,\" said Mr Cheong.\n\nNUS's flash estimates yesterday showed the SRPI for Central Region (excluding small units of up to 506 sq ft) rose 0.7 per cent month on month in May, after easing 0.1 per cent in April. The latest May flash estimate reflects a 7.5 per cent year-on-year drop.\n\nCentral Region is defined as districts 1-4 (including the financial district and Sentosa Cove) and the traditional prime districts 9, 10 and 11 by the university's Institute of Real Estate Studies, which minted the SRPI series tracking prices of completed private apartments and condos (excluding executive condos).\n\nThe sub-index for Non-Central Region, again excluding small units, rose 0.8 per cent in May after sliding 1.9 per cent in April. The May figure translates to a 5 per cent year-on-year drop.\n\nPrices of small apartments and condo units (up to 506 sq ft) islandwide climbed 0.8 per cent in May - against April's one per cent decrease. Year-on-year, the drop is 3.1 per cent. This is the smallest decrease of the four indices.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The value proposition of Triyard is not in our balance sheet but in our track record,\" said Triyards chief executive Chan Eng Yew in an interview with The Business Times.\n\nIn a landscape fixated with scale and depth, this proprietary-designed workboat is impressive with a vast open deck which can carry up to 250 passengers and three lattice legs that allow it to operate in deeper waters of up to 105 metres and can withstand harsher wind, wave and currents.\n\nIn business speak, it widens the net for Triyards - a firm with a market value of just over $180 million - to capture more clients, predominantly in the oil and gas space. That way, the timing is spot on too.\n\nLiftboats are breaking out of their traditional oil and gas market in the Gulf of Mexico where they are most preferred for shallow-water jobs due to their lower down time and stable elevated work platform, and are gaining a foothold among key operators in other parts of the world.\n\nAccording to Mr Chan, they are becoming popular in West Africa, the Middle East and South-east Asia, the latter two regions being key markets where Triyards is hoping to expand its presence.\n\nIndustry data further sweetens the expectation over a big room for growth. According to a Macquarie Research report last year, the ratio of SEUs to platforms in North America works out to some one to 14 (based on 240 SEUs and 3,257 platforms) whereas in South-east Asia, the Middle East and West Africa, it stands at one to 60 (54 SEUs and 3,266 platforms).\n\nIn short, the market potential in non-traditional markets is huge - some 179 SEUs huge, to be precise.\n\n\"This discrepancy is another thing we are excited about as it would take a lot of SEUs to rebalance the ratio,\" said Mr Chan.\n\nThe self-propelled SEU - they are also known as liftboats or service rigs which are used to support offshore activities, for example, maintenance of oil and gas well platforms - is the seventh unit that Triyards has delivered since 2007.\n\nFor the firm's captains, it is no less significant. The delivery of this vessel marks a rainbow moment for Triyards' long-time former boss Wong Bheet Huan, who stepped down in February from the helm to assume a less active but more advisory role as part of a \"semi-retirement\" plan. The job to build the sophisticated SEU was bagged during his leadership.\n\nIt also sets in motion what Mr Chan himself refers to as his key mandate at the firm since he took over the helm five months ago - to go out there, woo clients and make good on the investments that have been ploughed to fully develop the yards.\n\nThe facility in Houston, which makes cranes, winches and other equipment, is gradually being turned into a distribution spot while a bulk of the fabrication is done in Vietnam - both for its cheap labour and material costs and its strategic proximity to active shipbuilding markets of China and South-east Asia.\n\nThat's a clever move. According to Mr Chan, the firm has enjoyed hefty cost savings of up to 40 per cent by simply doing that.\n\nTo further lift fortunes, Triyards has gone into ship repair, another move that has been fruitful. The firm's order book as at August last year stood at US$217 million.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The June jobs report on Thursday will cap a four-day week into which it feels like \"four weeks\" worth of data has been compressed. Other key reports include pending home sales, the Institute for Supply Management's surveys of both the services and manufacturing sectors and sales reports from major US car manufacturers.\n\nStrategists say that the data has taken on a new urgency now that the extent of the first-quarter slowdown has become clear. Last week, the Commerce Department reported that the economy contracted by 2.9 per cent - a quarterly production rate that would be considered bad, even in a recession.\n\n\"The final number suggests this was more than just a weather-induced slowdown (even) exports were down,\" said Quincy Krosby, investment strategist at Prudential Financial. \"There's still lingering questions as to the underlying strength of the economy. So the market wants to know \"is this economy really growing?\"\n\nThe economy almost certainly rebounded in the second quarter to around 3 per cent, according to most analyses. For stocks to maintain or build on their already relatively rich valuations, the data will need to corroborate with those analyses.\n\nAny signs in the jobs, services or manufacturing data that the economy did not maintain the 3 per cent pace this month will naturally put a dent in the major stock indices, stoking fears that the first-quarter slowdown was not an anomaly. This is intuitive: a slower than expected growth rate means slower than expected corporate profits and that's clearly bad for stocks. On Wall Street, that's called \"bad news is bad news\". This week, however, could be one of those occasions when \"good news is bad news\".\n\nAs illustrated in the minutes from its most recent meeting, the Federal Reserve is already looking beyond the end of its gradual unwinding of stimulus, or \"tapering\", which is due to finish by December. The Fed is now debating when to begin raising interest rates, and, in this context, traders will recoil from data that shows hotter-than-expected growth.\n\nShould the economic data this week surpass economist expectations by too wide a margin, should new jobs this month be far above the 218,000 forecast by economists, for example, stocks could sell off because of how it affects the Fed's rate-hike timetable. The unemployment rate is already out of the danger zone as far as the Fed is concerned.\n\nA pick-up in hiring, which would be consistent with the weekly jobless claims reports, would hint at a relatively tight jobs market in some sectors. When it's easy to find another job, employers have to offer pay raises to hang onto workers. That causes wage inflation, which will quickly translate into price inflation. \"Investors have bid up financial assets, buoyed by expectations that global monetary policy will stay easy for a long time,\" said analysts at brokerage Barclays, in a note to clients.\n\nIf imminent rate hikes are priced into the markets in the next few months, stock and bond investors would \"find it difficult to repeat second-quarter returns,\" the analysts added.\n\nPrices for some goods are already rising largely because of wars affecting some of the globe's most productive oilfields and cornfields.\n\nIraq, the world's third largest oil producer, remains on the brink of civil war, and any further escalation would likely push oil prices through their 2008 record highs. Ukraine, one of the world's biggest grain producers, is at a similar impasse. Food and energy prices will soon hit levels that will crimp consumers' discretionary spending.\n\nHome prices are also rising. While shares of banks, builders and hardware stores have benefited from the recent increase in home prices for now, some analysts fear the housing market could be a victim of its own success. Demand for houses drove up the price, but now high prices may weigh down demand.\n\nAfter receiving some blame for the last bubbles in housing and oil, the Fed could soon react if prices keep rising. Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis president James Bullard has repeatedly warned that the central bank could raise rates as soon as the first quarter next year\n\nTraders could have a \"Goldilocks\" week with data that comes in \"just right\". Like the Three Bears, however, the Fed will eventually spoil the party.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It covers workers at 29 ports from California to Washington state, including major hubs in Los Angeles/Long Beach and Seattle/Tacoma.\n\nRepresentatives for the workers and their employers said they expect container cargo to continue moving until an agreement is reached, but retailers and other business that depend on the ports are still haunted by a costly 2002 shutdown.\n\n\"Folks are nervous about what's going to happen once the contract expires,\" Jonathan Gold, vice-president of supply chain and customs policy for the National Retail Federation, said on Friday. During the months of July through September retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp receive ocean shipments of goods sold during their critical back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons, Mr Gold said.\n\nLabour negotiations at West Coast ports typically extend beyond the contract expiration date. This round of talks could stretch into mid-July, said Wade Gates, spokesman for the Pacific Maritime Association, which represents the port employers. PMA is \"not expecting any\" work interruptions, he said.\n\n\"The negotiators will keep negotiating, the workers will keep working,\" said Craig Merrilees, spokesman for the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which represents most of the affected workers.\n\nA breakdown in negotiations resulted in a 10-day lockout at West Coast ports in 2002. That stoppage was estimated to have cost the US economy US$1 billion a day, said Mr Gold, and disrupted supply chains for six months.\n\nThe National Association of Manufacturers and NRF estimated in a recent report that a 10-day work stoppage at West Coast ports would cost the US economy US$2.1 billion per day and result in the loss of 169,000 jobs.\n\nKey issues in the talks include rising healthcare costs and the use of outside contract labour. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

At its Art Basel VIP booth designed by hotshot designer Mathieu Lehanneur, the 141-year-old watch brand launched the new Audemars Piguet Art Commission, which will support the creation of one major artwork annually by an emerging or mid-career artist.\n\nChief marketing officer Tim Sayler said: \"There are many parallels, links and connections between the world of watchmaking and the world of art. We want to inspire art collectors with our renowned watches ... But looking at it from the other perspective, we also want to be inspired by artists, to have a stimulus, to understand how they think.\"\n\nSource of inspiration\n\nThough the artist will be given free rein to create an artwork of any medium, the company is interested in candidates who look to complex mechanics, technology and science as their source of inspiration.\n\nFor its part, Audemars Piguet will help connect artists to state-of-the-art technology, top craft practitioners, scientific thinkers, research centres or design experts to conceptualise and execute their work.\n\nWorking with guest curator Marc-Olivier Whaler, the artist will unveil the artwork next year which will be displayed at all three Art Basel fairs: Art Basel Hong Kong, Art Basel, and Art Basel Miami Beach.\n\nThough the watch company began partnering the art fair last year, this is the first time it has embarked on a major art commission of this nature.\n\nMr Sayler explained: \"Our brand has proved many times in history that it is bold and innovative in terms of its watchmaking technology and design ... so we're familiar with the avant garde.\"\n\nWatchmakers Jules Louis Audemars and Edward Auguste Piguet founded the company in 1875.\n\nAnd in 1892, they revolutionised watchmaking with the minute repeater, a complex horological feature that allows a watch to tell the time with sound and music.\n\nOther groundbreaking inventions followed, including the full calendar with which the watch can indicate the day of the week, date, month and moon phases; and the dual time function, which lets you keep track of time in two time zones.\n\nIn 1972, the company made the bold choice of launching the world's first luxury sports watch in steel called the Royal Oak, which has been a bestseller for it ever since.\n\nAmong watch collectors, the brand bears a mark of prestige, precision and exclusivity among watch collectors. For one thing, only 35,000 pieces were handmade last year - a very small number compared to other luxury watch brands that sell more than 500,000 pieces a year.\n\nAt Le Brassus, a village in the Vallee de Joux in Switzerland where the brand was born, the media was invited to the Audemars Piguet Museum. Here, there is a vault with precious handwritten records of every watch the company has ever sold. The neatly inscribed details include the model number, the name of the buyer and the country from which he or she came.\n\nSingaporean buyers\n\nThen something amusing happened: museum director Sebastian Vivas opened a book containing the data entries of recent years. And nearly every page shown indicated some four to eight buyers out of the 35 or so listed as being Singaporeans.\n\n\"There's Singapore... Singapore... Singapore,\" said Mr Vivas with a proud smile as he moved his finger down the page.\n\nThe museum showcases 250 watches dating back more than a century, but that will increase to as many as 500 when the museum builds a radical new extension that's shaped like a spiral and partly submerged underground.\n\nIts avant garde design, coupled with the company's growing support of contemporary art, all suggest attempts by the company to recast its image as a cutting-edge global brand.\n\nMr Sayler added: \"We think of Audemars Piguet watches as cultural objects that are steeped in history, innovation and creativity - and that's what Art Basel and art mean to us too.\"\n\nhelmi@sph.com.sg\n\n@HelmiBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Many customers prefer to do business with brands they know and trust.\"\n\nAt the same time, however, a note of caution has crept into the group's view on digital acquisitions, two years after it announced its ambitions for the space.\n\nMs Chua said: \". . . we note that valuations of Internet companies are at record-high levels, and we will remain disciplined about how we acquire new capabilities to build these digital businesses.\"\n\nSingTel made some big-ticket digital purchases through its digital ad firm Amobee this month, scooping up ad-technology firms Adconion for US$209 million excluding debt, and Kontera for US$150 million.\n\nThese deals came out of the S$2 billion kitty SingTel earmarked last year for digital acquisitions running into 2016. Since then, about a quarter of this war chest has been spent.\n\nOn the remuneration front, SingTel's annual report said that for FY2014, its group CEO's pay package blipped up a notch after falling 5.8 per cent in FY2013. Ms Chua earned about $4.71 million in total cash and benefits in FY2014, up 2.2 per cent from $4.61 million in FY2013.\n\nThe bulk of the increase came from the variable bonus component of her pay package, which rose $100,000 to $2.98 million. The variable bonus comprises a performance bonus and a value-sharing bonus, with the latter tied to the economic profit performance of the group.\n\nMs Chua's fixed remuneration remained unchanged year-on-year at about $1.65 million.\n\nThe slight overall increase was not enough to bump up her pay package to FY2012 levels, when she took home $4.89 million in total cash and benefits.\n\nWhere share awards were concerned, she did better year-on-year, having been awarded 102,097 restricted shares and 1,422,663 performance shares for FY2014, up from 98,060 and 1,418,169 in FY2013 respectively.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Both men left the restaurant earlier this month. According to Mr Longworth, the three parties will \"go in three ways\" on the new restaurant, which will operate independently of The Salut Group. Besides its fine-dining flagship, the Salut Group also owns French bistro Chez Petit Salut in Holland Village. It closed its second Chez outlet in the Marina Bay Financial Centre last week.\n\nThe plan to run a more intimate venture was something Mr Longworth and Mr Desfonds have been germinating since December last year, says the former. \"Au Petit Salut is a big restaurant. We've often thought that if we put the same amount of effort as we did at Au Petit Salut into a smaller venture, we could take the food and the whole experience of dining a whole lot further,\" he elaborates.\n\nAu Petit Salut seats 100 in a standalone colonial black-and-white building in Dempsey, while Rhubarb's two-storey shophouse space will seat 30 on the ground floor, and 16 in the private-dining room upstairs.\n\nDoing the groundwork\n\n\"But, we didn't have any financial backers then, just an idea,\" he says. Fortuitously, APS's owner Alice Low-Ang was also looking to open a smaller outlet, so the three started talking. \"You have to be careful who you go into business with. The restaurant industry is not one that is quick to make a profit. With her experience and business knowledge, we believe Alice is the perfect partner for this,\" he says.\n\nOn why he didn't just stay on and open Rhubarb as an outlet within the group, Mr Longworth says: \"Au Petit Salut is what it is, it's been like this for a long time. We wanted to start something from scratch, a platform on which I can really stamp my identity.\"\n\nWhich chef, after all, doesn't dream of opening his own restaurant one day?\n\n\"I never rushed my career. I never took a job for its money. One needs to be patient and work his way up - but this was always the goal, from Day One,\" he elaborates. \"Even as a junior cook, I always had my eye on the next section: when I was working on the prep station, I would look at the fish section, then when I got there, I wanted to get onto the meat section.\"\n\nAfter starting in London's iconic Blueprint Cafe, Mr Longworth built his career on a string of French restaurants such as French brasserie Racine and one Michelin-star Club Gascon before moving to Singapore in 2009. Here, he was the opening head chef of restaurant and wine retail store Oenotheque by Wine Universe at Millenia Walk before moving over to helm Au Petit Salut three years ago. Mr Desfonds, on the other hand, has worked at Michelin star restaurants in Norway, Ireland, Belgium and France and was the restaurant manager at Nicolas le Restaurant before heading the service team at Au Petit Salut for the last three years. Having both lived in Singapore for five years now, Mr Longworth believes that he and Mr Desfonds now \"have a good base to do it ourselves\".\n\n\"You need to understand the local demographics, suppliers, staff, culture and pricing and how you're going to get staff and customers before plunging into a new restaurant,\" he says.\n\nFor instance, instead of building a fully open kitchen with counter seats as current dining trends prescribe, \"which makes conversation difficult for groups of more than two\", only the kitchen \"pass\" will be kept open and visible from every table in the restaurant, says Mr Longworth. The pass is where the food presentation is checked and finalised by the kitchen before it is handed over to the service staff. It is usually manned by the head chef.\n\nAnd though Rhubarb's menu will bear hints of Mr Longworth's classical French training and his love of fruit, he says of his ultimately category-defying cuisine: \"We don't care what the trend is, whether Spanish or Peruvian food is in right now. We don't want to follow trends blindly and be left outdated after they have come and gone.\"\n\nExpect, thus, a small but carefully curated menu that changes as often as possible to give him carte blanche for experimentation. Lunch sets will start at $42 for three courses, while a la carte options will cost from $15 to $30 for starters and $30 to $36 for mains, and degustation menus of $128 and $138 per person. A \"very small selection\" of Au Petit Salut favourites will be brought over, such as his signature pigeon leg and breast served with rhubarb and rose puree and nut-encrusted grapes a la Aussignac (the latter named in honour of his mentor Pascal Aussignac), and a duck confit served with pumpkin, vanilla and honey-roasted pears.\n\nBlack tiles and stainless steel in the kitchen complemented by earthy stone and copper fittings, carpeted floors and rhubarb-hued accents in the dining area will give the half-a-million-dollar outfit a fittingly luxe feel.\n\n\"Ultimately, it's not about being your own boss, but having the freedom to do what you love, then you don't need to find security in anyone or any restaurant group,\" he says.\n\n\"You see so many egos in chefs because they are being backed by large groups. But there's no ego for me in doing this. We work hard to produce a product that hopefully people will be willing to spend their hard-earned money to buy.\n\n\"That, for me, is all the compliment I need.\"\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\n@DebbieYongBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/asian-art-powers-basel", "site_title": "Asian art powers on in Basel", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nAsian art powers on in Basel\n\nArt Basel, the world's biggest art fair, saw greater prominence of Asian art and collectors. By HELMI YUSOF\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Jun 26, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nGALLERISTS described the unexpected throngs of Asian art collectors at this year's Art Basel art fair in words that parallel a military invasion.\n\n\"They came in large numbers on the first day... and it meant really good business for us,\" said Theresa Liang, director of Long March Space.\n\n\"We have Chinese collectors who follow us to every art fair. We'd see them at Art Basel Hong Kong, and then a month later at Art Basel in Basel, and some of them at Art Basel Miami,\" noted Rene Meile, co-director of Galerie Urs Meile, a Swiss-based gallery with a branch in Beijing.\n\nArt Basel, the world's biggest art fair brand, has three editions: Art Basel Hong Kong in May (though it's moving to March from next year), Art Basel in June, and Art Basel Miami Beach in December.\n\nMost prized artworks\n\nBut Art Basel, the original 45-year-old Swiss fair, remains the biggest and most prestigious, with VIP collectors literally elbowing each other on opening day to get their hands on the world's most prized artworks. This year, some 284 galleries from 34 countries were selling US$4 billion worth of art, according to an estimate by insurer AXA Art. Audemars Piguet and UBS, among others, are the fair's partners.\n\nBy the first day, a Jeff Koons sculpture of an inflatable dolphin had sold for US$5 million and a Damien Hirst installation of pharmaceutical drugs titled Nothing Is A Problem For Me went for nearly US$6 million. An Andy Warhol self-portrait was snapped up for US$32 million within the first 15 minutes - possibly the most expensive sale at the fair.\n\nThe Singapore Tyler Print Institute (STPI), the only Singapore and South-east Asian gallery selected to show in Art Basel, sold a large painting by Thai artist Rirkrit Tiravanija for US$80,000, as well as four mid-sized works by him for US$14,000 each - all on the first day.\n\nSTPI's director Emi Eu said: \"We met collectors from Central and South America who are huge fans of his art. It's amazing to imagine his work finding a home in that part of the world. I wish we had brought more of his works here, because we ended up selling everything of his.\" STPI also brought the works of Singapore artist Heman Chong which garnered strong interest among collectors.\n\nTokyo gallery Take Ninagawa sold its entire booth of works by Shinro Ohtake. And Gallery Side 2, another Tokyo gallery, also sold its entire lot of Fumito Urabe's works.\n\nIndeed, the tills for Asian works were ringing more frequently than it had ever done before in Basel. Even though there were only 21 Asian galleries this year compared to last year's 31, the shortfall was made up for by Western galleries showing Asian artworks - some for the first time. Germany's Galerie Lohrl, for instance, dedicated its entire booth to the sculptures of Japan's Katsura Funakoshi. And Switzerland's Galerie Tschudi showed the photographs of Su-Mei Tse in the hope of attracting more Asian collectors - even though Tse is a half-Chinese and half-English artist born and raised in Luxembourg and is really European.\n\nMajor London gallery Victoria Miro placed Yayoi Kusama sculptures and paintings at its entrance, with Sarah Sze's works on the inside. New York's Sean Kelly Gallery and London's Marian Goodman Gallery put a Mariko Mori sculpture and a Yang Fudong photograph respectively at choice locations in their booths to attract the Asian crowd.\n\n\"Let's just say everyone's realised for some time the important role Asian collectors play in the market. Putting Asian artworks outside our stands makes perfect sense ... so we can reel them in,\" said a gallerist, who chose to remain anonymous.\n\nBut Long March Space's Ms Liang said it's not just the Asian collectors who are interested in buying Asian artworks. \"We're seeing the transition among international collectors too. At first, they were drawn to Asian art because of the wonderful things that were happening the Asian art market ... But we are slowly riding out of that period. More collectors are now looking at Asian art because they actually think the art is good.\n\n\"For Asian galleries like us, who have been taking part in art fairs and promoting their artists on the international circuit for years, this is what we've been hoping for all along.\"\n\nJust last month, Asian art collectors hit the headlines for making up a sizeable portion of buyers at Sotheby's and Christie's auctions in New York. Collectors from Hong Kong, China and South Korea, among others, were seen bidding up the Monets, Picassos and Renoirs. At Sotheby's evening sale, Asian money accounted for US$63.9 million worth of sales, which is almost a third of the US$218 million total sales.\n\nAs David Mugrabi, son of the famous art collector Jose Mugrabi who is said to own 800 Warhols, joked: \"Most collectors start off buying art from their own country, and then they start to look at art from other countries too ... When it comes to buying art, the hardest part is buying the first one. Once you get started, it's downhill from there.\"\n\nDefying commerce\n\nTo counter the strongly commercial tone of the fair - which some, especially artists, regard with consternation - Art Basel has always worked hard at creating non-commercial, cultural activities surrounding the fair.\n\nLeading the charge this year was 14 Rooms, a special exhibition featuring the world's most famous performance artists, including Yoko Ono, Marina Abramovic and Tino Sehgal. In 14 rooms, each measuring 15m by 5m, human performers became the artworks, meticulously carrying out the instructions given by the artists.\n\nThe choice of performance art is critical: performance art is often regarded as the least commercial among art forms, because a collector cannot \"own\" a performer, so to speak. Typically, the only things for an art collector to buy are the official photographs, instruction manuals for the performers, or other documents.\n\nBut in 14 Rooms, all visitors (with few exceptions) were barred from taking pictures, making the experience purely ephemeral and phenomenal - and, hence, hard to commodify.\n\nIn Sehgal's room, a male and female performer spoke aloud one word at a time to create complete sentences. But the game took on an unexpectedly competitive and hilarious edge as either party could support or subvert the meaning and direction of the sentence with the addition of one word - such as a \"not\" or \"maybe\". The title of this simple but acerbic work? This Is Competition.\n\nMeanwhile, Ono's room opened to a sign that said: \"Touch.\" Upon entering, one plunged into complete darkness with other visitors. One felt one's way along the walls, bumping into strangers, giggling, apologising, and relying on every other sense other than sight, to find the way out.\n\nIn Chinese artist Xu Zhen's room, a living and breathing performer stayed motionless in mid-fall, inviting onlookers to contemplate the laws of gravity. Meanwhile, in English artist Ed Atkins' room, a man had a constant argument with a talking 3D computer image over who is more \"human\" and useful to society - the man or the intelligent computer generated image (CGI). Now, if the man and his competing CGI were to look at Art Basel's strategy, with its delicate balance of commerce and art, they might realise it's possible to find a win-win solution.\n\nhelmi@sph.com.sg\n\n@HelmiBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/womenomics-mere-talk-japanese-society", "site_title": "Womenomics is mere talk in Japanese society", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nWomenomics is mere talk in Japanese society\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 27, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTokyo\n\nTHE buzzword \"womenomics\" coined by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to describe one element of his \"Abenomics\" policies may have a sexy ring to it, but unfortunately for him, what it has done is draw attention to the sexist nature of male-dominated Japanese society.\n\nHe says that he wishes to make Japan a more woman-friendly society, but this high-sounding sentiment is at odds with the reality of how women are treated at the workplace in Japan, as was made glaringly obvious recently.\n\nThe Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan (FCCJ) in Tokyo this week hosted a press conference by Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly member Ayaka Shiomura, who is at the centre of a furore over sexist remarks flung at her by male members when she dared question the city's policies towards helping young mothers to continue working.\n\nA male member of this prefectural parliament of Tokyo reportedly shouted at her: \"You're the one who should get married as soon as possible!\"\n\nAnother taunted her with a question about whether she was able to have children, prompting raucous laughter among the male councillors. Ms Shiomura was reduced to tears by this bullying, which went viral through 20,000 tweets; 35,000 people signed an online petition calling for the offenders to be punished.\n\nOnly one among several members of Mr Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) thought to have been responsible for the heckling, Akihiro Suzuki, has so far come forward to apologise.\n\nSeiko Noda, who chairs the LDP's general council, is urging Mr Abe to appoint more women to his Cabinet; perhaps only in the glare of national television would these women be safer from insults than are their sisters in the metropolitan assemblies, she said.\n\nBut discrimination and harassment against women is not limited to government institutions, and risks driving young women to jobs overseas - just when Japan needs them most.\n\nI was reminded of this when I moderated a luncheon speech this week at the FCCJ for Keiko Tashiro, who, in 2009, became the first woman to be appointed a board director of securities house Daiwa - quite an achievement for a \"mere\" woman.\n\nIt was no coincidence that she was hired by Daiwa - one of the more progressive Japanese firms when it comes to such issues - in 1986, the year a new equal-opportunity law took effect in Japan.\n\nOne of only a tiny minority of female graduates to find executive employment in Japan's financial industry at the time, she said that she felt very uncomfortable in a male-dominated environment. She escaped it by pursuing an MBA degree at Stanford and then working in Singapore and London for Daiwa.\n\nHer appointment to Daiwa's board was followed in 2011 by that of Junko Nakagawa as chief financial officer of Daiwa's larger rival Nomura Securities, although Ms Nakagawa has since stepped down from the position. But these exceptions only prove the rule that high-level female executive appointments are rare in Japan.\n\nHow does all this sit with womenomics?\n\nThe truth is that Mr Abe appears to be rather more concerned with finding a solution to Japan's demographic problems than he does with gender equality.\n\nThe nation's population is shrinking and the workforce along with it. Only one thing surpasses misogyny in Japan - the dislike of foreigners or gaijin. This makes large-scale immigration taboo.\n\nSo Mr Abe wants to maximise the use of women in the workforce. His New Economic Strategy unveiled this week proposes raising the proportion of women in corporate management from just 7.5 per cent now to 30 per cent by 2020.\n\nBut will this solve Japan's problems at anything other than a numerical level? No, said Ms Tashiro, who now works in the US for Daiwa. She said: \"It's not just about numbers; it's about diversity.\"\n\nOthers have argued along similar lines, saying that a better mix among genders, ages and races from diverse backgrounds would give more stability - along with economic viability - to Japanese business and society in the long run.\n\nMeanwhile, critics say that Mr Abe's drive to get more women into the workplace is at odds with his desire to see Japanese women produce more babies in order to arrest the nation's declining population and stabilise it at around 100 million.\n\nMs Tashiro argued that the reverse is true: women are more likely to work if they have access to good child-care facilities.\n\nBut male-chauvinist Japanese men obviously believe that a woman's place is in the home - and that she should stay there.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Less than three months into his appointment, current chief executive Chris Wei announced on Thursday that he will be joining rival Aviva plc.\n\nBut what are unfortunate events to an insurance company? Great Eastern yesterday told The Business Times that, despite the leadership changes, the business remains on track and in steady hands.\n\nIts spokesman Tan Seck Geok said: \"It is business as usual for us at Great Eastern. Our core business fundamentals remain sound and we are well-placed to build on our good business momentum, helmed by Mr Norman Ip who is no stranger to Great Eastern and has been on the board since 2010.\n\n\"We have in place a strong and dedicated management team in the countries where we operate who are committed to serving our customers and markets with the best insurance services and financial products.\"\n\nMr Ip will assume an executive role until a replacement is found. He became chairman in April after his predecessor Fang Ai Lian chose not to seek re-election.\n\nMs Tan said candidates must be familiar with the industry and share Great Eastern's core values.\n\nMr Wei, who will be Aviva's Asia chairman and chief executive of global life insurance, said he left for personal reasons and to spend more time with his family in Hong Kong. His last day at Great Eastern is Sept 30.\n\nUnder Mr Wei's leadership, Great Eastern was named Life Insurance Company of the Year in 2011 and 2013 by the Asia Insurance Industry Awards.\n\nIn the stock market yesterday, investors took the resignation news in their stride. Great Eastern shares slipped marginally by 0.6 per cent, or 14 cents, to close at $22.06 on Friday.\n\nMajor shareholder OCBC Bank, which holds about 87 per cent of Great Eastern's shares, declined comment.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The two represent what Hauger calls the \"yin and yang\" of her art, and are on display at the UOB Art Gallery until Aug 1.\n\nWhile the \"Mandala\" series was created by pouring paint and rotating the canvas to create unpredictable swirls of colour, the \"Moments\" series is more deliberate, and required the artist to drag and scrape paint across the canvas.\n\nThrough this exhibition, Hauger hopes to be able to show people that she is in fact a serious artist.\n\n\"When I won the prize, I was a very young artist, and everybody knows that. And that was a moment when I said: 'Okay, for now to be taken seriously I have to produce a body of work which is substantial and shows I can do other things.' I'm not a one-hit wonder,\" she says.\n\nAnd Hauger is just the first Painting of the Year artist who will be exhibiting at the 108 square-metre newly refurbished UOB Art Gallery.\n\nThe space, which was originally set aside to display pieces from UOB's own art collection, will now be reserved for Painting of the Year alumni to showcase their works. This was announced at a closed-door session on Wednesday, when UOB also unveiled details of this year's competition.\n\nOne major change is that the entry period has been doubled from the original two months, lasting from now until Oct 12. Aside from that, the competition will remain the same as last year, after the new categories for emerging and established artists were introduced.\n\nWhen asked what she would be looking out for in this year's winner, one of the judges, Bridget Tan, says she hopes to see relevance and emotion.\n\n\"I think the first thing to say is in general at any one time there is no single standard as to what would be a winning work,\" says Ms Tan, who is the director of the Institute of Southeast Asian Arts at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts.\n\n\"It's always a consensus of the moment and that is largely determined by the profiles of the individual judges. But what I would look for would be something that is of its time. . . And I think emotion is important too. One of the things we overlook in contemporary art is the emotional aspect. These two things are important,\" she says.\n\nNew Horizons' runs at the UOB Art Gallery at the lobby of UOB Plaza One from Monday to Friday, 9am to 6.30pm, and on Saturday, 9am to 2pm.

The 12 million placement shares represent 16 per cent of the enlarged share capital of 75 million shares of IPS Securex.\n\nAt $0.35 per share, the placement is priced at a price earnings ratio of 13 times based on the group's historical earnings per share of 2.7 cents for the financial year ended June 30, 2013, and pre-placement share capital of 63 million shares.\n\nCommenting on the IPO, Kelvin Lim, executive director and chief executive officer of IPS Securex, said: \"We hope our listing on Catalist will not only enhance the public image of our group locally and overseas, and open up more business opportunities, but will also help to attract and retain talent.\"\n\nThe group said that over the last 14 years, its business in Singapore and the region has been driven by its ability to be a one-stop security solutions provider. Mr Lim added that the company is well-positioned to expand its business both in Singapore and Asia-Pacific, \"where demand for security products and solutions has risen since the events of 9-11\".\n\nUnited Overseas Bank is the sponsor, issue manager and placement agent of the IPO.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Electronics production fell 7.5 per cent year-on-year in May; the semiconductors, computer peripherals, and data storage segments fell 6.4 per cent, 11.8 per cent, and 29.2 per cent respectively.\n\nOutput of all other clusters rose, except general manufacturing industries which fell 1.1 per cent.\n\nEDB said that after adjusting for seasonal factors, industrial production contracted 5.7 per cent month-on-month in May - far larger than forecasters' expectations of a 0.6 per cent decline. Excluding biomedical manufacturing, output would have increased 0.4 per cent.\n\nEconomists were expecting the hit to electronics production, given EDB's April report which stated that a \"one-off\" and \"firm-specific factor\" will cause a \"decline . . . in year-on-year growth for the rest of the year\" in the semiconductors segment.\n\nBut while economists have been forewarned of the contraction in semiconductor output, they are still trying to figure out the magnitude of the impact - especially since EDB has continued to decline to share the name of the company, the specific reasons for the output fall, and the nature of the company's operations, citing company confidentiality reasons.\n\n\"Add to that the volatility of the biomedical cluster - sure susah lah,\" said CIMB economist Song Seng Wun, using a Malay term to describe the challenging situation. Indeed, the pull-back in biomedical manufacturing - which posted double-digit expansions in February, March\n\nand April - resulted in a \"double-whammy\" effect on overall factory output, and caught most off-guard.\n\nThe latest data has turned economists more pessimistic about Singapore's growth prospects not just for Q2, but for 2014 as a whole.\n\nUOB economist Francis Tan has revised his full-year industrial production forecast down to 3.5 per cent from 5 per cent previously; his Q2 GDP growth forecast of 4 per cent could also \"potentially be downgraded\" to 3.1 per cent. The government is expected to release its advance Q2 GDP estimates by mid-July.\n\nWhile Mr Tan and ANZ economist Daniel Wilson are waiting \"a few more months\" to get a clearer picture of electronics' (and therefore manufacturing's) performance, they agree that 2014 GDP growth will likely come under last year's 3.9 per cent expansion.\n\nCIMB's Mr Song has tempered his initial expectations of 4.3 per cent economic growth to 3.8 per cent; Citi economist Kit Wei Zheng sees \"small downside risks\" to his 3.5 per cent forecast for 2014, although growth above 3 per cent remains \"possible\" in his view.\n\nSeveral economists also flagged the increasing downside risk to the long-awaited export-led recovery in the second half of this year. Mr Song said that this is especially \"with the return of geopolitical risks from the unfolding civil war in Iraq, (which has been) pushing up oil prices and pushing down consumer confidence\".\n\nStill, other economists such as Barclays's Leong Wai Ho and OCBC's Selena Ling remain sanguine about the manufacturing sector here; the former \"continues to see room for a recovery in (the electronics) sector as the US investment cycle gathers steam\".\n\nAdded Ms Ling: \"This marks a breather in Q2 manufacturing growth momentum, but should not detract from the steady but stable GDP growth trajectory expected for Singapore for the year as a whole.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Familiar pop oldies such as hits from The Carpenters and tunes from classic Hong Kong television series such as The Bund are just some of the tunes that can be heard at Songs Our Parents Love.\n\nThe concert also features collaborations with homegrown talents Lindy Chia and George Chan, who will be performing in Mandarin, Hokkien and Cantonese.\n\nDeciding on the songs was no walk in the park though conductor Adrian Chiang says that the hardest thing for him and arranger Ong Jiin Joo was deciding what should go into the programme.\n\n\"We have all listened to our parents' music when we were young,\" he says, \"While we may not have understood many of the songs then, listening to them now gives us a stronger sense of nostalgia, and helps us understand why our parents loved them.\"\n\nTo pick the songs, they decided to get advice from the target audience as well as turning to their parents and other older relatives for recommendations and stories.\n\n\"Some of the pieces, like Ballade Pour Adeline Matsuri and Music Box Dancer, convinced my mother to race against her peers to have her son learn the piano,\" recalls Ong. The memories related to the music, however, are not confined to the pioneer generation. \"One of the pieces, Country Roads, was a must-sing during my primary school scout camping trips,\" he adds.\n\nThe audience can also rest assured that most of the pieces are symphonic interpretations that are close to the originals. \"We want to showcase the versatility of the wind band sound, but at the same time, we wanted the audience to recognise the music as they heard it 30 to 40 years ago,\" says Ong.\n\n'Songs Our Parents Love' will be held this Sunday at the Esplanade Concert Hall, at 5pm.

Should the month-long event run its course without any major hiccups, and should the host nation eventually go on to lift the famous trophy on July 13, these twin successes could well make the difference in whether Ms Rousseff gets re-elected later this year. Last week, the 66-year-old, the first female president in Brazil's history, was officially endorsed by the governing Workers Party to run for a second four-year term in October. While she has promised to boost social policies and invest more heavily in housing, education and public health, Ms Rousseff still faces a barrage of criticism over the billions of dollars that Brazil has spent on this year's World Cup and the Olympic Games to be held in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.\n\nThere is still much unhappiness surrounding the organisation of the World Cup, with protesters demanding answers as to how the budget swelled to reach US$11 billion. More than a million people took to the streets last year during the Confederations Cup, a World Cup warm-up event, to argue that the money could have been better spent on improving public services. In the weeks leading up to the tournament, there were more strikes and violent protests. The discontent comes at a time when Brazil's once red-hot economy has slowed down significantly - gross domestic product is expected to grow by just 1.6 per cent in 2014. Ms Rousseff, however, has resolutely maintained that all the investments made in areas such as transport and infrastructure will continue to benefit Brazilians long after the tournament is over.\n\nWhen the World Cup eventually kicked off on June 12, Ms Rousseff, who was present for the opening ceremony and the first match between Brazil and Croatia, was greeted with boos every time her image was flashed on the big TV screens around the stadium. But for all the criticism hurled at her, it is telling that she still leads her rivals ahead of the Oct 5 election. One poll conducted last week found that 39 per cent of voters support her candidacy, against just 20 per cent for her main opponent Aecio Neves. If no single candidate gets more than 50 per cent of the votes, there will be a run-off on Oct 26.\n\nWith Brazil doing well in the World Cup so far - the team went undefeated in the group stage and cruised into the second round - the protest movement has lost some steam of late. While there are still crowds gathering in various cities, the numbers are dwindling. The upcoming election is a crucial one, with the Workers Party facing its biggest electoral challenge since former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva came to power back in 2002. Ms Rousseff knows exactly what's at stake. Even with her seemingly comfortable lead in the polls, a trouble-free World Cup, capped off by a Brazil triumph, would mean much less ammunition for her opponents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Originally meant to be recorded in Jamaica until political unrest forced the session to be moved to France where it was made in just two weeks, it has become a milestone record for the pop singer and his most commercially successful ever, with over 30 million copies sold worldwide.\n\nBoasting a handful of John's classics including the title track, Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting, Candle in the Wind and Bennie and the Jets, the 17-track double-album has recently been reissued in various editions including a multi-disc deluxe box set to mark its 40th anniversary.\n\nOverseeing it all is Peter Asher, himself a huge pop-star in the sixties and one-half of the folk group Peter and Gordon, before moving to work behind-the-scenes in the music industry as a label head and record producer.\n\nOver the phone from Los Angeles, he states that the intention of the re-release was not to make a classic album sound better.\n\n\"Instead I saw it as an opportunity to re-approach the songs everybody already knew and love,\" clarifies Asher. \"But at the same time it was also very intimidating. I said to Elton: 'I don't want anyone to think that I could improve upon anything you, Bernie (Taupin, the lyricist who is John's regular songwriting partner) and Gus Dudgeon (Goodbye Yellow Brick Road's original producer) have created all those years ago.'\"\n\nHe adds that even with modern recording and remixing technology, there was no way to catch a better drum sound than what Dudgeon had already captured on tape four decades ago - \"I used all the brilliant new stuff but that doesn't necessarily make things better because there were amazingly good records made back then by completely different methods.\"\n\nThe goal of the anniversary edition, instead, was to present the songs again in such a way that it reminds the listeners of the pure songwriting genius beneath the critically acclaimed album with rarities like unreleased demos and alternate mixes - including an acoustic version of Candle in the Wind - giving fans the opportunity to listen to Goodbye Yellow Brick Road like it was new.\n\nA bonus disc features nine contemporary music acts like Ed Sheeran, Imelda May and Fall Out Boy covering classic tracks like Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting and Bennie and the Jets. It's likely to draw a new generation of fans to discover for themselves the influence Goodbye Yellow Brick Road had on the history of pop music.\n\nAsher reveals glam rockers Muse was one of the acts he would have liked to cover the album's epic 11-minute-plus opener, Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding, if not for a conflict in their touring schedule. But he thinks nothing of the missed opportunity because he is already looking ahead to the record's golden jubilee in a decade's time. \"There are still eight songs remaining and a lot of great people left to do them!\" he laughs.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Crew members unknowingly disabled the auto-throttle, which they thought would keep them from flying too slowly, because they gave multiple instructions to the autopilot during the approach and failed to follow airline procedures in the sequence of instructions and in saying aloud what they were doing.\n\nAnd despite the fact that the pilot in command had raised the nose to a highly abnormal attitude to slow his too-rapid descent - a cue that the plane was too slow - none of the three pilots in the cockpit reacted until it was too late.\n\nThe chief of the safety board's operations group, Capt Roger Cox, said that the pilot \"needed more active coaching\".\n\n\"He showed poor awareness of altitude and airspeed,\" Capt Cox said. But in the other seat, where the co-pilot usually sits, was a second captain, who was training the pilot in charge, he said. The flight was his first as a solo trainer, and he did not intervene. The crew was counting on the auto-throttle to keep the big plane's speed in a safe range, investigators said.\n\nBut Robert Sumwalt, a member of the safety board and a former airline pilot, said that many airline pilots and even some instructors did not understand when the auto-throttle would work and when it would not.\n\nThree young women among the 291 passengers were killed; one of them was left for dead by firefighters and inadvertently run over by two emergency vehicles, according to the investigators.\n\nWhile more than 80 per cent of the passengers escaped with minor or no injuries, all four of the flight attendants in the rear galley were pulled from the plane when the tail broke off; two more were trapped by emergency slide rafts that inflated because the force of the impact damaged their trigger mechanisms.\n\nSafety board investigators had spotted within the first few hours the factor that they eventually identified as the immediate cause of the crash: The crew had used the autopilot in a way that disabled the automatic throttle, which none of the three pilots in the cockpit realised. And all three, apparently relying on the automatic system, had stopped paying attention to their airspeed.\n\nThe airline, however, tried to broaden the issue and cast some of the responsibility on Boeing's cockpit design.\n\nThe highly automated cockpit gave an alarm when the speed fell too low, but it gave the warning a few seconds too late to be useful. And the fact that the auto-throttle could be disengaged so quietly amounted to a trap for an unwary crew, the airline said.\n\nThe crash raised broader questions about whether crews were over-relying on automation, to the detriment of safety. And investigators said that some of the automation could be improved, to give warnings in a more timely way.\n\nAnother broader issue is jet lag. The plane was landing in midday in San Francisco, but it was 3.30 am in South Korea, perhaps reducing the crew's attention to detail.\n\nThe Asiana crash was the first fatal passenger airline accident in the US in more than four years.\n\nThe board is also looking into a host of smaller safety problems, and certainly the system still shows evidence of unsafe actions. In January, a Southwest Airlines 737 landed 737 at the wrong airport. Such mistakes raise the threat of a collision with other aircraft, among other problems. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Instead, within a few months of \"soul-searching\", he found himself itching to dive back into the startup industry with a brand new venture.\n\n\"An idea came to me when I needed to make more money while I was unemployed and tried looking for freelance photography jobs,\" says Mr Chong. \"I realised the industry is so hard to get into as a newcomer, because it's intensely competitive and hard to get noticed, unless you have a reputation.\"\n\nSo that's when he came up with the idea for AirClick.co - a website that allows freelance creative professionals such as photographers and videographers to post their portfolios for potential clients to browse through via a uniform platform. Consumers can find details such as per-hour rates for each photographer, package prices for specific events such as weddings and birthday parties, or even the specific equipment that the photographer carries.\n\nHe adds: \"I had talked to a few friends who had nightmarish experiences as customers trying to find the right photographer for weddings, and I soon realised that if I could connect the dots and make it easier for professionals to find more jobs across a wider network, as well as for customers to have a more convenient way of finding the right photographer, I just might have a business.\"\n\nTo put a profile up on AirClick is free, because Mr Chong only makes money by charging a commission whenever transactions are completed; and just like the Airbnb model, transactions are finalised only 14 days after the actual event to help protect the customer.\n\nPrices are determined by each individual photographer and currently ranges from about $75 to more than $250 per hour. Over 30 available hands are available for hire since the website was launched earlier this month - and this number is gradually increasing.\n\nSays Mr Chong: \"We are trying to change an industry which has seen very little innovation over the last 10 years in terms of finding new customers.\n\nTraditional classifieds and forums are inefficient, time-consuming and laborious, so I see myself soon having to pick up the phone and manually call from a directory of professionals to convert them one by one.\"\n\nAnd while he grows the database of photographers, he also promises to grow the community of potential clients as well, by putting his life's savings into various marketing channels. \"One of the many things I share in common with other creative professionals is this belief - what good is a beautiful image, artwork, video or website if you don't have an audience to show it to? I want to be able to give them that audience,\" he adds.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There are a lot of small businesses - no dominant players in this business, we're one of the larger guys - and a lot of the people who started this industry and who are still in business are in their early 60s or late 60s and have no exit plan, no retirement plan.\n\n\"And it's our goal to be their retirement plan by acquiring the businesses that will grow our business in the right areas.\"\n\nThe AIM initial public offering was priced just shy of the mid-range of early indications yesterday. Global Invacom will raise US$15 million by issuing 44.6 million new shares at 19.75 pence (42 Singapore cents) apiece after talking the deal at 35-60 Singapore cents.\n\nMr Taylor expects the listing to take place within the next couple of weeks.\n\nThe IPO price is a 16 per cent discount to yesterday's closing stock price of 50 cents.\n\nBased on Global Invacom's 2013 net earnings of US$8 million and its May 26 issued share capital of 231.8 million shares, the listing will dilute earnings per share from 3.46 US cents to 2.91 US cents.\n\nThe company gained listed status in Singapore in 2012 through a reverse takeover deal with the Radiance Group. Recalling that the Radiance backdoor listing was \"tremendously difficult\", Mr Taylor said the marketing for the London IPO was considerably easier and drew strong interest from institutional investors.\n\nHe said: \"Technology probably isn't the flavour of the month in Singapore, but it is in London. They've kind of had a renaissance in technology and so, right now, that's the best place to raise money.\"\n\nGlobal Invacom plans to use US$7.6 million of the proceeds for expansion, and the rest for working capital and listing expenses.\n\nMr Taylor said Global Invacom is looking at 36 potential acquisition targets, with about five \"hot\" candidates that could become reality soon.\n\nHe expects acquisitions to be the main focus for the next 1-2 years, after which the company may consider formalising a dividend policy.\n\nDish manufacturing in the United States and anything along the supply chain in South America and India are the current acquisition priorities, he added.\n\nMr Taylor is upbeat about an industry that he described as \"growing like gangbusters\". The company swung into profitability last year, with an US$8 million net profit from US$116 million of revenue; it paid a dividend and expects to do so again this year.\n\n\"There's nobody in our space that's more than US$150 million, US$170 million of sales a year,\" he said. \"By acquisition and organic growth, we're going to be pretty close to that this year, and I can see how we can exceed that easily. So we will become the leading player within the next few years.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The developer plans to add about 10 to 13 hotels to its portfolio, Mr Takahashi said.\n\nOccupancy rates for city hotels across Japan rose for a second year to 75 per cent in 2013, according to the Japan Tourism Agency. Tokyo hotels had an occupancy rate of 83 per cent during the July to September period last year, according to the agency.\n\nShares of Hulic have more than tripled in the past two years, making the company the best performer among the 45 members that make up the Topix Real Estate Index after Sun Frontier Fudosan.\n\nThe stock closed 2 per cent higher at 1,384 yen in Tokyo, trimming its year-to-date decline to 11 per cent, compared with the 14 per cent drop by the industry measure. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

All third-party tenants - which include NEC and American Express - will be assigned to A-Reit. The 10-\n\nstorey building at Kallang Industrial Estate will have an occupancy rate of 83.9 per cent. Hyflux will provide rental support for the remaining vacant space for three years.\n\nHyflux plans to use the proceeds to buy new technology and investments in research and development; expand and automate its membrane manufacturing operations in Tuas Hub; and fund its infrastructure project tenders.\n\n\"The sale and lease-back transaction is part of our capital recycling strategy to enhance the efficiency of our balance sheet and to redeploy capital for strategic investments. Hyflux Innovation Centre will continue to be the nerve centre of our global operations, and we intend to remain at Hyflux Innovation Centre for the long term,\" Hyflux executive chairman and group CEO, Olivia Lum, said.\n\nBuyer A-Reit will pay JTC an upfront land premium of $21.2 million for the remaining land lease of the first 30-year term on the assignment of the land lease. The property is a JTC estate, with lease expiring in December 2068.\n\nA-Reit expects the purchase to generate a net property income yield of about 6.98 per cent, post acquisition costs, in the first year. The annualised pro-forma financial effect of the acquisition on distribution per unit would be around 0.118 cent per unit for the financial year ended March 31, 2014, assuming that A-Reit had bought and operated the property for the whole of fiscal 2014. It also assumes that the purchase was funded by 60 per cent equity and 40 per cent debt.\n\nAn A-Reit spokesman told BT that the acquisition will be funded by existing debt facilities and will push A-Reit's gearing up 1.5 percentage points to 31.5 per cent.\n\nThe property, sitting on a 17,374 sq m site, was earlier valued at $197 million, inclusive of land premium payable, by DTZ Debenham Tie Leung (SEA) Pte Ltd.\n\nFollowing the purchase, A-Reit's weighted average lease term to expiry is expected to increase from 3.85 years to 3.96 years. Analysts are comfortable with A-Reit's acquisition and gearing as it solidifies its position within the industrial Reit space. It will own a total of 103 properties in Singapore and two business park properties in China. A-Reit was trading around $2.30 a share yesterday.\n\nThe sale is Hyflux's second divestment in recent months. It had sold its 49 per cent interest in Marmon Hyflux Investments Pte Ltd for about $8.5 million in March.\n\nAnalysts say that the $84 million divestment gain will significantly boost Hyflux's bottom line, and add nine cents to Hyflux's share price valuation. Hyflux was trading around $1.20 a share yesterday.\n\nBut they warn that Hyflux's core operations remain weak this year due to a lack of projects and new wins. Without disposal gains, analysts say that Hyflux may incur a net loss of about $5 million.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There were just five transactions altogether this year, and none in the months of February, March and May.\n\nOf the 31 transactions in the past year, profitability analysis could not be done for seven because caveats, which include information on purchase prices, were not lodged for the units. Profitability is calculated by subtracting purchase prices from selling prices. Of the remaining 24 transactions, 10 resold at a loss.\n\nAmong the loss-making transactions, four were units at The Berth, the debut project at the Cove which was launched in 2004 and completed in 2006. Three units made losses at The Oceanfront, two at the Coast, and one at the Azure.\n\nTwo in particular made seven-digit losses. A 2,982 sq ft unit at The Oceanfront sold for $5.65 million ($1,895 psf) in November last year, after it was purchased in April 2008 for $7.2 million ($2,415 psf) - a $1.55 million loss.\n\nAnother 2,820 sq ft unit at The Coast sold for $4.8 million ($1,702 psf) in January this year, two years after it was purchased at $6 million ($2,128 psf). This was a $1.2 million loss.\n\nSLP International executive director Nicholas Mak suggests that this could be due to owners struggling to find tenants for their units amid the weak leasing market. Some may also not be able to secure high enough rental rates to service their loans. (Most Sentosa homes are bought not for own occupation, but as investment.) \"So they may find it a better option to just liquidate,\" he said, adding that the location is also not the most convenient for expats to commute to the mainland for work.\n\nAnother industry watcher added that buyers who bought units at $2,100 psf and above appear to have \"overpaid\". Those who profited from their resale deals mostly bought in at lower psf prices; a handful even got their units at $800, $900-plus psf back in 2006.\n\nMeanwhile, several Sentosa Cove units are also up for sale at auction houses here. A 2,777-sq-ft unit at Turquoise condo, put up for sale by a lender at a Colliers' auction this week, yielded no bids, despite having reduced its opening price to $4 million from its previous $5 million.\n\nTwo Sentosa homes are up for auction by DTZ, both by lenders, one at Turquoise and another at Marina Collection. Another four are for sale by private treaty (akin to private negotiations) by JLL - two at Turquoise and two at Marina Collection.\n\nTypically, banks repossess homes and put them up for auction as part of a repayment structure when delinquent mortgagors (borrowers) are unable to find buyers and dispose of their properties themselves.\n\nJLL's head of auction and sales, Mok Sze Sze, said: \"The owners of the two Turquoise units bought them at $7 million each, which is quite difficult to match in the current market.\n\n\"Auctioning is a good method to garner all interested parties in a room to competitively bid. Potentially, the owner can also expect to get the optimum price because it's a competitive method of sale.\"\n\nMeanwhile, some Sentosa condos such as Cape Royale and The Residences at W have made strategic decisions to lease out their unlaunched units instead, given current soft condo prices on the Cove.\n\nRoaring sales in the waterfront enclave back in 2006-2008 were hit by the financial crisis and had hardly recovered when the private housing market succumbed to successive rounds of cooling measures from 2009. The way Mr Mak sees it: \"For property prices anywhere, what goes up will also come down.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is a very significant change, so perhaps a query was justified.\n\nPrice and volume both played a part in the case of Sinotel Technologies, which was queried on Monday when its shares rose from 5.4 to 6.5 cents, a gain of 1.1 cents or 20 per cent.\n\nAgain, the absolute price is small but the percentage quantum was magnified by the low starting price. Turnover was 1.4 million shares - not high if viewed in isolation but certainly unusual when compared to the previous week's daily average of 32,000. Like Sinotel, a query was arguably warranted.\n\nThe problem is that ever since liquidity started draining out of the local market - and most other emerging markets - following the US Federal Reserve's declaration in May last year to gradually taper its money printing, daily activity on the SGX has shifted heavily towards penny stocks.\n\nThere was a lull between October and around April this year when confidence was shaken by a crash brought on by official investigations into the trading of a few penny stocks, but over the past six to seven weeks, penny interest has made a tentative comeback, possibly because liquidity in blue chips has dried up.\n\nIn addition, an increasing number of retail brokers, having seen their income drop sharply over the past year because of a withdrawal of retail interest, have turned to trading penny stocks to supplement their bottom lines.\n\nAccording to some remisiers, this means coming to work every day, switching on trading terminals and jumping aboard whichever penny stocks happen to be among the day's most actives, regardless of what these might be or if the companies concerned have any fundamentals or announcements to justify the trading.\n\nSince proprietary desks and dealers rarely hold large overnight positions, this means what is in vogue today can be almost totally forgotten tomorrow - volume in Sinotel, for example, may have been 1.4 million on Monday, but it dropped sharply to 113,000 on Tuesday and only 79,000 were done yesterday.\n\nIt is important to note that not all large penny percentage gains draw queries. Scintronix yesterday gained as much as 100 per cent when it rose from 0.1 to an intra-day high of 0.2 cent and Advance SCT gained as much as 50 per cent by advancing 0.1 cent to 0.3 cent. Both were quite rightly not queried by the exchange.\n\nThis suggests that SGX does indeed exercise some judgement when deciding what to query. The question then is whether it should go further and factor in sentiment, prevailing conditions and the likelihood that dealers indulging in speculative rotational plays could be responsible for the sudden interest in some stocks, rather than just rely on percentage gains and/or drastic volume spikes.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The venture, launched in 2011, failed to woo travellers.\n\n\"Rakuten certainly makes sense. They can use Rakuten's platform and they can also carry e-commerce goods,\" said K Ajith, an analyst at brokerage UOB Kay Hian in Singapore \"For AirAsia, it's pretty clear that they won't face much interference in terms of how to run the airline.\"\n\nMr Fernandes declined to comment when asked if AirAsia was planning a venture with Rakuten. The Japanese company in a statement said it had nothing to announce at present.\n\nMr Fernandes and Mr Mikitani will announce the deal on July 1 in Tokyo, the Nikkei business newspaper said. Both men share a passion for sports, with Mr Mikitani's company owning baseball team Rakuten Eagles and Mr Fernandes the major shareholder in British football club Queens Park Rangers.\n\nShares in Rakuten rose 2.9 per cent yesterday, outperforming a 0.2 per cent rise in the broader Tokyo market.\n\nANA blamed AirAsia's first flop on poor marketing and a user-unfriendly website, agreeing a year ago to buy its third of the company. It later rebranded the discount airline, based at Tokyo's Narita Airport, as Vanilla Air.\n\nUnder Japanese law, a local airline joint venture cannot be more than 33.3 per cent owned by a foreign firm.\n\nAt the time, AirAsia's Mr Fernandes said he looked forward to returning to the Japanese market. His new Japanese carrier will be based at Chubu airport in central Japan, media reports said.\n\nDoing so, would give AirAsia access to landing rights unavailable at crowded airports serving Japan's capital.\n\nAirAsia's return would ratchet up competition among Japan's discount carriers. They have struggled to overcome ANA and Japan Airlines, which dominate domestic routes.\n\nThe size of Rakuten's stake in the company was unclear, business magazine Toyo Keizai said on its website, but added that both AirAsia and Rakuten may invest up to a third each, leaving the rest to several Japanese companies. It did not cite any sources.\n\nAn airline stake buy would be the fifth acquisition by Rakuten this year, adding to more than 100 investments since 2000. Its most recent in February was the US$905 million purchase of Viber, a mobile messaging and call service. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/7a50a6ced138885677c1076b3502102e101c3b6fabd46699912ff73c6b8a7b46?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Right move: Rakuten's foray into the airline business could help the online retailer boost its travel website that is already one of Japan's largest. - PHOTO: REUTERS"}]}

So they looked for prominent local curators, partnered Italian publishing company Skira and started releasing these comprehensive pictorial surveys, beginning with Korean Eye in 2010, followed by Indonesian Eye in 2012, Hong Kong Eye in 2013, and Malaysian Eye earlier this year.\n\nTo be sure, these books are not without controversy.\n\nAt the launch of Malaysian Eye earlier this year, there were heated debates on the side among artists over why certain names were selected for the book and others dropped.\n\nBut Mr Ciclitira insists that the selection process is impartial.\n\nHe says: \"What we always do is invite every single gallery in the country to submit the portfolio of works of all their local contemporary artists. And, from there, the panel selects 75 to be featured in the book ... In fact, what's wonderful about our selection process is that we are completely unaware of the politics of the local scene, so we don't play favourites. The selection is done purely on the basis of the submitted portfolios.\"\n\nLocal inflections\n\nThe panel consists of his wife Serenella; Niru Ratnam, the Global Eye Programme director; Nigel Hurst, Saatchi Gallery CEO; and Johnson Chang Tsong-Zung, founder and director of Hanart Gallery.\n\nMr Ratnam explains: \"Speaking very personally, what I look for in contemporary art are the nuances that are inflective of local concerns. Even though the artist might speak the universal language of contemporary art, what sets his or her practice apart from that of artists of other countries are those local inflections. That's exciting to me.\"\n\nhelmi@sph.com.sg\n\n@HelmiBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But naturally, as in any dystopian tale, there are a few rebels - and three elderly folk in the pods take things into their own hands before they are driven half-mad being cooped up in the enclosed space.\n\nThe Chinese play was first staged at Jubilee Hall in 1995, but now gets to be played to a wider audience with Jeremy Tiang's translation into English. New theatre company Pinball Collective first did a reading of the translated play, and will soon be staging it at The Arts House.\n\n\"As theatre in translation becomes more prominent in our multi-lingual society, we feel that work of this nature will grow in importance as it helps create bridges across communities,\" notes Tiang, who has translated five books and a few plays from Chinese.\n\nAnother of his translations will be staged in this double bill. Floating Bones is Quah Sy Ren's Dragon Bone, which is a dream play filled with a collage of memories and impressions. Through the fragmentary images, the play questions the senses and to what or whom one is loyal.\n\nThe two important plays, which haven't been restaged in more than a decade, make their English-language debuts that will reach out to a wider audience.\n\nFor Floathouse 1001 especially, Han's dystopian future envisioned more than 20 years ago has a current resonance, what with the issue of overcrowding and the ageing population of Singapore.\n\nBringing the plays to stage will be director Elina Lim, who brings many years of experience of backstage management to the productions.\n\nIt's the fourth play she's directed since Bedok Reservoir, the first Pinball Collective production three years ago.\n\nThe two plays are dark, she says, but there are also beautiful and funny moments. \"I was initially concerned that both plays would be too dark, but I was really impressed at how much self-discovery and lightness these two pieces had,\" says the degree holder in theatre production from Melbourne's Victorian College of the Arts.\n\nWorking on a translated play, Lim says that she discussed it with the playwrights to get a better idea of what they intended. \"And then we reshaped the script a bit more. When it's a translated play, our concern is whether we bring across what the writer intended, and how accurate we are in portraying the play,\" she adds.\n\nIt helps that Lim does read Mandarin but her directorial process was to devise the play with the actors: Lim Kay Siu, Bridget Lachica, Zachary Ibrahim, Bevin Ng and Elizabeth Sergeant Tan.\n\n\"We'd discuss the ideologies behind the play and the emotional journeys of the characters, but we have to let the play come to its own conclusion. I'd say the plays are evolving during rehearsals and we sometimes come up with something that's more befitting emotionally,\" she shares.\n\nThe plays will also be more physical in nature, says Lim, with two persons in the production who don't have speaking parts but only do movement.\n\nOn influences, Lim says she's a huge fan of how London-based Shunt Collective interacts with the audience, and American dance theatre company Pilobolus.\n\nLocally, she includes the Fingerplayers (for their visual effects) and The Necessary Stage (for their ability to capture the intimate moments and devising plays), while her interest in theatre was sparked in secondary school by drama mentor Jeremiah Choy.\n\nShe moved to directing after a six-month backstage stint with The Lion King, she explains. \"It was apparent to me that the learning curve had stopped for me then, and I didn't want to stay on a show that had reached the height of its development. That's why I started working freelance and set up my own theatre company.\"\n\nLim draws from her years of backstage management, and being the sounding board for directors and dramaturgs. \"Very often, I was their right-hand person and giving them feedback which has refined my decision-making, in that respect,\" she muses.\n\nFloating Bones will be an interesting production to see how she's going to direct two abstract, conceptual plays but with hard-hitting messages.\n\n'Floating Bones', a double bill, will show at various times, from July 4-6 at Play Den, The Arts House. Tickets from $18 are available from The Arts House,\n\nbytes.sg\n\n, or call The Arts House hotline at 6332-6919\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

While Amazon's hardball tactics have been a nightmare for Hachette and its affected authors, other booksellers have smelled opportunity.\n\nBig hit\n\nWith The Silkworm expected to be a big hit - the first Galbraith book, The Cuckoo's Calling, was a No 1 New York Times best-seller - retailers from independent bookstores to giant box chains are looking to exploit the dispute to win back customers who may be frustrated by Amazon's lack of inventory. (An Amazon spokeswoman said that it started selling The Silkworm last Thursday, although it is unclear whether it will have it in stock or there will be shipping delays, as there have been with other Hachette books.)\n\nWal-Mart, especially, is looking to capitalise. In the past few weeks, the retailer has augmented its promotional strategy to give The Silkworm an additional boost. This week, Wal-Mart-sponsored advertisements started appearing on Facebook, promoting heavily discounted books - most visibly The Silkworm - at Wal-Mart. And a few weeks ago, the company sent an e-mail to millions of customers promoting certain Hachette titles. It also displayed those books on its home page, and The Silkworm was featured.\n\n\"We just want to continue to let customers and readers know that they can find Silkworm and other Hachette titles at Wal-Mart,\" said Jaeme Laczkowski, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman.\n\nOn the other end of the bookselling spectrum, Third Place Books in Seattle has been giving 20 per cent off the US$28 list price to customers who pre-order the book from them and has promised to hand-deliver.\n\nOther major booksellers are also eagerly awaiting the arrival of The Silkworm. At Books-A-Million, for example, some Hachette titles are available for up to 40 per cent off, and The Silkworm will be featured prominently at the front of the store for a discount of up to 30 per cent.\n\nThis week, the home page of the iTunes book section has featured a list of e-books available for pre-order for an unusually low price of US$9.99 or less, all of which are Hachette titles, including The Silkworm.\n\nHudson Booksellers, the ubiquitous airport bookstore, has created a Hachette page on its website that includes titles for 30 and 40 per cent off - along with a red downloadable sticker that reads \"I Didn't Buy it on Amazon\". That sticker was first shown on Stephen Colbert's show earlier this month and is also available for download on his website. (Colbert is a Hachette author.)\n\nPromotional push\n\nBarnes & Noble has not adjusted its marketing plan for The Silkworm over the past few weeks - its executives said that they had always planned to give it a full-throated promotional push. Its efforts appear to be paying off.\n\nLast Thursday, the book was ranked No 1 among hardcover titles on the company's website.\n\n\"We've partnered with Hachette and supported JK Rowling from the very beginning,\" Mary Amicucci, vice-president of adult trade books at Barnes & Noble, said in an e-mail. \"We know Silkworm is going to be one of our biggest books of the summer, and have put forth our full marketing assets.\"\n\nSimilarly, Little, Brown, - the publisher of The Silkworm - had ambitious marketing plans in place before the fight with Amazon broke out.\n\nHeather Fain, a marketing executive at Little, Brown, noted that while the inability to pre-order from Amazon could have hurt the book's sales, it also received a big publicity boost from all the attention that it has received because of the dispute. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nLifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}

Trading of FHT securities will begin on July 14.\n\nIt is offering 185.1 million stapled securities at 88 cents each, comprising a placement tranche of 139.6 million stapled securities (which is already more than 21 times subscribed) and a public tranche of 45.5 million stapled securities.\n\nAnother 232.9 million stapled securities will be issued to cornerstone investors including Tong Jinquan, founder of Shanghai-based developer Summit Group; DBS Bank; Malaysia's Fortress Capital Asset Management; Metro Holdings; and Gordon Tang, non-executive director of SingHaiyi Group.\n\nSome $367.9 million is expected to be raised from the IPO and cornerstone investors.\n\nAt listing, FHT will also have a gross debt of about $729 million, comprising $613 million in term loans, $29 million in Japanese yen bonds, $37 million in senior bonds securitised by Westin Kuala Lumpur, and $50 million from a revolving credit facility.\n\nThis translates to an initial gearing ratio of 41.7 per cent. Ms Eu said the\n\nReit-manager will be comfortable with a long-term gearing ratio of 40 per cent.\n\nFHT could have a maximum gearing limit of 60 per cent given its credit rating. Moody's last week assigned a provisional Baa2 to FHT with \"stable\" outlook.\n\nMoody's noted that FHT has a good revenue mix that allows it to enjoy potential upside from the more cyclical hotels segment and have income stability from serviced residences. Most of its assets are located in prime city areas with good connectivity, allowing FHT to attract a good spread of leisure and corporate travellers.\n\nBut FHT \"is constrained by its small asset size relative to its peers\", initial high leverage and exposure to the underlying credit profile of its sponsors FCL and TCC Group, said Moody's analyst Jacintha Poh.\n\nFHT's master lease arrangements for its properties make up half of the total expected rent per annum, according to its prospectus.\n\nMs Eu said that the Reit manager will work with the operators on initiatives to raise revenue, find new revenue sources and improve operating margins.\n\nPost-listing, FHT is committing $26 million to renovate and add new rooms in one of its hotel assets, InterContinental Singapore. Several properties in the initial portfolio have already undergone massive renovations pre-listing. \"This means that the Reit, going forward, will stand to benefit,\" Ms Eu said.\n\nAdditional reporting by\n\nLEE MEIXIAN\n\nleemx@sph.com.sg\n\n@LeeMeixianBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So the employee uses those funds to buy MediShield Life or an Integrated Shield Plan (IP); this reduces what would otherwise be duplication of coverage between the employer's medical benefits and MediShield Life. Portable coverage is also a boon for employees as they continue to be insured even if they switch jobs or retire - which is not the case with employer benefits.\n\nThe National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), responding to the committee's report, believes that portability is the way to go: \"We hope to get more companies on board the Portable Medical Benefits Scheme (PMBS) as a possible way of reducing (potential duplication of medical insurance benefits). Employers should consider taking up portable medical benefits that ride on MediShield Life or provide additional Medisave contributions to help their workers pay for MediShield Life or IP premiums.\"\n\nBut this will be a hard sell with businesses, some of which regard their individual medical benefits as a way to attract and retain talent, said Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry president Thomas Chua.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Singapore partner Woo Shea Leen said the take-up rate of PMBS is low despite tax incentives being available because companies prefer the more cost-effective option of a group plan; switching to portable insurance will cost more at a time when employers are seeking to control expenses.\n\nBut the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) said the committee's recommendations for a standard IP - enabling risk-loaded policies for IP insurers and stronger incentives from the government to entice firms to restructure their medical benefits - represent a \"major breakthrough\" in encouraging the transition to portable medical benefits.\n\n\"For employers, their medical costs would be more predictable and, for workers, they would be able to get better coverage when they are in between jobs and after retirement,\" SNEF said, adding that government incentives to make the switch would be crucial.\n\nStill, a key step will be made next year, with the CPF employer contribution rate rising one percentage point, and the increase to be funnelled towards the employee's Medisave account. A one-year employment credit scheme, under which employers will receive an offset of 0.5 percentage point of wages, will cushion the heavier burden for firms in the first year.\n\nMeanwhile, REACH has set up a microsite to collect views on the MediShield Life recommendations.

He has been with the federation for all of its 12 years, the first six as a council member and the rest as its chairman.\n\nWhile he chooses to remain modest about his contributions, SBF has achieved much under his leadership.\n\nAmong various things, it has forged stronger ties with Singapore's trade associations and chambers; boosted its membership; put in place a strong management team; found a permanent base; helped its members venture to numerous countries; established a committee dedicated to looking after the concerns of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) - which now has a voice even in the Singapore Budget; and launched a foundation that encourages the business community to give back to society.\n\nMr Chew brought much of his own experience to bear, but he is quick to attribute SBF's success to others.\n\n\"I've been fortunate that I have the support and help of so many people, or much of what was achieved might not have been possible.\n\n\"So, having friends is very important,\" he quipped.\n\nSuch friendship and the loyalty of SBF members was won by much hard work - not least the numerous initiatives undertaken by the federation in recent years.\n\nSBF's activities, which include overseas business missions for its members to Asia, Africa and Central and Eastern Europe, have grown from 50 events in its inaugural year to 550 in 2013, attracting some 74,500 participants.\n\nNotable initiatives include the SBF-led SME Committee (SMEC), formed in 2011. The SMEC has gone a long way in advocating the causes of SMEs - bringing their issues and concerns to the attention of the government, so much so that the Ministry of Finance now asks the SMEC for its input on the Budget. In 2013, the ministry included 33 of the recommendations put forth by the SMEC for that year's Budget.\n\nIn addition to about 100 members serving on the SMEC, Mr Chew said many others also provide their time, resources and experience to other initiatives undertaken by SBF.\n\nHe talks about how, for example, five SBF members decided to each donate $1 million to get the NTU-SBF Centre for African Studies started, so that it could be a useful resource for companies thinking of setting up in Africa.\n\n\"And they're not just contributing money; they also serve on the steering committee,\" he pointed out.\n\n\"We also have many members, who are successful businessmen, offering to mentor our SMEs and our young business leaders. Some of the most active mentors include Boustead Singapore's chairman and group CEO Wong Fong Fui.\"\n\nAnd there's Philip Ng, CEO of Far East Organisation, who gifted SBF 22,000 square feet of prime office space on Robinson Road, and named it SBF Centre, so that the federation would have a permanent home.\n\n\"The reason he did so is that he felt the team (at SBF) was making a difference and he wanted to support SBF. On top of it all, he also gave $10 million to seed the SBF Foundation,\" Mr Chew said.\n\nThe SBF Foundation, launched this year, is dear to Mr Chew's heart. It is funded by donations and set up as a separate entity from the federation.\n\n\"The Foundation can go beyond what SBF was originally established for. It can look at creating jobs, creating a conducive as well as a competitive business environment. It looks at how we can encourage businesses to look at helping low-wage workers by upskilling them, training them and so on. And it can also provide opportunities for older workers as well as female workers.\n\n\"This is what we have managed to develop and inculcate: this sense of giving back, of helping others, and not just of competing with each other. This is important, going forward. We hope we can influence young business leaders to do the same in the future,\" Mr Chew says.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/technology/mobile-race-developing-markets", "site_title": "The mobile race in developing markets", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nThe mobile race in developing markets\n\nVserv's CEO tells VICTORIA HO where the key in cashless payments lies\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jun 29, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSOFTWARE makers and advertisers must figure out how to better work with mobile carriers, or they will lose out fast in emerging markets, warned Dippak Khurana, chief executive and co-founder of mobile platform and solutions vendor Vserv.\n\nMobile usage in developing markets continues to surge, though cashless payment modes are still slow to catch up in many parts of the world. And the latter is blocking software makers and advertisers from making inroads into these markets, according to Mr Khurana.\n\nHe told BizIT that because of low credit card penetration rates, most users rely on their pre-paid carrier wallets to transact with mobile apps, or with other users. This stops them from using the central Google Android wallet, or Apple App Store account, and as a workaround, many developers end up selling content through their own app stores instead of going the mainstream route.\n\nFor developers, Mr Khurana said they need to support carrier wallets in order to remove the friction from payment, or users will avoid paying for their content.\n\nAnd for advertisers, he said this leakage from traditional streams is harder to capture and track, making it tougher to figure out where users are spending their money in the region.\n\nOnline reports claim there are about 20 million credit cards and 330 million debit cards circulating in India, which means a penetration rate of just about 30 per cent of the country's 1.2 billion people.\n\nA survey last year by Jana, a mobile advertising platform, revealed similar penetration rate - average 32 per cent - in emerging markets in Asia, South America and Africa.\n\nVserv is an Indian-based mobile advertising network which acts as a middleman between advertisers and app makers. It makes its money through advertisers who pay for the network to carry ad impressions. Developers incorporate Vserv's ads within their apps.\n\nVserv also works with mobile operators to allow them to push ads to end-users, and it has a service allowing operators to offer their own e-wallets for in-app payment. Most of its clients are in India, the Middle East, Africa and South America.\n\nCompanies from developed markets don't understand the differences in behaviour in these locations, Mr Khurana said. They often thought mobile phones to be the \"second screen\" in emerging markets - what users would look at when not on their desktops. This puts the mobile phone as second priority.\n\nBut Mr Khurana said in emerging markets, where many are coming to the Internet via the phone first, mobiles are first screens. \"The proportion of time spent outside the phone, like on the desktop, can be little to zero. They spend their time on the mobile, then television and PCs as a distant third.\"\n\nFor these markets, the proportion of ad expenditure on the mobile compared with other platforms should shift to reflect this behaviour, he said.\n\nMr Khurana said e-commerce platforms should also tweak their products to provide a full experience on the mobile as well, because people are using their phones as the \"first\" screen.\n\nMobile advertising platforms have been introducing services to cater to the largely pre-paid user base in emerging markets. In January, Vserv unveiled an ad format called SmartRewards that tops up users' prepaid accounts in exchange for clicking on ads, or downloading sponsored apps.\n\nIn March, Boston-based Jana released a similar service called Marketplace. This allows advertisers to send mobile ads to users' devices, and users who watch the videos get their mobile accounts credited.\n\nJana launched this service with a 30-day campaign with Unilever.\n\nMr Khurana said mobile advertising is much younger as a medium compared with traditional channels, having been around for just the past four to five years. Advertisers are still experimenting with how best to reach out to users.\n\nSince 2010, when Vserv was started, the addressable user base in emerging markets has grown about five times. Vserv's own reach has tripled in the past 12 months, from 131 million to 421 million, according to Mr Khurana.\n\nAnd the potential for emerging markets continues to grow.\n\nIndia has about 160 million users with data phones, South-east Asia has 120 million, there are 150 million in South American countries such as Mexico and Brazil, and 60 million or so more in the Middle East and Africa. \"If you fast forward another 24 months, roughly 60 per cent of the global data-consuming users will come from these markets,\" Mr Khurana said.\n\nVserv has a staff of 200, mostly based in Mumbai. It has raised about US$6.7 million to date, and is looking to raise another round for its next phase of growth.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A chorus of \"Eliminado!\" You don't have to be a linguist to translate that one and you'd think they'd let us have our self-deprecating fun without rubbing it in!\n\nHowever, what struck my son Daniel and me across the entire trip is that this country truly has an equal, if not higher, claim than anywhere else to be the home of football. At all five games we attended, there were as many Brazilian shirts evident as the teams on the field. At hospitals (flash bout of flu in Sao Paolo!), at airport gates, screens on taxi dashboards (major safety hazard), in bars, restaurants and even on the beach you couldn't escape the games and while the image of protests go out around the world, the feeling here is that the passion and enthusiasm for the game are above anywhere else we've ever experienced.\n\nAt the Maracana, we watched a live feed of the last 16 games and a talented Chile side take the home team to a penalty shootout, and were relieved when the home team scraped through for two reasons. Firstly, we knew elimination of the host nation might radically change the party mood at our upcoming final match pitting a James Rodriguez-inspired Colombia against a Suarez-less Uruguay. Secondly, and selfishly, we wanted the Brazilians to be in the tournament as long as we were here. It's that vital to the continued party atmosphere!\n\nAnd so as I sit here at the airport in front of yet another screen watching Mexico play Holland before boarding, my over-riding thought is this: England went home too early, I am coming home to Singapore to renewed awkward viewing times but football has, in fact, already come home. Putting aside the politics and appropriate use of funds, Brazil deserves the World Cup and the world football community couldn't ask for a more passionate, informed and engaging host!\n\nThank you Brasil for an amazing 12 days !\n\nThe writer is Group CEO, Courts Asia Ltd\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

The bonds will have a five-year maturity and will be privately placed,\" the banker added.\n\nThe Alpha banker said that the money raised would help the bank funnel the liquidity into new loans and support the Greek economy's recovery.\n\nThe deal also represents part of efforts by industry players to seek other ways to raise money to plug a multi-billion dollar funding gap caused by several European banks exiting the shipping sector or scaling back exposure in response to tougher regulations after the financial crisis. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

(Diesel is now sold at RM2 a litre.)\n\nMalaysia has dragged its feet on the implementation of Euro4 and is way behind its neighbours; Thailand is already on Euro4 and Singapore, Euro5.\n\nIf Singapore's implementing the HSU40 ruling gives impetus for the Malaysian government to switch up to a cleaner diesel, it would be a happy development for MAI and car companies in Malaysia, which have long called for cleaner fuel; local motorists have also found themselves locked out of the chance to own the latest vehicle models, which have not been imported into Malaysia because they need higher-grade fuels.\n\nAnother positive effect of the Singapore policy across the Causeway is that companies such as Mercedes Benz and BMW would be more encouraged to make investments in energy-efficient vehicle manufacturing, and so qualify for government incentives.\n\nIn his update on MAI, the International Trade Ministry's policy-forming agency for the automotive sector, Mr Madani said that lorries entering Singapore would, in the interim, use newer vehicles that meet the HSU40 standard. This is possible if a filter is used.\n\nBetween 3,000 and 4,000 Malaysia-registered lorries enter and leave Singapore daily, transporting goods and produce. They each have two fuel tanks, which makes it possible for them to drive from Penang on Euro2, and fill up in Johor with Euro5.\n\nThe HSU40 standard was to have kicked in on Jan 1 this year, but a six-month reprieve was given to diesel-powered vehicle owners to meet the new standard.\n\nJohor Lorry Operators Association president Anthony Tan Boon Fiong had previously noted that Euro4 was to have been implemented in 2011, but has now been pushed back to 2018, when Petronas' new refinery in Pengerang in Johor is expected to be operational.

For accountants, Mr Yong says, this \"is like relearning all the accounting standards from scratch\".\n\n\"For the average accountant and finance professional, keeping up to date with the changes is one challenge,\" he says. \"More importantly, they need to be competent in implementing the changes and understanding new disclosure requirements. The complexity of the changes means that even qualified accountants and their staff will need a structured process for continuing professional development to stay updated. Not exactly an easy task especially when this has to come on top of an already heavy workload.\n\n\"This is one area where CPA Australia is constantly ensuring that we have the relevant professional development programmes to help our members. Our Singapore office organises over 80 CPD events a year, some dealing with these issues for our members in practice and those working in finance functions in MNCs (multinational corporations) and SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises)\".\n\nThe need for continuing professional development is also becoming increasingly important as accountants take on new roles in this changing global economic environment. Chief financial officers (CFOs) and finance directors these days are expected to do much more than just crunch the numbers; they're expected to aid the CEOs in managing the strategic direction of the business and have to be aware of how the different functions in an organisation come together.\n\n\"CPA Australia believes strongly in this with our emphasis on achieving professional qualification and continuing professional development beyond the mere numbers - into practical issues that are relevant for business, finance and accounting. CPAs are now highly regarded as strategic business partners to organisations.\n\n\"The business environment today has also become more complex. A typical organisation is exposed to cross-border conditions through investments, their customers and suppliers and having operations in multiple locations. Technology is also transforming the way they do business. On top of this, a new normal in business has developed following the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, the Sars epidemic in 2003 that slowed many Asian economies, and the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers.\n\n\"This means CPAs have great opportunities to step up and establish themselves as trusted business partners. As a professional body, CPA Australia has been working hard to generate greater awareness about evolving knowledge and capabilities for our members and ensure they remain relevant to organisations,\" Mr Yong says.\n\nIn fact, CPA Australia believes so firmly in the need for its members to keep themselves continually updated that its membership rules state that a member must rack up 120 hours of CPD over a three-year period to keep his CPA status. \"We're among the first professional bodies in the world to insist on this for our members.\"\n\nAnother challenge for accountants is the new forms of financial reports - such as Integrated Reporting, which looks at a business more holistically, reporting on its strategy, governance, performance and prospects, in the context of its external environment, and how this will lead to the creation of value in the short, medium and long term.\n\n\"Integrated Reporting is the new buzzword in financial reporting circles. CPA Australia believes that promoting a sound financial reporting framework will ensure stability in financial and capital markets. Integrated reporting will be a significant part of this in coming years. We continuously support the efforts of companies taking the step towards integrated reporting,\" Mr Yong says.\n\nAnd CPA Australia is putting its money where its mouth is - its latest 2013 annual report out earlier this year is also its first integrated report, and among the first in the world.\n\nRemaining relevant\n\nLooking ahead, Mr Yong says that the professional body's key priority \"is to continue to make a meaningful impact to our members in their careers and the accounting profession, and contribute to Singapore's vision of becoming a global accountancy hub\".\n\n\"We will continue to help CPAs (Certified Practising Accountants) remain at the cutting-edge of business, finance and accounting. Critical to this is to ensure that our professional qualification - the CPA Program - and CPD initiatives are constantly refreshed to meet the evolving demands of the business world.\n\n\"To advance the accounting profession in Singapore, we will also expand our work with a range of stakeholders, including employers, education institutions, university students, government and regulators. In the journey ahead, these important stakeholders will continue to form the bedrock of CPA Australia's collaboration efforts to promote the accounting profession.\"\n\nmichquah@sph.com.sg\n\n@MichelleQuahBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Mr Biden thanked Mr Lee for Singapore's leadership in \"shaping a more peaceful and prosperous South-east Asia\".\n\nThe issue of China's \"destabilising behaviour\" in the South China Sea was also raised.\n\nChina has laid claim to most of the South China Sea, including the waters approaching its neighbours' coastlines, and has been increasingly assertive in staking its claims.\n\nMr Lee and Mr Biden reiterated their mutual interest in international law, freedom of navigation, and the peaceful resolution of maritime and territorial disputes.\n\nThey also spent time discussing the ongoing Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations, which are now in the final stages and look set to be wrapped up later this year.\n\nThey agreed on the importance of successfully concluding the talks in order to achieve an \"ambitious, high-standard deal\" as soon as possible.\n\nMr Obama was quoted as saying last week that he hoped to have an agreement on framing the TPP pact by the time he visits Asia again this November.\n\nDuring Mr Lee's meeting with Ms Rice, they took stock of the strong bilateral relations between their two countries, which extend to the regional and multilateral level.\n\nThey also discussed ways in which US engagement of Asia could be enhanced, including through the TPP.\n\nSeparately, Mr Lee was hosted to tea by Robert Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, together with various Democrat and Republican senators.\n\nHe also met two US lawmakers from the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces to discuss regional strategic and security issues.\n\nWith the Washington leg of his trip complete, the prime minister and his delegation boarded the Acela Express - Amtrak's high-speed rail service along the north-east corridor of the US - for a three-hour journey to New York City.\n\nThis train, one of the fastest in the Americas, can reach a top speed of about 240 kmh.\n\nMr Lee will spend a little over a day in the most populous city in the US before returning home. Besides meetings with business and industry leaders, his itinerary includes gracing a ceremony to officially launch Temasek Holdings' new office in the midtown Manhattan business district.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Chinese telco giant sees the company eventually relying on non-telco business.\n\nAlready, says Huawei's South Pacific president of its enterprise business department, Zhang Hui, the sheer growth of the enterprise revenue points to the enterprise group's big potential.\n\nHuawei's traditional business done with carriers accounted for US$27.5 billion of its total US$39.5 billion shares in the company's 2013 financial results. Sales by the consumer segment contributed US$9.4 billion, while enterprise only US$2.5 billion.\n\nThe company's main business is in making carrier backend equipment such as networking switches and selling mobile and broadband infrastructure software to telco operators. The consumer segment covers handsets and tablets and its enterprise business provides ICT (Infocomm Technology) services to corporations.\n\nBut Huawei's enterprise business is far younger than its traditional carrier business, which has been operating for the past two decades. The company entered the enterprise market only in 2011, targeting industry stalwarts such as Cisco, Juniper Networks and Hewlett-Packard (HP). Since then, Mr Zhang says, the business has been ramping up.\n\nAccording to him, the global enterprise sales shot up 32 per cent last year. For the South Pacific region under his care, that number was 50 per cent.\n\nSouth Pacific for Huawei covers Singapore, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Australia and New Zealand, with Singapore as headquarters.\n\nMr Zhang says the enterprise segment has been driven an insatiable demand for better technology. While enterprise investments in back-end technology are massive, he says they are justified by advances in systems which make business a lot more efficient.\n\nNorman Frisch, director of marketing for enterprise wireless solution sales at Huawei, claims that if the company replaces its existing radio systems like Tetra (Terrestrial Trunked Radio) with the new eLTE system, it can provide better communications for ground staff at airports and public services.\n\nHuawei's sales pitch for eLTE is that its higher bandwidth system is superior to the multiple communication systems. Replacing the latter with eLTE will save manpower and cost.\n\nMr Zhang says Huawei will compete directly with bigger names and older players such as Cisco, IBM and Alcatel-Lucent in the enterprise business. But he's confident that Huawei's heritage in the telco scene can provide crossover advantage, as seen with eLTE, that is based on Huawei's existing intellectual property.\n\n\"The enterprise market has a broader portfolio need, but wireless standards are all the same. In terms of a product portfolio, I feel we have a broader one than Cisco, even,\" Mr Zhang says.\n\nBut competing on technology alone is not the way, because wireless standards have become so established that many products are similar in the market, he says. Instead, the company plans to attack specific verticals within which it has built up existing competencies. \"We want to be a one-stop shop (for those industries). We can compete by making our service better, and making our prices better,\" Mr Zhang says.\n\nHuawei's South Pacific headquarters in Singapore has about 30 people on its staff, and works here mostly through channel partners like systems integrators.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

You have to have policies, measures, specific projects on which you work with the partners in the region where it is win-win, and people say 'Yes, America is a good and worthy friend, and I am on your side'. The TPP is one serious measure which shows the seriousness of your purpose,\" said Mr Lee.\n\nAsia is constantly changing, with China growing and becoming more influential with time, the prime minister noted, adding that it was a region that America played an important role in and had to engage actively.\n\nAnd even as the US was currently preoccupied with foreign policy issues such as the troubles in Iraq, Iran, Syria and Ukraine, Mr Lee reminded the world's largest economy that it had \"many friends, many interests and many investments\" in Asia.\n\nHis other opportunity to press the point came during a reception to mark the 10th anniversary of the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (FTA), at which he said trade policy needed to be a \"key instrument\" in order for the US to engage in the region and to expand its influence and relevance to Asian countries.\n\n\"There has to be substance, and, if I may say, there has to be beef in the hamburger. The TPP is the most important deal on the table, or anywhere on the horizon, in this respect,\" he told guests gathered at the US Chamber of Commerce.\n\nHe also spoke of the importance of the TPP to have strong bipartisan and public support as he urged the American business community to lend their voices to support the deal.\n\nThe TPP, he added, would open up 700,000 new jobs in the US by 2025 - 10 times the projected number to be created under the US-South Korea FTA.\n\nIf realised, the TPP would be the world's largest free-trade pact, covering about 40 per cent of global GDP and a third of world trade.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It may take two to four years (and) the market will be more healthy,\" Mr Wang said.\n\nVanke president Yu Liang recently said the slowdown in China's property market heralds the end of the golden era for Chinese real estate, but said the outlook for the property sector remains healthy.\n\nThe comments came at a time when China's average home prices fell for the first time in two years in May and price weakness spread to more major cities, official data last week showed, adding to signs of a cooling in the property market that poses a risk to the broader economy.\n\nThe company announced in January last year that it would move its foreign-currency B-shares to Hong Kong, becoming the third company to leave the mainland's moribund B-share market in Shenzhen.\n\nThe debut price outperformed its A-shares listed onshore, which were up 0.3 per cent at 8.11 yuan, or about HK$10.15 each.\n\nB-share shareholders, including China Resources Corp, Singapore's GIC and Asian asset manager Value Partners, were offered a conversion price of HK$12.39.\n\nVanke's H-shares account for 11.9 per cent of total outstanding shares. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM\n\nUK homebuyer demand rebounds to a six-month high, index shows\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:30 AM", "images": []}

The showflat was closed this week but will open again tomorrow for this weekend's sales.\n\nSo far one tower has been released, comprising around 130 units, say sources.\n\nThe average price for the 99-year leasehold project is believed to be in the region of $1,750-1,800 per square foot before reimbursement of up to 7 per cent for additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD). The reimbursement will be made upon buyers showing proof of the ABSD payment. This means the effective price to Wing Tai would be lower, at $1,628-1,674 psf assuming the maximum 7 per cent ABSD refund on all units.\n\nLocated near Jervois Road and the Chatsworth Park Good Class Bungalow Area, the project comprises 469 units in one- to five-bedroom configurations. The Toyo Ito-designed project, which is about 450 metres from Redhill MRT Station, has three 23-storey tower blocks and four low-rise blocks (each five storeys high).\n\nUnits are spacious, generally at least 15-20 per cent larger than the current market norm, say market watchers. For instance, one-bedroom apartments at The Crest average around 650 sq ft, compared with around 440-540 sq ft in most projects these days. The Crest's typical two-bedroom apartments are said to be around 800-900 sq ft, again bigger compared with around 580-700 sq ft in most projects.\n\nWing Tai is developing The Crest together with retail and property group Metro, and UE E&C's unit Maxdin.\n\nThe trio paid $960.28 per square foot per plot ratio for the site at a state tender that closed in September 2012. In April this year, the next door site was sold 14.5 per cent lower, at $820.65 psf ppr to a UOL-Kheng Leong partnership.\n\nThe first weekend sales result at The Crest contrasts sharply with that of Commonwealth Towers, where 175 units were sold on its first day of sale (up to 8pm), on May 1. The 99-year project, next to Queenstown MRT Station, has one- to four-bedroom units ranging from 441 sq ft to 1,302 sq ft. The project's developers moved 275 units for the whole of last month at a median price of $1,626 psf, according to developers' sales stats for May released by Urban Redevelopment Authority.\n\nMarket watchers say the difference in outcome between the two projects is due to the bigger lump sum quantum for The Crest arising from its units being larger. A typical one-bedder at the project costs $1-1.2 million.\n\nIn contrast one bedders (441 to 484 sq ft) at Commonwealth Towers are available at between $750,000 and $850,000.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So the US Federal Reserve is in no hurry to raise rates from near zero, even as it moves towards the end of quantitative easing (QE).\"\n\nWall Street last week rallied to new highs after the Fed's latest Open Market Committee meeting, at which it said \"a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy\" is still appropriate, and that interest rates will stay unchanged \"for a considerable time\" after the QE stimulus ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below 2 per cent.\n\nApart from the Fed, Mr Lim also highlighted the monetary accommodation by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, while also pointing out that China's economic growth rate appears to be bottoming out and that India's new business-friendly government has inspired renewed confidence.\n\n\"This is not a typical environment for a bear market,\" said Mr Lim, adding that even if it was, it would be useful to differentiate between markets. His analysis shows that the Shiller cyclically-adjusted price-earnings multiple for US stocks at 25 is near its 2007 level, that complacency is high and that US equities are in a \"grey area between greed and fear\".\n\nAs a result, the recommendation is to take on more weight in Asia ex-Japan and emerging markets.\n\n\"The battle between bulls and bears in the emerging markets and Asia ex-Japan has been intensifying over the past year, with the bulls buying the dips higher and bears selling the rebounds lower,\" said Mr Lim.\n\n\"Something has to give. Given Asia's superior fundamentals we would be inclined to bet on a breakout in favour of the region's equities. And with that, a rotation in the leadership of the equities bull market.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Google opened a data centre in Hamina, Finland, in 2011, while Facebook started its first overseas server in Luleaa, Sweden, last year.\n\nStreaming services for movies, pictures and data are set to double global demand for server halls, requiring more than 500 terawatt-hours of power by 2025, or almost as much as Germany's annual demand, according to Vattenfall. Energy use in Southeast Asia alone is expected to increase 80 per cent by 2035, International Energy Agency (IEA) data shows.\n\n\"Local versions of YouTube, Google and Facebook exist in almost all Asian countries where English is not the major language,\" Mr Almen said in the interview. \"With large populations and a strained power situation, these players will start to look for solutions in other places.\"\n\nCompanies in need of more capacity are looking towards Nordic countries, attracted by a stable power grid as well as the chilly climate to keep equipment cool. With plans for more nuclear and wind generation, the region's electricity surplus is expected to reach a record 50 terawatt-hours in 2025, or 13 per cent of annual demand, according to Markedskraft AS, an analysis firm based in Arendal, Norway.\n\nYandex NV, Russia's largest search engine, will open a data centre 60 kilometres from Helsinki this year, according to the Invest in Finland, a government agency that assists foreign investors. Vattenfall expects Asian companies to start presenting similar plans within the next 3-5 years.\n\n\"Yandex will have a data centre in Finland, and it is only a matter of time when Asian companies will follow and set up shop in the Nordics,\" Jukka Manner, a professor in networking technology at Aalto University in Finland, said by e-mail last Thursday. \"I would be surprised if we didn't see something happening by the end of the current decade.\"\n\nAs many as 60 data centres of the same size as Facebook in Luleaa may be established in Europe in the next 15 years, according to Vattenfall's Mr Almen. Most of those servers will be in the Nordic area, filling a gap in consumption left by industry since the financial crisis in 2008, he said.\n\nFacebook plans to build a total of three server buildings in Luleaa, while Google is investing 450 million euros (S$739 million) in two installations since taking over an old Stora Enso Oyj paper mill in Finland in 2009. Microsoft Corp said last September it will invest 250 million euros in a new Finnish data centre.\n\nNordic year-ahead power prices slid 55 per cent from a 2008 peak to close at 30.60 euros a megawatt-hour last Thursday on Nasdaq OMX Group Inc's commodities market in Oslo.

These updates and reporting channels are also important because employees may perceive that they do not gain the visibility they need from supervisors.\"\n\nMr Tay said that in a flexible work environment, being responsive and responsible becomes important. Companies also need to build in ways for employees to communicate and collaborate without having to physically meet their colleagues.\n\n\"HR (human resources) will need to think of ways to keep the company culture and employee bonding alive, even when employees see less of each other. Employers should approach the change in stages,\" he said. \"One way is to offer it as a trial to selected employees, based on their work requirements, before rolling it out to the whole office. Business leaders can also specify a day when an entire team must be in the office, perhaps for a team meeting, to help foster stronger team relations.\"\n\namit@sph.com.sg\n\n@AmitRoyCBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was much stronger than the 0.6 per cent increase in April.\n\nThe lift came mainly from the 1.5 per cent growth in business loans in May to $368 billion. In April, business loans were up 0.7 per cent.\n\nTo be sure, loan growth on a yearly comparison has been decelerating since December 2013. Loan growth in May this year compared to the same month a year ago stood at 13 per cent. This was weaker than the 13.2 per cent year-on-year growth posted in April.\n\nStill, the stronger loan growth in May compared to April also comes against a deposit base that has shrunk for the second consecutive month.\n\nBanks take funds from deposits and interbank lending from the wholesale market to fund their loans.\n\nThe ratio of loans to deposits is one way to show the extent banks can keep up with the pace at which they grow their loan book.\n\nDeposits that include those denominated in foreign currencies stood at $537 billion in May, down 0.8 per cent from a month ago. In April, the deposit base had shrunk further by 1.5 per cent.\n\nTaken together, the loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) in Singapore's banking system - which would include loans in foreign currencies - stood at 111 per cent in May, up from 109 per cent in April.\n\nThis is a record not seen since 1998, a Barclays report said yesterday.\n\n\"Funding costs will rise as banks compete on pricing to retain and attract deposits,\" the report said.\n\nThis is especially since Basel III liquidity ratios kick innext year or so, prompting banks to focus on deposit funding to meet the mandated amount of liquid assets needed to cover outflows during short-term market stress.\n\nA Fitch report noted that even as local lenders \"prioritise funding stability\" to fund their growing operations across various markets, Basel III rules should not pose major challenges for the three banks here. Their LDRs are still between 75 per cent and 85 per cent for now.\n\nStrength in business-loan growth came from gains in loans for manufacturing and general commerce purposes, though notably, growth in lending to both sectors can be volatile.\n\nLending for general commerce - the third-largest component in the business loan segment - grew 2.9 per cent to $83.7 billion. This reversed from a 0.8 per cent decline in April.\n\nConstruction loans - which make up the largest, or about a quarter, of all business loans - was up 1.1 per cent in May to $94.1 billion. This was weaker than the 2.4 per cent gain registered in April.\n\nTotal consumer loans were slightly stronger, rising 0.5 per cent to $229 billion in May. In April, this rose 0.3 per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Training will be conducted for the agents before they co-market the projects.\n\nThe agents will also earn the same commission, irrespective of which agency the project was secured by, unlike co-broke agents who usually receive less.\n\nOn the company level, however, the party which secured the project, termed the \"managing member\", will get a larger commission than the rest, termed \"supporting members\".\n\nThe managing member will also have to request consent from the developer to allow the supporting members to co-market the development. In the first month of the launch, half of the showflat duties must be allocated to other supporting members, subject to the developer's approval.\n\nAnne Tong, chief executive officer of HSR International, said that banded together, the four firms will be better able to address the \"shrinking pool of buyers\" in the market.\n\n\"In the past, developers were quite comfortable to do exclusives with one agency, or joint marketing with two agencies, but with the market becoming so challenging, it is getting more difficult to reach out to the correct buyers.\n\n\"This alliance will benefit developers because each agency has strengths in different market segments. Developers using PAG for their project launches will have access to a wider network of potential home buyers - a crucial factor to the success of project launches in today's market.\"\n\nTo be sure, this is not a merger; each agency will continue to exist in its own right.\n\nOrangeTee's Mr Tan likened it to the Star Alliance, the world's largest global airline alliance: \"Each entity still operates under its own brand, but the alliance helps us to tap into each other's network, combine our resources, and widen our scope of clients.\"\n\nThe two largest players, ERA and PropNex, are not worried, however, citing problems that often accompany alliances.\n\nPropNex chief Mohamed Ismail believes that the trio of ERA, PropNex and Huttons will remain the favoured marketing agencies, given their track records. \"Mid-sized agencies find it difficult to penetrate the market because of this existing preference,\" he explained.\n\nHe also foresees teething problems with regard to reporting to different key executive officers and ensuring fair distribution of work. He would know - PropNex, too, was formed from the merger of five smaller real estate firms years ago and three of the partners have since left or disposed off their stakes due to various differences.\n\n\"It is not impossible but it is not going to be easy either. (The four agencies) will have to be doubly efficient in their communications and system processes. There will always be comparisons among themselves and someone that will emerge the team leader.\"\n\nJack Chua, chief executive of ERA, said that the fact that the alliance is not a permanent fixture - that is, a merger - makes it little more than just four agencies in a joint marketing exercise, not unlike how some developers already engage multiple marketing agencies for one project to increase its odds of successful sales.\n\n\"It is just four agencies operating independently with different CEOs, only coming together when putting together a showflat to jointly market a new project,\" he pointed out. \"If PropNex, which went through a merger, also encountered problems with culture differences, how much more an alliance?\"\n\nOne developer also cited concerns with the fee structure and wondered whether four agencies proposing one marketing strategy would be like too many cooks preparing the broth.\n\nWhile he admits that he does look at size when engaging an agency, he would in fact also consider a smaller outfit which has access to a specific desired group of clientele.\"The ability to market a project successfully, not the size, is after all the most important criteria,\" he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The partnership has already begun to bear fruit, with GLP forming strategic alliances with domestic industry leaders such as Cofco, Sinotrans and Bank of China.\n\nAt the same time, China's State Council, at a recent meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang, has approved a plan to develop the logistics industry. It is estimated that US$2.5 trillion will need to be invested in logistics development over the next 15 years to meet China's demand, which would bring the mainland's per-capita logistics space up to just one-third that of the United States.\n\nMr Ang, 70, who will be retiring on July 17, says e-commerce is also an immense opportunity for GLP. \"Despite growing at an astonishing speed over the last decade, we believe it has barely scratched the surface, with the bulk of the growth still before us.\"\n\nHe notes that China is now the No 1 online retail market in value, according to Bain & Co, yet e-commerce penetration remains below 8 per cent.\n\n\"This implies significant growth as more shoppers move on to the Internet, with growth outside the coastal regions an important driver,\" said Mr Ang, who will be replaced by a former GIC adviser, Seek Ngee Huat, 64.\n\nAmazon and Deppon, China's leading logistics company, are GLP's top two customers, each occupying 4.1 per cent of its leased area.\n\nFY2014 was a record year of leasing for GLP in all markets. The group registered a net profit of US$685.15 million on a revenue of US$598.29 million. Japan accounted for 39 per cent of the total revenue and Brazil one per cent.\n\nIn a report on GLP, Phillip Securities Research said it favoured GLP for its dominant market position; landlord-favoured market dynamics for modern logistics facilities; and solid investors with strong financial capability. It has a target price of S$3.13 a share for GLP. GLP closed trading unchanged at S$2.69 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Growth has now been lowered by a total of three percentage points since the government's first estimate was published in April, which had the economy expanding at a 0.1 per cent rate.\n\nThe difference between the second and third estimates was the largest on records going back to 1976. Revisions to GDP numbers are not unusual as the government does not have complete data when it makes its initial and preliminary estimates. Economists had expected growth to be revised to show it contracting at a 1.7 per cent rate.\n\nThe latest revisions reflect a weaker pace of health care spending than previously assumed, which caused a downgrading of the consumer spending estimate. Trade was also a bigger drag on the economy than previously thought.\n\nThe economy grew at a 2.6 per cent pace in the final three months of 2013. Data on employment, manufacturing and services sectors point to a sharp acceleration in growth early in the second quarter.\n\nHowever, the pace of expansion could fall short of expectations, which range as high as a 3.6 per cent rate.\n\nIn a second report, the department said that orders for long-lasting US manufactured goods fell one per cent last month. Orders for these items, which range from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, fell for the first time in three months.\n\nThey were dragged down by weak demand for transportation, machinery, computers and electronic products; electrical equipment, appliances and components; as well as a 31.4 per cent plunge in defence capital goods orders.\n\nEconomists estimated that severe weather could have slashed as much as 1.5 percentage points from GDP growth in the first quarter. The government, however, gave no details on the impact of the weather.\n\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity, increased at a one per cent rate. It was previously reported to have advanced at a 3.1 per cent pace.\n\nExports declined at a 8.9 per cent rate, instead of a 6 per cent pace, resulting in a trade deficit that sliced off 1.53 percentage points from GDP growth. Weak export growth has been tied to frigid temperatures during the winter. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Similarly, half of China's loan issuance last year was meant for infrastructure projects.\n\nTo be sure, loans booked in Hong Kong captured some borrowings linked to China, though these would then refer to offshore borrowings.\n\nThe value of syndicated loans out of Hong Kong - the biggest contributor to the region's loan issuance figure, or 22 per cent - surged 48 per cent from a year ago to US$44.8 billion.\n\nBesides Chinese offshore borrowings, loans for large financing projects boosted the value of syndicated loans in Hong Kong.\n\nThese included the HK$37 billion (S$5.96 billion) loan for Power Assets Holdings' spin-off of Hongkong Electric.\n\nLoan value in South-east Asia fell 15 per cent to US$40.3 billion, as fewer loans were booked in the first half of this year, compared to a year ago.\n\nOf these loans, 60 per cent of the issuance was booked in Singapore, and are mainly related to borrowings for commodities.\n\nIn Singapore, syndicate loan values reached US$24 billion, just a shade lower than the US$24.4 billion registered a year ago.\n\nM&A activity in the region made up 12.5 per cent of the loan value in the first half of 2014, or at US$25.7 billion.

No European team has ever won the trophy in Latin America.\n\nBut one of South America's best players, Uruguay striker Luis Suarez, could go home early as Fifa investigates accusations that he bit an Italian defender in Tuesday's 1-0 victory that sent the Europeans packing.\n\n\"The first half of the Cup was positive overall. The protests have had little impact. The Brazilian people want to enjoy the Cup,\" said Pablo Azevedo, a sports management expert at Brasilia University.\n\nWhile fears of anti-Cup protests deterred some Europeans from travelling, Latin Americans \"came in much larger numbers than we anticipated\", he said.\n\nMr Azevedo said a survey conducted by his sports research lab found that 300 foreign fans gave a good grade to the tournament's organisation, belying fears of chaos.\n\nThis is good news for President Dilma Rousseff, who formally launched on Saturday her bid for re-election in October, leading in opinion polls despite a drop in popularity over the cost of what she has dubbed \"the Cup of Cups\".\n\nBut some fans have gone overboard.\n\nAuthorities deployed extra police around the 12 arenas this week to prevent more security breaches after scores of ticketless Argentine and Chilean fans gate-crashed the Maracana Stadium in two games.\n\nSome 85 Chileans were kicked out of Brazil over the incident at the Rio de Janeiro stadium, site of the July 13 final.\n\nBut tens of thousands turned the Maracana into home-field advantage as Chile upset Spain 2-0, eliminating the defending champions.\n\nTheir sombrero-wearing Mexican amigos have been loud, too. Maybe too loud.\n\nFifa investigated the \"puto\" anti-gay slur that they chant against opposition goalkeepers during games, but the sport's governing body did not sanction Mexico's football federation.\n\n\"Hinchas\" (fans) from Argentina - Brazil's eternal rivals to the south - have come in droves, causing security headaches.\n\nPolice used stun grenades in the south-eastern city of Belo Horizonte on Saturday to disperse a group of Argentines who clashed with Brazilian fans.\n\nHours later, police used non-lethal munitions to break up a crowd of fans who tried to break through security to approach Argentina's team bus before their 1-0 victory over Iran.\n\nAuthorities said they would prevent 2,100 Argentine hooligans from entering Brazil for the Cup. At least 32 have been turned away at the border so far.\n\nBut most Argentine fans seem to be in a party mood.\n\nSome 100,000 swarmed the southern city of Porto Alegre for Wednesday's 3-2 win over Nigeria, one parading from a car's sun-roof dressed as Pope Francis, an Argentine.\n\nAround 5,000 police and troops were deployed along with helicopters and a navy ship.\n\nThe festive legions of fans around the country have greatly outnumbered the dwindling number of protesters fuming at the US$11 billion cost of the World Cup.\n\nLast year, Brazilians held massive demonstrations during the Confederations Cup, a World Cup dress rehearsal, demanding more money for schools and hospitals.\n\nThis time, the demonstrations have attracted much smaller crowds, with sporadic clashes with police involving rocks, tear gas and rubber bullets.\n\n\"There are few people at the protests because of the repression on the first day of the Cup,\" said protest organiser Rodrigo Antonio, 36.\n\nSantiago attorney Gabriel Salas, 47, walked through a small protest in Sao Paulo on Monday with his three children, draped in Chile's flag.\n\n\"It's a shame because the World Cup is a party that should be for everybody,\" he said. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

The downgrade also prohibits Air India from mounting new flights or beefing up frequencies into and out of the US.\n\nThis week, at its Chief Executive Board (CEB) Meeting held in London on June 23, the CEOs of the Star Alliance network unanimously approved the membership of Air India.\n\nStar Alliance COO Jeffrey Goh said: \"We restarted the reintegration with Air India in December last year; and just half a year later, we are ready to confirm the official joining date.\"\n\nAccording to Rohit Nandan, Air India's chairman and managing director, annual revenue is expected to rise by up to 5 per cent after the entry into Star Alliance. The airline is also expected to make changes to its operations - such as enhanced menus for premium cabins and better service standards - to be more in line with its alliance partners.\n\n\"We expect a substantial increase in revenues in the long term,\" he told The Economic Times. The airline had been looking to increase total revenue to 1.9 billion rupees (S$3.9 million) in FY14 from 1.6 billion rupees in the year ago but will miss the target. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is said to be pushing for the ailing state carrier to turn itself around, while the aviation ministry wants to see the high taxes on aviation fuel - which has made it harder for India's carriers to eke a profit - come down.\n\nIn joining the alliance, Air India will add a total of 400 daily flights and 35 new destinations in India to the network. The biggest growth will come from its home market which is currently being served by 13 Star Alliance members flying to 10 destinations and holding a 13 per cent market share. Bringing Air India into the equation not only adds more airports but also increases the alliance's market share in India to 30 per cent.\n\nGlobally, passengers will further benefit from a wider choice on routes connecting North America, Europe, Asia and Australia via the Indian subcontinent.\n\nIn total, the Star Alliance network will grow to 27 member airlines, serving 1,316 destinations in 192 countries.\n\nAccording to The Indian Express, Air India's membership is expected to result in several benefits for the airline and its passengers, including a hike in Air India's share on the India-US route by about 20 per cent from about 13 per cent now within the first year.\n\nWith the India-US route being a key market for Air India, the membership would mean that its passengers travelling to the US would have easier access to more cities there as they will be able to travel on other Star Alliance member airlines flights going to America. However, this would not apply to the alliance's US-based carrier United Airlines.\n\n\"The biggest party-pooper is India's humiliating downgrade by FAA,\" Amber Dubey, KPMG's head of aerospace and defence, was quoted as saying in an Indian media report. \"Air India . . . would need to terminate flights in EU or Far East and transfer its US-bound passengers to Star members there. The Ministry of Civil Aviation and Directorate General of Civil Aviation should ensure India gets it category rating back at the earliest.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The government-related entity, which built Dubai's palm-shaped island and a cluster of isles in the form of a world map, is to meet its obligations from its own revenues.\n\n\"All this cash is generated from Nakheel's own income, not from the support fund of the government,\" said Mr Lootah.\n\nThe bulk of the company's debt - 6.8 billion dirhams - was due in September 2015, in addition to 200 million dirhams due in March 2016 and 900 million dirhams due two years later. Nakheel had piled up a large mountain of debt during five years of rapid growth in Dubai's property sector, before the global financial crisis hit the Gulf emirate in 2009.\n\nThe company was part of government-linked Dubai World group, which sent jitters in global markets when it signalled in autumn 2009 that it was facing difficulties paying off debts that totalled around US$24.9 billion.\n\nThe government intervened to buoy the group, thanks to US$20 billion in aid from neighbouring Abu Dhabi. Nakheel appears to be benefiting from a strong rebound in Dubai, where economic growth has been steady thanks to the trade, transport and tourism sectors after contracting 2.9 per cent in 2009.\n\nDubai's property sector has also recovered after taking a nosedive during the crisis. Prices have rocketed amid a rejuvenated demand in the past year, helped by Dubai's established reputation as a safe haven in a period of regional political turmoil. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

We hope to be able to bring good news to the investing community.\"\n\nUnder the MOU, both companies will collaborate and work with each other on a sole and exclusive basis. The fields of cooperation include equity or debt financing, coordinating institutional and government relations, and exploring early-stage and pre-specified greenfield projects.\n\nBanco Interacciones - a subsidiary of Grupo Financiero Interacciones, one of Mexico's leading financial groups - will use its experience and local network to introduce potential projects, investment opportunities and business partners to Hyflux.\n\nHyflux decided to venture into Latin America as programmes recently launched by the Mexican government were attractive, Ms Lum said. \"We feel that Mexico can provide us with very immediate water opportunities.\"\n\nShe noted that Conagua, Mexico's national water commission, has committed to spend US$4 billion on water infrastructure over five years.\n\n\"We will want to bid as many as we can,\" Ms Lum said, but noted that the company also has to look at its manpower resources.\n\nHyflux - whose current markets include China, India and Africa - has no presence in Latin America, but Ms Lum said the company would consider recruiting people and setting up an operation there when projects gain more traction.\n\nThe company is keen to bring its Singapore business model to Mexico.\n\n\"In Singapore, we participate in build, own and operate, so therefore, we will also participate in design, build, own and operate (there) as well,\" Ms Lum said, adding that ownership will be in partnership with Banco Interacciones.\n\nHyflux shares rose 1.5 cents yesterday to close at $1.18.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

When the former held a book signing (or paw-printing, to be precise) earlier this week in Arizona, more than 1,000 people showed up; the latter, meanwhile, has her own Animal Planet cable TV special.\n\nSo who could blame Yun Ki-hyoung for making the stray felines of South Korea the subject of his award-winning documentary, Dancing Cat. Screening at The Arts House this weekend as part of Singapore Film Society's Talkie series, the 76-minute film explores the lives of homeless cats living in a society where they are generally given dirty looks by the public because of their own hostility and sometimes-unhygienic appearances.\n\nBut when two non-cat-lovers, Yun and poet-blogger Lee Yong-han, start paying attention to the strays in their neighbourhoods, they become fascinated with the little creatures' lives and begin following them; documenting their observations on video and still photographs respectively. The footage is raw - Dancing Cat is an indie effort so don't expect National Geographic-style high production values - and the subjects caught on camera aren't always necessarily as cute as their names (Thundercat, Darth Snooze, Bessie, Sweetness) suggest; let alone look as picture-perfect as the ones you'll find on the front of a packet of cat food. In reality, many are mangy because of their poor living conditions - a mother-and-son pair live out of a broken umbrella in a drain - and the constant need for them to compete for both territory and food.\n\nIt's these things that set Dancing Cat apart from your typical cat documentary where the treatment tends to be over sugar-coated with one too many squeal-worthy shots of mischievous, prancing little furballs. Yun's documentary gets grittier by the minute as the audience begins to realise some of the cats introduced in the earlier scenes go missing or end up dead by the end of the film. It's a point the director drives home a couple of times, most notably when he tells the audience the average lifespan of a house cat is 15 years, while a stray's only three.\n\nBut it's not all depressing stuff, Yun also catches the lighter side of a feline's life and their YouTube-worthy silly antics - such as a ginger who climbed up a tree to escape dogs, but ends up getting pecked by mynahs and is caught on camera dismounting the trunk in embarrassment.\n\nCat-lovers will undoubtedly get the most out of Dancing Cat, but one thing's for sure, you'll never look at a stray in the same way ever again.\n\nRating:\n\nB-\n\n'Dancing Cat' screens tomorrow and Sunday at The Arts House.

A downturn in property prices, pressure to pay for last year's record land purchases, and a tighter credit market have combined to put severe strains on developers' liquidity.\n\nThe mounting pressure could lead to sales of assets such as land banks and completed projects as the government presses for consolidation in the highly fragmented sector, analysts and investors said.\n\nEven without further government curbs this year, developers' financials will feel the pinch of subdued house prices, which fell for the first time in two years in May.\n\n\"The situation is quite severe now. Mid-sized developers are facing pressure as interest rates for trust loans are high, the impact will emerge eventually. The size of developers affected is getting larger,\" Hong Kong-based property agent Midland Realty COO Samuel Wong said. \"H2 will be worse than H1 when problems surface, unless there is more easing in policy or liquidity.\"\n\nCaught between having to cut prices or raise capital, some developers are holding off for the moment, either using stop-gap measures or waiting for a bank rescue, according to industry insiders. \"The market isn't favourable. We haven't decided whether to cut prices,\" said an official at unlisted Shenzhen-based developer Guang Group, one of China's top 100 developers. \"We're in restructuring (mode) now, such as introducing financial partners and consolidating projects.\"\n\nLast month, the company said it had failed to deliver some properties to homebuyers on time because of financial pressures.\n\nThe deterioration in developers' financials has been felt on two levels.\n\nFirstly, competition both for land banks and apartment sales has squeezed margins. Margins on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (Ebitda) are now in the low teens compared with nearly 20 per cent at one point in 2011.\n\nMeanwhile, the median cash to short-term debt ratio of the companies studied by Reuters has fallen to 0.77 from 1.11 at the end of 2012. A ratio below 1.0 is a red flag, meaning cash is insufficient to cover debt coming due in a year.\n\nWinsan Shanghai Industrial Corp Ltd saw its cash to short-term debt ratio decline to 0.07 in the March quarter from 0.83 in end-2011. In that same period, the company saw its Ebitda margin turn negative from 18.8 per cent. The company did not respond to emailed questions.\n\nLondon-based fund manager Yerlan Syzdykov at Pioneer Investments, which owns bonds in China property, said the deterioration in developers' financial positions was likely to trigger a long-overdue shake-up in the industry. \"We see more consolidation in the sector. They are leveraged and have lower cash balances because of land acquisitions - they need banks to step in and provide more liquidity,\" he said.\n\nIn a recent sign of such consolidation, Sunac China Holdings Ltd last month bought a 24 per cent stake in peer Greentown China Holdings Ltd for HK$6.3 billion (S$1.02 billion).\n\nMoody's said at a conference last month that it expected to see more such moves as developers tried to scale up to win cheaper loans from banks.\n\nVolatile as the sector may be, few expect China's property market to suffer a collapse like the sub-prime mortgage crisis that hit the United States. \"People are watching carefully but we're not worried yet,\" Pioneer Investments' Mr Syzdykov said.\n\nHigh downpayments, low household debt and expectations of continuing government support are commonly cited by experts forecasting that the downturn will be short-lived, with prices expected to recover as economic growth steadies in the second half of the year.\n\nFurthermore, a repeat of events that brought Zhejiang Xingrun Real Estate Co to the brink of bankruptcy is unlikely. The developer is estimated to owe 15 domestic banks 2.4 billion yuan (S$481 million) and individual investors another 1.1 billion yuan, with only three billion yuan of assets on hand.\n\n\"Full-blown defaults in this sector are rare as developers own assets which are worth something,\" said Thomas Kwan, head of fixed income at Harvest Global Investments Ltd in Hong Kong. \"The smaller developers can sell their projects or land in times of difficulty.\" - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

The bank remains bullish on global equities - favouring, in order, Europe, the United States, and Asia ex-Japan.\n\nAlthough there is concern that US equities are overvalued, StanChart's chief investment strategist for group wealth management, Steve Brice, said given where inflation is currently, equities should be more expensive than they are today.\n\nWith the current inflation rate of 2.1 per cent in the US, the average historical price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the S&P 500 has been 19.5. The current P/E is 17.9. \"To us, that suggests that we don't believe valuations in the current inflation environment are a constraint to strong performance for US equities,\" said Mr Brice.\n\nHe expects P/E in the US to increase as long as inflation remains benign, from 0-4 per cent.\n\nOn top of an accommodative monetary policy in Europe, bank lending is already picking up, said Mr Brice. \"What was interesting from an economic perspective is that we were expecting the economy to be dragged kicking and screaming into recovery by US growth. What's actually happened is that domestic demand has been fairly robust,\" he said.\n\nDue to differentials in US and Europe monetary policy, Mr Brice also expects the euro to weaken. With about a third of corporate earnings coming from outside the eurozone, a weaker euro would boost corporate earnings.\n\nIn Asia ex-Japan, China's consensus growth expectations have been 7.3 per cent for the past six weeks, said Mr Brice. This seems to be stabilising. \"Growth expectations, we believe, are starting to bottom,\" he said, adding that both liquidity conditions and market momentum in the region are improving.\n\nWithin Asia, StanChart is neutral on Singapore equities, with non-expensive valuations and strong corporate governance. But a tightening labour market could undermine growth and inflation, said Mr Brice. Investors' search for high yields continues, and real estate investment trusts (Reits) are very attractive, he said. Office Reits are favoured as StanChart believes they are less overvalued.\n\nMr Brice expects more volatility in this area due to earlier interest rate hikes. StanChart foresees interest rates being hiked in the first half of next year, about six months ahead of current market expectations.\n\nThis could cause \"short- term digestion challenges\" for high-dividend-yielding stocks, said Mr Brice. \"We're expecting to go through it quite comfortably as monetary policy elsewhere in the world is very loose,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The vaults in the Singapore Freeport will be the delivery point and US secured-logistics firm Brink's, the vault operator.\n\nThe contract will be the first wholesale kilobar contract offered globally. Trading for a series of six daily contracts will take place in the morning, in sync with trading hours in key gold Asian markets such as Japan and India.\n\nJP Morgan, Standard Chartered Bank, Standard Merchant Bank (Asia) Limited and The Bank of Nova Scotia will be the initial market makers; it is hoped that second-tier banks, private banks and jewellery-makers will eventually also use the contract.\n\nAt the same event, the Shanghai Gold Exchange also outlined its plans to launch three physical gold contracts in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone to reach out to global investors.\n\nExchange chairman Xu Luode said: \"Before, China's gold market was in a loop of its own. But now, we feel China's gold market can open itself up to the rest of the world . . . Shanghai should have a place in influencing the gold market . . . It's our goal.\"\n\nThe growing golden ambitions of Singapore and China come at a time of structural changes in the global gold market: the global price benchmark, the London gold fix, has come under heavy regulatory scrutiny since the scandal over the setting of the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) and a probe into possible abuse of the foreign-exchange market. And gold trade flows have tilted heavily to the east since China started snapping up large amounts of the yellow metal last year.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority in the UK had last month fined Barclays \u00a326 million (S$55.1 million) for lax controls, after it surfaced that one of its traders had influenced the gold fix to save the bank money on a derivatives contract.\n\nThe World Gold Council, the marketing body for the gold industry, has called for a meeting in London on July 7 to explore a reform of the gold benchmark.\n\nMeanwhile, China has become the largest gold consumer; demand there shot up after a 28 per cent fall in the gold price last year.\n\nStandard Chartered Bank's global head of metals trading Jeremy East said yesterday in a keynote speech: \"We're seeing gold flows bypassing the London market, with producers going straight to China. In fact, gold is being drawn out of the London market, and there is tightness in liquidity from time to time.\"\n\nBut Singapore and China do not appear to be moving into direct competition with each other as yet. Singapore's aim as a gold trading hub is, first, to serve South-east Asia's needs, said IE Singapore trade services and policy group director Gina Lim, who added that it was well and good if Singapore grows to serve Asia's needs later as well.\n\nWorld Gold Council managing director of the far east Albert Cheng told The Business Times that Singapore and China could complement each other - given that Singapore is focused on the wholesale market and, China, on retail participation in the physical market.\n\nSince the October 2012 removal of the 7 per cent goods and services tax on precious metals, critical pieces for building a gold hub have fallen into place here: bullion banks have set up gold-trading desks; four banks have launched vaults here; Swiss refiner Metalor officially opens its greenfield refinery today.\n\nMr Cheng added: \"This is really an exciting time for Singapore.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The match kicked off at 2000 GMT.\n\nIf Brazil advances to the next rounds of the tournament, which begins on June 28 and ends July 13, a new ordinance will likely be drawn up, she said.\n\nIn Santos, the port that accounts for 25 per cent of Brazil's shipping trade, individual terminal operators decide what to do during the national team's games, a port spokesman said.\n\nDuring the previous two Brazil matches on June 12 and June 17, most terminals halted operations for two hours during the games and resumed work shortly thereafter, the spokesman added.\n\nAdministrative workers at both Santos and Paranagua planned to leave work at 1 pm local time on Monday, though some mooring and security workers were to continue working.

Mr Suzuki's sexist remark was remarkably ill-timed, for the country's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has been championing \"Womenomics\" as a key part of the \"Abenomics\" growth strategy. Japan's population problem is well-documented; with its birth rate at dismal levels, its working-age population is expected to shrink 40 per cent by 2050.\n\nNow, Mr Abe wants to get women out of the kitchen and into the office. He is determined to drag the rate of female workforce participation up from 68 per cent (as at 2013) to 73 per cent by 2020.\n\nJapanese women earn 30.2 per cent less than men do on average, compared with a gap of 20.1 per cent in the United States. By some estimates, about 70 per cent of Japanese women leave the workforce after having a child - more than twice the proportion seen in the US or in Germany.\n\nWhile Mr Suzuki has been the sole person to apologise for the sexist heckling of his female colleague last week, the target of his taunts - Ms Shiomura - said that many other lawmakers had been part of the jeering. If nothing else, this incident shows how the sad state of female participation in the workforce is the way it is for systemic reasons. Mr Abe must know it too, for just this week he apologised for Mr Suzuki's remarks. Even his apology was emblematic of how far Womenomics has to go; he apologised not to Ms Shiomura, but to her political party's male leader, without alluding directly to the sexist remarks.\n\nTo be sure, some firepower has gone into Mr Abe's pledge to get more women into the workforce. Several initiatives have been launched to ramp up child-care capacity. By March next year, listed firms must disclose the number of women in executive positions in their financial reports. That such prodding is necessary speaks of the degree of resistance that Mr Abe expects to face where Womenomics is concerned.\n\nJapan, having missed the developed-nation boat on equal gender rights or diversity in the workforce, no longer has the luxury of a philosophical debate about such matters, given the demographic pressures it faces. In a way, this is a good thing. With its back to the wall, it is forced to make headway on the issue, if only for pragmatic reasons.\n\nBut for proper progress to be made, long-held notions such as Mr Suzuki's have to be changed. That, unfortunately, is the philosophical problem that remains beyond the reach of Mr Abe's pragmatic measures for now.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The building is currently about 97 per cent tenanted. The $550 million transaction price is said to reflect around 3 per cent net yield based on the current rental income of the property being generated by existing leases.\n\nCBRE brokered the sale.\n\nEquity Plaza is being sold by DL Properties, which is 64.63 per cent owned by KepLand, with the remaining 35.37 per cent held by Alpha Core-Plus Real Estate Fund, managed by Alpha Investment Partners.\n\nKepLand said it expects to book a divestment gain of $59.5 million from the transaction, which is expected to be completed by the third quarter. The scheduled completion date is Aug 20.\n\nCompleted 22 years ago, Equity Plaza is a 28-storey prime office building that has untapped gross floor area (GFA) of about 14,962 sq ft, which can be developed without incurring any differential premium payable to the state, BT understands.\n\nGSH chief executive Gilbert Ee said the group intends to retrofit Equity Plaza to be \"on par with the top buildings in the area and believes that the subsequent investment to upgrade the facade and overall quality of the building will position the group to realise substantial value from the acquisition in the near future\".\n\nVibrant's CEO and executive director Eric Khua said Equity Plaza has the \"inherent quality of a good location and can be held as an investment for rental and capital appreciation\".\n\nAnalysts say the additional GFA could potentially be built atop the existing building, though an easier option would be to build it in the voluminous lobby area where the new space could be used for food and beverage outlets. BT understands that the authorities have granted outline planning permission for strata-subdivision in the building. This opens the possibility for the new owners to proceed with strata subdivision into smaller units for sale, note industry observers.\n\nA name change for Equity Plaza could also be on the cards.\n\nGSH - which stands for Global Strategic Holdings - was a struggling consumer goods distributor that took on new life as a property developer after Mr Goi boosted his stake in the company and took a more active role a couple of years ago. The company, formerly known as JEL Corp, has its headquarters at GSH Centre along Changi North Way.\n\nMr Goi, who is GSH's executive chairman, said in a statement yesterday that Equity Plaza will be the group's first acquisition in Singapore. \"Investing in a superbly-located prime Grade A commercial real estate such as Equity Plaza presents a strategic opportunity for the group.\"\n\nGSH's current portfolio includes three residential properties under development in Kuala Lumpur and Kota Kinabalu. It also owns Sutera Harbour Resort in Kota Kinabalu.\n\nEquity Plaza is opposite Prudential Tower, where Keppel Land's sponsored real estate investment trust Keppel Reit last month inked a deal to sell its 92.8 per cent stake for $512 million, or about $2,316 psf on net lettable area, to a group comprising KOP Limited, Lian Beng Group, KSH Holdings and Centurion Global.\n\nCBRE introduced the consortium buyer in that transaction too. Jeremy Lake, executive director, investment properties, at the property consulting group, said yesterday: \"The sale of Equity Plaza reflects the continued confidence which investors have in the Singapore office market.\" In January, Westgate Tower in Jurong East was sold for $579.4 million.\n\nKepLand said it expects to receive net proceeds of about $195.3 million from Equity Plaza's sale. Had the transaction been effected on Jan 1, 2013, the group's earnings per share for the year ended Dec 31, 2013, would have risen from 57.3 cents to 58.2 cents. Had the deal been effected on Dec 31, 2013, group net tangible assets per share would have increased from $4.52 to $4.56.\n\nOn the stock market yesterday, KepLand ended one cent higher at $3.41, GSH closed unchanged at 7.5 cents, and Vibrant Group edged up 0.1 cent to 10.5 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Viewers come expecting a sensory assault on an epic scale - and director Michael Bay readily delivers it in his trademark excess-is-best style. Transformers: Age of Extinction is his latest unsubtle instalment - the fourth in a megabucks enterprise that began in 2007 (US$2.7 billion and counting at the global box office) - to feature the metallic mutating robot-machines with a penchant for breaking things.\n\nA city-as-battleground scenario is standard operating procedure in Transformers 4 but before the over-long, explosion-filled finale where Hong Kong gets its close-up, there is also a two-hour prologue and attendant action sequences to endure. Bombardment by Bay is comprehensive and severe, and not even hard-core fans will emerge from the cinema unscathed.\n\nIt's worth remembering that this is a noisy, numbing, effects-driven summer blockbuster where most of the primary characters are based on toys - so there will be no distractions in the form of character development or thought-provoking dialogue. Although the Transformers universe has grown to include humans, they don't matter nearly as much as the assembled Autobots and Decepticons.\n\nThis episode features an all-new cast of human characters but viewers will barely notice that the Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) character from previous films has been consigned to the archives and replaced by Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg), a down-on-his-luck inventor, repairman and serial tinkerer who is about to lose his Texas spread to creditors.\n\n\"One day I'm going to build something that matters,\" says Cade, a single dad with obligatory hot teen daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) and the usual dad-daughter issues in tow (\"This is a non-dating household\").\n\nWhile rummaging through a disused cinema hall for spare parts, Cade stumbles on an abandoned truck which he and buddy Lucas (TJ Miller) bring back to his barn. Of course, this is no ordinary truck - it is injured Autobot leader Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) - and the federal government wants Optimus dead (or de-registered at least), sending a team of black ops heavies to recover the vehicle.\n\nIt seems the alliance between humans and Autobots is over, and the machines are now being hunted into extinction by an otherworldly killing machine called Lockdown (Mark Ryan). It's all part of a sinister plot between government official Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammer) and robot designer Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci) to build their own Transformers - made from programmable, shape-shifting matter called (what else?) Transformium - that will render Optimus and his mates redundant. Worse, these so-called upgrades have dreaded Decepticon DNA in them.\n\nCade, Tessa and Shane (Jack Reynor), Tessa's racecar-driving boyfriend, are considered surplus to the government's requirements and hunted down together with Optimus and fellow Autobots Bumblebee, Hound (John Goodman) and Drift (Ken Watanabe). Just when Optimus has lost faith in the human race, Cade delivers a timely we're-flawed-but-there's good-in-us speech to bolster the troops.\n\nThe car chases are repetitive and the battle scenes are virtually indistinguishable from one another. In 3D Imax format, Transformers: Age of Extinction is an exhausting, interminable experience. Viewers will leave the cinema shell-shocked and with explosions still ringing in their ears, wondering what Bay has in store for the next two films in the series. The answer of course, is more - much, much more - of the same.\n\nRating:\n\nC\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

When it comes to Luis Suarez, he's the perfect example of a leopard that will never change his spots.\n\nFor all the natural talent that this 27-year-old Uruguayan footballer possesses, what he also has in abundance is sheer stupidity. He should have been busy celebrating his country's progress to the knockout stage of the World Cup in Brazil. Instead, he is facing a possible 24-month ban from the sport.\n\nHis crime? Biting an opponent - yet again. For the third time, football's modern-day Dracula has sunk his incisors into the flesh of another human being. This time, poor Giorgio Chiellini of Italy was the victim.\n\nThe referees didn't spot the chomp on the defender's shoulder. Suarez, who would have surely been sent off for assaulting another player, stayed on the pitch despite Chiellini pleading with the referee and pulling down his jersey to show what appeared to be a red mark on his shoulder.\n\nJust a minute later, Uruguay had netted the decisive goal that sent the Italians crashing out of the group stage for the second straight World Cup.\n\nYou just couldn't write this kind of script. In the wake of the global furore following the game, Fifa is now ready to intervene and Suarez should brace himself for the consequences.\n\nFootball's world governing body opened a disciplinary probe on the bucktoothed Liverpool striker yesterday. If guilty, last season's Player of the Year in England could get a heavy fine and be banned from the game for as long as two years.\n\nSome say that isn't harsh enough for the wayward player. One ESPN analyst went so far as to say that Suarez should be banned for life because he is a repeat offender. Last year, he was suspended for 10 matches for biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic during a game. When he was at Dutch side Ajax Amsterdam, he was banned for seven games in 2010 for doing the same.\n\n\"Controversy\" should be included in Suarez's passport as his middle name. In 2012, he got an eight-match ban for racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra.\n\nAt the last World Cup, Suarez deliberately used his hand to block a goal-bound strike from Ghana in the quarter-finals. He was sent off but the African side missed the resulting penalty kick and Uruguay went on to win the match.\n\nIt's difficult to comprehend what goes on in Suarez's mind. He can score a spectacular goal one moment, and act like a complete lunatic the next.\n\nFifa is under immense pressure to act fast, given that Uruguay will play its second-round game against fellow South Americans Colombia this weekend. It's still unclear as to what sort of punishment could be meted out, but one reckons that a multi-match ban will be the bare minimum.\n\nWhatever the outcome, Suarez has disgraced his country, his club, his sponsors, his family, and more importantly, himself.\n\nJust a week ago, he was hailed by the world as the two-goal genius who single-handedly sent England tumbling out of the World Cup. No one will talk much about that performance any more, nor his 31-goal haul for Liverpool last season.\n\nWhat a shame.

The company operates shopping centres, department stores and pharmacies in the country.\n\n\"Competition, changing consumer market behaviours all warrant this kind of evolving change,\" Mr Poh said. \"Retail industry is actually very competitive. There's an ample increase in retail space in the last one year and it's going to increase further in the next two or three years.\"\n\nRetailers in the Southeast Asian nation are seeking new ways to lure customers as price increases on fuel, power and sugar slow private consumption.\n\nAeon Malaysia plans to spend RM1.4 billion (S$544 million) this year and next to open more stores and refurbish existing ones as it prepares for a goods and services tax that it says may hurt sales for three months after implementation in April.\n\nPrivate-sector consumption expanded 7.1 per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier, after climbing 7.4 per cent in the last three months of 2013, according to central bank data.

It is trying to fend off US rival Nike Inc in the US$17 billion global soccer products market.\n\nAfter Suarez got his Premier League ban last year for biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic during a game, Adidas said that it would be \"reminding\" the Liverpool player of the standards that the brand expects from endorsers. When he played for Amsterdam-based team Ajax, Suarez received a seven-game suspension in 2010 for biting an opponent.\n\nChiellini raced over to the referee to show his shoulder during the game yesterday after Suarez appeared to bite him.\n\nSuarez was not ejected or penalised. Chiellini said in a television interview that Suarez's teeth left a mark on his shoulder.\n\nThe latest incident will not hurt Adidas revenue, except possibly in Italy, according to Paul Swinand, an analyst at Morningstar Inc in Chicago who tracks sports apparel brands. If Adidas drops Suarez, the striker could move to Nike, Mr Swinand added in a phone interview.\n\n\"Maybe he doesn't fit with their style - but if Adidas releases him, he's going to go to the opposition,\" Mr Swinand said. \"If Nike handles the bad boy image well, it could be good for sales.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

The fund, which owns 1.3 per cent of the world's stocks, is struggling to meet a real return target of 4 per cent.\n\nCentral bank governor Oeystein Olsen, who oversees the fund, has argued it needs to expand into new assets and raise the amount of stocks it holds to 70 per cent to boost returns.\n\nThe fund said on Monday that it plans to expand the scope of its investments to target more \"frontier markets\", according to a 2014-2016 strategy report.\n\n\"We should be as broadly diversified in the global economy as possible, so that means we will continue to add more markets as soon as they satisfy our minimum requirements for market standards,\" Mr Slyngstad said.\n\nIn Africa and the Middle East there \"are quite a few countries where we're not invested\", he said. \"Particularly in Africa, the majority of our investments are in South Africa, although we have some investments in Egypt, Morocco, Kenya.\"\n\nThe ministry backed those plans and said it \"believes that Norges Bank should retain responsibility for approving investments in such markets\", Mr Bjoernestad said on Monday.\n\nThe fund is allowed to hold 60 per cent in stocks, 35 per cent in bonds and 5 per cent in real estate.\n\nSince the establishment of Norges Bank Investment Management in 1998, the fund has a real annual return of 3.6 per cent and a nominal return of 5.7 per cent.

These units are those with good frontage or pedestrian traffic.\n\n\"Capital value growth is expected to stay firm due to the limited supply of prime strata retail units,\" said Lee Lay Keng, DTZ's regional head (SEA) of research.\n\n\"While investor interest in strata retail units remains strong due to their relatively affordable quantum and the absence of cooling measures for the retail sector, the limited supply means that sellers require a premium before letting go of their units,\" she said.\n\nOut of an estimated 5.8 million sq ft of retail space supply by 2018, only 4.9 per cent will be located in the Orchard/Scotts Road areas, DTZ estimates.\n\nIn other city areas, resale capital values of prime strata retail units were flat in the second quarter. Ms Lee noted that these units are located mainly in malls selling electronics and audio systems. These malls mainly serve the needs of a limited pool of long-time customers and, hence, see muted investor interest.\n\nMeanwhile, rents of prime strata retail units remained flat in most areas in the second quarter, with the upper-storey units seeing a marginal 0.8 per cent decline in rents from the preceding quarter.\n\nThe official rental index from URA that covers retail space in the core downtown area and city fringe areas is not out yet for the second quarter.\n\n\"Tenant sales in some shopping malls declined this quarter which may affect rental negotiations going forward,\" said Anna Lee, DTZ's director of retail.\n\n\"Even though landlords may offer flexible leasing arrangements, retailers continue to be cost-conscious and seek to keep their occupancy costs low as they grapple with other variable factors such as food, labour and management costs,\" she added.\n\nThe fall in tenant sales was reflected in the recent drop in the official retail sales data, which registered a 1.9 per cent dip in April from a month ago. Sales of discretionary items such as apparel and footwear, recreational goods, watches and jewellery reported larger contractions of between 4.3 per cent and 8.5 per cent in April.\n\nDTZ noted in its report that the fall in retail sales could be exacerbated by a decline in tourist arrivals from two largest sources - China and Indonesia.\n\nBased on the basket of prime retail units tracked by DTZ, the biggest jump in average resale value last year was in suburban areas at 13.4 per cent, compared with 11.4 per cent in Orchard/Scotts Road areas.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Mr Nor Yusof acknowledged this at a press conference after the AGM when he commented about the airline's \"chronic difficulties for the past 15 years\".\n\nA loss of confidence, especially in the key China market, and the battering of its brand following the March 8 disappearance of Flight MH370 with 238 people on board had pushed the airline to \"an inflection point requiring radical change\".\n\n\"We need to rebuild and reconstruct. We have to do a hard reset,\" he said, adding that what's needed to be done was clear, but declined to elaborate.\n\nHow it is to be done, however, requires the consensus of all stakeholders as MAS is the national flag carrier, he said. It was an allusion to \"national interests\" limiting hard options such as hefty staff cuts.\n\nAs on previous occasions, group chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya spoke about fleet renewal, a leaner route network for better returns and greater staff productivity, though this did little to mollify shareholders.\n\nOn a resolution to approve the payment of directors' fees amounting to RM396,000 for FY13, Mr Nor Yusof called for a poll after a lack of show of hands in favour of the resolution. The resolution was carried but the nine directors \"on their own accord\" decided to forego their fees. All other resolutions, including the re-election of four directors, were approved.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Domestic consumption is growing,\" said Jose Eduardo Costas, senior vice-president for market intelligence at Brazil aircraft maker Embraer. \"All these are very positive drivers,\" he said.\n\nBut he added that \"infrastructure and air space authorisation in China may (still) continue to be a bottleneck\".\n\nExpansion in China's economy, the world's second largest, is slowing. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in March announced a GDP growth target of \"around 7.5 per cent\" for this year, below 2013's actual figure of 7.7 per cent.\n\n\"GDP growth has often been a very close correlation to growth in air travel,\" said Mark Clarkson, business development director for Asia-Pacific for aviation intelligence, schedules and data provider OAG.\n\n\"Although there is fairly steady growth (in airline seat capacity), undoubtedly, that growth has slowed in recent months.\" At the same time, much-publicised government austerity measures and a corruption crackdown have hit airlines as officials slashed travel, and authorities ordered state-owned companies - which include the nation's three biggest carriers - to start paying the government higher dividends.\n\nOn shorter journeys, airlines face so much competition from China's huge and growing high-speed rail network that some routes have been terminated.\n\nIn the longer term, long-standing issues over lack of infrastructure and air space constraints remain.\n\nUnlike in the US, where the military must get permission to use airspace, the opposite is true in China, industry officials say. Despite China's vast skies, civilian air corridors are said to be limited - exact details are secret - resulting in longer flight times, less efficient routes and unaccountable delays.\n\nBoeing forecasts Chinese carriers will need nearly 6,000 new planes valued at US$780 billion over the next 20 years, accounting for around 16 per cent of world demand and nearly half of Asia's.\n\nChina already takes 20 per cent of the worldwide production of Airbus.\n\nBut the country also wants to challenge the global dominance of Boeing and Airbus by ensuring part of its vast aircraft market goes to a homegrown large passenger plane and smaller regional jet, but both projects are years late.\n\n\"The development of China's homegrown big passenger plane is the dream of several generations,\" said Xu Xiaofei of the Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), which is building them both.\n\nThe 168-seat C919 is scheduled to make its first flight in 2015, a year behind schedule, with deliveries planned for 2018 - two years late. COMAC claims 400 orders, most from domestic customers.\n\nThe delays are even worse for the ARJ21 regional jet. One made a successful test flight this month, state media said, and the customers are expected to start receiving them early next year. But the original delivery deadline was way back in 2009. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The sale is the cornerstone of the retailer's bankruptcy exit plan, also approved on Monday.\n\nBrookstone started in 1965 as a catalogue business offering \"hard-to-find tools\" before opening its first store in 1973 in Peterborough, New Hampshire, according to its website. Most of its locations in the US and Puerto Rico are in malls.\n\nThe company went private nine years ago in a US$422 million deal backed by Singapore investment company Temasek Holdings Pte, along with OSIM International Ltd and JW Childs Associates LP. Singapore-based OSIM, Asia's biggest maker of massage chairs, sells its products through Brookstone stores.\n\n\"Today marks a new chapter in Brookstone's history,\" chief executive officer Jim Speltz said in an emailed statement. \"We have restructured our balance sheet, improved our capital structure and found a strategic partner who shares our vision and is committed to our growth.\"\n\nThe Chinese group outbid a unit of novelty-retailer Spencer Spirit Holdings Inc at an auction this month, according to court documents. Spencer will get about US$4.2 million in break-up fees and expense repayment. The buyers will continue operating almost all the 242 stores, closing two at most.\n\nThe Chinese group, led by Sailing, an investment fund of state-backed Shanghai International Group Co Ltd, plans to revitalise Brookstone's US operations and seek international expansion.\n\n\"Brookstone, as an icon of American innovation, is well-positioned to explore opportunities beyond the US,\" including \"penetrating markets in China and the UK\", said James Liu, chief executive officer of Sailing Capital Advisors (Hong Kong) Ltd, in the statement.\n\nSailing is dedicated to US operations and wants to \"reinvigorate the brand, making it the go-to place for unique and innovative products\", Mr Liu said.\n\nFollowing the Sailing deal, Brookstone will have about US$55.9 million in total liabilities, which is \"US$240 million less\" than the current balance sheet, said Charles Dale, a lawyer for Brookstone. The retailer's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation are projected at US$30.5 million for 2015.\n\nThe Chinese group will pay US$135.7 million in cash and US$10 million in notes and assume about US$28 million of Brookstone's liabilities, according to court papers.\n\nUnder the plan, unsecured creditors will share about US$2.75 million from the sale proceeds after striking a deal to support the proposal. Bondholders, owed about US$137.3 million, are getting less than 40 cents on the dollar, according to bondholder attorney Erez E Gilad. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nLG Electronics shares jump on report of AI chip gear development\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:27 AM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nUS tariffs put spotlight on industrial S-Reits\u2019 upcoming H1 earnings\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM", "images": []}

This comes as the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) yesterday unveiled more details behind the framework first announced by MAS deputy chairman and Minister for Trade and Industry Lim Hng Kiang on Tuesday.\n\nMAS said that it would evaluate these domestic systemically important banks on size, interconnectedness, substitutability and complexity - principles provided earlier by the Basel III committee. Banks will be assessed on these fronts every year.\n\nA foreign bank deemed to be a systemically important bank here must meet prescribed liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), which was finalised on Tuesday after a consultation in August. This ratio, part of Basel III regulations, seeks to ensure that banks hold enough high-quality liquid assets to match their total net cash outflows over a 30-day period.\n\nForeign banks must meet a Singapore-dollar LCR of 100 per cent, and an all-currency LCR of 50 per cent by 2016. In effect, these ensure that banks hold enough assets such as cash or high-grade bonds - which can be sold quickly for cash - to cover shocks that can cause short-term credit freezes.\n\nIn particular, having an LCR for all significant currencies lowers the banks' dependence on the cross-currency swaps market which, as was seen in the crisis, can quickly turn illiquid in times of stress, said Gary Chia, head of financial services regulatory compliance at KPMG Singapore.\n\nAn estimate by East & Partners showed that about 23 per cent of the gross loan balances of $575 billion are denominated in foreign currency or lent offshore.\n\nWhile less significant on a cost basis, the all-currency LCR will complicate things for banks with significant cross-currency holdings, said East & Partners analyst Paul Dowling.\n\nThe latest regulatory move is likely to affect foreign banks that are already defined as systemically important on a global level. These include JP Morgan, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank.\n\nSources at foreign banks say that they are still reviewing the proposed rules; banks such as Barclays believe that they would not be defined as systemically important here, since they have no retail base.\n\nAnalysts say banks found to be systemically important here will eventually bear higher capital requirements. This is already so for global systemically important banks. They will also have to bear higher compliance costs to build recovery and resolution plans, which could hit profitability, said Frederic Bertholon-Lampiris, director of the financial-services industry at Deloitte Singapore.\n\nBut banks will also need to weigh these costs against the benefits of operating in a regulated environment, analysts say.\n\nMeanwhile, the retail operations of HSBC and Maybank would probably need to be locally incorporated. As at last December, their Singapore deposits respectively represented 4.4 per cent and 3.4 per cent of total deposits in the banking system here, said a Jefferies report, which pointed out that the rule would create a level playing field for foreign and local retail banks in their competition for deposits. MAS wants a bank with significant retail presence - one criterion being its market share of resident non-bank deposits is at least 3 per cent - to incorporate that unit.\n\nA Maybank spokeswoman said: \"We are having on-going consultations with our head office on an overall strategic review for the Singapore operations and will also continue to engage MAS on this matter.\"\n\nHSBC said that it would abide by the rules of the jurisdictions in which it operates; ANZ, which has a sizeable retail presence, said that it was reviewing the framework.\n\nWilson Woo, a partner in financial services at EY in Singapore, said: \"Those banks with significant retail presence might have to consider separating retail operations from the 'universal bank'.\"\n\nThe Basel committee had in 2012 put out a broad framework that allowed national regulators to adopt the most suitable prescription for their respective jurisdictions. For example, MAS will use both quantitative and qualitative indicators in assessing complexity. It also indicated that banks with complex operations alone would not be scrutinised unfairly, in that \"complexity in itself is unlikely to make a bank systemically important, unless the bank is also large in size, highly interconnected or is a provider of services that is hard to substitute\". Its Hong Kong peer has proposed to look solely at qualitative measures to assess complexity.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Global banks, hit by severe regulatory costs, are returning an average ROE of 10.6 per cent.\n\nAverage ROE, in this case, is calculated as the trailing 12-month earnings, against the average equity for the period end-May 2013 to end-May this year.\n\nThis comes as the industry achieved a 13 per cent surge in total assets under management (AUMs) last year to a record high of 46.4 trillion euros (S$79 trillion), with all major regions except Japan registering asset growth.\n\nThe market share of all financial assets held by global asset managers also returned to a pre-crisis level of 25 per cent in 2013.\n\nAsset managers can further fill the gaps left by European banks and insurers, which are retreating from offering financial advisory services, McKinsey noted.\n\nThis is not quite the case in all of Asia, where banks are the dominant distribution channel for asset-management products in the retail space, with their 59 per cent market share.\n\nStill, McKinsey noted that there are pockets of opportunity to market these products directly to investors in this region. This can be seen in China, where 42 per cent of assets from retail investors are distributed without intermediaries.\n\nThere is some wariness. On an asset growth basis, there is some weakness coming out of China, and other emerging economies.\n\nNotably, there was a net outflow of one per cent from China last year. And overall, net inflows into emerging markets stood at just 2.3 per cent last year, compared to an average of 6.1 per cent for the four years from 2009 to 2012.\n\nBut the emerging markets cannot be ignored, the McKinsey report argued, noting that they are still generating the bulk of the growth in global wealth.\n\nThe personal financial assets of high net worth individuals are expected to jump by a staggering 21.2 trillion euros between 2012 and 2020.\n\nThe report is based on McKinsey's database with information on more than 300 firms worldwide that represent 60 per cent of the global industry's AUMs.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The other woman records the entire scene on a mobile phone, and asks him to \"shake your booty\". Before the video cuts out, Mr Charney looks at the camera and says: \"Stop it. You're going to get me in trouble.\"\n\nWell, it is a little late for that now.\n\nMr Charney, who founded American Apparel, once an upstart darling retailer, was ousted last week by the company's board.\n\nHe long lived under the shadow of speculation about inappropriate behaviour with female employees and, in some cases, accusations of sexual harassment and assault that he always denied. He championed American Apparel through sexually suggestive advertising that became, in large part, the company's brand.\n\nMr Charney's dismissal raises all sorts of thorny corporate governance questions for investors and boards about iconic - and notorious - leaders, especially in creative fields.\n\nCorporate America is filled with examples of chief executives and founders who stepped down after proof, or even suggestions, of impropriety. Some are fired quickly when investors and boards are alerted. But others, like Mr Charney, are allowed to linger in their roles for years.\n\n\"Of course they knew - if they didn't know, their heads were in the sand,\" said Nell Minow, a founder of the governance advisory firm GMI Ratings. \"The problem is the board is so invested in their pal, their hero, that it's very hard to get them to look him in the eye and say, 'You have to go.'\"\n\nThere has been a spate of resignations and firings over the last couple of years related to misbehaviour or inappropriate comments.\n\nLululemon Athletica's founder, Dennis Wilson, resigned as its chief after he was widely criticised by female customers for saying: \"Frankly, some women's bodies just actually don't work\" for wearing his company's yoga pants. Mr Wilson, who remains on Lululemon's board of directors, is now considering a bid for the entire company.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch's chief executive, Michael Jeffries, lost his chairman title after drawing criticism for a series of bizarre comments, as when he once said: \"Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don't belong.\"\n\nGary Friedman, the chairman and co-chief executive of Restoration Hardware, was fired after accusations were made about an inappropriate but consensual relationship with an employee. He briefly became a consultant to the company ahead of its initial public offering only to return to his old positions within a year.\n\nYou don't need the 20/20 vision of hindsight to have known that Mr Charney was a ticking time bomb. He was repeatedly sued by employees and former employees, and the board was well aware of the cases.\n\nThe not-safe-for-work video in which he dances in the buff, and other photos, litter the Internet and can be found with a quick Google search.\n\nIn one case in the California Superior Court, a potential employee, Kimbra Lo, filed a lawsuit contending that when she went for a job interview with Mr Charney, he was \"wearing only a towel\" and later attacked her and \"forced her to perform various sexual acts\". Mr Charney denies it.\n\nOften, as now appears to be the case with Mr Charney, a board becomes so convinced that the company is wrapped up in a founder's personal image that it is slow to replace the chief when necessary. It fears that the firing will upend the company's image or culture and cause other key employees to leave out of loyalty.\n\n\"There is a danger that the founder becomes too identified with the brand,\" said Charles Elson, a professor of governance at the University of Delaware.\n\nIn Mr Charney's case, his control of 27 per cent of the company may have made it even harder for the board to oust him. \"If you get him angry, it is relatively easy for him to make sure you don't come back,\" Prof Elson said. \"It is a credible threat.\"\n\nThe situation changes when the image of the brand becomes tarnished and it starts to cost shareholders money. American Apparel's board members felt they could finally rid themselves of the founder, people close to the company said, because the company's performance worsened.\n\nThe company had lost money repeatedly for the last four years, totalling about US$270 million in red ink, and same-store sales were dropping precipitously as well, some 7 per cent in the most recent quarter.\n\nObservers cheered Mr Charney's dismissal almost immediately.\n\n\"We believe investors will generally view this news positively, given perceived prior mismanagement and the potential for reduced future headline risk,\" Roth Capital Partners wrote in an analyst report to its clients.\n\nMost investors seemed to always know about Mr Charney's bad behaviour. Eric Beder, an analyst at Brean Capital, wrote in a note to investors matter-of- factly: \"We expect the sordid details to become apparent in the near term.\"\n\nApparently, the final straw for the board was news that Mr Charney had knowingly failed to stop the online publication of naked pictures of a former employee who had accused him of sexually harassing her.\n\nMr Charney is, as you might imagine, trying to fight his dismissal, suing the company in hopes of getting his job back.\n\n\"We question the legitimacy and thoroughness of any investigation that did not involve any discussion whatsoever with Mr Charney,\" his lawyer wrote, contending that the accusations \"involve activities that occurred long ago (if at all) and about which the board and the company have had knowledge for years\".\n\nWhich is exactly why he should have been gone long ago, face of the brand or not. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": []}

No financial details of the possible investment were disclosed. The two airlines announced weeks ago that they were in talks.\n\nAlitalia had sought a new partner after Air France-KLM Group bowed out of a rescue brokered by the government last year. The airline has been unprofitable for years and is in the process of cutting thousands of jobs as its domestic market comes increasingly under attack from low-cost airlines and global carriers including Emirates, which services Milan.\n\nEtihad's investment will add another stake in an airline to the growing list assembled by CEO James Hogan, who is building alliances around the globe to help funnel more traffic through his hub in Abu Dhabi.\n\nAlitalia would be among Mr Hogan's biggest investments in a foreign airline. While not having outright control in the other carriers, the stakes give Etihad sway to improve management and strategy. At Air Berlin Plc, the German carrier struggling to emerge from losses, Etihad is participating in a financial rescue after the deficit piled up last year.\n\nEtihad says its equity partnerships have helped deliver a wider network of 400 destinations. Buying a stake in Alitalia would let Mr Hogan tap a major economy in the heart of Europe with a large population that has attracted airlines including Dubai-based rival Emirates and low-cost carrier EasyJet Plc as they seek to capitalise on the local airline's woes.\n\nEtihad confirmed in December that it was in talks with Alitalia and in February said it would decide within a month whether to invest. Earlier this month, Alitalia's supervisory board gave its backing for senior management to discuss an investment contract with Etihad. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Brazil's new poster boy revels in the attention and pressure of being one of the sport's most recognisable faces today.\n\nHe sits pretty at the top of the tournament's top scorer list with four goals after just three matches, making him a red-hot favourite to claim the Golden Boot award when all is said and done.\n\nWith 35 strikes in 52 appearances for the Selecao, his goals-per-game average is bettered only by Pele and Zico, the two legends whose respective goal tallies of 77 and 66 could well be surpassed by Neymar long before he hangs up his boots for good.\n\nNeymar, who earns millions of dollars a year in salary and endorsement fees, is at a tender age where he could so easily be consumed by the trappings of a lavish lifestyle.\n\nThankfully, he doesn't feel like he needs to show off. All he wants to do is get out on to the pitch and play a game of football.\n\nLesson for opponents\n\nA sign of Neymar's maturity was evident in yesterday's match with Cameroon. In front of a rowdy crowd in the capital of Brasilia, he was pushed into some advertising hoardings by one Cameroonian player and slapped in the face by another.\n\nHe was clearly frustrated, but he did not flinch nor retaliate physically. All he did was to promptly hit back with two glorious first-half goals to help lift Brazil to a comfortable 4-1 victory.\n\nLesson for Cameroon, and for all of Brazil's future opponents in the World Cup: don't push Neymar around or make him mad.\n\nNeymar could have bagged a hat-trick against the Africans, but his afternoon was cut short through injury 18 minutes from full time after being the target of one too many heavy tackles.\n\nThere isn't much time to recover. Chile, one of the surprise packages of this unpredictable World Cup, lie in wait in the second round this Saturday.\n\nThe Chileans demonstrated their true prowess by knocking out the 2010 champion Spain in the group stage, and have the potential to give Brazil plenty of problems.\n\nThey say that one man alone can never win the World Cup for his country on his own, but Neymar will surely have a very big say in determining the destiny of the golden trophy.\n\nAn entire nation of 200 million people now prays that his knee injury isn't too serious. Brazil reached the Round of 16 with Neymar in full throttle. They will need him fully fit and firing on all cylinders in order to win that record sixth championship.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The number of individual cross-border journeys could increase to 2 billion by the end of the decade from 1.1 billion in 2013, according to Mr Sorenson. Marriott's revenue increased 8 per cent to US$12.8 billion in 2013. \"It's both the burgeoning middle class around the world and it's growing economies,\" Mr Sorenson said. \"So if you look at the United States for example, we continue to see GDP growth in the 2 to 3 per cent range broadly. Europe is stronger than it has been in a number of years, hardly robust but still at this point firmly positive.\"\n\nMarriott is boosting its presence in Africa and the Middle East on the back of the acquisition of Cape Town-based Protea Hospitality Holdings for about US$200 million in April. The Bethesda, Maryland-based company will open as many as 50 new hotels in the region over the next three years, Alex Kyriakidis, the chain's president for Middle East and Africa said in the same interview. That will bring the total to more than 200. \"Today we have 45\" new hotels in the pipeline, Mr Kyriakidis said. \"We will probably add several more over the next two or three years - some of which will be construction; some of which will be conversions.\"\n\nHilton Worldwide Holdings Inc, the biggest hotel chain, Radisson Hotels International Inc and InterContinental Hotels Group Plc are also expanding in Africa to take advantage of booming business travel and economies that are growing faster than their domestic markets. Marriott will enter seven new African countries including Ethiopia and Ghana as part of its growth strategy, and will invest about US$3 billion in new builds alongside developers.\n\nSecurity concerns in Kenya and Nigeria, triggered by a series of deadly bomb attacks by Islamist rebels, won't deter Marriott from further investment in those countries as the company is planning for the long term, Mr Sorenson said.\n\n\"Many of the long-haul travellers that come to Nigeria are doing business,\" he said. \"They will be less sensitive in some respects to security issues than a vacationer. And when you look at Nigeria from a tourism perspective, much of the tourism in Nigeria is Nigerians living abroad.\"\n\nMarriott shares have rallied 29 per cent this year, valuing the company at US$18.7 billion. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

Banks including HSBC - said to be already looking at local incorporation - and Maybank should come under the spotlight.\n\nThe decision to create a framework for systemically important banks was announced last night by deputy chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) Lim Hng Kiang, who is also the Minister for Trade and Industry.\n\nSpeaking at the 41st annual dinner of the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS), Mr Lim said creating this \"explicit framework\" will allow MAS to set targeted and appropriate policy measures for such banks.\n\nHe said MAS will build this framework by \"drawing on the crisis experiences in other countries and international discussions on systemically important banks\".\n\n\"To assess a bank's systemic importance, MAS will use factors such as its size, interconnectedness to the financial system, substitutability of the institution, and its overall complexity,\" Mr Lim said.\n\nNotably, this follows the move by the Financial Stability Board in identifying a group of global banks as global systemically important banks. The Basel committee has proposed setting higher loss absorbency requirements for such banks.\n\nThese banks include several well-known Western lenders that also have a presence in Singapore, such as HSBC, JPMorgan, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank.\n\nSome Asian lenders that are deemed systemically important on a global basis include Bank of China and Sumitomo Mitsui.\n\nMr Lim said that as one example, MAS proposes to regard a bank as having a significant retail presence if its market share of resident non-bank deposits is at least 3 per cent, and if it has 150,000 or more depositors with accounts of up to $250,000.\n\nBanks that have to locally incorporate their retail operations will need to hold two percentage points of capital above the minimum set by Basel III, which is the standard upheld for the three Singapore banks.\n\nIn 2012, Standard Chartered Bank incorporated its Singapore consumer banking business, a decision that cost the bank some US$25 million and meant a commitment to higher regulatory standards here. Citigroup did so in 2005.\n\nMaybank and HSBC have a substantial retail presence here, and hold a Qualifying Full Bank (QFB) licence, which allows for as many as 50 branches and standalone ATMs.\n\nA foreign bank that is deemed a systemically important bank in Singapore will also have to meet Singapore's prescribed liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). This ratio - which is part of Basel III regulations - seeks to ensure banks hold enough high-quality liquid assets to match their total net cash outflows over a 30-day period.\n\nThese foreign banks must meet a Singapore-dollar LCR of 100 per cent, and an all-currency LCR of 50 per cent.\n\nSingapore banks will likewise need a Singapore-dollar LCR of 100 per cent by January 2015. They also need an all-currency LCR of 60 per cent by then; this will be raised by 10 percentage points each year until it hits 100 per cent by 2019.\n\nMr Lim said the lower all-currency requirement of 50 per cent for foreign banks that are systemically important \"recognises that the head offices of many foreign banks are likely to be subject to LCR requirements as well\".\n\nThe other foreign banks can stick with Singapore's version of liquidity coverage requirement, the minimum liquid assets (MLA).\n\nThose banks will have to meet both the all-currency MLA and Singapore-dollar MLA at 16 per cent of their liabilities' base.\n\nFor all foreign banks, the new regulatory requirements will apply from January 2016, a year after the deadline for Singapore banks.\n\nOCBC's head of corporate treasury, William Goh, said the bank is compliant with MAS's liquidity framework, and constantly manages its liquidity risks.\n\nA DBS spokesman said the bank is comfortable with the liquidity requirements as they are in line with Basel III rules.\n\nIn his opening speech, Samuel Tsien, chairman of the ABS, noted the cost of \"increasingly complex rules and regulations\".\n\nHe cited an informal poll of six large retail banks in Singapore that showed the cost of putting in systems to meet the requirements of the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act came close to $30 million.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But what does a fair deal mean? Well, recently there have been several developments that give some insight into that question.\n\nPay is one issue that has been resolved, at least for many seafarers, for the next three years. Representatives of shipowners and seafarers' unions have agreed on new pay rates for about 121,000 seafarers sailing on the 6,720 vessels covered by the International Bargaining Forum (IBF) Framework Agreement.\n\nActual pay levels are agreed locally but all will increase by one per cent next year, followed by increases of 2 per cent in 2016 and 3.5 per cent in 2017. The two sides said in a statement that negotiations were \"particularly challenging\" this year, following the depression of the global shipping market since the last agreement was negotiated in 2011.\n\nBoth parties acknowledged the need to support the growth of the market, but also the need to maintain sustainable and fair employment for seafarers sailing on vessels of the Joint Negotiating Group (JNG), which represents the maritime employers, worldwide.\n\nThe IBF agreement does not directly affect the pay of seafarers sailing on open registry vessels not represented by the JNG. On these vessels, the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) tries to enforce agreements with a benchmark for an AB (able seaman) of US$1,805 per month. Set in 2011, this figure will be reviewed in October by the ITF's Benchmark Review steering group, which will then make recommendations to its Fair Practices Committee.\n\nThe two sides also agreed on \"enhanced welfare support for seafarers\".\n\nSo all is well then? Yes and no. There are many ships where much lower, national rates are paid and too many bad owners who will get away with whatever they can. Nevertheless, the general level of pay and welfare on the world's fleet is something to be proud of. Moreover, the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) will increasingly bear down on sub-standard vessels and their owners.\n\nOn the subject of the MLC, it has recently been amended to give greater protection to crew against abandonment and in cases of claims for workplace death or long-term disability.\n\nDeirdre Fitzpatrick, executive director of Seafarers' Rights International (SRI), an independent centre dedicated to advancing the rights of seafarers through research, education and training, commented that up to now, there does not appear to be any provision for compulsory financial security that can be directly accessed by seafarers in the event of their abandonment. But the amendments to the MLC now provide for such security.\n\nTreating seafarers fairly goes further, though, than paying them properly and providing decent conditions on board.\n\nIn another recent move, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) pledged to carry on promoting as widely as possible the 2006 IMO guidelines on the fair treatment of seafarers in the event of a maritime accident. The decision followed a survey of IMO member states, conducted by SRI, asking for information on how the states had passed the guidelines into their laws or otherwise given effect to the guidelines. The results were decidedly patchy.\n\nMs Fitzpatrick said: \"Fair treatment of seafarers has been at the core of the work of SRI since its start up. The recent tragic incident of the South Korean ferry Sewol and the heart- breaking loss of life have been exacerbated by an apparent rush to judgement and early condemnation of the master and the crew. What we seek is a fair and just process in accordance with the Guidelines in every case.\"\n\nShe added: \"It is not just high-profile incidents that affect seafarers. Seafarers face many risks crossing maritime boundaries on a daily basis, and knowing that they will be accorded fair and proper treatment will make the profession more attractive for new recruits.\"\n\nThis is still very much a work in progress. And as a society, we need to be more than just fair in a calculating way. We need to provide the sort of support people get from their families and friends.\n\nSo it is encouraging that the Mission to Seafarers launched a major awareness and fund-raising campaign for seafarers in Singapore at a British High Commission reception which featured the first showing of a new film about the Mission's work around the world (see https://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=6C8f4zIHJPw).\n\nThe event, supported by The China Navigation Company and Swire Pacific Offshore, highlighted the need to raise $690,000 for the expansion of operations supporting seafarers when they call at Singapore.\n\nThe Mission's secretary-general, Rev Andrew Wright, said: \"Seafaring is a way of life that brings with it very particular dangers, challenges and demands, ones which impact not only on crew but on their families as well. When I was last here, the Mission was dealing with two men who had been airlifted to hospital from far out at sea as a result of a collision. Both men had suffered amputated legs. Their lives were changed radically forever and they faced enormous difficulties. The Mission was able to offer care and support on a daily basis over many weeks.\"\n\nThe Mission's new global video was filmed in Hong Kong and Tuticorin, in south India, and described the core work of compassion and care that it provides in a safe and welcoming \"home away from home\" for seafarers in distress.\n\nThe Mission is, of course, not the only organisation helping seafarers and they all deserve the support of the wider community which relies so heavily, but unknowingly, on ships and seafarers.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Although she moved to North Carolina after graduation, she and her three siblings returned to New Jersey a couple of times a year to visit her grandmother, aunts and cousins. She called her grandmother frequently until dementia made it impossible for them to communicate.\n\nSo when Kate, who asked that her name not be used to protect her family's privacy, learned from a lawyer that her grandmother's estate had been split among her aunts with nothing left to her or her siblings, she thought there had been a mistake. Puzzled, she called the aunt who was the executor of the estate and with whom she had spent vacations as a girl.\n\n\"Her response was that my grandmother had wanted to take care of her daughters who had taken care of her for all those years,\" said Kate, who is 33 and has two children and another on the way. \"She wanted to make it clear to me that they did a cognitive test on her before she signed the will.\" Unpersuaded, she requested a copy of the will. It turns out that her grandmother, who was suffering from severe Alzheimer's, had signed a will in September 2012 that reaffirmed a 2007 will that split her assets among her five children, with her son's share going to his children. Five days later - and a week before she died - the grandmother signed another will that disinherited her son's children.\n\n\"This didn't seem right,\" Kate said. \"This is our birthright. We didn't have our father here to defend us.\" That was when she began a painful, prolonged legal battle against her family, which resulted in a financial settlement a few weeks ago. But that money came with financial, emotional and family costs.\n\nExtreme step\n\nWhat Kate's case shows is both how easy and complicated it is to execute a deathbed disinheritance. John McManus, a lawyer in New York who represented Kate and her siblings, said that like many cases contesting wills, this one was not clear-cut. \"Should the grandkids get their dad's share? Absolutely,\" he said. \"Were the grandkids without fault? No, they didn't visit Grandma enough.\"\n\nAnd it raised common competing issues in these cases: Grandma may have had diminished capacity or been swayed by her daughters, he said. \"But judges work very hard to protect individual rights to dispose of their property as they wish.\" The bar to overturn a will is high. \"The capacity needed to make a will is very low, lower than to enter into a legal contract,\" said Adam von Poblitz, head of estate planning for Citi Private Bank. \"You could have someone who had dementia, but if they had moments of lucidity they could execute a fully valid will.\" For Kate, it wasn't only about the money but about how her aunts treated her. \"They started calling us greedy from the beginning,\" she said.\n\nDisinheriting family members is an extreme step and one that is not even allowed in many countries. John Davis, faculty chairman of the families in business programme at Harvard Business School, has studied inheritance laws around the world and found that in most places, people have limited discretion over leaving money to heirs.\n\n\"Whether it's Syariah in Muslim countries or the Napoleonic Code throughout Europe and parts of Latin America, what you give to your heirs is tightly prescribed,\" Mr Davis said. \"Anglo-Saxon countries are the exception to this rule.\" In reality, Mr Davis said, unequal inheritance is rare even in the United States, though he often advocates for it to be used more, particularly when a family-owned businesses is involved.\n\n\"People say to me, 'How can I treat my son differently than my daughter?'\" Mr Davis said. \"Well, he's different. Your daughter is really responsible. Your son is a derelict who gets into fights with the family all of the time.\" Alas, few people listen to him, he said, often to the detriment of a family business.\n\nSo, when do people leave money unequally and still keep the family together?\n\nCases in which a child has special needs or a disability and will require financial help for a lifetime is one example. Another common one is when a child struggles with addiction. Money for that child can be put in trust to limit access to it.\n\nClear communication\n\nUnequal inheritance can also be justified when one child earns more than the other or if a child received a lot of financial gifts while the parents were still alive. While it may be easy to true up the other children for gifts made to one, leaving money unequally to someone based on career choices can be tougher.\n\n\"You've got the hedge fund manager and the preschool teacher whose lives are going to play out differently,\" said Carol Kroch, managing director of wealth and philanthropic planning at Wilmington Trust. \"If you talked to them you might get some interesting answers. You might find out the hedge fund manager is afraid of losing his job and really wants to be a nursery schoolteacher. Or the nursery schoolteacher says, 'I didn't get into this because I care about money.' \" Of course, that's presuming those children have the same parents. Treating children from different marriages unequally is often necessary and fair to care for the younger children, but it can be complicated by emotions.\n\nWhatever someone's reason for distributing an estate unequally, the best advice from lawyers and advisers is to tell heirs what to expect. If it's too difficult to do, people should write a letter saying why they did what they did.\n\n\"You need to spell out that you didn't forget a child,\" Ms Kroch said. \"But that doesn't preclude someone from saying, 'My stepmother made him do this.' You could end up in litigation anyway.\"\n\nIn the case of Kate's grandmother, the estate was not worth the US$10 million or more that family members thought it was but was closer to US$2 million to US$3 million, Mr McManus said. After 18 months of legal battling, Kate and her siblings ended up with about US$100,000 to be split among them. But now they don't talk to their aunts or cousins.\n\nKate said what still bothered her was not that small inheritance and all the trouble it caused but the process itself. \"It's really unfortunate that this could take place at all,\" she said. \"There was no conversation with my grandmother about this. There was no letter that she signed saying that this was what she wanted. I wish we had asked my aunts more questions.\" And that is where these inheritance disputes come down to the toughest issue in many families: clear communication. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": []}

This comes as the British government wants exports to be doubled to \u00a31 trillion (S$2.1 trillion) by 2020.\n\nRBS also expects to see growing demand for trade finance services from Asian companies heading into Europe, and needing the access to RBS's European network, said Mr Schmoelz.\n\nThe deeper push into trade finance is not without its challenges. RBS, and many other global banks, are up against toughening competition from Asian banks that are less capital-constrained. \"We take them as serious competitors,\" said Mr Schmoelz, referring to Asian banks.\n\nRBS also has to watch its cost-to-income ratio, which stands at over 70 per cent. The bank expects to cut around \u00a31 billion in operational expenses, bringing the ratio down to about 55 per cent by 2017.\n\nBut Mr Schmoelz pointed out that a global bank like RBS can provide a deeper set of services to a client that is making its first foray into Europe.\n\nFor example, RBS is focused on structured trade finance, which includes secured lending to producers before the goods are exported, or what is known as pre-export financing.\n\nIn this form of financing, the bank takes on production and delivery risk, which can be further complicated by the number of traders that the goods change hands with.\n\nStructured trade finance is seen as a more complex form of financing, and goes beyond popular trade-financing services such as discounting, through which a supplier gets a loan from the bank before getting paid by its customer.\n\n\"You need the local presence, and that's our competitive advantage,\" Mr Schmoelz said.\n\nGiven its deep focus now, RBS can \"commit the balance sheet in a much more focused way\", by being selective of clients, he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Janet Yellen, the one person able to make the lovers reconcile, did her best. Prices have surged the most since September the day after the Federal Reserve chair signalled last week that low interest rates are here to stay.\n\nTraders and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News aren't expecting the euphoria to last. Volatility in futures is near a four-year low, at a time when trading volumes and open interest in Comex contracts are waning.\n\nPrices will average US$1,250 an ounce next quarter, about 5 per cent less than now, according to the median of 15 estimates. The analysts were surveyed before and after the Fed's June 18 outlook, and the forecast was unchanged. Even after a 28 per cent plunge in 2013, the bears are emboldened by this year's records in equity markets, and gold assets in exchange-traded products (ETPs) have shrunk to the smallest since 2009.\n\n\"The surge in gold can't sustain itself,\" Donald Selkin, who helps manage about US$3 billion of assets as chief market strategist at National Securities Corp in New York, said on June 20. \"It was a temporary spike because of a confluence of events: Iraq and Yellen. People will be looking at other areas for excitement. Holdings are down, so people are leaving gold in search of something better.\"\n\nGold for immediate delivery rose 9.5 per cent to US$1,315.49 an ounce in London this year, according to Bloomberg generic pricing. Bullion advanced on demand for haven assets as fighting erupted in Ukraine and Iraq.\n\nPrice slump\n\nPrices have slumped from a record US$1,921.17 reached in September 2011. The Standard & Poor's GSCI gauge of 24 commodities gained 5.1 per cent since the end of December, while the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities rose 5.2 per cent. The Bloomberg US Treasury Bond Index added 2.7 per cent.\n\nThe median of 15 analyst and trader estimates compiled by Bloomberg by June 18 showed gold will average US$1,240 in the fourth quarter and US$1,300 in the first three months of next year. By June 20, they were predicting US$1,225 and US$1,270 for the periods, not swayed by Ms Yellen's outlook for low borrowing costs and echoing the sentiment of Swift's Grammy-nominated pop hit, We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.\n\n\"You've had a bit of safe-haven demand and a bit of inflation-hedge demand,\" Georgette Boele, a precious metals analyst at ABN Amro Group NV in Amsterdam, said on June 20. \"The view doesn't change on gold, because this is temporary. The other drivers have not changed.\"\n\nDaily London trading volumes that averaged about 18.3 million ounces for the four months through April were about 16 per cent less than a year earlier, and the least for the period since 2010, according to the London Bullion Market Association.\n\nOpen interest, or the aggregate number of Comex futures contracts yet to be closed, liquidated or delivered, was at the lowest since May 2009 in April. Average daily volumes this year are about 24 per cent lower than in 2013 and 60-day historical volatility fell on June 17 to the lowest since October 2010. While the Fed said on June 18 it sees interest rates staying low after it ends bond buying, the bank trimmed purchases for a fifth consecutive meeting, to US$35 billion. Rising home and equity prices and an improving global economy should help stoke above-trend growth in the United States, Ms Yellen told reporters that day. Bullion jumped 70 per cent from December 2008 to June 2011 as the central bank bought debt.\n\nInvestors sold 49.9 tonnes from gold-backed ETPs this year, compared with a record 869.1 tonnes that wiped more than US$73 billion off their value in 2013.\n\nPrice support\n\nGeopolitical concerns will support prices, said Jim Russell, who helps oversee US$120 billion as a senior equity-strategist for US Bank Wealth Management in Cincinnati. Bullion reached a six-month high in March as Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula. US Secretary of State John Kerry said in Baghdad on Monday that President Barack Obama is gathering the information he'd need if he decides to order airstrikes to counter the advance of Sunni militants in Iraq. \"I am confident in gold because Yellen put to rest concerns about interest rates rising,\" Adrian Day, president of Adrian Day Asset Management in Annapolis, Maryland said on Monday. \"History tells us that the geopolitical situation gives gold short-term boosts. If we see dramatic changes in Iraq, then there will be bigger changes in the price of gold.\"\n\nAmerican buying is slowing. Sales of American Eagle gold coins by the US Mint totalled 252,500 ounces this year, 60 per cent less than in the first six months of last year and the lowest for the period since 2008, data on its website show. Holdings in global ETPs fell to 1,712.9 tonnes on June 20, the lowest since October 2009, Bloomberg data show. The selling compares with average annual purchases of 291 tonnes in the nine years to 2012. Hedge funds are holding a net-long position of 66,572 futures and options contracts, US government data show. That's down 52 per cent since this year's peak in March.\n\n\"People are not focusing on gold,\" John Toohey, the San Antonio, Texas-based vice-president of equity investments at USAA Investments, which manages about US$62 billion of assets in mutual funds, said on June 19. \"Barring temporary events like Ukraine or Iraq we don't see any long-term fundamental reasons out there that could push gold higher.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": []}

Because of this, financial institutions have had to repossess more properties and put them up for auction.\n\nThe trend is expected to gain momentum as the rising supply of non-landed private homes will make it harder for mortgagors (or borrowers) to find buyers and thus dispose of their properties themselves - resulting in more properties ending up as mortgagee sales.\n\nFurthermore, the reduced inflow of expats into Singapore is shrinking the pool of potential tenants, hitting rental incomes and hurting owners' ability to service their loans.\n\nFigures from Colliers International show that this quarter, 42 mortgagee sale properties have been put up for auction - almost double the 22 in Q1 this year. In Q2 2013, the figure was just six properties.\n\nThe latest figure is the highest since Q3 2009, when 63 mortgagee sale properties landed on the auction block. The first-half tally of 64 was double the 32 for the whole of last year - and also a big jump from 24 in 2012 and 39 in 2011.\n\nIn H1 this year, the number of properties put up for auction by owners was 192, down from 226 in the same year-ago period.\n\nAs a result, while the owner sales' share of properties put up for auction has dropped from 93.4 per cent in full-year 2013 to 75 per cent in H1 2014, the mortgagee sales' share has risen from 6.6 per cent to 25 per cent. On a quarterly basis, the mortagee sale share has doubled from 16.7 per cent in Q1 this year to 33.9 per cent in Q2 - the highest level since the 35.5 per cent share in Q1 2008 during the global crisis.\n\nColliers' analysis took into account information as at June 19 from auction lists for the major houses for the month of June. While DTZ conducted its auction last Thursday, Colliers, Knight Frank and JLL will conduct theirs this week.\n\nJLL's analysis shows that for January-May this year, 13 properties (both owner and mortgagee sales) were sold for a total of nearly $26.2 million at auction. Of this, the mortgagee sales accounted for nine properties which fetched $12.8 million.\n\nFor the whole of last year, 21 properties amounting to $99.6 million were sold at auction, of which 10 properties totalling $12.6 million involved mortgagee sales.\n\nTypically, financial institutions provide some leeway to borrowers who are experiencing difficulty servicing their mortgages by giving them the first crack at finding a buyer as owner sales tend to fetch a higher price compared with a mortgagee sale which is often seen as distressed. However, the implementation of TDSR has made it difficult for potential buyers to obtain credit.\n\n\"More buyers have also chosen to stay on the sidelines with a view that prices will start to ease,\" noted JLL's head of auction and sales, Mok Sze Sze.\n\nAs a result, said Colliers' deputy managing director Grace Ng, banks have little choice but to respossess such properties - resulting in the increase in mortgagee sale properties surfacing at auctions.\n\nShe added that due to exuberance at private housing launches in the past few years, many buyers bought uncompleted properties \"off plan\" with the non-savvy ending up with units that have undesirable orientation or layout. Such owners now face difficulty finding buyers and tenants.\n\nWhile the majority of mortgagee properties ending up on the auction block are residential, there are also signs of an increase in strata industrial units, notes Ms Mok.\n\nGoing by Colliers' analysis, nearly 63 per cent of the mortgagee sale properties that have been put up for auction in the first six months are residential properties, followed by a 17.2 per cent share each for industrial and retail properties.\n\nColliers' auction tomorrow will feature a mortgagee sale property at Turquoise condo in Sentosa Cove. The 2,777-sq-ft four-plus-one bedroom unit previously surfaced at an auction on April 30. It was withdrawn without bids at the opening price of $5 million.\n\nAnother mortgagee property to be featured at the same auction is a third-floor unit at the freehold Stevens Court. The 2,863-sq-ft unit has five bedrooms. JLL's auction on Thursday will feature mortgagee sale units at VisionCrest Residence, Residences@Killiney, The Floravale in Westwood Avenue and a shop unit at 116 Yio Chu Kang Road. At Knight Frank's auction today, a mortagee sale of a two-bedder at Dover Parkview is expected to go under the hammer.\n\nSharon Lee, head of auctions at the firm, advises those having problems servicing loans to be realistic. Given the buyer's market today, one has to be aware that potential buyers would be anticipating price corrections - instead of sticking to the last transacted price in the project some time ago, she said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Abe Cabinet will break through any wall,\" he said.\n\nThe expanded strategy identified key areas of reform as economic deregulation, labour market reforms, taxation, foreign investment in Japan, agricultural and other trade reforms, stabilising Japan's shrinking population, boosting financial investment and improving corporate governance, along with actions such as strengthening the role of women.\n\nAt a briefing last night after the Cabinet endorsed the enhanced growth strategy, Mr Abe acknowledged that the benefits of Abenomics had yet to reach all corners of Japan, and pledged to remedy this.\n\nWith the main provisions of the growth strategy having been leaked lately, financial markets were blase about the news; Tokyo stock prices barely moved.\n\nObviously aware that markets had become sceptical of any early progress on the deregulation and structural reform front, Mr Abe kept stressing yesterday that his administration was bent on breaking all barriers to reform.\n\nOne of the most closely watched areas of the growth strategy is the proposed reduction of corporate taxes, which will give a boost to businesses foreign and domestic.\n\nMr Abe yesterday repeated his determination to cut the standard rate from the current 35 per cent to under 30 per cent. He still did not specify a time frame for doing this, but gave an assurance that the cut would not be tied to a second scheduled increase in the national consumption tax.\n\nNo decision has been made yet about going ahead with the plan to raise this tax from 8 per cent to 10 per cent next year, but he said that the government would \"find the resources\" to fund the corporate tax cut - and this will depend on the economy fares from hereon.\n\nMarkets worry that non-economic issues - security questions and constitutional issues, for example - could divert his attention from his ambitious agenda, but he pledged yesterday to stay the course.\n\nMr Abe defended his record of reform, saying that 30 bills related to economic reform had been passed in the 150-day ordinary session that just ended, and that the pace of reform would not lose steam.\n\nJapan's economy is about to regain its confidence, he said, citing restored economic growth and inflation along with rising wages and bonuses, which are powering consumption. He conceded, however, that social expenditures would need to go up to aid certain groups and smaller businesses.\n\nA key concern in the country is the need to stabilise the shrinking population at 100 million; experts say this will be difficult to achieve without allowing more immigration.\n\nBut Mr Abe defended his decision to focus on allowing construction and other workers to enter Japan for limited periods - likely to be extended from three years to five. Other countries have come up against problems from open-door policies, he said.\n\nOn trade, the government strategy is to quickly conclude the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement. Talks are now bogged down as Japan and the United States, by far the most dominant economies in the TPP, remain at odds over issues such as access to Japan's agricultural market.\n\nUnder the New Growth Strategy, agricultural cooperatives will be urged to reform themselves over the next five years; the number of agricultural corporations will be raised four-fold to 50,000 by 2020, and the value of agricultural exports, to five trillion yen (S$61 billion) by 2030.\n\nA Reuters report said the new growth strategy includes opening up US$30 billion in public infrastructure projects such as airports to management by private investors.\n\nTokyo also aims to double annual foreign direct investment to nearly US$345 billion by 2020. At 3.5 per cent of the gross domestic product, Japan's inbound direct investment is the lowest among OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries.\n\nThe Tokyo Stock Exchange will meanwhile compile by mid-2015 a Corporate Governance Code to improve oversight of listed companies. Under this, banks will have to appoint at least one outside director - a capitulation on previous recommendations from Mr Abe's party, which had called for multiple external directors for all listed companies.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has rebounded 140 per cent since the bankruptcy of investment bank Lehman Brothers in September of that year and the index closed last week at its umpteenth all-time high this year.\n\nWhile welcomed by many investors, it has to be said that this outperformance is most unusual. It has confounded many sceptics who warn that US stock prices have been in bubble territory for months and must surely be headed for a serious correction.\n\nOne indicator of trouble is that Wall Street indices have not fallen by 10 per cent or more since mid-2011. Another is that the S&P 500 has not risen or fallen by one per cent or more in 45 trading days, the first time since 1995 this has happened. This near-total absence of volatility is taken to suggest that the market is gearing up for a big move, with the bears betting this will be on the downside.\n\nTwo explanations are possible for Wall Street's long bull run. First, fund managers, in their search for superior yields in a low interest rate environment, are still buying heavily into developed markets (DMs) over emerging markets (EMs). The DM-over-EM play was founded on the argument that Federal Reserve tapering must mean a recovering US economy, which makes investing in US stocks a good play.\n\nSecond and more important is the \"Yellen put\", which follows from the \"Bernanke put\" which in turn succeeded the \"Greenspan put\". The term refers to US central bank resolve to keep financial markets on an even keel at all costs via constant reassurances that interest rates will remain depressed and that money will be printed if the economy backslides.\n\nThe latest instance of the \"Yellen put\" came last week after the June Federal Open Markets Committee meeting, when the Fed said that \"a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy\" is appropriate, adding that rates will remain unchanged \"for a considerable time\" after the stimulus ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below 2 per cent.\n\nIt is easy to understand the Fed's rationale since the US economic recovery is by no means convincing or complete - the housing market is faltering and improvements in the labour market have been painfully slow. True, recent economic data have been adversely affected by a harsh winter but there is worry that there could be deeper reasons for the poor numbers than just bad weather.\n\nMeanwhile, critics of such a prolonged monetary expansion have warned that apart from feeding inflation, it essentially removes risk from financial markets and spreads complacency. With Iraq tottering on the brink of collapse and oil prices threatening to explode on the upside, these warnings have grown louder in recent weeks as momentum traders gear up to push Wall Street's benchmarks to even greater heights. Investors would be well-advised to heed these warnings.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Meanwhile, popular restaurant group Crystal Jade is investing US$7 million in its first US branch in San Francisco later this year.\n\nMs Pritzker encouraged \"further efforts and platforms\" to grow Singapore's investments in the US, said a statement from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) issued shortly after the closed-door meeting.\n\nWriting in his Facebook page later, Mr Lee said that Ms Pritzker, who visited Singapore last year, was keen to get more Singaporean companies to invest in the US through SelectUSA, a government programme to attract and facilitate more investment in the US.\n\nBoth Mr Lee and Ms Pritzker also reaffirmed the mutual benefits that the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement - marking its 10th anniversary this year - has brought to both countries so far.\n\nThey also noted the progress made in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations, a free trade deal involving 12 Pacific Rim countries, including Singapore and the US.\n\nThe longstanding talks on what would be the world's largest free trade agreement, covering 40 per cent of global gross domestic product, are now deep into the final stretch.\n\nUS President Barack Obama said earlier this week that he hoped to have a document on the TPP ready before visiting Asia in November.\n\nIn a meeting with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, Mr Lee said that Singapore welcomed the US' commitment to intensify its engagement in the Asia-Pacific. They also discussed the prospects of the US economy and the TPP, among other issues.\n\nSeparately, the Prime Minister attended a meeting convened by US Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid which was also attended by Senators John McCain and Barbara Mikulski.

Maybank IB Research's target price is 44 per cent lower than MAS' last close of 22.5 sen, according to a report in Malaysia's The Star daily on Monday.\n\nBloomberg data showed that the 15 analysts covering MAS had target prices ranging from as low as 10 sen (Affin Research) to 27 sen (AmResearch). This translates into a consensus target price of 17 sen for the flag carrier, implying a 24 per cent downside to its current price.\n\nOnly two analysts have put a \"hold\" rating on MAS, with the remaining 13 calling a \"sell\". Shares of MAS are down 27 per cent for the year.\n\nMaybank IB Research said in its latest note on MAS that time was running out for the national carrier on the back of its weakening financials.\n\n\"We had initially hoped for a restructuring within the next one to two months and the statement (from Khazanah Nasional Bhd) disappointed. Our analysis alludes that MAS' financials are very weak in their current form.\n\n\"With a cash burn rate of RM5 million (S$1.9 million) per day, MAS could exhaust its entire free cash resources and gearing could soar to five times by the end of 2015.\n\n\"Hence, a revival plan by end-2014/mid-2015 may be a tad too late,\" explained the research outfit.\n\nKhazanah had said recently it would unveil a plan to restructure MAS yet again within the next six to 12 months. \"The market took this news favourably and MAS' share price has surged by 29 per cent since the announcement,\" Maybank IB Research said.\n\nAccording to the brokerage, MAS' upcoming second-quarter results are expected to be its worst ever due to seasonal weakness, flight cancellations and low industry yields.\n\n\"We advise investors to sell MAS ahead of weaker results ahead. The situation is dire, as the industry continues to be plagued by weak yields and MAS is burning its limited cash resources fast.\"\n\nAn analyst with a local bank-backed research house told the Malaysian daily that MAS could keep going for another 12-18 months, as the airline had yet to draw down on an outstanding RM1.5 billion sukuk.\n\n\"A capital injection would be a shot in the arm for MAS, but what we need more urgently is a comprehensive overhaul.\n\n\"More cash won't help MAS if it continues running the business the same way, which is unsustainable,\" the analyst said.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The exchange's proposal involves an electronic platform for over-the-counter transactions, and a partnership with Thomson Reuters to provide governance for the benchmark.\n\nThe current silver fix will cease on Aug 14 after 117 years, as the withdrawal of Deutsche Bank as part of its exit from commodities leaves just two banks, HSBC and Scotia Bank, to set prices.\n\nThe three banks work out over a telephone conference every day at noon a price at which their customers are willing to buy and sell the metal, and from that reach a conclusion on the price for silver.\n\nOther exchanges such as the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and the London Metals Exchange - which is owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd - are also in the running for the replacement silver benchmark. LME is reported to have three proposals: an alternative telephone-based arrangement similar to the current one; an extension of its open cry ring-based process as used for base metals; and an electronic auction-based system.\n\nThe LBMA said earlier this month that silver market players are in favour of an electronic, auction-based system for setting a benchmark price.\n\nThe demise of the silver fix has raised questions about the future of its gold cousin; both precious metals benchmarks have attracted scrutiny from regulators after a scandal over the setting of the London Interbank Offered Rate(Libor) and a probe into possible abuse of the foreign exchange market.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority in the UK had last month fined Barclays \u00a326 million (S$55.1 million) for lax controls, after it was found that one of its traders influenced the gold fix to save the bank money on a derivatives contract.\n\nThe World Gold Council, the marketing body for the gold industry, has called for a meeting on July 7 in London to explore a reform of the gold benchmark. Barclays, HSBC, Societe Generale and Scotiabank are the four banks left in the gold fix.\n\nEven though reforms might look inevitable for the gold price benchmark as well, \"markets adapt very quickly\", noted Ms Hunnable. \"That's been my experience in over 25 years of trading and working in these markets. Precious metals markets have adapted to tremendous change. With the right information and right infrastructure, change is very easy.\"\n\nChanges in the gold market in the past year have also provided opportunities for the exchange, which owns the Comex gold and silver futures contracts.\n\nWith the gold price falling 28 per cent last year - its first after 12 consecutive years of growth - there has been greater uncertainty over the direction of the gold price. At the same time, Asia countries have become increasingly more important as buyers of gold.\n\nThe exchange is now exploring contracts specific for the needs of Asian markets, said Ms Hunnable.\n\n\"The Asian markets are still evolving, and over time there will be more interest in hedging and more use of futures and options for trading opportunities,\" she said. \"That interest can grow over time with more education and also with the right products.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The altitude readings from the radar now appear to have been inaccurate, officials said.\n\nThe radar tracked the aircraft, a Boeing 777-200 with 239 people aboard, as it turned sharply off its scheduled north-eastward flight path over the Gulf of Thailand and flew west across Peninsular Malaysia and the Strait of Malacca. The plane then passed beyond radar range near the northern tip of the Indonesian island of Sumatra.\n\nInitial reports about the radar readings suggested that along the way, the plane soared as high as 45,000 feet, above its certified maximum altitude of 43,100 feet, and then zoomed down low over the mountains of Malaysia before climbing back to 23,000 feet or higher over the Strait of Malacca.\n\nBut a comprehensive international review has found that the Malaysian radar equipment had not been calibrated with enough precision to draw any conclusions about the aircraft's true altitude.\n\n\"The primary radar data pertaining to altitude is regarded as unreliable,\" said Angus Houston, the retired head of the Australian military who is now coordinating the search.\n\nMr Houston said it was clearly possible that at some point during the tracked part of the flight, the plane flew at 23,000 feet. But he said he doubted whether anyone could prove that the plane had soared and swooped the way the initial reports suggested.\n\nMartin Dolan, the chief commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, agreed with Mr Houston. \"There's nothing reliable about height,\" he said.\n\nRadar systems generally give accurate readings of an aircraft's location, speed and direction without difficulty. Many military radar systems can also detect altitude, but in order to yield reliable readings, the equipment must be regularly and carefully recalibrated to fit local atmospheric conditions.\n\nMr Houston and Mr Dolan declined to discuss any details about the Malaysian radar readings, nor would they speculate about why the missing plane would have been in controlled flight across the Indian Ocean. Other officials involved in the crash investigation have suggested that either of the plane's pilots might have commandeered the aircraft in order to commit suicide, or that a smoke from a fire in the fuselage might have overcome the pilots and passengers but left the engines and autopilot working normally.\n\nSome investigators are convinced that one of the pilots was involved, saying that no credible evidence has appeared for another explanation. But others say that the evidence suggesting pilot involvement is inconclusive and contradictory. Hishammuddin Hussein, Malaysia's defence minister and acting transport minister, publicly denied British and Australian news reports on Monday that the pilot had been identified as the prime suspect.\n\nIf the plane did not soar and swoop, but maintained a steadier altitude, its fuel would have lasted longer, letting it fly farther south across the Indian Ocean before its tanks ran dry. So the dismissal of the radar altitude data prompted a change in the focus of the search.\n\nData from the electronic handshakes led investigators to conclude that the aircraft came down in the ocean west of Australia along what is called the seventh arc, the area of the final handshake with the plane. \"Everyone agrees that is where the aircraft ran out of fuel,\" Mr Dolan said.\n\nThe Australian government started by searching near the north-east end of the seventh arc, partly because that location was consistent with an aircraft that was limping slowly through the sky because it was damaged, or one that had burned a great deal of fuel in altitude changes.\n\nUndersea sounds that were initially thought to be from the plane's locator beacons also pointed to that area, though investigators later decided they were false clues.\n\nNow the search will move hundreds of miles south-west along the arc, consistent with an aircraft flying steadily at a high cruising speed, officials said. Private telecommunications analysts who reviewed the handshakes also concluded that the more likely location of the plane was farther to the south-west.\n\nThe specifics are still being finalised, but the new search zone is likely to be a band roughly 640km long and about 100km wide, straddling the arc.\n\nThe width of the band is based on a crucial assumption: That when it ran out of fuel, the plane was being flown by its autopilot, which was unable to control the plane when the engines stopped. In that case, the plane would have stalled and fallen quickly into the ocean. If a skilled pilot was conscious and still at the controls, however, the plane could have glided more than 160km before it hit the water. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

They asked not to be identified because they were not authorised to speak.\n\nThe safety board was yesterday due to decide on the probable cause and other factors leading to the crash, the first in the US with passenger deaths in more than four years. While there is little doubt that the pilots made multiple mistakes, a finding that equipment on the 777-200 jet confused them could open Boeing to greater liability in lawsuits and shade public opinion.\n\n\"There's quite a flurry of activity\" in the days leading up to the NTSB's findings in a major accident, Peter Goelz, who served as managing director of the agency during the 1990s, said in an interview.\n\nSuch debate is consistent with prior investigations as the NTSB's five-member board and staff hammer out nuances of what caused tragedies, Mr Goelz said.\n\nThe NTSB has several options to address the role of the auto-throttle design. It can include it as part of the cause, list it as a \"contributing factor\", or make recommendations for safety improvements that mention the equipment's role.\n\nThe plane crashed after the Asiana pilots allowed it to get almost 40 miles (64 km) per hour slower than the target speed as they neared the runway.\n\nBoth Boeing and Asiana, which gave their recommended conclusions to the NTSB in March, laid primary responsibility for the accident on the pilots.\n\nThe Seoul-based airline and Chicago-based planemaker differ over whether other issues were at play.\n\nBoeing maintains that the accident was solely the crew's fault and would have been avoided if the pilots had aborted the landing, as required under airline procedures, Miles Kotay, a spokesman, said in a June 20 e-mail.\n\n\"The airplane and all airplane systems were functioning as expected prior to impact and did not contribute to the accident,\" Boeing said in its submission to the NTSB earlier this year.\n\nAsiana urged the safety board in its March submission to find that the auto-throttle was a cause of the pilots' mistakes. It also said that the NTSB should recommend that the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) require Boeing to add a cockpit warning when speeds get too slow.\n\nGroups with a stake in the outcome have met the safety board's politically appointed members in recent weeks in an attempt to influence the process, as is often the case before conclusions are announced on major accidents, a source familiar with the proceedings said.\n\nThe 777, like Boeing's 737 and 787, has a suite of computer-driven tools in the cockpit to help reduce pilots' workload. Such automation, which has also been adopted in similar ways by Airbus Group NV, is credited with helping reduce accidents and improve efficiency.\n\nAt the same time, pilot misunderstandings about automation have been studied for 20 years and linked to accidents, David Woods, a systems engineering professor at Ohio State University, said in an interview.\n\n\"This is an old story,\" Prof Woods said. Recent accidents, such as the Feb 25, 2009, crash of a Turkish Airlines Inc Boeing 737-800 on approach to Amsterdam that killed nine, have been linked to confusion over automation, he said. Prof Woods called it the \"creeping complexity\" of the cockpit.\n\nAn FAA study released last year found that pilots' reliance on cockpit automation systems has led to occasional confusion and new safety risks.\n\nIn the San Francisco accident, captain Lee Kang Kuk, a veteran with Asiana who was being trained on the 777 wide-body, accidentally switched off the jetliner's automatic speed control as he was trying to descend, according to NTSB documents.\n\nThe plane's tail broke loose as it hit the seawall, and the fuselage then bounced and spun down the runway. The three girls who died may have been flung from the jet because they were not wearing seatbelts, according to statements to investigators by unidentified witnesses travelling with them.\n\nMore than 200 people were taken to hospital. The plane held 291 passengers, 12 flight attendants and four pilots.\n\nIn almost all settings, the plane's auto-throttle will prevent it from getting too slow, even if it is switched off. Capt Lee, 45, did not realise that he had put the jet into a rare mode that disabled this safety measure by making a series of changes to the auto pilot and throttles.\n\nHe \"believed the auto-throttle should have come out of the idle position to prevent the airplane going below the minimum speed\" for landing, the NTSB said in a summary of an interview with him. \"That was the theory at least, as he understood it.\"\n\nAnother Asiana captain, Lee Jung Min, 49, an instructor, was seated in the co-pilot's seat.\n\nAmong the questions the NTSB also may decide are whether the pilots were adequately trained in the auto-throttle and whether Boeing's documentation was sufficient to explain it.\n\nThe FAA required Boeing to add a note to the then-new 787's documentation warning pilots that they could lose speed protection under the same circumstances, according to NTSB documents. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The year-to-date tally of around $8 billion is down from around $12-plus billion in the first-half of last year.\n\nCBRE predicts that this year will end with around $12-15 billion of transactions, while Savills' forecast is $16-18 billion. Both figures will mark significant declines from last year's $30 billion. Investment sales of real estate are often seen as a gauge of developers and property investors' confidence in the medium to long-term prospects of the property market.\n\nIndustry players attribute the lacklustre showing in the first half to the overall cautious sentiment in the Singapore property market following the introduction of the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework. As well, both foreign and local investors are being drawn to overseas markets. The cut-back in Government Land Sales (GLS) also contributed to the pullback in investment sales here.\n\n\"Deals originating in the private sector have also thinned against the backdrop of toppish capital values and yield compression for most segments, resulting in a price gap between buyers and sellers,\" said Savills Singapore deputy managing director Steven Ming.\n\nThe collective sales market has \"dried up to almost zero\", noted CBRE head of research (Singapore) Desmond Sim.\n\nHighlighting how \"the private investment market is being fettered by the twin factors of yield compression and fears of rising interest rates\", Mr Ming added: \"These concerns are expected to continue to be the main bugbear for investors for the remainder of the year.\" Moreover, total investment volume for the full year will be weighed down further by the reduced GLS Programme for the residential sector.\n\nCBRE's Mr Sim too noted: \"The introduction of TDSR has turned down the energy level in the investment market.\" Most private-sector activity is around the strata office market, he added.\n\nAmong big international property funds, the most talked-about markets in the Asia-Pacific are Japan, China and Australia. \"In most instances, big foreign investors like Singapore but find the large deal sizes and low yields a hindrance when evaluating office deals here,\" said Mr Sim.\n\nAnother major challenge, added CBRE, is that both foreign and domestic investors appear distracted by markets outside Singapore. As a result, the volume of investment sales may continue to taper off in H2 2014. \"Having said that, domestic investors can be persuaded to buy; and the office sector is likely to be the main beneficiary as the fundamentals look compelling,\" it added.\n\nIndeed, the office sector has been a bright spot this quarter for investment sales transactions originating from the private sector. So far this quarter, about $680 million of office transactions have been recorded (including Prudential Tower at $512 million, Cecil House at $110 million and the 14th floor of Samsung Hub), according to figures from Savills Singapore.\n\nMarket watchers widely expect a transaction to be announced soon for Equity Plaza, a landmark quadrant-shaped office building in Raffles Place, at around $550 million. Word on the street is that GSH Corporation is partnering DB2 Group for the acquisition. There are also suggestions that Vibrant Group, formerly known as Freight Links Express, could take a stake in the consortium.\n\nBT also understands there is a chance that a deal could be sealed by the month's end for Anson House at around $172 million. SEB is tipped to be the buyer. Assuming that both the Equity Plaza and Anson House deals are inked by June 30, the total tally of private sector-originated office investment sales will reach $1.4 billion in Q2. This would be higher than the $810 million in Q1 this year and $1.14 billion in Q2 last year, though shy of the $2.75 billion in Q4 2012.\n\nSavills estimated that as at yesterday, total investment sales of $3.53 billion have been recorded for Q2, down 10.7 per cent from the preceding quarter. So assuming that Equity Plaza and Anson House are finalised by month's end, the final figure could touch $4.3 billion. The residential sector accounted for $1.56 billion or 44.3 per cent of the $3.53 billion quarter-to-date figure - contributed mostly by GLS sites. The Q2 number is down nearly 32 per cent from $2.28 billion in Q1. Amid sluggish sales of new private homes, developers have become prudent in land bids, noted Savills.\n\nDeals in the commercial segment (office and retail) have doubled from around $820 million in Q1 to $1.72 billion so far this quarter. The latter translates to a nearly 49 per cent share of the total investment sales pie. Major retail property transactions this quarter include Frasers Centrepoint Trust's $305 million acquisition of Changi City Point and supermarket chain Sheng Siong's $65 million purchase of a three-storey HDB property in Tampines Central. Industrial property deals fell 34.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter to $239.8 million.\n\nAs at June 18, CBRE's total tally of investment sales for this quarter was $3.63 billion.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So we are looking at all the options.\"\n\nTiger has already announced plans to ground eight aircraft this year in its drive to right-size its fleet. Of the eight, five were from Tigerair Mandala's exercise earlier this year to restructure its network by pulling out of certain routes and scaling back frequencies on others.\n\nTiger has also cancelled an earlier order for nine Airbus A320 aircraft, which were to have been delivered this year and the next; it has replaced this order with one for 37 Airbus A320neos, which will start coming only from 2018.\n\nSome 70,000 passengers are affected by the cessation of Indonesia-based Tigerair Mandala. Of the number, more than 20,000 have opted for refunds or flight transfers.\n\nOn Saturday, passengers were sent an e-mail, giving them the choice of getting a refund in return for cancelling their trip, or getting a flight transfer.\n\nGiven the number of passengers affected, refunds could take three to four weeks, or even more, said Mr Lim. Affected passengers are advised to contact the airline by July 31.\n\nWhile it is a separate entity, Tiger - which owns 35.8 per cent of Tigerair Mandala - will absorb the cost of the refunds as a gesture of goodwill, since its unit Tigerair Singapore still operates to Indonesian destinations such as Jakarta, Denpasar and Surabaya.\n\nTigerair Mandala's other key shareholders Saratoga Group and Cardig International Aviation hold 55.73 per cent and 0.18 per cent respectively.\n\nTigerair Mandala's shareholders had sought to sell the airline to Citilink and AirAsia, but these budget carriers pulled out of the talks, said reports.\n\nWith a small market share, Tigerair Mandala had struggled in Indonesia, where it came up against stiff competition and the sharp weakening of the Indonesian rupiah.\n\nThe grounding of the carrier follows Tiger's recent divestment of its 40 per cent stake in Tigerair Philippines - also a struggling airline - to Cebu Pacific.\n\nCAPA - Centre for Aviation said in a report that Mandala will not be the only casualty: \"Consolidation in the low-cost carrier sector in Indonesia and the broader South-east Asian market, where there are currently 48 carriers, with several more to launch in second half of 2014, is inevitable.\"\n\nTigerair Mandala's last flight will depart Hong Kong for Denpasar in Bali on July 1 at 2.35 am.\n\nShares in the budget carrier closed at 46.5 cents yesterday, down 2.5 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Refusing to say goodbye to Brazil just yet, the Fifa World Player of the Year, with one of the last kicks of the game, sent in a teasing right-wing cross for his teammate Silvestre Varela to head home emphatically at the death.\n\nThe atmosphere at the restaurant, where I was having my dinner, immediately fell flat. Groans could be heard all around as the referee blew for full time soon after.\n\nDescent into despair\n\nTelevision replays of mass viewing parties being held across the US from Kansas to Chicago to New York City also showed many American fans in despair, a stark contrast to the scenes of raucous celebrations only minutes earlier.\n\nThey couldn't believe what had just happened - the Stars and Stripes had wasted the chance to seal automatic qualification.\n\nThe Portuguese supporters, and even Ronaldo himself, didn't even celebrate that last-gasp equaliser much. They all knew that, deserved or not, Lady Luck had given them a second chance in the tournament.\n\nFor most of the match, Ronaldo seemed to crumble under the immense weight of expectations on his shoulders. He cut a frustrated and forlorn figure as he was starved of possession time and again by the resolute and hardworking Americans.\n\nNot yet fully recovered from a knee injury, Portugal's captain, to his credit, still managed to last the full game on a hot and steamy evening in the Amazon rainforest.\n\nHis country will be glad he did soldier on. His pin-point cross from the right wing was a stroke of beauty; it was one that was destined to find the head of a diving Varela. As the ball bulged the back of the net, Portugal's World Cup dreams remain alive - but only just.\n\nUS captain Clint Dempsey said in his post-match assessment: \"It's tough, but it's just the way it goes. We're Americans. I think we like to do things the hard way.\"\n\nThe Yanks do at least have their destiny in their own hands.\n\nWith four points already in the bag, a draw against three-time champion Germany on Thursday will be enough to progress to the next stage, regardless of the outcome of the Portugal-Ghana match that will be played simultaneously.\n\nThe US certainly have enough quality in their ranks to get the job done. This young team has proven that it can score goals of the highest quality, exemplified by Jermaine Jones' brilliant curling finish from outside the box that left Portugal goalkeeper Beto no chance.\n\nGermany are next\n\nIt is at the back where US coach Jurgen Klinsmann must tighten things up. It is pointless to defend well for 891/2 minutes, only to take the foot off the pedal at the very end.\n\nThe Americans have one foot in the door. They are so close to the second round that they can almost taste it. They will have no fear taking on the mighty Germans in Recife.\n\nAs for Portugal, they have merely delayed the inevitable. Ronaldo and company are hanging on for dear life in this tournament. One moment of magic cannot disguise the fact that this team simply isn't good enough to dance on world football's grandest stage.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Amid a housing slump back at home, China's real estate giants with great financial muscle and aptitude to finish projects in record time, are set to flood the Iskandar area with huge supply of homes.\n\nIf anything, the plans are lofty; from a sweeping media blitz in Malaysia and Singapore to trumpet their project launches, to reclaiming large swathes of land to raise a man-made island on the Johor strait, and building a gobsmacking 15 towers of 35-storey apartments under a single project.\n\nBut the timing is starkly inopportune as Iskandar's property sector is in consolidation mode after ripping through record transaction volumes last year of RM30 billion (S$11.6 billion), up by a stomping 80 per cent from a year earlier.\n\nPounding further on that soft patch is a string of property curbs, particularly for foreigners, this year that turned bullish foreign buyers of properties there - the majority of whom are Singaporeans - a tad weary. The signs are acutely evident. Brisk sales for new property launches that made developers gleeful are faltering. Nowhere is that clearer than in the case of Malaysian firm UEM Sunrise's luxurious 34-storey block Almas Suites in Puteri Harbour, launched last December and priced on the conservative end.\n\nThe project has so far drawn anaemic bookings of under 10 per cent, indeed somewhat heartbreaking for the developer who only a year earlier was euphoric that its high-end project, Teega, in the same area, was almost fully snapped up within the very first month that it was launched.\n\nBut now Iskandar, which last year turned Johor into Malaysia's sweetest property spot, outdoing Klang Valley and Penang with an over 20 per cent rise in property prices, faces another test - can it keep steady amid the mammoth projects that threaten to smother its space?\n\nIt's not just the pace of change that is unnerving, but also the type of change. Land reclamation works have begun for a man-made island - this project is led by China's largest developer, Country Garden, and reportedly backed by the Johor Sultan - off Tuas, on the Malaysian side of the Johor Strait. Given the proximity, Singapore recently expressed concerns over possible transboundary impact and has sought more information on the project.\n\nIskandar, already beset by challenges, can ill afford any potential geopolitical tension, particularly since its success so far is partly grounded on the warm relations between Malaysia and Singapore. Outside Malaysia, Singapore is also quite possibly the project's biggest cheerleader, investment dollars being the benchmark.\n\nThe game-changing high-speed rail link from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore which will no doubt sweeten Iskandar's proposition is premised on this cosy rapport. Malaysia needs to send a signal that developments in the area are being done in a controlled, measured and, where necessary, diplomatic tone.\n\nFor now, these comforting signs appear somewhat elusive. If left unchecked, the overbuilding could lead to a glut, dampen asset values and leave real estate investors out in the cold. If that happens, it could very well be an \"I told you so\" moment for investors and businesses that have painfully resisted the urge to step foot into Malaysia's booming southern state until there are convincing signs of long-term viability and sound planning.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But the junior gold miner unveiled another subscription agreement with a Malaysian businessman to raise gross proceeds of $4.23 million.\n\nThe company said that the remaining four individuals withdrew from the first subscription deal \"due to the ongoing investigation by the Commercial Affairs Department into an offence under the Securities and Futures Act\", which was announced in April. In early May, two other investors withdrew from the deal for the same reason.\n\nThe CAD probe came in the wake of a penny stock saga involving the shares of a few companies. LionGold said then that the white-collar crime department sought access to corporate electronic data, information technology equipment and data storage devices belonging to a non-executive independent director, Lynne Ng Su Ling, and an employee, Peter Chen Hing Woon.\n\nThe board yesterday reiterated that so far, it is not aware if any offence has been committed.\n\nUnder the new proposed share subscription deal, Malaysian businessman Moi Hsien Hur has agreed to buy 52 million new LionGold shares at 8.135 cents each. He will be buying these shares at a discount of about 9 per cent to the volume-weighted average price of 8.94 cents for trades done yesterday.\n\nLionGold said that of the estimated net proceeds of $4.2 million from this subscription, 70 per cent will go to its gold mining operations, while the remaining 30 per cent will be used as working capital.\n\nMr Moi has more than 15 years of experience in the retailing of art and antiques and is a director at Malaysia's HH Art Gallery.\n\nLionGold described him as a \"strategic investor who believes in the growth and prospects of the company and has a long-term view of the industry\". He is independent of LionGold and its directors and substantial shareholders, the company said.\n\nLionGold's shares closed 0.1 cent lower at 8.8 cents each yesterday, before the announcement.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was Route One football at its stirring best: Daley Blind struck a stunning long diagonal ball to the edge of the Spanish penalty area, and van Persie's diving header looped the ball over Iker Casillas and into the net.\n\nHolland's new direct style reflects the principle that most goals are scored from a position within the penalty area, so the faster one moves the ball into the area - especially on the counterattack, when defenders are out of position - the more chances one will have to score.\n\nBut a system depends too on having the right players. Spain was built around Xavi, and their humbling in this World Cup was in part due to the inevitable dulling of his prodigious talent as he ages. Their passing game had visibly slowed, and lacked penetration. Holland in turn would not be so effective without the extraordinary skills of van Persie and Robben.\n\nSpirit is the third ingredient. While a good coach and strong leaders among the players makes a big difference, there is an element that stems from national culture and history.\n\nBloodied but unbowed\n\nEnglish players are renowned for fighting to the last whistle, bloodied but unbowed, and then bottling it in the resulting penalty shoot out.\n\nBrazilians have a unique relationship to the ball in that they perceive in it a feminine character. The ball to a Brazilian is a woman who must be cajoled - never commanded - into doing a player's bidding. Thus, as only Brazilians understand its gender, only Brazilians have achieved true mastery of bend and swerve in the flight of a football, where long after departing the player's boot, the ball can suddenly change direction and elude the opposition's goalkeeper.\n\nThere are lessons for business from football, especially in the field of professional services such as the practice of law, where it is all about people working together to achieve an outcome, often in direct confrontation against an opponent. A great law firm must combine talent with a strong culture and an effective system that supports the delivery of results for clients. Often, there is a need for lawyers to work in teams, and while having a \"star striker\" is important, he or she needs someone who can make the \"assists\".\n\nOver time, firms develop distinctive cultures, and these too can be critical for shaping how individual lawyers within firms practise, and in turn, what clients can expect. As managing partner, I find and develop hard-working, talented people, playing them within an effective team system. We tweak and update our culture, to meet the evolving demands of the market.\n\nSo - just to be clear - when I watch the World Cup, it's really for work.\n\nThe writer, managing partner of Rodyk & Davidson, supports Germany in the BT-Coca-Cola World Cup Charity Drive\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This will consist of a placement tranche of 136.6 million stapled securities and a public tranche of 45.5 million stapled securities.\n\nIts sponsor Frasers Centrepoint Limited (FCL) is injecting six serviced residences into FHT; FCL's major shareholder TCC Group is injecting the other six hotels that include InterContinental Singapore and The Westin Kuala Lumpur.\n\nWith an initial $1.66 billion portfolio of 1,928 hotel rooms and 842 serviced residence units, FHT will be the largest global hospitality portfolio listed here in terms of the number of rooms, the company said.\n\nAnother 232.9 million stapled securities will be issued to cornerstone investors, including DBS, Malaysia's Fortress Capital Asset Management, Metro Holdings and Gordon Tang, the non-executive director of SingHaiyi Group.\n\nTong Jinquan, the founder of Shanghai-based developer Summit Group and China's 35th richest man on the Forbes list, will take a 4.8 per cent stake, making him the largest cornerstone investor in FHT.\n\nHis other holdings in Singapore Reits, also held through an investment holding company, include Suntec Reit, Cambridge Industrial Trust, Lippo Malls Indonesia Retail Trust and OUE Commercial Reit.\n\nPost-listing, FCL and the TCC Group will hold respective 22 per cent and 43 per cent stakes in FHT before the over-allotment option is exercised. FHT is expected to have a market value of $1.77 billion, based on its offer price.\n\nIts listing is said to mark the first step in merging the property assets of Thai tycoon Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi's business empire comprising FCL and the TCC Group, after winning control of beverage and property conglomerate Fraser and Neave in a $13.8 billion takeover last year. F&N spun off property arm FCL in a listing in January.\n\nThe prospectus says: \"FHT is able to leverage and benefit from the Sponsor's and Strategic Partner's networks for a future pipeline of assets that FHT could potentially acquire, where these assets meet FHT's investment criteria.\"\n\nBut FHT has \"full flexibility in acquiring suitable assets regardless of hotel operator\", though it has right of first refusal (ROFR) for income-producing assets from FCL and TCC Group.\n\nBased on unaudited proforma performance, FHT's net property income from its initial portfolio was $80.3 million in fiscal 2013, up from $76.9 million in 2012; distribution income was $66.4 million in FY2013, up from $62.3 million from FY2012.\n\nFHT has a policy to distribute 100 per cent of its distributable income in the forecast period of 2014 and 2015 and at least 90 per cent of its distributable income thereafter.\n\nDBS is the issue manager for this IPO and is underwriting the IPO with Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered and UOB.\n\nThe offer will open on July 1 and close on July 10.

The year-to-date announced total stood at US$54.4 billion, almost three times the US$19.1 billion aggregate in the first half of 2013.\n\nThe announced volumes were the strongest ever for a semi-annual period since records began in 1983, Thomson Reuters said.\n\nOn a completed basis, M&A deal volume since April rose 19.5 per cent year on year to US$13.6 billion, according to data from Dealogic. Year-to-date completed deal volume of US$30.6 billion is down 16.4 per cent, however, because year-ago numbers had an exceptional boost from the takeover of Fraser and Neave.\n\nCross-border deals have contributed to the current surge in activity, DBS Bank head of strategic advisory Choe Tse Wei said. Large companies continue to enjoy easy access to capital, and that is providing a strong foundation for expansion.\n\n\"Asian companies are willing to expand beyond their national borders as they gain confidence in integrating cross-border acquisitions,\" he said.\n\nAnnounced inbound deals shot up to US$9.3 billion in the first half, compared to just US$1.7 billion a year earlier, on a rash of consumer staples acquisitions, according to Thomson Reuters. Outbound deal volume rose to US$26.5 billion from a year-ago US$7.7 billion, led by real estate and financial players.\n\nKPMG Corporate Finance head of M&A Benjamin Ong said the integration of South-east Asia has attracted global players.\n\n\"The upcoming Asean Economic Community or AEC is expected to further boost growth in the region,\" Mr Ong said. \"Overseas companies seeking an Asean presence are likely to be interested in acquiring Singapore companies with strong brands, intellectual property and regional exposure as a base.\"\n\nA growing diversity of deal-makers has also added to volumes. Trade buyers, strategic acquisitions of minority stakes and partial takeovers intended to spark a positive re-rating of a company are transactions that have been making an impact, Mr Choe said.\n\n\"Privatisations of listed companies by their incumbent controlling shareholders are not the only game in town,\" he said.\n\nDiana Koh, partner for transaction services at KPMG in Singapore, said shareholders are keen to see more deals.\n\n\"The growing appetite for deals and an increase in pressure to transact are two sides of the same coin,\" she said. \"Investors have been patient over the last three to four years but as deal capacity continues rising while global markets maintain some stability, the pressure on cash-rich corporates to start deal-making again will intensify. Investors' continuing interest in South-east Asia, with Singapore as a regional hub, will drive volumes.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

As a result, private road transport costs climbed by 8.1 per cent year-on-year last month, stronger than the 5.7 per cent rise in April. Petrol pump prices also edged up at a faster pace in May.\n\nThe median forecast of 21 economists polled by Bloomberg (before the Department of Statistics released the data yesterday) was for a marginally lower 2.6 per cent year-on-year rise in the consumer price index (CPI).\n\nApart from private road transport costs, price increases for all other major categories moderated slightly during the month.\n\nAccommodation costs rose by 0.9 per cent in May versus 1.1 per cent in the preceding month, due to a slower pace of increase in imputed rentals on owner-occupied accommodation. The government and private-sector economists expect the latter to stabilise this year, given the large supply of newly completed housing units.\n\nWith May's broad-based easing in prices, MAS core inflation - which excludes accommodation and private road transport costs - moderated to 2.2 per cent from April's 2.3 per cent.\n\nNevertheless, ANZ, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, CIMB and UOB economists were keen to stress that a gradual uptrend in core inflation remains the baseline forecast.\n\nUOB economist Francis Tan told BT: \"May's figure doesn't change the fact that there is still pressure for core inflation to go higher. It may have gone down a bit this time around, but there's still an upward trend.\"\n\nLast month's moderation in core inflation was due to lower contributions from food items and services. Food inflation came in slightly lower at 3 per cent in May compared with 3.1 per cent in the previous month, reflecting a smaller increase in non-cooked food prices.\n\nServices inflation edged down to 2.5 per cent from 2.7 per cent in April, as holiday travel costs and health insurance premiums rose more moderately.\n\nBut Barclays and CIMB economists believe the reprieve will be short-lived. Said CIMB economist Song Seng Wun: \"Services inflation is going to go up as a result of domestic cost pressures - and firms are likely to pass these on to consumers.\"\n\nMAS and MTI reiterated that core inflation is projected to \"stay elevated\" at 2-3 per cent in 2014, while headline inflation is expected to come in at 1.5-2.5 per cent.\n\nWhile economists do not anticipate a change in MAS's monetary policy stance, Kit Wei Zheng from Citi said in a research note: \"But should growth expectations persistently disappoint, we would watch for potential knock-on effects on the jobs market and core inflation as a signpost for any shift in policy bias.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The world's apex football organisation has been mired in allegations of corruption for years. The latest scandal to surface is about the circumstances behind the secret vote used to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. Everything about that decision seemed odd.\n\nDocuments published by Britain's The Sunday Times newspaper recently purported to show bribes paid to secure the 2022 World Cup for Qatar - a small desert nation with little history of the game which proposed to run the tournament during summer when temperatures often hit 50 degrees C.\n\nAmid swirling accusations of impropriety after that controversial decision, Fifa quickly launched an investigation led by an American lawyer, Michael Garcia. Last week, he was quoted as saying that he had prior access to the \"vast majority\" of the data disclosed by the media. he had also conducted interviews with members of all the bidding teams for the 2018 (which was awarded to Russia) and 2022 World Cups, as well as with members of Fifa's executive committee at the time of the 2010 vote.\n\nHe is expected to submit his report to the adjudication chamber of Fifa's ethics committee in about five weeks. This chamber has the sole authority to impose sanctions, take disciplinary action or decide whether there is a case to answer. Clearly then Fifa is, for all intents and purposes, almost a law unto itself.\n\nFootball is big business. For just the current tournament, Fifa is expected to rake in some US$4 billion from ticket sales, corporate sponsorships, and other revenue streams. In turn, Fifa will give away US$576 million - including US$35 million to the champions, US$25 million to the runners up, and smaller sums to every other team down to US$8 million for those knocked out in the group stage.\n\nSome corporate sponsors have voiced their concerns about the way Fifa runs the business. Given that they fork over some US$1.5 billion over a four-year World Cup cycle, they have every right to demand transparency and accountability. But they are unlikely to rock the boat. The real power is with the national associations of the countries that dominate world football. Indeed, they could conceivably warn Fifa that they would refuse to play in Qatar unless they are satisfied with findings of the Garcia investigation and the subsequent sanctions. If national associations of England, Germany, France, Spain, Italy in Europe and Brazil and Argentina in South America collectively push Fifa, the organisation will come to heel.\n\nWhether this will happen is not clear. But what is clear is that Fifa needs to put its house in order.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Analysts said that the stock rose because the CEO ended speculation that US$1.3 billion from Siemens could fund a new push for Waertsilae.\n\n\"A potential acquisition of Waertsilae has been a major overhang on the Rolls-Royce share price since January,\" JP Morgan Cazenove analyst David Perry said in a note. \"This is now removed, at least for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nLiberum analyst Ben Bourne said that Rolls-Royce would have been able to renew a takeover bid for Helsinki-based Waertsilae post July, adding that the buyback represents a \"massive vote of confidence in their cash flow\", especially coming so soon after the transaction with Daimler.\n\nThe European industrials sector has seen the value of deals triple to US$111.5 billion this year, including proposed transactions including competing offers for Alstom SA from GE and Siemens, as the economic rebound and cheap financing support deal-making, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nRolls-Royce said in February that sales growth will pause in 2014 for the first time in a decade as lower demand for defence equipment offsets healthy civil aviation sales. The muted outlook was a rare miss for the company, which has rewarded investors with a stock-price gains in 10 of the past 11 years, coupled with steady earnings and dividend payouts.\n\nThe UK engine-maker has focused on long-range airliners, with powerplants on the Airbus Group NV 380 superjumbo, Boeing Co's latest 787 Dreamliner and exclusivity on the new A350 due to begin commercial flying this year. It has 2,500 Trent family jet turbines in service and orders for a similar same number.\n\nStill, Rolls-Royce faces a challenge on future aircraft, with GE the exclusive provider for the Boeing 777X twin-engine wide-body due around 2020, and Pratt seeking long-haul applications for geared turbofan technology developed for narrow-body planes.\n\nRolls-Royce said in February that it is also working on a so-called UltraFan that would be available from 2025 and offer a 10 per cent efficiency versus the TrentXWB from the A350. The company is also looking for ways to re-enter the single-aisle jet market, a sector that Mr Rishton said at an investor event last Thursday represents a \"clear opportunity\" for the company. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The bizarre circumstances surrounding the plane's disappearance have led investigators to suspect that someone deliberately turned off its transponders and communications systems shortly before it vanished in the early hours of March 8 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, carrying 239 passengers and crew.\n\nThat theory, which has alarmed airlines, governments, pilots, plane-makers and parts suppliers, has triggered a flurry of discussions about how best to ensure continuous tracking of commercial jets and to protect vital safety systems from unlawful tampering by a rogue pilot or hijacker.\n\nVarious groups, including the International Civil Aviation Organization, an arm of the United Nations, and the International Air Transport Association (Iata), a global airline lobby, have convened separate task forces to study dozens of potential solutions using existing technology.\n\nBut those discussions have largely sidestepped the question of whether, as a rule, transponders should be made impossible to deactivate from the cockpit, as hijackers did in the terrorist attacks on Sept 11, 2001. Airlines and pilots have expressed strong reservations about any measures that might prevent aircrews from disabling such systems for legitimate safety reasons, such as an electrical fire or electromagnetic interference.\n\n\"Speaking as a former pilot myself, if I had a particular piece of kit in the cockpit and I wanted to stop it smoking or being on fire, I could disable that,\" Kevin Hiatt, senior vice-president for safety and flight operations at the Iata, told reporters at an airline industry conference in Doha, Qatar, this month.\n\nEuropean officials say their proposals will probably focus on new performance standards for transponders and communications equipment rather than dictate technological changes to airlines and manufacturers.\n\nTheir hope is that such an approach will speed up eventual negotiations with other national regulators, including the Federal Aviation Administration in the US, as well as the UN aviation agency that is ultimately charged with setting global standards for the industry.\n\nThe European Commission, the executive body of the EU, is already preparing new legislation aimed at improving the chances of finding the flight recorders of aircraft after they have crashed - a move that follows recommendations made more than three years ago by the French officials who investigated the 2009 crash of an Air France jet off the coast of Brazil. Those new rules, which would take effect in 2018, are expected to be approved by the European Parliament by early 2015.\n\nOfficials from the Iata and the UN aviation agency declined to comment on the European proposals.\n\nEuropean officials acknowledge the safety trade-offs associated with adding any new requirements. Still, they maintain that there are already a number of readily available, autonomous positioning systems that require very little power and pose a limited risk of fire. Such systems are also relatively inexpensive, they say, and could be installed by airlines with minimal investment and disruption.\n\nThe officials said Brussels was open to considering alternative solutions - if they could guarantee that an aircraft could be located within a radius of 6 nautical miles in the event of an accident. Such systems, one official said, would need to be fully resistant to in-flight tampering and be battery-powered to withstand the loss of onboard electrical power.\n\nIncreasing the location-reporting requirement to within 6 nautical miles would require aircraft to transmit such data roughly once a minute at typical cruising speeds, analysts said. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Closed on Mon\n\nTHERE are several ways to get to Luke's Oyster Bar, but they're not particularly stylish. If you're used to valet-parking your Lamborghini at the doorstep of any haute hangout du jour, it may feel alien to leave it in a ground floor carpark and pick your way past racks of Great Singapore Sale merchandise to find the hidden polished doors of the popular American eatery's sophomore outpost.\n\nThis is if you know your way in the first place. If not, you'll have to ask one of the Robinsons sales staff (\"There's no Luke here\") or a passing security guard who will lead you, Cub Scout-style - using the FitFlop rack and women's jackets as markers instead of tree stumps - to your destination. Oh, if you're in need of an office cover-up, there are on-trend floral print designs at 50 per cent off.\n\nJust park any hopes for a bargain at the restaurant's doors, because once you enter this coyly lit inner sanctum - dressed in posh slate-grey, chrome and wood, with handsome booths and long counter - you're looking at designer price points. Lobster pot pie at $105; John Dory for $95; half dozen oysters for $45; salads from $27 and sides; 12 bucks for French fries and $20 if you want hash browns with cheese.\n\nBut - bear in mind that the prices look high in absolute number, but this is an American eatery, with commensurate portions, so you can actually split quite a number of the courses between two people and have a decent portion each.\n\nJudicious ordering will set you back a minimum of $70 to $80 a person, although if you're disciplined enough to just order a lunch special and dessert, you might be able to squeeze into a size $50 menu before taxes.\n\nComplimentary circles of crumbly sweet cornbread and whipped butter lay the groundwork for starters such as lightly smoked salmon ($18), that flakes into delicate chunks of glistening, barely cooked flesh with just a hint of saltiness. Linseed crackers are hard but helpful edible spoons for you to scoop up every tartare-like mouthful. Lobster sliders ($24) are pricey for what they are - three bite-sized brioche buns filled with even smaller scoops of mayo studded with bits of lobster. While overly creamy, the light airy brioche is the perfect balance of puff and chewiness.\n\nIf they take out the clams from Luke's clam chowder ($17), you'd be left with a pot of thick cream the likes of which we haven't seen since they took lard out of char kway teow. This old-school favourite cocks a snook at dieters and challenges you to eat like an uninhibited American, with its motherlode of little neck clams caught in a briny tidal wave of cream and diced potatoes. Spread the guilt and split the portion into two - the helpful staff (when you can catch them) are used to the drill.\n\nOysters are run-of-the-mill. Fresh, but without the smooth, plump creaminess you'd expect. Out of the Katama Bay, Rip Tide and Wellfleet specimens we sample, Wellfleet comes closest to passing muster.\n\nAlso underwhelming are the overpriced crab cakes ($47) - crumbed patties filled with generous but lacklustre crabmeat sitting in a grain mustard sauce. We prefer the juicy giant prawns that live up to the name of Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail ($36) - five whoppers are poised over a glass of homemade cocktail sauce which merely gets in the way of enjoying the succulence of the prawns.\n\nThe lunch specials are well worth the money, whether it's the good quality tenderloin with fries ($37) done medium rare and comparable to more expensive cuts elsewhere; a textbook perfect burger ($27) of chopped rib-eye patty sandwiched in a larger version of the brioche bun used for the lobster sliders; an interesting veggie burger made with oats, wild rice and prunes that's sweet, chewy and almost meaty.\n\nOr you could plump for the kurobuta pork chop ($60) - a hunk of meat on the bone that's nicely pink in the middle and juicy despite the overall tough leanness, with braised apple chunks on top. Counter the meat overdose with healthy chopped kale ($15 as a side dish) tossed in a too-sweet peanut dressing or chewy wild rice and blueberry ($15) salad which combines the earthy, chewy al dente rice with a fruity dressing and diced apples for crunch.\n\nGooey, baked on the spot chocolate chip cookies ($16) are blissfully good - so chocolatey it's like eating hot melted chocolate sandwiched between cookie dough. The accompanying stout milkshake is rich with just a hint of bitter stout to add another level of interest. Key lime pie ($16) comes in a distant second in its deconstructed form of lemoncurd, cookie crumbs and grilled meringue topping in a parfait glass. It tastes exactly as it sounds - okay, but not memorable.\n\nLuke's Oyster Bar is fuss-free, well-made American food that follows the mantra that good ingredients can speak for themselves without any mucking about. Yes, you pay a premium, but unlike its Gemmill Lane flagship, you have an enviable view of Orchard Road and it's one of a handful of stylish independent restaurants in the area that's worth revisiting. But if you really want to save some money, we hear Robinsons' bedlinen is a steal...\n\njaime@sph.com.sg\n\n@JaimeEeBT\n\nRating:\n\n7\n\nWHAT OUR RATINGS MEAN\n\n10: The ultimate dining experience\n\n9-9.5: Sublime\n\n8-8.5: Excellent\n\n7-7.5: Good to very good\n\n6-6.5: Promising\n\n5-5.5: Average\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Average new home prices in China fell for the first time in two years in May, while new construction slumped by nearly a fifth, adding to the drag on the economy.\n\nMoreover, the preliminary PMI survey's sub-index for employment pointed to jobs still being shed, though the pace of contraction eased from May.\n\nChina has set an annual target for the economy to grow about 7.5 per cent in 2014. A recent Reuters poll found that economists expected growth of 7.3 per cent for this year, which could be the weakest showing in 24 years.\n\nChinese leaders have ruled out the possibility of any massive stimulus to pump prime the economy as they tolerate a slower growth rate while pushing ahead with structural reforms.\n\nPremier Li Keqiang said last week that China's economy would continue to grow at a medium to high pace in the long term without strong stimulus. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/top-game", "site_title": "Top of the game", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nTop of the game\n\nHow competitive is Singapore as a financial centre? What would it take for Singapore to pip its rivals (particularly Hong Kong, London, New York City) for the global top spot?\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jun 22, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nNeeraj Swaroop\n\nChief Executive Officer, Singapore\n\nStandard Chartered Bank\n\nWE cannot underestimate the government's efforts in establishing Singapore as one of the world's leading financial centres in just over four decades. Singapore has taken all the right steps - English as the main language; having good infrastructure; stable political environment; common law; a deep global talent pool and attracting multinational corporations (MNCs) to set up business here - good reasons for it to be a premier hub for wealth management, private banking and commodities trading.\n\nUnlike the rest, Singapore does not have a huge domestic market. Hence, it positions itself as a regional centre and has done well in facilitating business between the East and the West (mainly the US and Europe). The opportunity for Singapore is to be THE international financial centre for Asean and can build on the North-South flows, especially between China and South-east Asia. Singapore knows individual markets in South-east Asia much better than the rest, so it can also be the gateway between Asean and India; and Asean and the Middle East.\n\nSingapore is on the right track, first by promoting the integration of financial markets under the Asean Economic Community, second by securing a spot on the world map of Islamic finance, and finally by being a yuan hub.\n\nIn addition, financial institutions like Standard Chartered can work even more closely with the government to identify new niche trends such as yuan and infrastructure financing, and tap these opportunities via Singapore. We will also continue to promote Singapore as a base for our clients' business and as the gateway to the region.\n\nAnnie Koh\n\nVice-President - Business Development and External Relations, Associate Professor of Finance\n\nSingapore Management University\n\nI DON'T think we want to pip London and New York as a global top spot in terms of being a financial centre or hub. We want to be up there with them and be a key financial centre in Asian time zones.\n\nSo Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam's call for finance professionals to be nimble and smart is timely. We need deep knowledge of regional culture and challenges, and also deep industrial knowledge (of trading and maritime finance activities) to complement our strengths in these areas, knowledge of infrastructure projects (power plants, solar energy, roads, ports and cities etc) and the understanding of where growth is coming from the region - growing middle-income wealth and cross-border financing challenges.\n\nBanking and finance is about financing human and corporate activities for the long term - so the ability to work with a cross-border network of central bankers, other regulators and knowledge and understanding of peculiarities (legal, cultural, political and religious) in diverse regional markets and alignment with global standards and requirements will serve to build Singapore's comparative advantage as a global financial centre. Think London and its role in Europe versus Geneva, Frankfurt and Zurich as regional plays linked to London as a global play.\n\nThen Singapore as a financial centre will shine as we work with regional financial centres to serve the unmet needs of the region and link our regional capabilities with global standards. We are at an exciting crossroads in the development of Singapore as a financial centre - and it is no longer enough to tap the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) or the Institute for Banking & Finance (IBF) alone to make this happen. The rest of the trade and tax and legal ministries and real business are partners to help build our competitive edge. A global financial centre links human activities and not just money.\n\nYeoh Oon Jin\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nPwC Singapore\n\nFOLLOWING the global financial crisis, it is tempting to look to the impact of the global reform agenda to predict the future shape of the financial services industry and how Singapore will fare as a leading global financial centre.\n\nHowever in our view, the more powerful forces impacting the industry are new technology and demographic megatrends. Innovative digital platforms and customer interfaces, rather than just information technology (IT) being the background infrastructure, will be core to financial institutions' new business models. Providing mobile solutions to reach new market segments and geographies will drive future growth for those who can leapfrog to a new technological model.\n\nWith growth in global trade flows shifting to the East and South, Singapore's strategic location and proven agility augurs well for greater dominance in global financial services - but the inertia of the broad and deep talent pools in London and New York must be overcome.\n\nAttracting international skills to Singapore may be part of the answer, but the key to success is encouraging local talent to develop cutting-edge technology, financial and risk expertise alongside the best in the world.\n\nMark Newman\n\nCEO\n\nING Commercial Banking Asia\n\nHAVING worked in three out of the four financial centres - London, Hong Kong and Singapore - it is clear that Singapore possesses strong fundamentals, despite an absence of a large domestic market.\n\nSingapore largely complements the other financial centres. The country's competitive edge is its ability to work with the global economy, as well as with emerging markets in South-east Asia which are becoming more significant. The region's commitment to establish the Asean Economic Committee (AEC) by 2015 will enhance Singapore's position as the gateway to the South-east Asian countries, further reinforcing its position as a key financial centre. The country also enjoys an unrivalled position as the region's commodity trade hub. Expertise in trade finance built up over the years will continue to be Singapore's strategic asset for a place among the top financial centres.\n\nING Commercial Banking has been operating in Singapore since 1987. Playing to the country's strengths as a key financial and trading hub, we have specialised teams based in Singapore with local and regional knowledge to support clients in this region, as well as European clients who are interested to expand into Asia.\n\nHugues Delcourt\n\nCountry Executive, ABN AMRO Bank NV Singapore and\n\nChief Executive Officer ABN AMRO Private Banking Asia & Middle East\n\nGIVEN its relative size, Singapore is highly competitive as a financial centre as demonstrated by its notable ranking among the top four global financial centres. It has built a dominant position as a regional trade hub and a critical mass of foreign and domestic banks. The country's robust regulation, transparent framework and corporate governance have been key elements of its success as an international financial hub. Regionally, Singapore's status as a safe haven has also nurtured its wealth management industry.\n\nImproving domestic competitiveness is important, but to enhance its long-term prospects, Singapore could look at focusing on external growth opportunities, to leverage on its ability to quickly adapt and move ahead with global consolidation and advances in technology. This includes continuously developing and attracting talent through education and training programmes to support its growth.\n\nOn the flip side, soft factors such as Singapore's thriving arts and culture scene and being ranked as one of the most liveable cities in Asia are plus points in its aspiration for the global top spot. Singapore should also continue to promulgate policies that support competitive costs of doing business and living as these are critical components in the overall scheme of the top financial centre rankings.\n\nPhilip Yuen\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nDeloitte Singapore\n\nWITH global financial centres accelerating their play in the world arena, the battle between these centres has become increasingly competitive. Using the incremental benefits approach is no longer proving effective in maintaining competitiveness, and Singapore should place bets around key trends that will impact the global economy. These trends can create interesting spaces and business strategies for Singapore's financial services industry to explore.\n\nIn order to harness these opportunities, Singapore should position itself as a financial centre that is in the thick of digital and fintech activity. This activity will no doubt increase with the growing importance to address the needs of trends like the rise of the ''uber'' economy, where the growth of the middle class results in constrained and shared resources; and where there are different government measures regionally and globally. In addition, the industry should develop innovative and unconventional B2B and B2C financial solutions to cater to the trend of the silver tsunami and meet the financial needs of a rapidly ageing world population.\n\nAlain Raes\n\nChief Executive, APAC & EMEA\n\nSwift\n\nFINANCIAL centres that will prosper will be those that define and leverage clear competitive advantage over others. Singapore has many advantages in terms of delivering world-class financial services, and one of those is the maturity of its payments and messaging processing infrastructure.\n\nIn today's rapidly evolving global markets, competitive financial centres need to have a solid, resilient, interoperable and scalable infrastructure to underpin any financial activity. For example, it is in part thanks to the strong financial infrastructure of MAS that Singapore has been able to absorb the growth in yuan transactions that it has seen in recent years. And thanks to use of international standards in this infrastructure, Singapore further elevates its position as a globally accessible financial market.\n\nAdded to that, geographically, it is the gateway to the Asean region. We believe that with a financially integrated system, Singapore could build upon its financial infrastructure and use it to enable growth in the regional market, thereby giving itself a competitive edge against other key global financial centres.\n\nLee Fook Chiew\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nInstitute of Singapore Chartered Accountants\n\nA VIBRANT accountancy sector is a fundamental building block of top financial centres. A trusted and reliable business environment, based on high quality financial reporting, is crucial to being a top financial centre. Investors rely on accountants to ensure the availability of accurate and reliable financial reports that are prepared and audited according to prescribed standards. This information serves as the basis for a wide range of business and investment decisions, and their accuracy and reliability are critical to the efficient operation of capital markets.\n\nTo boost Singapore's competitiveness as a global financial centre, we need to bolster the necessary talent, expertise and knowledge base in the accountancy sector, with its plethora of specialist pathways to business and finance. This will enable the accountancy sector to sustain the quality and standards of financial reporting and significantly raise business and market confidence, and to better support the financial sector in Singapore. In this respect, Singapore's goal of developing into a leading global accountancy hub is a step in the right direction, and should be leveraged on in its quest to be the top financial centre in the world.\n\nJohn Koh\n\nManaging Director\n\nWMRC Private Ltd\n\nTO eye the global top spot as a leading financial centre, Singapore would need to address both sides of the equation in terms of talent supply and demand. On the talent supply side, we need to continue developing more professionals to meet the ever-changing needs of the financial industry. Both academia and industry must continue working in tandem to roll out programmes which meet the needs of the industry, and the industry must continue to provide adequate jobs to graduates.\n\nMAS has done a great job in engaging with academia and industry but more needs to be done in designing incentive schemes and mentorship programmes to ensure that we have a continuous supply of strong talent in this area. The IBF and local universities such as SMU, NUS and NTU must continue collaborating at tertiary level so that knowledge and skills are constantly being honed and updated to meet new needs. Concurrently, the polytechnics and ITEs can do more to build up skill levels for entry-level jobs within the financial industry.\n\nThe present FICS framework is an excellent tool in promoting standards and certification, and more can be done to ensure a seamless flow of competency standards from our learning institutes to the actual workplace. We must continue to encourage financial institutions to consciously tap Singapore as their key regional learning hubs and to provide assistance for them to do so.\n\nSo far, firms such as UBS, Credit Suisse and BNP Paribas have set the examples but more can be done in attracting staff from regional offices of global firms to come to Singapore to learn new skills and contribute to our financial sector. Shanghai and Dubai are already hot on our heels vying for our fourth position, and we must not lose sight of the pole position if we are serious about being Asia's and the world's best financial centre.\n\nMark Micallef\n\nArea Vice-President, Asean\n\nCitrix Systems\n\nSINGAPORE is home to about 200 banks servicing both local and regional clients. Its stable political environment, excellent infrastructure and highly skilled professional labour force make it an attractive base of operations for global financial organisations - contributing to Singapore's growing role in the global financial sector.\n\nTo get to the top spot as a financial centre, Singapore must be able to offer the industry the best work environment to attract and retain the right talent. With the consumerisation of IT, there is a growing demand for Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) and flexible work schemes. Singapore's strong infrastructure network makes it easy for companies to implement mobility strategies such as desktop and app virtualisation, mobile device management and mobile app management that enable employees to work anytime, anywhere on any device. Workplace mobility can help financial organisations based here attract top talent, improve retention rates and increase productivity, while reducing real estate expenditure.\n\nLeong Soo Yee\n\nHead\n\nACCA Singapore\n\nIN the most recent report The Global Financial Centres Index 15 by the Z/Yen Group released in March 2014, Singapore remains as one of the top four global financial centres, together with New York, London and Hong Kong, and is also a major market judged as most likely to rise further in significance.\n\nAs a resource-scarce nation, Singapore depends heavily on talent acquisition, development and management to create more opportunities for enterprise while ensuring the country's prosperity. The future of Singapore's progress depends on how we maximise the use of our talents. For Singapore to continue to be an internationally recognised leader among global cities, employers should continue dedicating resources and investing heavily in this area to cultivate talents and to continue to build a strong talent base. Finance professionals should also continue to invest in themselves by expanding their skill-sets so that they are more prepared for what the future can bring.\n\nIn particular, as Singapore heads deeper into the 21st century, it is equally important to recognise the implications, challenges and opportunities brought about by new and emerging technologies in our quest to be THE global financial centre of choice for investors.\n\nThe world has entered what some regard as an era of ''Digital Darwinism'' where technology is evolving too fast for many individuals and organisations to adapt to changes. As the rate of change accelerates, accountants and finance professionals - who are active players in any financial centre - need to understand well, embrace and use emerging digital technologies such as big data; new, evolving and emerging Internet-enabled payment platforms; new methods of digital service delivery and the increasing use and acceptance of digital currencies. Singapore's rise to the top will be accelerated with the faster and more widespread use of these new technologies.\n\nA robust and transparent regulatory and business environment, sound governance and ethics, and a strong socio-political environment will also contribute towards Singapore's quest to be an unrivalled global financial centre.\n\nMax Loh\n\nCountry Managing Partner\n\nErnst & Young LLP\n\nWITH a longstanding strong reputation for ease of doing business; competitive tax regime; resilient physical, economic and social infrastructure; and a transparent and robust legal and governance system, Singapore remains competitive as a financial centre. Yet, risks of escalating real estate and living costs and stringent foreign labour policies that drive up business costs could well dampen its attractiveness.\n\nCompetitors such as Hong Kong, London and New York offer unique propositions that Singapore may lack inherently so capitalising on our niche strengths - including being the unrivalled gateway to the burgeoning South-east Asia region where East meets West with ease - will be important.\n\nThere are opportunities to further drive wealth management, yuan offshore trading, hedge funds and initial public offerings in Singapore. To that end, investments should be geared towards developing financial services and human capital with deep specialist skills complemented by a broad business outlook, and enabling a smart nation that promotes innovative technologies for growth in the sector.\n\nRajesh Yohannan\n\nManaging Director and CEO\n\nOanda Asia Pacific\n\nIT may not be trumpeted as such but Singapore is the financial gateway to the Asia-Pacific region. That was as true in 2008 when Oanda Asia Pacific opened its office in Singapore as it is today.\n\nIdeally located near China and Japan, Singapore continues to narrow the gap between itself and Hong Kong as the regional financial leader because of its stable political climate, excellent quality of life, its robust regulatory and legal framework and lack of corruption. Oanda's presence alongside other financial leaders here inspires investor confidence, and that in turn contributes significantly to Singapore's growth as a premier capital markets and wealth management hub.\n\nIt is difficult to pinpoint what might propel Singapore to the top as a global financial centre, but as a vibrant city-state located in the heart of Asia that boasts a ''AAA'' rated economy, it may soon surpass Hong Kong. Moreover, Singapore is home to more than 200 banks and it is one of the world's few recognised yuan clearing centres. Thus, Singapore continues to play an important role intermediating growing trade and investment between China and the rest of the world.\n\nJames Stewart\n\nGeneral Manager, Compliance, APAC\n\nWolters Kluwer Financial Services\n\nECONOMICALLY, Singapore is particularly well positioned to benefit as a place for doing business with its open business culture, low corporate and income taxes, natural strength in trade as well as being a trusted and reliable business centre with a talented pool of finance and banking professionals.\n\nAside from a stable political and economic environment, another key ingredient of a successful financial centre lies in its legal and regulatory framework and how it complies with international standards. This robust framework will not only elevate Singapore's competitive strength, it will also enable financial innovation generating new financial markets and growth opportunities.\n\nThe Singapore government demonstrates a strong commitment to promoting international cooperation and supporting new growth initiatives which will further entrench Singapore as a key financial centre. Singapore will also ensure that financial institutions are governed by the latest regulation to adequately safeguard and support the financial system. Although this will mean that institutions will need to ensure continued investment to comply to operate successfully in Singapore, it will ultimately ensure that Singapore will continue to be recognised as one of the top financial centres.\n\nPeter Scott\n\nGeneral Manager, Asia Pacific\n\nAvaloq\n\nSINGAPORE has raised the stakes and its status as a serious financial centre in recent years, outstripping the likes of Switzerland as the world's fastest growing wealth management hub, according to recent data. Owing largely to excellent connectivity, a world class information technology (IT) infrastructure and excellent local and foreign workforce, we expect this trend to continue. Consumers across the world - and especially in Asia - are becoming increasingly tech savvy, so it has never been more important for financial institutions to evolve in line with the technological revolution, in order to meet demand and stay ahead of the curve and the competition. The Singaporean government is committed to strengthening the city-state's positioning as a luminary in technology adoption, which I predict will continue to improve Singapore's ranking as a key financial hub in the future.\n\nJohnny Lu\n\nManaging Director, Asia Pacific\n\nGMC Software Technology\n\nWHILE Singapore ranks consistently in the reputation category of the GFCI, it would be beneficial for financial leaders to take a look at how their companies communicate with their stakeholders, specifically their customers and how to improve it. A 2013 survey on corporate reputation indicated that Singapore's banking sector had the best overall reputation, with customer perception having a critical impact on the sector's ranking.\n\nCustomer communication management (CCM) enables financial institutions to truly engage with customers, and more importantly, enables customers to interact with financial institutions how, where and when they want, through print, online or via a mobile device, as they wish. In our experience, using a multichannel approach for a highly personalised service can raise customer perception of brands and companies, and allow Singapore to set best standards in the industry.\n\nChris Mead\n\nRegional Director, Singapore & Malaysia\n\nHays Recruiting Expert Worldwide\n\nMANY employers in Singapore tell us that skill shortages remain an issue, and this is likely to limit its potential to surpass its rivals in financial services. Results from our Hays Global Skills Index published in 2013 showed that a low score for education flexibility (0.8) may negatively impact Singapore's ability to match the skills of graduates with the skills needed in the economy.\n\nA low score in education flexibility indicates that there is considerable scope to expand the output and quality of the local education system. Singapore's score of 0.8 does not compare favourably with Hong Kong (1.7), the UK (4.3) and the US (6.6).\n\nSingapore received a talent mismatch index score of 5.9. This relatively high score means that the numbers of long-term unemployed and vacancies are both increasing, suggesting that the available labour does not have the skills employers want. In comparison, Hong Kong had a score of 4.8.\n\nThe government's decision to push companies to consider locals above foreigners is good for the Singapore economy as a whole. However, due to the ongoing skills shortage, overseas talent is still needed to fill vacancies where local Singaporeans are in short supply.\n\nAng Swee Meng, Allen\n\nGroup Managing Director\n\nAldon Technologies Services Pte Ltd\n\nHOW competitive is Singapore as a financial centre? What would it take for Singapore to pip its rivals (particularly Hong Kong, London, New York City) for the global top spot?\n\nSingapore has a world-class infrastructure for financial services comparable to the world's top financial centres. Many of the elements of a global financial centre are in place including a transparent legal system, effective regulatory framework, sound financial institutions, strong banking system, reliable telecommunications services etc. However, there are other areas in which Singapore can improve. These include world-class standards of corporate governance, financial reporting, accounting and auditing practices and availability of specialised financial services talents.\n\nMany local companies have joint ventures with overseas partners and trade with partners from many countries. Many have become or aspire to be MNCs. They may need expert advice on cross-border forex, tax and risk issues and compliance with regulations of foreign jurisdictions. Most of the local companies use local banks. I think that in order for Singapore to be the top financial centre in the world, our local banks should build up their technical expertise in financial services so as to be able to advise local companies on complex international financial issues as they spread their wings overseas.\n\nFaisal Rafi\n\nManaging Director\n\nXchanging Singapore\n\nSINGAPORE has established itself as a regional financial hub, as evidenced by the high and growing influx of financial activity and foreign direct investments in recent years. However, in order to become more competitive on a global level, it is essential for Singapore to take the lead by harnessing technology that will allow financial services and industries (FSIs) to attain exceptional performance in aspects crucial to today's financial scene, such as intelligence and compliance.\n\nIntelligence is key in today's data-centric society, and FSIs need to shift beyond legacy systems and adopt technological solutions that enable real-time processing of information. Only by doing so will they be able to harness useful business insights, make well-informed investment decisions, and develop a competitive advantage that gives them an edge above the rest. Also definitive of today's financial scene is the need for regulatory compliance, which can be achieved by engaging the right solutions to maintain and ensure effective adherence to global regulatory standards.\n\nDeploying the right technology enables direct end-to-end processing and traceability of financial transactions - thus eliminating the need for large back-offices and ultimately driving greater speed, efficiency, cost-effectiveness and compliance for businesses. By providing investors with integrated technological infrastructure and a secure business environment, Singapore will thus be well-positioned to cement its spot as a global leader in the financial space.\n\nLeong Yee May\n\nSenior Vice-President\n\nOrange Business Services Asia Pacific\n\nIN 2013, the World Bank named Singapore as the world's most business-friendly economy for the eighth year running. Thus, not surprisingly, Singapore has been a preferred location for MNCs setting up their Asian headquarters. Singapore's attractive tax rates, strong legal system, and the use of English as its lingua franca, all contribute to its competitive edge as a financial centre. Furthermore, the emergence of Asean and India has provided additional incentive for businesses that wish to take advantage of Singapore's location as a gateway to Asia's next burgeoning economy.\n\nBesides traditional factors, Orange recognises the strengthening of bilateral ties between France and Singapore. Bilateral trade between the two countries almost tripled to $18.4 billion between 2001 and 2011. At 3.5 billion euros (S$5.9 billion), Singapore is also the second destination of French investments in Asia, after Japan. Cumulatively, Singapore was a natural choice for Orange's regional headquarters.\n\nAs seen in the latest GFCI report, leading Asian centres are faring significantly better than weaker regional counterparts. However, Singapore's ranking has stagnated, along with its scores in the various areas of assessment. To boost Singapore's competitiveness, improvements need to be made all around.\n\nIn enhancing ICT speed and security, the ongoing ICM Masterplan is a step in the right direction. With business operations increasingly conducted online, an extensive and reliable ICT infrastructure is paramount to Singapore's competitiveness. Also, in light of the recent tightening of labour and immigration laws, Singapore needs to invest heavily in its workforce so as to maintain, and even increase its supply of skilled labour. For Singapore to break through the ranks, it will need to evaluate itself in aspects beyond the economic in order to continue to attract investment and strengthen its position as a leading financial centre of Asia.\n\nChristophe Duchatellier\n\nCEO\n\nAdecco Asia\n\nSINGAPORE'S robust economy has resulted in it being a regional financial hub. A strong government, safe and secure business environment, along with its connectivity, infrastructure and business-friendly policies have made the country highly attractive to large multinational corporations (MNCs) and businesses. Clearly, developing economies are catching up and Singapore has to continue to look into innovative ways to attract the best talent here.\n\nSingapore is the second most competitive economy in the world - just behind Switzerland - in terms of attracting talent, and both government and business have to work together to further develop interest. Whether it is in talent attraction, building stronger and integrated infrastructure and business-friendly services, there has to be a continuous effort.\n\nMichael Smith\n\nCountry Director\n\nRandstad Singapore\n\nSINGAPORE is one of the most competitive financial centres in the region, with many industry players and financial institutions regarding it highly as a market with strong growth potential. Singapore is now home to over 200 banks, with a growing number choosing to base their operational headquarters here to service their regional network.\n\nHowever, for Singapore to claim the global top spot in the GFCI, the financial sector needs to ensure that it is developing a strong pipeline of potential leaders and skilled, worldly talent for future growth. The 2013/2014 Randstad World of Work Report found that 36 per cent of organisations in Singapore intend to hire more leaders in the next five years to ensure that they are competitive. Strong leadership is not only vital to maintain the regional and global competitiveness of financial institutions, but also Singapore's momentum as one of the world's leading financial hubs.\n\nTo be globally competitive, the finance sector should also expose its high performing employees to international opportunities to increase their knowledge of the region and the world beyond. Global exposure in areas such as bank management and financial regulatory standards can enable employees to gain more specialist knowledge which can then be replicated locally.\n\nAlan Leong\n\nVice President, Asia Pacific\n\nSilver Peak\n\nTODAY'S global realities demand that financial institutions and other organisations with global footprints be able to offer high quality service to customers across borders. This requires the ability to monitor, fine-tune, and respond to issues within a matter of seconds without any disruption to the business.\n\nAs the only South-east Asia country in the top 10 Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI), Singapore is in a strong position to leverage its regional leadership. The city-state can bolster its appeal as a financial hub by bridging businesses and boosting commercial connectivity within the region through the use of network technology.\n\nIn a region with differing standards of network connectivity, adopting technology such as WAN optimisation can ensure optimal data transfer rates between a financial hub and remote branches. With companies increasingly being measured on the end user experience, it is pertinent that Singapore factors in these considerations to stay ahead.\n\nVictor Foo\n\nCEO\n\nSingapore Precious Metals Exchange\n\nSINGAPORE, a well-regarded triple ''AAA'' rated economy, is a sound and stable location for investments and an attractive place for business opportunities. Looking specifically at the wealth management hub pillar, the nation is hailed as one of the best places in the world to store precious metals and the government is dedicated in making the country a precious metals trading hub. With the decision to remove the 7 per cent Goods and Services Tax (GST) on certified investment grade precious metals since October 2012, Singapore is definitely making leaps in its competitiveness as a precious metals trading hub.\n\nSingapore Precious Metals Exchange (SGPMX) currently serves over 15,000 global customers who not only buy physical precious metals on our platform but choose to store their gold and silver in Singapore. Since last year, we have seen average purchase amounts grow five times on our platform. Beyond being positioned to accommodate the growing demand for physical precious metals, an increasingly educated and skilled workforce would allow Singapore to rise to the global top spot.\n\nDavid Crammond\n\nFounder & CEO\n\nMaachu Pte Ltd\n\nSINGAPORE has in place the required infrastructure as a financial centre. However, it is constrained by the fact that there is no global Singaporean bank in comparison to their many established rivals who have headquarters or strong international presence in these three financial centres. In my view, in order for Singapore to step up to the top tier, one of the three Singaporean banks needs to step out in a meaningful way in North America and Europe. This would involve commitment to investment banking/trading/lending businesses in these regions. If managed properly, the impact will be a bigger Singapore footprint and increased revenue to the Singapore based bank(s).\n\nUnderpinning this, there needs to be an understanding that market liquidity ultimately defines the size and rank of a bank. The big three global centres are integral to global liquidity flows. Singapore needs to break into this league by expanding its risk appetite and breadth of markets traded here. From my experience, the trading desks in Singapore are generally risk constrained. This needs to change in order for Singapore to pip its rivals.\n\nNatalie Shuman\n\nSenior Vice-President, General Manager - EMEA & APAC\n\nKelly Services\n\nSINGAPORE is a global financial centre - at least judging from the number of global financial institutions that have regional presence in Singapore and the proliferation of hedge funds registered here. It has all the prerequisites that entitle other financial capitals to be successful global financial centres: free and open capital markets, a convertible currency, complete transparency with incorruptible and international standard regulation, and developed money and capital markets. It is also a financial hub for international capital flows in Asia.\n\nNevertheless, the volume of transactions consummated in Singapore pales in comparison with the transactions completed in London, New York and even Hong Kong. The two key distinctions between these financial markets and Singapore is the national currency and the plethora of financial instruments available to investors in those markets. The US dollar is the global currency numeraire. It is the currency that most transactions are denominated in and the currency that all cross rates need to be executed in. New York is the logical place to trade in US dollars. Moreover, it is the world's reserve currency. Since all central banks use US-dollar-denominated government securities as a reserve for their own currency, US government dollar bonds are the most heavily traded instruments. Couple this with the largest and most liquid equity market and the most dynamic financial instrument innovator, and it is no wonder why New York stands out.\n\nLondon is also a major centre, offering more securities in more currencies than any other single market. It has long been the biggest financial centre in the world. Hong Kong benefits from its entangled relationship with the Peoples' Republic of China and its access to a flourishing market for B shares of Chinese company stocks.\n\nIn contrast, Singapore lacks financial products. Its equity market is relatively small because many companies in Asia remain private or family owned. Its IPO market is immature. In addition, the Asian currency bond market is undeveloped. Many Asian countries have current account surpluses and therefore have not had to finance national deficits. Corporate leverage is provided by the banking system rather than the capital markets.\n\nHowever, optimism for Singapore's financial future is high and rests on the gradual use of the Chinese yuan becoming an international reserve currency. Singapore is one of three financial centres authorised to trade yuan offshore. As more international trade is financed in yuan and more central banks use the yuan as a reserve and engage in currency swap arrangements with China, Singapore will benefit from the increase in financial transactions denominated in Yuan.\n\nRavi Rajendran\n\nVice-President & General Manager, Asean\n\nHitachi Data Systems\n\nOVER the years, Singapore has established a comprehensive and robust infocomm infrastructure that has ensured our current competitiveness as a tech-enabled financial centre with next-generation technology capabilities.\n\nTo stay ahead, Singapore financial institutions need to recognise that IT decisions will no longer be made by traditional IT gatekeepers, and that business line managers and other front line executives will play larger roles in the IT decision making process due to their proximity to market needs.\n\nAs a nation, we also need to consider technology-centred skills training to support the adoption of emerging social innovation initiatives such as mobile payment applications or new technologies for fund transfers to ensure that we remain on track towards attaining a global top spot as a financial centre.\n\nGeorge McFerran\n\nManaging Director, APAC\n\neFinancialCareers\n\nSINGAPORE continues to thrive as a financial centre and is recognised around the world as a dominant player. To be competing with the likes of London, New York and Hong Kong after just four decades is an impressive achievement - but as the finance industry enters a new phase, Singapore should be prepared to evolve. It remains in a unique position to capitalise on Asia's growth and stay tapped into global financial markets, but planning for future change will be crucial to maintain a competitive edge.\n\nIt will require the same foresight and drive used to develop the sector here in the first place, to identify emerging opportunities as well as the areas set for long-term growth. It will also involve preparing tomorrow's graduates with appropriate skills and grooming junior bankers to be the next generation of business leaders by giving them more international experience, varied exposure and development programmes to actively manage their careers. This will help ensure that the future leaders of global financial institutions in Singapore are led by the home-grown talent. An industry with the best talent will thrive in tomorrow's world - and that is needed to achieve greater business sustainability and even reach the top spot.\n\nChris Comer\n\nCEO\n\nCastlewood Group\n\nAN economy's reputation is based on its ability to offer a well-regulated environment that offers a certain level of stability and predictability. Singapore can take a lot from London's drop in the index to Number 2, which was a direct result of the various scandals that undermined the reputation of London's financial sector - most notably the near-collapse of the Royal Bank of Scotland and the regulatory failure relating to PPI.\n\nPersonally, I think that Singapore has got everything in place to move up the ranking, our economy is rated ''AAA'', and we are located in one of the fastest growing regions in the world. Singapore fulfills a large number of the defining factors that ranks on competitiveness, however, Singapore needs to continue to look outside the box, and drive forward innovation. Similarly, we need to continue to adopt and evolve into new areas of operation such as legalising the Bitcoin currency, Singapore being the second country to do so after the US.\n\nIn the fast-changing economic landscape, we must ensure that we have a readily available skilled workforce to meet anticipated demands and take advantage of our strategic location to stay ahead of competitors. For Singapore to move up the rankings, it is crucial that we continue to self-regulate the market and offer a fair playing ground for all. While I understand the need to limit immigration to offer opportunities to the local community, additional changes to immigration policies shouldn't be taken lightly, and could be a hindrance to Singapore's growth as the country's skills shortages are well documented. Singapore has all the characteristics to compete at the top, but what will differentiate us is our ability to become an innovator, drive trends and become a market leader.\n\nKevin Wo\n\nSenior Vice-President & Asean Managing Director\n\nAvanade\n\nHOW competitive is Singapore as a financial centre? What would it take for Singapore to pip its rivals (particularly Hong Kong, London, New York City) for the global top spot? singapore's unique position as a hotbed for innovation, technology and banking raises its ante as a global financial centre. With technology evolving at lightning speed, the financial sector has also followed suit with mobile banking now a norm than an exception, as customers demand optimal experiences and services across a variety of channels. What will drive the next stage of growth will be the deployment of digitisation in the banking arena.\n\nFrom Avanade's perspective, this will be a game-changer - driving more engaging customer interactions, enabling a more mobile and collaborative workplace, and making processes more flexible. Smart banking technologies will allow banks to lower bottom-line technology costs, and deliver seamless customer experiences to improve customer loyalty and acquisition. For customers, this means more contact points with their bank. For banks, this translates to a deeper understanding of their customer base, and having the ability to offer a customised experience tailored to the individual. By intelligently harnessing the potential of new technology, financial institutions in Singapore will be able to achieve a competitive edge to remain relevant in this challenging landscape.\n\nJoshua Yim\n\nCEO\n\nAchieve Group\n\nFROM a macroeconomic perspective, the fastest growing area in the world is currently the Asia-Pacific and it is predicted to surpass that of the US and EU in the next five to 10 years. Against this backdrop, Singapore is strategically poised to capitalise on the economic growth and rising affluence in the region. Singapore should position itself as the Switzerland of the East, just as how Switzerland grew tremendously after World War II and became a financial hub for Europe.\n\nThere are a few cities vying to be a top financial hub in Asia, with Singapore and Hong Kong traditionally at the top. To supersede them as the financial centre of Asia, Singapore needs to have the right regulatory framework and infrastructure in place. Our strength has always been in the transparency of our financial system and we should continue to uphold this reputation.\n\nThe Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges have struck an alliance lately, and Singapore should perhaps strike an alliance with one of the bigger stock exchanges in the Asia-Pacific, such as Tokyo. This is one suggestion that would bring a big influx of money into our economy and propel Singapore up a few notches. Of course, it will have to be very strategically executed, and a lot of mechanics and details will have to be worked out.\n\nNext, we should look at tweaking our talent migration policy. A lot of financial talents from the US and European countries that are not experiencing much growth will want to move to Asia where the strongest growth prospects are, and Singapore is a very attractive option for them due to our cosmopolitan culture. So our regulators may want to take another look at our migration policies if Singapore wants to strengthen its position as a financial centre.\n\nAnnie Yap\n\nManaging Director\n\nAYP Associates Pte Ltd\n\nSINGAPORE has been consistently ranked fourth on the Global Financial Centres Index behind New York, London and Hong Kong. Its competitive edge is mainly attributable to factors such as human talent, government transparency and infrastructure. The gap between Hong Kong and Singapore is closing by fewer than 30 points on a scale of 1,000 on the GFCI, and countries such as Japan and Shanghai are catching up. Singapore continues to be well-regarded as an ''AAA''-rated economy with growth potential. Being an international financial centre which is strategically located among a region of opportunities, Singapore can offer a pro-business environment that is cost competitive.\n\nAreas where we can continue to grow on our strengths include constant development of skilled and diverse pool of human talents, technological innovation and trade linkages.\n\nDora Hoan\n\nCo-Chairman/Group CEO\n\nBest World International Ltd\n\nI FEEL that Singapore has room for improvement compared with her rivals. Singapore has the advantages of being a systematic and orderly financial centre. Yet, it may be too orderly with the stricter rules and regulations that it has implemented. Unlike Singapore, its rivals have vibrant investment market and capital funds. Therefore, the companies listed in these places may attract a better P/E ratio. Furthermore, the cost of listing and maintaining are about the same in Singapore and the other financial centres. Therefore, Singapore is not as attractive compared with them.\n\nDumont Jean-Michel\n\nChairman\n\nRuder Finn Asia\n\nTHE boon of globalisation driven by cutting edge technology is as impactful to the financial industry as its bane. Coupled with the West-East shift in capital flows and the emergence of Asia's economic might in a marketplace that is increasingly complex and highly regulated, the demand for specialised skills has become more imperative, with communications as one form that is clearly understated and its importance overlooked.\n\nCommunicating strategically is crucial in a world with no borders and when all stakeholders' interests are intertwined. It requires very specialised skills and capabilities that encompass a 360-degree perspective, financial knowledge, understanding how the global markets work, where each stakeholder's interests lie, a sound grasp of the political, economic and social issues of the day and the ability to interpret which can boost or thwart any capital market activity or financial centre's well-being.\n\nAttracting and developing these talents and leveraging them to build Singapore's image as an international financial hub is a critical component to getting to the top spot, but that said, it has to be complemented and aligned with further deregulation of Singapore's financial markets.\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nSINGAPORE has a strong reputation as a financial hub but it is true that the country risks losing its competitive edge as other cities catch up while we face certain domestic challenges. Professional services are at the core of the banking and finance sector so the biggest threat may be the tightening of our foreign labour laws, which constricts the talent pool and consequently, limits growth in this sector. If we cannot import the necessary foreign talent that can help develop and evolve our range of financial services, then as a country, we will have to look into developing the core and specialist skills required among our own pool of Singaporeans.\n\nThe MAS, which governs the finance sector, also plays a key role in determining the growth of this industry. It needs to strike the right balance in its policies to enable growth while having the necessary controls in place to prevent bubbles from forming and ensure a stable and resilient economy.\n\nBeing such a small economy, it is not easy to unseat top global financial centres like London and New York that cater to much more sizeable markets. Our competitiveness will thus have to come via our talent pool supported by a favourable framework that includes sophisticated infrastructure and business-friendly policies.\n\nToby Fowlston\n\nManaging Director, Singapore\n\nRobert Walters (Singapore) Ltd\n\nIN this tight labour market, the largest competition within Singapore as a financial centre is securing local talent. The Fair Consideration Framework to be implemented this August has enhanced an already candidate-driven employment market. Financial institutes are revising their career progression, training and skill development plans to groom existing employees for present and future opportunities. The areas of competitive recruitment include risk, regulatory change, governance, internal audit and compliance as a result of tightened regulations in financial services. In addition, there is a big initiative for attracting overseas Singaporeans from both organisations and the government. We believe their exposure to international projects as well as Asian experience will be a unique edge to the Singapore workforce.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPlan-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\nSINGAPORE must resist the temptation of trying to become a follower to close the competitive gap between Singapore and Hong Kong, London and New York, in that order. While I agree that more can be done for Singapore to improve on achieving the pre-requisites for a leading financial centre, such as diverse and well-developed financial services; a robust stock market; market resilience; and the standard characteristics of a business hub such as connectivity, infrastructure and business-friendly policies, I think that Singapore should devote more of her efforts to be a leader in shaping and introducing new dynamics and attributes of a top financial global hub, going forward.\n\nE-financing and e-banking offer an excellent opportunity for Singapore to take the lead in this space and to leapfrog the other three members of the Big Four. There is much to be done to make this more prevalent and pervasive, as an alternative to traditional services. It is not just about regulatory controls to facilitate this - which are needed - but a whole gamut of services and offerings to make it easier for businesses and consumers to transact in cyberspace.\n\nRegulatory controls alone will require new thinking and innovative ways of combating problems such as money laundering through payment gateways or e-commerce platforms. Singapore can tap some of the initiatives in our Smart Nation Platform to become the top nation to offer holistic financial and banking services. I am confident that Singapore can achieve this breakthrough, much like what we have achieved with our water recycling capabilities and capacity. We must have the talent pool to achieve this - it is just as important as the specialist skills required for structured trade finance, risk management and knowledge of the region.\n\nLaletha Nithiyanandan\n\nManaging Director\n\nTalent Design Potential\n\nFROM a purely business perspective, it doesn't make sense for Singapore to pitch itself against New York and London as these are established ''Goliath'' markets. Instead, Singapore should continue to capitalise on its position as a bridge to Asia and aim at being the best in the region. Singapore's success from its founding days can be attributed to its position in the region and globally as a trading hub. As long as Singapore can remain competitive and relevant in attracting and retaining good business, we can continue to excel in our position as a financial centre to be the best in Asia.\n\nBut staying competitive and relevant is a challenging task especially in a controlled economy like Singapore. In the business matrix, we rank top in good government, location and infrastructure. However, Singapore also needs to continually develop its position as a talent hub (local or foreign) diligently for this sector. Talent can transcend geography and therefore anchor Singapore onto the global stage if we are able to attract, engage and retain the best and brightest brains in this business.\n\nStree Naidu\n\nVice-President\n\nImperva Asia Pacific and Japan\n\nSINGAPORE is recognised globally as an established financial hub. The nation's efficient legal framework and favourable tax regime have created an attractive operating environment for global and local financial institutions. However, in order to maintain its status as a leading global financial hub, Singapore will need to anticipate market changes and future needs. Data security will play a critical role in the future of financial services sector and should be a key consideration for both private and public sector decision makers.\n\nToday, financial services are becoming more information-based and technology-intensive by nature. This increased dependence on data and technology brings about the challenge of securing and protecting critical data. As threats continue to evolve, it is no longer enough to rely on basic security software. Financial institutions must employ skilled experts in data security and compliance, and work with a strategic security partner like Imperva to secure data at its source - within the data centre. With these measures in place, Singapore can continue to improve its competitiveness in the financial services industry.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

E-House China Holdings Ltd, a Shanghai-based property brokerage, has plunged 13 per cent while online property listing website Leju Holdings Ltd has lost 18 per cent. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index rose 0.1 per cent to 104.69 last week in New York.\n\nChina's new-home prices fell in half the cities tracked by the government for the first time in two years. Sales growth at all three companies will be less than half the pace of 2013, analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. Agents in Shenzhen are threatening to boycott SouFun over the cost it charges for listings, the South China Morning Post reported on June 19, a week after Deutsche Bank AG cut the stock to hold, citing concern discounts on fees will erode profit.\n\n\"You'll see price reductions, commission reductions and a market that's weak with reduced levels of transactions,\" Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at New York-based Solaris Asset Management LLC, which manages about US$1.5 billion in assets, said on June 20. \"A correction in housing tends to be an extended event, especially when there's been excessive speculation and significant overbuilding.\"\n\nYiwen Zhang, an investor relations representative at SouFun, didn't respond to a request for comment made after regular business hours in Beijing last week.\n\nThe iShares China Large-Cap ETF, the largest Chinese exchange-traded fund in the US, slipped 0.7 per cent to US$37.83 last week. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index climbed 1.4 per cent to a record as investors speculated economic growth will accelerate.\n\nChina's new-home prices fell in 35 of the 70 cities tracked by the government for the first time in two years, according to a statement by the National Bureau of Statistics June 18. That was the highest number since May 2012.\n\nDeutsche Bank analysts led by Vivian Hao cut their rating on SouFun from buy on June 12, saying in an e-mailed research note that there is a \"fair chance\" the company will lower its 2014 earnings guidance because of its plan to discount some listing fees by 40 percent. SouFun hasn't decided whether it will adjust its revenue guidance, Vincent Mo, SouFun's chairman and founder, said in a conference call with analysts June 17.\n\nThe housing sector \"is in need of a correction and the Chinese government is well aware of that,\" Mr Ghriskey said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

Officials at Qingdao port could not be reached.\n\n\"Warehouse receipts are not title documents; they are documents of entitlement. But they are being used as title documents for sales and purchase and transfer of ownership,\" said a person at a warehouse company with operations in Qingdao. \"Everywhere else outside of China, a warehouse receipt is cut for one party.\"\n\nA bank source with direct knowledge of Qingdao said warehouse firms should bear the brunt of responsibility, while a senior official at a warehouse firm said responsibility \"remains very much up in the air\".\n\nA lawyer who has been involved in litigation over fraudulent warehouse receipts said banks' primary recourse would be against whoever forged the receipts. \"But if the fraudster is gone, the bank may decide that it wants to go against the warehouse,\" said the lawyer, who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nA warehouse operator and a banker said agreements with clients meant there could be limited liability for a cargo, capping a payment at around US$100,000, depending on specific terms and conditions. For example, a shipment of 10,000 tonnes of copper would be worth about US$68 million at current prices.\n\nEven if banks or their customers have insurance for the metal, some warehouse sources said they might struggle to get paid if fraud is uncovered or their agents are implicated. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Now, we're also seeing the reverse: Chinese state-owned enterprises and private enterprises are coming out of the country and into the Asean region. And we want to serve them in this region and capture that work coming out of China into Asean.\"\n\nAnd Myanmar is one of the hottest investment destinations for investors in Asean these days. \"The international business community's interest in Myanmar is unprecedented,\" Ms Eng notes.\n\nWongP has, before this, already been acting for both Myanmar and foreign business interests in transactions involving a range of sectors. For example, it recently advised Singapore's Pan Pacific Hotels Group in its Yangon hotel development joint venture, and also Malaysia's Parkson Retail Asia on the expansion of its network of well- known Parkson department stores into Myanmar, via a joint venture with Singapore's Yoma Strategic Holdings and First Myanmar Investment Company.\n\nAside from corporate transactions, the firm is also advising on construction and infrastructure projects.\n\nBut it felt the need to be closer to the action. Ms Eng notes that clients' need for legal advice has been acute with the country's investment laws being drafted even as the investments are carried out.\n\n\"It's an opportune time for us, given that the legal sector there is currently underserved - there are few established lawyers (in Myanmar) at this point in time. It's good for us to get a foothold early.\n\n\"There's a lot of potential in that market: they have 60 million people, and are wedged between China and India. We have a China practice and an India practice, so this (Myanmar office) is part of connecting all the dots,\" Ms Eng says.\n\nWongP currently has some 270 lawyers with offices in Singapore, Abu Dhabi, Beijing, Doha and Shanghai. In addition to its India and China practice, it also has a Middle East, Thailand and Asean practice. Last year, it announced a tie-up with Malaysian law firm Foong & Partners. \"That (the tie-up with Foong & Partners) has worked out very well. So our Myanmar office is the next point for us in Asean.\"\n\nWongP is, of course, not the only Singapore law firm setting up shop in Myanmar. Neither is it the first - nor, indeed, is it likely to be the last. Rajah & Tann, for example, has a Myanmar office, which is part of its Indo-China network; Allen & Gledhill has an associate office in Yangon staffed by local lawyers; and Kelvin Chia Yangon, part of Kelvin Chia Partnership, is said to be the oldest international law firm in Myanmar.\n\nIt's expected that the Singapore legal presence in Myanmar will only increase with time, as the volume of investments there grows. It also makes sense for local law firms to build up their regional presence, with the Singapore legal services market now open to greater foreign competition.\n\nMs Eng says WongP is holding up well to foreign competition, however. \"We compete and, in some instances, collaborate with the QFLPs (foreign law firms holding a Qualifying Foreign Law Practice licence, which allows them to practise certain areas of Singapore law). Since this is our home base, we have specialist teams who are extremely familiar with our regulations and regulatory trends. QFLPs who do not have expertise in such areas continue working with us.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They were followed by Hong Kong and Japan.\n\nAndrew Cannane, Perpetual's general manager of corporate client services, said: \"It is no surprise to us that Australia and Singapore come out on top in this survey due to their strong regulatory framework, reporting, valuation guidelines and governance in relation to related-party transactions.\"\n\nThe regulatory certainty and several additional favourable factors make the two markets the most preferred in the region for investors in Reits, he said.\n\nThe other features that investors look out for when investing in a Reit include:\n\nReits have grown significantly as a new and popular investment class in the region. Since the launch of the first J-Reit on Sept 10, 2001, the market capitalisation of Asian Reits now exceeds US$140 billion. Including Australia, market capitalisation of Asia-Pacific Reits is around US$170 billion.\n\nThose surveyed (94.7 per cent) do not think there should be a limit to foreign ownership of a Reit.\n\nAbout half feel that management should not have a minimum equity stake in a Reit, but if the Reit manager does have an interest, most said the maximum threshold they will be comfortable with is 15 per cent.\n\nAbout six in 10 don't think a Reit should be allowed to invest in non-property assets or businesses like construction or hospital management. Seven in 10 feel there is no need for Reits to hedge against investments in assets outside the country of listing.\n\nAccording to the report, countries that do not yet have Reit markets are missing out on a share of a growing pool of Reit-dedicated capital.\n\n\"What is clear from this report is that the share of this capital will also be influenced by the extent of confidence in and the integrity of the regulation of a Reit market. It will also be influenced by the approach to tax and tax efficiency, a reason why amongst the larger Reit markets in the region Hong Kong lags behind Australia and Singapore,\" it said.\n\nAprea is a non-profit industry association that represents and promotes the real estate asset class in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The yield on 2018 debt of China Overseas Land & Investments Ltd, the nation's largest developer by market value, dropped to 3.35 per cent last week, from a record 4.31 per cent on Feb 5, while that on similar-maturity bonds of China Vanke Co fell to 3.95 per cent, from an all-time high of 5.07 per cent on March 20.\n\n\"We will pick the winners from these trends,\" said Stephen Chang, head of Asian fixed income at JPMorgan Asset, which oversees US$39 billion in emerging-market debt. \"Although sales and prices are falling along with margins, we have identified the larger developers are gaining market share and executing well.\"\n\nPremier Li Keqiang has pledged to safeguard this year's growth target of 7.5 per cent, fuelling bets the government will encourage increased lending to selected projects and relax restrictions in the real-estate market. Larger developers may benefit from industry consolidation as smaller builders face a funding squeeze with a record amount of property trusts maturing next year and prices falling in the most cities in two years.\n\nHome prices declined in 35 of China's 70 cities last month from April, the most since May 2012, official data showed on June 18. In the financial centre of Shanghai, prices decreased 0.3 per cent, the first drop in two years, while they fell 0.2 per cent in the southern business hub of Shenzhen.\n\n\"Softening prices are good because they imply there isn't a bubble any more,\" said Ken Hu, Hong Kong-based chief investment officer of fixed income for Asia Pacific at Invesco, which manages US$787 billion globally. \"We pick developers with high turnover and those who tend to build smaller-sized flats. Profit margin isn't that key to bondholders like us. Our approach is to buy on dips.\"\n\nDevelopers including Vanke that cut prices by 10 per cent to 15 per cent achieved good sales volume, Deutsche Bank AG analysts led by Hong Kong-based Tony Tsang wrote in a June 13 report.\n\nVanke, headquartered in Shenzhen, recorded a 16.2 per cent increase in sales value in the first five months of 2014 from a year earlier, it said in a June 3 statement to the Shenzhen stock exchange.\n\nLarger industry players are able to tap overseas capital markets for funds. Sales of dollar bonds by Chinese companies totalled US$91 billion in 2014, compared with US$89 billion in the previous year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nSmaller builders, which rely on property trusts for financing, have to repay 203.5 billion yuan (S$40.8 billion) in 2015, according to research firm Use Trust.\n\nThat's almost double the 109 billion yuan due this year. China's banking regulator said on June 6 it will monitor developer finances, a sign of concern defaults may spread after the March collapse of Zhejiang Xingrun Real Estate Co, a builder south of Shanghai.\n\nChina South City Holdings Ltd, which runs logistics parks for industrial materials, sold one billion yuan of five-year bonds at a coupon of 7.5 per cent in the interbank market on May 9. It plans to use the proceeds to repay short-term bank loans.\n\nGreenland Holding Group has hired banks to arrange investor meetings from yesterday for a potential dollar bond offering, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nVanke's bond borrowing costs dropped to 3.45 per cent on a weighted average last week, compared with 5.5 per cent in the first quarter of 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It also managed to extend the average maturity of its notes to 3.95 years, from 2.43 years in 2011.\n\nSlowing growth is causing declines in the yuan and onshore interest rates. The Chinese currency has fallen 2.8 per cent against the dollar this year, the worst performance in Asia.\n\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond has dropped 52 basis points to 4.04 per cent in the same period as investors sought safe havens.\n\nGross domestic product (GDP) will probably expand 7.3 per cent this year, the slowest pace since 1990, according to a Bloomberg survey.\n\nThe downturn in the property market will be more prolonged this time than in previous corrections, Tom Byrne, senior vice-president at Moody's, said at a June 19 conference in Shanghai.\n\nBroad price cuts are likely to come in late August or in September when more new projects are set to be introduced, UBS AG Hong Kong-based analyst Eva Lee wrote in a report last week. Moody's revised its credit outlook for Chinese developers to negative from stable on May 21.\n\nThe Shanghai Stock Exchange Property Index, which tracks 24 real-estate companies listed in the city, has slumped 6.3 per cent this year, exceeding the 4.2 per cent decline for the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index.\n\n\"Overall, the housing market is cooling in some parts, like in third or fourth-tier cities,\" said Mr Chang at JPMorgan Asset. \"But we do see a silver lining. There's actually a healthy pick-up in transactions at specific locations after some discounting.\"\n\nThe nation has introduced measures to help the real-estate industry, which JPMorgan Chase & Co says poses the biggest near-term risk to growth in the world's second-largest economy. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) told 15 banks in May to improve efficiency of service, give timely approval and distribution of mortgages to qualified buyers. The south-eastern city of Fuzhou has removed home-purchase limits for buyers who make one-time payments, the Securities Times reported on June 18, citing sales people from two developers.\n\nThe government may announce additional \"minor stimulus measures\" after Premier Li said in London last week that the nation will maintain a minimum growth rate of 7.5 per cent, according to a China Securities Journal commentary on June 20.\n\nThe PBOC may release more targeted steps to prevent expansion from falling short of the goal, it added.\n\nA preliminary Purchasing Managers' Index for manufacturing was 50.8 for June, HSBC Holdings plc and Markit Economics data showed yesterday.\n\nThat compared with a final reading of 49.4 in May and the median estimate of 49.7 in a Bloomberg survey of economists. It's the first time this year that the figure exceeded 50, signalling expansion.\n\n\"Policymakers are actually putting out more measures to support this sector,\" said Arthur Lau, Hong Kong-based head of Asia ex-Japan fixed income at PineBridge Investments, which oversees about US$71 billion. \"I think, volume-wise, it could catch up a little bit in the second half, especially those who are not aggressively buying land.

By the end of this year, there will be about a million call centre workers in the Philippines, he said.\n\nThe overall outsourcing industry brought in US$15.5 billion to the Philippines last year, and this is on track to hit US$25 billion in 2016, he added.\n\nTo compete with other countries, call centres are racing to upgrade its staff so that they don't get caught up with the race to the bottom of the price list.\n\nThe centres are equipping staff with technical training, so they can handle support calls for IT services.\n\nMore are also trained with business diplomas and degrees, said Mr Mercado. \"Ten years ago, the call centres here did basic customer service and provided stuff like directory lookup. Today, they do higher level technical support, and the centres hire people with Cisco certifications, they hire sales people, and people who can handle insurance and finance work,\" he said.\n\nAnd the IBPAP has its eye on the next technology frontier already. He said that big data and analytics are hot areas of focus for many customer-facing call centres, and being able to offer sophisticated customer relationship service can provide a huge edge for a call centre.\n\nA worker adept at handling customer relationship management (CRM) software can see in front of him the profile of a customer on the other line. This can help save time so that the service staff doesn't have to ask unnecessary questions about what the customer's set up is, and by running analytics on the spot on the customer's buying history, a skilled worker can even introduce the customer more products down the line based on what he might need, Mr Mercado explained.\n\n\"Just that personal touch, without asking those questions. People calling in feel good, like their (service provider) knows them personally. That's where the future of the call centre is going,\" he said.\n\nIn April, The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) revealed that India is losing 70 per cent of its domestic outsourcing business to the Philippines, particularly to call centres.\n\nThe trade association said that workers in the Philippines have the edge over the majority of Indian workers in terms of education and their command of the English language.\n\nThe cost of that business is estimated at USS$30 billion in foreign exchange earnings, said Assocham.\n\nPatricia M Abejo, director of ICT industry development and cyberservices at the Information and Communications Technology Office, from the Philippines Department of Science and Technology, said that the government body is trying to create more awareness of these skills, and of training in the rural areas of the country.\n\nAbout 70 per cent of the Philippines' potential labour pool is estimated to be outside Metro Manila, in its provinces and fringes.\n\nRather than encourage people to move to bigger cities, the government is hoping to facilitate better remote workers who can work either from home, or central Internet facilities that are available in provinces, said Ms Abejo.\n\nShe pointed out that more than 50 per cent of the people on global remote working site Elance.com, for example, are from the Philippines. \"There are 155,000 Filipinos on Elance,\" she said.\n\nAccording to figures from Internet World Statistics, the number of Internet users in the Philippines grew to 41 million in 2013, up from 33 million the year prior. It has a mobile penetration rate of 111 per cent, and two-thirds of mobile users have smartphones.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

UOB economist Francis Tan told BT: \"The first line of impact will be an immediate uptick in inflation. On the business side, transport costs will rise with petrol prices. The transport and storage sector will see a big hit first, and that will affect the wholesale and retail trade segment. Households will also see higher electricity tariffs, and they could scale back on consumption.\"\n\nAdded Mr Supaat: \"There could be a reduction in production and even exports. All this would eventually impact consumption and our growth trajectory . . . There's also the risk that (the events in Iraq) will affect sentiment. It's a double-whammy of things that may affect Singapore's GDP.\"\n\nSeveral economists highlighted that all this would only serve to exacerbate rising business costs here - which would in turn weigh on growth.\n\nBarclays economist Leong Wai Ho estimates that if oil prices hit US$130 per barrel, Singapore's current account balance would drop by 0.7 percentage points. Bank of America Merrill Lynch's (BAML's) Chua Hak Bin thinks that a 10 per cent increase in oil prices would lower Singapore's GDP growth by 15 basis points, and increase the consumer price index by 10 basis points.\n\nStill, Credit Suisse economist Michael Wan thinks that elevated oil prices will only have a knock-on impact on core inflation \"at the margin\".\n\n\"The first round of (risk to inflation) still comes from the tight labour market. The underlying issue is not so much oil prices, but more the structural moderation in labour supply.\"\n\nAt the same time, unlike countries such as India and Indonesia - whose fuel subsidies and price controls would exacerbate already-swelling current account deficits - economists say that Singapore is better protected against the impact of higher oil prices.\n\n\"Although Singapore would also experience a big impact given the external reliance of its economy, its large current account surplus should insulate it from a balance of payments shock,\" noted Mr Leong.\n\nWhile Singapore may not be as badly affected as its neighbours if the situation in Iraq worsens, economists are still staying alert to any second-degree impact that could occur, should the region suffer. After all, as a large net importer of oil, Asia is vulnerable to steep price increases.\n\nBut Dr Chua also believes that Asia is \"generally in a stronger position to weather an oil price shock this year\" compared to last September when the Syria crisis erupted, citing improving current account deficit positions and moderating external debt ratios.\n\nStill, economists like Mr Supaat, Mr Leong, and Dr Chua were keen to stress that things are still \"manageable as of now\".\n\n\"We're not being affected in a big way yet because things haven't escalated. Right now, it's still far too early to conclude that (the instability in Iraq) is going to have a big hit on growth,\" said BAML's Dr Chua.\n\nAdded Barclays's Mr Leong: \"All of what we are saying is just simple analysis. A regime change in Iraq is the risk scenario, because it will mean prolonged disruption. But it also takes quite a bit of geopolitical risk to push this into a persistent price increase - it doesn't take into account the Saudis stepping in to supply more, or governments supplying more from their own strategic petroleum reserves. So there are mitigating factors.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

If you look at the market capitalisation of Internet companies, they are huge. China's Alibaba is worth almost US$300 billion, while Tencent, which owns WeChat, is around US$150 billion.\n\n\"Our target of US$3 billion may be a small fraction of that, but I do believe it can grow. We started the company with just RM2 million in 1999 and have invested RM150 million so far to expand.\n\n\"Today, we have presence in 14 countries and are expanding in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa,\" he told Malaysia's Business Timesrecently.\n\nThe company, which owns MOL AccessPortal Bhd, a global online payment service provider, is also targeting growth in Europe, although cautiously.\n\nMOL's major profit contributor is MOLPoints, which is an all-in-one online currency for games, content and services.\n\nThe company is 73 per cent owned by Mr Tan, Malaysia's 10th richest man with a net worth of US$1.3 billion, and his family.\n\nGroup chief executive officer and co-founder Ganesh Kumar Bangah and the Sultan of Johor own 12 per cent and 15 per cent of the company, respectively.\n\nMOL will be the first South-east Asian company to carry out an initial public offering (IPO) in the US in more than four years. The IPO will raise US$300 million, and one-third will be utilised for working capital purposes, Mr Tan said. \"The balance of around US$200 million will be returned back to me and my family as we dilute our shares for the listing.\"\n\nMr Tan said that after listing MOL, he and his family will own less than 50 per cent of the company, the Malaysian daily said. The stakes held by the Sultan of Johor and Mr Ganesh will be cut to 14 and 10 per cent, respectively, he said.\n\nMr Tan recently listed convenience store operator 7-Eleven Malaysia Holdings Bhd in a US$250 million IPO.

Just what do you do during the 75-minute lull between the two games? Sleep, and you're more than likely to wake up only long after the sun has risen.\n\nBut those who have sacrificed their 40 winks to witness the action unfurling some 12,000km away in 12 Brazilian cities have been rewarded handsomely.\n\nIt helps that most of the 3am kickoffs have been absolute crackers. Just yesterday morning, Germany and Ghana battled to a scintillating 2-2 draw, with the unfancied African side even threatening to snatch the win right at the death against the European powerhouse.\n\nThe previous day in that time slot, France and Switzerland served up a surprising seven-goal thriller, while last week we witnessed Chile stun the world by eliminating defending champions Spain.\n\nUruguay sent England home early as well after a two-goal masterclass by the talented Luis Suarez. Why, there was even a goalless draw that had everyone glued to the telly as Mexico fended off hosts Brazil for 90 minutes, thanks to a heroic performance by goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa.\n\nThere's something magical about this World Cup that is able to draw people out of bed to their living room sofa in the middle of the night. Thousands of people islandwide have also swarmed to nearby community centres or a McDonald's outlet to make sure they don't miss out.\n\nThey all know that each of the 64 games has the potential to deliver something special - yes, even the likes of Costa Rica, Croatia, Ecuador and Colombia, all of whom have exceeded all expectations by playing attractive football and scoring exquisite goals along the way.\n\nWith all this, it's easy to forget that the tournament is still at the group stage. It's probably safe to say that the best is yet to come, with the knockout rounds coming up this weekend.\n\nThat's when we'll likely see some games needing 30 minutes of extra time or even the dreaded penalty shootout to decide the winner.\n\nBy the time this column sees print, I would have just landed in Washington, DC on a work trip. I hope my schedule will allow me to sneak in a match or two, since they would start at the much saner times of noon and 4pm - perfect for watching the action during lunch at the hotel or at one of the many watering holes in the area.\n\nIt almost makes me want to start saving up now so that I can fly to Russia for the next World Cup in 2018, when most of the games will start in the late afternoon and around dinner time.\n\nCome to think of it, that doesn't sound like too bad an idea, actually. Sure, that trip won't be too kind on my wallet - but my well-rested body would certainly thank me later on.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We hope it will be within this year or next year - not too late because the window is closing on us. Other funds are going in as well,\" he said in an exclusive interview.\n\n\"We see Europe as a potential growth area. Almost three four years ago, the prices were ridiculously high. The same properties we are seeing right now have dropped quite a bit in prices. The yield now makes sense,\" he added. \"That does not mean that later on, we will not set up other equity funds that could be China-centric or Asia-centric.\"\n\nFrasers Hospitality is building a \"hotel residence\" in Frankfurt and rebranding an existing hotel in Barcelona under its \"Capri by Frasers\" brand - a hybrid concept that combines the full range of hotel facilities with the flexibility and conveniences of full serviced residences.\n\nIt is undertaking due diligence in Germany's Berlin and Hamburg as well as in Italy, in view of a huge demand for hotel residences in Europe.\n\nMr Choe noted that there is a surge in the number of companies relocating younger single executives, whom he referred to as \"the road warriors\", rather than senior executives with families, given shrinking corporate budgets. This is contributing to Capri's popularity, though it just started 11/2 years ago.\n\nThe firm has five brands: Fraser Place, Fraser Suites, Fraser Residence, Capri by Fraser and Modena, which is currently focused on China.\n\nGiven the parent FCL's plan to beef up its investment properties, FHGL was set up last October with a broader mandate to venture beyond serviced residences.\n\nFHGL could go after greenfield projects, brownfield or half-fitted projects, conversions of office buildings into hospitality assets, or operating hospitality assets.\n\nFor a start, FHGL made an A$100 million (S$117.5 million) acquisition of an office building in Brisbane's CBD last year and is converting it into Capri Brisbane. A lacklustre office market and a shortage of hotel supply in Australia has presented such an opportunity for the change in use of office buildings.\n\nElsewhere, FHGL snapped up the five-star hotel Sofitel Sydney Wentworth for A$202.7 million last month.\n\nMr Choe noted that Australia remained a \"safe market that could stand the test of time\" despite recent softness in the mining, oil and gas industries, key pillars of its economy.\n\nFrasers Hospitality's properties in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth are almost full-house now; it still has \"some breathing space\" before a major industry supply comes onstream. A report this year by Deloitte noted that hotel occupancies in Australia could push further into record territory.\n\nMr Choe said there are also many heritage buildings in Europe that can be renovated and transformed into hotels or serviced residences.\n\nFHGL will \"incubate these assets\" and eventually inject them into the hospitality Reit, Frasers Hospitality Trust (FHT), which just lodged its prospectus yesterday. FHT's initial $1.66 billion portfolio consists of six serviced residences from FCL and six hotels from FCL's major shareholder TCC Group.\n\nMr Choe said Frasers Hospitality remains on track to double its assets to 30,000 rooms in five years. \"We would like to add a piece of the jigsaw puzzle that we don't have - that is, the USA,\" he added. \"We are looking aggressively to see how we can enter the market.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Many are unwashed and still have grass stains on them.\n\nAmong them is a shirt issued to Ray Houghton for the famous 1-0 victory over Italy in 1994 in which he scored the winning goal and Damien Duff's top from the 2002 World Cup round of 16 when Ireland lost to Spain on penalties in 2002.\n\nDuff swapped it with new Barcelona manager Luis Enrique, who gave it to Rojack.\n\nAs to the value of a garment worn in a World Cup, Mr Rojack said that it can be hard to estimate, adding: \"Generally you can't properly ascribe a long-term value to a World Cup shirt until the tournament is over. For instance, Suarez's shirt from the England game is worth a lot today, but in a month's time that could go up or down depending on what happens in the rest of the tournament.\"\n\nSuch items are neither easy nor cheap to get hold of, even for experienced collectors. \"Roughly speaking, a good World Cup shirt might set you back anything from 400 euros (S$679) to 1,000 or 2,000 euros. That assumes you can get one, and are satisfied the provenance is good.\"\n\nFor collectors, the biggest problem in the market is establishing that what they are being offered is the genuine article, and not a forgery. \"Sourcing shirts is not easy. The best way is through the player, their agent or family, or through an administrator within the relevant football association,\" said Mr Rojack.\n\nThe collector added that online auctions can be a good resource, but that \"there are an awful lot of fakes available online\".\n\n\"Generally, the shirts players wear are significantly different to ones you buy in the shops,\" the 35-year-old said. \"It goes from things like larger sponsor's and player's names and numbers to less obvious things like the type of material used, the country of manufacture, the embroidery used on badges.\"\n\n\"One common fake you see is a replica shirt which has been 'dressed up' to look like a match shirt,\" he said, adding that he pores over photographs and match videos to establish the authenticity of prospective purchases before buying. \"Think about a classic Renaissance painting - not only is it possible to fake them, many genuine paintings have been incorrectly ascribed as fakes and vice versa,\" he said. \"So trust and research can only reduce risk, not eliminate it.\" - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

The amount includes the stocks, infrastructure and land that are held by Wearnes Automotive.\n\nBut despite the valuable property and prestigious franchises in its stable - among them Bugatti, Bentley, McLaren, Range Rover and BMW - the bidders are said to be more comfortable with a price tag of about 30 per cent less than the asking price.\n\nThis is because at $450 million, the price-earnings ratio is close to 20, or higher than an automotive player like Jardine Cycle & Carriage, which has a P/E ratio of 13 to 14 and is not only a retailer but also a distributor and assembler of vehicles.\n\nStill, any one of the four bidders could be willing to meet the price, depending on how well they believe the Wearnes purchase fits in with their current business.\n\nSwire Pacific, which owns Cathay Pacific Airways, has a company distributing various makes in its home base, Hong Kong, as well as in China and Taiwan. It recently became a Volkswagen dealer in Malaysia and is said to be keen on expanding in the South-east Asian region.\n\nOUE is a hotel and property company whose executive chairman Stephen Riady plans to leave the motor operation to a successful Singapore car distributor while he focuses on Wearnes' various property holdings here.\n\nThe Malaysian car group is big in China as a distributor of a make of high-end sports car but is interested in acquiring more brands to expand its reach.\n\nAs for Al-Futtaim, the United Arab Emirates conglomerate which owns the Robinsons department store also has a major automotive business dealing with Japanese brands.\n\n\"The parties are interested and have been poring over the financials but the price remains a sticking point because of the relatively low and uncertain returns from the business,\" said a source. \"As you know, the whole market is down. So it looks like it will be left to the one with the most cash to swoop it up.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/mmmm-4", "site_title": "Mmmm 4", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nMmmm 4\n\nThe turbocharged BMW M4 Coupe comes with a higher fun factor. By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 20, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nONE look at the BMW M4 and it could be mistaken for a dressed-up 4 Series Coupe. But examine this latest evolution of the M3 Coupe more closely and you will notice it is an almost totally different car. The new nameplates for the 3 Series Sedan and 4 Series Coupe models have resulted in the M3 Sedan and M4 Coupe. But given that the M division modifies virtually every bit of the car, the link between the respective models is small.\n\nFor a start, only two body parts of the M4 have been carried over from the 4 Series - the doors and windows. Everything else is different, from the aluminium bonnet and front fenders, to the carbon fibre roof and boot lid, which has a subtle integrated ducktail spoiler.\n\nThis intense focus on shedding weight - the 1,500 kg M4 is 80 kg less than its predecessor - is done to enhance agility and controllability.\n\nFor example, lightweight aluminium is used extensively for the front suspension, while the new rear five-link set-up has forged aluminium.\n\nThe drive shaft is carbon fibre, and so is the new U-shaped front strut brace, which attaches the axle subframe to the body. At the back, the rear axle subframe is connected to the bodyshell motorsport-style without the use of elastic rubber elements for greater rigidity and hence directional stability.\n\nThe front is two cylinders lighter now because the previous naturally aspirated 4.0-litre V8 has been replaced by a brand new 3.0-litre turbo inline six-cylinder unit - the first time this compact high-performance model has employed forced induction. More interestingly, maximum torque jumps nearly 40 per cent to 550 Nm.\n\nThis means the M4 has a newfound lightness with the two small mono-scroll turbos producing lag-free response. Floor the accelerator and the high-revving straight six responds immediately with a brand new sound. It grunts at lower speeds and rasps loudly further up the rev range, accompanied by an angry exhaust growl when the electronically controlled exhaust flaps are opened to minimise back pressure.\n\nThe engine's lightweight magnesium dry oil sump is also taken from motorsport. Its suction pump ensures oil is effectively supplied under high-G cornering on the track.\n\nOn the road, the body control is impressive. The M4 is rock solid at high speed and extremely planted in sweeping bends. The fat rim of the beautifully stitched leather steering wheel is wonderfully reassuring, as is the Active M differential, an electronically controlled limited-slip rear differential to prevent wheelspin in tight corners and increase traction.\n\nTogether with the optional carbon ceramic brakes (a first for the M3/4), the weight transfer under heavy braking is less and the fun factor is much higher. Where the V8 M3 Coupe may have been noseheavy for amateur drivers going into a fast corner, the front end now feels more obedient.\n\nThree modes - Comfort, Sport and Sport Plus - can be separately chosen for the engine, steering and suspension. The seven-speed M DCT double clutch transmission which connects the engine to the rear wheels also offers three levels of gear shift speeds. Together, their variability produces two extremes of driving experiences - from quiet and languid, to focused and more aggressive - and everything else in between.\n\nWith these capabilities, this fifth-generation M car has become even tighter and sharper. In M3 Sedan or M4 Coupe form, the 2,812 mm wheelbase is identical and so are front and rear tracks, although the M3 Sedan is taller. But what's nice is that both can be used just as easily on the road during the week and on the circuit over the weekend.\n\nsamuelee@sph.com.sg\n\nSPECS\n\nBMW M4 Coupe\n\nEngine\n\n2,979cc inline-6 turbocharged\n\nGearbox\n\n7-speed M DCT dual-clutch transmission\n\nMax power\n\n431 hp @ 5,500-7,300 rpm\n\nMax torque\n\n550 Nm @ 1,850-5,500 rpm\n\n0-100 kmh\n\n4.1 secs\n\nTop speed\n\n250 kmh\n\nCO2 emissions\n\n194 g/km\n\nPrice\n\nfrom $236,800 (without COE)\n\nDistributor\n\nMunich Automobiles\n\nTel\n\n6899 6996\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Mr Ng used to run The Humble Loaf, a 10-seater bakery and sandwich counter in Katong Shopping Centre, which Mr Heng, a stockbroker, patronised weekly. When Mr Ng's handmade sandwiches in flavours such as short rib with gruyere and pulled pork with kimchi pears started drawing in constant queues, the two men - who had become friends over Mr Heng's eight months of patronage - decided to team up to open a larger outfit.\n\nMr Ng shut The Humble Loaf in April and will open five-times-as-large Gastrosmiths in a tenanted space within the Marrison Hotel in Bugis next month. There, the At-Sunrice GlobalChef Academy-trained Mr Ng will serve up more substantial European comfort fare with Asian accents, such as an Asian risotto made with Japanese rice and monkfish stew, a Marmite-laced porridge topped with mushrooms and poached eggs, and grilled cod with ee fu noodles dipped in vinegar. Lunch sets go for $15 to $20 while average spend per person for dinner should range from $25 to $35.\n\nBesides having seats for 40 - including al fresco - Gastrosmiths will also have a retail kiosk a few paces away. On-the-go office workers can take away sandwiches and Highlander-roasted signature blend of Arabica coffee for lunch, or drive by to pick up homemade cakes and pies on their way home.\n\nThere's ample parking space along adjacent Tan Quee Lan Street, so linger around for a while to watch Mr Ng and his team whip up homemade confectionery in their open concept pastry kitchen.\n\n\"Because everything is individually handcrafted here, no two items will look alike,\" adds Mr Ng.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

P&O Ferries' fuel bill will rise by \u00a330 million (S$63.8 million) a year, which it said it would pass onto customers.\n\n\"On longer routes, fares will need to rise more than on shorter ones to cover the greater increase in fuel costs,\" P&O Ferries chief executive Helen Debbie wrote in a letter to staff, which was seen by Reuters.\n\nThere is also the risk that some firms will find it cheaper to pay fines for not complying with the limits than pay upfront capital costs to change fuels or fit technology.\n\n\"The potential for not following the regulations is there, because you can save a lot of money. It is so significant that over time, companies in compliance may not even be able to compete with companies who are not in compliance,\" said Mads Stensen, global adviser on sustainability at Maersk Line.\n\nBritain-based ferry group Red Funnel has been using low-sulphur fuel for 18 years, however, and a spokeswoman said that the company has maintained its competitiveness through efficiency improvements.\n\nApart from the costs, there is also a lack of clarity about how enforcement will work. Each EU member state is responsible for deciding its own methods of enforcement including penalties, according to the European Commission. - Reuters\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

BNP Paribas will probably plead guilty early next month to a criminal charge of conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the person said.\n\nTerms of a settlement aren't final, although the two sides have reached a broad agreement in principle, said the person.\n\nLeslie Caldwell, head of the US Justice Department's criminal division, and bank officials spoke on Friday about the potential resolution, the person said.\n\nCesaltine Gregorio, a BNP Paribas spokeswoman in New York, declined to comment. Brian Fallon, a Justice Department spokesman, didn't immediately return an e-mail message seeking comment after business hours.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported the broad settlement terms earlier. BNP Paribas would be temporarily banned from handling transactions in US dollars, probably for a matter of months, and would announce departures of more than 30 employees, many of whom already have left, the newspaper said.\n\nThe settlement would make BNP Paribas the second major European bank to plead guilty in the US this year. Last month, Credit Suisse Group agreed to pay US$2.6 billion, the largest penalty in an offshore tax case, after using secret Swiss accounts to help Americans hide money from the Internal Revenue Service. Its main banking unit pleaded guilty to a criminal charge.\n\nInvestigators in the US had sought at least US$10 billion to resolve the probe of BNP Paribas, people familiar with the discussions have said.\n\nUS authorities first learned about possible wrongdoing by BNP Paribas around 2007, when an informant contacted the Manhattan District Attorney's office. The bank conducted its own investigation and about a year later came forward with its findings, people familiar with the matter have said.\n\nHSBC Holdings agreed to pay US$1.9 billion in 2012 to resolve a sanctions-violation and money-laundering investigation, while it avoided a guilty plea by admitting wrongdoing as part of its accord. That had been the largest settlement for doing business with sanctioned countries.\n\nUS prosecutors argued that a more severe penalty against BNP Paribas was justified because the misconduct was more egregious and the bank didn't fully cooperate with the investigation, a person with knowledge of the matter has said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Our goal is to expand the base of buyers into cities like Jakarta and Bangkok,\" JLL managing director for Singapore and South-east Asia, Christopher Fossick, said in an exclusive interview.\n\n\"We would also like to expand into some Indian cities and Chinese cities.\"\n\nAccording to Mr Fossick, investors prefer proximity and familiarity when choosing where to put their money, which is why many have invested in more transparent and mature markets such as London.\n\n\"In 2013, we started selling Tokyo properties. I think 2014 onwards, we will see more products from America, from New York and San Francisco, and more properties from Australia - Sydney and Melbourne in particular,\" he said.\n\nJLL's capacity to serve its clients in the region was boosted when it opened a new office in Malaysia following a 49 per cent stake acquisition in YY Property Solutions Sdn Bhd this month. The Kuala Lumpur-based transaction and advisory firm has since been rebranded as JLL Malaysia.\n\nMr Fossick explained that the acquisition was \"opportunistic\" in nature to capitalise on the relaxation by Malaysian government on the cap for foreign equity in real estate.\n\n\"This is not due to a change in market outlook or opportunities in Malaysia,\" he said. \"We are not taking short-term views. We think that Malaysia is a country that will continue to grow and provide opportunities.\"\n\nJLL is hoping to double the team there from the current staff strength of 40 over the next two years. The team will focus on office leasing in Kuala Lumpur and investment sales. It will also look at providing residential sales services in the capital city.\n\nElsewhere in the region, Jakarta and Manila are the other hot spots, Mr Fossick said. Manila is growing as a business process outsourcing (BPO) centre and there is demand for residential upgrading. The demand for mid-priced affordable apartments in Jakarta from Indonesians is also picking up.\n\nAs for Singapore, which remains JLL's largest South-east Asian market, the residential market is becoming more challenging. But leasing demand for office space in both centralised and decentralised locations is supported by steady corporate growth and a balanced supply, Mr Fossick said.\n\nThere will be limited new office supply in the central business district until 2016 onwards when Marina One, the mixed-development in Marina South, Guoco Tower in Tanjong Pagar and mixed-use Project Jewel in Changi will come onstream.\n\nMr Fossick has been working in Asia for 25 years since he joined CBRE's Singapore and Asia office leasing teams and later became president and CEO of CBRE Japan, before joining JLL in Singapore in 2006 in his current role.\n\nJLL has made a string of acquisitions here in the past few years. In 2011, it acquired DST International Property Services, which markets projects in Asia-Pacific, the US and the UK and in 2012, bought Credo Real Estate, which specialises in collective sales. Last year, JLL acquired boutique firm Halcyon Real Estate to beef up its strength in project residential leasing.\n\nThe success of these acquisitions came in the form of a 50 per cent jump in profits in Singapore. Strong market performances in Jakarta and Manila also aided a 33 per cent profit growth in South-east Asia.\n\n\"2013 had an exceptional growth that is hard to repeat,\" Mr Fossick said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It has not hit a target since 2008.\n\nAnother miss could put the brakes on plans by the US Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to spend billions of dollars to improve the Boeing-led Ground-based Midcourse Defense system (GMD), and add 14 more interceptors to the 30 already in the ground in Alaska and California.\n\nUS defence officials, lawmakers and outside experts agree the GMD programme - projected to cost US$41 billion - must be changed, even if yesterday's test succeeds.\n\nUnder discussion is additional funding for maintaining interceptors and improving their reliability, more testing of components and the entire system, and upgrades to improve the system's ability to tell actual missiles from decoys. There will also be different fee structures to provide Boeing with incentives for improvements in quality rather than cost-cutting.\n\nOfficials at Boeing, the Pentagon and MDA declined comment on the contractual changes under discussion.\n\nThe programme, long a political football for US lawmakers, remains the only US defence against long-range missiles that could carry chemical, biological or nuclear warheads.\n\nSupporters say the system is making progress under Navy Vice-Admiral James Syring, who took over in November 2012 from Army Lieutenant-General Patrick O'Reilly.\n\nBut the multiple test failures and a harsh review by an independent group commissioned last year by MDA have spurred a drive to restructure a seven-year Boeing contract that began in 2011, and the initial contract it has held since 2001, according to sources briefed on the review. The aim is beef up the system's quality and reliability.\n\nThat review has not been released, even to Congress, and details are being closely held.\n\nLed by former military officials, the review blasted MDA's move away from a rigorous \"systems engineering\" approach and more frequent testing that would have boosted reliability and quality, and could have helped avert last July's test failure, according to the sources familiar with the situation.\n\nPentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall in February said \"a lot of bad engineering\" was found while investigating the July test failure and two previous ones in 2010.\n\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee in its fiscal 2015 budget added US$30 million in funding for reliability and maintenance improvements to the GMD programme, saying it was aware that the independent review had revealed deficits in that area. Congress will finalise the budget plans later this year.\n\nOne source familiar with the programme said he was \"shocked\" to see the lack of attention to reliability, risk management and ensuring precise production practices. He said the contract with Boeing was structured poorly, providing the company with greater fees for cutting costs than improving quality and reliability.\n\nRiki Ellison, who heads the non-profit Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, said GMD's problems were due to \"misguided\" decisions around 2009 to scale back testing, reduce funding and cancel work on a new kill vehicle, the part of the system that hits an enemy missile. The moves were part of the Obama administration's early efforts to reduce tensions with Russia and focus more on regional defence, he said.\n\nOne senior US official said Pentagon leaders are confident that Vice-Admiral Syring is taking the steps needed to put the programme on track, and put appropriate incentives in place for Boeing.\n\nThe defence and aerospace company, which had already earned over US$18 billion on the GMD programme since 2001, beat out a combined Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Co team to continue managing the programme when MDA opened the programme to competition in 2011. Boeing is teamed up with Northrop Grumman Corp on the new contract.\n\nThe company is hoping to resume deliveries of replacement interceptors, which were halted by MDA after a test failure in July 2013. That failure occurred when a Raytheon kill vehicle failed to separate from the third stage of the rocket and thus missed its target.\n\nVice-Admiral Syring last week told a Senate hearing that MDA had identified the cause of that failure, and would fix all 30 interceptors before year end. Deliveries would resume if the test succeeded, he said. He said Boeing's incentive fees had been docked after the test failures, but gave no details.\n\nAnother test failure would likely put a hold on 14 additional interceptors the Pentagon plans to order, putting US$1.05 billion in potential orders on the line for Boeing. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Maker's Los Angeles-based staff create their own content, but most of the company's revenue comes from its creator network.\n\nIn March this year, Disney announced that it had offered US$500 million in cash and stocks for the company, plus an additional US$450 million performance bonus.\n\nRiding on this high, Maker embarked on global expansion proper in May, opening a Singapore office as its South-east Asian hub. Hong Kong is likely next, and Australia too, according to reports.\n\nMr Rechtman joined the company half a year ago, coming over from AOL to oversee the company's international growth plans.\n\nHe said: \"We have 720 million views monthly right now in South-east Asia. In a year, that'll be three or four times that volume.\"\n\nAnd the number of Asian eyeballs will only continue to grow, he said. The growth of Asian audiences, as mobile Internet devices continue to spread in the region, will \"hit the traditional value chain\" of passive TV \"even harder than what we've seen so far\".\n\n\"We believe this region will be our biggest in the next 18 months,\" he said.\n\nThe idea of the mobile as the \"second screen\" is often erroneous in Asia's emerging markets, where it is the \"first screen\", instead. People are preferring to consume personal entertainment on tablets and mobile phones, and TVs are being relegated to just the consumption of live events, said Mr Rechtman.\n\nHe said that the volume of video consumed here is 70 per cent done through mobile phones - the highest proportion globally. In comparison, the average audience outside of South-east Asia watches about 40 per cent of online video on their phones.\n\nAn estimated 60 per cent of Maker's viewership comes from outside of the United States, say reports.\n\nAccording to online sources, Maker's 50,000 channels attract approximately 5.5 million page views a month, making the network one of YouTube's largest.\n\nYouTube videos typically earn between US$1 and US$3 per thousand views, and successful videos within Maker's network roll into the tens of millions of views. Maker takes about 16 per cent of the ad revenue, with YouTube owner Google taking 45 per cent, and the content creator takes the rest.\n\nMany of the YouTube creators that stand out in Maker's roster are individuals, often with basic setups and who produce content from home.\n\nMr Rechtman said these creators are appealing to audiences because of their authenticity. Likening them to reality TV shows, he said mass audiences started to feel fatigued with regard to reality TV because they could tell how staged the programmes were. \"When you follow one of our YouTube stars, they feel like they're your friends, in the way they look and the way they speak.\"\n\nOver in Asia, the amount of talent is also growing, he said. \"When we first started working in the region about two to three years ago, there were so few video creators. Now, it's booming.\"\n\nBecause of the growing pool of audiences watching video online, it's natural that advertisers are following them to the platform, he added.\n\n\"All I hear from big advertisers is, 'How do I stay relevant to people under 34?' Traditional brands are worried about not appealing to young people,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By KENNETH LIM\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jun 22, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nQT Vascular\n\nFollow\n\nCAN profitability ever be bad for a company? Yes, if it comes at the expense of long-term sustainability, according to Eitan Konstantino, chief executive of loss-making QT Vascular.\n\nBut Mr Konstantino has a plan. He reckons that the inflatable catheter maker just has to double its sales before shifting its focus to positive earnings.\n\nRecent approval to sell a key product in an underserved segment should give a boost to achieving that goal, but in the meantime growing sales and investing in research will remain the priority, Mr Konstantino said.\n\nFor some investors, QT Vascular's latest quarterly headline results may not have seemed impressive.\n\nFirst-quarter net loss attributable to shareholders widened significantly to US$9.2 million in the three months to March 31, dwarfing the year-ago loss of US$4.1 million. But part of that loss came from a US$2.4 million non-cash fair value loss on financial instruments, while listing-related professional fees added US$2.1 million to administrative costs.\n\nMr Konstantino is concerned that those numbers could turn off investors in Singapore, which have not historically had a lot of experience with early-stage medical device companies.\n\n\"We saw mixed feedback from the market on our Q1 results,\" he said. \"Some people were very happy with the increase in revenue, some people were not so happy because we still had losses from Q1. And my message is, the most important right now, in the next year and a half to two, is to grow, grow, grow, grow, grow.\"\n\nFor a company like QT Vascular, profitability can wait until the company's products, many of which are still in development, have established a stronger beachhead, the CEO said.\n\n\"You know, start-up companies are a little bit different, because for mature companies, their focus is naturally profitability and bottom line,\" Mr Konstantino said.\n\n\"For start-ups, the focus is growth. How fast they can grow, how much penetration, how much business you can take from others? . . . Later on, when you get to a different critical mass, you can turn to profitability.\n\n\"It's important to signal to the market this is by choice. Because you can decide to turn profitable earlier, but what you really want to do is increase revenue and reinvest in R&D to be on the cutting edge of technology. And we believe that by doing that, we will provide the best return to our shareholders.\"\n\nThat is why Mr Konstantino is proud of QT Vascular's latest topline numbers. Sales of its Chocolate PTA Balloon Catheter jumped during the quarter, helping revenue to grow by more than 41/2 times, to US$2.8 million during the quarter as the company stepped up sales efforts for the surgical treatment of narrowed arteries.\n\nIf QT Vascular can keep up those sales, they would imply annualised revenue of US$12 million for the year. Mr Konstantino said he was reluctant to focus on achieving profitability until yearly sales hit US$30 million to US$35 million.\n\nMr Konstantino is hoping to get to that threshold a little faster now that QT Vascular has just obtained approval from the United States to market its catheter as a treatment for coronary heart disease.\n\nMr Konstantino believes that the approval will allow QT Vascular to capture two important trends.\n\nThe first is a gradual shift away from implants such as stents amid concerns about complications that can arise whenever a foreign object is left inside the body. The balloon catheter, which is typically extracted once it has done its job of expanding a narrowed artery, satisfies that preference.\n\nThe coronary treatment field is also relatively mature with high approval hurdles, and medical device makers have looked elsewhere for lower-hanging fruit.\n\n\"First, it's a much larger market and, second, it's a market that did not observe enough innovation in the past, probably 10 years other than iterations of stents. So in a way it's a more mature market with less players and less competition on the physician's time in the catheterisation lab,\" Mr Konstantino said.\n\nCIMB analyst Gary Ng is a believer in Mr Konstantino's thesis.\n\nIn a recent note, Mr Ng called the coronary application a \"game changer\" for QT Vascular that would give the company access to a market worth about US$8 billion worldwide. The analyst expects QT Vascular to be profitable in 2015.\n\n\"QT Vascular's product adoption globally and exclusive partnerships with reputable distributors will propel revenue,\" Mr Ng wrote. \"Pipeline creations and staggered approvals are keys to transforming this early-stage incubator into a serious contender in the global vascular market, which should lead to maiden profits in FY15.\"\n\nMr Konstantino said QT Vascular plans to market the coronary product on its own initially before looking for larger distribution partners if the product takes off quickly.\n\nIn the meantime, QT Vascular continues to maintain a pipeline of development products. The company this year plans to seek European approval for a drug-coated version of its non-coronary catheter. It is also developing a non-metallic version of the catheter that could potentially halve the cost of its product and make it more attractive for hospitals to use.\n\nQT Vascular's initial public offering in May raised S$55 million, and it has given the company a comfortable capital cushion as it continues to grow its business, Mr Konstantino said.\n\n\"We think we are well capitalised,\" he said. \"We don't see that we are going back to the market soon for any of the items that were listed in the use of proceeds. Now, if we decide to do inorganic growth or acquisitions or partnerships, that's a different story. But for our bread and butter, for our day-to-day, we have more than what we need.\"\n\nkenlim@sph.com.sg\n\n@KennethLimBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By May Yip\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 20, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nBLAME it yet again on Kate Middleton, the relatable trendsetter who doesn't so much as break fashion rules as quietly puts her own spin on classic favourites. Thanks to the Duchess of Cambridge, headwear has become stylish statement-makers rather than traditional accessories, fit only for royalty.\n\n\"Demand for hats has grown after the Royal Wedding,\" observes homegrown milliner Mandy Pan, who picked up the craft after coming across the works of Jane Taylor, the go-to milliner for the Duchess. \"Many people think that you can only wear a hat to special occasions but that's nonsense. You can wear a hat anywhere. It just depends on the hat design.\"\n\nApart from major horse-racing events such as the annual Singapore Airlines International Cup, during which eye-catching hats are usually donned, an increasing number of women are sporting loud toppers for themed parties, company dinner-and-dances, and weddings. In fact, there are at least four locally based hat-makers who craft the accessories by hand - despite the less-than-mainstream appeal of headgear here.\n\n\"I am getting more and more customers who are placing custom orders for hats to wear to special occasions such as weddings in exotic locations,\" says Chee Sau Fen, who has worked for more than 15 years in the visual arts and events industries before starting her hat label Heads of State Millinery three years ago. \"Other customers are fashion leaders who usually grab our first prototypes in every collection and keep close tabs on the 'works-in-progress' photos from our sewing table which we post on our Instagram feed and our Facebook page.\"\n\nThe self-taught designer creates hats by sewing upcycled materials such as men's ties or abaca, a handloomed fabric that can be shaped by folds and stitches, rather than traditional hat-making methods of applying heat, moulds, glues, stiffening chemical sprays and wires to shape designs.\n\nMs Pan, on the other hand, picked up her more classic hat-making skills from Rose Cory, a one-time Royal Milliner in the UK. \"I have lived in Australia for eight years and worked in the tourism sector. Very often, I was invited to horse-racing events such as the Spring Racing Carnival,\" recalls Ms Pan, who stitches and creates all the trimmings on her hats by hand.\n\n\"This was to be my first exposure to race hats and I started buying and wearing them. And when I saw (British milliner) Philip Treacy's gravity-defying hats in magazines, I was intrigued and started searching for hat pictures online.\"\n\nWhile outre, intricately-crafted hats might be experiencing a fashion moment only now, homegrown hat-makers have been developing a love of pillboxes, fedoras and fascinators for years.\n\nAnother local milliner, Kristine Hakim, kickstarted her obsession with stylish hats while exploring a passion for vintage fashion. \"A couple of years ago, I was very much inspired mainly by burlesque artist Dita Von Teese and the iconic Marlene Dietrich, and I started dressing up in vintage styles,\" says the owner of Mandarin Gallery boutique Eskpade, who picked up her hat-making skills from British milliners and books. \"Then, I was asked to make some headpieces for magazine shoots when I was in Indonesia and I realised that I really enjoyed it, and hence decided to pick up the craft professionally.\"\n\nFor now, millinery training is still only available abroad. Ms Hakim suggests enrolling in colleges in London, while Ms Pan notes that Australian hat-makers are more innovative than their British counterparts at the moment and recommends courses with established milliners from the continent. And, as Ms Hakim adds: \"If one is passionate enough, one could learn from books, the Internet and mere observation.\"\n\nBut the easiest way to satiate a love of headpieces is to simply incorporate them into one's wardrobe. Unlike toting a bag of the moment or tottering around in the season's trendiest shoes, however, wearing a hat does require a sartorial eye. \"Asians tend to have wider faces, so the most flattering way to wear a hat is to tilt it to the side,\" advises Ms Hakim. \"This will create a slightly elongated line, adding height and visually slim down the face.\"\n\nUnlike mass-produced hats available off the rack from high street stores, such handcrafted designs don't come cheap, with prices starting from $200 for a simple design. The hefty price tags, however, are justified by the amount of skill and effort that go into the creation of the head-turning pieces.\n\nMs Pan, for example, requires at least three weeks' notice for a custom order and mainly attracts customers through word of mouth rather than other forms of publicity, since she could not keep up with a larger volume of orders. When selecting a hat, pay attention to the piece's fine details to determine its quality and craftsmanship, adds Ms Chee, who started her company after winning a creative enterprise business pitching competition by Asia On The Edge, a regional ideas incubator.\n\n\"Stitches should be invisible except when they are decorative,\" adds Ms Chee, whose hats are also sold at multi-label boutiques such as The Society of Black Sheep at Marina Bay Sands. \"There is a sense of lively spontaneity in how the trims are attached. Nothing feels like it is sewn down rigidly. There is lightness and grace where lines and edges flow and float, defying gravity.\"\n\nBut local ladies are still apprehensive about wearing hats. \"When you wear a hat, the head and face becomes the focal point and you get lots of attention,\" she says.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Buyers outweighed sellers with 16 companies that recorded 30 purchases worth $5.6 million versus seven firms with 10 disposals worth $4.4 million. The buy figures were up from the previous week's 13 companies, 22 purchases and $890,000. The sales, on the other hand, were sharply down from the previous week's 13 firms, 28 disposals and $16.3 million.\n\nWhile the buying by directors rose last week, buyback activity was flat with eight companies that posted 23 repurchases worth $8.6 million. The figures were consistent with the previous week's nine firms, 23 trades and $9.2 million. Buybacks were recorded in Nam Cheong and GP Industries and insider buys in MegaChem Limited, Sing Holdings, LantroVision Singapore and Libra Group. Meanwhile, there were rare director purchases in United Industrial Corporation and Hu An Cable Holdings last week.\n\nNam Cheong\n\nShipbuilder and vessel-chartering services provider Nam Cheong Limited picked up where it left off in May with 3.5 million shares purchased on June 16 at 38.5 cents each. The group previously bought two million shares on May 23 at 38 cents each. The repurchases since May are the company's first buybacks since the stock was listed in 1999. The trades were made on the back of the rise in the share price since April 2013 from 24 cents. The counter is also sharply up since December 2011 from 11 cents. Investors should note that CEO Leong Seng Keat purchased an initial 10 million shares (direct interest) from August to October 2013 at an average of 27 cents each. The shares bought represented 0.48 per cent of the issued capital. He also has deemed interest of 80.834 million shares or 3.84 per cent. The counter closed at 38.5 cents on Friday.\n\nGP Industries\n\nConsumer electronic products manufacturer GP Industries resumed buying back after the stock rebounded by 13 per cent from 44 cents on May 12 with 458,000 shares purchased from June 19 to 20 at an average of 50.5 cents each. The group previously acquired 240,000 shares from April 15 to 17 at an average of 48.1 cents each. Prior to the repurchases this quarter, the company acquired 11.15 million shares from January to October 2013 at 43 cents to 52 cents each or an average of 50.3 cents each and 10.9 million shares from August 2010 to January 2011 at 44 cents to 60 cents each or an average of 56.5 cents each. The counter closed at 51 cents on Friday.\n\nMegaChem\n\nExecutive chairman, managing director and co-founder Sidney Chew Choon Tee resumed buying shares of specialty chemical solutions provider MegaChem Limited at a higher price with 39,000 shares purchased on June 18 at 32 cents each. The trade increased his direct holdings to 45.961 million shares or 34.48 per cent of the issued capital. He also has deemed interest of 434,296 shares or 0.33 per cent. The acquisition was made after the stock rebounded by 10 per cent from 29 cents on May 28. He previously acquired 50,000 shares on May 5 at 30 cents each and 130,000 shares from March 4 to April 14 at 30 cents each. Prior to his purchases since March, Mr Chew acquired 317,000 shares from April to October 2013 at an average of 29.2 cents each and 35,000 shares from October to December 2012 at an average of 26.7 cents each. Prior to his purchases since 2012, the chairman acquired 415,000 shares from May 2009 to May 2011 at an average of 20.3 cents each and 1.22 million shares from May 2004 to October 2008 at an average of 20.8 cents each.\n\nAlso positive this quarter is executive director Tan Bock Chia with 3,000 shares purchased on May 28 at 29 cents each, which boosted his direct stake to 22.905 million shares or 17.18 per cent. He previously acquired 100,000 shares on April 10 at 28 cents each. Prior to his purchases this year, the director acquired 454,000 shares from June to July 2013 at an average of 29.3 cents each and 830,000 shares from November 2004 to September 2007 at an average of 19.3 cents each. The counter closed at 31.5 cents on Friday.\n\nSing Holdings\n\nCEO Lee Sze Hao picked up where he left off in residential, commercial and industrial properties developer and investor Sing Holdings in May with 130,000 shares purchased on June 18 at 38 cents each. The trade increased his direct holdings to 9.070 million shares or 2.26 per cent of the issued capital. He also has deemed interest of 139.074 million shares or 34.68 per cent. He previously acquired 1.02 million shares from May 19 to 29 at an average of 37.7 cents each. The purchases in the past two months were made on the back of the drop in the share price since June 2013 from 51 cents. Prior to his purchases since May, the CEO acquired 1.82 million shares in February 2013 at an average of 44.4 cents each, 2.04 million shares from March to June 2012 at an average of 33.1 cents each and 3.9 million shares from December 2009 to October 2011 at an average of 32.2 cents each.

The trade increased his direct holdings by 5 per cent to 20.168 million shares or 7.48 per cent of the issued capital. The acquisition was made after the stock rose by 66 per cent from his acquisition price in January. He previously acquired 266,000 shares from Jan 14 to 15 at 34 cents each. Prior to his trades this year, Mr Yeo acquired 915,000 shares in September 2013 at an average of 34.4 cents each, 13,000 shares in January 2013 at 26 cents each and 2.467 million shares from October to December 2012 at an average of 25 cents each.

The trades increased his direct holdings to 50.899 million shares or 51.04 per cent of the issued capital. He also has deemed interest of 8.320 million shares or 8.34 per cent. The acquisitions were made on the back of the 15 per cent drop in the share price since April 10 from 10 cents. He previously acquired 5.3 million shares from April 4 to 9 at an average of 8.5 cents each. The purchases since April are the chairman's first on-market trades since the stock was listed in November 2011. The chairman's acquisition price was sharply lower than the IPO price of 20.5 cents. Also positive this year is CFO Chua Siong Kiat with an initial 150,000 shares purchased on March 26 and a further 189,000 shares on April 4 at an average of 8.4 cents each. The shares bought represented 0.34 per cent of the issued capital. Those are his first on-market trades since he joined the Board in July 2013. The corporate shareholder sentiment is not entirely positive this year as Lee Kay Choon ceased to be a substantial shareholder on April 9 following the sale of one million shares at nine cents each, which lowered his direct stake by 17 per cent to 4.900 million shares or 4.91 per cent. The counter closed at 8.6 cents on Friday.\n\nUnited Industrial Corporation\n\nDirector Gwee Lian Kheng recorded his first on-market trades in property developer and information technology, development management and consultancy services provider United Industrial Corporation since his appointment to the board in 1999 with an initial 70,000 shares purchased from June 18 to 19 at an average of $3.36 each.

The stock closed at $3.24 on Friday.\n\nHu An Cable Holdings\n\nExecutive chairman & CEO Dai Zhi Xiang recorded his first on-market trade in wire and cables manufacturer Hu An Cable Holdings since September 2011 with 6.1 million shares purchased on June 19 at 8.2 cents each.

The acquisition was made on the back of the 38 per cent drop in the share price since January from 13.2 cents. The counter is also sharply down since January 2012 from 18.1 cents. He previously acquired 1.4 million shares in September 2011 at 25 cents each and 600,000 shares in March 2011 at 34 cents each.\n\nThe sentiment is not entirely positive this year as non-executive deputy chairman Yeung Wai Wing unloaded 16 million shares on Jan 3 at 13.1 cents each, which lowered his direct stake by 49 per cent to 16.507 million shares or 1.63 per cent.

Given that there was hardly any response here to the Fed's reassurances that rates will stay put for some time yet, it is more likely that the big money, having withdrawn from this region some 13 months ago, is still shunning emerging markets.\n\nIn the property sector, Hong Fok Corp's shares spiked up during the week. In response to an exchange query, the company said it could not explain why. The inevitable TWC was issued; despite a one-cent loss yesterday, Hong Fok's shares still rose 15 cents or 16 per cent over the week to $1.09.\n\nAnother firm queried was Poh Tiong Choon Logistics (PTC), whose shares jumped 3.5 cents to 76 cents yesterday, prompting an SGX query. The company had not replied by the close of trading; for the week, PTC's shares gained 13.5 cents or 21.6 per cent.\n\nIn the China/shipbuilding sectors, Yangzijang Shipbuilding's shares gained 6 cents to $1.12 over the week, thanks largely to its announcement that it has secured a very large shipbuilding contract from an Australian customer, an announcement that prompted most brokers to call a \"buy\" on the stock.\n\nAmong blue chips, DBS stood out - not because of its gains but because it fell 22 cents, or 1.3 per cent, over the week to $16.91. In yesterday's session when the STI dropped 10.22 points, DBS was the largest index loser, its 17- cent loss cutting 3.5 points off the index.\n\nOCBC Investment Research yesterday said that in a sustained high oil price environment, the \"winners\" are upstream oil and gas players and coal miners, and the \"losers\" are refiners, utilities (those without cost pass-through mechanisms) and fuel-intensive industries such as transport.\n\n\"We have an Underweight rating on the Air Transport sector, but are Overweight Land Transport. Companies with extensive operations in Iraq and neighbouring countries could also be at risk should the conflict spread,\" said the broker.\n\nIn its June 19 assessment of the latest FOMC meeting, Schroders said the Fed retains a dovish outlook on the economy, a message reinforced by Fed chair Janet Yellen in her post-meeting press conference where she expressed little concern about excess risk-taking in financial markets and market valuations, saying that the US equity market was within its historic range.\n\n\"The labour market is likely to tighten faster than the central bank expects. Unemployment is currently 6.3 per cent and in our view will be below 6 per cent by year-end,\" said Schroders.\n\n\"We expect the jobless rate to fall further in 2015, ending the year at 5.2 per cent, an outcome that would be consistent with rising wage pressure. We were surprised that there was little concern about the recent pick up in CPI inflation which will almost certainly to be followed by a rise in the PCE measure later this month.\n\n\"We continue to look for a more hawkish tone from the central bank, but clearly this will not come before the September meeting. In the meantime, with the promise to keep liquidity plentiful, Janet Yellen is following in the best tradition of her predecessors Greenspan and Bernanke by pumping markets higher.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Amid talk of an improving US economy and expectations of higher interest rates, forecasts at the start of the year were for a buoyant market for equity deals.\n\nBut the US economy's recovery remains at a plodding pace, and interest rates have remained low and attractive enough for debt to remain relatively cheap.\n\nInvestors are highly selective now, said Matthew Song, head of equity capital markets for HSBC in South-east Asia.\n\n\"The 'easy' yield sectors such as telcos, utilities and Reits have rallied since the global financial crisis and have now scaled back somewhat,\" Mr Song said.\n\n\"As central banks continue to keep rates artificially depressed, the hunt for yield has now moved on to other sectors, most notably to technology and oil in the first half of 2014. Investors will also focus on free cash flow, sustainable growth and capital structure management, in addition to yield.\"\n\nSingapore is still catching the eye of property and business trusts, said Mr Song. He noted the US$600 million Acordia Golf Trust, US$650 million L&T Business Trust, US$400 million Mytrah Energy Trust and the US$300 million I-Reit Global Management Trust as possible new listings.\n\nMr Song also expects the North Asian IPO market to outpace South-east Asia. In terms of industries, investors are likely to prefer information technology, financials and materials, where earnings have been below trend.\n\n\"With earnings growth and margins expansions likely to drive equities in 2014, investors will favour sectors where earnings have been depressed and therefore still have scope to rise,\" Mr Song said.\n\nOCBC's Ms Tay expects more IPOs in the second half, although issuers are also looking more at alternative sources of capital such as strategic investments or private deals.\n\n\"Investors could see more fund-raising activities from the oil and gas sectors given the positive outlook in these sectors, particularly among the exploration and production and offshore supply vessel segments,\" she said.\n\n\"Reits and business trusts are coming back to tap the market during this window, following the recent US Federal Reserve announcement that interest rates are expected to remain low till mid-next year.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By ANNABELLE YIP\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jun 22, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSHOULD a non-executive director (NED) of a listed company hold shares in that company? This question comes up regularly at Annual General Meetings (AGMs) and the answer is not straightforward.\n\nYes, they should:\n\nIn Singapore , Guideline 8.3 of the Code of Corporate Governance (Singapore Code) states that the Remuneration Committee should consider implementing schemes to encourage NEDs to hold shares so as to better align their interests with those of other shareholders.\n\nSimilarly, the Singapore Institute of Directors' (SID) Statement of Good Practice on Fees Payable to NEDs states that shares can be provided as an alternative to paying fees in cash, or as an additional grant to recognise particular achievements.\n\nShareholders themselves in the meantime, typically prefer that their directors or CEO should also own shares.\n\nNo, they should not:\n\nDirectors who do not own shares often attribute this to the difficulties associated with ownership. Strict insider trading rules and share dealing policies for example, mean that shares can be bought or sold only outside blackout periods and only when directors are not in possession of confidential materially price-sensitive information. On top of this, there are stringent disclosure requirements in place for each transaction.\n\nHowever, whilst these practical constraints do exist, they should not be a big hindrance. After all, one can reasonably argue that officers and directors of listed companies should not be trading in their shares on short-term considerations.\n\nIn fact, many NEDs take the view that they can buy, but should not sell, their company's shares while they are directors since selling is tantamount to signalling that the director has lost faith in the company or is aware of negative prospects not yet known by the market.\n\nTherein lies the rub though: some NEDs feel that they are unnecessarily restricted in their investment activities by this \"no sale of shares\" principle, and therefore prefer to avoid having any shareholding in the first place.\n\nThere is also a recent regulatory trend that cautions against going too far with schemes to force the issue of share ownership for the alignment of interests.\n\nBoth the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012 (UK Code) and the Australian ASX Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations 2014, for example, explicitly discourage the grant of share options or performance-based remuneration to NEDs.\n\nThe reason is that such grants or remuneration may lead to bias in the NEDs' decision-making and compromise objectivity.\n\nSID's Statement of Good Practice similarly cautions that including NEDs in share option plans, performance share plans, or other equity-related arrangements should only be done after a full consideration of the attendant risks of compromising directors' independence or judgment.\n\nThe UK Code goes a step further. If options are granted, shareholders' approval should be sought in advance, and any shares acquired by exercise of the options should be held until at least one year after the NED leaves the board.\n\nBack to basics\n\nPerhaps the distinction between not approving share options and equity-based remuneration for NEDs versus acceptability of share ownership is best understood with a closer examination of the role of these company officers.\n\nManagement is given share-based remuneration to incentivise them to drive the company's performance. In contrast, NEDs, particularly independent directors, play an oversight role. They are there to provide a check and balance on management. It could be argued that they should not be similarly incentivised with share-based remuneration. To do so would put NEDs at the same rank as executives who should be supervised and remunerated by NEDs.\n\nFurthermore with share options, there may not be a close alignment of interests with that of shareholders since option-holders typically do not pay for their options and suffer no real loss if the share price falls.\n\nOn the other hand, a shareholder has something tangible in hand whose value he will first want to protect, and also increase. Allocating a portion of directors' fees payable to NEDs in the form of, or for the acquisition of, shares means that the NEDs will, like other shareholders, have invested their own funds to become shareholders and have a genuine stake in the game.\n\nIt goes without saying that, if an NED has a large number of shares in his company, it can also impact his objectivity and judgment. This is why the Singapore Code specifies that holding 10 per cent of a company's shares would be relevant to the determination of the independence of an NED.\n\nPerhaps the short answer to the question we started with is this: NEDs should hold some shares to align themselves with the interests of other shareholders, but should not be holding so many shares, nor should their remuneration be tied to performance, such that their independence or objective judgment is affected.\n\nThe writer is a member of the Publications Committee of the Singapore Institute of Directors.\n\nFor more articles, go to\n\nbtd.sg/BMatters\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Those humans make mistakes about 20 per cent of the time, costing US$684 million a year, according to Ocean Audit Inc, which examines invoices for retailers such as Macy's Inc.\n\nTo cut this waste, customers and ship operators can now use digital platforms offered by Freightos, Amber Road Inc and Inttra Inc or by carriers including AP Moeller-Maersk A/S that make booking international freight as easy as reserving a hotel room or buying a sweater online.\n\n\"As an industry, I wouldn't pride ourselves on being at the forefront of technology,\" said Carsten Frank Olsen, a senior director responsible for Maersk Line's commercial business processes in Copenhagen. \"To the extent that we can automate processes, we can speed up the processing time and make more accurate booking confirmations and invoices.\"\n\nSolutions range from shipping companies developing their own software to independent companies trying to make booking freight more like buying a plane ticket.\n\nZvi Schreiber, a British-Israeli software entrepreneur, created Hong Kong-based Freightos in 2012. He said that he asked 15 companies in February how much it would cost to ship a couple of pallets of cookware, clothing or electronics from China to New York. Most of them took more than a week to reply.\n\nAbout 160 million containers filled with goods crossed oceans last year, 13 per cent of them bound for North America and 21 per cent for Europe, according to London-based Clarkson plc, the world's largest shipbroker.\n\nThe ocean shipping industry has not fully made the changeover because a single transaction usually involves multiple companies and jurisdictions with their own rules and procedures. Shipping lines prefer to keep privately negotiated rates secret, unlike airlines that publish fares.\n\nSpokesmen for the World Shipping Council and the Transpacific Stabilization Agreement, trade groups representing shipping companies, declined to comment.\n\nMaersk now takes about 87 per cent of its orders electronically, up from about 80 per cent for the past four years, according to Frank Olsen. About 40 per cent of bookings on Maersk's website are confirmed in five minutes to 19 minutes, and 90 per cent are finished within two hours, a \"significant improvement\" from a year or two ago, he said.\n\nIn most cases, shipping a box load of goods around the world remains a time-consuming and labour-intensive process. Orient Overseas International Ltd acknowledges online inquiries within 24 hours and then employees continue the booking process, according to Stephen Ng, the Hong Kong-based company's director of trades.\n\nExisting customers usually contact their account managers directly, Mr Ng said. As companies develop their own approaches, it may be difficult to establish a uniform system, he added.\n\nThe current system is too prone to error, according to Steve Ferreira, founder and president of Miami-based Ocean Audit. \"We need to be concerned about this because it's a huge drain on our economy,\" he said.\n\nOcean Audit reviews invoices to find mistakes in customers' favour, taking 50 per cent of the savings, Mr Ferreira said. Other start-ups seek to stop the discrepancies before they happen.\n\nThe biggest is Parsippany, New Jersey-based Inttra, whose network now processes 22 per cent of all containers shipped globally, according to Sandra Moran, chief marketing officer. The company began 13 years ago as a collaboration among the largest shipping companies, she said.\n\nWhile Inttra shows quotes from multiple carriers, Amber Road's service plugs in the terms of a company's negotiated contract, said Ty Bordner, vice-president of solutions consulting based in McLean, Virginia.\n\nThat allows users such as Honeywell International Inc and GlaxoSmithKline plc to enter the cargo, origin and destination, push a button, and see all the available rates and schedules according to their contract, he said. They can also book directly through the software. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Where to go? Where to stay? Here are some ideas.\n\nHelicopter flight in Ethiopia\n\nTHE African country may not be the first place that comes to mind but it looks set to be the place for high net worth travellers looking to outdo their chi-chi friends. Urbane Nomads offers a tour which includes seeing the country by helicopter, combining the underground churches of Lalibela, the incredible and other-worldly colours of the sulphur lakes in the Danakil, as well as the legendary tribes of the Omo Valley.\n\nSee Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe\n\nEMERGING from a decade-long lull in tourism, Zimbabwe is the fastest-growing long-haul tourism destination within Africa. While Victoria Falls is its most famous attraction, the country has other highlights such as Mana Pools, a Unesco World Heritage site, and the Great Zimbabwean ruins, which has some of the oldest and most impressive anthropological remains of ancient African origins.\n\nThe country also has the largest population of giraffes per square kilometre in Africa, a dense elephant population as well as rare game such as elands, roans and the sable antelopes. Safari travel consultancy firm Asia to Africa Safaris offers a variety of holidays at lodges to fit different budgets.\n\nGo gaming in Kenya\n\nEXPECT to see hotel guests of a different kind at the Giraffe Manor in Nairobi, where the titular animals are very likely to stroll right up to the dining room at breakfast time. Other attractions in this East African country include Samburu, for its dramatic semi-desert landscape, with blue hazy mountains in the distance, gently swaying Doum palm trees, and the even gentler trickling of the Ewaso Nyiro and Isiolo Rivers, making it one of Kenya's last true remaining wilderness areas. Of course, a trip to the game reserve is a must. The Maasai Mara Game Reserve, although not the largest game park in Kenya, is one of the most spectacular and most popular game reserves. Rich in game, the rolling grasslands and acacia savannah have frequently been captured on film. It is also where the movie, Out of Africa (1985), was filmed.\n\nBalti-style polo in Ladakh\n\nLUXURY travel agency Urbane Nomads is organising a tour to Ladakh in the Indian Himalayas where guests can not only watch a game of Balti-style polo but also take part alongside the locals. Balti-style polo is different from the more conventional polo in that one plays six-a-side and there are two 15-minute chukkas with a 10-minute break. The ponies used for the games are from Zanskar and while smaller in size, are acclimatised to the altitude and physical demands of the game. The polo tournament will be played from Sept 20 to 26.\n\nIce Fishing in Harbin\n\nWHEN it comes to winter holidays in Asia, Japan and Korea top the list. But for something different, how about Harbin? The north-east Chinese city is famed for its Arctic climate which means abundant natural ice and snow. Dynasty Travel is offering a tour which includes highlights such as steamboat in an ice palace, a visit to a snow village and ice fishing on the Song Hua River.\n\nChristmas Shopping\n\nCHRISTMAS markets started in Germany more than 500 years ago, when people gathered on cobblestone squares to buy the special tools and ingredients they needed to make the treats of the season. They kept warm with mulled wine, music and games, while they shopped and chatted with the local tradesmen. Today, though the light comes from twinkling electric bulbs rather than torches, bonhomie and fun still prevail. Insight Vacations offers a nine-day tour that takes visitors from Germany, and then into Austria to check out its Christmas markets. Priced at US$2,099 per person. To book, visit\n\nwww.insightvacations.com\n\n. For those who prefer cruising, Uniworld has an eight-day tour that takes visitors from Nuremberg to Frankfurt. The river cruise makes stops at the fabled Christmas markets of Christkindlesmarkt and Reiterlesmarkt.\n\nDining in a Volcano\n\nDining at the latest Michelin-starred restaurant is nothing when you can boast to friends about having a meal in a volcano. Iceland's Thrihnukagigur Volcano is the only place on earth where a huge volcanic magma chamber is accessible to humans. The dormant volcano last erupted over 4,000 years ago, so it is pretty safe. Guests transfer via helicopter to Thrihnukagigur Volcano while enjoying champagne on the way. Then it is a 120m descent to where the magma chamber will be open after-hours. Enjoy a private dinner with wine and a personal chef for an hour.\n\nSpending the night in an Airstream\n\nHEADING to California? How about spending the night in a 1957 Airstream vintage trailer that is perched on a hilltop with 360-degree views of the Pacific Ocean, Catalina, Santa Barbara Island and the Santa Monica Mountains. The restored trailer comes with a queen-sized bed, and a small dining area. It is charming, but the real attraction is being able to watch the sunset over Boney Mountain, after which the night sky becomes illuminated by millions of stars. You'll even catch glimpses of comets and satellites as they whizz past.\n\nStaying in a Castle\n\nWELL, not a real one. According to hotels.com, themed boutique hotels are getting popular with travellers who tire of the usual. Taipei's SATO Castle is a fantasy-themed hotel built like a castle with drawbridges and towers, offering 51 different rooms. Choose from the Swan Lake room or the Leaving Las Vegas room.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 20, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nAS an interior designer, Elizabeth Acland shapes the way her clients live. \"They come with a brief of how they want their home to look, and I make it a reality,\" says Ms Acland,\n\nco-founder of E & A Interiors. But when it came to her own home, she was almost at a loss. \"It was more difficult. I had so many ideas, I had access to everything you need to do up a home - it was much tougher to pick what I wanted.\" In the end, she opted for an eclectic look for the two-storey conservation home in Emerald Hill, where she lives with her fund manager fiance Timothy Hay. \"The look is a mix of old and new, which is befitting of the house itself,\" she says. \"Its location is right smack in the middle of Orchard Road, and yet the home retains its old charm.\"\n\nThe couple moved to Singapore last year, when Mr Hay found a job here. Like most expatriate couples, they went house-hunting, viewing apartments and shophouses. \"We visited a friend who stayed in a shophouse, and fell in love with the idea of doing the same. So we picked this over living in an apartment,\" says Ms Acland. \"But had we moved into an apartment, the look of it would definitely be more modern.\" Their conservation home had been left empty for a while, but the couple saw the potential in it. \"I loved the high ceiling, which makes the house feel cooler.\"\n\nThe home comes with its original ornate pintu pagar (wooden half doors), elaborate plaster work and wood carvings which combine to create an architectural hybrid that is also referred to as Chinese Baroque. Near the dining area is a built-in wall cabinet which is a traditional feature of Hokkien shophouses. \"It is the perfect place to store our glassware,\" says Ms Acland.\n\nThis is the first time the couple are living together, and the first family home that Ms Acland is decorating. \"Thankfully, Tim and I have similar tastes,\" she quips.\n\nMs Acland started her interior design career in London's Colefax and Fowler, the most established design house in London where she learnt the fundamentals of fabric and design. She then joined leading interior design firm Veere Grenney Associates, and worked on projects in New York, The Hamptons, Jackson Hole, Mustique, London and Sweden.\n\nShe met her business partner Chloe Elkerton in Singapore, and the duo decided to start E & A Interiors. \"We offer the full spectrum of interior design, from custom-making one armchair for a client to full renovation projects. The studio has our own experienced in-house furniture-makers and we customise most items here in Singapore,\" says Ms Acland.\n\nBut what makes them stand out from other firms is E & A's exclusive and varied library of unique fabrics, rugs and wallpapers. The studio specialises in representing small boutique suppliers producing artisanal fabrics and wallpapers from England, France, Belgium and North America. Many of the fabrics are hand-woven and hand-printed. The use of fabrics can be clearly seen on the sofas, armchairs and cushions in Ms Acland's sitting room. \"Fabrics are a great way to brighten up the look of the home, since we are renting this place, and didn't want to spend on wallpaper,\" she says. \"You could use fabric as upholstery, as curtains, or even wrapping them on lampshades.\" Ms Acland has also wrapped the bedhead in her favourite Le Manach fabric.\n\n\"How you use the fabric will depend on its weight, such as the heavier ones for upholstery,\" she advises. \"Textures on the fabric also add interest.\"\n\nThe studio also specialises in lighting and carries high-end English lighting brand, Vaughan Designs, which Ms Acland also uses in her own home. Many of the pieces have a rather vintage look to them, which complements the home's architecture.\n\nThe couple spend the most time in the sitting room. Natural light fills the space which makes it ideal for relaxing and reading.\n\nJust behind the sitting room is the study, which Ms Acland used more often when the studio was based in her home. E & A Interiors is now at Kim Yam Road. Here in the study, Ms Acland has adorned the wall with portraits of her late grandmother, Myrtle Acland, one of the leading models of the late 1940s and early 1950s - her face was used to promote Lux soap. Little renovation was done by the landlord to the home, save for the kitchen, which now has an open feel with an adjoining garden at the back. \"Tim's the one with green fingers,\" says Ms Acland.\n\nMost of the furniture was either brought over by the couple from the UK, or bought locally from antique and second-hand stores such as Aphorism and Hock Siong respectively. They also brought with them their personal art collection, which again, \"are a mix of antique paintings and modern ones\", says Ms Acland.\n\nTwo of her favourite pieces are in the sitting room, one of which is a piece in different shades of blue by Singapore-based British painter Leo Poloniecki. Ms Acland adds that Poloniecki painted a whole series for the E & A studio and they have 10 other pieces here in various colours. Her other favourite is a smaller cubist painting, \"it could be a Joseph Csaky from the 1920s, but I don't know for sure\".\n\nDespite moving in for just over a year, Ms Acland, like most other interior designers, says that her home is still a work in progress. The couple plan to live in this home for a few more years, but Ms Acland doesn't mind moving house sooner. \"I enjoy moving. It is an excuse to do more stuff,\" she says.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\n@TaySuanChiangBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Kong Siang's shareholders are David Lee Eng Thong, Lee Eng Khian, Victor Lee Eng Chye and Lee Siu Huang.\n\nMr Goi is the executive chairman of GSH Corporation, Tee Yih Jia Group and Yangzhou Junhe Real Estate Group.\n\nThe money raised will be used as working capital to fund the growth and expansion of the group's business and to increase its capacity for any acquisitions in the future.\n\nThe issue price of $0.1633 a share represents a discount of about 10 per cent to the weighted average price of $0.1814 per share for trades done on Wednesday up to the time the placement agreements were signed.\n\nSunningdale is a regional integrated precision plastic component supplier providing mould manufacturing, injection moulding, spray painting and assembly services, with operations in Singapore and China.\n\nFor the fiscal first quarter ended March 31, the group posted net profit of $8.45 million, up from $2.31 million a year earlier. The boost came from a \"net profit on disposal of non-current assets held for sale amounting to $5.2 million\". Revenue for the three months dipped 4 per cent to $105.7 million.\n\nSunningdale shares, which resumed trading yesterday following release of the share subscription announcement, closed trading at 18.1 cents, down 0.4 cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

One produces travel coaches and the other is in the electronics components manufacturing industry.\n\nDBS Bank said that via its unit, DBS Bank (China), it has helped a customer from South- east Asia based in the SIP to get a RMB loan under the new SIP cross-border RMB transactions initiative.\n\nDBS is the only Singapore- headquartered bank to pilot this initiative, the bank said.\n\nAs for HSBC Singapore, its chief executive Guy Harvey-Samuel said: \"This is the latest in a series of RMB initiatives which HSBC has been pleased to be involved with in our efforts to grow our range of RMB products and services.\"\n\nLast week, the Nanjing branch of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), China's central bank, issued a directive to allow banks in Singapore to provide RMB-denominated loans to companies located in the SIP, without limiting the annual foreign debt quota of the banks.\n\nIn addition, there is an expansion in the usage of the loans, allowing companies to entrust loans to their subsidiaries.\n\n\"Companies in the SIP. . . are now able to tap into our pool of offshore RMB liquidity in Singapore, and benefit from the greater flexibility this capability offers them in managing their cash positions,\" said Mr Harvey-Samuel.\n\n\"It is evident that recent measures to promote use of the RMB internationally are bearing fruit and will encourage greater use of the currency through Singapore,\" he said.\n\nAs China steps up the pace of freeing up its currency, banks are making sure they are ready to seize the opportunities offered.\n\n\"This new initiative enables corporate clients in SIP to secure foreign financing at a lower cost as well as take advantage of tailor-made innovative financing products via a more well-established and diversified product structure from Standard Chartered Singapore,\" said the bank.\n\nDBS China has reached agreements with a couple of companies based in the SIP to obtain cross-border RMB loans. The bank's Singapore headquarters is actively working with companies in the industrial township to prepare for RMB bonds issuance in Singapore.\n\nYear to date, DBS has handled 18 offshore RMB bond deals worth 21.65 billion yuan.\n\n\"DBS is one of the first movers in the cross-border RMB business and provides offshore RMB products and services in Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, with seamless connectivity across the three markets, to help clients capture opportunities in a timely manner and to further support the development of RMB internationalisation,\" said Neil Ge, DBS Bank (China) chief executive.\n\nVenky Vishwanthan, Deutsche Bank head of capital markets and treasury solutions, Asia, said the German-owned bank has completed 2.97 billion yuan worth of loans from its Singapore branch to Chinese companies via the PBOC RMB pilot schemes to date.\n\n\"These loans represent the opening of a new pool of liquidity for Chinese corporates looking for financing from global financial markets, and we are actively working with our clients to grow this channel,\" he said.\n\n\"We are witnessing an acceleration in the pace of reform in China and are expecting more breakthroughs ahead,\" said Mr Vishwanthan.\n\nThis week PBOC named yuan clearing banks for London and Frankfurt as it further promotes the internationalisation of the country's currency.\n\nOn Thursday, another state body said China will start direct trade between its yuan currency and Britain's pound.\n\nSterling and RMB will be directly swapped from June 19 without using the US dollar as an intermediary, the China Foreign Exchange Trade System said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Some shares will also be offered to staff.\n\nVietnam is planning more than 430 IPOs for state-run companies this year and in 2015, but only a few - including Vietnam Airlines, mobile network operator MobiFone and garment firm Vinatex - are expected to catch the eye of foreign investors.\n\nThe airline's IPO has faced bureaucratic delays for several years and comes as competition from ambitious low-cost carrier VietJet Air heats up. Its rival agreed last year to buy US$9 billion worth of planes from Airbus Group NV over the next decade and plans to list in two years, likely outside Vietnam.\n\nThe valuation for Vietnam Airlines implied by the IPO is, however, less than one of US$2.7 billion given by financial advisers last month.\n\nThe source working on the IPO said that the government made an exception and allowed the airline to use its current book value as the basis for the IPO, as the one suggested by advisers would have resulted in increased depreciation expenses in the future. The source declined to be identified as the matter is still a proposal.\n\nVietnam Airlines plans to offer as many as 49 million shares, equivalent to up to 3.5 per cent of the company, at a price of 22,300 dong (S$1.31) per share, media reported.

Beijing says four Chinese citizens died.\n\nThe dispute is only the latest between China and its South-east Asian neighbours, which challenge Beijing's expansive claims to the South China Sea.\n\nThe Philippines on Thursday asked a UN tribunal to speed up its ruling on whether China's claims in the region are in violation of international maritime law. Beijing has resolutely refused to participate in the proceedings.\n\nBeijing has also been accused of undertaking land reclamation projects in disputed areas, further stoking tensions.

For The Lokal's co-founder Benjamin Lee, the answer is too many. His mission at his six-day-old joint, thus, is to marry good coffee with dishes that hold their own too.\n\n\"You already see that happening in cities such as Melbourne and London, where great cafes with great ambience are serving up equally great food,\" observes the Sydney native. His popular sandwich joint Sarnies in Telok Ayer roasts its own mostly single-origin coffee beans, which are also brewed at his sophomore outlet.\n\nSlurp down your joe with thoughtfully crafted dishes that vary throughout the day. Whether you want to start with a superfoods-packed breakfast of granola with goji berries and chia seeds ($14), go full-on with a breakfast burger of pork belly with omelette and chilli jam ($23), or ease into light salads, cold platters and wholesome sandwiches such as a roast chicken panini ($15) or roast beef on rye ($17) for lunch - there's plenty for the picking. Dinner menus are still being finalised and will be introduced in a month's time.\n\nWhile three-year-old Sarnies is a cosy, well-worn den with an everyone-knows-your-name air of bonhomie, The Lokal with its art deco floor tiles and sky blue interior accents is an uplifting space that has natural light streaming in through its open bar and kitchen counters. The \"girly touch\", laughs Mr Lee, comes from taking on board new business partner, Louise Tong-Davies, who used to help out regularly at Sarnies and also runs supperclub Brunch & Co.\n\nTheir third partner is Australian head chef Darren Farr, who was one of the founding chefs of Tetsuya's in Sydney and the former kitchen honcho at Culina. He prides himself on creating everything on the menu from scratch at The Lokal, from its cherry wood-smoked mackerel to its home-churned butter and ricotta cheese, down to its ketchup made from a relish of fermented tomato with bourbon.\n\nAs the 55-seater sits within a tenanted ground floor corner of the new Goethe Institute at the junction of Neil Road and Bukit Pasoh Road, the menu has subtle German accents seen in a side of house-pickled sauerkraut or a belly-filling veal schnitzel burger (though embellished, in typical Aussie fashion, with a slice of grilled pineapple in between).\n\nBesides The Lokal, Mr Lee last month launched his first overseas venture Jump Cafe within a trampoline park in Kuala Lumpur, and plans to open a second outlet in the Malaysian capital followed by a third outlet in Singapore's CBD later this year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Perhaps a bit too much for Mini's comfort.\n\nAlmost 80 per cent of Mini owners in China are women, the highest level among any car brand, JD Power & Associates estimates. Now, the company is taking pains to give its cars more masculine connotations. Hence the pool table in the Shanghai showroom, and the all-Mini road trip the company recently organised to Tibet.\n\n\"You don't want to tip into being a girlie car,\" Sean Green, head of Mini's China business, said in Beijing last week. \"Not only do you alienate the men, you actually alienate a lot of women, because a lot of women won't want to buy a feminine brand.\"\n\nThe strategy helps show the variety of ways carmakers are seeking to carve out their place in the world's biggest car market, with more than 100 nameplates targeting an estimated one billion drivers within a decade. China is the fourth-largest market for Mini after the US, the UK and Germany, and vies globally with Daimler's Smart brand, Fiat's 500 and Volkswagen's New Beetle for buyers of small urban cars.\n\nDeliveries of the Mini, owned by Bayerische Motoren Werke, have risen 18 per cent in China in the first five months of the year, outpacing the 11 per cent growth in the overall passenger-vehicle market, according to company and auto association data. Mini sold 11,440 units in China in the period, outselling both the Smart and Fiat 500.\n\nThat's in spite of the fact that the Mini starts at 205,000 yuan (S$41,000) in China, more than an Audi A3.\n\nThe Mini has emerged as a status symbol among many Chinese women who like its looks and see its BMW connection as conferring luxury, according to Munling Cheong, market research director at Shanghai-based Labbrand Enterprise Management Consulting.\n\n\"It's very cute. It appeals to women who are a bit playful, because the brand itself is playful,\" said Ms Cheong, whose employer has advised Audi on how to name their cars in China.\n\nTo attract male buyers, Mini is being \"overtly masculine in some of the communication style,\" said Mr Green, who was previously head of sales and marketing for the brand in 26 European markets. He cited the introduction of the John Cooper Works high-performance version in China in June 2013. The line is named after an engineer who developed a rally version of the Mini in the 1960s, featuring lowered sports suspension and 18-inch alloy wheels.\n\n\"You won't see a Hello Kitty Mini,\" Mr Green said of the brand's product strategy.\n\nTo bolster its image for dependability, Mini made a documentary about a convoy of Mini cars traversing some of China's most rugged and remote terrain through Tibet to the foot of Mount Everest.\n\nChen Chunguang, a Beijing resident, is among the converts. Mr Chen, who owns a BMW X6 SUV and Mercedes-Benz S350 sedan, said that he now prefers to drive his wife's four-door Mini Countryman for his commute. \"I didn't intend to buy a Mini,\" said Mr Chen, 32, who nicknames his car \"Little Blue\". \"After I test drove one, I changed my mind within half an hour. The handling was very good and there was a lot of power.\"\n\nAs part of its expansion plans, Mini will open 10 to 15 dealership a year in China, adding to the 97 it currently has, according to Mr Green. The company isn't looking at producing the Mini in the country for now, he said, even though it would allow it to avoid import duties of about 25 per cent.\n\nTo be sure, Mini isn't about to give up its prized niche among high-income women, with 53 per cent of its owners in China earning more than 20,000 yuan a month, compared with the industry average of 19 per cent, according to Songlin Mei, JD Power China vice-president and managing director.\n\nChina has 17 million college-educated women between 25 and 34 years of age, of whom at least 4.5 million are unmarried, according to Wang Feng, a sociology professor who teaches at Shanghai's Fudan University and the University of California, Irvine. \"It's a very powerful consumer group and getting larger,\" Prof Wang said.\n\nMini zagged where others zigged at this year's car show in Beijing. Most carmakers at the event continued their reliance on female models, many scantily clad, to attract visitors to their booths. At the Mini booth, the models included men in colourful T-shirts and dark jeans.\n\n\"It's one of the challenges you have, whenever you have a small car, you tend to move towards the female buyers,\" Mr Green said. \"Is it a problem for Mini? No, because we're still very successful. We welcome female buyers as we do male buyers.\" Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/crossover-star", "site_title": "Crossover star", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nCrossover star\n\nThe GLA250 is a different type of Mercedes-Benz with refreshing styling and an engaging drive. By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 20, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nFOR something that is supposed to be in the compact SUV segment, the Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class doesn't really look much like a sport-utility vehicle. For one thing, this crossover with the three-pointed star isn't that tall and looks more like a high-riding hatchback.\n\nBut in terms of styling, the GLA-Class is striking. Sharp lines, sculpted contours and large wheel arches give it an aggressive stance. This is what the A-Class would be if it were bigger and more macho (both share the same platform). But look past the visual drama to appreciate the GLA's harmonious proportions. It is so well-balanced that its big 19-inch wheels do not look outsized. It may be a big hatch but it doesn't look it.\n\nThere are three engine options for the GLA-Class - the GLA200 with a 1.6-litre turbocharged petrol engine and the GLA200 CDI with a 2.2-litre turbodiesel - both front-wheel-drive - and the all-wheel-drive GLA250.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLA250 4Matic has a 2.0-litre turbocharged engine mated to a 7G-DCT dual clutch transmission. This direct injection unit may not sound it when heard from outside, but from the inside, it is so smooth and quiet it hardly feels like a four-cylinder power plant.\n\nThe GLA250 mainly operates in front-wheel-drive mode but with 4Matic variable all-wheel-drive capability, it can send up to 50 per cent of the torque to the rear wheels when needed. 4Matic also comes with DSR Downhill Speed Regulation - to automatically control downhill descent with the engine, transmission and brakes - and an off-road transmission mode, which modifies the throttle mapping and shift points when driving on loose surfaces.\n\nBut perhaps the most interesting aspect of the GLA250 is the way it drives. Unlike older Mercs, or even the CLA-Class, the accelerator is responsive. It is not overtly sensitive, but it is definitely very different from the delayed pedal action that most Mercs display.\n\nIt also handles well. Take a sweeping corner and the GLA250 remains composed while still offering a high level of ride comfort. This is due to the ESP Dynamic Cornering Assist feature. By working with the ESP Electronic Stability Program to selectively brake individual wheels during cornering, directional stability is enhanced and steering effort reduced. The result is that the GLA250 feels refreshingly agile for a Mercedes.\n\nAt 4.4 metres in length with a 2,699 mm wheelbase, the GLA250 is not a small hatch. The two front seats are representative of these dimensions but its rear bench is more snug. Head and legroom are adequate but a third occupant may find it tight, especially with the wide transmission tunnel.\n\nThere are no rear air vents either, as Mercedes believes the three round centre vents on the centre console provide sufficient ventilation to the back of the car. Neither is climate control available.\n\nOther than that, however, the GLA250's interior is modern and well-made, with front sports seats, contrast stitching, a flat-bottomed steering wheel and signature one-piece dashboard trim.\n\nThe cabin is also well-insulated from noise and vibration with the overall refinement high for a car in its class.\n\nIt seems Mercedes-Benz's latest line of compact front-wheel-drive models just keeps getting better and better.\n\nsamuelee@sph.com.sg\n\nSPECS\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLA250 4Matic\n\nEngine\n\n1,991cc turbocharged\n\nGearbox\n\n7-speed dual clutch transmission\n\nMax power\n\n211 hp @ 5,500 rpm\n\nMax torque\n\n350 Nm @ 1,200-4,000 rpm\n\n0-100 kmh\n\n7.1 secs\n\nTop speed\n\n230 kmh\n\nCO2 emissions\n\n154 g/km\n\nAverage OMV\n\n$34,000\n\nPrice\n\n$199,888 (with COE)\n\nDistributor\n\nCycle & Carriage\n\nTel\n\n6298 1818\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Ipco shares fell 8 per cent to 1.1 cents.\n\nEarlier this month, another connected firm, Innopac Holdings, said it made a loss of $63 million for the financial year 2013, much higher than the preliminary unaudited figures of a $14 million loss.\n\nThe higher losses were attributed to an additional provision of $34 million for a derivative receivable transaction and reclassification of income statement items.\n\nLionGold had also last month issued a warning before it announced that it made a much wider loss of $143 million for fiscal year ended March 2014 from $8 million a year ago.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The community, too, must support one another,\" said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday at a swearing-in ceremony for the five mayors who serve as the chairmen of the CDCs.\n\nThree of them - Teo Ho Pin, Teo Ser Luck and Mohamad Maliki Osman - were re-appointed for another three-year term until May 2017. The other two, Low Yen Ling and Denise Phua, are mayors for the first time.\n\nCDCs were first established in 1997 as part of the process to build a tightly-knit, compassionate and self-reliant community.\n\nIn his speech at the People's Association (PA) Headquarters, Mr Lee called on these councils to do more to involve the private sector, be it by championing corporate social responsibility, or encouraging companies to adopt local causes or partner a voluntary welfare organisation.\n\n\"(The CDCs should) promote volunteerism and a spirit of giving back, especially among those who have done well,\" he added.\n\nMr Teo Ser Luck, who is also Minister of State for Trade and Industry, said it was important for CDCs to work with businesses in order to expand their outreach and be able to help more people.\n\n\"CDCs must be able to influence and educate the business sector about the social aspect (of working together),\" he told reporters after the event.\n\n\"So it's all about working with different business organisations on the ground, the merchants' associations, federations, and so on. I think that if we can partner them, organisation to organisation, the outreach will be much wider,\" said Mr Teo.\n\nDr Maliki, meanwhile, said he hoped that companies would go beyond just having a CSR day by involving their employees on a larger scale and to take part in more sustainable programmes together.\n\n\"(We want) to connect them with local communities, work with the elderly, the low-income children, and harness (the companies') own assets,\" he said.\n\nOn the whole, PM Lee said that the CDCs' mission of \"assisting the needy, bonding the community, and connecting the community\" was still relevant even in today's changing environment.\n\nThe CDCs have an important role in helping to build up the government's 20 social service offices (SSOs), which are being set up across the island to administer social assistance to needy residents in HDB estates.\n\nThe 20 offices will help Singaporeans navigate through the \"kueh lapis\" of government assistance programmes, layer by layer, he said.\n\n\"Use your knowledge and networks to help these SSOs start off on the right foot, and strike the right balance between administrative efficiency and personal touch,\" said Mr Lee in his message to the mayors and the CDCs. \"The SSOs' success is also your success.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Till this week, it would have been upmarket Indian food, but not anymore.\n\nSaha, which opens today, is the first Singapore outpost for celebrated Indian chef Abhijit Saha, who owns the restaurants Caperberry and Fava in Bangalore and is often lauded as the \"Gordon Ramsay\" of India.\n\nChef Saha is known for his modernist take on regional Indian cuisine, so expect him to take creative licence with traditional dishes. New Age Paneer Mattar, for example, sees the familiar cottage cheese with green peas reinterpreted as quenelles of chena (a kind of yam) and pea sprouts. The mundane sounding Tasting of Mushroom, on the other hand, is a soup turned into a frothy cappucino scented with masala and dusted with frozen mushroom parfait powder.\n\nThe 40-seater takes over the second floor private dining room above Russian restaurant, Buyan. Its Russian and Indian owners - Ravi Viswanathan and his wife Julia Sherstyuk - had been looking to revamp the three-year-old space earlier this year. Buyan itself closed in January for renovation works and re-opened in March.\n\nWhile India-based Mr Saha will fly in regularly to preside over the menus as consulting chef, resident sous chef Preetam Singh Sodi will helm the day-to-day operations. Mr Sodi has eight years of experience working in the kitchens of 5-star hotels such as the Shangri-La Hotel in Mumbai, The Leela Palace in Chennai and The Oberoi Amarvilas in Agra.\n\nBesides a main dining room decked out in classic-contemporary decor and an elegant solid wood table for 12, Saha also features a 22-seat al fresco terrace bar. Find a perch there to knock back mod-Indian cocktails such as mango rosemary martinis and curry-tinis along with South Asian-inspired tapas such as baked samosas with chutney foam or khasta roti tacos with chickpeas and avocado salsa, all while taking in views of Duxton Hill's idyllic greenery.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Mr Tee was previously head chef of now-closed modernist restaurant Keystone while Mr Yip is a fellow stagiaire from his 2011 stint at two Michelin-starred Pastorale in Belgium.\n\nPrior to opening, Restaurant Andre and Guy Savoy-trained Mr Tee clocked in a further six months in the kitchen of Le Bistrot Du Sommelier.\n\nThe duck rillette served with bread and baby gherkins ($8) is a throwback to the latter restaurant's highly popular charcuterie offerings, while the braised pork belly served with an onsen egg and potato foam is a take on Keystone's $34 kurobuta pork belly, except that the $15 coffeeshop version is made with local pork instead. Though now in more modest settings, there are still some things he won't compromise on, such as using only French butter, milk and cream in his cooking, says Mr Tee. Or sous-vide cooking his chicken breasts, done both to keep the usually dry meat extra juicy as well as to raise awareness of the increasingly popular cooking technique among regular dining folk. On the blueprint is a gourmet French-inspired burger with gruyere cheese fondue and onion confit in a homemade brioche bun. We can't wait.\n\nMian\n\n12pm-10pm (Tue-Sun)\n\nA permanent homebase for two-year-old food truck, The Travelling Cow, Mian - as its name suggests - takes all the popular favourites from the truck and serves them in larger, dine-in portions that you can now eat with proper utensils.\n\nThe Cow's classic ramen burger comes with four Asian fillings at Mian - beef bulgolgi, spicy barbecue chicken, chicken and crab salad (all $12) - along with regularly-rotated weekly specials such as a wagyu burger patty served on a bed of penne ($16) and newfangled creations such as the cheesy ramen bites ($6), a trio of deep-fried ramen-crusted dumpling filled with nutty emmental cheese.\n\nPastas (all $12, inclusive of soup) also vary in flavours from a piquant seafood laksa linguine to the lighter sesame cold soba with portobello mushroom and watercress.\n\nWith the week-old brick and mortar up and running, the food truck will be free to serve as a platform for more innovative menus and collaborations, says its founder Karen Cheng, who tied up with Japanese restaurant Hashida for a pop-up along Scotts Road earlier this year. Watch this space for more.\n\nTwo Wings\n\nTel 9667-0368\n\n12-3pm, 6-11pm (Tue-Sun)\n\nIts decidedly modern menu may look like a local take on Kentucky Fried Chicken, but Two Wings is really Jeremy Loh and Samantha Lim's attempt to revive a 40-year-old recipe from Mr Loh's granduncle, who sold fried chicken rice sets in a Toa Payoh Lorong 5 hawker centre until he retired seven years ago. Incidentally, Mr Loh claims, the recipe is also the same one his granduncle's brother-in-law used to start Carona Chicken, now a chain with 10 outlets in food courts islandwide and three in Indonesia.\n\nMr Loh trained for six months under his granduncle before he and Ms Lim opened Two Wings in May. The couple sells around 150 wings on weekdays and up to 300 on weekends.\n\nThe first thing that strikes you about his wings is that they are much larger than the 80g to 90g wings you usually get. That's because Two Wings specifically uses Brazilian-bred chickens that yield mainly 100g to 120g wings, says Mr Loh, coyly declining to reveal what goes into the batter for its slightly bitter, though shatteringly crisp chicken skin that he claims can stay that way for up to four hours after frying.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Cheah Ui-Hoon\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 20, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nLET'S face it. We all know of someone who's better-looking than we are and whom we suspect \"got the job\" or the promotion because of their looks. Countless surveys have been done to show that good-looking people go farther in life and get more handouts.\n\nRecently, a Labour Day survey in Singapore showed that the majority of respondents - 500 men and women aged between 30-60 years were surveyed - believed that good looks gave an advantage in work.\n\nAnd which body part counted the most? It seemed that respondents ranked \"the whole face\" and \"eyes\" as most important when it comes to good looks, and would consider treatment of the eyes if they had to or could do something about it. The survey was carried out by Allergan, the purveyor of Botox.\n\nBut it is a fact that the eyes are the central and the most expressive feature of the face. Ageing around the eyes starts as early as the 20s, when fine lines start to develop between the eyebrows (frown lines) and around the outer corner of the eyes (crow's feet).\n\nThese faint lines continue to deepen in the 30s and beyond, which can give a person a tired, worried or angry appearance. All of which can be minimised with Botox. No wonder then that Botox has been gaining so much ground in the last two decades as the go-to toxin for controlling one's appearance.\n\n\"By now, the acceptance level for Botox is very high - as, according to a local survey, a lot of people feel that to advance in work they need to look good; and one way to do that is with Botox and fillers. Perception has changed over the years. It's no longer taboo,\" says David Loh, vice-president of the Society of Aesthetic Medicine in Singapore.\n\nOriginally, Botox was used to limit uncontrolled blinking and misaligned eyes but once its age-defying cosmetic effect was discovered, that's what has made its reputation and Allergan's profits.\n\nRegardless of its wide acceptance and popularity today, however, aesthetic doctors note that there are still \"myths\" and misconceptions about it.\n\nHere are some common questions:\n\nDr Loh points out that you can't biologically get addicted, but it's certainly easy to get used to looking younger. \"The reality is that results are so good that people find it hard to wean themselves off Botox,\" says Dr Loh.\n\nThe \"natural\" look is in, versus the \"frozen\" look, notes Dr Loh. And since trained aesthetic doctors have been using Botox for more than a decade, skills have also improved. The most useful place to be Botox-ed is the area between the eyebrows.\n\n\"Once you ease it out a person will look less annoyed, upset, and unfriendly,\" says Dr Loh. The lines between the forehead occur because of strong muscle and loss of skin elasticity. \"So muscles aren't necessarily at rest when you are, and the basal muscle tone is enough to crease the skin.\"\n\nBotox can selectively relax the muscles between the eyebrows, and it does it quite accurately, explains Dr Loh.\n\nHow does the frozen look come about, then? \"It's actually quite hard to achieve as you need a lot of Botox. Naturally, it's been exaggerated by certain personalities or caricatured in media, but really it's not so easy to achieve the frozen forehead look,\" he notes. In the end, it's still the experienced physician who will best be able to determine your look, he adds.\n\nToday, it's a trend to keep some of the crow's feet at the eyes as well, as those in their 40s think they'll look \"fake\" without the crow's feet.\n\nThis is entirely technique and dosage dependent, points out Sylvia Ramirez of Cutis Medical Laser Clinic. \"This can be avoided with the use of lower doses of Botox especially if you are new to the treatment. The key to a good Botox treatment is 'no one should know'. A good Botox treatment should result in a 'refreshed' or 'relaxed' look,\" she adds.\n\nDr Ramirez says that topical creams can \"appear\" to reduce the lines by temporarily \"filling\" in the wrinkles but these will never be as effective as Botox which reduces the formation of the expression lines by reducing muscle contraction. \"Patients are often surprised that a Botox treatment can actually be less expensive than some of the topical creams in the market.\"\n\nDr Ramirez explains that if done properly, Botox has preventive effects. \"If a person does regular Botox treatments for some time, the muscles are retrained from disuse and, for a time, that individual will notice reversal of many of the lines such as those that give a person a \"negative\" impression ('Angry 11's' or frown lines).\"\n\nDr Ramirez advises anyone new to Botox to ask the doctor to start with low doses, and most importantly, doctors with a long track record of injecting Botox would consistently provide great results even with small amounts of Botox.\n\nBut in her experience, the most common result that needs correction or \"touch up\" is the \"Spock\" or \"Mephisto\" look where there is exaggerated peaking of the eyebrows due to inadequate treatment in the lateral aspect of the forehead. \"This is readily corrected with the addition of a very low dose of Botox to correct the sharp peaking of the eyebrow.\"\n\nA true complication may occur when improper injection of Botox results in a droopy eyelid, explains Dr Ramirez. \"Which is why it's important to go to an experienced Botox injector.\"\n\nuihoon@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Other sponsors and partners include Boustead Singapore, Centurion, Cerebos, ACE Medical, Ambient Lounge, Ayuthaya Spa, Callaway, Fitness First Singapore, Red Monster, Big Peat, De Burg, Erdinger, The Datai Langkawi, The Els Club and SunMoon Foods, who will be providing SunMoon Fruit Cups and Fruit Crisps in the first and final rounds.\n\nAudi Singapore is returning as the Presenting Sponsor for the fourth year and the hole-in-one sponsor for the fifth year running. This year, their hole-in-one prize is the Audi S3 sedan, which is the latest addition to the Audi S car family. It boasts a powerful two-litre engine, Audi's signature quattro all-wheel drive, and slick-shifting six-speed S tronic transmission. It gets from 0-100 kmh in five seconds and is limited to a top speed of 250kmh. The car is the flagship of the highly successful Audi A3 range with premium features that include the latest generation of the acclaimed Audi Multi Media Interface (MMI) touch, Fine Nappa leather upholstery, B&O premium sound system and more. The new Audi S3 sedan will be on offer as the hole-in-one prize for each of the six games in the BT Corporate Golf League.\n\nWGC Singapore is also returning for the fifth year as a hole-in-one sponsor. The prize is a six-day/five-night stay for two golfers at the magnificent Terre Blanche Hotel Spa Golf Resort in Cannes, France. This includes accommodation for five nights in a deluxe suite; four rounds of golf at their 36-hole European Tour Championship Course with twin-share buggy, daily breakfast, and return private transfer from Nice Airport to Terre Blanche Resort. If there is no winner during the League's six rounds, the hole-in-one prize will be given away during the final round's dinner lucky draw.\n\n\"We are returning because the BT Corporate Golf League and WGC mottos are the same - to promote friendship and business. There is a click between us and on top of that it's our 20th anniversary this year,\" explains WGC Singapore's Sazali Bava, adding: \"The BT Corporate Golf League is an exclusive corporate golf league so we chose Terre Blanche as a top destination for the hole-in-one sponsorship. We have WGC in more than 40 countries worldwide and we are still growing, and we want to support amateur golf.\"\n\nThe Terre Blanche Hotel Spa Golf Resort is home to two 18-hole courses (Le Chateau and Le Riou) designed by Dave Thomas. Le Chateau is the venue of the Senior European Tour's event, \"The French Riviera Masters\", while Le Riou plays host to the Ladies European Tour Access Series, \"The Terre Blanche Ladies Open.\"\n\nAmbient Lounge is also returning this year as a partner in the BT Corporate Golf League. The global brand was invited to be a partner just before BT Corporate Golf League 2013, and according to Yao Chin Leng, Ambient Lounge's Business Development Manager, it has been a very happy and fruitful partnership. The total value of the sponsorship this year is more than $5,000 and each round the company is providing a Butterfly Sofa (worth $499 each) and assorted Tech Pillows (worth $49 each).\n\n\"Being involved in the League has allowed us to create awareness among the C-level executives of Ambient Lounge as the global brand that has evolved shapeless bean bags into contemporary designer furniture,\" Mr Yao explains, continuing: \"The eye-catching designs of our bean bags have hopefully also helped spice up the prize ceremonies during the dinners, and contributed to the jovial atmosphere. And, of course, an Ambient Lounge bean bag is always a beautiful and practical piece for the home of the lucky winners.\"\n\nThis year's BT Corporate Golf League venues include rounds at three of Singapore's top clubs - notably Singapore Island Country Club (New Course), Tanah Merah Country Club (Tampines and Garden), and Sentosa Golf Club (Tanjong and Serapong) - and will also include the redeveloped course at Jurong Country Club.\n\nThe first round will take place on July 2 on Sentosa Golf Club's Tanjong course.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This reflects overarching wariness that any tightening through regulations or a rise in interest rates would have more impact in this part of the world now than before, though analysts have indicated that the current addiction to debt in Asia is unlikely to spark a credit crisis in the region.\n\nSingapore joins Thailand in registering a jump in household debt to GDP ratios between 2007 and 2013 that is bigger than that of the US for the period between 2001 and 2007, HSBC's note said. Economists measure household debt against GDP as one way to show the extent that economic growth can cover the amount of debt racked up.\n\n\"Household debt may not be as big a systemic financial risk as it was in the West, but it highlights a potential growth problem in Asia: without it, how resilient would consumption spending really be?\" said HSBC economist Frederic Neumann in the report.\n\nOther analysts have earlier flagged concerns over Asian debt. In February last year, S&P's analyst, Tan Kim Eng, noted in a report that loose monetary conditions may be \"magnifying financial and economic risks\".\n\n\"The conditions that supported robust economic growth in the region could turn less supportive in the future. In the current circumstances, a lack of regulatory vigilance could create possible financial instability,\" Mr Tan said.\n\nBut he also argued that debt-to-GDP ratios can overstate financial risk in some economies, particularly for financial centres such as Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\nFor example, companies may take loans from domestic banks to invest abroad, and these projects may not count towards the home economy's GDP.\n\nOCBC, which has the second-largest construction loan book in Singapore, said earlier this year that more property developers are taking loans from the bank for projects in London and Australia.\n\nIn a comparison of Singapore and Hong Kong, Barclays analyst Sharnie Wong said in a March report that Singapore banks have shown greater discipline in pricing loans.\n\nIn Singapore, personal loans - excluding those for housing - are typically secured against collateral, and the size of unsecured lending is restricted based on the individual's income.\n\nA person who earns more than $30,000 a year can be offered an unsecured loan of about four times his monthly salary. The bank may raise this ratio for a person who earns at least $120,000 a year.\n\nAnd, Singapore is now reviewing rules for money-lending - usually for unsecured loans - and will look at, among other things, the cap on the total of such loans taken by each borrower.\n\nBy contrast, personal loans in Hong Kong are mostly unsecured, since lending rates can be as low as 2 per cent, and loan size can be up to 18 times of monthly income, Ms Wong said.\n\nIn Singapore, household debt-to-GDP ratio stood at about 75 per cent last year. This is higher than Hong Kong's 62 per cent, though for Hong Kong, that is its historic high.\n\nOver here, the debt ratio had breached the 90 per cent mark in 2002 and 2003, and household debt has since eased after the government introduced a borrowing cap for property loans, known as the total debt servicing ratio, Ms Wong said.\n\nHousing loans in Singapore make up about three-quarters of all consumer loans, which stood at $228 billion in April.\n\nS&P's Mr Tan noted high domestic saving rates for some parts of Asia offer a buffer against rising debt. He also highlighted that Asia's total leverage - which includes debt from the public and private sectors - remains \"well lower\" than in much of Europe, given the relatively lower government borrowings.\n\nThere are now brewing concerns over China's government debt, though this is mainly focused on local government debt, Mark Austen, CEO of Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a finance-trade body, told BT in an interview.\n\nChina's overall local-government debt stood at 17.9 trillion yuan (S$3.6 trillion) - or about a third of its GDP - for the first six months through to June last year, said media reports that cited China's National Audit Office figures.\n\nIn January, a Forbes article highlighted Singapore's \"significant public debt\".\n\nBut government borrowings here are not used to fund spending in a country that rarely runs a budget deficit. The sovereign bonds are issued mainly to create a government yield curve, used then to price other securities, such as private debt.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the echoing chamber of my business class seat, there was - dare I say it - almost enough room in which to swing a cat.\n\nYou think you're prepared for your first time, but you are never, really. My colleagues, many of whom remember their own business-class dalliances with fuzzy-eyed nostalgia, had done their best to induct me, pre-flight.\n\n\"The flight crew will call you 'Ms Hooi' in business class,\" one of them had told me in a half-whisper.\n\n\"How do you know this? Did they call you 'Ms Hooi' too?\" I'd asked him.\n\nObjects that are of token value on the ground are suddenly elevated to the status of prized possessions several thousand feet in the air. \"You will be offered magazines,\" a seasoned business-class traveller sagely told me.\n\nThis is old hat to our readers, of course, who must fly business class as often as I take the train. But have you ever noticed, dear reader, the minute wonders of business class, such as how the nuts that are served in those little ramekins are palpably warm?\n\nWhat sorcery is this? Are there little gnomes in the galley who keep the cashews and almonds nice and toasty in their armpits until such time as the passengers get peckish?\n\nAlso, have you, dear reader, ever left the ramekin out for hours before proffering them to a stewardess, asking her to warm your nuts?\n\nOn the flight, I put my things away in the seat's many compartments; all that was missing was room for my Egyptian beetle collection. I remember an economy class flight from several years ago, you know, back when I was still living in the 'hood.\n\nThat time, as I boarded the plane, I had been stuck behind a man who - as we passed the spacious seats that our plebeian behinds would not occupy - repeatedly said: \"I shoulda studied harder in school, guys.\"\n\nI had been mildly irritated - partially because I am living proof that studying hard does not inoculate you from having to inhabit a space the size of a broom closet for hours. Also, I couldn't understand raging against the gods of aviation. In the Zen of economy-class flying, you learn to just be. Be still, mostly.\n\nBut largely, I had been discomfited because there is nothing like having to walk past seats that you cannot afford, en route to 19 miserable hours of deep vein thrombosis and plastic cutlery, to make you assess your own life with a gimlet eye.\n\nHere, in a metal tube hurtling through space, you face an indictment of all the choices you have made in life that have brought you cheek-by-jowl with someone else's squalling baby.\n\nAirlines must know that they don't really need that curtain that they draw between the two classes. You could technically twitch it back; your limbs function the same as those belonging to the besuited passengers up front. But it is your mind that keeps your body from trespassing in that vale of gentility.\n\nAt some point, airlines will discover that even without the curtain, an economy class passenger approaching business class will rebound Matrix-style off some invisible forcefield that is powered by cattle-class inferiority and underachievement.\n\nWrong expectation\n\nSo, on this latest flight, I finally satisfied my curiosity about business-class passengers - I mean, real ones, not interlopers like me. Up till then, my image of them had been informed by a Seinfeld episode in which Jerry is upgraded to first class and seated next to a supermodel.\n\nAs cattle class behind them becomes a squirming fleshy mass of sweat and bad behaviour, Jerry and the model clink champagne glasses and discuss the gardenias in the first-class bathroom. They laugh like dolphins.\n\nThat was the relaxed bonhomie I had been primed to expect of my fellow business-class passengers, but I was wrong.\n\nThe passengers around me - balding executives and well-coiffed women - wore the pinched expression of people who had done something heinous, paid an unspeakable price, to get this far in life.\n\nOn one leg of the flight, the man next to me holds up one finger at the stewardess when she crouches next to him to ask for his meal choice. \"I need to write this email,\" he says to his BlackBerry without looking at her. She stays there until he's done.\n\nWhen I wake up briefly, a lady with a laptop across the aisle is berating another stewardess, her voice tight with stress. \"The WiFi is not. Working. At. All,\" she says through teeth so gritted, I fear for her fillings.\n\nI roll over and go back to sleep. I don't know if the WiFi is working, and I don't care. I am just happy my nuts are warm.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 20, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nMOVE over, South America. The next big travel destination could well be another big continent - Africa, to be exact - according to travel experts.\n\n\"Africa has always enchanted travellers. The untouched nature and variety of wildlife is not found anywhere else in the world,\" says Caroline Lam, executive director of Quintessentially Travel, a premium lifestyle travel management service. \"With people becoming more curious and open to immersing themselves in different cultures, the classic safaris, namely Kenya and Tanzania, are popular. Tourists also flock to South Africa for opulence and other non-safari activities as there are some of the top private luxury safari lodges, charming cities and wine activities.\"\n\nAfrica is a big continent with 54 countries, so knowing which one to visit can be tricky. Victor Dizon, co-founder of safari consultancy firm, Asia to Africa Safaris, recommends Zimbabwe, Uganda and Ethiopia.\n\n\"These countries are still relatively undiscovered and unexplored even by intrepid travellers,\" says Mr Dizon, who has been helping travellers organise safaris for 12 years. \"And these places are now undergoing a tourism renaissance in terms of new lodges being built and being easier and friendlier for travellers to visit.\"\n\nHe points out that Zimbabwe has enormous tracts of wilderness filled with a diverse range of African wildlife species, \"and comparing it to other African countries, this is probably a country with the best value for money\". Getting access to the key wildlife areas is also fast, easy and efficient. \"Plus, there is the ease of getting visas on arrival for most Asian citizens, which means less hassle when travelling,\" he says.\n\nUganda gets Mr Dizon's vote, because the country offers both gorilla and chimpanzee tracking, and together with the Serengeti, \"is the best place to watch Africa's greatest land mammal migration\".\n\nEthiopia may not be an immediate holiday destination that comes to mind, but the country has both culture and wildlife diversity. Some of the most adorned and colourful tribesmen of Africa live in the Omo Valley, and Ethiopia is also home to Aksum, a town rumoured to be the home of the bibilical Ark of the Covenant, which houses the Ten Commandments that God gave the prophet Moses. Wildlife-wise, the Simien Mountains is where the simien fox and the gelada baboon live.\n\nRufus Tan, a director at Quotient Travelplanner, highly recommends Botswana, Kenya and Tanzania. \"Camps in Botswana are small and private, where you will almost never find more than 20 guests at a time,\" says Mr Tan. \"With such a limited disturbance from the outside world, you are guaranteed a pristine wilderness teeming with a fascinating contingent of wild animals.\n\nEast Africa, where Kenya and Tanzania are, \"is a true nature lover's paradise, as you can get up close and observe the behaviour of wild animals in their natural habitat that has been relatively unchanged for hundreds of years\", says Mr Tan.\n\nAnother African nation that looks set to be popular is Mozambique, according to Lightfoot Travel. Few people visited the country during its civil war years in the 1980s and 1990s. But over the last decade, a growing number of luxury lodges have opened in the Quirimbas Archipelago in the north and Bazaruto Archipelago in the south.\n\nExotic outings in Brazil\n\nThe country offers travellers lots of beach activities such as diving, snorkelling, deep-sea fishing, deserted island picnics and mobile dhow-cruise island camping.\n\nBut if you haven't gotten around to visiting South America yet, don't fret. Travel experts say the continent is still fairly popular, thanks to the ongoing World Cup.\n\nChua Hui Wan, CEO of Zuji Singapore, says Brazil has always been an exotic holiday destination, \"but it is one that's on the rise - particularly following the 2014 World Cup and the upcoming 2016 Olympic Games.\"\n\nShe adds that while the two events are going to be widely popular, the carnival-busy country will keep travellers constantly moving with street parties and music-filled metropolises and friendly people. If you haven't booked your tickets yet for this year, Ms Chua recommends planning for Feb 13 to 18 next year, when the annual carnival in Rio de Janeiro takes place.\n\nHot on the heels of Brazil's World Cup, there has been increasing interest in Latin America, and Mexico is one of the most accessible countries in this region with incredible links to the United States, according to Lightfoot Travel.\n\nIts managing director Simon Cameron says that Mexico has appeal because of its wonderful diversity - from the surfing beaches of the Pacific Coast and remote kayaking trips from Puerto Vallarta, to its perfectly preserved colonial towns and white sandy beaches in the Yucatan Peninsula - all with opulent and luxurious hotel choices to boot.\n\nWhen it comes to modes of transport, rail holidays will continue to rise in popularity with travellers in the next half of 2014 and beyond,\" says Jeremiah Wong, marketing communications manager for Chan Brothers Travel. \"Europe will continue to be the shining star with its well-developed rail infrastructure and excellent cross-border connectivity.\" Some of the firm's popular rail packages are to Southern France, Eastern Europe and Switzerland. \"Cross continent rail journeys across Australia are also gaining interest,\" he says.\n\nExperts say that travellers are not only choosing exotic locales, but also opting for more unusual forms of accommodation. Chai Jia Jih, Airbnb's managing director for South-east Asia and India says that \"in the second half of 2014 and early 2015, we expect quirky accommodation types to continue riding high on travellers' agenda, as people increasingly seek out unusual spaces that make accommodation a destination in its own right.\"\n\nHe says that Airbnb is seeing a growing trend of travellers going for unique accommodation listings such as houseboats, cabins, airstreams and even igloos. \"As people get more adventurous, it has also led to the rise in demand for authentic local experiences that allow them to truly immerse themselves in the culture and soul of a destination,\" adds Mr Chai.\n\nHotels.com's regional director Katherine Cole notes that another gradually emerging trend is the demand for boutique hotels that offer themed accommodation. Travel accommodation is no longer deemed as just a box to rest up for the night, but increasingly an experience in its own right.\"\n\nAnd if you are still stumped for places to visit, seeking the opinion of millions of worldwide travellers can't be wrong. TripAdvisor recently unveiled this year's Travellers' Choice Destinations, which honour top travel spots based on millons of reviews and opinions from its users.\n\nThe top five destinations are Istanbul, Rome, London, Beijing and Prague. Award-winners are determined using an algorithm that takes into account the quantity and quality of reviews and ratings for hotels, attractions and restaurants in destinations worldwide, gathered over a 12-month period.\n\n\"We have more than 150 million reviews and opinions on the site. Quality and quantity matter, as it reveals the wisdom of the crowds and informs these lists,\" says Cindy Tan, vice-president of TripAdvisor APAC. \"Our global travellers are the tastemakers for uncovering the best places to visit around the world.\"\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\n@TaySuanChiangBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It was a market solely supplied by CityGas, the monopoly town gas retailer here, until now.\n\nDisclosing that 10 out of 12 respondents to the consultation had supported the liberalisation move, the regulator said in its decision paper that \"with the opening up of the market . . . gas retailers can also market their natural gas services to new commercial and industrial consumers outside the JIT areas who are yet to be connected to the natural gas distribution network\".\n\nTemasek-owned companies, Gas Supply Pte Ltd (GSPL), which imports piped natural gas from Indonesia, and Pavilion Gas, the newly formed LNG player, noted that the EMA move will \"engender competition in the Singapore gas market to create more supply options for customers\".\n\nGSPL said that EMA should ensure that all enablers for this are in place - such as the availability of pipeline capacities to make gas supply feasible for consumers outside the JIT areas.\n\nSimilarly, Keppel Gas highlighted that \"existing infrastructure constraints, arising from the two transmission networks and their corresponding distribution networks being physically disconnected, limit gas buyers to only retailers serving that particular transmission network\".\n\nSembGas said that \"there could be overwhelming requests for new connections to tap-off from the natural gas distribution network which the retailers will have to work closely with PowerGas for the timely delivery of gas to the customers\".\n\nTheir responses were noted by EMA which conceded that \"there are currently technical constraints in the natural gas networks which could restrict the flow of natural gas from one network to another\". \"EMA is working with the gas transporter, PowerGas Ltd, to mitigate these constraints.\"\n\nNew gas pipelines may need to be laid for this purpose, and this could possibly take up to next year, industry sources say. They added that outside the JIT area - where most of the gencos and big petrochemical/refinery plants are - the next biggest gas consumers here are the big wafer fab plants which are sited in the north.\n\nConocoPhillips, which supplies Indonesian gas to Singapore gas importers, said that the market liberalisation \"will improve the liquidity of the gas market in Singapore\", while Singapore Oxygen Air Liquide said that the ensuing competition will benefit consumers like itself.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In contrast, those below this stratosphere - the \"poorer\" ones with between US$1 million and US$5 million - jointly hold US$5 trillion.\n\nAnd the best thing? Sixty per cent of this US$5 trillion or so is under-served, or, in bank parlance, \"unmanaged\".\n\nDBS's strategy to attracting TPCs is to offer them private bank services, and these include access to pre-IPO sales, discretionary portfolio management and other investment services.\n\nThese clients also have dedicated luxury airport lounges at Changi, which offer massages, a full suite of banking services and free limousine rides (in Singapore, Jakarta, Surabaya and Taiwan).\n\nLast year, revenues from group wealth management rose 10.3 per cent to almost $1 billion - faster than its growth rate of 9.7 per cent in 2012.\n\nThe increase came from strong gains in fee income (from product sales), which rose 30 per cent last year; in contrast, the increase from lending activities or net interest income was only 4 per cent.\n\nThe most popular investment products are equities, bonds and funds, and the amount traded has steadily risen. \"The ticket size has gone up,\" said Mr Koh.\n\nTPC made up 18 per cent of group wealth-management revenues last year, up from 3 per cent in 2011; it is projected to hit 25 per cent next year, he said.\n\nMore TPC-type customers are projected to be knocking on DBS's door too - Mr Koh expects 15 to 20 per cent more in the next few years.\n\nAssets under management from wealth management clients, that is, those with at least $350,000, grew to $109 billion last year, up from $94 billion in 2012.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Debbie Yong looks at how popular indie F&B brands are parlaying their compact operations into second ventures\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 20, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE tale of David trumping Goliath isn't new, but it seems to have uncanny resonance in the restaurant industry of late. While large restaurant groups are closing excess outlets or scaling down their fine-dining venues to offer high-volume casual grub instead, independent F&B outfits are happily surviving - and even thriving.\n\nAt least eight independent eateries have launched or are about to open second outlets with new concepts in the coming weeks. All this amid common grouses from restaurateurs over escalating rents, short-term leases, the crippling quota on foreign labour, and the shortage of skilled and willing local staff.\n\nWhile the same issues dog the Davids of the local restaurant industry, many say that growth in such a competitive climate is still possible for small eateries, and staff retention is pivotal to managing their expansions.\n\nMuchachos's Jonathan Yang, who will launch protein-centric health food eatery The Daily Cut next month, says this means not treating his staff like employees.\n\nHe and co-founder Elson Lee regularly treat their team of 12 to 15 staff, including part-timers, to \"appreciation meals\" in a restaurant of their choice. From hotel buffets to seafood restaurant The Cajun Kings, \"we don't scrimp on our welfare practices\", says Mr Yang. Employees are further incentivised with profit-sharing bonuses based on good performance, such as $100 in extra wages if they go without taking medical leave for the month. \"In the one year that we've been operating, we've only received one MC, and never a complete no-show,\" he adds.\n\n\"In a smaller venture, you're on the ground every day, you ask your staff how their mum is, you let them have a day off to visit their mum in hospital - essentially you share with them parts of your life as they do with theirs. We care about them as human beings, and it clearly makes a difference,\" Mr Yang says. \"Because at the end of the day, you can install all the welfare practices you want, but if they don't feel like you really give a damn, you are not going to reap the benefits.\"\n\nTo others, expanding the business is a necessary means to keep staff motivated. \"The unfortunate reality is that working in the F&B industry is not considered a proper profession in Singapore, there's so much stigma against being in a service role,\" says Benjamin Lee of week-old The Lokal, a sister outlet to popular Telok Ayer sandwich cafe Sarnies. He also opened his first overseas venture Jump Cafe in Kuala Lumpur last month. With the new outlets come new leadership positions that existing staff can aspire to.\n\n\"What we try to do at Sarnies is empower employees by giving them opportunities to map out a career with us,\" he explains. One of his head baristas at Sarnies, Eric Chan, for example, is now managing Jump Cafe, while he's taken on former staffer Louise Tong-Davies as a business partner for The Lokal.\n\nIt helped, too, that the new outlets helped to stretch existing fixed costs, he adds. \"We had 30 staff for one cafe, including a back-end team focusing on finance and human resources. It was an infrastructure that could easily support three to four more outlets.\"\n\nFor Jeremy Cheok, his second baby came somewhat unintentionally. The private chef behind casual bistro OKB was merely looking for a larger prep kitchen to supplement OKB's 500 sq ft kitchen when he came across the 2,000 sq ft unit that currently houses his second restaurant, Slake. He originally wanted to lease the dining room out to tenants to run as a separate restaurant that he would supply from the back kitchen, but found it more cost-effective to run the whole place himself.\n\nSmaller businesses have an advantage in their shorter response time to customer feedback and new ideas, he notes. \"We have fewer people to answer to and contracts with suppliers to alter. I can change my menu within a day, or a few hours - all we have to do is print a new one on the spot.\"\n\nEven the lack of financial muscle compared to the top dogs is no reason to not keep pace. The Humble Loaf's Dillon Ng believes that as long as one focuses on making a good product, rather than actively courting investors, the opportunities will come knocking.\n\nHis new business partner for his upcoming, five-times-as-large outlet Gastrosmiths is a regular patron who saw potential in the 10-seater's growing queues, and a few of his staff similarly came on board after dining at his eatery.\n\n\"It helped that we had similar ideals but yet different strengths,\" says Mr Ng of his partner Heng Tong Jin. A stockbroker by day, Mr Heng will focus on business development so that Mr Ng can do what he does best: cooking.\n\nWhen they expand to future outlets, Mr Ng says he hopes to likewise let his sous chefs run the show, with concepts fashioned around their personal interests or cooking styles, rather than a cookie-cutter replica of Gastrosmiths.\n\nAlong the same vein, Muchachos's Mr Yang believes that maintaining a sense of individuality is the key selling point for independent brands. Though he had initially aimed to open two to three more outlets of his San Francisco Mission-style burrito eatery in Singapore, he has since shelved those plans.\n\n\"Muchachos has somehow taken on a slightly iconic status here,\" says Mr Yang, who is now talking to potential partners in Hong Kong, Manila and Jakarta instead. \"We don't want to hurt the brand by turning it from a nice little spot that serves great burritos to yet another chain restaurant.\"\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\n@DebbieYongBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We need to nurture our ties with them, and encourage Americans, in government or outside, to remember their many friends and interests in the region,\" Mr Lee wrote in a Facebook post yesterday.\n\nWhile in the US capital this time, he will have meetings in the White House and with several Cabinet secretaries; he will also meet principal figures in the US Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\nMr Lee has two speaking engagements during the Washington leg.

The fuel savings are among the first concrete improvements from NextGen, which uses GPS-based navigation and Internet-like communications with aircraft to make flying safer and more efficient. The project is being phased in through 2025.\n\n\"The NextGen Metroplex we are implementing today is an example for the entire country - of the difference we can make with the help of the federal government and the way we get it done - six months ahead of schedule,\" Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said.\n\nIn addition to Houston, the FAA is rerouting flights in more than a dozen other metro areas with heavy airline traffic, including Atlanta, North Texas and Washington. A similar programme is also underway to untangle New York's three airports, which produce the most airline delays in the nation, according to Transportation Department data.\n\nThe Houston project was selected by President Barack Obama as one of 14 high-priority infrastructure projects that were put on a fast track for completion. The agency initially planned to complete the project in three years. It was finished six months early.\n\nOne of the ways of saving fuel is to give planes a continuous descent allowing them to glide using minimal power from over 30,000 feet to within a few thousand feet of the ground, according to the FAA. Under older procedures, an airliner arriving at most airports would be instructed to descend and level off several times, using more fuel than is needed.\n\nAnother way the FAA gained efficiency in Houston was to allow planes to fly precise routes made possible by the global positioning satellite system, according to the FAA.\n\nThose routes allow planes to fly shorter distances to the runway, saving fuel. Under NextGen, aircraft use GPS to establish their own position and then broadcast that to other aircraft and the ground, which is a more accurate way of tracking planes than radar. The GPS also allows planes to repeatedly fly the same track, allowing the FAA to create the more efficient routes.\n\nThe Houston initiative was endorsed by Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc. United Airlines uses Houston's Bush Intercontinental Airport as a hub.\n\n\"This redesigned airspace allows us to take full advantage of technology we already have on our aircraft, while simultaneously reducing fuel burn and emissions,\" said Jim Compton, United's vice-chairman and chief revenue officer.\n\nThe National Air Traffic Controllers Association also applauded the changes, said president Paul Rinaldi. The union representing about 15,000 controllers had baulked at some attempts to revamp airways when president George W Bush was in office.\n\nThe FAA's effort to untangle flight routes in busy metropolitan areas has at times run into complaints about aircraft noise. Even if total noise in a region is reduced, rerouting flights can concentrate aircraft sounds over some neighbourhoods. Residents in New York's Queens Borough have raised objections to new flight tracks for departures from LaGuardia Airport.\n\nThe FAA has completed a network of ground receivers in the United States that track planes using the satellite-based system, the agency said in April. The system was built under a contract with McLean, Virginia-based Exelis Inc.

There is no such company on the Singapore Exchange; overseas-listed companies that derive at least 10 per cent of their revenues from Iran and Iraq are London-listed Genel Energy; Hong Kong-listed Termbray Petro-King Oilfield Services; Oslo-listed DNO ASA; London-listed Gulf Keystone Petroleum and Tokyo-listed Japan Drilling.\n\nOil prices reached a nine-month high of more than US$114 a barrel earlier this week as escalating violence in Iraq - the world's seventh largest producer and Opec's second biggest producer - unnerved financial markets.\n\nSunni militants led by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (known as ISIS) had taken over a few Iraqi cities, including the second-biggest one Mosul, and were said to be less than 25 kilometres away from Baghdad.\n\nOCBC's baseline forecast is for WTI and Brent to dip to US$90 a barrel and US$95 barrel respectively, in the absence of geopolitical risks. But this could go up to as high as US$120 a barrel, estimated OCBC commodities analyst Barnabas Gan, if the Sunni militants move into southern Iraq where most of the country's oil production and export facilities are located and are still unaffected by violence.\n\nTraders and analysts estimate that a loss of all of Iraq's exports would add at least US$40-US$50 to the price of a barrel of oil, the Financial Times reported yesterday.\n\nWith prices for crude palm oil being positively correlated with crude oil prices due to its bio-diesel link, upstream plantation owners such as Golden Agri, First Resources and Bumitama Agri would benefit from higher oil prices too, said OCBC, noting that even without any additional demand for bio-diesel, the expected arrival of El Nino is already expected to have a negative impact on crude palm oil supply.\n\nOn the other hand, airlines and shipping firms would be among the companies disadvantaged by higher oil prices. \"Firms that are unable to pass on the higher costs to customers would find their margins being eroded,\" said Ms Low and Mr Wong. \"Though companies can protect themselves against fuel price spikes by hedging, that also costs money and involves the use of derivatives.\"\n\nIn the 2014 financial year, fuel costs made up 38 per cent of total costs for Singapore Airlines, and 43.1 per cent for Tiger Airways. OCBC estimates the number to be about 20-25 per cent for container carrier Neptune Orient Lines.\n\nLand transport operators such as ComfortDelGro and SMRT are likely to be less affected, since fuel and electricity costs formed about 8.7 per cent of ComfortDelGro's operating expenses in the 2013 financial year, and 14.6 per cent for SMRT in the 2014 financial year.\n\nWhile higher oil prices could feed across the entire economy and crimp corporate margins, CIMB head of research Kenneth Ng is optimistic that the impact of geopolitical tension should be less acute going forward, since a variety of new sources such as shale gas in the US and deepwater oil fields have been added to the energy mix.\n\n\"Hence, the impact of such events on a more permanent rise in oil prices and the associated hit on corporate profits should be more transient,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It follows hot on the heels of Chen's historic win of the highly coveted Camera d'Or award for his debut feature, Ilo Ilo, last year, and the number of films picked for the prestigious event sets a new record for the local film industry.\n\nOf the four, Oh Lucy!, by writer-director Atsuko Hirayanagi from the Singapore-based NYU Tisch School of the Arts Asia took home the second prize in the 17th Cin\u00e9fondation Selection - which runs parallel to the festival's Official Selection and was created to support and inspire the next generation of international filmmakers. American filmmaker Annie Silverstein was awarded the top prize by the jury - led by veteran Iranian writer-director-producer, Abbas Kiarostami - for her short film, Skunk.\n\nHirayanagi's Oh Lucy! was one of 1,631 works submitted by budding international directors from 457 film schools around the world. Only 16 were eventually shortlisted for the competition, including Last Trip Home by Han Fengyu from Ngee Ann Polytechnic School of Film and Media Studies.\n\nThe other two local works featured at Cannes were K Rajagopal's A Yellow Bird and Allysa Sing's On An Infinite Loop. The former was selected as one of the 15 titles in the Cin\u00e9fondation L'Atelier section, where emerging filmmakers get to link up with potential backers and other professionals from the industry. The latter screened at the Short Film Corner, a platform for newcomers to showcase content for possible selection at other international festivals, as well as to network with their peers and business partners.\n\nShortlist surprise\n\nSuffice to say, the Cannes experience proved to be a priceless one for all the filmmakers whose works were invited as their projects also inched closer to the ultimate goal - developing it into a feature film. Many were caught by surprise when their works were shortlisted by the jury.\n\n\"The selection process seems like a black box with more than 1,600 shorts (vying) for 16 spots (so) the selected group was very diverse,\" notes Hirayanagi, a Japanese national who had no filmmaking experience prior to coming to Singapore where she received the Cathay Scholarship from exhibitor-distributor Cathay Organisation to study at Tisch Asia and graduated with an MFA in Film Production.\n\nOh Lucy! was her graduation thesis project and most of the interior scenes were shot in Singapore while the rest was filmed in Japan. The 21-minute short also stars Momoi Kaori (Memoirs of a Geisha, Sukiyaki Western Django), who's known as the Meryl Streep of Japan for her versatility and numerous acting awards. The veteran actress plays a 55-year-old single \"office lady\" who assumes a new identity and whose inner desires are awoken after she dons a blonde wig.\n\nIt won the top prize at the Wasserman Award at Tisch Asia's First Run Film Festival earlier this year before being invited to Cannes but surprisingly, things weren't always smooth-sailing for Hirayanagi's film. \"There was no Media Development Authority (MDA) support - I was rejected twice, including two appeals, for the development fund and marketing scheme,\" laughs the mother of two who was seven months pregnant during the six-and-a-half day shoot, before adding that MDA did eventually support with promotion and press efforts after the film got into Cannes.\n\nThe Ilo Ilo ripple effect\n\nGiven the global stage the Singapore film industry has somewhat found itself on after Chen's moment of glory at Cannes last year, a bigger spotlight was shone on locals works at this year's festival.\n\nRajagopal says he has \"no complaints\" about that as it made people take an interest in his script for A Yellow Bird. It is the only title from Asia among 15 other international projects and the first Singaporean film to be selected for the 10th Cin\u00e9fondation's L'Atelier. Inspired by what his late mother used to tell him about making a wish whenever a yellow bird appears, the plot revolves around an Indian ex-convict who tries to seek redemption for his past actions and reconnect with loved ones whom he had hurt when he is released from prison.\n\nOne of the eight recipients of the Singapore Film Commission's New Talent Feature Grant - which supports first or second-time feature filmmakers with a grant of up to $250,000 - Rajagopal notes that Chen's win made people more aware of the cosmopolitan nature of our industry, especially for a filmmakers of a minority race like himself.\n\n\"Before that, people used to ask, 'Are you from China or India?', but now they know,\" he says, before adding that some of the professionals he met who were mostly in their 20s and 30s were also intrigued that a 49-year-old like him was making his first feature. \"Ilo Ilo is very Singaporean because it's set here, yet it has managed to reach an international audience . . . in the same way, it gave me confidence that my script is able to reach beyond Singapore.\"\n\nAlthough nothing has been firmed up and Rajagopal is hesitant about putting the cart before the horse, the exposure A Yellow Bird got has proved invaluable as discussions with distributors like Wild Bunch, the independent Paris-based European film distribution company behind award-winning indies like the recent lesbian drama Blue is the Warmest Colour and 2011 Best Film Oscar winner The Artist, means the self-taught freelance television and film director's feature could be set for a global stage once it's completed.\n\nHirayanagi, on the other hand, believes that any sort of spotlight local films got at Cannes wasn't entirely based on Ilo Ilo's win but was also due to \"strong works coming out of Singapore\" and was full of praise for Last Trip Home by Han, who could not be reached at press time. The latter, like Hirayanagi, isn't originally from Singapore - Han moved from China when he was 11 years old and has been pursuing a diploma in film for the past three years at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Last Trip Home - much like Hirayanagi's Oh Lucy!, which is based on her experience of living in Japan and America - also touches on the diaspora issue as it tells the story of an immigrant and his son who decide to give up their struggles in Singapore and drive back to China with their only possession - their car.\n\nLearning from Cannes\n\nAlthough only Oh Lucy! managed to win a prize at this year's festival, the invited filmmakers all agree that the Cannes experience has been nothing short of eye-opening as they picked up something new about their craft.\n\nRajagopal says he has gained more confidence in selling A Yellow Bird to strangers. \"When you're pitching it for the 32nd time, you get stronger and tell the story better each time,\" he says. \"It's scary when you put a film out there; you don't know what the reaction is going to be.\"\n\nOthers like Sing, for instance, did not feel any pressure because her 14-minute On An Infinite Loop - about a daughter who revisits her old apartment a decade later only to discover her father living there with a stranger - was not in competition but felt honoured nonetheless that it was picked to be screened at the festival's Short Film Corner.\n\nThe 24-year-old says she was inspired all the same by her peers even though she admits to feeling like \"a small fish\". Sing, whose first short film, Crane Wife, gained both local and international exposure and awards, says she learnt about marketing her work there and was told by an industry professional that sometimes not winning any award can actually be a good thing.\n\nShe shares: \"He told us that will actually give your film a longer shelf life because some festivals prefer to showcase new works instead of something that has already (been well-received or won something) somewhere else.\"\n\ndylantan@sph.com.sg\n\n@DylanTanSYBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In contrast, family-controlled companies mainly rewarded themselves with cash bonuses.\n\nAccording to the 2012 Code of Corporate Governance, performance-related remuneration should be aligned with the interests of shareholders and promote the long-term success of the company. It also said that firms must disclose the exact amount paid to executive directors, or explain why they did not.\n\nUOB finally did so last year; it used to report pay in $250,000 bands.\n\nSuper Group's Teo Kee Bock made it into the list this year, at 16th; in 2012 all shareholders knew was that he earned more than $500,000.\n\nThe table threw up interesting nuggets. A minnow such as United Envirotech, which posted profit before tax (PBT) of $39 million, paid chief executive Lin Yucheng $5.76 million last year, a 821 per cent jump in pay.\n\nMr Lin's hefty reward, which catapulted him to 13th on the list, came from a grant of 12 million share options valued by Freshwater Advisers at $4.88 million.\n\nLast year, American private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR), paid US$40 million to raise its stake in United Envirotech, a water treatment and recycling solution provider in China. KKR made its first investment, a US$113.8 million capital injection via convertible bonds, in 2011.\n\nKKR is the largest shareholder, with more than 16 per cent, and has three directors on board.\n\nJon Robinson, managing director of Freshwater Advisers, said that the single grant share options should be seen as a long-term incentive.\n\nHe believes that the process in which KKR determined the incentive for Mr Lin was a reasonable one and that while KKR was acting in its own interest, the consequence is that all shareholders should benefit.\n\n\"I have no concern . . . KKR knows how to create value for shareholders, as they are one,\" said Mr Robinson.\n\nMaking it into the top 10 were chiefs from three smallish companies in terms of profit, due to their outsized cash bonuses.\n\nFragrance Group's Koh Wee Meng and Aspial Corp's Koh Wee Seng got over $6 million each while Ho Bee's Chua Thian Poh received $5.5 million.\n\nTheir cash bonuses were several multiples of their salaries; in the case of Aspial's Mr Koh, it was 26 times. Aspial's revenue rose 14 per cent and its PBT surged 28 per cent from the last financial year.\n\nMr Robinson noted that when Aspial listed in 1999, there was a profit-sharing arrangement set out in the service agreements and disclosed in the prospectus. The profit share formula gave a maximum of 3.5 per cent of profits to Mr Koh.\n\nThe amount paid in 2013 was some 8 per cent of profits. This percentage is almost double the next highest in the top 30 list, he said.\n\n\"That profit-share formula has ratcheted up over the years, that is not good, you've got a controlling shareholder . . . it appears to be excessive,\" he said.\n\nGetting into the list was Oxley Holdings' Ching Chiat Kwong, whose pay jumped 3.5 times to $5.13 million, largely from a cash bonus of $4.77 million. Oxley's PBT more than quadrupled to $123 million.\n\nWhile there has been improvement in pay disclosure, corporate governance standards between Singapore and other comparable jurisdictions is widening, said Mr Robinson.\n\n\"Singapore is falling considerably in the global table on this, not in terms of its principles but in practice - where the guidelines are being ignored and the regulator is not taking any positive step to ensure compliance with the Code,\" he said.\n\n\"Governance is generally stronger in London and Australia; the governance environment in Hong Kong seems weaker in principle but stronger in practice,\" he said.\n\nThere were 29 companies which did not follow the Code on pay disclosure.\n\nCompanies which do not disclose have to explain and the reason often cited is \"competitive reasons\".\n\n\"When that person owns 60 per cent of that company, that person is not going to walk away,\" said Mr Robinson.\n\nFreshwater looked at companies with a market capitalisation of more than $100 million - and covered 297.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Without question.\"\n\nSpeaking to Reuters at the training ground of Sport Club do Recife, where Juninho honed his technique as a young professional before moving to Europe, Wendel explained why the former Lyon and Brazil midfielder was the best in the business. \"I was able to follow him as a rival in France, when I played in Bordeaux and he was at Lyon, and as a team mate here at Vasco da Gama,\" he explained.\n\n\"The most complete taker of free kicks was Juninho, both from close up and from far away. From close up, he was able to lift the ball over the wall; and from long distances, he could make the ball's trajectory change completely,\" he said. \"If you analyse Juninho, you'd have the most complete free kick taker. I'd call it perfection, really.\"\n\nJuninho scored dozens of goals from free kicks in a career that saw him win seven league titles in France with Lyon and 40 caps for Brazil before retiring from the game in 2013 at the age of 38.\n\nNow among the ranks of Juninho's successors as one of the players who takes free kicks at Sport, Wendel that says a lot of hard work goes into becoming an expert like his predecessor or Roberto Carlos.\n\n\"The best characteristic you can have is the training, day after day, perfecting it,\" the 32-year-old said. \"A free kick taker is already born with that gift; and during training, he perfects it. It's a gift that you don't achieve overnight.\"\n\nWatching Sport's youth team players carefully as he speaks, Wendel says that Brazilian players practise many different kinds of free kicks in order to master the dead ball. \"From distance, you need to hit more with the top of your foot and with more power. From up close to the goalie, you'd need to hit more with the inside of the foot,\" he added, pointing to his instep.\n\nHe blames the lack of goals from free kicks at the World Cup on the retirement of some of the foremost Brazilian exponents of the art. \"If Juninho was at the World Cup and we had him to hit every free kick, we'd have five or six goals from them,\" Wendel said with a smile. \"There have been some close calls, like Pirlo's against England that hit the crossbar. That was a perfect example of a well-executed free kick, since the ball changed direction. These are the most dangerous - the goalie will go one way and at the last second the ball changes direction.\" Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

The next day, Thailand's broadcasting regulator forked out more than 427 million baht to the rights-holder to ensure that all 64 Fifa World Cup football games would be televised \"live\" on free-to-air channels.\n\nThe military has also, among other initiatives, lowered diesel prices, asked producers of basic goods to freeze their prices, and provided handouts to the tourism industry.\n\nAdmittedly, these policies have helped improve the Kingdom's economic outlook since the coup, but whether the measures will succeed in the long run is still debatable. While local consumption will inevitably go up once you put more money in the hands of the people, there are limits to that growth because of Thailand's high level of household debt - which was above 82 per cent of gross domestic product at the end of last year.\n\nNaturally, critics of the military argue that taking the populist route is being fiscally irresponsible. Some economists have warned that spending vast amounts of taxpayer funds on buying popularity will only increase the financial burden on the shoulders of the next government, whenever one is eventually formed. Gen Prayuth had said last week that an interim government would be in place by this August, although a general election might take as long as a year.\n\nThe military should not assume that Thais will be happy so long as they receive a constant stream of goodies. During the protests, many people indicated that they would like to have a much greater say in how their country is run; the desire for democracy is still strong.\n\nGen Prayuth has much to do in trying to win over a large section of Thais - including the millions in the north and north-east provinces who are still smarting from Ms Yingluck's ouster - to get them to support his plans to establish a new constitution and political system. Taking the populist route to win the trust of the people may work for a few months, but the much harder task will be to unite a society that remains highly polarised.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The remaining hotel rooms will feature art from Singapore and other countries including Korea, Taiwan, Japan and the Philippines.\n\nMs Lim, 63, says: \"Russia, as we all know, has a long and important history of arts and culture. Its artists combine intellect, technical skills and emotions to produce their art . . . When we saw more than 15 Eastern European works, priced between $6,000 and $18,000, snapped up at the last fair, we realised that this was the direction we want to take for this edition.\"\n\nFor the opening night on July 18, visitors will be treated to classical Russian music played on the piano by mother-daughter team Iryna and Kfeniia Vokhmyanina, accompanied by soprano Anna Ivanenko belting Russian romances - a type of Russian music popular in early 1900s.\n\nRussian canapes and champagne will be provided by Buyan, the Russian restaurant and caviar bar on Duxton Hill. And Russian artist Tatiana Lysak-Polischyk, who has painted the portraits of her country's celebrities, will be on hand to sketch your portrait.\n\nStarted in January last year, Art Apart is Singapore's first and only hotel art fair, modelled after a popular concept that originated in New York in the 1990s. The organiser typically books an entire floor of rooms in a hotel for a period of time and leases them out to galleries.\n\nHundreds of artworks for sale are then displayed on the walls, beds, tables and even toilets. For foreign gallerists on a budget, the rooms double as a place to sleep at night - an advantage ordinary art fairs don't offer. Since Art Apart's debut, two other organisers have attempted to start their own hotel fairs - but both failed to take off.\n\nArt Apart has received criticism for featuring less established artists compared to premier art fairs, and for attracting a lower footfall. Its 3,500 visitorship number is much smaller than Art Stage's 45,700 and Affordable Art Fair's 13,300 in their last respective fairs.\n\nBut Ms Lim and her team have taken it on the chin and soldiered on. And from Oct 16 to 19, Art Apart will debut its London edition at Singapore hotelier Loh Lik Peng's Town Hall Hotel in Bethnal Green in London. It plans to show more than 1,500 artworks in approximately three dozen rooms at Mr Loh's 95-room boutique hotel. The dates are timed to coincide with London's biggest art fair, Frieze.\n\nMs Lim says: \"An art fair takes time to gain traction, increase visitorship and strengthen its gallery credentials. So while the criticisms made about us in the past were certainly legitimate, we're taking it in our stride.\"\n\nThe galleries taking part in the fair here next month include Singapore's Utterly Art and Barnadas Huang Gallery, Craft 21 from Korea and Berlin- based Russian gallery Gaze.\n\nGallery 11.12, a Moscow gallery with a branch here on Armenian Street, will also be taking part in the fair for the first time. Founder Elvira Sharova says: \"Gallery 11.12 has been operating in Singapore since 2012. We're quite familiar with the tastes of the buyers here, so we'll be bringing works we think the Singapore audience will enjoy very much.\"\n\nhelmi@sph.com.sg\n\n@HelmiBT\n\nArt Apart Fair (Singapore) will take place at the Parkroyal on Pickering hotel, 3 Upper Pickering Street, from July 18 to 20 from 11.30am to 9pm daily. Tickets at $10 can be purchased at the door.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They are looking for an \"integrated channel experience\". This means a client should be able to start an activity on one channel, like on the phone or in a face-to-face meeting, and finish it on another channel, like email, website, mobile apps, social media or videos.\n\nIn addition, there is a growing importance of digital services that cuts across all wealth levels. Those aged below 40 are especially likely to view digital services as important.\n\n\"The younger high net worth individuals (HNWIs) made their own fortune through digital means themselves, so they would expect from wealth management firms the same 24/7 access they are giving to their own clients,\" said Claire Sauvanaud, vice-president and senior account executive for Capgemini Asia Pacific.\n\nStefan Mueller, managing director and head of investments and products at the Royal Bank of Canada's (RBC) wealth management business in Asia, said that the industry faces a \"make or break\" situation.\n\n\"The winners make it convenient to share knowledge and interact with clients,\" he said.\n\nRBC Wealth Management and Capgemini Financial Services released World Wealth Report 2014 yesterday, a comprehensive look at the world's HNWIs - those with investable assets of more than US$1 million, excluding their primary residence. More than 4,500 HNWIs across 23 major markets were interviewed for the report.\n\nThe report found that nearly two-thirds of HNWIs expect to manage most or all of their wealth relationships digitally in five years' time. The same proportion would consider leaving their current firm if they cannot get an integrated wealth management experience across different channels.\n\nIn Latin America and the Asia-Pacific excluding Japan, over 80 per cent of HNWIs said that they will consider moving to another firm if this kind of integrated experience is not provided. This compares to around 60 per cent in Europe and North America.\n\n\"Social media and video tools are important notably in Asia. In Asia you have two very concentrated financial centres, Hong Kong and Singapore, yet HNWIs are spread across the whole region,\" said Mrs Sauvanaud.\n\nHNWIs want digital capabilities to keep them informed and to enable transactions, the report said. Where engaging the firm for advice is concerned, however, they prefer being there in person and through the phone.\n\nWealth managers have been investing heavily in the digital space from last year. Early this year, DBS Bank said that it will invest $15 million over three years in Watson, a cloud-based service of tech giant IBM that can process large amounts of information. The bank plans to use Watson to help its relationship managers recommend products to clients.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Still, there's something annoying about a movie that is a little too smug about its self-mocking tone.\n\nThe odd-couple cop pairing - Schmidt is nerdy and socially inept while Jenko is a jock who seriously lacks brain power - is something that audiences never seem to tire of (see Exhibit A: the Lethal Weapon series) but 22 Jump Street takes it to another level (and I don't just mean going from high school to college).\n\nThese guys are the most unlikely-looking students since Bluto in Animal House (1978) but, of course, there's no age limit when it comes to juvenile male behaviour: Schmidt and Jenko simply shrug off their ridiculously age-inappropriate presence on campus and move along to the next wink-wink scene, typically surrounded by hordes of bikini-clad babes.\n\nThe storyline in the first film called for the pair to bust the supplier of a synthetic drug. This time, after failing to capture a dealer named Ghost (Peter Stormare), they find themselves back in school posing as university students, sent by Jump Street team boss Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) to seek out the dealer who supplied a killer drug to one of the students.\n\nThe flimsy plot takes a jab at just about every clich\u00e9 known to American college culture. Along the way, the relationship between Schmidt and Jenko shifts from the bromance-driven dynamic in the original movie to a possible break-up, thanks to third-party interference. Jenko connects on and off the field with the school's star quarterback Zook (Wyatt Russell), and they soon become the new power couple on campus and hurting Schmidt's feelings in the process.\n\nSchmidt pouts but also spends time impressing attractive art student Maya (Amber Stevens) with his poetry-slamming prowess and getting cosy in her dorm room.\n\nMaya's roommate Mercedes (Jillian Bell) is a reluctant witness to their romantic encounters and her deadpan dissing of Schmidt accounts for some of the film's funnier moments - along with the hilarious end credits sequence where an endless variety of Jump Street sequels is presented.\n\nDirected by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller - a filmmaking power couple in their own right in both animated (Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, The Lego Movie) and live-action comedy genres - 22 Jump Street presses just about every parody button you can imagine. The results are funny at times and tedious at others.\n\nStill, this movie will appeal to the audience that matters most: males in the 18-to-25-year-old bracket - and all the other bros who act like they still belong there.\n\nRating:\n\nC+\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Debbie Yong looks at a coffeeshop in Bukit Merah that's defying convention\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 20, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIMMANUEL Tee never saw himself working in a coffeeshop.\n\nTo most young chefs in Singapore, the 27-year-old chef's resume is the stuff of envy. He got his culinary diploma from At-Sunrice, spent several years working for Andre Chiang at Jaan and Restaurant Andre and now-defunct Guy Savoy in the Marina Bay Sands before clinching a stage at two Michelin-star Pastorale in Belgium.\n\nAt just 25, he was promoted to the head chef position at modernist restaurant Keystone in the heart of the Central Business District. But it all came to a sudden halt last year when Keystone shuttered for good following a rental hike. Mr Tee was left jobless.\n\nHe scoured the market for investors to start his own restaurant, but when talks with potential partners didn't pan out and he couldn't cough up the more than $300,000 typically needed to fund a restaurant, he dug into his savings to go it alone in the most unlikely of places - a Bukit Merah coffeeshop.\n\nBut it wasn't just any old coffeeshop. Call it Kopitiam version 2.0 if you will: all of the 170-seater's tables are covered with blue and white chequered tablecloths. In place of traditional hawker fare, stalls dish out German pork knuckles, French beef bourguignon and grilled Cajun prawns that are more commonly seen on restaurant menus. You can wash them down with craft beers instead of the usual Tiger or Heineken, and the best part? Nothing costs over $20.\n\nThe coffeeshop even has a name: Salut, which is French for \"hi\" but also intended as \"a salute to the customers for giving us a chance and the tenants for coming up with such original, tasty food,\" says Chua Kiat Tat, who runs the coffeeshop on behalf of his father. His family acquired the entire space two years ago after nine other landlords before them had failed to make it profitable, he says.\n\n\"We're surrounded by so many coffeeshops with famous stalls in them, so we were forced by circumstances to differentiate ourselves,\" he says of the decision to position the coffeeshop as a low-cost startup platform for local food entrepreneurs. Rents vary according to stall size, but average $4,000 per month. \"By keeping rents low, tenants won't have to stinge on the quality of their ingredients so we can bring restaurant-standard food to customers at an affordable rate. It's a win-win for diners, tenants and us as coffeeshop operators.\"\n\nVibrant synergy\n\nMr Chua's family runs German stall Stew Kuche, and the other six units are tenanted out to a seafood stall, a dessert shop, a healthy juice stall and the latest three additions, noodle stall Mian, fried chicken specialists Two Wings and Mr Tee's Immanuel French Kitchen.\n\nAdditional conveniences such as a centralised payment system and joint events such as an Oktoberfest buffet are still being worked out. The long-term goal is to grow with existing tenants to duplicate the set-up in other coffeeshops around Singapore, hopefully as early as next year, says Mr Chua. For Mian's Karen Cheng, the good tenant mix and vibrant synergy among them was what attracted her to the space when scouring for a brick-and-mortar base for her food truck, The Travelling Cow.\n\nTwo Wings' Jeremy Loh originally eyed a stall at a neighbouring coffeeshop, but an unplanned meal at Salut convinced him to sign up on the spot. \"It was packed with young people who looked like they didn't mind spending more, it was like nowhere else I'd been to,\" says Mr Loh.\n\nBut for a concept like this to work, careful management is needed, he reckons. \"There must be no competition between stalls,\" he says, adding that he considered - but was dissuaded from - selling fried fish fingers items to avoid cannibalising neighbouring seafood stall Seasalt's business, for instance.\n\nIt wouldn't work in any neighbourhood either, say tenants. The Bukit Merah venue works because of its proximity to office towers and high-density condominiums in the area. Western and Asian expatriates fill the space at lunch, while families heading to nearby Ikea and Queensway Shopping Centre stream in on weekends. Tenants are also banking on the under-construction Park Hotel Alexandra just a few paces away to bring in more traffic.\n\nThe sweaty hard slog aside, Mr Tee believes that a coffeeshop makes for a more conducive training ground for young chefs. \"In a restaurant, chefs can hide all day in the kitchen, but in a coffeeshop stall, you have to face your customers daily. You have to swallow your pride and take in their comments, good or bad.\"\n\nSays the soft-spoken, amicable young chef, who hopes to open further stalls under the Immanuel brand: \"It will always be my dream to be in fine dining, but it's tough to do it in Singapore. One has to be realistic.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Or that she received a Cultural Medallion for visual arts in 1982?\n\nA new three-part documentary titled The Worlds of Georgette Chen will delve deep into her life and be broadcast in April next year.\n\nThis docudrama is commissioned by the National Gallery Singapore, and produced by Channel NewsAsia.\n\nChong Siak Ching, chief executive officer of National Gallery Singapore, says the idea came about when the gallery noticed a lack of available materials on local pioneer artists such as Georgette Chen - which it felt would be worth highlighting to the public.\n\nShe says: \"Georgette Chen was an extraordinary woman who lived through extraordinary times, and we believe her life would inspire many people - from young Singaporeans who do not know of her to our pioneer generation who may have experienced the Singapore that she eventually found her home in.\"\n\nSince the artist's works will be displayed at the DBS Singapore Gallery at the National Gallery when it opens next year, it seemed appropriate to make the docudrama.\n\nThe Worlds of Georgette Chen will be set in three different periods: the French period from 1927 to 1933; the Chinese/Hong Kong period from 1934 to 1948; and the Penang/Singapore period from 1950 to 1980.\n\nSays Channel NewsAsia managing director Debra Soon: \"Georgette's life story is a rich tale of passion for art, set against the backdrop of tumultuous world events and a uniquely cosmopolitan lifestyle of a rich and powerful ethnic Chinese family. The story is more than just the artist herself, but a revelation of the social milieu that she lived in at the time.\"\n\nAccording to Ms Soon, research for the show started earlier this year, when her staff gathered archival materials like letters written by and to the artist, and interviewed Chen's close friends, students and relatives.\n\n\"There are high expectations, and we have only a year to complete this,\" she says. \"There will be production timeline pressures but, more importantly, our own pressure - of ensuring the integrity of the story, keeping it accurate, entertaining and inspiring, which will be key to the success of the series.\"\n\nMaking this production has proven to be daunting. Ms Soon points out that not all of the artist's life has been properly documented, and many of the people whom she knew personally have either passed on or declined to participate.\n\nThis makes it a little tougher for local actress Rui En, who will be portraying the artist in the docudrama, because every piece of documentation is crucial to help her get into the mind of the artist.\n\n\"There are no surviving interviews or footage of her speaking on camera. In other words, there may still be a certain level of imagination required to flesh this character out. Understanding her history and background has been instrumental to comprehending her,\" she says.\n\nUltimately, that's the main aim of this docudrama: to introduce this artist to more Singaporeans and make her more relatable via a modern and mainstream platform.\n\nSays Ms Soon: \"Georgette was an extremely cultured and talented artist . . . she bloomed beautifully despite living through the ravages of war, a bad marriage and the pain of her lifelong arthritis. Although she was born with a silver spoon in her mouth, she was respected for her humility and diligence. She's a truly remarkable, inspiring role model for the women of today.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

She has seeded and sodded estates for the likes of David Geffen, Stavros Niarchos and Rupert Murdoch, and her haute habitats dot townhouse backyards and pre-war rooftops from Greenwich Village to Park Avenue.\n\nFor her latest project, she is turning what would otherwise be a barren air shaft inside a new Tribeca loft building, the Sterling Mason, into a lush 1,000-square-foot courtyard. Hawthorn trees telegraph the seasons, from rich white blossoms to lush green leaves, red berries and spindly branches. Ivy creeps along the ground, framing a sculptural stream.\n\n\"It should be a remarkably peaceful space,\" said Dan McInerney, a vice-president for Taconic Investment Partners, which is building the 32-unit Sterling Mason.\n\nTo keep that peace, this most inviting oasis will be off-limits, and not just to the general public. Even residents of the building, where apartments are going for up to US$23 million, will be allowed to enjoy it only from the ground floor lobby and library or their bedroom windows upstairs.\n\nIn the concrete jungle, one of the rarest amenities is actual foliage. In-building laundry, even yoga rooms and bike storage, are more common than a lawn, let alone one designed by one of the premier horticulturalists in the business. But at a growing number of upmarket buildings, the ultimate luxury offering is a miniature Gramercy Park, one so exclusive that no one but the gardener gets a key.\n\nNo need to stop and smell the roses, developers and designers say.\n\n\"Just catching a glimpse of greenery in the city can bring a sense of calm,\" Ms Nevins said. \"I never have time to go to Central Park, but just walking out my door on 73rd Street and seeing it there makes all the difference.\"\n\nThe Schumacher, a historic watch factory on Bleecker Street in Nolita that is being converted, had an original light well from 1883, when natural light was the only way to do the intricate manufacturing. With 21 condos for US$4 million to US$25 million, buyers could hardly be expected to look out onto an empty concrete shaft, like the denizens of some nearby tenement. Worse yet would be if it became a party venue.\n\n\"This is a serene space - the last thing we want is barbecue and cigarette smoke,\" said Rory Stillman, president of Stillman Development, the building's developer.\n\nMr Stillman hired the renowned landscape designer Ken Smith. \"We didn't want big trees, because it would block too much light, but we still wanted to create a sense of privacy,\" Mr Stillman said. \"We decided to bring the Hanging Gardens of Babylon to Manhattan.\"\n\nIvy covers the walls - inspired by a stay Mr Stillman had at the Hotel Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e in Paris - and climbs along cables stretching from a base of crushed marble up to the roof six storeys above, looking like alien tendrils. Further complementing the space will be a pair of sculptures by Jeff Koons belonging to the collector Alberto Mugrabi. He bought a pair of triplex units for US$20.7 million and was so taken by the garden he wanted to contribute to it.\n\nThe newer residential gardens are largely an outgrowth of the current, post-bubble market, where financing has been scarce, leading to smaller boutique projects with larger units aimed at the wealthy. When apartments stop being cramped, there is less need to leave it for a get-together on the terrace or courtyard. Plus, if the owner wants to escape to nature, odds are good they already have a retreat or two somewhere.\n\n\"Even if you have a place out east, upstate, the Riviera, a yacht, it's still nice to wake up in nature,\" Mr Stillman said.\n\nTechnology has also advanced to the point where these spaces require almost no maintenance, especially if they are off-limits, which eliminates the need for shovelling and raking - seasonal pruning will do. Ample sunshine can be a problem, though, as well as layout.\n\n\"You're designing on two planes, for people in the lobby and the common areas looking out on the garden, but also from above,\" Mr Smith said.\n\nSK Development is tilling two look-but-don't-touch gardens. Where others are manicured, the Reade Chambers in Tribeca has one as wild looking as the High Line. At 10 Bond St in NoHo, a sunken light well for the gym and retail space was turned into an oversize vitrine planted with a single 18-foot Saucer magnolia tree to enliven the space. \"We wanted to make the basement more than a basement,\" said Scott Shnay, the principal of SK Development.\n\nWhile still uncommon in the city, this latest crop of gardens is a bit of a throwback, to an earlier gilded era. Grand turn-of-the-century apartment buildings such as the Apthorp, the Dakota and Riverhouse all featured small, inaccessible gardens within their entrance courtyards.\n\nSince this golden age, most installations have been corporate ones, such as Isamu Noguchi's Zen garden at Chase Manhattan Plaza downtown and a stand of birch trees at The New York Times building, though the goal is the same - a pleasant view and lots of light. The current apartment appellation owes a debt as well to the Museum of Modern Art, where Mr Smith, the Schumacher designer, created a massive installation of plastic plants and fake rocks on the museum's roof after its 2003 expansion. It is meant to enhance the view from residences in neighbouring buildings.\n\nEven as New Yorkers are getting back to nature at urban farms, waterfront parks and green roofs, apartments boasting these Edenic refuges and their forbidden fruit may actually be the truest expression of gardening.\n\n\"It really is a garden in the most traditional sense,\" which is a simulation of nature, said Denise Hoffman-Brandt, director of the landscape architecture programme at City College. \"It's all about the artifice.\" - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

Executives who don't want to work out with the rank-and-file will have access to a private gym suite.\n\nOther changes to the art deco landmark are also meant to appeal to a high-end market. Empire State Realty Trust, which owns and operates the building, is also adding a conference centre on the 67th floor and a 100-seat white-tablecloth restaurant on the lobby level, with private dining below. The restaurant, State Bar & Grill, wants to cater to a business clientele, rather than the millions of tourists who visit the observatory every year (about 4.3 million in 2013).\n\n\"Whatever your work hours are, you can come in, get your coffee at Starbucks, go to your modern, efficient work space and break for a workout,\" said Thomas P Durels, chief of property operations and leasing for Empire State Realty Trust, which became a listed company last year.\n\nThe recent improvements tap into a trend in office design to create a more inviting work environment. Technology companies in particular have gained a reputation for providing enticing amenities such as free meals, yoga and Foosball. The philosophy is to give workers another incentive to stay longer. Detractors contend that installing a gym would not necessarily improve workers' happiness, particularly in a neighbourhood where gyms are plentiful.\n\nRestaurants serving the health-conscious and chic bars pouring after-work drinks remain sparse in this part of midtown Manhattan. Although the Empire State Building has a Starbucks, a Chipotle, a Heartland Brewery, a deli and an AT&T store, workers expressed disappointment that one of the largest office buildings in the world doesn't offer sufficient retailing for the people who work in it. The new restaurant is intended to help address that concern.\n\nThe building has long struggled with its identity. The iconic tower might be the most recognisable on the New York City skyline, but for decades its offices didn't share in the glory. When the tower opened in 1931, during the Great Depression, it failed to attract enough tenants (the 2.6 million-square-foot building earned an unfortunate nickname, the Empty State Building).\n\nFor decades, a hodgepodge of nondescript tenants leased tiny spaces. Vast floors were subdivided into small, dreary offices with drop ceilings, shag carpeting and fluorescent lighting.\n\nSo in 2006, Malkin Holdings, the company handling day-to-day operations at the time, began a US$550 million modernisation endeavor to restore the marble lobby and reproduce the damaged mural on the ceiling, gut vacant floors, upgrade the building's technology and overhaul the mechanical systems. The new amenities are the latest stage of the project, which includes updating the 68 passenger lifts.\n\n\"The Empire State Building is a brand that's been abused, but it's a brand,\" said Anthony E Malkin, chief executive of Empire State Realty Trust. \"What is the brand of the Empire State Building? Back in 2006, my answer was: We're going to make it hot, we're going to make it hip.\"\n\nDozens of small tenants have been replaced with a few big names with stylish, modern offices, like the social networking site LinkedIn. In April, the international fragrance manufacturer Coty expanded to five floors. The stock photography company Shutterstock moved into two floors in January, paying in the mid-US$50s per square foot, according to Paul Ippolito, the broker for Newmark Grubb Knight Frank who represented Shutterstock.\n\n\"In the past few years, it's really turned a corner,\" said John Tauranac, author of \"The Empire State Building: The Making of a Landmark.\"\n\nRents have soared. In 2006, the average rent was US$26.50 a square foot. Today, asking rent ranges from the mid-US$50s to the low-US$60s per square foot, according to Durels.\n\nBy comparison, the average asking rent for office space in Midtown South was US$56.31 in the first quarter of the year, according to a report by Newmark Grubb Knight Frank.\n\nShutterstock's new space is an airy, open office with exposed beams, hanging Edison bulbs and two outdoor terraces. A wide internal staircase leads employees from the 21st floor down to the 20th, which has a cafeteria, yoga studio, library and game room (a second game room on the 21st floor has an Alice in Wonderland theme).\n\n\"It's a beautiful building,\" said Tracy J Kim, a vice-president for human resources at Shutterstock. \"It's a great location.\"\n\nDoormen clad in burgundy uniforms that match the marble greet every person who enters the building. Signs direct tourists to the Fifth Avenue entrance, leaving the 33rd and 34th street lobbies exclusively for office workers.\n\n\"The last thing an office worker wants to see is a dad in a tank top with three screaming children,\" said Mr Malkin, whose grandfather, Lawrence A Wien, bought the Empire State Building in 1961 with Harry Helmsley.\n\nDespite the investment, a dowdy reputation can be hard to shed, and some prospective tenants are reluctant to visit the building for a tour. Even some current employees perceive it as an unappealing tourist magnet.\n\n\"It's not in the Fashion District and it's not cool downtown,\" said Sarah Levine, who works in the building as a senior technical designer at Li & Fung, the consumer goods giant.\n\nSome tenants are welcoming the changes. Jacques Catafago, a lawyer, began leasing space in 1990. He pays US$32 a square foot for a 4,900-square-foot space on the 48th floor. But his rent will soon rise to about US$52 a square foot.\n\nGiven the building improvements, Mr Catafago didn't balk at the new bill. Instead, he is looking forward to the gym. \"I'll lose 20 pounds (9kg),\" he predicted. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

Without any safety harness, these Colombian acrobats jump, sprint and even skip rope as the wheels go faster and faster.\n\nWithout spoiling the surprise of the rest of this quite amazing Wheel of Death segment that is the grand finale of the circus spectacle Le Noir, let's just say it's likely to leave the audience squirming on the edge of their seats as they fear for the performers' lives.\n\nSee it for yourself since the show is back in Singapore at the Mastercard Theatres at Marina Bay Sands (MBS), the same venue where it entertained more than 18,000 people for nearly a month last year.\n\nIf you caught Le Noir during its inaugural run, you might notice that the majority of the acts this time around are similar, although some boast new performers with new moves and tricks in their repertoire.\n\nAmong the 20-strong cast are contortionists, dancers, musicians and a comedian, many of whom used to work for Cirque du Soleil.\n\nThe best thing: there's not a bad seat in the house when it comes to this show because Base Entertainment Asia (the company responsible for bringing Le Noir back to these shores) has once again transformed the theatre at MBS into a circus-like arena.\n\nThere's a custom-built circular stage where spectators get to enjoy a full 360-degree view of the action as it unfolds right before them.\n\nThere isn't much of a storyline during the two-hour show, but the performances are unique and visually stunning in their own way to keep the audience sufficiently engrossed.\n\nAlso, it's not just the \"death-defying\" acts that are worth catching - our favourite was a \"fairly simple\" one where a guy with a mohawk spins a large metal frame in the air with remarkable ease.\n\nAnd, like most circus shows, those in the front rows might get more than what they paid for when they are asked to take part in a trick or two. (Ladies: beware a smooth-talking Frenchman who is seeking a date for a romantic picnic and won't take \"no\" for an answer.)\n\nThe clever use of colourful strobe lights and fast-paced music help add to the intensity of Le Noir. Seeing is truly believing, in this case.\n\nLe Noir - The Intimate Side of Cirque is running at MasterCard Theatres, Marina Bay Sands, at 7.30pm on Tuesdays to Fridays; 3pm and 7.30pm on Saturdays; 1pm and 5.30pm on Sundays, until June 29.

And collectors have been quick to snap up the works priced from $3,400 to $4,800.\n\nIndeed, three paintings were bought by The Watch Fund co-founder Dominic Khoo alone, who says: \"The paintings make you stop and look at them carefully. They remind me of the kind of photographs I used to take myself, the kind that rewards slow looking.\"\n\nFor this exhibition titled Dusk to Dawn, Hilmi used numerous photographic images of Singapore taken from the 1950s and 1960s as starting points. These were complemented with stills from P Ramlee films, which he grew up watching.\n\nHilmi juxtaposes the images and paints them in a diaphonous, scumbled way so the images appear soft and half-faded, as if they are set to vanish into thin air. The resulting images are arresting, enigmatic and tinged with elusive memories.\n\nHilmi, 27, says he is obsessed with the black-and-white cinema of yore, especially classic films by directors Yasujiro Ozu, Alfred Hitchcock and Ramlee. \"I'm always looking back into the past to make sense of the present. It's as if there's a mystery to be unlocked and uncovered - and the only way to do it is to examine the images of the past,\" he says.\n\nOne of his stronger works, titled The Waltz, splits the canvas into two parts. On the right are three men wearing sarongs and sitting cross-legged on the floor (a scene taken from Ramlee's Bujang Lapok comedy) with a rural background behind them. On the left are four modern-dressed women seated at a table, with a dancehall in the background.\n\n\"I specifically wanted to use images of the 1950s and 1960s because this was the decade of rapid modernisation and transformation. Many of the images show the transition of Singaporeans from living in kampongs to high-rise buildings, from wearing traditional Asian clothing to so-called modern Western dress.\"\n\nAnother notable work is City Dwellers, which depicts a partial Stamford Raffles statue, a group of girls studying Chua Mia Tee's iconic 1950 painting National Language Class and random crowds against the background of low-rise flats.\n\n\"Everything changed so much, so quickly, for Singapore during those two decades. Blink and your environment is gone. In a way, these images represent the rapid changes of Singapore throughout all the decades,\" he says.\n\nDusk to Dawn, presented by OCBC and Galerie Steph, is on until June 27 at the OCBC Art Space at the lobby of OCBC Centre Branch, 65 Chulia Street.

From his intimate and Buddhist philosophy-infused view of the Peranakan table, Tung has switched his gaze and trained his brush on the lines and life of Chinatown. From the soft colours of nyonya-ware, he's now gone monochromatic in Silence, the title of this exhibition of some 30 ink-on-rice-paper paintings featuring Chinatown and Singapore River.\n\n\"There comes a time when artists need to take a break and step away,\" he says of his long hiatus, when he travelled extensively in South-east Asia for the last eight years. \"I also took up photography because I bought a digital camera, so I wanted to develop and spend time with this new medium, and discover more of myself,\" elaborates the 55-year-old.\n\nThe first place he visited when he embarked on his new hobby was Angkor Wat, where he joined a photographic group. He extended his visit after the eight-day trip, and stayed on in a village.\n\nSince then, his method of travel was to immerse himself in the local community and experience the pace of life and culture in countries like Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand. \"I took about three million photos in the last five years!\" he enthuses.\n\nHe would spend just under a month in a country simply because that's how long Singaporeans can stay without a visa. \"And I'd stay in the same village, living simply with the people and trying to understand their way of life. If you stay longer, that's when they involve you more in their lives,\" he adds.\n\nBesides documenting their lives and collecting material for future work, Tung also took pictures for them. \"I realised that these villagers didn't have photographs of themselves. To get a photo taken, they'd have to go all the way to town to get a studio shot, whereas I could do it easily for them.\"\n\n\"At first I thought I liked to shoot scenery, but I realised that I preferred photographing people, and it made it easier as well to communicate and interact with them.\"\n\nWhen he finally returned to painting in Singapore, he found a fresh wave of inspiration from Chinatown - which he first painted 12 years ago.\n\n\"While that series was done in colour, my current one is in black and white. I feel that the single colour cuts out the unnecessary distractions from the painting.\"\n\nHe has some childhood memories of Chinatown, coupled with impressions of the place from his parents - first-generation immigrants from China - and memories of visits to his godmother who lived in the area.\n\n\"It's not where I grew up but I've bits and pieces of it in my mind, and now, with new immigrants from China, there are other different layers of scenes overlapping one another in my mind,\" he elaborates.\n\nFor the past two years, Tung painted on site, from 7am until the afternoon or evening - spending four and up to 12 hours a day soaking in the atmosphere and making a point to observe the changes in the day.\n\n\"I had to go there in the early morning because in some locations, once businesses started operating, I couldn't sit in front of their stores to paint. But I liked staying there for long periods - sometimes starting at 5am - to absorb the mood,\" he says.\n\nIn painting Chinatown, Tung joins a long list of artists who've tackled the subject. \"What I've done is not to just focus on the architecture but to distil my own feelings about Chinatown and the blend of old and the new, and try to convey that in my paintings,\" he adds.\n\nThat explains the (incongruous) title, Silence, for drawings that capture the hustle and bustle of Chinatown. Tung would not rush to finish a painting, taking as long he liked to just get a sense of the scene. \"Sometimes even in four hours, you're just scratching the surface. Painting to me is almost like meditation - I try to concentrate until things slow down around me, and I find the real meaning of what I'm trying to paint,\" he adds.\n\nTung was 17 when he started taking lessons from his sifu - Shi Xang Tuo and Ng Eng Teng - in a variety of Chinese artistic mediums, ranging from calligraphy, Chinese painting, engraving, ceramics and sculpture. He was a graphic designer until he became a full-time artist.\n\nIt's interesting that his latest series is based on something so close to home rather than on his travels in South-east Asia over the years - he talks fondly of the simple pleasures of life, of being with nature and joining the children playing in the river and sharing from one portion of rice.\n\nSpending so much time painting the scenes of Chinatown, he became a familiar face there, he says. \"There'd be an uncle who'd offer me coffee, and one time I paid for an old lady's drink when we were having lunch at the same table. The next day, she bought me a drink in return. So it's through these interactions that I slowly eased back into life in Singapore,\" he shares.\n\nSure, life is fast in Singapore but one can still find that peaceful spot in its midst. Now, it's up to art aficionados to see if they can discern the painter's inner core through his work - which is what Tung strived to capture through his rendering of Singapore's iconic locations.\n\nSilence, which will be shown at Cape of Good Hope Art Gallery, features 97cm x 97cm pieces priced at $10,000 each. The exhibition is from June 21 until 30. The gallery at the Old Hill Street Police Station, 140 Hill Street #01-06, is open from 11am to 7pm daily. Tel: (65) 6733 3822.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/are-shorter-industrial-leases-problem", "site_title": "Are shorter industrial leases a problem?", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nAre shorter industrial leases a problem?\n\nHard to obtain loans and resell, but it ousts speculators\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Jun 19, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] The government's move to shorten industrial land tenures to help industrialists better manage costs is all well and good. Going by simple comparisons, it has even worked. Land prices have indeed fallen for plots rolled out from July 2012 whose leases have been halved to 20-30 years, from a maximum of 60 years previously.\n\nLet's take two examples of plots situated close to each other that were sold before and after the 30-year lease cap was implemented. In March 2011, an Ubi Ave 4 site with a 60-year lease attracted the highest tender of $72.2 million, or $2,333 per square metre per plot ratio (psm ppr). Two years later, another site in the vicinity sold for $16.2 million, or $1,851 psm ppr. That's a 21 per cent price drop. Both sites were zoned Business-1.\n\nAnother example: a 58-year lease Serangoon North Ave 4 industrial site received a winning bid of $47.1 million, or $2,332 psm ppr, in March last year. Eight months after that, a nearby site at Ave 5 sold for $27 million, or $1,439 psm ppr - a stunning 38 per cent price drop.\n\nThe available like-for-like comparables are few and far between and thus are not conclusive, but the signs are pointing to the effectiveness of shorter tenures in reducing land prices. Not exactly in half in tandem with the tenures, however, since land values decline in a curve, not linearly, to their tenures. By analysts' calculations, cutting a lease from 60 to 30 years should theoretically lower its value by 25 per cent.\n\nAnd yet, like squeezing a five-year university education into three, everything just becomes more intense over the shorter duration.\n\nIf we were to divide the quantum over the tenure to obtain the cost per year, purchase and construction costs, spread over a shorter period, would have risen instead. For the Ubi sites, the land prices would have jumped from $39 to $62 psm ppr per year, while the costs of the Serangoon North sites would have risen from $40 to $48 psm ppr per year.\n\nSpreading the loan over a shorter tenure also results in higher monthly mortgages, which can reduce the company's liquidity and cash flow, said Mervyn Koh, head of Business Banking, Singapore, UOB Group. Some banks, such as DBS, require a lease period of at least 10 years at the end of the term loan, further shrinking the repayment period.\n\nAlan Cheong, Savills Singapore research head, said: \"Leverage plays an important role in the determination of asset values. . . Shorter tenures do not reduce the cash outlay of an end user who has a mortgage on the asset, because the loan tenure will correspondingly be shortened to account for the shorter lease. This can negate the price decline.\" The shorter tenures also make reselling the property more difficult. If the first owner already struggles to obtain financing for the purchase, imagine the hurdle a second buyer would face. Besides, not much demand exists for a property with a mere few years of the lease remaining in the resale market.\n\nThe shorter tenures also mean that the property's asset value will depreciate very quickly (in quantum terms per year). A 20-year lease site, after three years of construction and five years of minimum occupation, will have only 12 years left on its lease - not very much time for an investor to recoup his investment. But these shortcomings of shorter-tenure properties may precisely be what the government is aiming for: to make industrial property unattractive to speculators and investors so as to weed them out from the buyer pool.\n\nInterest was diverted to this segment, especially for strata-titled industrial properties, from the residential sector after supply glut risks and government interventions started weighing down on the latter from 2011. The appeal of the industrial property segment was sweetened by its high rental yields and lower capital required.\n\nR'ST Research director Ong Kah Seng said: \"The main purpose of the government's slashing of leases is to clarify that industrial land is not for speculation. The government is hoping to dim their investment potential by reducing their long-term returns. Ousting specu-vestors will help keep prices and rents of industrial space more stable, with less mom-and-pop entry and more genuine ownership.\"\n\nAnd the government has been very consistent in its stance with every cooling measure it has introduced.\n\nThe upshot for industrialists is that it will become increasingly easier for them to buy and own their own property for more stability in business costs, free from market fluctuations and landlords' rental hikes.\n\nThe property becomes less an asset for paper gain, and more a long-term rental guarantee.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the midst of heads and limbs lying about waiting to be soldered together, two giant apples are in the final stage of completion.\n\nDust of all kinds - metal, ceramic and fine sand - swirls in the air as work at the bronze foundry is in full swing. In a hot but windy afternoon, the workers assigned to artist Kumari Nahappan's apple sculptures are polishing and smoothening the surface (a process called \"chasing\"), filling up and welding tiny holes to create a flawless finish. Kumari - in face mask and gloves - is closely overseeing the work to make sure it's done correctly.\n\nEver so quietly, in her characteristically gentle style, Kumari is putting the pressure on the Thai workers of Asia Fine Art (AFA) as the deadline to deliver the apples draws nearer. \"They are very good in what they do, but this sculpture is also very different from the work they normally do, so I have to be here to supervise every step because it's more difficult and much more costly to correct something gone wrong,\" she explains. In two weeks, the monumental sculptures will be shipped from the foundry in Ayuthya, Thailand, to Singapore.\n\nThe giant apples will be gracing the entrance to the first five-star hotel in Farrer Park - One Farrer Hotel & Spa - and the adjoining Farrer Park Hospital, both of which are housed in a multi-use complex, Connexion.\n\nThe monumental sculptures are the very first art commission that One Farrer Park Company made, says Richard Helfer, member of the company's board and chairman of One Farrer Pte Ltd who is driving the company's art collection.\n\n\"We knew that we wanted to work with Kumari, but we left it to her to propose the idea,\" he explains. After months of discussion and thought, Kumari proposed the apples, which was a departure from her iconic tropical fruit such as peppers and nutmegs.\n\n\"In this case, I thought that there'd be much more acceptance for the apples - which I'd named Apollo and Artemis - given the nature of the buildings,\" she says.\n\nThe green \"apple of life\" was named after Artemis, the Greek goddess known for her affiliation for the wild and the pursuit of lifestyle, while the red apple is named after her twin, Apollo, who's the god of medicine and healing.\n\n\"I think the colours will be quite iconic because that's what people will remember as well, which helps makes that visual connection,\" says Dr Helfer.\n\nThe colour inspiration will come from Red Washington and Granny Smith apples. AFA's workers are experimenting with the shades now, using acid and fire to prepare the bronze surface before dabbing pigment on it so that the metal is able to hold the colour. The apples aren't going to be painted but given the right patina, which is an art in itself, explains Kumari.\n\nIt's not every day that she gets commissioned for her monumental sculptures, and in fact, Kumari can undertake only one or two such time-consuming projects like this in one year.\n\nHer giant peppers burst onto Singapore's sculpture scene about a decade ago, and since then, her iconic works have made a monumental mark on the landscape - there is the bronze chilli-pepper, Pedas Pedas (2006) commissioned by the National Museum of Singapore, while her giant Saga (2007) can be seen at Changi Airport and the Nutmeg (2009) outside ION Orchard. Pembungaan (2011) is another monumental bronze mural of over 45m in length at OUE Bayfront.\n\n\"I couldn't do more than two projects like this a year,\" she says, and a first-hand look at the arduous process of making bronze sculptures helps one understand why. Besides the lengthy process, the complexity is further scaled up with monumental sculptures.\n\nFor a small sculpture using the lost wax method, the artist makes the mould, after which a negative wax imprint is made of it. Then it has to be dipped in several layers of ceramic glue, then fine sand and coarse sand (to retain its structure) over the course of a few days to a week. When everything has dried fully, melted bronze is poured into the moulds, cooled, and then the ceramic structure around it is broken, after which the bronze object has to be treated and given its final finish. All this takes weeks, much more so when it's a new, one-off creation.\n\nFor Kumari's gigantic works, the sculpture is made in parts and then later soldered together. Because they're so large, the parts are put into a sand mould rather than a ceramic mould. \"And because it's made with a sand mould, the surface is much less perfect than when it's made with a ceramic mould,\" she explains.\n\nBut she's worked with this foundry since 2002 because of the high quality of the bronze it uses (it is imported from Australia) and its willingness to work on her pieces, she says, as well as the high standards maintained.\n\nThe foundry's main income is from the Buddhist statues and also statues of Thai kings, present and past. \"So you can understand that they are working out of the norm when they have to work on my sculptures,\" she notes.\n\nBut Kumari's works also perk up the workers' otherwise quite predictable routine, pushes the limit of their expertise, and her ideas are inspiring, says Thawan Muengchang, the owner of AFA, beaming at us as he pops by to chat. \"She really has unusual and good ideas . . . we like working with her,\" he adds in halting English. He has assigned a few staff who speak English well enough to work with Kumari.\n\nThe foundry also works with other artists. Sometimes, however, commissions can fall through - we were shown a huge sculpture, almost three meters tall, of a muscular man standing on top of a globe. Instead of piecing the almost-finished work together though, workers were taking it apart as the order was cancelled at the last minute.\n\nIt's heart-breaking to see all the man hours go down the drain, and even if the bronze can be melted down to be used again, its quality is compromised.\n\nAt least, though, there's the foundry's satisfaction of knowing that Kumari's sculptures will get to their final destination in Singapore - where they'll stand as a testimony to one artist's concept and a foundry's craftsmanship.\n\nuihoon@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

As expected, it announced that it would reduce its monthly bond purchases by US$10 billion to US$35 billion beginning next month, and that it still expects to stop expanding its holdings later this year.\n\n\"Growth in economic activity has rebounded in recent months,\" the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting of its policymaking committee. It said that labour markets, household spending and business investment all were improving.\n\nThe committee's decision was unanimous.\n\nIn predictions published on Wednesday, Fed officials estimated that the economy would expand 2.1 to 2.3 per cent this year, down from a March forecast for growth of 2.8 to 3 per cent. It is the seventh straight year that the Fed's initial optimism has been eroded by disappointing data.\n\nBut officials maintained relatively optimistic forecasts for 2015 and 2016, predicting growth next year would exceed 3 per cent for the first time since the recession.\n\nAt the same time, officials predicted that the unemployment rate would decline more quickly than they had expected in March, also part of a continuing pattern. They predicted the rate would end the year between 6 per cent and 6.1 per cent. The decline is primarily a result of a shrinking work force rather than job growth.\n\nFed officials also remained sanguine about inflation, making only small changes to their predictions that inflation will remain at or below 2 per cent through 2016.\n\nThere was also little change in the expectations of Fed officials about the timing of an initial rate increase. Twelve of the 16 participants expected a first increase in 2015; half thought the rate would be at or below one per cent at the end of the year.\n\nAbout a year has passed since Fed officials gave the first signal that they would begin to wind down the Fed's stimulus campaign. After buying US$85 billion in bonds each month last year, the Fed has steadily reduced the volume of its monthly purchases; it plans to buy US$45 billion in June, and to end the purchases later this year.\n\nThe economic contraction during the first quarter of this year has not shifted the Fed's plans because officials regard it as a hiccup rather than a change in the economic weather. They have pointed to evidence of stronger growth this spring.\n\nSome private-sector economists agree. James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, says that he sees signs of gathering momentum, including increased lending by banks and borrowing by consumers.\n\n\"The real stimulus comes when the free market starts to stimulate, and that is happening now,\" Mr Paulsen said. \"This is now the most stimulative moment at any time in the recovery,\" he added, as money changes hands more quickly.\n\nBut faster growth may bring its own challenges. The Fed's chairwoman, Janet Yellen, has argued that inflation is not likely to rise as long as millions of people remain unable to find work, allowing the Fed to continue its stimulus campaign.\n\nOther economists, however, predict that inflation will begin to rise more quickly because many people without jobs have been marginalised, and are no longer being treated by employers as effective competitors for available jobs. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

The California-born Singaporean, after all, started his San Francisco Mission-style burrito bar Muchachos a year ago to satisfy a craving for his childhood comfort food.\n\nHis second venture, The Daily Cut, which opens in two weeks, was likewise created from what he saw as the dearth of decent health food joints here.\n\n\"I work out in the gym three to four times a week, and after each session, I want to feed my body a high-protein, nutritious meal that is tasty and also clean, but it is impossible to find anything,\" he explains. \"It's a pain to have to cook it myself, or I have to tell the servers to hold the gravy, the fries and the coleslaw if I eat out. It takes too much effort.\"\n\nHe believes that he isn't the only one in the fitness-obsessed working class in Singapore who is inconvenienced. \"There are a good amount of people out there who want to consume a higher protein diet, but Asian meals tend to be very carbohydrate-heavy. High-protein local options also tend to be battered and deep-fried. The Daily Cut is my answer for people who want to eat healthier but for whom the idea of choking down a salad is repulsive,\" he says.\n\nUnlike salad bar chains where you often have to pay $12 to $15 for a bowl of greens with a just few slivers of meat, The Daily Cut will be protein-centric, says Mr Yang. Its name is a subtle play on words as the process of \"cutting\" in bodybuilding vocabulary refers to a dieting phase focused on gaining muscle mass while shedding fat.\n\nAt The Daily Cut, you custom create a \"meat box\" by first choosing a base protein from options such as salmon, turkey, beef steak, chicken thigh or tofu, and then picking Subway counter-style from complex carbohydrate sides such as sweet potato, brown rice and whole wheat pasta. You complete the box by supplementing it with healthy toppings such as walnuts, almonds, sous-vide-cooked eggs or fresh avocado and mozzarella.\n\nMeat boxes come in three sizes depending on their protein content: regular-sized boxes come with one protein option, large ones with two, or go the whole hog with \"the beast\"-sized servings of your choice of three proteins. No heavy marinades or gravy-coated servings here; all the meats are lightly grilled or roasted and each portion - beef steaks weigh in at 180gm to 220gm, chicken thighs or breast meat at 220gm to 280gm - will be sliced in front of you when you order, \"so people see exactly what they are paying for,\" explains Mr Yang.\n\nLike with Muchachos, Mr Yang is expecting a largely take-away crowd at the 660 square foot, 24-seat eatery in the heart of Raffles Place. It helps too, that there are at least 12 commercial gyms within a kilometre radius around the joint, he observes. \"If no one is doing something like this yet, why shouldn't I be the first one?\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will have luxury hotels, a shopping mall, a theme park, villas and apartments, casinos and other leisure and entertainment facilities.\n\nWith Genting Singapore's recent sterling Q1 results, some analysts have been recommending a buy on the stock, as they expect the Jeju project in South Korea and a potential bid win in Japan next year to boost the share price.\n\nGenting Singapore shares closed trading yesterday unchanged at $1.33.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Last year, our domestic mail volume fell 1.3 per cent, marking the second consecutive year of declines. Escalating operating costs compound our challenges. To make up for declining volumes and higher costs, we had to transform and develop a second wing.\"\n\nDr Baier said that at the same time, the changing landscape saw an explosive growth in e-commerce globally with the e-commerce logistics market in the Asia-Pacific expected to hit US$175 billion by 2016.\n\nHe added that this presented a huge opportunity for SingPost to grow its second wing, and added that the company responded quickly to develop a revolutionary new set of e-commerce models.\n\nSingPost has been in the limelight after Alibaba Group Holding, China's biggest e-commerce company, agreed to buy a 10 per cent stake in the company to develop its logistics in South-east Asia.\n\nAlibaba had said that it would spend $312.5 million to acquire about 220 million new and existing SingPost shares and that the two companies would enter talks for an e-commerce logistics venture.\n\nRecently, CIMB hosted SingPost chief financial officer (CFO) Ng Hin Lee and deputy CFO Daniel Phua at its 4th Annual Asia Pacific Conference. CIMB said in a note later that Alibaba's decision to partner SingPost rather than other regional logistics providers reaffirms the company's leading position in e-commerce logistics. It has also identified Indonesia as a key market in South-east Asia.\n\n\"SingPost offers an attractive dividend yield of 4 per cent while also providing potential earnings upside from the collaboration with Alibaba and M&A activity,\" analysts Jessalynn Chen and Kenneth Ng said.\n\n\"We maintain our add rating and DCF-based target price of $1.86,\" they added.\n\nSingPost shares closed trading yesterday at $1.745, down two cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However, unlike the stereo LPs from two years ago which were directly pressed from the CD masters - a move that had fans and audiophiles up in arms - the new set will not involve any sort of digital manipulation or technology.\n\nInstead, they will be mastered exclusively for vinyl from quarter-inch master tapes at Abbey Road Studios by Grammy-winning engineer Sean Magee and mastering supervisor Steve Berkowitz, who employed the same techniques used in the 1960s and used detailed transfer notes made by the original cutting engineers.\n\nThe pair also worked in the same room at Abbey Road where most of The Beatles' albums were initially cut and dedicated the first weeks to concentrated listening and comparing the master tapes with first pressings of the mono records made in the 1960s. After that, a Studer A80 machine was used to play back the precious tapes from which a new vinyl master was cut on a 1980s-era VMS80 lathe.\n\nThe exhaustive exercise is detailed in the box set's exclusive 12-inch by 12-inch hardbound book featuring new essays and a detailed history of the mastering process by award-winning radio producer-author Kevin Howlett. It also contains many rare studio photos of the band, archived documents, and articles and advertisements sourced from 1960s publications to advertise the LPs.\n\nFor decades, the group's producer George Martin and the mop-topped quartet themselves have explicitly stated the best way to enjoy their music is to listen to it in mono - the predominant audio format before the introduction of stereo. In fact, up until 1968, every Beatles album was issued in both mono and stereo mixes for fans to decide between the two.\n\n'The Beatles in Mono' is out on Sept 8 through Universal Music and available for pre-order now at\n\nwww.thebeatles.com\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Today marks the opening of Fun Art, the first of what she hopes to be a series of pop-up exhibitions featuring works by young artists which are priced affordably. For the inaugural show at Goodman Arts Centre, nearly all the works by eight artists from Singapore, China and Indonesia are priced below $3,000, with 75 per cent of the works priced below $2,000.\n\nMs Hoong has dreamt of a career in art since her 20s. Now 40, Ms Hoong quit her position as a group account director in Ogilvy Beijing a year ago to start Fun Art, which puns on the Chinese word \"fan\" to refer to a tasteful and stylish appearance.\n\nIf the inaugural show does well, Ms Hoong wants to stage a pop-up show every three months at different locations and featuring different artists.\n\nShe says: \"When I was working in Ogilvy Beijing, I spent my free time going to art exhibitions in Beijing's top art schools. I got to know some of the promising students and worked with them to bring their works to Singapore. As it is, a few of them are already in some demand, so I had to work hard to have their pieces appear in this show and in future shows.\"\n\nFour of the featured artists are from China, three from Singapore and one is Indonesian. Most of them are below 30 years old.\n\nMs Hoong says: \"I want to create a more intimate environment for getting to know art, a place where you can stop and chat with the artists, four of whom will be present at the show. It is, in a sense, to counter the busy and crowded art fair scenario of art buying.\"\n\nBecause it's her first show, Ms Hoong is keeping it small with 24 works on display. But she hopes the next show will be a bigger one.\n\nAmong the interesting artists is China's Zhao Shuhong, a 29-year-old printmaking graduate from the Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts. His eye-catching Deconstruction series depicts detailed mini-universes of machinery inhabited by bug-like minions. The lithographs are available in editions of 20 and priced at $1,800 with frame.\n\nAmong the Singaporean artists is Allison Low, a graduate of University of New South Wales College of Fine Arts, whose dark and unsettling images depict young children engaging in less than wholesome games.\n\nFun Art opens today and runs until Sunday at The Gallery at Goodman Arts Centre, 90 Goodman Road, Block B, #01-08, from 10am to 9pm\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It also signals that the status quo would remain, and that Westports' stock is likely to be re-rated upwards.\n\nBusinessman G Gnanalingam, who controls 48 per cent of Westports, seemed cautiously cheerful. He told The Business Times: \"It should augur well for us going forward.\"\n\nHong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing's Hutchison Whampoa holds a 23 per cent interest in Westports.\n\nP3 had, at one time, appeared poised for implementation, having received the approval of the European Commission and the US Federal Marine Commission.\n\nChina's Ministry of Commerce, in throwing a spanner into the works on Tuesday, said that the alliance would hold a combined 46.7 per cent market share, which it said was in breach of its anti-competition policies.\n\nRHB Research cheered the collapse of the P3 plan and called a \"buy\" on Westports, saying that the development could lift the port operator's earnings for the year by 2-3 per cent. The bank also revised the stock's valuation, on a discounted cash flow basis, from RM2.91 to RM3.23 a share.\n\nRHB Research said in a note yesterday: \"The proposed alliance has been a dampener on the longer-term outlook of Westports, as P3 could potentially grow in size.\n\n\"Our earnings upgrades impute a FY15 price-earnings ratio of 22.\"\n\nThe regional industry average of the port operator's peers is 23.\n\nWestports is awaiting government approval for a tariff hike, given that tariffs have remained flat for more than 11 years. RHB estimated that higher tariffs could add RM90 million to Westports' bottom line.\n\nAnother bright spot on the port operator's horizon is that it offers an annual dividend yield of at least 4 per cent and has no debt to speak of.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In particular, improvements in advanced economies will help sustain growth in premium travel ahead, as should easing downward pressure from emerging markets like China.\"\n\nThe Far East market also grew strongly in April, with the number of passengers travelling in premium seats increasing 7.2 per cent year-on-year, compared to the more muted 1.6 per cent seen in March as the Chinese economy posted slower GDP growth in 1Q14.\n\nMarkets linked to the Middle East - such as the Far East, Europe and Africa - continued to perform robustly in April as the Gulf nations recorded high levels of business activity on the back of healthy growth in non-oil-producing sectors.\n\nWithin Europe, the premium travel market was up 2.6 per cent - reversing the contraction of 2.5 per cent in March - with demand for regional air travel likely to improve, thanks to expectations of higher GDP growth in Q2.\n\nWithin North and South America, premium traffic growth was nearly flat and down 8.1 per cent, respectively. However, routes such as North America- Central America and North America-South America posted growth of 11.3 per cent and 3.6 per cent, respectively, supported by the improving economy in the US and strong Central American growth markets.\n\nSince late last year, much of the rising demand for premium travel (which is linked to trade) has been underpinned by a pick-up in the European and US economies.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The battery wires were improperly installed, and an inspection of the beacon's flame-damaged case suggested a short circuit, the agency said.\n\n\"This incident has highlighted that better coordination is required between battery manufacturers, equipment manufacturers, aircraft manufacturers and regulators to ensure equipment-level and aircraft-level safety,\" the agency said.\n\nThe report into the July 2013 fire on the Ethiopian Airlines Enterprise Dreamliner confirmed investigators' preliminary focus on the battery wiring. The blaze initially stirred fresh concern that the 787 had a serious electrical flaw after the global fleet was grounded following two meltdowns on a separate lithium-ion battery system.\n\nUS regulators that oversee Chicago-based Boeing should develop standards for certifying lithium-metal batteries in aviation, the UK board said. Batteries on the Honeywell-made beacons are of the lithium-metal type, and have a different chemistry than lithium-ion models.\n\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) should ask manufacturers to determine the worst possible effects of a thermal runaway and to demonstrate that damage to a single battery cell wouldn't spread to others, causing a fire, the UK board said. The FAA and Boeing didn't immediately respond to requests for reaction to the report.\n\nThe FAA told operators last year to inspect planes with certain Honeywell-made beacons, which are used in thousands of aircraft.\n\nLithium-metal batteries are high-energy storage devices that aren't rechargeable, unlike the 787's rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. While Honeywell created cell separators and safety vents to mitigate the risk of thermal runaway, all five cells of the beacon's battery overheated, the British safety board determined.\n\nThe \"most probable cause\" of the Heathrow 787 fire \"was a short-circuit caused by the improperly installed battery wires, leading to an uncontrolled discharge of the battery\", the board said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The particular national interest made this tie-up especially vulnerable. But there's a real risk China could torpedo other global deals.\n\nAntitrust blocks from China are rare. Though Beijing has made acquirers such as Glencore wait months and agree concessions to win approval, this is the first time the Ministry of Commerce has denied a deal between non-Chinese firms. And it's only the second-ever \"no\" since the regulator blocked Coca-Cola's attempt to buy juice-maker Huiyuan in 2009.\n\nThis is a reminder of the wide-ranging powers granted under China's refreshed competition law six years ago. None of the parties to the deal were Chinese. But groups need only make US$64 million in annual sales in the People's Republic to face scrutiny.\n\nBased on the ministry's terse announcement, the decision seems justifiable. Maersk wanted to cut costs by sharing ships with Switzerland's Mediterranean Shipping and France's CMA CGM. But Chinese shipping associations balked at the proposed \"P3\"network, fearing future price-fixing.\n\nThe ministry concurred, saying the tie-up would have raised the groups' control of the vital Asia-Europe route to levels that would stifle competition and harm the public interest.\n\nThere was an important wrinkle here. Chinese rules are stricter than US or EU laws on classifying some industry alliances as mergers. The P3 network sidestepped formal merger reviews in Brussels and Washington.\n\nBut Chinese law also allows authorities to look more widely at the industrial consequences.\n\nThe P3 alliance would have transformed a sector that houses big Chinese players such as Cosco and China Shipping. Moreover, as the world's largest goods trading nation, with US$4.16 trillion of exports and imports in 2013, China has an obvious interest in ensuring global trade stays cheap.\n\nFor dealmakers, the denial is a shot across the bows just as mergers and acquisitions activity takes off. Global M&A is up 68 per cent in the year to date, at US$1.51 trillion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Other tie-ups such as Holcim-Lafarge are awaiting clearance.

By next year, the wealth that these Asian millionaires hold will also overtake that of their North American counterparts, predicted a report by Capgemini Financial Services and RBC Wealth Management.\n\nThe two regions are already about neck and neck in the number of such high net worth individuals (HNWIs): Asia-Pacific has 4.32 million of them and North America 4.33 million. Together, they account for almost two thirds of the 13.7 million HNWIs in the world.\n\nIn terms of investable wealth, Asians hold US$14.2 trillion, and North Americans US$14.9 trillion. Together, they make up just over half of the world's US$52.6 trillion of HNWI wealth.\n\nBut Asia is growing at a faster pace. That is one of the key takeaways from the 2014 World Wealth Report, said Claire Sauvanaud, vice-president and senior account executive for Capgemini Asia Pacific.\n\n\"Among these high-growth areas are some 'old rich' ones like Kuwait and Norway and the likes of China, Taiwan and Singapore,\" she said. \"Hong Kong is completely off the charts, having benefited from the growth of China.\"\n\nLooking ahead for the next three years, every region except Latin America is expected to grow strongly, with Asia-Pacific growing at almost 10 per cent a year. By contrast, North America is expected to grow just 6.4 per cent a year.\n\nHNWI wealth hit new records in 2013 despite relatively stagnant global economic growth. This is because many persistent economic woes like the eurozone recession and the US debt crisis had faded in intensity, leading to better performance in markets.\n\nThe numbers of the world's wealthy grew the most in the US and Japan last year. The US remains the country with the largest number of HNWIs around the world, at around four million. Japan is second, at 2.3 million.\n\nSingapore's HNWI population grew 4.5 per cent last year to reach 105,000 individuals.\n\nGrowth was driven by the expansion in the economy but was constrained by flat or somewhat declining real estate and stock markets, the report said.\n\nMeanwhile, wealth is unsurprisingly concentrated at the very top. Among the 13.7 million HNWIs with at least US$1 million in investable assets, a mere 0.9 per cent, or around 128,300, have US$30 million or more. These \"ultra-HNWIs\" hold a third of HNWI wealth.\n\nWhere asset allocation is concerned, HNWIs with more than US$20 million in investable assets are shifting their focus the most, from wealth preservation to wealth growth.\n\nCash levels around the world declined from 28.2 per cent in 2013 to 26.6 per cent in 2014. The money went into fixed income and alternative investments - mainly hedge funds and some foreign exchange.\n\nThe wealthy seek to make an impact on their society.\n\nThe top three priorities are health, education, and children's causes.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For example, they lost entire chunks of footage - not once, but twice.\n\n\"When we had to shoot again, we did everything we possibly could: we got a religious master to bless the set, made offerings, and everyone who believed prayed together. After that, filming went smoothly,\" Ong recalls.\n\n\"A lot of the crew also heard noises. We were filming in a hospital basement, and every day at around 2 or 3am, they would hear babies cry - but the hospital had already been converted into an old folks' home,\" adds Ong, though she admits she never had a direct encounter herself.\n\nThe film revolves around Yan Dong (Chin), a horror writer who doesn't believe in the supernatural, He joins a Taoist monastery to get a better experience for his next book and, there, he meets Shan Shan (Ong) - a member of the monastery's funeral troupe, who has many secrets of her own.\n\nChin says that, like his character, he doesn't really believe in ghosts either. However, he has had an encounter of a girl crawling towards him, upside down, which ended up being included in the film.\n\nSurprisingly, both actors insist that neither of them is scared of ghosts. \"I realised ghosts used to be people too, and if you can see them, you might be able to help them,\" says Chin.\n\n\"I think they're just a part of our life,\" adds Ong, who admits she often lets her imagination run wild, especially when they were filming in rural places, and scared herself during the filming process.\n\nAccording to Chin, 80 per cent of The Transcend's plot is made up of real-life ghost stories that have been adapted, and his character and Ong's represent people's general attitude towards the supernatural - whether they are cynics or fervent believers.\n\nShe adds that The Transcend is different from other horror films as it is not the fear that audiences will remember afterwards, but the tragedy and backstory of the spirits in the film. There are also lessons to be learnt, she adds, such as being filial, and being able to let some things go.\n\n\"I love horror movies - I enjoy the thrill, and with a good storyline, it can make a very good film,\" shares Ong.\n\nAdditional reporting by RACHEL LOI\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The entire squad of 23 players and head coach Vicente del Bosque must do a thorough post-mortem and find out how and why everything went pear-shaped.\n\nBefore the tournament, Spain were among the bookies' favourites for the crown. The tiki-taka masters had been prepared to stay in Brazil for the full month; instead, they will now head home before even the first week is out.\n\nThis is the earliest in the 84-year history of the tournament that a defending champion has been ousted before the final group game.\n\nSpain also has the dubious distinction of being the first champion to lose its first two group games. The 1-5 loss to the Netherlands was the worst start to a title defence for a World Cup holder as well.\n\nIt wasn't meant to be this way, of course. But then again, since when did football - or any other sport, for that matter - ever follow a script?\n\nNeither the Dutch nor the Chileans seemed to care much for Spain's golden era of dominance over the last six years, a run that included the World Cup trophy in 2010 sandwiched between European Championship glory in 2008 and 2012.\n\nIf Spain aren't careful, their final opponent Australia - the lowest- ranked nation among the 32 in Brazil - could well drive the final nail into their coffin when the two eliminated teams meet next week to escape the embarrassment of finishing at the bottom of Group B.\n\nThe game against Australia could well be the last time we get to see veterans like goalkeeper Iker Casillas and midfielders Xavi Hernandez and Xabi Alonso.\n\nCoach del Bosque must also shoulder a large chunk of the responsibility for failing to blood in his younger guns much sooner.\n\nThe likes of Koke, Diego Costa and David de Gea are the future of this Spanish national side and must be given the chance to prove their worth.\n\nFor now, Spanish football, its dominance on the European club football stage notwithstanding, will enter a period of mourning.\n\nLeading Spanish newspaper El Pais hit the nail on the head when it described Spain's debacle as \"a nightmare that will last for all time, as will the successes\".\n\nSpain have ruled the football world since 2008, but it is now time to crown a new king of the sport.\n\nThe deposed Spanish players, once they are back home to nurse their wounds, can only look on and wonder what could have been.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Despite a massive aerial and sea search, no sign of the aircraft - which was carrying 239 people - has been found.\n\nAn underwater probe of the Indian Ocean seabed where acoustic signals, thought at the time to have come from the jet's black box recorders, were heard also proved fruitless.\n\nAustralia's Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) said that analysis of satellite and other data to determine the search area for the next underwater phase would be concluded soon.\n\n\"The search area will be confirmed before the end of June, after completion of extensive collaborative analysis by a range of specialists,\" it said in a statement. \"It is already clear from the provisional results of that analysis that the search zone will move, but still be on the seventh arc (where the aircraft last communicated with satellite).\"\n\nThe search has been frustrated by a lack of information, with experts modelling the plane's most likely flight path based on signals between it and an Inmarsat satellite.\n\nThe seventh arc, or \"handshake\", is the final signal from the plane and thought to be when the jet ran out of fuel.\n\nScientists from the British firm have suggested that searchers are yet to target the most likely Indian Ocean crash site because they became distracted by the acoustic signals detected in April.\n\n\"It was by no means an unrealistic location but it was further to the north-east than our area of highest probability,\" Chris Ashton at Inmarsat told the BBC's Horizon programme on Tuesday.\n\nBut JACC said that the area in which the Australian vessel Ocean Shield used a mini-sub to scour the ocean floor was \"based on the best information and analysis available at that time\", including from Inmarsat.\n\n\"The location was identified by the satellite communications sub-group, which included accident investigation agencies from the US and the UK along with their technical advisers, including from the aircraft manufacturer, the satellite manufacturer and Inmarsat as operator of the satellite,\" JACC said yesterday. \"Based on analysis at the time, it represented the most likely location of the aircraft.\"\n\nAustralia, which is leading the hunt given the plane is likely to have crashed in its search and rescue zone, said that the vessel Fugro Equator, which it contracted, had begun its work in mapping the ocean floor.\n\nIt will be joined by Chinese PLA-Navy ship Zhu Kezhen in conducting the bathymetric survey crucial to carrying out the deep water search for the plane which is set to begin in August.\n\n\"So far, the Zhu Kezhen has surveyed 4,088 sq km of the ocean floor,\" before it was forced back to port for repairs, JACC said.\n\nThe survey of a 60,000 sq km search zone was expected to take three months. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Tigerair Mandala recently returned five planes to Tiger, leaving it with a fleet of just four as it restructured its network by cutting frequencies and pulling out of routes amid tough competition from the likes of Lion Air.\n\n\"Mandala's financial results reflect the challenges that it is facing in the difficult operating environment. The partners in Mandala have jointly come to the conclusion to cease funding the airline's operations,\" said Tiger's new group chief executive officer Lee Lik Hsin, stressing that the group would continue to maintain an active presence in Indonesia through Tigerair Singapore.\n\nThe Singapore Airlines (SIA) veteran recently took over from former chief Koay Peng Yen - who announced his resignation after less than two years with the group - effectively giving SIA a tighter grip on the reins. SIA owns 40 per cent of Tiger.\n\nPulling out of Tigerair Mandala will also allow Tiger to devote its full attention to its turnaround strategy, which includes fleet consolidation, strategic alliances and an asset-light growth model, the group said.\n\nOne analyst, who declined to be named, pointed out that the grounding of Tigerair Mandala could help curtail future losses since the budget carrier had contributed to the group racking up hefty losses for the financial year ended March 31, 2014.\n\nAt the same time, he added that this could also potentially mean more aircraft returning to the group. Tiger itself has announced plans to ground eight aircraft - which already included five from Tigerair Mandala - this financial year as it seeks to manage and right-size its fleet, citing overcapacity in the region.\n\nBudget carriers in South-east Asia have been struggling with sliding yields as stiff competition and high costs are squeezing profits.\n\nMeanwhile, Tiger has been divesting itself of or paring its stakes in its associates and subsidiaries of late as it seeks to get itself back on its financial footing. It sold 60 per cent of Tigerair Australia to Virgin Australia and more recently, disposed of its 40 per cent stake in Tigerair Philippines to the Philippines' largest airline, Cebu Pacific. With Tigerair Mandala now preparing to sing its swan song, the group is going back to basics by focusing primarily on its core unit Tigerair Singapore, which has been struggling too.\n\nTiger is also setting up a joint venture with China Airlines, but has limited its stake in Tigerair Taiwan (as it is known) to just 10 per cent.\n\nTiger said all customers affected by the cessation of Tigerair Mandala will be given a flight transfer where possible, or a refund on their ticket.\n\nShares in Tiger closed unchanged at 49 cents yesterday. The announcement came after the market closed.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And the talk is that insiders have benefited, either by buying or selling before the rest of the market. Because this is unfair and undermines confidence, calls are then made for regulators to investigate.\n\nHowever, once the dust has settled and the clamour for official intervention subsided, there is usually resigned acceptance that because proving insider trading is so difficult, pushing for official probes would probably be a waste of time. As time passes, such incidents of what could have been insider trading are then forgotten.\n\nJust how widespread is insider trading? Speak to market observers here and the response anecdotally is that it is fairly common. One dealer said: \"It goes on all the time.\" This is arguably neither here nor there but over in the US, three North American finance professors recently attempted to answer this question through rigorous statistical analysis.\n\nProfessors P Augustin, M Brenner and M G Subrahmanyam in their May 2014 paper \"Informed Options Trading prior to M&A Announcements: Insider Trading?\" (reported in The New York Times on June 16, \"Study asserts startling numbers of insider trading rogues\") examined trading in the options market up to 30 days before M&A announcements and found that about 25 per cent of deals may involve some kind of insider trading.\n\nThe researchers also found that the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) litigated only 4.7 per cent of the 1,859 M&A deals in the study, that the average profit from insider trades was US$1.6 million, that the average insider transacts 16 days before the announcement date and that it took the SEC an average of 756 days or just over two years to publicly announce its first litigation in a given case.\n\nTo lend support to these findings, it was also calculated that the probability of such trades occurring through sheer chance was three in one trillion.\n\nThe suggestion from these findings, of course, is that US regulators are woefully behind the curve when it comes to prosecuting insider trading - not overly surprising, as was evidence that the SEC is more likely to prosecute the bigger deals since being resource-constrained, the regulator prefers cases which offer the biggest \"bang for the buck\" and are more widely covered in the press.\n\nHowever, even though regulatory action appears slow and overly selective, once insider trading was proven, the penalty was on average US$3.5 million - more than twice the average profit and so painful enough to convey some sense of justice having been served.\n\nThe relevance in the local context of such a study should be obvious - ever since the US Federal Reserve announced in May 2013 that it was to taper its money printing, the consequent withdrawal of cash from these shores in favour of Western markets has meant the local market has had to rely on its own internal steam to keep the ball rolling.\n\nIn this regard, the corporate sector has not disappointed - since May last year there have been plenty to get traders excited. There have been reverse takeovers, large-scale investment in small companies by bigger, stronger names, the taking private of several financially sound firms by parent or controlling shareholders, dozens of rights issues and placements, profit-guaranteed agreements and various mega deals with eye-catching headline numbers.\n\nAll have helped keep alive flagging interest in the local stock market; all have offered insiders the potential to benefit illegally from privileged information.\n\nSince there are no concrete indications that foreign money is looking to return in any big or lasting manner to emerging markets - at least not yet - it is to such corporate announcements that the local market will look in the days and months ahead for support and to keep interest alive.\n\nClearly, local regulators will have their work cut out for them, keeping an eye out for suspicious trades as more companies unveil projects, tie-ups and M&A deals to boost share prices.\n\nAfter all, if one in four material announcements in the US probably involves insider trading, what might the proportion here be?\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

If pop music ever wanted to imitate an art performance, this must be it.\n\nJust over an-hour long, the performance was a little brief but quality mattered more than quantity with Hernandez mixing the new songs with reworked versions of familiar ones from her previous albums such as \"Loving Strangers\" and \"I Hate You But I Love You\".\n\nOn the latter which she played before the three-song encore, Hernandez cheekily said that she'd written the lyrics before she came to Singapore. \"But I've changed my mind, I only love you now,\" she announced to the roar of approval from her fans, as an indie class act is born and everybody in the audience looked forward to her fourth visit, which she promised will take place next year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Before this, the shortest had been 21 years, offered mostly for small plots in Tuas South.\n\nBack in mid-2012, the government slashed tenures of sites sold under the Industrial Government Land Sales (IGLS) programme, capping the leasehold period at 30 years.\n\nTenures used to stretch for as long as 60 years.\n\nThe Ministry of Trade and Industry said then that the cheaper shorter-tenure plots would help industrialists to manage costs.\n\nSuch plots also raise the government's flexibility for land redevelopment by lowering the odds that the state would have to buy back a plot from a private owner with compensation.\n\nOf the 15 sites to be released in H2, nine are confirmed-list sites, which are launched according to a schedule, regardless of demand; these sites will yield 12.06 ha of land.\n\nThe remaining six sites are reserve-list sites, which will be launched for tender only upon successful application by a developer with a minimum bid price considered acceptable to the state; the reserve list will yield 6.81 ha.\n\nThe total of 18.87 ha for H2 compares to the 20.42 ha released in the first half of this year - 12.07 ha from confirmed list sites and 8.35 ha through reserve list sites.\n\nA year ago, the H2 2013 programme released 14.52 ha through confirmed list sites and 8.32 ha through reserve list sites (see table).\n\nOf special interest to market watchers is a 20-year leasehold site in Penjuru Road in the mature industrial estate of Jurong, to be launched for tender in October.\n\nTargeted for multiple-user development, the 1.63ha site is zoned for Business-2 or heavier industrial use, and has a 2.5 plot ratio.\n\nThere are now no plans for strata sub-division restrictions for this site, unlike most other sites where strata sub-division is allowed only five years after the temporary occupation permit is obtained.\n\nWith no curbs on strata sub division, a developer can choose to sell or lease units to end users.\n\nThe acts of offering 20-year leases and allowing strata sub-division are aimed at lowering upfront costs for industrialists purchasing these shorter-lease units, but not all analysts agree they would have the desired effect.\n\nTan Boon Leong, the executive director of industrial services at Colliers International, said: \"Prices are not just a function of shorter tenures. If developers think a site is good, they will still bid boldly.\"\n\nSLP International executive director Nicholas Mak pointed out that the shorter tenure would not really help lower the price of the strata units because it is generally construction cost - not land cost - that makes up the bulk of the development cost of an industrial development.\n\nConstruction costs account for about half the total development cost; land cost accounts for about a third, he said.\n\nThe consensus among analysts was also that shorter land tenures will make it harder for buyers to get bank mortgages for these purchases. In issuing loans, some banks require a lease period of at least 10 years at the end of the term loan. Shorter-lease properties may mean higher monthly mortgages, and even if mortgages are successfully obtained, investors may not have enough time to recoup their investments.\n\nAnalysts also noted that all the sites offered in the next six months are zoned for Business-2 activities. This is because there are already enough Business-1 industrial sites (for lighter, cleaner industries) and because Business-2 sites are less likely to attract speculation in industrial land and property.\n\nR'ST Research director Ong Kah Seng said: \"B2-zoned plots cater more to end users who use the sites for conventional industrial production, whereas B1-zoned plots, while relevant to some users, have higher investment value, especially for strata and high-tech factories. What is needed now is sufficient, affordable industrial land for industrialists. Investors are not really the concern at this stage.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By N K YONG\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Jun 19, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nI WOULD like to return to the subject of wine investment for this week's column, especially as a friend of mine has uncovered what looks like a scam.\n\nMy wine investments came about somewhat fortuitously. Interest in wine had led me to the Bordeaux 1982 en primeur campaign through my subscription to the highly respected Decanter magazine in early 1983. The March-June issues of that year were full of the Bordeaux 1982 vintage which was proclaimed as we now know was a very great vintage. And of course I could not resist buying.\n\nWith en primeur prices of Lafite, Latour and the like at \u00a3240 (about S$900 at that time) per case and Petrus at \u00a3500 per case (expensive at the time) I had no choice but to buy. In fact, I should have bought more!\n\nAt the time, I was familiar with only London's and Brussels' wine merchants but that was good enough. In later years I was fortunate to be able to purchase directly from Bordeaux trade and this made my en primeur purchases earlier, and cheaper.\n\nBordeaux Ch\u00e2teaux sell their first tranche (slice) of the wines every year in the en primeur campaign, meaning the \"on first (sale)\", only to the Bordeaux trade, which then re-sells the wines onwards to the rest of the world. This saved one \"mark-up\" in price which can result in quite considerable savings. When you are looking at paying 400 euros (S$680) to 1,000 euros per bottle for First Growths, saving one commission saves you quite a decent sum.\n\nOver the years, until recently, about which I will explain later, it was possible with judicious selection of wines to see your wine stock increase in value by 10-15 per cent year on year. I figured this was better than investments in stocks and shares, and infinitely better than CPF! Besides which I know nothing about stocks and shares, how to read company reports, etc. But I did know a little about wines so it seemed a safer bet. And of course you end up with a lot of \"liquidity\" but not of the kind that you can use as downpayment on a new car or new house.\n\nAnother advantage of investing in wines is that should you find it not profitable to sell; you can always drink up your investment. Both ways you win.\n\nThere are basically two ways to go for those considering wine as an investment vehicle. You can purchase the wines yourself through reliable local or overseas wine merchants who do sell en primeur, which most of the local major wine merchants do. If you are on their mailing list you will get the \"fliers\" and promotional mailers around en primeur time - from end of March to June. You can also get on the mailing lists of the major UK wine houses. The advantages of en primeur sales are several.\n\nThey are accompanied by attractive payment terms - usually in two instalments, the first usually at the end of the year in question and the final instalment by the middle of the following year. En primeur prices are much lower than the prices when the wines are finally released from the Ch\u00e2teaux, which therefore saves you some money. Most important, you get access to premium wines at opening prices. These wines when their bottles are finally released will command much higher prices, thus already providing you with a profit. Note my example of Petrus 1982.\n\nAnother alternative is to invest through companies which specialise in wine investments. This is where caution must be exercised. Wine commerce is full of stories of wine companies, both here and in London which I personally know about, that have gone bankrupt. Those who bought wines en primeur from the companies lost their wines and their money.\n\nThe smart thing is to buy en primeur wines only from reputable wine companies, whether locally or abroad. It is not difficult to find out which local companies one can rely on. With foreign companies, preliminary enquiry from reliable sources is highly recommended.\n\nThe vintage sold en primeur this year was the 2013 vintage. This will be bottled in the second half of the second year following the vintage that is in 2015, but will only be released by the Ch\u00e2teaux in the first or even second quarter of 2016. Buyers will receive their wines in the second half of 2016.\n\nThe next item requiring attention is storage. If one buys from overseas merchants, that is London, the wines can be left with the merchant but will attract storage fees. My experience has been that UK storage fees are very reasonable. Storing with the overseas merchants has the advantage of lower storage charges and proper storage conditions. Always store with bona fide wine storage companies, for example Octavian in London.\n\nA brief word about storage seems appropriate. For proper maturation and development of fine wine, with emphasis on the word \"proper\", long-term storage requires constant temperature and humidity; bottles stored lying down in a room, in the dark and free of any vibratory disturbances, for example a cellar lying under a busy road.\n\nThe temperature has to be a constant 10-14\u00b0 C with a constant humidity of not less than 70 per cent. It pays to be very fussy about how your wines are stored.\n\nAs an aside here, for the benefit of those readers who have considerable stocks of fine wines stored locally, it would be an idea to enquire casually about the storage conditions of the commercial storage you (or your wine merchant) are using. While on this theme, it is also important to check on how the wines are transported from Europe to Asia. The gold standard is shipping by sea in refrigerated containers in which the wines are stored during transit, taking care not to ship in summer.\n\nWe used to think that air-freight is the best way until one was reminded that the cargo hold of an aeroplane is not heated and at high altitudes the temperature in the cargo hold can go close to or below zero centigrade. Readers who have had their wines air-flown from Europe may have wondered why occasionally one finds wine stains running down the label. Or even find a bottle or two with the corks partially extruded?\n\nAll one needs to know is that wine in the bottle is at atmospheric pressure. At 30,000 feet above sea level, the barometric pressure in the cargo hold is below the sea-level atmospheric, the wine will expand and thus the extrusion of the cork. Just simple physics!\n\nThe reason wines should be stored under optimum conditions for long-term storage is that it then allows them to develop and mature to their full potential. One should be like the wine-maker who says that his job is to do nothing except to prevent complications so that your wines will have the optimum conditions which under which they can develop and mature to their full potential.\n\nNext week, the more interesting and sometimes contentious subject of what are the best investment.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The airport, which served 23.3 million passengers last year, no longer operates commercial flights.\n\nHIA, on the other hand, has been built with an eye on future growth. The current handling capacity of 30 million passengers per year will eventually be ramped up to 50 million per year, while its dual-runway system can facilitate up to 90 aircraft per hour.\n\n\"For Qatar Airways, it is an extremely exciting time as we funnel more global passenger traffic through our new Doha hub,\" said chief executive Akbar Al Baker. \"HIA is an important global aviation hub and as Qatar Airways and other airlines add capacity and launch new routes, we anticipate passenger numbers to increase.\"\n\nHIA, Qatar Duty Free and the airport's fast-track service Al Maha Services are all part of the Qatar Airways Group.\n\n\"HIA brings a much-needed addition of capacity for Qatar Airways' hub operations, as well as for the airline's oneworld partners,\" noted CAPA-Centre for Aviation in a recent report.\n\nThe airport may also see a second terminal in the years to come to further boost capacity, depending on traffic growth.\n\nSpanning a third of the size of Doha city, the state-of-the-art airport offers 25,000 square metres of retail space and 15,000 sq m of food & beverage establishments. Meanwhile, 200 hotel rooms are slated to come onstream.\n\nAn automated people mover - an indoor train of sorts - enables travellers to make it to their gates more swiftly for connecting flights. Forty-one contact gates are operational but there will be a total of 65 when HIA is running at full steam.\n\nThe state carrier accounts for a significant number of the flights at HIA, although over 30 other carriers operate out of the new airport too, including Cathay Pacific and Jet Airways.\n\nTo cater to premium passengers, Qatar's national carrier has established a dedicated seated check-in area for First Class passengers and 16 check-in counters for Business Class. Premium passengers also have access to separate passport control counters and e-gates for security screening.\n\nHowever, the airline's Business and First Class lounges are only set to open in another couple of months, as the contractor had \"difficulty keeping up with the kind of finishes we want\", Mr Al Baker was quoted as saying in a media report. Till then, these passengers will be accomodated in the airport's other lounges or given airport vouchers to use if the lounges are full.\n\nEconomy class passengers have the option of paying for the Al Maha fast-track service, which provides lounges with in-built clearance facilities so passengers can be swept speedily through immigration.\n\nIn recent years, the fast-growing Gulf carriers Emirates, Qatar and Etihad have been drawing traffic away from traditional air hubs, aided by their strategic location at the crossroads between Europe and Asia. They're also expanding at a staggering pace - albeit settling for thinner margins in the pursuit of high traffic volume - ordering next-generation aircraft such as the Airbus A350 and Boeing 777X by the dozens.\n\nQatar Airways, which is the launch customer for the A350, has a fleet of 134 aircraft and a further 300 worth US$60 billion on order. And Qatar isn't the only Gulf state building up infrastructure in size and scale.\n\nAbu Dhabi - the home base of Etihad - is working on a new terminal building, due 2017, which will inject some 30 million in passenger handling capacity.\n\nHowever, the title of the Middle East's biggest airport belongs to Dubai International, which saw nearly 66.5 million passengers last year. CAPA expects Dubai International to become the world's busiest by 2015, pipping London's Heathrow after Heathrow posted 0.5 per cent traffic growth in the first quarter of this year vis-a-vis Dubai's double-digit clip.\n\nDubai also opened a second airport, Al Maktoum International Airport, which began commercial flights late last year. While capacity is five million passengers annually, the long-term goal is to boost this to some 160 million per year.\n\nWith regional and Middle Eastern competitors raising the stakes, Changi Airport is working on new terminals as well as transitioning to a three runway system in a bid to maintain its edge. Traffic at Changi has also been rising, bolstered by an emerging middle class in the Asia-Pacific, with the airport hitting a record 53.7 million passengers last year.\n\nSituated on the site of the former Budget Terminal, Changi's T4 will inject an annual handling capacity of 16 million passengers when it opens its doors in 2017. Between T4 and the upcoming mixed use development Project Jewel, Changi's capacity is set to rise from 66 million today to about 85 million by 2018.\n\nAnd planning is also underway for Terminal 5, which will tack on an additional 50 million in passenger handling capacity come the mid-2020s.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Despite the constraints of the young-adult genre, however, The Fault in Our Stars handles its chosen topic with minimum melodrama and considerable aplomb.\n\nThe film, directed by Josh Boone and based on the novel of the same name by John Green, is witty and touching without being too simplistic or overly sweet and sentimental. Written for the screen by Scott Neustadtler and Michael Weber, it shamelessly manipulates our emotions - the audience demands that it does - while showing a strong respect for its source material. For a change, the story is about ordinary people who have real concerns and real conversations - with nary a lovesick vampire or kick-ass girl warrior in sight.\n\nIn a previous era, a generation of young women was weaned on a three-handkerchief weepie called Love Story (1970), which was notable for having one of the corniest lines in movie history: \"Love means never having to say you're sorry.\"\n\nThe Fault in Our Stars targets a slightly younger female demographic but it also has its own candidate for a quotable quote - wisely attributed to a fictional author who happens to be an integral part of the tale. The line - \"Pain demands to be felt\" - is found in the favourite novel of 16-year-old Hazel Lancaster (Shailene Woodley), who relates to a cancer-stricken young girl in the book.\n\nHazel, who serves as the film's narrator, has fourth-stage thyroid cancer but - unlike her parents (Laura Dern and Sam Trammell) - accepts her fate with grace, good humour and a no-fuss philosophy. \"The only thing worse than biting it from cancer is having your kid bite it from cancer,\" she says, almost nonchalantly.\n\nAt a support group meeting, Hazel attracts the attention of Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort), a young man, and fellow cancer victim, with an impossibly sunny disposition and a desperate desire to make a positive impact on the world during the time he has left.\n\nGus has lost part of a leg to disease while Hazel's condition requires her to have tubes inserted into her nostrils and to lug a portable oxygen tank around. They're not your typical cute couple, but getting sympathy is not high on their agenda.\n\nBoth are interested in confronting the truth, no matter how painful it might be. Gus manages to obtain an invitation from author Peter van Houten (Willem Dafoe) to visit Amsterdam so Hazel can ask him to address some unanswered questions about the characters in his book. The trip marks a departure from a predictable storyline and turns into a journey of discovery in more ways than one.\n\nThe Fault in Our Stars may take a PG approach to a delicate issue but it does provide viewers with fully fleshed out characters that we learn to care about.\n\nThe prospect of death may be always present but these kids take on the harsh realities of life with (metaphorically speaking anyway) a spring in their step and a smile on their face; somehow, being in love makes those tough choices a little easier.\n\nRating:\n\nB-\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Most traders are not making money in the difficult market, one source added.\n\nAnother trading executive said that \"while some Iraqi cargoes do come here, and comprises high-quality stuff, Iraq only accounts for a fraction of global production\".\n\nThis is borne out by the just-released BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2014, which showed that Iraq - despite being the second-largest Gulf producer after Saudi Arabia - accounted for just 3.7 per cent of global oil production last year. In fact, rising oil production in the US (which accounted for 10.8 per cent of global production in 2013) and in Russia (12.9 per cent) is quickly closing in on Saudi levels (13.1 per cent last year).\n\n\"Thus despite oil product prices here rising across the barrel, the Singapore market in fact remains very quiet,\" another oil trader told BT.\n\nMost product prices here remain in backwardation, he said, referring to a market situation where the price of a forward or futures contract is trading below the spot price.\n\n\"This is because global oil supply and demand remains balanced, with the current spike in prices due largely to traders speculating on the war,\" said the trading executive. \"Otherwise Brent would have shot to US$150,\" he remarked, referring to the last all-time record price.\n\nStill, if nothing else, the Iraqi flare-up has helped to ignite a spark in the otherwise \"flat\" market here. \"Most players are taking a watch-and-see approach, to see if there are trading opportunities from the Iraqi situation,\" one player said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It also expanded into complementary businesses in hospitality management and healthcare real estate. It listed its hospitality assets in Far East Hospitality Trust in August 2012.\n\nThrough strategic partnerships forged with Toga Group in Australia and The Straits Trading Company Limited last year, Far East Orchard extended its footprint from existing markets Singapore and Malaysia to Australia, China, Denmark, Germany, Hungary and New Zealand.\n\nMr Chow will also retire as executive director of Far East Organization, where he provided strategic counsel on new business growth and brand development and served on several executive committees. He was chief executive at MediaCorp from December 2005 before stepping down in 2011 to join Far East.\n\nWhile expressing deep appreciation for Mr Chow, Far East Orchard chairman Koh Boon Hwee also welcomed Mr Lui on board.\n\nMr Lui has extensive experience in finance and management in listed companies.

Year-to-date, debt issuance from Singapore issuers rose 8.3 per cent year-on-year to US$12.1 billion.\n\nIn terms of all Singapore-dollar issuance, second-quarter proceeds rose 18.6 per cent year-on-year to S$4.7 billion. That brought the first-half total to S$10.9 billion, a 21.4 per cent increase. Singapore outpaced the region in the first half, with South-east Asian aggregate volume up 16.1 per cent at US$32 billion, said Thomson Reuters. \"It's very much a record second quarter if you look at it on a US-dollar basis (in Asia),\" ANZ head of Asia debt capital markets Jimmy Choi said.\n\nShows of strength were all around.\n\nHainan Airlines sold 1.7 billion yuan (S$341.5 million) of three-year offshore renminbi (RMB) bonds at a 6.25 per cent coupon last month to become the first corporate \"Lion City\" bond to be cleared and deposited in Singapore. Mr Lee said that investors in the offshore RMB space are looking more closely at credit now that the currency appreciation theme is no longer as assured.\n\n\"You don't have that speculation, so that market is on more fundamentally solid ground,\" he said.\n\nPerpetuals also made a comeback, with Trafigura Beheer BV selling S$200 million of 7.5 per cent step-up perpetual securities. Elsewhere in the region, Hong Kong-listed Far East Horizon sold US$200 million of perpetuals, while Thailand's PTT Exploration and Production sold US$1 billion of perpetuals a week ago, a feat considering the country's recent coup.\n\n\"It just goes to show how much liquidity there is in the market right now, with investors looking to move down the capital structure to pick up slightly more yield,\" said Simon Page, head of debt capital markets in South-east Asia at JP Morgan. \"It's a reflection of the increase in liquidity, low interest rates, and it comes down to people's rate expectations.\"\n\nThat interest rates did not go up as much as expected emboldened some companies to do some opportunistic fundraising.\n\n\"Companies are taking as much long duration as they can,\" Mr Choi said.\n\nThe banks also helped to boost issuance. \"What's really driven the three bank-capital trades has been the strong market and the low interest rates,\" Mr Page said. \"Both OCBC and UOB have old-style Tier 2 bonds maturing later this year and so they have been opportunistic in taking advantage of strong demand and low spreads to issue Basel III-compliant Tier 2's.\"\n\nThe bankers said that they were cautiously optimistic that the momentum of the first half of 2014 will continue into the second.\n\n\"Our view is that over time, as you probably know, rates will have to trend upwards,\" Mr Choi said. \"Rates will be rangebound, spreads will come in minimally tighter because monetary policy is very accommodative . . . The biggest headline risk is geopolitical risk.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The iconic commissions will be the monumental Apollo and Artemis apple sculptures by Kumari Nahappan, but visitors can expect to encounter art in practically every corner of the complex which will see three hotel concepts in one, medical clinics and a hospital.\n\nKumari was the first artist the Farrer Park Company commissioned, even before a space had been found for her works, says Richard Helfer, a board member and the man steering the hotel project. From there, the company went on to commission a number of artists from Singapore and Asia - with 60 per cent of the works from Singapore - to build up a corporate collection.\n\n\"As an owner-operated, independent hotel, we just saw the opportunity to build an art collection into the hotel at its design stage rather than as an after-thought,\" says Dr Helfer. \"It's also a chance for us to support the art community in Singapore and the region, and work with them directly.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They can hold the Right to Use title or \"Hak Pakai\" for 25 years, which can be extended for a further 20 years, and is renewable thereafter.\n\nDoris Tan, head of international residential properties at JLL, noted that buyers are attracted to homes in Bintan and Funtasy because of the lower quantum and guaranteed rental yield in some instances.\n\nSo far, overseas buyers are not overly concerned about foreign ownership restrictions on property in Indonesia, she said. \"The law is transparent and people are comfortable buying from the big names.\"\n\nBanyan Tree recently sold serviced apartments under its Cassia brand in Phuket and Bintan to buyers in Singapore at an average price of $250,000. It offers no rental guarantee but estimates that gross rental yields could be 6 to 7 per cent.\n\nMr Leong said that Treasure Bay Bintan will make sure buyers have the Right to Use title for the serviced apartments over a period of 60 years. It will also offer a guaranteed rental return over a period but this is not finalised yet. These four-star to five-star serviced apartments will be managed by an international hotel chain.\n\nAs for Funtasy Island, Mr Yong said that PT Batam Island Marina, the developer behind the project, has undertaken to pay the lease renewal up to year 2112 for foreign home buyers. The villas and condos are mainly targeted at Singaporeans and expatriates living here. The smaller units, typically under half a million dollars, come with average rental yield guarantee of 6 per cent for five years.\n\nA joint-venture agreement was inked yesterday between Funtasy Island Development and Seven Seas Properties to develop a $200 million eco-theme park on Funtasy Island.\n\nSeven Seas president and CEO Lim Chee Yong said he expects the payback period for this project to be five to seven years.\n\nThe 328-hectare park is touted to be the largest eco-theme park in the world when it is fully operating by 2017. A ferry service between Singapore and Funtasy Island will also begin next year.\n\n\"For this project, the key is nature,\" Mr Yong said. Only 30 per cent of the 810 acres of tropical islands making up Funtasy Island is set aside for villas, apartments, a convention centre and other facilities, while 70 per cent is reserved for nature sanctuary.\n\nThe number of visitors on Funtasy Island, including residents, will be capped at 1.5 million each year to prevent over-crowding and disruption to the environment.\n\nStill, some 1,200 rooms are needed to accommodate one million visitors a year. There could be a shortfall of 274 rooms in 2017 which could increase to 783 rooms in 2019, Mr Yong said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The vessels will be delivered from 2016 to 2017. The customer is an Australia-listed ore company.\n\nYangzijiang executive chairman Ren Yuanlin said that the industry was seeing rising demand for larger vessels with higher carrying capacity due to shipowners' increasing focus on vessel operational efficiencies.\n\n\"The demand uptrend for such vessels is in line with the group's goal to scale the shipbuilding value chain,\" he added.\n\nBreaking into a new geographical reach demonstrated shipowners' growing confidence in the company's shipbuilding competency, said Yangzijiang.\n\nMr Ren said that the group's investment size in non-core businesses - property development and held-to-maturity investment - \"will be closely monitored and kept under control\". The focus on its core shipbuilding business also encompasses related businesses such as shipping logistics and trading.\n\nOSK DMG said: \"While we had no issues with its diversification strategy in the past, we believe the group's strategic shift could be strongly positive for investor sentiment.\"\n\nThe research firm maintained its \"buy\" rating on the stock of the company, with a target price of $1.55.\n\nYangzijiang shares closed up 4.5 cents at $1.105 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

New York-based Blackstone has invested US$1 billion in commercial property across India to become the largest landlord in the country among private-equity investors, said IIFL, a Mumbai-based brokerage.\n\nDemand for Grade-A offices will climb 3 per cent to 22.9 million square feet in 2014 from last year, the first increase in three years and the highest since 2012, according to broker Cushman & Wakefield. The strongest demand will be in Bengaluru, the southern city formerly known as Bangalore, followed by the capital New Delhi and its surrounding area, the financial hub of Mumbai and Pune, a satellite town, south-east of Mumbai, the New York-based broker said.\n\nOffice rents in India's main central business districts have declined about 5 per cent since the first quarter of last year to the lowest since 2011, said Sigrid Zialcita, managing director of research for Asia-Pacific at Cushman & Wakefield in Singapore. Rents in Mumbai's CBD, at US$4.5 per square foot per month in the quarter ended March, compare with US$6.61 in Shanghai, data from Cushman & Wakefield showed.\n\nThe Indian rupee was the worst-performer against the dollar in Asia from 2011 to 2013, dropping 26 per cent. This year, the currency is the fourth-best performer in the region, up 2.4 per cent, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.\n\n\"The current trend emphasises the growing sophistication and effort made by global investors in seeking strong themes, even in seemingly challenging geographies to benefit from pockets of growth,\" said Priyaranjan Kumar, the regional director of capital markets at Cushman & Wakefield in Singapore.\n\nXerox, the US printer and photocopier pioneer, and Australia & New Zealand Banking Group, Australia's third-largest lender, are among companies that have opened new offices in the past year as expectations that newly elected Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will revive the economy have grown since his landslide victory last month.\n\nIndia has been in the top five global office markets for at least the past seven years, with average annual net demand of more than 30 million square feet, Cushman & Wakefield said.\n\nThe recovery is helping to resolve a glut. India's slowing economy had led to declines in office occupancies that froze development and prompted some builders to convert commercial projects into housing.\n\nOffice demand fell 5 per cent in the first quarter to about 6.3 million square feet from 6.6 million square feet in the same period a year earlier, said property broker CBRE Group. The demand is at its lowest in eight years, dropping 45 per cent from the high in 2008, as inventories peaked amid more supply, IIFL said.\n\nVacancy rates in Mumbai, which peaked at 22.8 per cent in 2012, declined to 19.7 per cent in the quarter ending in March from the previous quarter, Cushman & Wakefield said. In Gurgaon, near New Delhi, they fell to 10.49 per cent in the three months ended March from 12.32 per cent in the December quarter, it said.\n\nXander Group, with about US$2 billion of equity capital in property assets, and a consortium led by Dutch pension fund asset manager APG announced a US$300 million venture last month that will buy commercial assets across India's main office markets. The APG-led group is seeking to capitalise on demand from companies in the information technology and financial services industries that serve global businesses from hubs across India.\n\n\"India's top six cities have consistently witnessed the largest net absorption of office space in the Asia-Pacific region, and perhaps globally,\" Sachin Doshi, head of non-listed real estate for Asia-Pacific at APG in Hong Kong said last month.\n\n\"This, combined with limited new developments for office projects in India, creates a unique demand-supply gap for good quality office space.\"\n\nAmong others, GIC, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, and Ascendas, a Singapore-based business-park developer, plan to invest as much as S$600 million in Indian commercial property to meet rising demand, they said in November. Through a fund, they will invest in business space in Bangalore, Chennai, New Delhi and surrounding areas, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Pune, the companies said.\n\nCompanies across Europe indicated an increased appetite for global expansion into India, according to an April 28 report by CBRE. Almost half of the firms that responded to the survey said that India was their destination of choice because of rapid population growth and gradually recovering economic prospects, beating China as a preferred location, CBRE's European Occupier Survey showed. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

The plan horrified some neighbours and government officials, who thought the new building would be too big and unattractive. After the municipality refused to allow the demolition, Mr Zeng's lawyers appealed to a state judge, who overruled that decision.\n\nFrom London to midtown Manhattan to Hong Kong's Victoria Peak, wealthy Chinese - often connected to powerful political figures - are buying up some of the world's best real estate. Australia relies on China to buy much of its two main exports, coal and iron ore. But many say there's a downside to Chinese investment: surging property prices.\n\nEven though Australia is sparsely populated, house prices in its biggest cities are comparable to those in Washington, San Francisco and Paris.\n\nSydney's average house price rose 15 per cent to the equivalent of US$613,000 in the year ended March 31, according to RP Data-Rismark, a research firm. Apartments overlooking the city's famous Opera House sell for more than US$10 million. Many younger college-educated Australians find it impossible to afford homes close to their workplaces without parental assistance.\n\n\"A generation of Australians are being priced out of the property market. Many face a lifetime of renting,\" an analyst at investment bank Credit Suisse, Damien Boey, wrote in a recent note to clients.\n\nCredit Suisse estimates that 18 per cent of all new houses and apartments in Sydney are bought by Chinese citizens. In Melbourne, the figure is 14 per cent.\n\nThese figures are likely to rise. To stimulate the economy, the Australian government recently expanded a programme to grant permanent residency to foreigners prepared to invest at least A$5 million in Australian businesses. Ninety per cent of the applicants so far are Chinese.\n\nConcerns that Chinese buyers could be driving a property bubble are so widespread that the Australian Parliament recently began an investigation into the possibility.\n\nResearch given to the inquiry by two academics found that people with Chinese surnames paid slightly less than other buyers for similar houses and apartments in Sydney, suggesting they are tough negotiators and aren't pushing up prices.\n\nMany Australians aren't convinced, according to submissions to the inquiry from the public. \"Widespread injustice will continue with Australians being outbid by foreigners on an uneven playing field,\" a woman named Pat Sutton wrote to the investigators.\n\nThe concerns reflect a belief among many people that Chinese citizens are using cities such as Sydney - an 11 +1/2-hour flight from Beijing - to protect their wealth from theft or seizure by the Chinese government.\n\nMr Zeng and his wife may have had another reason to choose their new home apart from Australia's strong defence of property rights and the 180-degree views of Sydney Harbour. Feng shui expert Gary Khor recently told the Sydney Morning Herald that Point Piper, the wealthy suburb where Craig-y-Mor is located, contains positive energy because it overlooks calm, moving water and has a hill to its rear.\n\nLittle is known about Mr Zeng's personal or professional life. His father is Zeng Qinghong, the vice president of China from 2003 to 2008 and a player in the leadership manoeuvring over the past decade that led to the rise of President Xi Jinping.\n\nForeign Policy magazine reported in 2012 that the younger Zeng was involved in the clandestine privatisation of the state-owned Luneng power generating company, which had over US$9 billion in net assets.\n\nWorkers began demolishing the home last month, an event that was front-page news here.\n\n\"They are knocking down something that was modest and thoughtful and replacing it with something that doesn't even have a thought in its head,\" said Elizabeth Farrelly, Sydney's most prominent architecture critic, in an interview.\n\nBill Malouf, a veteran real estate agent whose firm brokered the sale of the house, said in an interview that Craig-y-Mor wasn't in need of renovation. Chinese buyers prefer modern, symmetrical houses lacking the ornate detail common to many of Sydney's grand older homes, he pointed out. Views of the Sydney's iconic Opera House and Harbour Bridge are important, he added.\n\n\"He was always going to do a major renovation,\" Mr Malouf said of the buyer. \"There was nothing wrong with the house.\"\n\nThe construction site at Craig-y-Mor has now turned into a regular stop on the Chinese tourist circuit, along with Bondi Beach and the Harbour Bridge. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

Japan's pension fund, the world's largest, is thus signalling that it wants to improve corporate governance among companies, as well as investor returns, he said.\n\nMr Treves was giving his perspective on the Japanese equity market, which had flattened out in the first half of this year after a remarkable 60 per cent surge last year.\n\nJapan had dropped off the radar of global investors in the past 20 years as deflation and economic stagnation set in after its asset bubble burst. Each time after a run-up, shares declined further. Investors now fret that the current run-up is another false dawn. But Mr Treves believes that the country has hit the bottom and can only go up from here.\n\nThe 2011 earthquake and tsunami, followed by nuclear power accidents, was a \"wake-up call\" that the status quo could not be sustained, he said. Adding to the impetus for change was the rise of China, which Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe used to rally domestic opinion, Mr Treves added.\n\nHe said that last year's massive rally in stocks - driven by the depreciation of the yen and the resumption of animal spirits - was also because markets realised how cheap Japanese stocks were. Unfortunately, markets also took Mr Abe at his word that he will change everything at once.\n\nYet change in the culturally conservative country of more than 120 million people will take many years, Mr Treves said. He is waiting for checkpoints in the process. They include what corporates can do in the new special economic zones being set up, workforce deregulation, more female participation and better corporate governance.\n\nFidelity's portfolio managers are also looking at stocks exposed to the provision of childcare, elderly services, medical devices and automation, he said.\n\nUltimately, Japan's fundamentals are looking better; asset prices, at an average of 11 times earnings, are relatively cheap; and many buyers have stayed on the sidelines, he said.\n\nMr Treves is not alone in his views. A June 18 report by French bank Societe Generale said that corporate savings in Japan will continue to decline. The bank expects a recovery in domestic demand as well as a continued decline in unemployment.\n\nMark Burgess, chief investment officer of Threadneedle Investments, also said in a June report that the fund cut holdings in government and investment-grade debt in late May and reinvested the money in Japanese equities.\n\n\"The fundamentals here continue to improve while the market has lagged other developed regions over 2014 to date,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Some even went so far as to suggest that Klinsmann was now flip-flopping on his earlier assessment of his team's chances.\n\nOn at least three previous occasions, the 49-year-old had publicly declared that his players had no chance of winning the World Cup and that any expectation of them doing so was simply unrealistic.\n\nBut after masterminding a remarkable 2-1 victory over long-time foes Ghana yesterday morning in Natal, those sentiments have now changed.\n\nWas Klinsmann playing mind games all along? Did he want to give his opponents the false impression that the United States was in Brazil just to make up the numbers?\n\nOf course, even with three big points in the bag, any talk of the Red, White and Blue going all the way is still very premature. There's still the small matter of The Yanks going toe-to-toe with the two heavyweights in Group G (Germany and Portugal) over the coming week.\n\nBarring a major collapse, a free-scoring Germany should top the group with ease, leaving the other three nations to slog it out for the second qualifying spot for the knockout stage.\n\nKlinsmann probably won't be so brash about his team's chances from now on with two tough games to come, but he might secretly be fancying pulling off another big upset - against the Portuguese on Sunday - in the rainforest capital of Manaus.\n\nPortugal, a team laden with superstars like Cristiano Ronaldo, is still smarting after a 4-0 defeat to the Germans, just hours before the US overturned the form book and stunned Ghana. The Stars and Stripes did it in style, too, with Clint Dempsey netting the fastest goal of the tournament after just 29 seconds.\n\nThe Black Stars - who ousted the US in the last two World Cup tournaments in 2006 and 2010 - equalised eight minutes from full time, but it was American defender John Brooks who stole the headlines with a header to seal the win.\n\nThe question on everyone's lips is just how far this young and energetic US side will progress. History is certainly in their favour. The statistics show that 39 out of 46 teams that won their first match at the last four World Cups eventually made it to the next round.\n\nThere have been shocks aplenty in this year's tournament. Who could have foreseen the US finally getting their revenge on Ghana, or little-known Costa Rica putting former world champion Uruguay to the sword?\n\nWho knows, if the surprise results continue, Klinsmann will probably not have to catch an earlier flight home.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Another would not be ready at all. Violent street protests would threaten fans and upstage everything. Airport and subway strikes would strand tens of thousands of visitors.\n\nThese, and other doomsday predictions, were perpetual concerns in the days leading up to the World Cup in Brazil. But after nearly one full week of games, the situation in South America's largest country is hardly bleak. For those fans who enjoy eye-popping goals, surprising results and stylish soccer, this tournament has, so far, been an incredible success. The games are enthralling and the drama has been perfect for television.\n\nYet, from a logistical perspective, not all has gone swimmingly, particularly for some people on the ground who may appreciate smaller details such as consistent electricity, fully finished stadiums and correctly numbered stadium seats. For them, the early returns on the World Cup are a bit more complex.\n\nIt should be said: Virtually no one puts on a major sporting event such as the World Cup or the Olympics without a few issues. This year's Sochi games in Russia had its stray dogs and incomplete (or occasionally missing) hotels. The 2004 Summer games in Athens had worker strikes, infrastructure mishaps and eleventh hour hysteria over a plethora of venues. Even the Olympic Park at the 2012 London games was a hard-hat zone a week before the opening ceremony.\n\nGiven that reality, Brazil surely deserves plenty of latitude. But with each of the 12 host cities now having hosted at least one game, it seems that organisers are toeing - if not straddling - the line between normal hiccups and a more irritating lack of preparedness.\n\nThe range of problems has been broad. Some have had to do with construction, such as the visible electrical wires in Sao Paolo's stadium or the workers still installing air-conditioning units and carpeting hours before kick-off in Cuiaba. Some have had to do with employee relations, like the 30 per cent of baggage checkers who did not show up for work in Brasilia, leading to spectator gridlock outside the turnstiles. Some have been cosmetic, like the burned-out grass in Manaus, which led workers to spray-paint patches of the field green.\n\nNone of it has been wholly detrimental - the games have all gone on as scheduled - yet each day has brought a new bump which, in many cases, is something one would never imagine as a potential problem. On Sunday in Porto Alegre, for instance, the stadium's sound system failed as the teams walked onto the field, leaving players from France and Honduras infuriated as they stood around waiting for national anthems that were never played.\n\n\"Many players here on the team, it's their first World Cup,\" Roger Espinoza, a Honduran midfielder, said. \"Not being able to listen to the national anthem, I think, is kind of like disrespectful in a way.\"\n\nFrance ended up winning the game, 3-0, but the glitch still stung. \"The only thing that frustrated me,\" said the French midfielder Antoine Griezmann, \"was the absence of La Marseillaise.\"\n\nBrazilian organisers have been a mixture of defensive and apologetic about the mishaps. Andres Sanchez, a former president of the Sao Paolo club Corinthians who was involved in the construction of the new stadium, said that Arena Corinthians had issues because \"Corinthians started a year and a half later than the other arenas and we also had the accidents that unfortunately delayed the work a little longer.\"\n\nHe added: \"Then we had also some normal delay.\" Asked to elaborate on what \"normal delay\" means, he referred to typical Brazilian bureaucracy and said: \"We want the best - unfortunately it is not possible to satisfy everyone.\"\n\nTo be fair, luck is always a factor in these spectacles. Any big event can have an unseen slip-up, as the NFL learned in 2013 when the Super Bowl was delayed for nearly an hour after a blackout plunged the Superdome in New Orleans into darkness. By comparison, the bank of lights that went out at Sao Paolo's stadium during the World Cup opening match was a minor blip.\n\nYet, there have also been plenty of avoidable issues. Some fans attending games at Arena das Dunas in Natal received e-mails informing them that they would need to exchange their tickets for new ones because a portion of the seats at the stadium had not been installed.\n\nThen again, at least they were told ahead of time. Ian Greenfield, a lawyer from south-west London, showed up at Arena da Amaz\u00f4nia for England's game against Italy in Manaus with a group that had purchased four tickets in the same row: Seats 13 to 16. When they arrived, alas, they quickly realised that their assigned row was numbered only up to 15 before the numbering started over at 1. \"They sold a ticket that didn't have a seat,\" Mr Greenfield said.\n\nHungry fans in Manaus were also out of luck because many concession stands either ran out of food early in the match or had nothing on sale at all. That was similar to the situation at the first game here, where many Mexico fans attending the match against Cameroon went to merchandise booths, but found no merchandise on sale.Other hurdles have been more problematic, particularly as they relate to security. A handful of Argentine fans prompted security protocols to be reviewed in Rio de Janeiro after they hopped a fence in an attempt to get into Estadio do Maracana for Argentina's game with Bosnia and Herzegovina. There was also an alarming episode in Cuiaba, where fans of Chile set off fireworks inside the stadium after their team sealed a victory over Australia.\n\nIn general, the playing conditions for most of the matches have been excellent, which, in cities such as Natal and Salvador - where the fields were battered with unusually heavy rain - was a testament to the quality of the drainage systems.\n\nUltimately, this is the most important priority since it is the games that generally define an event's historical legacy. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

That's how Somalia got started.\" In recent years, global concern over piracy has focused on attacks by trigger-happy Somali pirates off East Africa.\n\nAn international naval effort has virtually stamped out that threat - but in the meantime, South-east Asian piracy attacks have crept back up, increasing from 46 in 2009 to 128 last year, according to the IMB, and are on a similar pace for 2014.\n\nMost are localised robbery attempts in Indonesia's vast waters for relatively small stakes, the IMB said. It added that major lanes such as the Malacca Straits remain safe, with only one attack this year.\n\nTens of thousands of ships pass through the strait annually.\n\nBut the spurt of brazen incidents raises fears of a return to the frequent hijackings and kidnappings by mostly Indonesia-based armed pirates seen a decade ago, especially as successful piracy usually breeds more.\n\nIn one attack on May 28, the Thai tanker MT Orapin 4 was hijacked north of Indonesia's Bintan Island.\n\nThe pirates reportedly painted over its name, destroyed communications equipment and brought in a smaller tanker vessel to siphon off much of the ship's 3,700 tonne oil cargo. The vessel and crew were later released.\n\nSimilar incidents have been repeated, possibly indicating serial action by the same gangs.\n\nThe elaborate operations, said experts, suggest coordination with criminal syndicates organised enough to move such large cargoes to market.\n\n\"Maritime crime has always been an issue in the region, but we are seeing an increase in hijackings for cargo. The black market for marine gas oil is extremely lucrative,\" said David Rider, editor of the Maritime Security Review, who wrote recently that the new attacks had \"taken everyone by surprise\".\n\nSouth-east Asian piracy remains relatively benign compared to a decade ago. Pirates rarely carry guns, while taking hostages for ransom has stopped, said Mr Choong.\n\nBut the lucrative stakes could lead to more attacks, with East and West Africa offering chilling cautionary examples.\n\nThe lust for tanker cargoes has turned waters near oil-rich Nigeria into the world's major area of piracy concern due to the often deadly shoot-first attacks by gun-toting pirates, Mr Choong said.\n\nMartin Sebastian, head of Malaysia's Centre for Maritime Security and Diplomacy, said that growing South-east Asian sea traffic complicates enforcement while offering increasingly enticing pickings. \"Where there is money, the pirates emerge,\" he said.\n\nThe IMB is urging regional authorities to beef up naval patrols, and recommending round-the-clock anti-piracy watches on vessels.\n\nSome calls have emerged for armed private security on ships - but that is expensive, and in any case banned in Indonesian, Malaysian and Thai waters.\n\nPiracy experts said that the region is better-positioned today to snuff out any resurgence following the successful suppression of recent years.\n\nAn Indonesian navy spokesman said that his country's forces are continuing to coordinate on patrols with its neighbours.\n\nBut pirates are also smarter, and are exploiting national sea boundaries and the limitations of regional naval forces to evade detection, said Bantarto Bandoro, a security expert at the Indonesian Defence University.\n\n\"They have good information on who is being monitored, where the sea is being monitored - and their intelligence gathering is improving,\" he said, adding that international coordination remains insufficient.\n\nSouth-east Asia has a checkered history of cooperation on various issues, and combating resurgent piracy will ultimately require close coordination to root out onshore criminal gangs believed to be fuelling it, Mr Sebastian said.\n\nRegional economies will be burdened with extra costs, including higher shipping insurance rates and more spending on security assets, \"if we don't nip it in the bud\", he warned. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

These included Japanese clothes manufacturer Fast Retailing, South Korea's Hyundai Heavy Industries and Australian construction firm James hardie Industries.\n\nNo company reported a negative outlook, a historic first for the survey, which was first conducted in the second quarter of 2009.\n\nTheir sunny responses bumped up the Thomson Reuters/Insead Asia Business Sentiment Index to 74 in the second quarter, up from 64 in the first quarter.\n\nThis is the highest reading since the start of 2012. A reading above 50 indicates an overall positive outlook.\n\nOver in India, companies were bullish after Narendra Modi, said to be pro-business, became the prime minister.\n\nThere is also stronger confidence in Thailand following a military coup and amid hopes that political unrest will come to an end. Business outlook there turned positive in the second quarter, after two quarters of negativity.\n\nOn a sectorial comparison, sentiment for the building sector jumped significantly this quarter, as construction firms registered an increase in new orders and sales. Business sentiment for resource companies also stood at a three-year high, on the back of stronger revenue.\n\nBut there are pockets of wariness. Among the industries, companies in Asia's financial sector were the most pessimistic, as economic uncertainty takes hold. This also comes as the impact of regulations - particularly on the cost of capital - starts to bite, said David Sayer, KPMG's head of global banking.\n\n\"The entire economic model of banks has been challenged,\" he told The Business Times.\n\nCompanies in both the food and beverage industry, and in the retail sector, also reflected concerns over rising costs. The survey respondents included a number of Japanese corporations, such as Asahi Breweries and retailer Seven & I Holdings, the report said.\n\nStill, a senior banker from a European bank said retailers must now respond to consumers' preferences and shopping patterns more quickly than before. This means that if a certain design is expected to be popular in the next week or so, the retailer would have to engage manufacturers that are efficient, as opposed to hiring factories that are just competing on price alone.\n\nThe outlook among Singapore businesses remained consistent compared to a quarter ago. The sentiment index stood at 67, with two of six respondents registering a positive outlook, while the rest stayed neutral.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In fact, Guillermo Ochoa isn't even employed at all, having departed French side AC Ajaccio last month following the Corsica-based team's relegation to the second division.\n\nNow a free agent, Ochoa, who turns 29 on July 13 - the day of the World Cup final in Rio de Janeiro, coincidentally - certainly won't have any shortage of potential suitors from now on. He could probably take his pick of any club from a long list that will probably seek his services, all without having to pay a transfer fee too.\n\nForget the Great Wall of China. This Great Wall of Mexico dug deep into his bag of tricks and produced a series of stunning goal-line saves, including one incredible diving stop to deny a Neymar header that was destined for the back of the net.\n\nNeymar stared at him in disbelief. That save immediately evoked memories of Englishman Gordon Banks' famous save from Pele at the 1970 World Cup.\n\nAt times, the vociferous Mexican supporters in Fortaleza's Castelao Stadium couldn't bear to watch whenever Brazil powered forward in droves in search of the breakthrough. Surely Ochoa's luck would run out at some stage during the 90 minutes, they felt.\n\nIt didn't, and at the final whistle, millions of Brazilians were tearing their hair out in frustration as they watched the Samba Kings' 10-match winning streak come to an end. Ochoa's heroics turned him into an overnight sensation, with fans describing him as a \"Superman\" between the posts. One netizen wondered if he was really from Mexico and not the planet Krypton.\n\nSomeone even hacked into the Guadalajara native's Wikipedia page to proclaim him as the \"Mexican Jesus\" after he repelled wave after wave of Brazil's relentless attacks, thwarting attempts from Paulinho and Thiago Silva among others.\n\n\"It was the game of my life, without a doubt,\" he said shortly after the 0-0 draw. That is quite the understatement, coming from a player who has waited eight long years to make his World Cup debut.\n\nHe was part of Mexico's squads at the 2006 and 2010 tournaments but did not get to feature at all.\n\nOchoa, whose nickname is \"Memo\", even earned some rare praise from Brazil's coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, who gave full credit to the Mexican custodian. \"He had a great day and that kept us from winning. He made some spectacular saves, he was the best player of the match,\" said Scolari.\n\nMexico coach Miguel Herrera would do well to keep his goalkeeper firmly grounded, with a final Group A game against Croatia next Monday where a win will ensure the Mexicans' safe passage into the second round.\n\nOchoa has a golden opportunity to cement his position as his country's undisputed No 1 shot-stopper. He has waited this long for his chance to shine on football's grandest stage, and he would be foolish to let it go, having endured a frustrating path during his career to get this far.\n\nBefore the start of this World Cup, few would have heard of the name Guillermo Ochoa. Today, he is known around the world as the man who stopped Brazil dead in their tracks on their home turf.\n\nThat line on his CV will probably be more than enough to see clubs from all over the world knocking on his door once this tournament is over.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Exporting firms, including Cargill, said they have had to hire trucks to transport their goods the full distance to Brazil's main soya exporting port of Santos. That has raised shipping costs by 10 to 12 per cent for those that normally use the waterway, and farmers are getting paid less for soyabeans as a result, said Edeon Vaz, logistics coordinator for Aprosoja, Brazil's largest soya lobby.\n\nBrazil is the world's top soyabean exporter, and will probably ship out 43 million tonnes this crop year.\n\nMr Vaz believes closing the stretch of waterway was unnecessary and Aprosoja wants the government to reduce electricity generation on the Tiete and increase it elsewhere. Torrential rain has fallen in Brazil's southern region in recent weeks, restocking hydroelectric reserves in areas that can ship surplus electricity to other regions.\n\n\"Logically, we need energy, but we have a super supply of water in Itaipu; we could reduce the water used in the dams on the Tiete,\" Mr Vaz said by phone from Brasilia.\n\nA press official for the Itaipu dam, Brazil's largest, said the Brazilian-Paraguayan agency that runs the dam has been building up water in its reservoir in order to have reserves on hand during the World Cup. Much of that water comes from the drier upper reaches of the Tiete-Parana waterway.\n\nReservoir levels in the south-east are expected to end June at just 36.4 per cent, barely over half their year-ago level and one of the lowest levels in 15 years. President Dilma Rousseff's government does not want to risk rationing in an election year. Two-thirds of Brazil's energy comes from hydro-power.\n\nMeanwhile the Tiete-Parana's maximum draft, or depth of a vessel's hull beneath the water, was just 0.5 metre in some places on Monday, far below the 2.2 metres needed for commercial navigation, the transportation secretariat at Sao Paulo state government said.\n\nLuiz Fernando Horta de Siqueira, head of the local barge owner's union, said the draft could be raised to navigable levels on the affected 8-10km stretch if the dams on the Tiete-Parana waterway well above Itaipu were allowed to rise.\n\nThe Tiete-Parana waterway transports eight million tonnes of cargo per year, including 2.5 million tonnes of soyabeans, corn and other soya derivatives. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Shipments to the United States tumbled 8.8 per cent after an 11.7 per cent jump the previous month.\n\nMeanwhile, the regional trade that has been propping up the local economy has also started to show signs of weakness. Non-oil re-exports, which go mostly to markets in the region, fell 4.7 per cent in May, reversing 13 straight months of growth.\n\nUOB Bank economists Francis Tan and Jimmy Koh said in a brief note that this was due partly to a high base in the same month last year. But Citigroup's Kit Wei Zheng thinks the growth momentum in the related wholesale trade was also waning.\n\nAmong its top 10 markets, domestic exports in May dropped in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Thailand. China, Malaysia and Indonesia were the only exceptions.\n\nProbably because of Thailand's political crisis, Singapore's NODX shipments to the country plunged 29 per cent last month - the steepest decline among the top 10 markets.\n\nNODX's disappointing showing in May came after private-sector economists, eyeing the recovery signs in the major economies, especially the US, had predicted an average 0.5 per cent on-year rise.\n\nMonth on month, NODX fell a seasonally adjusted 7.5 per cent in May, against a 9 per cent surge in April.\n\nThe economists had been looking at a 0.6 per cent increase. Disappointed, the UOB economists have downgraded their full-year NODX growth forecast from 7 per cent to 4 per cent - though this is still higher than the official forecast for one to 3 per cent growth.\n\nEconomists expect the electronics sector to be one of the biggest losers if Singapore fails to benefit from the projected recovery in the developed markets.\n\nElectronic NODX extended their decline for a 22nd consecutive month with a 15.3 per cent decline in May, after an 8.7 per cent fall in April. While Barclay's Wai Ho Leong reckons this was due more to the number of public holidays last month, especially in South Korea and Taiwan, he concedes that the drop was more pronounced than expected.\n\nPhilip McNicholas of BNP Paribas sees the electronics sector already in \"secular decline\", while the UOB economists indicate that its share of total NODX has fallen from half a decade ago to 28.7 per cent in the first five months of 2014.\n\nCitigroup's Mr Kit is worried that electronics NODX's under-performance against competitors in North Asia and South-east Asia may reflect Singapore's loss of competitive edge in exports.\n\nThe situation has been compounded by a drop in the non-electronics NODX, which dipped 2.4 per cent in May, against a 5.5 per cent jump in April.\n\nAll this does not augur well for the economy in coming months.\n\n\"At best, the latest data suggests trade-related sectors have yet to contribute meaningfully to sequential GDP growth in the second quarter - though we look to May's industrial production figures next week for confirmation,\" Mr Kit said.\n\nAdded Chua Hak Bin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch: \"Slowing non-oil exports and re-exports in recent months amid further tightening of foreign worker policy will likely mean both weaker manufacturing and services growth in the second quarter.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

BT understands that one tower will be branded Holiday Inn Express and the other, Hotel Indigo, a boutique hotel concept aligned with the local neighbourhood story.\n\nIf the MOU leads to management contracts being inked, this will be IHG's first Hotel Indigo in Singapore.\n\nThe site is near the East Coast-Joo Chiat road junction.\n\nIn January, a joint venture between Master Contract Services and Keong Hong Construction clinched the 99-year leasehold site at an Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) tender, for $352.8 million or $1,326.11 per square foot of potential gross floor area (GFA). Located next to the 112 Katong mall, the 88,678 sq ft site can have maximum GFA of about 266,041 sq ft. This includes around 13,132 sq ft in the former Joo Chiat Police Station at 86 East Coast Road, a two-storey building constructed in the 1920s and gazetted for conservation in 1993.\n\nURA has said that the building has to be restored as it is \"historically and architecturally significant\". Industry observers said that they would not be surprised if the former police station building is turned into a unique food and beverage (F&B) concept that could be operated by IHG given the building's prime location, fronting East Coast Road.\n\nIn addition to restoring the conservation building, Master Contract Services and Keong Hong are expected to build a retail podium along with the two hotel towers. The hotels could be ready around 2017, reckon some market watchers.\n\nWhen contacted, IHG would not confirm if an MOU has been inked, but Paul Logan, its senior vice-president, development, Asia Middle East and Africa, commented that \"Joo Chiat shows incredible promise as an area for hotel development\". \"It's got great heritage and character . . . and its proximity to the Paya Lebar commercial hub could see demand from both leisure and business travellers,\" he added.\n\nTalk in the market is that a potential Hotel Indigo on the Joo Chiat site could have about 250 rooms.\n\nIHG operates 57 Hotel Indigos worldwide, with another 52 in the pipeline. Currently there are five Hotel Indigos in Asia (all in China and Hong Kong). A property in Bangkok is due to open late this year along Wireless Road, while the group's first Hotel Indigo branded resort property in the world is scheduled to begin business on Bali Seminyak Beach next year.\n\nIf IHG proceeds to sign a management contract for a Holiday Inn Express at the Joo Chiat site, it could have around 300 rooms, according to word on the street. This will be the third Holiday Inn Express in Singapore - after the 221-room hotel along Bideford Road near Orchard Road (on the former Wellington Building site) that opened last year and the 442-room Holiday Inn Express Singapore Clarke Quay at Magazine Road which began trading in March this year. Holiday Inn Express is a limited services, mid-market brand.\n\nIHG currently operates six hotels in Singapore with a total room count of 2,218. Besides the two Holiday Inn Express properties, the others are the InterContinental Singapore at Bugis Junction, Crowne Plaza Changi Airport, Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre and Holiday Inn Singapore Atrium.\n\nMarket watchers expect Master Contract's development of the two hotels to further liven up the stretch of East Coast/Joo Chiat roads. Next door, on the site of the former GRTH Building, Oxley Holdings is building The Flow, where freehold strata retail units are said to have changed hands at between $3,564 psf and $5,798 psf over the past year. At 451 Joo Chiat Road, the former Katong Junction is expected to undergo a massive refurbishment starting early next year. The four-storey property will be repositioned as 57 strata units. These are likely to comprise F&B outlets and shop units on Level 1, shop units on Levels 2 and 3, and offices on Level 4. The freehold project is expected to be launched around September this year.\n\nBy the way, talk in the market is that Shangri-La group could be rebranding its Traders Hotel into a new concept, Hotel Jen. A new 500-room hotel to be managed by the group and which will open later this year on the former Hotel Phoenix site in the Orchard Road shopping belt will carry this name.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Gain will kick off from July.\n\nSaid CAG assistant vice-president (cargo and logistics development) James Fong: \"While the outlook for the global airfreight sector remains uncertain, we are committed to our airline partners in providing support where needed. We will work with them to explore new opportunities and respond to emerging industry trends so as to sustain growth over the long term for the airfreight sector.\"\n\nFor the period January to April, Changi handled 598,000 tonnes of airfreight, with growth remaining flat when compared to the same period last year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

All the better to vary your mortgage interest with, the salespeople say. But what consumers really need is not another twist to the floating-rate mortgage, but rather better fixed-coupon loans that are easy to account for in budgets and that protect against rising interest rates.\n\nDBS Bank has been making the headlines with its introduction of the \"fixed-deposit home rate\". The new benchmark is being marketed as an easy-to-understand alternative to the Singapore Interbank Offer Rates (Sibor). Whether that is actually the case is debatable.\n\nThe Sibor-setting process admittedly has serious flaws - banks around the world have been found to try to manipulate interbank rates, for example - but most of the time it serves its purpose adequately. Because the benchmark is so widely used, there is usually an incentive to be accurate - a rate that benefits one position could just as easily hurt another in the bank's books.\n\nFor all of Sibor's faults, though, it is not clear that basing loan rates on the bank's fixed-deposit interest is necessarily better for consumers. If Sibor is hard to understand, the mechanism for setting fixed-deposit rates is even more opaque.\n\nConsumers might be better served if the banks and regulators pour their resources into developing a greater variety of fixed-rate mortgages.\n\nBanks have long complained that lack of demand is the real culprit behind the market's lacklustre fixed-rate mortgage offerings. Demand is unlikely to be any better than it is now with prevailing interest rates near all-time lows. While rates are not expected to climb quickly over the next year, the outlook has nevertheless become brighter.\n\nFor a homebuyer, the higher risk is of rates and inflation rising faster than expected, making the stability of a fixed-rate loan more attractive at this time. Offering longer tenures could help improve take-up among borrowers. A quick check showed that the longest period for which a Singapore retail homebuyer can lock in a rate at the moment is five years. For serious buyers, who are in it for the long haul, five years does not offer much comfort. Friendlier early-payment terms would also help.\n\nRegulators can also help by looking to develop mortgage securitisation that could allow banks to share or transfer some of their risks. Helping to develop the fixed-rate mortgage market makes sense from a risk perspective; defaults are less of a problem when borrowers can budget for interest payments well into the future. Fixed-rate mortgages do not always offer the best deal, but homebuyers should have more viable options if they choose to go down that path.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A government minister said last week Egypt wants to be a \"global logistics hub\" for grain storage.\n\nHassan Falah, chairman of the Red Sea Ports Authority, said it had recently issued a tender to develop a wheat storage site with a capacity of two million tonnes at the port of Adabiya. He declined to disclose the value of the project. \"There are a number of Egyptian banks who are willing to fund the project with any investors and one of them is the National Bank of Egypt,\" Mr Falah said on a trade visit to Britain. \"In six months, the winner of the tender will be known.\"\n\nMr Falah said Adabiya would add to grain storage facilities at other ports in Damietta, along Egypt's Mediterranean coast, and Safaga, which is situated along the Red Sea. \"Adabiya is in the middle and it is preferred to shorten the distance and can serve cities and governorates in different areas,\" Mr Falah told Reuters.\n\nEgypt is also making progress in increasing local storage capacity with the help of one of its major Gulf Arab backers, the United Arab Emirates. The UAE has committed to funding the construction of 25 silos to boost storage capacity by a further 1.5 million tonnes.\n\nMr Falah said Port Tawfik, also situated in Suez and another terminal within his port authority, had issued a tender to develop a multi-purpose port there. \"In the pipeline and under study are expansion projects for yachts and cruise ships at the port,\" he added.\n\nAuthorities have mounted a crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood, once Egypt's most well organised Islamist group, and its supporters since Mr Mursi was deposed, killing hundreds and arresting thousands.\n\nMr al-Sisi still faces a violent threat from militants based in the Sinai peninsula, who are believed to have access to weapons smuggled from chaotic Libya.\n\nIn May, the army said it had seized 15 tonnes of a material used to make explosives in a town straddling the Suez Canal, a vital source of foreign exchange for Egypt and the fastest shipping route between Europe and Asia.\n\nMr Falah, who retired from the Egyptian navy as a rear admiral in 2007, said there were no security issues with Suez. \"There are multiple checkpoints throughout Suez. The Suez area is secure,\" he noted.\n\nMr al-Sisi's plans include creating a Central Sinai governorate, or administrative area, carved out of the North and South Sinai. North Sinai has seen countless militant attacks on policemen and soldiers since Mr Mursi's ouster. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The price of Brent had risen as much as 4 per cent from last week, although oil prices eased slightly yesterday after the US said it would send up to 275 troops to protect the US Embassy and other US interests.\n\n\"Of our Asian airlines coverage, we estimate Singapore Airlines is the least exposed - it has about half of its fuel requirements hedged,\" HSBC analysts Mark Webb and Rajani Khetan said in a report yesterday.\n\n\"Cathay Pacific is also well placed with 26 per cent of its 2014 fuel needs hedged,\" they added.\n\nOn the other hand, Air Asia X, Thai Airways and Cebu Pacific are among the Asian airlines that are the most exposed to increasing fuel costs.\n\nShares in SIA closed at $10.45 yesterday, down two cents. HSBC has a target price on the stock of $11.30, citing the carrier's strong branding, modern fleet, as well as its robust cash position.\n\nAt the same time, the local airline faces its own set of challenges. Yields are being pressured by a strong Singapore dollar as well as intensifying competition from the fast expanding Gulf and regional airlines.\n\nSIA posted a net profit of $27 million for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2014, down 60 per cent from a year earlier. For the full year, net profit slipped to $359.5 million from $378.9 million, dragged down by exceptional items and weaker share of results from associated companies.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Offerings this year include a record US$1.5 billion transaction linked to potential hurricane damage in Florida.\n\n\"Wind season looks to be slightly below average in terms of the hurricane outlook and that's attractive,\" John Brynjolfsson, chief investment officer at Irvine, California-based hedge fund Armored Wolf LLC, which oversees about US$700 million including the disaster-linked notes, referred to as cat bonds. \"Although cat bonds are relatively tight, on a comparative basis they look attractive to capital markets investors.\"\n\nCat bond yields have dropped to about 4.7 percentage points more than benchmark interest rates, the lowest second-quarter level since 2005 and down from 6.57 percentage points a year ago, according to John Seo, managing principal at Fermat Capital Management LLC. The Westport, Connecticut-based firm oversees US$4.5 billion, more than 90 per cent of which is invested in cat bonds.\n\n\"The hurricane does not know the rate that was charged for the hurricane policy, so it's not going to respond to how much you charge,\" Mr Buffett said at the Edison Electric Institute's annual convention in Las Vegas on June 9. \"And if you charge an inadequate premium, you will get creamed over time.\"\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts only one to two storms will escalate to major hurricanes during this year's season, which lasts from June to November, compared to a historic average of three major storms. A measure of loss probabilities for cat bonds issued this year averages 1.32 per cent, down from an average 1.95 per cent for securities sold in 2013, according to Steve Evans, Artemis's founder.\n\nCatastrophe bonds in the United States have returned 22 per cent the past two years, about the same gains delivered by junk-rated corporate notes, during a period that included the damage caused by superstorm Sandy that tore through the north-eastern US in October 2012.\n\n\"Some of the events that kind of captured headlines, such as superstorm Sandy, as devastating and headline-grabbing as they were, did not trigger any losses of note,\" Mr Brynjolfsson said. That has helped to \"reinforce the integrity of the modelling firms\", he said.\n\nInsurance companies and reinsurers typically sell cat bonds to help cover their most extreme risks, with the proceeds of the issues set aside and paid out in the event of a qualifying disaster. Buyers get a relatively high interest margin for holding the notes and risk forfeiting their entire investment if the securities are triggered before they mature.\n\nCatastrophe-bond investors haven't experience major losses on bonds since 2011, when damage caused by the earthquake in Japan that March caused US$300 million of losses for securities issued by Muteki Ltd that helped cover earthquake risks taken on by German reinsurer Munich Re.\n\nThe market's track record through the 2008 financial crisis and natural disasters of recent years is \"especially important for the key investors in the sector, which are pension funds, endowments and sovereign wealth funds\", said Michael Millette, global head of structure finance at New York-based Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\n\nDemand has \"grown steadily over the past four years\", with most funds typically allocating less than one per cent of their assets to cat bonds, he said.\n\nInvestors are willing to accept lower yields because they provide returns that aren't correlated with other asset classes such as equities.\n\n\"When you factor in that you can't find anything else that is non-correlating with a decent return, it's easy to see that cat bonds are still very attractive,\" Artemis's Mr Evans said from London.\n\nIn Florida, where state-run Citizens Property Insurance Corp issued a record US$1.5 billion sale in April, chief risk officer John Rollins said the insurer is seeing an increasingly diverse pool of investors.\n\nThe three-year floating-rate notes, with a spread of 750 basis points more than borrowing benchmarks was originally marketed for US$400 million, and attracted investors including \"a pension fund for Scottish miners, a mutual fund backed by Japanese middle class savers, a fund dedicated to managing royal assets\", Mr Rollins said from Tallahassee.\n\nMr Rollins said he saw no indication of \"limited demand\" even as new issuers are debuting on the market.\n\nThe Texas Windstorm Insurance Association announced an offering this month after contemplating the securities for three years, according to general manager John Polak.\n\nThree years ago, \"the terms and conditions associated with cat bonds weren't quite as attractive and competitive as they are today\", he said from Austin. Now, cat bonds are \"more mainstream\" and \"most importantly, pricing is at a point where it's a realistic consideration\" for the association.\n\nThe offering is expected to grow from the initially marketed US$300 million to US$400 million, according to Mr Polak.\n\nItalian insurer Assicurazioni Generali SpA, based in Trieste, also issued its first cat bond this year, 190 million euros (S$323 million) in floating rate notes at a spread of 225 basis point more than the London interbank offered rate, Bloomberg data show.\n\n\"I think there's kind a tipping point that has been passed,\" Citizens' Mr Rollins said. \"If we have significant weather activity, if we have some bond get triggered, I think there will be recalibration mostly in the area of price, but not in the unwinding of structures. I don't anticipate that a test of these structures will not be passed.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": []}

This is up from 28.9 per cent in H1 2014 and 15.1 per cent in H2 2013. The recent low was 8.6 per cent in H1 2012.\n\nCentral Region comprises Core Central Region (CCR) and Rest of Central Region (RCR).\n\n\"The sale and development of residential sites in the Central Region,\" said a spokeswoman for the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), \"will provide more housing options nearer to employment centres within the Central Area.\n\n\"Overall, there is still a good distribution of residential sites across the regions to provide different housing choices.\"\n\nCentral Area includes the financial district and the Orchard Road shopping belt.\n\nSome market watchers noted that while the planning authority has been pushing for decentralisation in recent years - to move jobs to locations such as Tampines, Jurong East and Woodlands - it probably deems it timely now to also bring homes closer to jobs in the city. Both strategies are aimed at cutting the commute between home and work, easing pressure on the strained transport infrastructure.\n\nDTZ's SE Asia chief operating officer Ong Choon Fah said: \"We've been focusing a lot on suburban areas, so now they're trying to provide a balance. With more private homes in Central Region, people won't have to travel that far to go to work. Now in the city, you can find more amenities, night life, green space. This makes it a lot more liveable.\"\n\nKnight Frank chairman Tan Tiong Cheng noted that the heavy weightage of suburban or Outside Central Region (OCR) supply previously was to cater to strong upgrader demand from families living in HDB flats, as typically they can afford only OCR properties. \"However, as supply of new BTO (build to order) HDB flats from government is adequate for first-time home buyers now, demand for resale HDB flats has softened. This weakens upgrader buying of suburban private condos. Hence it is timely now to reduce the proportion of OCR supply on the GLS confirmed list,\" argued Mr Tan.\n\nAgreeing, Savills Singapore research head Alan Cheong said the higher OCR quotient for private housing supply in the GLS slate previously was part of a broader government strategy to \"play catch-up with an undersupply of residential properties in both public and private segments for the masses due to the population increase\". \"With the deficit bridged, URA is returning to usual planning norms,\" he added.\n\nSome observers also reason that with a more stable property market now and bigger price drops in CCR and RCR compared with OCR, the timing is better to increase the Central Region's share of private housing supply. Had the authorities released more prime sites earlier during the market euphoria, there would have been a danger of bullish land bids sparking another round of\n\nprice increases.\n\nThe CCR comprises postal districts 9, 10 and 11, the Downtown Core Planning Area (including the financial district) and Sentosa. RCR covers city-fringe locations such as Bukit Merah, Toa Payoh, Geylang, Sims Avenue and Paya Lebar Road.\n\nOn the H2 2014 confirmed list, a commercial and residential site near Holland Village MRT Station to be launched in December is expected to generate some 580 private homes. Those who will live in these homes would be close to employment centres such as one-north or Orchard Road. Similarly those who will reside in the 440 private homes expected on the Paya Lebar Road/Sims Avenue commercial site to be launched in October would be closer to workplaces in say Bugis, Beach Road and other parts of the CBD - compared with those living in say Yishun or Changi.\n\nSavills' Mr Cheong said that there is a limit to the authorities upping the ratio of private housing supply in Central Region. He expects land prices to remain firm due to competition for a limited number of GLS sites and the enlarged pool of bidders in recent years. \"Assuming land prices stay high, developers will try to sell mainly small units to keep lumpsum price affordable for buyers, who need to meet the TDSR (total debt servicing ratio) cap.\n\n\"Small units cater to a niche market: single/young couple end-users and investors looking to rent to single expats.\n\n\"To meet the needs of the majority buyer profile, ie families/upgraders, OCR will continue to be the mainstay of housing supply.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The valve provides oil flow to the engine bearing compartments.\n\nNews of the engine issue came just days after Frank Kendall, the Pentagon's chief arms buyer, said that the F-35 programme was making progress but more work was needed on developing the jet's software and improving its reliability.\n\nThe inspections were ordered after an F-35B model suffered an in-flight emergency on June 10 caused by oil loss in the jet's engine at a Marine Corps base in Yuma, Arizona, where issues have now been found with a total of three valves, Mr DellaVedova said.\n\nHe said that the pilot returned to base safely and there were no injuries.\n\nNo issues have been discovered at the other bases where F-35s are flown in California, Florida, Arizona and Maryland, he said.\n\nPratt & Whitney spokesman Matthew Bates said that the company was working closely with the Pentagon's F-35 programme office to determine the cause of the issue. He said that it took about 90 minutes to inspect each aircraft, and nearly all planes had been inspected and cleared for further flights.\n\nMr Bates said that the F135 engine had completed nearly 32,000 hours of combined ground and flight testing, with more than 16,000 logged in operational flights. Engine availability had remained steady at or above 98 per cent, he said.\n\nMr Bates also said that the engine was designed to survive significant damage from foreign objects as well as oil deprivation, and the control system for the engine included redundant mechanical and electronic parts.\n\nMr DellaVedova said the source of that F135 engine oil leak appeared to be a supply line to engine bearings and a fitting that separated from the body of the valve in question.\n\nIt was not clear if the issue was maintenance related. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

They are making a concerted effort to be attractive places to work and this is clearly producing positive results in the workplace,\" said George McFerran, eFinancialCareers sales and marketing director.\n\nA majority of respondents have worked between five and nine years in a financial services-related position and are aged between 25 and 54 years.\n\n\"Banks have put in massive efforts to retain top talent and make it easier to recruit ... so people are happy where they are, but open to further opportunities,\" said Neil Clark, eFinancialCareers director.\n\nWhich is why staff retention remains a challenge. Four in 10 (41 per cent) are actively seeking a new employer and over half (52 per cent) while not actively looking are open to new opportunities.\n\nOnly seven want to stay put.\n\nWhy do these people, who are relatively well paid and happy at work, want to change jobs?\n\n\"It is very normal for ambitious people to be open to job opportunities; this has always been the way,\" said Mr McFerran.\n\nAnd, the tight job market and the internet makes it easier to job hop.\n\nFinance professionals today are able to develop and interact with far wider networks more efficiently than ever before, he said.\n\n\"This enables them to actively manage and develop their career with a far greater degree of control than was previously possible.\"\n\nHe added: \"This pre-sents financial services organisations with both an opportunity in attracting top talent but also a threat when it comes to retaining the talent they already have.\"\n\nThose looking to move demand at least a salary raise from a new employer of 20-29 per cent.\n\nThe number of respondents looking for this level of pay increase is up by 9 per cent from last year.\n\nEmployers of choice in Singapore are Goldman Sachs, followed by JP Morgan and DBS, the survey found.\n\nThe most common factor behind the choice was company reputation (36 per cent) followed by perceived career prospects (26 per cent).\n\neFinancialCareers polled nearly 8,761 finance professionals globally (UK, US, China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, France, Germany and the Middle East), of which 1,142 work here.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The system, known as the Ram Air Turbine (RAT), is used to generate electricity and hydraulic pressure to ensure pilots can control the plane even if both engines fail. As a result of the test failure, the RAT has \"a possibility of failing prematurely\", Boeing said.\n\nGiven the \"very low likelihood\" of failure, the FAA granted an exemption for a limited time, Boeing said.\n\nSimilarly, a cockpit knob that controls altitude can inadvertently be rotated when pressed. That could send the plane out of its air traffic control-approved altitude, unless the pilots notice. \"The limited time to detect the error causes a large reduction in safety margins, which is classified as 'hazardous',\" Boeing said.\n\nThe same design exists on the 787-8 and Boeing said it would develop a new knob design by May to make the part compliant with safety regulations, and then retrofit planes.\n\nBoeing said the risk of the parts is balanced by the need to avoid a hit to export sales, and by the improved fuel economy of the plane, equipped with Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines. Both \"will serve the public interest\", Boeing added. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

IMBX2014 is part of this year's CommunicAsia, EnterpriseIT and BroadcastAsia 2014 event organised by Singapore Exhibition Services.\n\nThe minister said that with the smart nation initiative, Singapore will build on the achievements of the intelligent Nation 2015 (iN2015) master plan. The Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) will strengthen the hard and soft infrastructure in a holistic manner.\n\nThis includes developing a Smart Nation Platform (SNP) as well as initiatives that improve soft infrastructure, such as creating standards for the Internet of Things@Home and building of talent in new areas like Games Science.\n\nDr Yaacob noted that a smart nation can become a reality only if there is a successful combination of policy, people and technology. \"A key component in our smart nation vision is the SNP. As part of the SNP, we will further our capabilities in pervasive connectivity, by building new infrastructure and common technical architecture to support an innovative ecosystem across Singapore.\"\n\nOn top of enhancing the existing connectivity in Singapore with technologies such as HetNet (Heterogeneous Network), the SNP will aim to bring together a nationwide sensor network and data analytics abilities, provide better situational awareness through data collection and efficient sharing of collected sensor data. HetNet allows for more optimal use of the wireless spectrum by allowing devices to switch seamlessly between various types of wireless networks.\n\nThe SNP will be developed in various phases, with the first phase (focusing on the connectivity and sensor aspects) expected to be available by 2015.\n\nJLD is one of the new growth areas identified in URA's Master Plan to support economic growth for the next 10-15 years, and to decentralise commercial activity from the city centre. IDA, in collaboration with the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), Economic Development Board (EDB) and other government agencies, has launched the Smart and Connected JLD Pilots and Trials initiative, which will test smart nation applications that improve the quality of life and enable sustainable use of resources. The initiative will be progressively deployed and trialed from the third quarter of this year.\n\nFifteen projects will be trialed, each giving a glimpse of what a smart nation could look like. More than 20 companies are involved in these trials and around 1,000 sensors will be deployed. Devices called Above Ground (AG) boxes will provide the connectivity to the sensors. These sensors will provide data for a wide variety of solutions, focusing on three main areas: urban mobility; sustainability; and improving sensing and situational awareness.\n\nThe AG boxes comprise a ready-built common infrastructure for sensor deployment and can supply points of access for fibre-optics connectivity and power.\n\nOne of the new services to be tried out will be a smart queue monitoring system that will use advanced video sensing to determine, in real time, the length and flow of queues in places like taxi stands, where the queue and taxi arrivals can be determined.\n\nOne possible use of the data could be at shopping centre taxi stands where information like potential wait times can be provided to consumers. The information could also be sent to taxi companies to alert them of taxi demand and busy stands so that they can direct nearby empty taxis there.\n\nAnother pilot is aimed at enhanced energy management. The project will enable buildings and public spaces to better monitor and benchmark energy consumption as well as track initiatives to reduce energy usage.\n\nNational University of Singapore (NUS) is developing a system which will determine vehicular and pedestrian movement, as well as queue length at traffic junctions using video sensing. This will provide a better estimate of congestion at traffic junctions. At each junction, this can enable real-time optimised traffic light signalling that will benefit both drivers and pedestrians.\n\nEach of the other projects aims to try out innovative services which make use of the huge amounts of real-time data that can be collected through the sensors connected to the integrated network.\n\nIDA executive deputy chairman Steve Leonard noted that Singapore has made great headway in just over a year from conceptualisation to real action in building Singapore as the world's first smart nation.\n\nHe said: \"One of the first building blocks for this vision to become reality is the development of SNP. It will serve as a foundation on which companies of all sizes, as well as government agencies, can experiment and innovate with new ways to collect, move and interpret data in order to better serve citizens. We welcome great ideas and input from across all communities and industries as we work to build Singapore into a smart nation.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Although the report does not implicitly say so, it showed that while Singapore continues to rely on piped natural gas (PNG) supplies from Indonesia and Malaysia last year, LNG has also started making an appearance.\n\nSingapore's total gas consumption last year was 10.5 billion cubic metres, with PNG imports accounting for 9.2 billion cu m. This meant that LNG imports - with the start-up of the Singapore LNG terminal last May - accounted for the remainder 1.3 billion cu m, or 12.4 per cent of total gas imports by Singapore last year.\n\nThe BP numbers, released this week, also showed a slight slowdown in PNG supplies here last year - with Indonesia piping 7.6 billion cu m and Malaysia another 1.6 billion cu m to Singapore. This is down from 7.9 billion cu m and 1.7 billion cu m respectively in 2012.\n\nOverall, consumption of both oil (up 1.1 per cent) and gas (up 12.3 per cent) rose last year from the previous year, in line with the 3.7 per cent growth in the economy. But the spike in gas consumption was due to new gas-fired combined cycle gas turbine plantings here by the gencos to capitalise on LNG availability.\n\nOn the oil refining front, crude oil imports fell 6 per cent to 892,000 barrels per day (bpd) last year from a year ago, as the three Singapore refineries - ExxonMobil, Shell and Singapore Refining Company (SRC) - continued to face intense competition because of global overcapacity.\n\nThe BP figures indicate that Singapore refiners reduced their crude throughput last year, especially with the Gulf producers continuing to pile on new capacity. Saudi Arabia added 18.9 per cent more refining capacity last year, with Iraq (8.3 per cent) and Iran (4.1 per cent) also increasing theirs. China added 5.6 per cent more refining capacity, while Indonesia increased its capacity by 3 per cent.\n\nDespite the heightened competition, Singapore's refining capacity stayed intact at 1.395 million bpd, whereas in Europe, Australia and Japan, the bleeding continued as refiners there closed older, less-efficient plants. What has helped in Singapore's case is refinery upgrading projects such as SRC's, as well as the integration of ExxonMobil and Shell's refineries with their value-add petrochemical complexes producing speciality chemicals.\n\nThe data also showed a turnaround in the oil trading scene here last year. There was a surprising 9 per cent rise in oil products traded last year compared with 2012. Singapore-based traders imported 2.125 million bpd and exported 1.692 million bpd of products last year, compared with 2.016 million bpd and 1.479 million bpd respectively in 2012. Australasia and China remained their main export destinations.\n\nRenewable energy use here - mainly solar power - remained the same, accounting for 0.3 million tonnes of oil equivalent last year. This was the same level since 2009.\n\nIt accounts for just 0.3 per cent of Singapore's total fuel consumption of 75.7 million tonnes of oil equivalent last year, with oil (65.9 million tonnes) accounting for 87 per cent and gas (9.5 million tonnes) for 12.5 per cent. Consumption of gas, however, has risen from 7.5 million tonnes of oil equivalent in 2012, while that of oil has dipped from 66.2 million tonnes previously.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG and Morgan Stanley have all moved from Central to the 118-floor International Commerce Centre in Kowloon in the last four years amid rising rents in Central.\n\nOwning the building outright will help Citi protect itself against Hong Kong's notoriously volatile property market, Citi Hong Kong chief executive Weber Lo said in an internal memo to staff.\n\n\"Our decision to purchase the East Tower of One Bay East underlines our belief and confidence in Hong Kong's continued growth as a leading global financial centre,\" said Stephen Bird, Citi's chief executive for Asia Pacific in a statement yesterday.\n\nHong Kong's government said on May 22 it had no intention of easing property cooling measures in the city, where prices have surged nearly 120 per cent since 2008 due to an ultra-low interest rate environment, tight supply and abundant liquidity.\n\nCiti will move into the new One Bay East building in the second half of 2016 following completion of construction in the third quarter of next year. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nLG Electronics shares jump on report of AI chip gear development\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:27 AM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nUS tariffs put spotlight on industrial S-Reits\u2019 upcoming H1 earnings\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM", "images": []}

Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the gain was the largest in almost three years.\n\nA pick-up in inflation lessens the threat of a prolonged drop in prices that hurts economic growth, giving Fed officials reason to continue to scale back their unprecedented bond-buying programme. Continued hiring and faster wage gains will be needed to boost demand and enable consumers to cope with higher prices.\n\n\"We expect inflation continuing to rise gradually,\" Neil Dutta, head of US economics at Renaissance Macro Research LLC in New York, said in a research note. \"By year's end, we suspect the Fed will acknowledge a neutral set of risks around the inflation outlook.\" Last month's increase in consumer prices exceeded all forecasts in the Bloomberg survey, which ranged from no change to a 0.3 per cent advance.\n\nCosts rose 2.1 per cent over the past 12 months, the most since October 2012, after a 2 per cent year-over-year gain in April.\n\nAnother report yesterday showed builders broke ground on one million homes in May, indicating the industry is picking up this quarter after a weather-induced slump to start the year.\n\nThe number of housing starts last month was in line with the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg and followed April's 1.07 million annualised rate that was the most since November, according to figures from the Commerce Department.\n\nThe Labour Department's inflation report showed that stripping out volatile food and fuel, the so-called core measure increased 0.3 per cent, the most since August 2011, and following a 0.2 per cent gain the prior month. Economists had forecast a 0.2 per cent advance, according to the survey median.\n\nThe core index increased 2 per cent from the same month in 2013 after a 1.8 per cent gain in April.\n\nThe Fed's 2 per cent goal is based on the Commerce Department's inflation gauge that is tied to consumer spending. That measure climbed 1.6 per cent in the 12 months through April, and May data are scheduled for release on June 26.\n\nEnergy costs increased 0.9 per cent from a month earlier, while food prices rose 0.5 per cent, the most since August 2011.\n\nFed officials led by chair Janet Yellen reiterated at their April meeting that long-term inflation expectations remain stable. The Fed's Open Market Committee was meeting yesterday and today in Washington.\n\nIn April, the Fed pared its monthly asset-buying to US$45 billion, its fourth straight US$10 billion cut, and said further reductions in \"measured steps\" are likely.\n\nThe CPI is the broadest of three price gauges from the Labour Department because it includes all goods and services. About 60 per cent of the index covers prices consumers pay for services from medical visits to airline fares, movie tickets and rents.\n\nWholesale prices decreased 0.2 per cent in May, data showed last week. Import prices rose 0.1 per cent last month following a 0.5 per cent decline in April, according to a separate report released on June 12. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

But before it began working for Valeant, Morgan Stanley tried to get hired by Allergan.\n\nAs part of its effort to secure a role advising Allergan, senior Morgan Stanley bankers emailed with the company's executives. Allergan did not wind up hiring Morgan Stanley, but on Monday, Allergan sought to use those emails against the investment bank.\n\nIn one email from Robert Kindler, vice-chairman and global head of mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley, to Allergan's chief executive, David E I Pyott, and its chief financial officer, Jeff Edwards, Mr Kindler appears to suggest that Allergan wage an attack on Valeant's business model and stock price.\n\n\"My takeaway is that AGN is not being nearly aggressive enough in going after the VRX business model and currency,\" Mr Kindler is said to have written on May 13.\n\nThat, of course, is exactly what Allergan has done over the past month, releasing a series of presentations that has put Valeant on the defensive and sent its stock price down.\n\nIn another email to Mr Edwards, David Horn, a Morgan Stanley health care banker, goes on to say that Mr Kindler's advice could help sway the debate in Allergan's favour.\n\n\"Part of what Rob (Kindler) is suggesting (to Allergan) is to allow him to use his significant relationships with media and analysts to provide a clear and detailed articulation of why Valeant is a house of cards and your investors should not want to take their stock,\" Mr Horn is said to have written on May 18.\n\nTogether, the publication of the emails in a news release amounts to an airing of dirty investment banking laundry, demonstrating that in a hostile bid some advisers will work for whichever side will hire them first.\n\nIn addition to the emails from Mr Kindler and Mr Horn, Allergan included quotes from other analysts and investors, casting doubt on Valeant's business model and the worth of its stock, which has fallen 5 per cent since the hostile bid began.\n\n\"There is a possibility that the whole Valeant exercise is something from the Wizard of Oz,\" wrote John Hempton, chief investment officer of Bronte Capital. \"Profits are going up nicely if you pay no attention to that man behind the curtain - the man being the large restructuring and one-time items.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the email news release is a desperate tactic on the part of Allergan - which remains under pressure from Valeant and its largest shareholder, Pershing Square Capital Management, to strike a deal - or whether Valeant is slowly losing the momentum for its bid.\n\nEither way, with Morgan Stanley having been hired by Valeant and not Allergan, it is now being paid to help a company that it privately referred to as \"a house of cards\" less than a month ago.\n\nValeant appeared unfazed.\n\n\"Mr Kindler is one of the best M&A bankers out there,\" Valeant's chief executive, J Michael Pearson, said in an email. \"While we will have some fun with him later, he's still very much on our team. It's clear that Allergan's release is a sign of desperation, and we look forward to proving the naysayers wrong.\" - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nLG Electronics shares jump on report of AI chip gear development\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:27 AM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nUS tariffs put spotlight on industrial S-Reits\u2019 upcoming H1 earnings\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM", "images": []}

This provides exactly that. They know exactly how much they're going to pay in the currency they want.\"\n\nAside from being able to deliver a better experience for its customers, this means reduced exposure to currency fluctuations for SIA.\n\nThe airline could also potentially drive some of its marketing efforts around the initiative, noted Mr Misra, adding that SIA could launch special packages aimed at frequent fliers while locking in a certain foreign-exchange rate for a specific span of time.\n\nSix currencies were introduced in the first phase in May - the Australian dollar, euro, pound, yen, Singapore dollar and the US dollar - although more currencies will be rolled out later this year.\n\nRBS also provides similar services to other airlines, such as AirAsia and Cathay Pacific, as well as to firms in other industries such as hospitality. Its FXmicropay platform processes millions of transactions globally each year.\n\nOver the next five years, RBS is planning to invest some \u00a37 billion (S$14.9 billion) towards IT infrastructure to better serve its clients.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The FHR is currently 0.40 per cent, based on DBS' 12-month FD rate of 0.25 per cent and 24-month FD rate of 0.55 per cent.\n\nDBS continues to sell loans pegged to Sibor (Singapore interbank offered rate), which are also the most popular home-loan product at other banks, but said that customers are receptive to its new FHR package.\n\n\"The response has been encouraging,\" said Lui Su Kian, DBS Bank's managing director and head of deposits and secured lending.\n\nMore than half of home buyers who opt for floating rates have taken up the FHR package since it was launched two to three months ago, she said. The others continue to go for Sibor. The rest of the borrowers go for the bank's fixed rate packages, she said.\n\nThe FHR is an easy to understand and transparent pricing product, she added. \"Most consumers lean towards Sibor rates - they want something simple and easy to understand.\"\n\nSibor rates, which are wholesale rates, can be accessed easily. They are administered by the Association of Banks in Singapore.\n\nMs Lui noted that Sibor formulas are quite technical.\n\nWill the new product improve DBS' margins?\n\n\"The outcome we'd like to see is . . . that margins are stable and keep inching up,\" Ms Lui said.\n\nSome bankers note that Sibor rates being wholesale prices are more volatile.\n\nOver the past 24 months, there has been some volatility in the three-month Sibor which is the most popular tenor for home loans. It's ranged from a low of 0.37083 per cent to a high of 0.40626 per cent; it's presently at 0.40376 per cent.\n\nThe last time DBS adjusted its 12-month and 24-month fixed deposit rates was in 2012, said Ms Lui.\n\n\"The popularity of interbank rates is a clear indicator that consumers desire transparency especially for large financial commitments such as mortgages,\" she said.\n\nHowever, interbank rates such as Sibor have been known to fluctuate while fixed deposit rates are less volatile, she said. \"Hence, FHR will appeal to home buyers who wish to take advantage of the low interest environment and yet have some protection from market movement.\"\n\nRival banks are sticking to Sibor-pegged home-loan packages, noting its transparency.\n\nSaid Dennis Khoo, United Overseas Bank's Singapore head, personal financial services: \"Home loans pegged to Sibor allow home buyers to capitalise on the current low interest rate, but the rate will vary along with interest rates movements.\"\n\n\"Likewise, home loans pegged to fixed deposit rates will be impacted by interest rates movements.\n\n\"Most customers prefer Sibor-pegged packages due to its open and transparent concept. It is determined by the banks in Singapore and published by the Association of Banks in Singapore,\" said Phang Lah Hwa, OCBC Bank head of consumer secured lending.\n\nThe stability of Sibor in recent years has also contributed to the popularity of these packages, said Ms Phang.\n\nOur experience shows that most of the customers who take up our mortgages prefer an index-linked package as we offer the widest range of Sibor indices, said Peng Chun Hsien, Citibank Singapore head of secured finance and e-business.\n\nWe also allow customers to switch Sibor any time during their home-loan tenure with 30 days' notice or on the Sibor expiry date, said Mr Peng.\n\nThis flexibility adds to the attractiveness of our offering, he said.\n\n\"We believe that being pegged to fixed deposit rates does have some inflexibility for the customers who may have to stay within an agreed rate for a fixed period of time,\" said Mr Peng.\n\nThough interest rates have been low for several years, they are forecast to start rising next year when US rates do so in response to improving economic conditions.\n\nBorrowers should realise that when interest rates move, the movements can be steep, up or down.\n\nIn August 2011, Swap Offer Rates (SORs) briefly turned negative and borrowers thought they would benefit, that is, banks would pay them instead.

That does not mean that they want to pay it. To reduce the tax pinch, the Clintons are using financial planning strategies befitting the top one per cent of US households in wealth. These moves, common among multimillionaires, will help shield some of their estate from the tax that now tops out at 40 per cent of assets upon death.\n\nThe Clintons created residence trusts in 2010 and shifted ownership of their New York house into them in 2011, according to federal financial disclosures and local property records.\n\nAmong the tax advantages of such trusts is that any appreciation in the house's value can happen outside their taxable estate. The move could save the Clintons hundreds of thousands of dollars in estate taxes, said David Scott Sloan, a partner at Holland & Knight LLP in Boston.\n\n\"The goal is really be thoughtful and try to build up the nontaxable estate, and that's really what this is,\" Mr Sloan said. \"You're creating things that are going to be on the nontaxable side of the balance sheet when they die.\"\n\nThe Clintons' finances are receiving attention as Mrs Clinton tours the country promoting her book, Hard Choices. She said in an interview on ABC television that the couple was \"dead broke\" and in debt when they left the White House in early 2001. After being criticised for her comments, she told ABC's Good Morning America that she understood the financial struggles of Americans.\n\nHaving lost the Democratic presidential nomination to Barack Obama in 2008, Mrs Clinton is now deciding whether to run again in 2016.\n\nIn her last campaign, Mrs Clinton supported making wealthier people pay more estate tax by capping the per-person exemption at US$3.5 million and setting the top rate at 45 per cent, a policy that Mr Obama still supports. Congress decided to go in the other direction, and Mr Obama went along as part of a broader compromise. The per-person exemption is now US$5.34 million.\n\n\"The estate tax has been historically part of our very fundamental belief that we should have a meritocracy,\" Mrs Clinton said at a December 2007 appearance with billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who supports estate taxes and is using charitable donations to reduce his eventual bill.\n\nWithout the estate tax, Mrs Clinton said, the country could become \"dominated by inherited wealth\". Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Mrs Clinton, said in an e-mail that the couple's finances are an \"open book\". He did not answer additional questions about their finances or her current views on the estate tax.\n\nTwo estate-planning advisers are listed on the Westchester County documents, Linda Hirschson of Greenberg Traurig LLP in New York and Rorrie Gregorio of Marcum LLP in New York. Both specialise in estate and tax planning for high-net-worth families; neither returned a call for comment.\n\nMoving up\n\nThe Clintons have consistently supported higher taxes on the income and estates of the wealthiest Americans, even as their paid speeches and book royalties moved them into the echelons of the nation's top earners over the past decade.\n\nAt the end of 2012, the Clintons were worth US$5.2 million to US$25.5 million, according to financial disclosures that Mrs Clinton filed in 2013 as she was leaving her position as secretary of state.\n\nThat total excludes the value of their homes in Washington and in Chappaqua, New York, any savings since 2012 and gifts already made to their daughter, Chelsea, who is expecting their first grandchild later this year.\n\nUnder federal disclosure rules for administration officials, the Clintons provided their net worth in a broad range. Most of the assets reported were in a single cash account at JPMorgan Chase & Co that held between US$5 million and US$25 million. As at 2010, they had two JPMorgan accounts, indicating a net worth of as much as US$50 million.\n\nSince she left the government last year, Mrs Clinton, 66, has been giving speeches for hundreds of thousands of dollars each. Mr Clinton, 67, also makes paid speeches and appearances, receiving US$200,000 each in October 2012 from Vanguard Group Inc and Deutsche Bank AG, according to Mrs Clinton's disclosures.\n\nAs president in 2000, Mr Clinton vetoed a proposal to repeal the estate tax, though he backed less significant changes to cushion family-owned businesses and farms against the potential effects of the tax.\n\n\"If you're serious about wanting to deal with the problems that estate tax presents, let's get after it and solve them,\" he said on Aug 31, 2000. \"But we have to proceed on grounds of fiscal responsibility and fairness.\"\n\nHis successor, George W Bush, signed a law that narrowed the estate tax and eliminated it for 2010 only. That law was set to expire on Dec 31, 2010. Unless Congress acted, the rate was scheduled to rise and the exemption was scheduled to drop.\n\nAt the end of 2010, Congress set the lifetime exemption from the gift tax for each individual at US$5 million, up from US$1 million. Lawmakers also unified that exemption with the estate tax, so that gifts made while alive counted towards the estate tax exemption at death. Those rules were scheduled to expire at the end of 2012, offering what looked like a one-time chance to use up the exemption with gifts - even if tax policy later swung in the other direction.\n\nInto trusts\n\nIn 2011 and 2012, many high-net-worth families moved money out of estates and into trusts to take advantage of the more favourable rules.\n\nUS taxpayers reported making US$122 billion in nontaxable gifts on the returns that they filed in 2012, more than four times the amount in each of the two previous years, according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nIn January 2013, Congress removed the expiration date from the higher exemption and kept indexing it for inflation. It is now US$5.34 million per person and US$10.68 million per married couple. Just 3,700 estates will owe estate taxes this year, equalling 0.14 per cent of people who will die, according to estimates by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group in Washington.\n\nBy making gifts during their lifetime, people take advantage of their estate tax exemptions in an orderly way, using techniques to stuff as many assets as possible into the nontaxable portion of the estate.\n\nThat appears to be what the Clintons did, Mr Sloan said, using a structure known as a qualified personal residence trust that allows them to discount the value of their house for estate tax purposes.\n\n\"You try to do things that can reduce the value of what you've given,\" he said.\n\nAccording to county property records, the Clintons split their ownership of the house into separate 50 per cent shares, and then placed those shares into trusts.\n\nThat manoeuvre has multiple potential benefits, starting with the fact that any appreciation in the house's value will now happen outside the estate. Additionally, using IRS interest rates, they can assume a discounted value for the house. Splitting the property into 50 per cent shares also allows a valuation discount, because a partial interest in an indivisible house is not worth as much as a complete interest.\n\nTax returns\n\nIt is impossible to know what value the Clintons claimed for the house without seeing their gift-tax return. They last released tax returns during Mrs Clinton's presidential campaign.\n\nThey bought the house for US$1.7 million in 1999. Its estimated value for local property tax purposes is US$1.8 million. Their house in Washington is valued at US$5 million for local tax purposes.\n\nResidence trusts have a set term after which the property is transferred to a beneficiary. Following that, the Clintons could pay rent to the new owner to continue living in the house, which is another way to move assets outside the estate.\n\nFor the asset to move completely outside the estate, the Clintons would have to outlive the term of the trust. Such trusts typically last for 10 to 15 years to maximise the discount applied to the property's value.\n\nCreating two separate trusts allows the Clintons to spread risk. They can set different lengths for each trust and if one of them dies, the other's trust would not be affected.\n\nAlso in 2010, the Clintons created a life insurance trust. That can help defray the cost of estate taxes, Mr Sloan said. They have had a separate life insurance trust since 1996, according to the disclosure records.\n\nThese moves are \"pretty standard\" planning for people who know that they will be subject to the estate tax, said Ken Brier, an estate tax lawyer in Needham, Massachusetts.\n\n\"If you're the Clintons and you live in a fishbowl,\" he said, \"you're not going to push the envelope in doing cutting-edge planning.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": []}

Each unit represents 50 minutes of outgoing local calls, 500 SMSes and MMSes or 0.5GB of local data usage.\n\nCustomers can mix and match these various components of usage, subject to a minimum of one unit for each service; this ensures that incoming calls as well as text and data messages come through.\n\nA customer who goes with a \"medium\" plan, for example, has 10 units to play around with. Two units can perhaps be allocated to voice service for 100 minutes of calls; another two units can be given over to the SMS service for 1,000 messages, and the remaining six units, for three gigabytes of data. This allocation can be changed in the following month, with the next billing cycle.\n\nThis flexibility can prove worthwhile for customers if they play their cards right.\n\nFor example, someone who wants to follow the earlier suggested use of 10 units under Easy Mobile's \"medium\" plan will find it cheaper to go with it than to stick with the existing Lite plan, which is most comparable.\n\nA calculation by The Business Times indicated that the top-up amount for more data and messages that the Lite plan does not provide will make it the more expensive option overall.\n\nSubsidies for handsets tagged to existing plans will also be available for comparative Easy Mobile plans, Yuen Kuan Moon, SingTel's chief executive officer of the consumer unit in Singapore, told reporters yesterday.\n\nHe estimates 20-30 per cent of customers could be interested in tweaking their plans, but gave no targets for the number of customers SingTel hopes to attract with this offering.\n\nThe service is available to new SingTel subscribers for now; existing SingTel customers will be able to renew their contracts with Easy Mobile plans in the coming months.\n\nAnalysts said the move is likely aimed at client retention and in attracting new customers, particularly because it has become easier for customers to vote with their feet.\n\nClement Teo, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, said: \"It brings a smile to the customer - the idea that 'SingTel now looks after me'.\"\n\nAshadi Cahyadi, a senior research manager for the telecoms industry at IDC Asia-Pacific, pointed out that there was now an urgency for a \"breakthrough\" in customer retention strategies, given the maturity and saturation of the telco market here.\n\nNotably, Easy Mobile will provide customers with updated data analysis, so they can decide whether they should stay with their traditional contract data plan or change to the on-the-go one, he said.\n\n\"This solution will bring competition between mobile operators to another level.\"\n\nStarHub does not rule out launching new mobile plans if there is market demand, said Michael Chang, StarHub's assistant vice-president of the mobility unit.\n\nA spokesman for M1 said M1 will continue to review its range of mobile plans, and pointed out that M1 was the first in 2008 to let its customers design their mobile plan with their preferred combination of voice, messaging, data and other value-added services.\n\nIn the US, similar services have looser restrictions around their customisable mobile plans. Some let the customer adjust their usage at any time and offer credits in the following month's plan for under-utilised portions of the customised plan.\n\nIn comparison, SingTel customers are somewhat bound to the Easy Mobile plan they choose, and must pay a one-off charge if they decide to switch to a cheaper customisable plan.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For China, in the same year, it was $117.6 billion, down 3 per cent.\n\nAnd \"more of the same\" trend is expected in 2014, says John Kurtz, AT Kearney's Asia-Pacific leader.\n\nSingapore, which accounted for a big chunk of the Asean investments, slipped from 7th in 2012 to 10th in 2013 in the FDI Confidence Index rankings. In bouncing back to 9th position in 2014, AT Kearney pointed to Singapore's \"famously predictable regulations, a relatively low corporate tax rate and an ample supply of qualified workers\".\n\nIt also noted that Singapore is a favourite regional headquarters and R&D centre for many multinationals - a role that's likely to expand further when the Asean Economic Community is formed next year.\n\nMalaysia, another Asean-5 country, made an even bigger recovery to jump from 25th to 15th in the rankings. It was in the 10th position in 2012.\n\nAT Kearney attributed Malaysia's better showing to \"strong inbound regional FDI flows and good performance in financial services, heavy industry and primary industry\".\n\nOnly three Asean countries made it to the 2014 FDI Confidence Index rankings. The third, Indonesia, barely made it.\n\nAfter seeing FDI hit a new high of US$19.9 billion in 2012, Indonesia drops one spot to 25th in the latest rankings. This is because its \"regulatory environment jeopardises the country's) investment climate\".\n\n\"A hotly contested ban on unprocessed mineral exports went into effect in January 2014, but the full details of last-minute compromise and carve-outs continue to cause confusion in the country's mining sector, a major source of revenue,\" AT Kearney said.\n\nWhile business leaders are more bullish about the global outlook - and large companies are sitting on a huge pile of cash - Singapore and its fellow Asean members can't assume that foreign investments will rush in simply because they will have a bigger market. Asean not only has other emerging-market competitors to reckon with; it also have the developed ones to deal with.\n\nThe latter, including economies from fiscally-challenged Europe, still occupy over half of the top 10 rankings in the Index. The United States, which retains the top spot, is in the strongest position since the rankings started in 1998.\n\n\"A full 49 per cent of respondents - compared to 39 per cent in 2013 and 23 per cent in 2007 - indicated that their outlook for the US is significantly more positive now than it was two years ago,\" AT Kearney said. Only 6 per cent expected the outlook to be more negative.\n\n\"The message is crystal clear: the US is back in the minds of global business leaders as the prime destination for their investment,\" it concluded. \"Never in the 16-year history of this index has a country had such a positive net position (43 per cent).\"\n\nIn comparison, 33 per cent of the respondents saw a more positive outlook for Singapore and 10 per cent a more negative outlook.\n\nAT Kearney noted that the latest rankings show a strong shift to OECD economies. Last year, OECD members represented 13 of the top 25 destination for direct investments; this year the number jumped to 17.\n\nWhile there are concerns about the fragile state of some emerging economies, AT Kearney said the rankings reveal that a core group of developing markets continues to enjoy widespread confidence among foreign investors. This include China in second placing, Brazil in 5th and India in 7th in the rankings.\n\nOther emerging markets are also among the top 25: United Arab Emirates (11th), Mexico (12th) and South Africa (13th).\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Nato had no immediate comment.\n\nA spokesman for German Air Traffic Control said: \"Planes disappeared from screens for a matter of seconds, here and there. The outages were sporadic and not grave.\"\n\n\"It must have been an external source of disruption. We are trying to identify the cause,\" the spokesman added.\n\nNato, in response to a request for comment, said it did carry out some training that involved \"localised and low-power jamming\" in the skies over Hungary during the June 2-6 period and that it was currently conducting similar training in southern Italy from June 9-20.\n\nHowever, it said no jamming was conducted on June 5. \"Our assessment is that Nato did not cause any interference with civilian air traffic control frequencies.

Meanwhile, the number of passengers carried edged up 3.5 per cent to 1.52 million.\n\nWith the exception of East Asia, PLF was up across all route regions. The carrier said that Europe and the South-west Pacific \"absorbed capacity injection well\", with PLF up 1.1 percentage points to 76.9 per cent and up 2.6 percentage points to 73.9 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, loads to the Americas and West Asia & Africa climbed 0.4 percentage point to 82.5 per cent and 1.4 percentage points to 73.3 per cent, respectively.\n\nEast Asia saw travel demand dragged down by the ongoing political tensions in Thailand, causing load factor to slip 1.2 percentage points to 70.3 per cent.\n\nRegional wing SilkAir reported a 1.3 per cent increase in passenger carriage against a 1.1 per cent capacity expansion, causing PLF to inch up 0.2 percentage point to 66.4 per cent. PLF for East Asia & the Pacific increased half a percentage point to 63.4 per cent while the PLF for West Asia was up 0.2 percentage point at 75.1 per cent.\n\nSIA Cargo managed to turn in a 0.9 percentage point rise in cargo load factor to 62.9 per cent, as capacity was scaled back 1.6 per cent and cargo traffic (in freight-tonne-kilometres) remained nearly flat. Load factors were up for most regions except the South-west Pacific where load factor shed 7.1 percentage points to 53.9 per cent owing to weak cargo traffic and capacity increases.\n\n\"The operating environment continues to remain challenging,\" SIA said in a release to the Singapore Exchange yesterday. \"Capacity will continue to be adjusted accordingly to better match market demand and promotional activities shall continue in markets that require additional support.\"\n\nShares in SIA closed at $10.47 yesterday, up six cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Under their proposal, they would merge their steam-turbine businesses with those of Alstom, but the real prize would be access to Alstom's clients across Europe.\n\nThe Japanese firms, which have little presence in the region, want to sell them other technologies such as clean-coal power stations and nuclear equipment.\n\nSiemens was scheduled to present an offer by yesterday, ahead of a June 23 cut-off date set by General Electric (GE) for its own 12.4 billion euro (S$21 billion) bid for all of Alstom's energy arm, which includes its thermal power, renewable power and grid businesses.\n\nMr Miyanagi is also in Paris to present the offer, according to sources.\n\nMitsubishi Heavy said in a statement yesterday that various options were being considered, but a decision had not been made.\n\nSiemens and Mitsubishi are including a cash element of roughly nine billion euros, according to sources close to the bidders. Tying up with Alstom would give Mitsubishi Heavy access to European markets, said Tom O'Sullivan, founder of independent energy consultancy Mathyos Japan.\n\n\"They are weak in Europe, but strong in Asia,\" Mr O'Sullivan said. \"This would give them access to Alstom's clients.\"\n\nAlstom's steam turbines account for more than 20 per cent of global installed capacity, according to the French company's website. More than 30 per cent of nuclear power stations use Alstom steam turbines, the website says.\n\nMitsubishi Heavy recently completed a tie-up with Hitachi that put their thermal power business together in a bid to secure more global contracts. Hitachi is planning the construction of new nuclear reactors in the UK after buying the Horizon nuclear power project from E.On and RWE.\n\nAs the race to acquire Alstom power business enters a crucial week, Mitsubishi Heavy's move ties in with the push by Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for more exports of Japanese coal technology and nuclear equipment to boost growth.\n\nAlstom is privately owned, but the French government has taken an active role in the talks. It views the group's transport and energy activities, notably in nuclear power, as strategic and is keen to preserve jobs with unemployment stuck above 10 per cent.\n\nThe French government has already secured a pledge from GE to create 1,000 new jobs in France within three years of a deal.\n\nMitsubishi and the French state would take equal stakes in Alstom, acquiring part of the 29 per cent holding of French group Bouygues, union representatives said after meeting French Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg. This could involve French state bank BPI acquiring a stake in Alstom alongside Mitsubishi, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. A source familiar with the situation said BPI was \"ready to be involved in any scenario\", including with Mitsubishi or GE.\n\nA Bouygues spokesman said the group had not been approached by any party regarding a sale of its stake in Alstom, adding: \"Bouygues wishes to remain a long-term shareholder in Alstom with a 29.3 per cent stake.\"\n\nIn a second step separate to a turbine deal, Siemens is also proposing to combine its rail activities with Alstom's, sources said. The French government has actively lobbied for this, saying it would create a European rail champion. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nLG Electronics shares jump on report of AI chip gear development\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:27 AM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nUS tariffs put spotlight on industrial S-Reits\u2019 upcoming H1 earnings\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM", "images": []}

We have many customers telling us 'this aircraft is excellent, please try to also reduce the fuel burn with new engines',\" Mr Bregier told reporters. \"So we are looking at that, we are not rushing. We will take the decision this year. It's not limited to putting new engines on; it's more complicated than that.\"\n\nAirbus faces a drop in orders for the 20-year-old A330 from 2016 as attention switches to the newer Boeing 787, but appears progressively more confident about being able to preserve its wide-body \"cash cow\" with improvements in fuel efficiency.\n\nThe move depends on a jigsaw of decisions including the outcome of talks with engine manufacturers General Electric and Rolls-Royce and a debate about whether the market is big enough to support more than one choice of engine.\n\nIt must also weigh the fuel savings provided by newer - but larger - engines against their increased weight and drag.\n\nAirbus says it can compete with the newer plane because of factors such as cheaper maintenance and a lower price for the A330 and has clashed with Boeing over which plane is lighter.\n\nIt said strong sales had surprised even its own experts.\n\n\"The 787 promised the world an awful lot but in spite of all the promises it made, airlines have found that the A330 still has a lot to deliver,\" said executive vice-president Kiran Rao.\n\nBoeing has dismissed the A330 revamp as a distraction from the 787's innovations but has pledged to \"react\" in a sign that it may be tempted to shift its pricing strategy.\n\nAirbus insisted it was looking at more than a brief stopgap.\n\n\"I wouldn't be interested in doing a short-term programme for only 4-5 years; it has got to be an aircraft that would be powerful enough in the market place until the end of the next decade,\" said executive vice-president programmes Tom Williams.\n\nThe A330 review comes as Airbus looks beyond the entry into service of its brand-new A350, which it expects in December as scheduled, to the production ramp-up needed to reach a longer-term target of making the jet profitable by 2019.\n\nSuch plans, calling for a rapid increase in output, have little margin for error and can quickly drive up costs.\n\nMr Bregier, who has made avoiding the delays and cost overruns that beset the rival Boeing 787 Dreamliner his chief priority, said the A350 would prove itself financially and downplayed the impact of a major order cancellation this week.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we are looking at profitability,\" Mr Bregier said. \"We believe that at the end of the decade we will have not only the A320, the A330, but also the A350 very profitable. On the A380 our goal is to break even. If we have that, the financial challenges that you know for Airbus will be met.\"\n\nSome analysts have expressed concerns over the strategy for the aircraft after Emirates cancelled 70 orders for aeroplanes.\n\nRating agency Moody's said the cancellation was \"credit negative\" for Airbus Group and \"credit positive\" for Boeing.\n\nMr Bregier meanwhile held out the prospect that Airbus would continue to increase production of smaller narrowbody A320-family jets if the market called for it.\n\nAirbus and Boeing are producing narrowbody jets at record rates and have suggested they could go higher from around 2018.\n\n\"There is no industrial limit. Conversely, I don't want to build extra capacity and not be able to make the best use of my cash,\" Mr Bregier said during an annual media seminar.\n\nAirbus said it had found signs of fatigue on fewer than 10 per cent of doors inspected on the A380 after a number of reports of noise, but that there was no immediate safety issue.\n\nOn Jan 4, a Singapore Airlines A380 carrying 494 people made an emergency landing in Baku, Azerbaijan after problems with the door seal led to oxygen masks being deployed. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The fact that it helped Holland spark a remarkable 5-1 comeback victory over defending champions Spain made it that much sweeter.\n\nNot even Nostradamus himself could have possibly imagined such a result - well, except for at least one punter in Singapore, that is.\n\nA photo of a Singapore Pools betting slip has been making the rounds online, showing a $10 bet for Holland to beat Spain by that exact scoreline at odds of 300-to-1, resulting in a $3,000 windfall.\n\nAll this, and there's still 28 more days of The Beautiful Game to enjoy. Sleep at your peril, for it could mean missing out on witnessing history in the making.\n\nSure, the matches kick off at very unfriendly hours in Singapore, but rarely has a World Cup provided so many talking points in the first week alone.\n\nThe tournament was barely nine minutes old last Thursday when Brazilian defender Marcelo accidentally poked the ball into his own net to gift Croatia the lead in the opening game.\n\nThe Corinthians Arena in Sao Paulo went dead silent, save for the pocket of Croatian fans among the 61,600-strong crowd who went bananas.\n\nWe all know that Brazil eventually roared back to win the game, but fans to this day are still debating the performance of Yuichi Nishimura, the Japanese referee criticised by Croatian coach Niko Kovac as being out of his depth and making \"a circus\" of the World Cup.\n\nNishimura was accused of giving Brazil a soft penalty after Fred tumbled to the ground from the slightest of touches by a Croatian defender.\n\nNeymar, who was lucky enough to stay on the pitch after only getting a yellow card from Nishimura for thrusting his forearm into Luka Modric in the first half, hammered home the spot kick and fans of the host nation went home happy.\n\nThe World Cup has also produced a classic example of David slaying Goliath - in this case, Costa Rica, the small Central American nation tipped to be the whipping boys in their group, somehow beating Uruguay 3-1, a team ranked seventh in the world.\n\nWhat in the world could possibly happen next, one wonders. An England physiotherapist dislocating his ankle while celebrating his team's goal and being stretchered off the pitch? Hang on, that already happened yesterday.\n\nThis is fast shaping up to be one heck of a World Cup, and I hope this rollercoaster ride doesn't stop any time soon.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Even the World Cup soccer competition could become a distraction for potential buyers in this tepid market, analysts say.\n\n\"It is premature to conclude that the market has revived from its slump,\" said Ong Teck Hui, national director of Research and Consultancy at JLL, pointing to the mixed showing at new launches last month.\n\nLatest data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority showed that developers sold 1,470 private condos last month, the highest level since June 2013 and a 96 per cent jump from the 749 units sold in April. The top five projects made up 78 per cent of total sales in May.\n\nThe strong showing is driven by new launches, with 1,790 condo units launched last month compared with only 600 units in April. There were no new launches for executive condos (ECs) last month; 58 ECs were sold, up from 48 in April.\n\n\"The increase in the number of new projects launched in May and the strong launch figures do show that developers are more confident in resuming launches as there still many buyers in the market but who are now more price-sensitive,\" Mr Ong said.\n\nThe two top sellers were Coco Palms and Commonwealth Towers - both located near MRT stations and deemed attractively priced. Together, they made up more than half the month's unit launches and sales. Some 590 units at Coco Palms were sold at a median price of $1,018 per square foot (psf), and 275 at Commonwealth Towers were sold at a median price of $1,626 psf.\n\nThe Panorama in Ang Mo Kio became a top seller last month, with some 100 units sold at a median $1,241 psf after developer Wheelock Properties slashed prices by around 10 per cent in its re-launch last month. The project moved only 56 units in the initial launch in January at a median $1,343 psf.\n\nNot all new launches fared well, however. Oxley's The Rise@Oxley Residences - the only new launch in the Core Central Region (CCR) - sold eight units out of 120 at a median price of $2,452 psf.\n\nEcco Development' Singa Hills and Macly Equity's Loft 33 managed to move only two units and 12 units respectively. These projects were apparently launched with little or no fanfare.\n\n\"Projects that lack visibility will see greater difficulty in attracting buyers, especially if they are not near transport nodes and the price point is not attractive,\" said Alice Tan, Knight Frank's head of research and consultancy.\n\nColliers International director of research and advisory Chia Siew Chuin noted that Commonwealth Towers in Queenstown and Kallang Riverside in Kampong Bugis have benefited from pent-up demand, given the lack of new launches in the two locations.\n\nBut developers' sales volume is expected to ease to 600-900 units in the traditional lull period of June, before developers resume their launches ahead of August, which is the lunar seventh month and regarded by the Chinese as an inauspicious period to commit to home purchases, Mr Chia said.\n\nPotential launches in the pipeline include Roxy-Pacific's Trilive, a freehold project in Tampines Road of which 70-80 per cent of the 222 units are dual-key units, which are essentially a 2-in-1 apartments.\n\nWing Tai opened the showflat last Saturday for its 469-unit The Crest at Prince Charles Crescent, while China Sonangol Land and OKP Land are slated to launch their 109-unit freehold project Amber Skye on Amber Road soon.\n\nNicholas Mak, executive director at SLP International, expects mass-market condos in suburban areas to continue leading sales islandwide.\n\nLast month, mass-market suburban condos accounted for 64 per cent of sales and slightly over half of total units launched.\n\nThis is followed by city-fringe condos in the Rest of Central Region (RCR) that made up about 34 per cent of sales and 39 per cent of units launched. There were only 32 units sold in the CCR or 2 per cent of total islandwide sales.\n\nMr Mak noted that some developers hurried to launch mass-market condos last month ahead of new EC launches this year. From August to December, five EC projects with a total of 3,100 units could potentially be launched for sale.\n\nWith the increased competition, some developers may adopt \"a more flexible pricing strategy\" to boost their sales, he added. For the whole of 2014, sales volumes in the primary market could total 9,500-12,500 units, Mr Mak predicted. This compares with some 15,301 units sold by developers for the whole of last year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The can contains what many fans and commentators have already described as \"the vanishing spray\".\n\nThe referee first draws a circle around the ball, then he paces out a distance of 10 yards and sprays a straight line where the defenders must stand behind. The water-based substance, which looks a lot like shaving foam, usually disappears in about a minute or so.\n\nWhile this technique, meant to ensure fair play during free kicks, has been employed in several leagues before, such as Major League Soccer in the United States, this is the first time it is being used at the World Cup.\n\nIt's such a simple solution to prevent the defensive wall from shuffling closer to the ball, and one wonders why it hasn't been used sooner at the world's most prestigious football tournament.\n\nAfter all, it's common to see how a wall of players might try to sneak closer to the ball once the referee has his back turned for a split-second.\n\nThe player taking the free kick, too, would often place the ball a few inches nearer to the goal in order to gain an advantage, no matter how small it may be.\n\nThe foamy spray isn't the only device coming to the aid of referees. Much has been said about the new goal-line technology that is being used at all 12 stadiums in Brazil, a multi-million dollar investment by Fifa to help reduce human error in deciding whether a goal has been scored or not.\n\nWe got a taste of the German-made GoalControl system on Monday morning when France were awarded a goal in its match with Honduras with the help of some nifty computer-generated 3-D technology.\n\nThere was some initial confusion as to whether French striker Karim Benzema's effort in the 48th minute had crossed the line.\n\nThe referee, like many of us watching at home, could not have been entirely sure but he got a big assist from seven high-speed cameras that are able to film at 500 images per second.\n\nIn this instance, the system sent a one-word message, \"GOAL\", to the referee's watch and he wasted no time in giving the goal to France, much to the chagrin of the frustrated Honduras coach.\n\nThe goal-line technology in football is not too different from the Hawkeye system used in tennis and cricket, which can determine via slow motion replay whether a ball was in or out.\n\nOf course, there are the football purists who insist that technology such as this has no place in football. Errors are part and parcel of the game, they say, and the final decision of the referee - without the use of computers - should be respected.\n\nI'm all for this goal-line technology because it means that a team that scores a valid goal won't be unfairly robbed of it, just like how England's Frank Lampard was denied a legitimate goal against Germany at the 2010 World Cup.\n\nFootball, like many other things in this world, is fast changing with the times. One can only hope that \"The Beautiful Game\" is all the better for it over time.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Splitting the fleet between two jurisdictions would be too expensive, he said. \"It's very stupid and not very cost effective to have one airline flying east and another airline flying west.\"\n\nNorwegian Air made its first foray into long-haul flying in 2013 with routes from Scandinavia to the US and Thailand. Service from London to New York, Los Angeles and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, will start as planned next month, though the US Transportation Department hasn't granted a foreign air carrier permit for the Irish subsidiary, Mr Kjos said.\n\n\"Norwegian Air Shuttle's application is pending,\" a department spokesman, Ryan Daniels, said in an e-mailed statement. \"Because it is a contested proceeding, the department cannot comment on the merits of the case.\"\n\nThe US House of Representatives last week passed an amendment to the department's budget aimed at blocking the application. The US Air Line Pilots Association said that Norwegian was seeking to base jets in Ireland, without flying from there, \"expressly to evade the social laws of Norway in order to lower the wages and working conditions of its air crew.\"\n\nThe European Commission said that the Ireland-based Norwegian Air subsidiary can fly trans-Atlantic routes from the EU under the 28-nation bloc's \"open skies\" accord with the US. The commission, the EU's executive arm, said that it raised the matter with US officials at a June 10 meeting in Vienna and received no explanation for the US government's failure to grant a foreign permit to the Irish unit. The commission said it would consult with EU nations on the next steps.\n\n\"We are keeping all our options open on how to respond,\" the Brussels-based commission said last Friday by e-mail.\n\nMr Kjos said that the US pilots it uses on trans-Atlantic flights are paid an above-average rate, and that many are joining from established network airlines. The carrier can add new flights \"under the same operation, with the same crew as we're doing today\" using its Norwegian air operator's certificate if it has to do so in the short term, he said.\n\nNorwegian Air is embarking on one of the industry's most ambitious growth plans as it rolls out long-haul flights while swelling an 88-plane European fleet with 222 mainly re-engined Boeing Co 737s and Airbus Group NV A320s arriving from 2016.\n\nMr Kjos's long-haul ambitions are built around the lower operating costs of the all-composite Boeing 787 Dreamliner that he says will finally make low-cost flights viable after decades of false starts at carriers such as Laker Airways. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Securing the sites with a shorter lease term initially is the best way to keep the momentum going for the project which is attracting a significant amount of attention in the local market,\" the company said.\n\nThe purchase price has been revised from US$81.28 million, which was premised on a new 70-year master lease, to US$43.2 million based on the remaining 24 and 26- year lease terms.\n\nThe acquisition, via 80 per cent-owned unit Meeyahta International Hotel Limited, will be funded via a one-for-eight rights issue at 38 cents per share instead of the originally planned one-for-four rights issue.\n\nUnder the revised agreement, the remaining sum of US$38.08 million will be paid to the vendors, Serge Pun & Associates (SPA), a private vehicle of Yoma's executive chairman and major shareholder Serge Pun, when the leases for the sites are extended.\n\n\"We remain confident that the longer lease will ultimately be obtained and that the Landmark Development will become one of downtown Yangon's iconic commercial and residential areas,\" said Yoma chief executive Andrew Rickards.\n\nMr Pun has indicated that he intends to subscribe to his entitlement to the rights issue and if need be, he will also support the cash call in full.\n\nOn the site, to be developed into a mixed-use development which will be the group's flagship project, sits one of Yangon's most famous heritage buildings - the former Burma Railway Company headquarters, which was built in 1877.\n\nThis mega deal has been in the making for quite a while. It was first announced in November 2012 but has been delayed by regulatory hurdles, not unusual for a frontier market such as Myanmar.\n\nThe deal's long-stop date was extended to end- June on protracted talks with the Myanmar Investment Commission for the lease extension, which is still ongoing.\n\n\"It has become apparent that the conditions precedent stipulated in the sale- and-purchase agreement on the proposed acquisition will not be satisfied before the long-stop date,\" said Yoma, adding that SPA was confident that they will eventually be satisfied. \"However, the timing of such is uncertain at this juncture,\" it said.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Business Times, Mr Rickards admitted that because the deal was an interested-person transaction, it had to be announced in the early stages with shareholder approval sought first.\n\nAs a result, the deal has been in the public domain for long and therefore appeared to be taking longer than usual to complete.\n\n\"We didn't want to negotiate in Myanmar and find out that Yoma shareholders didn't want to do it. So we checked it out with shareholders first and then negotiated the deal,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a high-profile deal and one with an eye-catching major development in the middle of town. That has attracted the analyst community who thought it would start on time.\n\n\"That hasn't happened but we haven't lost our patience. Patience is a virtue when doing business in Myanmar,\" he had said.\n\nYoma shares closed 1.5 cents lower at 77.5 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for a 0.5 per cent increase. Manufacturing, which makes up 75 per cent of total production, also increased 0.6 per cent.\n\nDemand for industrial goods is improving as consumer and business spending strengthen and the economy rebounds from its worst performance in three years. Bigger gains in corporate investment and stronger growth in overseas markets will be needed to provide an additional lift for US producers.\n\n\"Manufacturing activity is humming along at a fairly constructive pace,\" said Tom Porcelli, chief US economist at RBC Capital Markets LLC, who accurately forecast the production gain. \"That's something we expect will continue over the rest of the year.\"\n\nAnother report showed that manufacturing unexpectedly picked up this month as orders jumped. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's factory index rose to 19.3 for June, the highest in four years, from 19 the prior month. Readings greater than zero signal growth for the so-called Empire State Index that covers New York, northern New Jersey and southern Connecticut.\n\nYesterday's reports are consistent with data from the Institute for Supply Management that showed manufacturing expanded last month at the fastest pace this year as American assembly-line workers responded to increased orders by cranking up production.\n\nThe economy may grow at a 3.5 per cent annual clip in the second quarter after contracting at a one per cent pace in the first three months of the year, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. Gains in business and consumer spending will be needed to lift growth and spur employment after the world's biggest economy was weighed down by harsh winter weather.\n\nSeparately, confidence among US homebuilders rose in June by the most in almost a year, a sign that the residential real estate market is stabilising after reeling from severe winter weather earlier this year.\n\nThe National Association of Home Builders/ Wells Fargo sentiment gauge climbed to 49 this month from 45 in May, the biggest gain since July 2013, figures from the Washington-based group showed. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Sacred Success International controls the day-to-day operations of LSE.\n\nHuan Hsin, which is expecting a gain of US$500,000 from the transaction, plans to use the disposal proceeds to enhance its existing in-house capabilities in manufacturing steel moulds for notebook computers.\n\nAlthough the disposal constitutes a major transaction - and would therefore be subject to the approval of shareholders - Huan Hsin, citing various reasons, has successfully applied to the SGX for a waiver of this requirement.\n\nAssuming that the disposal had been completed on Jan 1 this year, Huan Hsin's loss per share for FY2013 would have narrowed from 18.81 cents per share to 18.62 cents per share.\n\nHuan Hsin shares closed trading yesterday unchanged at 1.4 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/startup-life-here-begins-bit-later-and-after-job", "site_title": "Startup life here begins a bit later, and after a job", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nStartup life here begins a bit later, and after a job\n\nMore firms founded by those aged 35 and above\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jun 15, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] Thanks to Facebook, and now HBO's latest startup sitcom Silicon Valley, the popular image of an entrepreneur is very much Mark Zuckerberg-inspired: a male, socially awkward geek in his early 20s, a tad unkempt, and whose \"uniform\" consists of a pair of jeans and a hoodie.\n\nThis stereotype is, of course, only a part of the entrepreneurship story. In Singapore, it is increasingly likely that entrepreneurs are older - 35-and-up adults who are abandoning their nine-to-five jobs to start their own companies, backed by accumulated savings and knowledge of a certain industry, said observers. The findings of a poll of 102 Singapore startups conducted by The Business Times squares with this perceived trend. The number of startups here founded by entrepreneurs who were aged at least 35 in the year of the launch of the business has generally risen since 2006.\n\nHugh Mason, co-founder of startup incubator JFDI, said: \"It's as if they did what their parents told them to do when they were young - take a 'sensible' job. But now that their own kids are independent, they want to leverage the deep domain expertise they've built up in a certain industry, to tackle issues that just aren't getting resolved in that industry.\"\n\nThis was certainly the case for Patrick Goh and Sam Koh, who co-founded luxury-bedding distributor Intero when they were both in their mid-40s. Having jointly spent more than 50 years in the bedding industry at that point, they had noticed an absence of designer and luxury brands in the market. Intero was set up to plug that gap.\n\nMr Mason added he has been seeing more corporate executives at JFDI's open-house events, most of them parents whose children had left home or adults who were returning to the workforce after \"a change in life\".\n\nAmit Anand, a founding partner of entrepreneur-backed venture firm Jungle Ventures, attributes the rise to a dramatic and favourable shift in the risk-reward ratio of launching a startup in its last 1 1/2 years.\n\nAn increase in funding options and the chance for a successful startup to get listed or be bought out for huge sums down the road are enticing more experienced folk to dump their cushy, salaried jobs for a shot at entrepreneurship, he said.\n\nJust two months ago, local live-chat startup Zopim was acquired by San Francisco's customer-support company Zendesk for up to US$30 million; last September, video-streaming site Viki was snagged by Japan's e-commerce giant Rakuten for US$200 million in the largest-known exit for a homegrown startup.\n\nChong Chee Wah, co-founder of technology commercialiser and incubator Clearbridge Accelerator, said: \"Several macro factors are definitely aligning. Government support in terms of grants and more prevalent news of success stories today have prompted older entrepreneurs to pursue their dreams. Even though they have financial commitments like family and housing loans, they have also accumulated sufficient savings and done a more comprehensive risk assessment before taking the plunge.\"\n\nIndustry watchers say that older entrepreneurs are clearly superior in business experience, credibility, interpersonal skills, networking and the ability to raise money.\n\nArnout Mostert, a partner at incubator AccelerAsia, said, however, that experience can sometimes work against such individuals: \"This is especially if they get stuck in the 'we've tried that before and it doesn't work' mentality, and miss an opportunity.\"\n\nBut if the older entrepreneur has no experience with startups, they are not likely to have any advantage over their younger peers, said Lim Kuo-Yi, a founding partner at Monk's Hill Ventures. \"Working in a multinational corporation for instance, with systems in place and resources available, is quite different from starting a company from scratch.\"\n\nClearbridge's Mr Chong has started 11 companies since he was 37 years old - eight in biomedical, medical tech and materials and three in information security. He said, however, that he has rarely seen younger people get into such high-tech startups.\n\n\"Such technologies require a certain level of experience to judge and develop products. Perhaps, as entrepreneurs age, their breadth of tech startups increases,\" he said.\n\nYounger entrepreneurs tend to focus on app and Internet startups. They also have the benefit of energy and optimism, are less encumbered by family and financial commitments and generally more willing to take risks, said observers.\n\nYounger entrepreneurs are better at coming up with innovations that are more \"business-unusual\", said Desai Narasimhalu, director at the Singapore Management University's Institute of Innovation and Entrepreneurship.\n\nHe said: \"Older entrepreneurs are better at identifying opportunities in mature product or service spaces, and can offer incremental or disruptive innovations for that industry. It would be very unlikely for them though, to create a Facebook-equivalent (unlike their younger peers).\"\n\nBut age is just a number to Kris Leong, a vice-president in Walden International Singapore. She said: \"A 25-year-old may have a mature outlook while a 40-year-old may be relatively immature.\" Qualities of good entrepreneurs - young or old - include tenacity, maturity in business outlook, being a team player, being open and coachable and having the hunger to succeed, she said.\n\nSingapore's startup ecosystem, like most things, benefits from having a mix of young and old entrepreneurs, said Edwin Chow, executive director for innovation & start-ups group at Spring Singapore.\n\nSaid Vinnie Lauria, founding partner of Golden Gate Ventures: \"When you bring together people with different backgrounds, experiences, perspectives and networks, you have the right ingredients for what I call 'serendipitous innovation'.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The gross floor area is estimated at 7,911 sq ft.\n\nThe site is zoned for commercial use but is permanently approved for hotel use. The shophouses have 15 themed rooms (with an average size of around 215 sq ft), spanning across two storeys and a mezzanine level, a cafe lounge and a small pool.\n\nThe indicative pricing translates to a net yield of around 2-3 per cent, based on the current income stream from rooms as well as food and beverage operations.\n\nOperating as Ardennes Hotel, the hotel's occupancy rate averages around 70 per cent while the average room rate is about $200 per night. Cushman & Wakefield, the sole marketing agent for the property, is conducting an expression of interest exercise for the property that will close on July 17.\n\nThe property is currently owned by a company controlled by a group of private investors who bought the three shophouses four years ago and converted them into a boutique hotel that it currently operates.\n\nThe property is being sold with vacant possession. The new owner could continue to operate it as a hotel or appoint an external party to operate the hotel, said Shaun Poh, executive director of capital markets at Cushman & Wakefield.\n\n\"Despite the current overall property market slowdown as a result of the total debt servicing ratio framework introduced a year ago, conservation commercial shophouses, especially those with approved hotel use, remain an attractive investment option in view of their limited supply,\" he said. Recently, Urban Redevelopment Authority has become stricter in approving hotel use in shophouses, he added.\n\nMeanwhile, those keen on shophouses in the Little India Conservation Area may want to check out three adjoining properties at 2, 4 and 6 Dunlop Street. The 999-year leasehold properties, which are zoned for commercial use, are on 2,475 sq ft of land area and have about 6,000 sq ft gross floor area.\n\nThe indicative price is $9.5 million. JLL, the exclusive marketing agent for the sale, is conducting an expression of interest exercise closing on July 10. The property is to be sold on vacant possession.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We believe the securities would have a perpetual effective maturity, given the language on replacement intent in the instruments' indenture. The step-up to a cumulative 100 basis points, on and after 25 years following the issue date, would have set the effective maturity date on the reset date in 2039.\"\n\nHowever, Fitch added that due to the expectation that the instrument will remain outstanding or will be replaced by a similar instrument, such effective maturity date is rendered irrelevant. Therefore, the proposed securities' 50 per cent equity credit will remain in effect until they are replaced.\n\nThe proposed securities will be used to refinance the repurchase of the US$350 million 8.5 per cent hybrid capital securities issued on Nov 1, 2010. Fitch has accorded no equity credit to the existing US$350 million capital securities. Following the replacement of the existing US$350 million capital securities with the proposed securities, there will be a slight decrease in overall debt level on the assumption that the securities will receive 50 per cent equity credit.\n\n\"This change has immaterial effect on the company's leverage level, as we expect Noble to achieve significant deleveraging through its sale of a 51 per cent stake in Noble Agri Limited, a wholly owned agriculture subsidiary, to China's COFCO Corporation announced on April 2, 2014,\" Fitch added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The take-up comes amid reports that the Hong Kong-listed builder plans to reclaim land for a huge 5,000-acre (2,023 hectare) man-made island near Pendas and the Second Link in Johor.\n\nWork has already commenced on the island. Development would be undertaken in joint venture with state agency Kumpulan Prasarana Rakyat Johor and span over 30 years, The Star newspaper reported yesterday.\n\nThe daily quoted Country Garden's regional president for Malaysia, Kayson Yuen, as stating plans for a mixed development, including luxury homes. Local contractors had been hired for reclamation works as well as an Australian consultant who had previously worked on Sentosa Island's reclamation.\n\n\"This will be a massive mixed development and the investment and commitment shows our confidence in the Malaysia market,\" Mr Yuen said.\n\nBecause of softening demand for properties in China, developers there have taken to venturing overseas to \"hotspots\" such as Malaysia. The Johor economic zone of Iskandar has been an attraction owing to its proximity to Singapore and Malaysian government incentives.\n\nLast November, Guangzhou R&F Properties Co Ltd acquired some 47 ha of land in Johor Baru from the Sultan of Johor for RM4.5 billion (S$1.75 billion). The land consists of four plots of vacant freehold and another two plots of reclaimed freehold land, which is to be developed in partnership with the monarch.\n\nHowever, Country Garden has a head-start over Guangzhou R&F. Last year, it launched its Danga Bay mixed development and said about two-thirds of its 9,000-plus residential high-rise units were snapped up.\n\nIskandar Waterfront Holdings is its partner in the 22-ha project. Over the past six months, Malaysia's property market has seen demand dip because of additional cooling measures. However, realtors expect interest in landed properties - especially those in the bigger cities - to remain relatively robust.\n\nOver the weekend, Country Garden regional sales & marketing general manager You Li said its landed homes in Semenyih - about 11/2 hours drive from Kuala Lumpur - had seen a 70 per cent take-up in the first phase which consists of 400-odd houses - link homes, bungalows and mansions. The link homes (built up of 2,300 sq ft) are priced from RM900,000.\n\nMr You said the first phase was sold at an average RM378 per square foot, and that the second and final phase of 500-plus units would be launched in August or September at a higher price.\n\nCountry Garden owns 55 per cent of Diamond City which it is building in partnership with the landowner, the Mayland Group.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Prices in Kensington and Chelsea, Britain's most expensive district, fell 0.3 per cent to \u00a32.38 million. Across the UK, they rose 0.1 per cent, a less-than-average increase for this time of year.\n\n\"Parts of the London market are starting to run out of steam,\" Rightmove director Miles Shipside said. \"It's an example to the rest of the country of what happens when affordability and common sense get stretched too far.\"\n\nThe slowdown comes as Mark Carney prepares to lead a discussion among Bank of England financial-stability officials today on whether action is needed to prevent property from overheating. Rightmove said that new tougher mortgage rules and a cooling in demand may have taken some momentum from the market.\n\nOnly a third of London's 32 boroughs saw asking prices rise this month, Rightmove said. The largest increase was in Westminster, the second-most expensive district, where values climbed 3.5 per cent. Prices in Haringey, north London, plunged 4.8 per cent.\n\nUK home prices have surged in the past year amid near record-low borrowing costs and a strengthening economic recovery. In London, values got an extra boost from cash-rich foreign investors seeking a haven.

It's the place where people want to be together.\"\n\nHe also said the British need to change their attitude to the rich. \"We have a natural British reserve about accumulating billions,\" Mr Johnson said. \"There's nothing sinful or wrong about amassing wealth. The banks and the venture capital people need to be as daring and risk-taking as they can be.\"\n\nMr Johnson said the technology startups he wanted to attract to London weren't put off by poor facilities. \"They love that stuff,\" he said. \"The older and creakier, the better.\"\n\nThe mayor said he was proud that London's immigrant population now matched New York's. \"We have even more languages spoken than New York,\" he said. \"The original language of London was of course Latin.

Dealers also said Samsung, which accounted for almost a third of all global smartphone shipments in the first quarter, bought nearly 300 billion won worth of three-year treasury bonds late last month.\n\nWhile it is not unusual for Samsung to buy bonds, dealers said it has typically bought debt issued by highly rated government-backed financial firms such as Korea Development Bank and Korea Finance Corp.\n\n\"I think Samsung is diversifying its holdings and spreading out its maturities,\" said Hanwha Securities fixed-income analyst Kong Dong-rak. \"Samsung has to manage the cash in some way and it can't always get the right yields and duration from the banks, so it looks like it went to the bond market to find new avenues.\"\n\nSamsung's appetite for bonds has helped push up prices of shorter-dated local debt, dealers said, especially prices of two- and three-year bonds. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nLG Electronics shares jump on report of AI chip gear development\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:27 AM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nUS tariffs put spotlight on industrial S-Reits\u2019 upcoming H1 earnings\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM", "images": []}

The pound rose against the US dollar, taking its gain over the past year to about 8 per cent.\n\nPressure to act has mounted as house prices increase faster than wage growth, stretching affordability for homebuyers.\n\nThe number of high loan-to-income mortgages is rising and Mr Carney warned last week of signs that banks are weakening underwriting standards.\n\nBritons owed a record \u00a31.28 trillion (S$2.72 trillion) on their mortgages in April, an amount equal to about 76 per cent of gross domestic product, latest BOE figures show.\n\nAccording to the Council of Mortgage lenders, first-time buyers in London are borrowing almost four times their gross income and the average loan is \u00a3200,000 - almost double the UK as a whole.\n\nA report from Acadata Ltd on Friday showed that house prices jumped 8.5 per cent in the year through May, and data from the statistics office showed London values surging an annual 17 per cent in March. That growth has prompted warnings from the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nBOE officials have acknowledged the dangers. Deputy governor for Financial Stability Jon Cunliffe has said it would be \"dangerous\" to ignore the momentum, while fellow policymaker Ben Broadbent said last week that housing is a risk to the economy.\n\nTwenty-nine of 34 economists, or 85 per cent, in Bloomberg's June survey said Britain's housing market is at risk from overheating. That's up from 82 per cent in May and the highest since the question was first posed in November.\n\nWhen asked in May if the FPC will take steps this month to cool the housing market, only about two- thirds of respondents agreed.\n\nMr Carney said last week that the FPC will weigh \"the merits of graduated and proportionate actions to mitigate the potential vulnerabilities arising from what is the greatest risk to the domestic economy\". Those comments were \"a clear hint that the FPC will take action at its coming meeting\", according to David Tinsley, an economist at BNP Paribas SA in London and a former BOE official.\n\nOf the economists who say policymakers should take action, the most favoured option, supported by 63 per cent, is the capping of loan-to-value ratios on mortgages.\n\nIncreasing banks' sectoral capital requirements was backed by 41 per cent and reducing the maximum value of properties eligible under Help to Buy, a government programme to aid people with small downpayments, was supported by 37 per cent.\n\nThe FPC will publish the results of the meeting on June 26.\n\nEconomists' interest rate forecasts are centred on the first half of 2015, though the monthly poll was conducted before Mr Carney's comments on the potential timing of the first rate increase. Some economists have changed their predictions since then.\n\nSociete Generale SA now expects a quarter- point increase in the fourth quarter instead of the first quarter of next year and says an earlier move is possible. Deutsche Bank AG brought forward its forecast by six months to November.\n\n\"The governor has made it very clear that we should be gearing up for a rate rise later this year,\" said George Buckley, an economist at Deutsche Bank in London. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

Others are thinking of going for good.\n\nWhile the crackdown has been building for a year, Chinese police shocked the foreign business community a month ago when they filed corruption charges against Mark Reilly, former China head of British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc. The Briton, who has been barred from leaving China, could face decades in prison.\n\nEven before then, executives were getting worried about a wave of visits from police and regulators to their offices as well as articles in Chinese media alleging corrupt practices against many global drugmakers.\n\nThe charges against Mr Reilly had prompted some senior executives to look at all contingencies, several legal and industry sources said. \"Many of our clients are asking about personal liabilities and insurance, with executives asking if they are put in jail what will happen to their families and how the company will provide protection for them,\" said John Huang, Shanghai-based co-founder and managing partner at law firm MWE China.\n\nPolice said that a year-long investigation found that GSK made billions of yuan from schemes to bribe doctors and hospitals. Two senior Chinese executives were also charged.\n\nBritain's biggest drugmaker has said that the accusations were\"deeply concerning\" and that it had zero tolerance for bribery. Mr Reilly has not been reachable for comment while his lawyer has declined to talk to the media.\n\nGlobal drugmakers contacted by Reuters declined to comment about the crackdown and how it was affecting executive morale in the world's third-largest pharmaceutical market.\n\nBut Mr Huang and two pharmaceutical executives said that some managers were reconsidering the legal risks involved in holding any position where they were responsible for some of the thousands of marketing and sales staff that global firms employ across China.\n\nInvestigators have focused on those staff and how they deal with poorly paid doctors and administrators in public hospitals, the biggest buyers of medicine in China.\n\nThe crackdown, which shows no sign of abating, coincides with a wider campaign by President Xi Jinping against corporate and official graft.\n\nLawyers said that some executives and in-house counsel had sought legal advice about leaving China to avoid getting caught up in any future probes. Some top managers were actively pursuing career options outside China, said one source.\n\nOthers were contemplating a more temporary escape until the worst blew over. \"They are thinking about leaving China short-term, staying out of the country on a three or six-month rotation,\" said another Shanghai-based lawyer, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject.\n\nBy moving abroad, executives would avoid being arrested should there be any formal investigation into their firms, lawyers said. Executives had sought advice on relocating to Singapore, Hong Kong and other destinations, they added.\n\nSome international firms were also finding it harder to attract staff to China, said the two pharmaceutical executives at separate global drugmakers, who declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nOther executives believe the GSK case is a one-off event and are more focused on not falling foul of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which can apply to a wide variety of firms that have business ties to the United States.\n\nThat would be a mistake, said Steven Dickinson, partner at law firm Harris Moure in the Chinese port city of Qingdao. \"Every week I write an email saying you're missing the point - you won't have time to get hit by the US law because you'll be in jail in China,\" Mr Dickinson said.\n\nWhile formal charges have only been levelled against GSK executives, virtually all big drugmakers in China have come under scrutiny from police or regulators. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Mr Koh, who has been accumulating LCD shares since last month to become a substantial shareholder, has raised his stake to 14.37 per cent by June 12.\n\nGiven his aggressive open-market purchases at prices ranging from 20 cents to 27 cents per share, substantially higher than the buyout offer, some market watchers are saying that this could signal a counter-bid.\n\nA dealer from CIMB said that a competing offer from Mr Koh is possible. Even if this is not forthcoming, Mr Koh's recent share acquisitions could force the hands of brothers Raymond and David Lum to raise their bid price.\n\nThe Lums, who control about 32 per cent of LCD shares through their own holdings and those of concert parties, had in April made the buyout offer.\n\nDavid is the senior executive director of LCD and managing director of listed construction and property company Lum Chang Holdings, while Raymond is the executive chairman of Lum Chang.\n\nRoger Tan, chief executive of Voyage Research, noted that the Lums will need Mr Koh's support if they seek to cross the 90 per cent stake threshold to take the company private. But he does not think that Mr Koh's share purchases in LCD could stoke a higher bid from the Lum brothers.\n\n\"If they do make a higher offer, then it is a signal that there is hidden value in the company that the brothers want to protect,\" he said.\n\nMr Koh himself could not be reached for comment.\n\nFrustrated LCD shareholders have voiced their unhappiness to SIAS, the Securities Investors Association (Singapore), over the buyout offer from the Lum family.\n\nSIAS president David Gerald said yesterday that the association has urged the offeror to raise its offer price and will seek an update soon.\n\nLCD's appointed independent financial adviser, Provenance Capital, has deemed the offer \"fair from the historical market share price perspective\" but \"not so compelling\" with respect to LCD's net asset value (NAV) of 27.2 cents per share. The offer has been extended to June 23, after receiving valid acceptances representing 3.67 per cent of the issued share capital of LCD as at June 9.\n\nMr Koh's other investments include a 10.3 per cent stake in property and construction group TA Corp, based on the latter's 2013 annual report. Besides helming Aspial, whose property arm World Class Land is developing projects like Kensington Square, Urban Vista and East Village, Mr Koh is also chairman of pawnbroker Maxi-Cash Financial Services.\n\nHis brother Koh Wee Meng is the executive chairman and CEO of Fragrance Group, which runs more than 20 economy hotels locally and builds landed homes and apartments here.\n\nSome market observers cited potential synergies between LCD's hospitality business and the property businesses of the Koh brothers, suggesting why a strategic influence in LCD is highly coveted.\n\nJust last week, LCD clinched a franchise agreement with The Ascott Ltd to rebrand its Parkview Executive Suites in Laos as Somerset Vientiane. It also manages hotels and resorts in London and Thailand, and is expected to recognise revenue this year from its integrated project in Xuzhou in China's Jiangsu province. In addition, LCD owns a stake in global real estate consultancy Knight Frank via its 80 per cent interest in Cheong Hock Chye & Co (Pte) Ltd.\n\nIts net loss attributable to shareholders in the third quarter ended March 31 widened to $12.4 million from $970,000 a year ago due to an impairment of capitalised costs for the development of InterContinental Phuket Rawai Beach Resort given the political situation in Thailand. It has net cash of $35 million and a net gearing of 4.5 per cent as at March 31.\n\nLCD shares closed trading on Friday at 26.5 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

I don't think it will happen.\"\n\nThe Philippines, Vietnam and other regional powers believe China is the instigator in the fresh eruptions in the disputes, which have been going on for decades but have been managed without confrontation for much of the time.\n\nAsia's most populous nation claims nearly all of the sea, even waters approaching the coasts of its neighbours.\n\nTaiwan has a replica claim, while Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei insist they have sovereign rights to areas closer to their coasts.\n\nVietnam's trigger for fury was China's deployment last month of an oil rig in waters near the Paracel islands.\n\nAnti-Chinese riots promptly broke out in the South-east Asian nation, leading to at least three deaths and a number of arson attacks against factories that were either Chinese-owned or perceived to be. Beijing says four Chinese citizens died in the unrest.\n\nThe Philippines has been the most vocal critic in recent years, accusing China of a multitude of aggressive acts, including the takeover in 2012 of a shoal that had been a rich fishing ground for Filipinos.\n\nThe Philippines has expressed fresh alarm in recent months after photos emerged showing Chinese land reclamation activities on tiny islets in the Spratlys archipelago.\n\nThe photos have led to speculation that China intends to build military installations on new artificial islands within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.\n\nHowever, Mr Krishna said China would be careful to ensure its actions did not lead to a military conflict that would disrupt shipping lanes, pointing out it had the most to lose.\n\n\"A large fraction of the trade flowing through the South China Sea is destined to, or originating from, China,\" he pointed out. \"They need that for their economy.\"\n\nShivaji Das, a Singapore-based senior vice president with global consultancy firm Frost and Sullivan, said only a war would lead to a disruption of the South China Sea trade routes. \"And I don't see that happening. All the countries have an immense stake (in keeping the trade routes open),\" he added.\n\nMr Das also said the rules of \"freedom of navigation\" in the sea had rarely been broken by governments anywhere in the world in recent history, with those threats coming more from piracy.\n\n\"When it comes to commerce, all the countries have their exclusive economic zones but they still allow for freedom of navigation of merchant ships. And that won't be affected unless there's an actual conflict in the zone,\" he explained. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

He pointed out that industrials' margins have also backed down after bonanza years and that rising risks from El Nino have contributed to poor earnings for planters.\n\nAs valuations remain inexpensive, the UOB report said that mergers and acquisitions, as well as asset monetisation, is the key theme moving into the second half of the year.\n\nThe note added: \"Sectors such as exploration and production, oil services, healthcare devices and deeply-valued stocks may enjoy trading interest.\n\n\"Stocks that may see M&A or privatisation interest include the likes of Sino Grandness, QTV and Tuan Sing.\"\n\nMr Ng Kian Teck said that he continues to \"like sectors that perform well in inflationary and higher interest rate period\", such as the oil and gas sector and commodities.\n\nWith the ongoing situation in Iraq, CIMB's economist Song Seng Wun said the developments have not affected oil prices greatly and that \"the market is somewhat complacent at this point\".\n\nAs the market wobbles along, analysts say banking, telecommunications and Reits are expected to drive the earnings recovery in 2015.\n\nUOB believes that the equity markets will require at least one to two quarters of sustainable earnings growth before investors are convinced that earnings are in full recovery mode.\n\nAmong the large caps, UOB favours CapitaLand, DBS, Keppel Corporation and SingPost.\n\nSimilarly, CIMB's top picks for the year include DBS, Keppel Corporation and Global Logistic Properties. For small/mid cap, its picks include Frasers Centrepoint Trust, GuocoLeisure and Mermaid Maritime.\n\nFor growth prospect and a stable business outlook, Voyage chooses Cordlife while it favours Nam Cheong for its \"unique positioning in the shipbuilding sector\".\n\nAs for investors who can stomach higher risks, it said that incoming assets from W Corporation and Transcu look interesting.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

What other healthcare financing issues remain to be tackled?\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jun 15, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nJean-Michel Dumont\n\nChairman\n\nRuder Finn Asia\n\nTHE key healthcare challenges today relate largely to expanding capacity and developing a system to meet the demands of an ageing population. The new MediShield Life Scheme, keeping premiums affordable for all Singaporeans, shows that the government is taking on more of the risks and the necessary costs of the increase in healthcare capacity and manpower. This is a good first step and should lead to consideration of other healthcare financing issues. Premiums need to be affordable and still fully payable within Medisave withdrawal limits and contributions. The frail and disabled elderly and their caregivers need financial relief for the costs of hospitalisation and outpatient treatment. The costs involved in caring for the elderly who may require assistance with their daily activities need to be addressed. The current support for long-term care is mainly through means-tested subsidies and this may not be an accurate reflection of current needs. Middle-income families may be stretched, especially if there are several dependants requiring financial aid.\n\nChristophe Duchatellier\n\nCEO\n\nAdecco Asia\n\nWE applaud the new MediShield Life scheme as it certainly addresses the rising healthcare costs in an increasingly ageing population. These new proposals answer the needs of the elderly and the financially dependent. Perhaps we can also rethink the way we look at medical assistance here in Singapore. Suggestions would be to allow earlier withdrawals of the funds for various medical needs which also include outpatient treatments.\n\nWhile priority would be for the elderly, we should consider letting younger Singaporeans have the option to also use their available funds, perhaps by implementing internal limits to the amount they can use. The costs of medical care are rising and it is a real concern for many Singaporeans, young and old. Several discussions have taken place and it is heartening to note that this is a priority for the Singapore government.\n\nDora Hoan\n\nCo-Chairman/Group CEO\n\nBest World International Ltd\n\nTHE proposed MediShield Life scheme will go very far in protecting a majority of Singaporeans against large medical bills. They will also have peace of mind if they live beyond the age of 90. Nevertheless, there are some who may be concerned about the cash payment for the premiums, especially those who do not have a CPF account. Allowing their family members to buy MediShield Life for them can helpyour parents to alleviate their concerns. While the scheme is highly beneficial, it does not cover health screening.\n\nAs early detection and treatment can save lives and prevent big medical bills in the future, perhaps the government can consider allowing Singaporeans to use their Medisave funds for this purpose. Alternatively, insurers can give rebates in the form of health screening vouchers to those who do not make any claim. This will not only help to reduce costs but also encourage Singaporeans to take good care of their health.\n\nKhoo Kah Siang\n\nCEO (Singapore)\n\nGreat Eastern Life\n\nGREAT Eastern supports the recommendations by the MediShield Life Review Committee which provide greater protection for all Singaporeans. We look forward to working closely with the government, the health sector and other stakeholders to bridge the protection gap.\n\nThe Integrated Shield Plan (IP) is a good complement to MediShield Life for those who want enhanced benefits such as coverage for stays in Class A/B1 of restructured hospitals or wards in private hospitals.\n\nAlthough it is premature at this juncture to comment on specifics, Great Eastern is committed to ensuring that our IP plan remains competitively priced and affordable for all.\n\nIt is worth noting that premium rates are calculated based on future consumption trends, medical inflation rate and past claims experience. The pricing of IP plans is predominantly driven by the costs of medical healthcare, which include doctors' charges, hospital charges and drug fees, all of which are beyond what insurers alone can effectively control.\n\nIn this regard, greater public awareness and education is needed that the public has a key role to play. Each of us must take personal charge of our health and take personal responsibility to reduce over-consumption of healthcare services so that costs can be controlled. It is also important to start saving up early for future healthcare needs.\n\nNow is also an opportune time to review the utilisation of all forms of medical facilities and services, as well as look at innovative models in healthcare provision, to enhance system efficiency and ensure that overall medical cost inflation is well contained.\n\nUltimately, as responsible insurers, we need to look at how best to contain costs to make IP plans affordable in the long run as well as provide value-added services to customers to further differentiate IP plans from the basic MediShield Life.\n\nNg Wai Chong\n\nMedical Director\n\nHua Mei Centre for Successful Ageing (Tsao Foundation)\n\nIN the course of Tsao Foundation's work that supports ageing-in-place in the past 21 years, we find that our elders are worried about healthcare costs and about being a burden to their children.\n\nWhile MediShield Life focuses on hospital care, a great deal of our elders' concerns are about day-to-day costs of care that escalate with increasing frailty in later years. It is challenging for them to fully comprehend the details in the plethora of relief schemes and social resources in order to help themselves. Either the schemes have to be designed to be more user-friendly, or there must be easy access to community care management services.\n\nIn addition, although the lower cost of hospital and specialist care is helpful for disadvantaged elders, it may not be sustainable in the long run. There is still an urgent need to ramp up primary care.\n\nMike Muller\n\nPresident, Asia Pacific\n\nAvaya\n\nSOARING healthcare costs impose enormous pressure on governments, healthcare providers and consumers due to issues related to an ageing population (many with chronic diseases), the cost of care-givers, imbalanced access to care and disruptive technologies.\n\nFrom a holistic perspective, the goal is to provide quality healthcare to all Singaporeans. Besides financial aid, subsidies and increasing premiums based on affordability, the government can also consider technologies and innovations that help improve the quality of care, reduce costs and, most important, improve patient outcomes.\n\nWe are working with healthcare providers in Singapore and across the region, looking at a combination of programmes and initiatives which have the ability to make a significant difference in all these areas. These include technology to support:\n\n(1) Proactive patient outreach: to improve patient outcomes and increase public awareness;\n\n(2) Workflow automation: to reduce process inefficiency and deliver cost and time savings, resulting in faster response to patient needs;\n\n(3) Mobile collaboration: equip staff with next-gen communications capabilities that help accelerate all aspects of care-giving;\n\n(4) Telemedicine: helps remove geographic barriers and make care available to all;\n\n(5) Big Data analytics: to help anticipate macro trends and accelerate individual diagnosis; and\n\n(6) A secure, flexible and reliable network infrastructure: the backbone of effective 21st century healthcare provision.\n\nLaletha Nithiyanandan\n\nManaging Director\n\nTalent Design Potential\n\nI BELIEVE the enhanced benefits will address previous concerns with regard to healthcare costs. The result of higher premiums is a small price to pay, particularly considering that the government will provide assistance. As an employer, the one percentage-point increase in Medisave contributions can amount to quite a significant cost. On the flip side, however, employers could end up paying a lot more than this one percentage-point in employee health costs, with an ageing population.\n\nThe advantage here is that insurance tends to give us collective savings on costs; also, knowing this now gives us (both employers and individuals) lead time to start planning. I believe that we can further ease the rising costs by using this as an opportunity to encourage preventive care - for instance, going for check-ups earlier or promoting healthy living and health improvement nationwide.\n\nInstead of preparing for large hospital bills, we can attempt to minimise the chances of getting warded. By promoting a healthier lifestyle and creating a healthier nation, we lower the general hospitalisation rate and, eventually, premium rates as well.\n\nLance Tay\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nTokio Marine Life Insurance Singapore\n\nDEVELOPED countries like Singapore are faced with a common challenge - providing affordable healthcare and adequate coverage to an ageing population. While MediShield has been effective, the proposed MediShield Life is more nimble as it considers the needs of lower and middle-income families. Changes include raising the annual claim limits and lowering the co-payments for increasingly common procedures such as chemotherapy, so one can afford large medical bills. Out-of-pocket expenses will also be minimised because of higher claim limits. With the various subsidies and increased funding support for the lower income group, MediShield Life will help cushion the impact of rising healthcare cost.\n\nThe recommended changes to MediShield means some parts of the bill originally covered by the integrated shield plans are now within the scope of MediShield Life. It will be interesting to see how this pre-funding model works out when affordability remains a key concern.\n\nHealthcare cost has seen an inflation of 160 per cent in 30 years (1983-2013) - the highest among all categories measured, for example education, housing and transport. With the more comprehensive coverage of MediShield Life, over-consumption of healthcare services may happen and that could further raise healthcare costs.\n\nThis means healthcare affordability in the long term can be a concern, which may lead some people to downgrade their health insurance plans when they are older. This is obviously not advisable. At Tokio Marine Life Insurance Singapore, we understand that healthcare financing is also about ensuring you have adequate funds to cope with rising healthcare costs. Hence, ensuring a lifetime retirement income stream by having suitable retirement insurance products can help ease the financial burden.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPLAN-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\nTHE proposed new MediShield Life scheme certainly goes far enough on the supply side, to address concerns about rising healthcare costs in our ageing population. However, government, businesses and individuals will now have to focus more on the demand side, to ensure that all three key stakeholders will not be overly taxed in funding the scheme. It starts with individuals taking greater personal ownership of their health and wellbeing, especially those with chronic illnesses.\n\nI would even advocate that those who cannot be insured and who will now be covered by MediShield Life, commit to taking steps to manage their chronic health conditions. The government can help by facilitating, for example, comprehensive nationwide telehealth services. Such services have proved to be effective in chronic disease management, wellness management, care for the aged and help for care-givers, in addition to triage management, in countries such as Australia and New Zealand.\n\nBusinesses must entrench work-life balance in the workplace more than ever, to ensure that employees do not fall ill as a result of excessive work stress. The government has been magnanimous as the single largest contributor to this new MediShield Life scheme. The ball is now in the court of businesses and individuals to play their part. I contend that when businesses truly practise work-life harmony, that extra Medisave contribution can be kept within the proposed one percentage point, if not reduced.\n\nWhen more individuals take personal ownership of their health, the demand on healthcare (and, hence, healthcare cost per capita) can be better managed and funded. What is clear is that government, businesses and individuals can and must play their respective parts responsibly and collaboratively, to balance demand and supply of the new MediShield Life scheme. It is an imperative that must be achieved to avoid opening a Pandora's box in healthcare financing.\n\nChris Comer\n\nCEO\n\nCastlewood Group\n\nTHE newly enhanced MediShield Life scheme is a welcome and much needed change due to the evolving needs of our nation. As with any change in policy or government direction, we should anticipate that some critics will challenge the increase in premiums versus the increase in benefits.\n\nThe government must take these factors into consideration when educating Singaporeans on the wide scope of benefits and offer complete transparency into the running costs of the scheme. Educating people on why changes need to be made will also help the younger generation understand the importance of forward planning for retirement.\n\nWhat we, as a nation, have to remember is that these socio-economic changes are unprecedented and this first step to tackling the ageing population issue will most certainly not be the last.\n\nWhile the government has done right to take on a lot of the associated costs with the various subsidies, employers will also be responsible for increasing employee contributions. Companies operating here must support the growing needs of their employees.\n\nAt Castlewood Group, the health and economic wellbeing of our staff is paramount to us. However, recently employers seem to be bearing the brunt of various changes to regulations. As a company, it is our responsibility to support our employees but the government must take into account the ever-rising costs of operating a business in Singapore.\n\nWhile it might be sustainable for some businesses to take on these costs right now, how long can this last? By all means, the government has made the right decision to tackle an issue that is at the forefront of the minds of most Singaporeans. But I don't see this being a complete solution as there are a number of factors that need to be considered aside from medical bills alone.\n\nAnnie Yap\n\nManaging Director\n\nAYP Associates Pte Ltd\n\nTHE new MediShield Life is a welcome change, especially when it provides coverage to Singaporeans with pre-existing illnesses. It is almost near impossible for people with pre-existing illnesses to look for insurance coverage. However, with MediShield Life, it will help ease the burden for these people. Moreover, given the rise in the cost of medical services as Singapore faces an ageing population and the enhanced coverage under MediShield Life, the higher premiums are justified to ensure that bills can be fully subsidised.\n\nAs our lifespan increases, MediShield Life eases concerns about the lack of savings to cope with medical bills in our twilight years. Another issue that the government can consider is possibly hedging against inflation to ensure that the premiums paid remain sufficient against claims.\n\nThirumalai Chandroo\n\nChairman/CEO\n\nModern Montessori International Group\n\nWE have one of the most stable healthcare systems around. The measures undertaken now are a rehaul towards making medical healthcare more affordable for Singaporeans. With a growing ageing population it is pertinent to prepare for increasing medical expenses now rather than later. As with any policy there will be areas of concerns that some may have such as affordability for the premiums. It also raises the issue of rising costs for employers; this may result in more Singaporeans getting lower salaries in some industries.\n\nAll societies have to make choices between how generally to provide access to fundamental and advanced healthcare, how much to pay for healthcare and how much and which innovations to make available to their people. These very likely have to be efficient and affordable. Better treatments simply mean higher costs; hence, I feel it is the balance between advanced medical treatment and affordable healthcare that Singaporeans are striving for. Larger withdrawal amounts from the Medisave will prove extremely useful only for the elderly who may live alone and require heightened medical care. As an employer, I believe it is important to also look at cost for patient-centric care in time to come, and educate Singaporeans on wellness and prevention of major illnesses to reduce the need for acute care later on.\n\nRobin C Lee\n\nGroup COO\n\nBok Seng Group\n\nWHILE Singaporeans are living longer, for many, it may not necessarily be more good years of healthy living. Indeed, as one lives longer, the cost of maintaining and sustaining one's life will inevitably escalate. Living in a country that has one of the highest cost of living in the world does not help either. Fortunately, the entire medical scheme put forth by the government thus far is a move in the right direction to ensure that Singaporeans receive the proper healthcare they need. What we need to do now is to focus on mandating a healthy lifestyle and not merely encouraging it. By that, I mean we should abstain from habits such as over-consumption of unhealthy food, smoking and vices that may hurt our body.\n\nAs we live longer, we want to do so in a fulfilling way and not just clock the years. Health is thus of utmost importance to every one of us. In my view, I think the government should pick up the medical expense tab for any citizen above the average age of, say, 84 years for women and 82 years for men. I feel that due to the rising costs of healthcare at that age, the government could really lend a helping hand to those most in need. But it is imperative to note that medical subsidies address only the problem, but not the root of the problem. Medicine alone is not enough to ensure a healthy and fulfilling life; it must also be accompanied by a healthy outlook in life, both in practice and mind.\n\nDavid Leong\n\nManaging Director\n\nPeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd\n\nTHE new shift in healthcare financial framework is significant in that it allows for larger claim sums, has no limit on claims over one's lifetime and co-payment sums are substantially reduced. These were the bugbears of the old MediShield regime. As Singaporeans age, cost of medical care and medical consumption will tend to increase.\n\nMore allowable coverage for outpatient treatments should be included and Singaporeans should not have to worry about the rising costs of care and prescriptive medicine. So long as the medical care and prescriptions fall within the ambit of geriatric medicine, claims should be considered, and it will be helpful if the framework can highlight and make known the areas of coverage. With MediShield Life, healthcare coverage will be deeper and more inclusive. The increase in premiums will not hit hard as there will be top-ups and case-by-case reviews. An open assurance by the government will put hearts at ease.\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nONE of the biggest concerns among Singaporeans is the rising cost of healthcare and, in particular, the fear of being slapped with a hefty medical or hospital bill in one's later years as critical illnesses such as cancer become more common. The proposed new MediShield Life scheme will help to alleviate this concern, as the insurance will cover a higher claim limit while patient co-payments will also be reduced. Under this scheme, pre-existing illnesses will also be covered and all Singaporeans will enjoy lifetime coverage. These are great strides forward. But if the enhanced scheme - with higher premiums - is made compulsory, what will happen if a person's Medisave funds run out? Over the course of time, the compulsory payment of higher premiums means that the person's Medisave savings will diminish and perhaps run out, especially for a retiree. If the person is a housewife or only able to work part-time, there may not be much in the Medisave account to begin with. What if these people do not have family members who can help top up their Medisave accounts? Would their coverage cease entirely?\n\nThese are practical considerations that the public needs to be aware of but such details will only be released at a later stage. Besides hospital bills, another area of concern is the growing need for long-term care in the future. Today, couples are generally having fewer (if any) children and there is a higher percentage of singles who simply don't wish to get married. Decades from now, there will be greater demand for nursing homes and assisted living facilities, which will be costly. As a nation, how are we preparing for that and will our citizens be financially prepared for such heavy expenses in their golden years?\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A recent survey, however, showed that within the Asia-Pacific region, Singapore had the biggest gap between customer expectations and the ability of businesses to provide the level of CEM technology support required to meet the need.\n\nThe survey was commissioned by business communications solutions provider Avaya. More than 1,500 business managers were interviewed across 13 countries for the survey. The findings indicated a direct correlation between technology and customer satisfaction.\n\nThe study investigated the emphasis that companies are putting on CEM and found that increasingly high expectations of customers are creating a business environment where a majority of organisations are struggling to keep up.\n\nSome of its key findings:\n\nTalking about the Singapore findings, Lee Chong-Win, Avaya's Asean managing director, told BizIT that while 95 per cent of businesses here believe that \"customer effort\" - i.e. how easy a company makes it for customers to do business with it - has an impact on customer spending, retention and satisfaction, only 37 per cent actually deploy customer effort initiatives.\n\nSingapore also saw the biggest gap in the region in being able to link, in real- time, all threads of communication across different channels - 73 per cent of customers expect businesses to be able to do this across different channels (for example web, phone and social media) but only 35 per cent of Singapore companies actually do so.\n\nMr Lee added that, apart from the above, the top three challenges businesses in Singapore face in implementing CEM are:\n\n\"Singapore thrives on the service industry, which contributes to at least 70 per cent of Singapore's economy. In a market that relies so heavily on service, 68 per cent of consumers expect brands to treat them as unique and automatically deliver communications tailored to the individual's preference. (But) only 39 per cent of businesses are actually able to support this demand,\" Mr Lee said.\n\nImpediments\n\nHe added that businesses in Singapore have a strong understanding of the need for CEM strategy. With strong government initiatives in place, Singaporean companies are actually well placed to deliver stronger customer service.\n\n\"Based on the Avaya survey, businesses in Singapore do not see technology limitations and buy-in from top management as top reasons preventing them from delivering personalised customer experience.\"\n\nMr Lee, however, noted that one of the main impediments is ownership. When too many different departments think they own part of the customer experience, and there is a lack of a single executive-level owner, the result is often fragmented or badly implemented programmes.\n\n\"This creates communication barriers between different functions, especially where there has not been a holistic view taken of the technology required to support an end-to-end customer experience,\" he said.\n\n\"Of course, budgets remain an issue for some, but the findings from the Avaya survey demonstrate how quickly an effective CEM strategy can start to deliver tangible results and, with a well-managed programme, those returns will only grow over time.\"\n\nMr Lee added that companies in Singapore need to look at their systems and ensure that they are joined up so that customers' past history and context are captured and used to help tailor services and responses.\n\n\"More importantly, companies must provide their staff with instant access to that information, regardless of which platform they are on, so their interactions can be personalised and relevant.\n\n\"Larger enterprises must ensure that their inbound and outbound customer contact systems are linked so that notifications are relevant and timely.\"\n\nHe added that countries such as China, India and Mexico have seen the significant impact that customer effort initiatives can have on business, and that has also resulted in a much lower gap between customer expectations and company ability to deliver - 33 per cent, 34 per cent and 37 per cent, respectively, in those countries, compared to Singapore, where the gap is at 58 per cent.\n\nMr Lee noted that there are significant CEM areas which have been overlooked by businesses in Singapore. The survey findings revealed that, despite 90 per cent of consumers expecting brands to provide automatic notification of potential problems so that proactive solutions can be offered, only 42 per cent actually do so.\n\n\"This gives a clear indication of the opportunities that businesses in Singapore can leverage to better cater to customers' demands. Specifically, in order to truly feel they are having a great customer experience, customers want to feel as though they are being treated as unique individuals with communications tailored specifically to them,\" Mr Lee added.\n\namit@sph.com.sg\n\n@AmitRoyCBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By HENRY TAN\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jun 15, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nFOR such a critical function, internal audit is too often regarded as simply a box to tick on management's list of operational things to do. In actuality, the Singapore Code of Corporate Governance requires companies to establish an effective internal audit function that is adequately resourced and independent of the activities it audits (Principle 13). A more pressing call is how a company should approach its internal audit options to best fit its corporate structure and requirements. Essentially, there are three primary options: in-house, outsourced, or co-sourced.\n\nIn-house\n\nIn-house internal audits rely solely on company resources, staff and expertise.\n\nFor smaller companies, this option may simply not reap the necessary cost efficiencies available to larger players which can invest in the dedicated development of an internal audit department.\n\nHowever, the benefits of the in-house option certainly include the internal familiarity with the company's business, and the strength of better networks and working relationships within the company.\n\nAdditionally, internal auditors can be groomed or they can be rotated to other departments, expanding their internal control knowledge throughout the organisation. The presence of such auditors also creates awareness of the crucial role internal audit plays in a company's operations.\n\nOutsourced\n\nHere, a company may delegate its internal audit function to an external service provider, usually one of the public accounting firms other than its external auditor.\n\nA company may opt to go this route because of a lack of qualified internal resources and technical or specialty knowledge required, or just because the size of the organisation is simply too small to sustain an in-house team.\n\nOutsourcing may then be both cost effective and provide for necessary independence.\n\nOne negative aspect of outsourcing is that the depth of the internal audit may be less thorough as the outsourced team is usually with the client for a shorter period.\n\nThe Institute of Internal Auditors offers a valuable caveat for companies that choose to outsource: oversight and responsibility for the internal audit activity cannot be outsourced.\n\nAn in-house liaison, preferably an executive or senior management employee, should be responsible for \"managing\" the internal audit activity. And the independence of the assigned in-house liaison must be evaluated if this individual has other (non-internal audit) responsibilities.\n\nCo-sourced\n\nCo-sourcing involves in-house internal auditors being the primary resource for executing the company's internal audit plan while engaging an external service provider, particularly in a specialised area, to provide the necessary support or to boost cost efficiency.\n\nCo-sourcing can create a synergy that complements the strength of an in-house internal audit team and enables it to tap the broad capabilities available from an external service provider.\n\nIt also allows an internal audit department to pursue value added services that it otherwise could not do itself because of a lack of resources, time or capabilities.\n\nThis option may also save the company money because routine audit work may be less costly if provided by external service providers.\n\nA 2013 survey conducted by the Singapore Accountancy Commission and consultancy firm KPMG indicates that 44 per cent of chief audit executives view co-sourcing as the most cost-efficient means of obtaining a diverse range of skill sets that may not be fully utilised in an in-house context.\n\nMulti-pronged approach\n\nThe decision on the most appropriate option for a company relies on factors such as company size, structure, resources and management culture.\n\nSome companies move on to different options as their organisations evolve or grow. One example of a large organisation that creatively worked out an effective solution for its internal audit needs is the Ministry of Health Holdings (MOHH), the holding company of the various public healthcare entities.\n\nIn 2010, after an extensive internal review and consultation and given its size, MOHH consolidated its internal audit function across the entire group.\n\nInternal auditors from its subsidiaries which had in-house teams were transferred to a central internal audit department within the holding company.\n\nIn effect, the subsidiaries which previously had their own internal audit function then \"outsourced\" this function to the head office.\n\nAt the same time, the internal audit department at the head office also \"co-sourced\" specific functions, such as a whistle-blowing hotline, to external specialist service providers.\n\nBenefits\n\nMOHH found that the economies of scale of a central department provided for better management of and career progression for its large pool of internal audit staff.\n\nAt the same time, it achieved a higher level of independence of its internal auditors relative to the individual subsidiaries.\n\nIts use of specialist outsourced service providers also complemented and supplemented its internal resources.\n\nMOHH went further to create synergies and alignment at the board level by having the audit committee chairmen of its subsidiaries be members of the audit committee of the holding company.\n\nIn the final analysis, each company has to decide which option best serves its business practice. There is no clear-cut right or wrong answer.\n\nHowever it is organised or executed, the internal audit function should be designed to be effective for its purposes and comply not just with the letter and form of regulations, but also the spirit and substance of it.\n\nThe writer is a member of the Professional Development Committee of the Singapore Institute of Directors\n\nFor more articles, go to\n\nbtd.sg/BMatters\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

China was among the five most sought-after markets for retailers looking to open stores this year, a separate report by the broker, released in March, showed.\n\nUBS already invests directly in Chinese residential property through a joint venture formed in 2008 with Shenzhen-based developer Gemdale Corp. The bank is planning a second residential fund, with an initial close of about US$100 million and a total of at least US$350 million, Mr Cooke said.\n\n\"It's hard not to acknowledge the macro sentiment around residential property in China right now, the concerns about a Chinese bubble,\" Mr Cooke said. \"But that just puts the emphasis on the asset management credentials.\"\n\nChina's home sales fell 11 per cent in May from a year earlier. The value of homes sold declined to 446.1 billion yuan (S$89.6 billion) from 503 billion yuan in the same month in 2013, according to National Statistics Bureau data.\n\nUBS plans to offer clients the option of investing in Chinese property using either US dollars or yuan, Mr Cooke said.\n\nThe bank, which has about US$66.4 billion of real estate under management globally, is also expanding in Australia through a joint venture with Melbourne-based developer Grocon Pty and through an agricultural partnership announced last week with closely held agricultural advisory company Bydand Global Agriculture.\n\nUBS Grocon Real Estate is targeting as much as A$750 million (S$880.2 million) of assets under management by the end of this year, including Grocon developments, Mr Cooke said. The joint venture, which plans to have A$10 billion under management in five years, hasn't announced any investments yet.\n\nUBS Grocon gives the bank the first right of refusal on the builder's A$2 billion pipeline, the latest addition to which is the Commonwealth Games village on Queensland state's Gold Coast. Grocon won the right to be preferred developer of that project in December.\n\nUBS will team up with Bydand to help match investor demand with farms in need of equity capital.\n\n\"The Australian agricultural sector is carrying too much debt, and a significant amount of farmers are sub-scale and need an exit,\" Mr Cooke said. \"Farmland provides a great portfolio diversifier and, structured right, it damps volatility and initial demand from clients in all parts of the world seems very strong.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

Its passage would allow the finance minister - currently Prime Minister Najib Razak - to set up an investment panel within the Inland Revenue Board (IRB). The passage of the bill would enable the panel to invest taxpayers' funds into equities, initial public offerings, bonds, debt paper, and even property assets. The bill would give the finance minister the power to appoint six of the seven members of the investment panel. The seventh would be the governor of the central bank, currently Zeti Akhtar Aziz.\n\nThe function of the IRB is to maximise the collection of tax revenue for the government, pure and simple. It is certainly not to invest taxpayers' funds in potentially risky assets. In any case, the government has already got at least 10 investment funds and sovereign wealth funds including the Employees Provident Fund (RM600 billion in assets), Permodalan Nasional Berhad (RM237 billion) and Khazanah Nasional (RM135 billion). All these funds have been around for a long time and have been generally transparent and fully accountable.\n\nIf the government wanted to increase the investment of its funds, it should simply increase its allocation to Khazanah. In any case, how much spare cash does the IRB have lying around anyway? It can't be very much given that the government expects to run a budget deficit of 3 per cent of gross domestic product this year.\n\nLast year, the Board contributed roughly 55 per cent, or around RM120 billion (S$46.5 billion), of total government revenue. The difference between what it collects and what it disburses to government coffers can't be very much. The IRB has, however, a short-term holding fund for tax refunds, which it eventually pays out. It's not entirely clear just how much the fund amounts to, but the 2011 report indicated that it paid out over RM5 billion in refunds. The same report indicated that the Board had RM255 million in fixed deposits and money-market instruments from which it booked investment income of almost RM9 million. But those aren't risky investments, just routine treasury operations to preserve the value of surplus funds.\n\nAt the core of the hullabaloo and the opposition to the proposed bill is the notion that it would transform the IRB into an investment body, much like 1MDB that is directly under the control of the finance minister. And numerous press reports have made it quite clear that the quasi-sovereign wealth fund has had a less than stellar reputation for transparency or accountability.\n\nThere might have been a case - and it is still a weak one at that - for such a body to be established had the government been running budget surpluses for a considerable period of time. But there is none whatsoever at a time when the government has been nursing a deficit for 16 straight years. And to expose excess funds that have claims on them, such as uncollected tax refunds, to the vagaries of the marketplace is quite possibly sheer folly.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But these pains may soon be a thing of the past, according to Michael Tan, co-founder of Singapore health start-up BioSenze.\n\nHe says help will come in the form of BioSenze's do-it-yourself diagnostic kit, which will allow patients to administer up to 200 common health tests from the comfort of their own homes, using their blood, urine or saliva samples.\n\nThese tests include those for top-of-mind diseases such as hand, foot & mouth, dengue fever and tuberculosis, as well as the measuring of regular glucose and cholesterol levels, and even one's daily platelet count.\n\nTo run a test, a patient will have to plug BioSenze's biometric device into his smartphone's earphone jack, open the free BioSenze app on his smartphone to power the device, and then position the device's suction tube over his fluid sample. Once that is absorbed and tested, the device will deliver results accordingly: positive or negative readings (for instance, for dengue fever), or metered readings (for glucose level).\n\nMetered readings can even be sent to doctors, hospitals and healthcare platforms for regular monitoring, via a cloud server.\n\nBioSenze's kit - comprising the biometric device and mobile app - will be the world's first, claims Mr Tan.\n\n\"It will potentially revolutionise the way medical assessments are conducted, and drastically simplify doctor-patient consultation - by enabling cheaper, faster and better testing, and by putting patients' needs first.\"\n\nThe biometric device, which will retail in pharmacies for not more than $10, will be about 28 times cheaper than the cost of an average health screening package in Singapore, Mr Tan adds.\n\nIt will also be ten times faster, with the ability to deliver test results in under 10 minutes - compared to two hours or even up to five days, which is the time typically taken by clinics and hospitals here.\n\n\"Moreover, BioSenze's kit is portable, has an accuracy of over 90 per cent, and is able to recommend related tests to provide patients with a more comprehensive health evaluation,\" Mr Tan says.\n\nBioSenze's ultimate goal is to have global health institutions embrace its kit, and doctors prescribe it - for daily testing - to their patients, which will relieve the patients of the inconvenience of having to make their way down to clinics or hospitals for tests.\n\nThe kit can also be deployed in the event of an epidemic or natural disaster, Mr Tan said.\n\nBioSenze, which launched last December, has since filed its patents and is currently awaiting certification for its biometric device from the authorities.\n\nIt will officially launch its kit at CommunicAsia 2014 - an information and communications technology trade event - later this week, with plans to expand into Asia, Europe and the US.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Methinks Sofitel So Singapore took that rule book and tossed it out of the window, along with other adjectives such as \"sleek\", \"elegant\", \"minimalist\" and \"tasteful\".\n\nInstead, this hospitality upstart in the financial district is a full-on visual assault the moment you step in. This is no lobby - it looks more like the aftermath of a kamikaze attack by a grand piano. The glossy ebony-ivory colour theme is broken up in haphazard pattern, splattered with splotches of blood red rose displays, shiny glass and twinkling hexagonal light fixtures that remind you of Christmas trees or an SOS flare.\n\nWhether you like or hate this display of psychedelic, groovy ostentation, you are at least guaranteed an experience, which, on the dining front at least, the inhouse restaurant Xperience offers.\n\nTaking up almost half the lobby space, it's equally OTT with its head-pounding pulsating techno-pop (there's even an inhouse DJ spinning the decks) music, crystal-embedded glass table tops, rich velvet upholstery and plush cushions - along with a blue neon lit \"bed\" that acts as the chef's table. Breakfast in bed, get it?\n\nAgainst this backdrop - and a droolworthy Molteni kitchen set-up - lady chef Anne-Cecile Degenne needs to do more than your garden variety all-day dining to stand out. That's why you get this quirky menu that's designed to look like a chef's notebook with whimsical sketches of cooking and hand-written notes. Instead of the usual demarcations of starter, mains and desserts, you get \"crunchy\", \"zesty\", \"smoky\", \"spicy\" and \"juicy\". The menu designer must have run out of steam because dessert is described as, well, \"dessert\".\n\nBesides choosing your desired taste sensation, you can also tailor the size of your meal, from XS (tasting), XM (single portion) to XL (sharing portion). It gives you the flexibility to try a lot more things than you would normally do, and the tasting portions are decent enough to share between two people.\n\nChef Degenne's food leans towards East-West fusion and somehow manages to make it less pretentious than the surroundings. In fact, the food is probably the most grounded aspect of the hotel with its unpretentious, wholesome approach to cooking - so you're not going to find anything associated with the avant-garde or molecular movement here. Also, don't expect to find authentic renditions of local favourites, although the menu is peppered with familiar names such as siew mai, laksa, curry and chilli crab. It would be silly to expect chef Degenne to emulate the methods or flavours that local diners would just call her out on. None of the dishes tastes like the real thing, but what you can appreciate is the way they stand on their own for pure tastiness.\n\nFoie gras and truffle siew mai ($15 for two in the XS serving) looks like the real thing apart from the familiar scent of truffle oil mixed into a bouncy, fluffy foie gras and mushroom mixture encased in the skin, with a blink-and-you-miss-it flake of truffle on top of each dumpling. Pleasantly earthy in flavour from the mix of fungi and liver, it's the delicate juices at the bottom of the dish that taste almost like a mild herbal soup that pique our interest.\n\nMeanwhile, seared pork knuckle ($12 for XS) is stripped of bone and fashioned into a rectangular terrine of shredded pork and gelatinous bits panfried on each side to achieve a good crusty exterior with tender meat inside. Paired with marinated vegetable cubes and sliced radish, it passes muster.\n\nLess successful is the chipotle chilli crab tacos ($24 for XM) with its bland mixture of crabmeat tossed with tomatoes and chilli piled into a tender warm taco and topped with shredded cabbage slaw. While we're no fan of the filling, we're won over by the taco's chewy tender texture and homemade taste. Switch the filling to something else and we're sold.\n\nWe're pleasantly surprised by the charcoal eggplant, organic grains and ricotta ($18 for XM) - one of the few choices not influenced by local cuisine. The eggplant's distinctive smokiness adds to the pleasure of chewing on plump barley, assorted grains and the melting-soft eggplant, rounded off with tangy ricotta cheese.\n\nNot all will be enamoured of the lobster and scallop laksa risotto ($39 for XM) - but not because it doesn't taste like laksa. Rather, its al dente rice texture (with a slightly uncooked core which defines al dente as \"firm to the bite\") may not sit well with those used to thoroughly cooked rice. As for the laksa comparison, it tastes more like curried bisque with shredded laksa leaves, but the foundation stock is rich in flavour, and you get a good portion of scallop and meaty lobster claw. The downside is that risotto needs to be eaten really quickly or it gets stodgy, and the restaurant's air-conditioning speeds up its transformation into a gloopy, stodgy affair very fast.\n\nHolding out better is the roasted lamb, lentil and coconut curry ($14 for a surprisingly big portion for XS). Pink lamb slices are served alongside a mild, fragrant lentil curry that stands out for the texture of the lentils - they're still whole and tender rather than turned into a creamy mash - although we would prefer more coconut milk in the curry itself, not in fancy swirls of foamy white sauce that's obtrusively salty-sour and detracts from the rest of the good stuff.\n\nDesserts are passable affairs with an interesting lemon curd and marshmallow combination with fun pop rocks ($15) and \"decadent chocolate\" ($19) that features a smoky chocolate ice cream with an odd aftertaste paired with sticky chocolate ganache and crispy wafers.\n\nExpect service to be slow and somewhat inexperienced. Can't really blame them, though. When you're working in a disco ball of a hotel, it's bound to be a distracting experience.\n\nRating:\n\n7\n\nWHAT OUR RATINGS MEAN\n\n10: The ultimate dining experience\n\n9-9.5: Sublime\n\n8-8.5: Excellent\n\n7-7.5: Good to very good\n\n6-6.5: Promising\n\n5-5.5: Average\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But they will be there. This is not political activism. This is the showing of pain and outrage from a people whose deepest love has been prostituted.\n\nMore than one-fifth of all Brazilians live on less than US$2 a day and still love their football. When the country was awarded the World Cup, they partied like there was no tomorrow. But tomorrow came - and it was a nightmare.\n\nRed card\n\nFifa ordered stadiums built to its specifications. Twelve new and refurbished structures started to take shape, but the favelas,\n\nor shantytowns, of the poor were in their way. Some 250,000 homes were bulldozed.\n\nAll for a good cause?\n\nThen, came the bills. Brazil, with its rutted roads and crumbling bridges, spent US$11.7 billion on the project. But Fifa was not satisfied. \"Brazil needs a kick up its backside,\" said a Fifa official, who was unhappy with the pace of construction.\n\nThen came the revelations. An auditor's report showed that out of the US$900 million spent on Brasilia's World Cup stadium, there was price-gouging to the tune of US$275 million. Builders, for example, billed the government US$1.5 million to transport prefabricated grandstands - an operation that costs just US$4,700, according to auditors.\n\nWhy were these inflated claims approved? One explanation is that the developers have suddenly ramped up their donations to political parties. After contributing just US$73,180 to politicians in 2008, one stadium builder upped its donations to US$37 million last year - 500 times more.\n\nSet play\n\nAnd then came the bullying. A festival that has been held on the streets of Rio de Janeiro every World Cup for 32 years was all set to show games on a public screen, when Fifa sent its organisers a US$10,000 bill for breaching broadcasting rights. Local snack sellers were told to take their business away from streets around the stadium to protect McDonald's, a sponsor.\n\nBrazil had a law banning beer inside stadiums to stop unruly fans from attacking each other. This was scrapped because Budweiser is a sponsor.\n\nMeanwhile, Fifa made a tax-free profit of US$1.1 billion on the event.\n\nBrazilians protested. A new anti-terror law was passed to quell the uproar. Some 170,000 security men are being deployed to ensure this, and 27 protesters have died since last year.\n\nSorry, Bill Shankly. You said: \"Some people believe football is a matter of life and death . . . I can assure you it is much, much more important than that.\"\n\nThis is a matter of life and death. Somehow, football seems less important.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The same time last year, six mainboard listings raised $3.5 billion from their IPOs.\n\n\"We see a trend of companies looking for private fund-raising,\" said Tay Toh Sin, head of corporate finance at OCBC, referring to private investors such as Asian-based institutional funds. Companies want to shun the current market volatility too, she added.\n\nThe expected rise in interest rate, as the US Federal Reserve unwinds its stimulus programme, has had two key effects. Companies may choose to turn to cheap funding now, and lock in rates, rather than turn to the capital markets, said Ms Tay. It explains why there may be more Catalist listings than mega IPOs on the mainboard, given that smaller companies with a relatively poorer credit rating or history may find it tougher to get debt.\n\nThere have been four Catalist listings so far, one more than those listed at the same time last year.\n\nThe attention on higher rates now also means that real estate investment trusts (Reits) - a mainstay of the Singapore market - are less attractive today. The six mainboard listings in the first half of the year included two Reits and one business trust. \"There is still a window, but the Reit issuers are mindful of how quickly the window may be shut,\" noted Ms Tay.\n\nThis comes as many investors have stayed at the sidelines to look for \"extremely attractive\" pricing, said Tan Jeh Wuan, DBS's head of capital markets in Singapore.\n\nAlso, many potential listings are companies with strong balance sheets and cash flows, and are therefore not in a hurry to sell their shares at giveaway prices, he added.\n\n\"We are beginning to see some investors coming back, especially in the Reits space. Issuers are also becoming more realistic in pricing and hopefully this will help bridge the valuation gap and enable IPOs to be done,\" he said. \"We are optimistic that the IPO market will be more active in the second half, given the pipeline built up from deals deferred in the first half.\"\n\nThe hushed IPO market could also be stirred by more oil-and-gas listings, as investors expect oil prices to stay healthy, said OCBC's Ms Tay.\n\nThe largest mainboard listing this year is PACC Offshore Services Holdings, which raised $388 million through its IPO.\n\nNotably, IPO volumes in Asia historically pick up significantly in the second half of the year, pointed out Neil Kell, Deutsche Bank's head of equity capital markets in Asia. \"We should see this pattern repeat itself in 2014. The second half of 2014 will see several large transactions coming to market with the likes of Alibaba, WH Group, and 1MDB, which could potentially take the volumes higher than ever on record.\"\n\nMergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity in Singapore and the region is also likely to keep pace in the second half of the year, on the back of easy credit and compelling valuations of target companies.\n\nSingapore stood out as the top acquirer country in South-east Asia with a record total of US$24 billion in cross-border M&A deals under its belt thus far, figures from Dealogic showed. This is also double the US$12.2 billion in M&A deals announced in the same period a year ago.\n\n\"The confidence in the long-term macro environment, benign credit markets, and the desire to expand or diversify has encouraged local acquirers to look more actively for the M&A option, which has not always been the case,\" said Mayooran Elalingam, Deutsche Bank's head of M&A in Asia.\n\nThere is some anticipation that Australian and Japanese investors may swoop in to shop, noted OCBC's Ms Tay. Some Australian resources and property firms are looking to diversify into the South-east Asian region.\n\nJapanese corporates, meanwhile, have made public their ambitions to spend cash spilling over their coffers, estimated at over 220 trillion yen (S$2.7 trillion).\n\nPart of the activity could be driven by private equity funds, too. Singapore was the most active private equity market in South-east Asia last year, with the deal value at US$3 billion, a Bain & Company report last month showed.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 13, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nYOU wear the clothes. Why not write in the notebooks or eat off the plates? That seems to be the business game plan of fashion labels which are branching out into the lifestyle business.\n\nThe latest to do so in Singapore is Kate Spade New York, which launched its Stationery and Gifts collection on Wednesday at novelty store Monoyono in Plaza Singapura.\n\nThe Kate Spade New York Stationery and Gift collection was launched in the United States last autumn, and is a partnership with fine gifts and accessories specialist Lifeguard Press.\n\nLike its name implies, the collection comprises writing instruments, notebooks, greeting cards and desk accessories, as well as plates, glasses and napkins and even a picnic mat.\n\nIn line with the quintessential Kate Spade spirit, the items feature bold and colourful prints and motifs.\n\nCharm of writing\n\nWith the stationery collection, Benny Low, managing director of Trendspot, which owns Monoyono, says: \"We want to bring back the charm of writing in today's digital world, where typing and tweeting have become the norm.\"\n\nHe is confident that the lifestyle collection will appeal to existing Kate Spade fans. \"But those who aren't will probably also want to buy a piece or two for their friends who already have Kate Spade bags,\" he notes.\n\nTodd Ferrier, president of Lifeguard Press, says fans can expect more in the next collection. \"We love the playful quotes that Kate Spade New York uses, and they have become iconic for the brand. We will continue to play on those quotes.\" Some of the quirky quotes include \"talk is chic\" and \"how the devil are you\".\n\nEarlier this year, Calvin Klein showcased pieces from its Home collection in an architectural installation, designed to serve as a \"concept house\" at the Old Kallang Airport.\n\nQuiet elegance\n\nThe Calvin Klein Home collection was started in 1995, when the designer could not find the right bedlinen that he wanted, according to Amy Mellen, the brand's creative director.\n\nThe collection is not yet available in Singapore, but it includes bedding, bath, dinnerware, tabletop, table linens, giftware and furniture. Like the fashion, the look of Home is about quiet luxury and elegance.\n\nThe two brands join the likes of Bottega Veneta and Hermes which have already dressed homes with their luxurious homeware.\n\nAs with the other labels, Bottega Veneta's home collection which was launched in 2006, evolved out of necessity. When its creative director Tomas Maier could not find specific furnishings for his residence or the retail stores which he decorated, he commissioned bespoke pieces. Then, he explains: \"People wanted to buy the bench that was in the window, and I said: 'No, we'll make you one.' And one thing led to the next.\"\n\nThe full range of Bottega Veneta Home Collection is launched every two years at Milan's Salone Del Mobile. Its latest range was launched in April, and will be available for sale from September, at Da Vinci Home Collection in Upper Bukit Timah Road.\n\nDa Vinci Home also carries home collections from other well-known fashion labels including Blumarine, Versace, Kenzo, Fendi and Armani. Jason Chua, Da Vinci Home's sales manager, says sales of home items from these brands have been positive. \"They appeal to those who are already familiar with the fashion side of the brand,\" he adds.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\n@TaySuanChiangBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/cpf-and-annoying-thing-about-compounding", "site_title": "CPF and the annoying thing about compounding", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nCPF and the annoying thing about compounding\n\nCompounded interest seems like a pipe dream because its effects only show in the final years, says CAI HAOXIANG\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jun 15, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nCOMPOUNDING interest will make you rich, they tell you. A cornerstone argument of personal finance and wealth managers, compounding interest - that is, money snowballing into Warren Buffett-like billions - is a seemingly unassailable argument for the need to save, and start early, and to invest with so and so or put your money in that financial product.\n\nJust let compounding work its magic, goes the argument.\n\nA popular rule of thumb to determine how long it takes for your money to double is known as the rule of 72. Essentially, take an interest rate, say 7 per cent a year. Divide 72 by that number - you get around 10. That means at a 7 per cent interest rate, your money will double every 10 years.\n\nSounds good? As 19th century Irish writer Oscar Wilde would say, the truth is rarely pure and never simple.\n\nThe most annoying thing about compounding is that its effects are only felt at the end.\n\nIn the words of the motto of a well-known boys' school here, \"the best is yet to be\".\n\nTheoretically, money makes more money. You gain interest on a sum of money one year, and gain interest on that interest the next in addition to interest on the original sum.\n\nThe truth of the matter is, compounding starts off painstakingly slow, and only becomes truly spectacular right at the end.\n\nAnd we all know what happens in the end, thanks to British economist John Maynard Keynes: \"In the long run, we are all dead.\"\n\nPeople can thus be forgiven for getting a little bit impatient with the compounding genie. All it makes are promises after promises without seeming to deliver much.\n\nThis is best illustrated with a current example.\n\nSingapore's own Central Provident Fund (CPF) has been in the hot spot lately for purportedly giving low returns, insufficient for Singaporeans to meet their retirement needs.\n\nAdding to the angst is the fear that more and more money will be locked away.\n\nCurrently, just about half of Singaporeans meet the minimum sum to qualify them for the maximum lifelong annuity payout called CPF Life. The minimum sum is now at $155,000.\n\nBut the government has said that most young Singaporean wage earners today will be able to meet the minimum sum by the time they retire, provided they buy property within their means.\n\nAn independent study on retirement commissioned by the Ministry of Manpower and conducted by National University of Singapore professors have also found that young workers today can replace their income upon retirement at rates similar to developed countries.\n\nSo why is there a disconnect? Why do the young feel that they will never be able to hit the minimum sum, even while studies have shown they can?\n\nPart of the answer, perhaps, lies in how compounding works.\n\nThere are two main accounts everybody has in the CPF to deal with retirement: the Ordinary Account (OA) and the Special Account (SA).\n\nAt age 55, money from the OA and SA is transferred to a newly created Retirement Account. Any monies in the RA in excess of the minimum sum can be withdrawn. Otherwise, the remainder is used to buy the CPF Life annuity.\n\nHowever, come age 55, people might not have enough in the OA to speak of.\n\nMoney there is typically withdrawn to buy a house, and then to upgrade to a bigger house, and so on.\n\nThat might leave the heavy-lifting for the minimum sum to the SA. The sum of money there, if you haven't lost it trading stocks, theoretically accumulates at a steady pace of at least 4 per cent a year.\n\nThe accumulation gets faster towards age 55 because the proportion of your wage that goes into the SA every month increases with age.\n\nIt starts at 6 per cent when you are below 35, and rises steadily, peaking at 9.5 per cent from age 50 to 55.\n\nFor a typical young person today, how much would he have in his account by age 55?\n\nBasic assumptions\n\nLet us assume our young chap starts off work earning the equivalent pay of a university graduate.\n\nThis is not an unreasonable assumption. About half of Singapore's 2.1 million strong resident labour force is currently either a diploma or equivalent holder (18.4 per cent) or degree holder (31.5 per cent), as of 2013.\n\nThe proportion of diploma and degree holders get larger if you zoom in to look at the data of younger age groups.\n\nOut of the 210,000 economically active residents aged 25 to 29 last June, over half, 106,000, are degree holders alone. Another quarter, or 53,000, have a diploma or professional qualification.\n\nAccording to the most recent graduate employment survey, the typical starting salary of a graduate is $3,000 a month.\n\nThe median wage of a typical resident, too, was at $3,250 a month last year.\n\nTo be conservative, let's start with a $3,000-a-month wage assumption, which adds up to $36,000 a year.\n\nTo be even more conservative, we don't factor in bonuses. No 13th month pay, no commissions, nothing.\n\nThe next assumption we have to make is how much wages rise by every year. Nominal wages have risen by an average of 4 to 5 per cent a year for the past five years, including the 2009 recession.\n\nAgain, let's peg wage rises conservatively at the core inflation rate of 2 per cent.\n\nOur average young worker thus begins working at age 26. By the end of his first year of work, he has $2,160 in his SA. So his SA increases by slightly more than $2,000 every year, plus interest.\n\nFast forward 10 years, at the end of age 35, and he has just $28,000.\n\nThis is still a far cry from the minimum sum, however. And it's been 10 years.\n\nEven at age 45, when another 10 years have passed, his SA stands at around $80,000.\n\nWho knows what the minimum sum will be, then? His SA is increasing at a faster pace, but it still seems slow, and it is still half of the minimum sum of about $160,000 today.\n\nSo it took us 20 whole years to get the first $80,000.\n\nBut something dramatic happens to the numbers in the last few years of compounding, further boosted by an increase in the SA contribution rate.\n\nThis assumes, of course, that our hypothetical male person keeps his job and does not have to take a pay cut.\n\nWhile it took 20 years to hit the first $80,000, it will take a mere 10 years to accumulate the next $100,000.\n\nWhen our chap is 55 years old, he will actually have more than $180,000 in his SA.\n\nWhile he accumulated just $2,000 to $3,000 in his SA every year in the beginning, the final two years will see him add $12,000 a year to his SA - all on conservative wage growth assumptions.\n\nThe way the numbers work is not intuitive. Nor can one easily understand the power of compounding from the vantage point of the 25-year-old, the 35-year-old, or even the 45-year-old.\n\nThe second most annoying thing\n\nThis sum of $180,000 will probably be lower than the minimum sum in 30 years' time.\n\nAssuming it increases by core inflation of 2 per cent every year, our fresh graduate will need close to $300,000 by the time he hits 55.\n\nThen again, the minimum sum might yet be met if we relax our conservative assumptions.\n\nWe also left out the role of the OA in providing for retirement savings altogether.\n\nAssuming he buys a modest-sized flat costing about $400,000 with his wife of a similar earning capacity and age, right at the beginning of his working career, it is entirely possible that the couple can pay off their mortgage by age 45.\n\nThat leaves an additional 10 years in which the OA will add at least $80,000 to one's savings, without factoring interest. This adds up to total retirement savings of around $260,000 in the CPF.\n\nAnd who knows, maybe he will get a promotion at work, and a pay rise in the earlier years. This leaves even more years for compounding to do its work.\n\nAnd so we get to the second most annoying thing about compounding: the assumptions you use matter a lot.\n\nThe way the math works is that any seemingly small change every year will add up to exponential growth over dozens of years.\n\nWage growth of just one more percentage point, for example, will add $30,000 to the SA and another $20,000 to the accumulated OA from age 45 to 55.\n\nIn an optimistic scenario where wage growth is also 5 per cent, one will have $285,000 in the SA at age 55, and have an extra $170,000 in the OA accumulated between age 45 and 55.\n\nThis is more than one and a half times that of our base case scenario.\n\nIf one tweaks starting salary to $4,000 a month and keeps wage growth at 5 per cent a year, you end up with $380,000 in the SA at age 55, and an extra $225,000 accumulated in the OA - more than enough where the minimum sum will probably be concerned.\n\nYoung investors and savers can thus draw a few lessons from how compounding works.\n\nFirst, don't expect to see results early.\n\nWhen you are rolling your snowball, the first 10, even 20 years will seem frustratingly slow. It is easy to get impatient and deviate from, say, a blue-chip, conservative investment strategy and take bigger punts with penny stocks that give you a higher chance of failing.\n\nStaying the course is more likely to reward.\n\nSecond, ensure your assumptions are conservative.\n\nBeing conservative has advantages. The chances of you being disappointed fall, and the chances of you being pleasantly surprised rises.\n\nSome investment schemes might promise returns of 10 per cent a year or more. Many pension funds in the US were operating on the assumption of 8 per cent returns a year. This is unrealistic, as many are finding out.\n\nA steady rate of return of around 4 per cent is probably safer.\n\nFinally, work hard to boost returns early on.\n\nGetting as high a starting salary as possible and socking as much away as possible to begin the process of compounding is probably the best strategy for younger folk hoping to retire comfortably before they are 55.\n\nWhatever you do, and whatever your aims, the returns might not seem like much at the start. Once critical mass is reached, however, they might seem more than enough.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

(These boots) are special because it has my family's names; they are my support.\"\n\nThe auction proceeds will go to The Business Times Budding Artists Fund - which helps underprivileged children aged five to 19 develop their talents in music, dance, theatre and the visual arts - and The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund, which gives a monthly stipend to students from low-income homes to help them with school-related expenses.\n\nEach of the 22 auction items has a minimum bid price. The Beckham boots, for instance, start at $1,250.\n\nAmong the other items are a set of boxing gloves signed by Manny Pacquiao and Brandon Rios, two caps signed by the main cast and director of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 movie, and a Manchester United jersey signed by ex-player Rio Ferdinand.\n\nSeven of these items will be auctioned off at the BT Dream Ball on Aug 1, a dinner event that will feature performances by international ballroom dancing champions.\n\nAll in, MBS hopes the funds raised from the auction and other events will surpass the $3.6 million raised from its inaugural festival last year.\n\nThe money will benefit various designated charities including the Singapore Association for the Deaf, Art Outreach Singapore and the Association for Persons with Special Needs.\n\nThose keen to take part in the auction, which runs until Aug 1, can visit\n\nbit.ly/sandsforsingapore\n\n.\n\nThe festival itself, an annual charity event, will be held from Aug 1-3.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This will make available an estimated 180 MHz of spectrum.\n\nThe regulations were framed after the conclusion of a public consultation which started in June last year. Taking into account inputs from the industry, these regulations will set out the TVWS equipment requirements, spectrum channels to be made available for TVWS use, and how TVWS equipment should communicate with geo-location databases in order to identify the available spectrum channel to use, among others.\n\nThe geo-location databases will help to ascertain the available channels for use, before services can be broadcast over those channels. Companies interested in developing and managing a geo-location database service in Singapore will be required to apply for a licence.\n\nThrough the licensing framework, the government will be able to ensure that the geo-location database operations comply with the technical parameters and regulatory requirements. Further, to facilitate and encourage the adoption of TVWS technology, the government will waive the licence fees for the first two years.\n\nAn Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) spokesman said the regulations will also provide business certainty to companies which intend to offer services over TVWS.\n\nThis signals Singapore's commitment to support TVWS technology as businesses roll out innovative applications and solutions over TVWS. Interestingly, such applications may include machine-to-machine communications, smart metering and outdoor environment and security monitoring services. All these fall under the gamut of the so-called Internet of Things.\n\nThe spokesman added that consumers will stand to benefit from this additional spectrum.\n\nAs more Internet-capable devices are launched, more spectrum is required for increased data consumption. However, consumer products will be available only at a later stage when the necessary chipsets become available for inclusion into devices.\n\nBusinesses that wish to deploy or use TVWS technology may do so without applying for a licence from the IDA, subject to technical parameters and regulations for the use of TVWS. Consumers may benefit from new services provided over TVWS by various service providers.\n\nIDA's Leong Keng Thai noted that the TVWS regulatory framework is a step towards Singapore's vision on being the world's first \"Smart Nation\".\n\n\"Regulators all over the world are exploring different ways to efficiently use spectrum, so that they can plan for their countries' future needs.\n\n\"The additional spectrum made available through the TVWS regulatory framework will ensure that Singapore efficiently allocates and uses this available bandwidth to support the growing demand for data communication,\" said Mr Leong, who is IDA's deputy chief executive and director-general (telecoms and post).\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The show will be done entirely in Tamil but with English surtitles. The first 40 minutes is a condensed version of the original Akka, followed by the new material in the next 90 minutes.\n\n\"This sequel will talk about how things haven't really changed,\" says Mr Selva. \"For example, they are not allowed to hold certain jobs. They can't be phone operators because their voices are too rough, and they aren't allowed to work in certain shops because of the brand's public image.\" Even in his own experience, he has noticed how many of his transgender friends and acquaintances hold relatively low-paying shift jobs despite having a good education.\n\n\"These people have commitments like children, husbands, and families to take care of too. And it's not that they lie around and not want to do anything,\" he points out. Which is why many of them end up as sex workers against their will. \"Everybody thinks transsexuals go into their trade as sex workers because they want to, but actually they have no choice. Who would want people to come to them with weird fetishes, and harrass them, and make them do things they don't want to?\" he says.\n\nOf course, as the show's director, Mr Selva acknowledges that the play might end up coming across as rather aggressive in getting his message across, but that's exactly what he's going for. \"These transsexuals in the play are not actors, they are real people, just being themselves. Because it is their reality we want to depict, we want them to tell the story. Anybody else telling their story would be fake.\" he explains.\n\nHe says he was compelled to write Akka after hearing the stories of his own transgender friends, who told him their experiences of having people throw stones or packets of water at them just for the fun of it.\n\n\"I want audiences to feel the pain of these people. It won't be melodramatic and make them cry, but it should make them think. That's what theatre is for, right?\" he adds.\n\nAkka: The End runs from July 3 to 5 at 8pm at the School of the Arts (SOTA) Drama Centre. Standard tickets cost $31.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 13, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWHAT do you do when a herd of wild animals decides to charge at you? If your first instinct is to run, don't. Do you think you can outrun a lion, an elephant or a buffalo?\n\nSafari guide Peter Allison says \"whatever you do, don't run\". That is also the title of his first book, which he wrote in 2008, based on his experiences in the safari. \"You have to stand your ground,\" says Mr Allison, who has trained himself not to run. He advises to \"make yourself look bigger by putting your arms out, show confidence, step forward, and in some cases, roar back at the lion. Of course, it helps to practise all these in your head\".\n\nHe bursts into laughter when he reveals that instead of roaring, he finds himself turning into a panicky mess. \"And when the lion sees what a pathetic prey I am, he is no longer interested.\"\n\nFor the record, he has been chased by buffalos three times. \"The trick is to stand your ground and only jump out of their way at the last minute,\" he says, and often he finds himself jumping into a thorn bush. \"Buffalos have taught me that while you can jump into a thorn bush, you cannot jump out of one,\" says the Australian-born guide, who then has to cut himself free of thorns to get out.\n\nAnother time, he found himself in between two herds of lions that were about to attack each other. \"Three males came running in my direction, but I was invisible to them. They were so focused on attacking the other, that even if I had been naked and waving a pink towel, they would not have noticed me,\" he says as he recalls his memorable moments in the safari. \"These lions run at over 60km per hour, and their fight was the most powerful thing I had ever seen.\"\n\nThe charismatic guide, who grew up in Sydney, first headed to Africa in 1994, when he was 19. The plan was to spend a year there before returning home, possibly to study law. On his choice of location, the animal lover says \"it was a toss-up between Africa or South America\". A toss of a coin determined the destination. After six months of backpacking, he was offered a job running the bar of a safari lodge in South Africa, and soon after that became a guide.\n\nThat one year in Africa has since turned into almost two decades. Mr Allison now works with Wilderness Safaris, widely acclaimed as the continent's foremost eco-tourism operator.\n\nFor him, not knowing what each day will be like, is what has been keeping him in the bush. \"I don't need the unexpected on a daily basis, but I like the opportunity that it presents.\" He explains that city living is predictable, and most people would know what to expect from Mondays to Fridays. \"But in Africa, you never know when something extraordinary could happen,\" he says. \"Put simply, I don't want to sleepwalk through my life.\"\n\nHaving lived in countries such as Botswana, Namibia and now South Africa, and having seen countless animals, Mr Allison says he is still struck by the wildlife there. \"There is nowhere in the world like Africa, when it comes to wildlife, and I have checked that,\" he quips.\n\nElephants are his favourite, as \"they are very intelligent, and lead emotionally rich lives\".\n\nAmong the big cats, he has a soft spot for cheetahs, \"they are fast but vulnerable, and are often bullied by the other cats\", he says.\n\nHe adds: \"What happens in the animal kingdom is much like what happens in the boardroom or in real life.\"\n\nHe explains that cheetahs are runners, but when the lions, which are physically stronger, come along, the cheetahs would flee. \"Just like how a local drink company may decide not to run its business any more, when a bigger and stronger competitor comes along,\" he says. \"Often, I've clients saying that just watching the animals hunt in the wild, is much like what happens in their office, but this time, with spotted animals.\"\n\nMost of Wilderness Safaris' clients are from the United States, but he hopes to attract more nationalities to the beauty of a safari. \"Not only do they get to see the wildlife, but they begin to understand more about conservation, and help bring the message back home,\" he says.\n\nThere are still misconceptions about safaris, one of which is how people think that Africa is unsafe. \"Africa has 54 countries. Often we hear only the bad stuff, but there are countries that are safe,\" he says.\n\nAnother misconception is that travellers don't realise the level of comfort they can have on a safari. Wilderness Safaris has over 70 properties in nine countries. \"You get the traditional lodge to the most luxurious lodges,\" says Mr Allison. In between the fine dining meals and enjoying the surrounds of the lodges, safari trips are done about twice a day, and they can range from going around in a Land Rover, going up in a hot-air balloon or paddling in a canoe.\n\nSense of curiosity\n\nSince his first book in 2008, Mr Allison has written two more: Don't Look Behind You, which has more stories of his life in Africa, and How to Walk A Puma, about his misadventures in South America. \"My trip to South America was fuelled by my sense of curiosity, which is stronger than my common sense,\" he says with a laugh.\n\nHe plans to continue living in Africa, to help drive the conservation and eco-tourism message across. On top of drawing in tourists, Wildnerness Safaris also helps the local communities by providing them with jobs, and building schools and clinics.\n\nWith many stories to regale and his chatty nature, Mr Allison would be the ideal candidate as a host for a safari TV programme, but that is not going to happen. He reveals that he rejected an offer from a TV network. \"They are more interested in the host, than in the animals, and that is not something I agree with.\"\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\n@TaySuanChiangBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Given the weak prices of abalone, the company said it is focusing on growing its abalones rather than selling them.\n\nThe company has had three straight years of losses.\n\nShares of Oceanus closed at two cents yesterday, higher by 5.3 per cent, or 0.1 cent, before the announcements were made.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The operator of Singapore's biggest department store was able to rise to the occasion, drumming up record sales of $639 million here.\n\nThat figure was 3.4 per cent or $21 million higher than the $618 million sales the group achieved in the preceding year - no mean feat in Singapore's highly competitive retail landscape. The group's latest turnover figure was more than double its first full-year turnover of $234 million back in 1994.\n\nNet profit, though, fell $2 million or 4.2 per cent to $46 million for the year ended Dec 31, 2013 - due to higher manpower cost and rentals along with a step-up in advertising and promotions expenditure and extensive store renovations as part of the 20th anniversary celebrations.\n\nThe group invested more than $10 million in last year's store refurbishment - its biggest renovation budget following the store's opening in August 1993.\n\nAnd, therein lies a key reason for the retailer's continuing success, despite the onslaught of competition from new malls, specialty stores and online shopping.\n\nTakashimaya Singapore's managing director Yoko Yasuda says that regular refurbishment is vital in helping the group create a \"fresh and dynamic shopping environment to keep our customers excited\".\n\nTo determine just what needs to be revamped and the scale of works, the group keeps its ears close to the ground.\n\n\"We are constantly listening to our customers, and have a keen understanding of their needs and wants. We're always innovating, trying to stay half a step ahead of consumer lifestyles,\" says Ms Yasuda in a recent interview with The Business Times.\n\nAnother important factor that has enabled the group to create a unique shopping experience is its large store area - at 370,000 sq ft, spanning six levels at Ngee Ann City in the key Orchard Road shopping belt.\n\nThis affords the group space to display a wide array of merchandise from competing brands in each category, be it handbags, shoes or menswear. \"This makes it easy for our customers to browse, walk around, compare the price and merchandise,\" Ms Yasuda explains.\n\nTakashimaya's substantial store size has also enabled it to replicate the Japanese concept of \"depachika\" or department store basement floor for a foodstuff market area.\n\nTakashimaya's Basement 2 houses a food hall. Food is one of the top three contributors to store sales, along with branded boutiques and ladies' accessories.\n\nWith a wide variety of goods under one roof, there is something for everyone in the family - from grandparents, to parents, to children. This one-stop shopping destination formula has enabled Takashimaya to withstand the proliferation of specialty fashion stores in the past two decades targeting primarily young customers.\n\nTakashimaya's top management also highlights how the the group has benefited from Singapore's success as a magnet for tourists, with attractions such as the integrated resorts/casinos and Gardens by the Bay.\n\n\"We've enjoyed the spillover effect and have gained a reputation as a premium 'must-stop' for tourists,\" said Ms Yasuda.\n\nTourist shopping at the store has been on the rise. Last year, it accounted for 23 per cent of store sales, up from 22 per cent in 2012 and 21 per cent in 2011.\n\nWhile Indonesians, Chinese and Malaysians remained the top three nationalities of tourists at the store last year, Cambodians made it to the top five list for the first time. Filipino shoppers were in fourth position last year.\n\nDespite its success, Takashimaya has faced its share of challenges operating in the Singapore market.\n\nThe most difficult period was when it first opened in 1993, as the group was introducing unique Japanese concepts to Singapore consumers - such as an art gallery, a local designers' corner and even a cultural centre where cooking and art appreciation classes were held.\n\nPatronisation rates were low and Takashimaya later ceased these services. Looking back, Masahiro Yoshino, deputy general manager and a member of Takashimaya Singapore's senior management team from Day One, reckons the group was a little ahead of its time here.\n\nIronically, he adds, Singaporeans are now more sophisticated and looking for such soft offerings. Rentals today, however, are too high for the group to consider reintroducing such services, since they do not actually make money.\n\nThe group took to gradually introducing brands, products and new unique concepts closer to the tastes and needs of local customers.\n\nDanny Yeo, managing director of Knight Frank, which was instrumental in bringing Takashimaya to Singapore, says of the retailer's success over the years: \"They have learnt and become more bold and aggressive in revamping the store, though this costs money. . . They have been very consistent in refreshing the store.

Its other partner in the project is Malaysia's national utility, Tenaga Nasional.\n\nDuSable, co-founded by Frank White, Jr - a top individual fund raiser for Mr Obama, according to reports - and another of the president's backers, Shomik Dutta, describes itself as a private equity firm which \"blends a unique understanding of government and regulatory dynamics\" in the renewable energy and infrastructure investments.\n\n\"It's an in-country project so why would 1MDB need a foreign firm like DuSable to advise Tenaga, Malaysia's national utility, to navigate the power industry in its own country?\" asked an observer.\n\nRecently, in mid-April, Tenaga said that it signed a power purchase pact that will last for 25 years with 1MDB for Malaysia's biggest solar power project. It is understood that the plant will be built on a 300 acre site in Kuala Ketil in Malaysia's northern state, Kedah. If things work according to plan, it will start commercial operations in October 2016, said a source. If the pilot project is viable, then more such plants that power up to 500 MW will be built.\n\nBT contacted 1MDB and DuSable for comments but none were forthcoming.\n\nThe mega solar project was awarded to 1MDB - not too long after the state-owned fund snagged another sizeable RM11 billion 2,000 MW coal-fired power plant project - on a direct negotiated basis.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And just to make them seem more premium, they're often called Alaskan king crabs,\" observes Kevin Gantner of three-month-old online seafood retailer, The Alaska Guys. \"But if you look carefully at the label of their packaging, you realise some actually come from Chile or Norway. Or they're about half the size of what they should be, and are probably not even king crabs.\"\n\nHe should know. The American petrochemicals trader grew up in Dutch Harbour, Alaska, and spent many summer holidays working on the large fishing boats that drive the industry there.\n\nAfter moving to Singapore for work a decade ago, he craved his Alaskan catch so much that he started getting regular seafood imports sent to him by close friend Dean DeCuir, who he met onboard the boats in his youth. Mr DeCuir still lives in Dutch Harbour and runs several businesses there.\n\nMr Gantner would initially use the seafood at private dinner parties among friends, but word spread and he was soon ordering close to 125kg of crabs every three months for friends and associates.\n\nThough the men had talked of starting a seafood import business as early as four years ago, \"this was the lightbulb moment when we realised we had to make this happen\", says Mr Gantner. \"There's a lot of wealth in Singapore, people are getting more health-conscious and savvy about their food, and are willing to pay for a good product.\"\n\nThe two men incorporated the business in March and their website went live a month ago, followed by a Facebook page two weeks later.\n\nTheir feature product is the Alaskan king crab which they have ready stocks that can be delivered within 48 hours of ordering. Crabs are graded according to their species and size, that is, the number of crab legs per pound. Prices start at $62 per kg for golden king crabs with a 20/24 grade and go up to $120 per kg for premium red king crabs with a 6/9 rating.\n\nBesides the crabs, Mr Gantner also brings in other Alaskan products such as salmon ($21 to $42 per kg), halibut and black cod (both $35 to $42 per kg). As demand is still low in the initial days of the business, non-crab seafood are only air-flown in from Alaska when an order is placed, which means a waiting time of about a week.\n\nOnly frozen seafood is available for now, though products are cryogenically frozen immediately after they are caught, which helps to retain their freshness even better than if they were shipped over fresh from the US, says Mr Gantner. Dealing with frozen parts also means that the crabs will be available all year round, rather than seasonally.\n\nOnce demand picks up, The Alaska Guys will eventually ship in fresh crabs by tapping on Mr DeCuir's close links to the fishing community to directly source this season's catch. They can only source fresh seafood now for orders larger than 100kg.\n\nNot sure how best to store or cook your premium seafood? Customers can contact Mr Gantner directly for buying, storing and thawing tips, and recipes will regularly be put up on The Alaska Guys' website and Facebook page, along with nutritional information on the benefits of Omega 3 fats and eating wild caught seafood.\n\nThe duo plan to open a retail shop eventually, as well as supply to local seafood restaurants. \"Once you taste the difference between real Alaska king crabs and others on the market, you will not want to go back,\" he says.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Helmi Yusof\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 13, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nPICASSO'S paintings hang proudly on many a splendid wall around the world. But the roots of his inspiration began in Spain, where he was born. At the age of 14, he visited the legendary Prado Museum in Madrid and saw the canvases of Spanish masters such as El Greco, Velazquez and Goya. The prodigy, who could by then draw remarkably realistic figures, was deeply inspired by the brilliance of their paintings.\n\nEven when he moved to Paris and started the Cubist movement, the seeds of his artistic vision can be found in works in Prado Museum. For in Prado, the walls shimmer with treasures not just by Spain's old masters but also Titian, Veronese, Rubens and Poussin - all of whose influences can be detected in Picasso's paintings.\n\nParis, London and New York may be regarded as epicentres of the modern art world. But Spain and its cities are no slouches in the artistic and architectural departments. With its wide acceptance of mavericks and iconoclasts, Spain has encouraged the flowering of many unusual artistic geniuses such as Gaudi (art and architecture), Dali (art), Lorca (theatre), Bunuel (cinema) and Almodovar (cinema).\n\nAfter the death of the brutal dictator Franco in 1975, Spain aggressively started to strengthen its place on the global art map. Museums were refurbished, the gallery scene revived and public sculptures and buildings commissioned.\n\nToday, several Spanish cities including Barcelona, Madrid and Seville lay claim to a fantastic cultural landscape that would satisfy any art and architecture junkie. We highlight just a few locations on a recent whirlwind tour across Spain, and we've also classified them according to tastes.\n\nMADRID\n\nFor lovers of classical art\n\nThere are many museums of classical art, but there's something about the Prado Museum that draws out the dark side of you. Maybe it is the Black Paintings of Goya that were executed when the maestro had lost his mind. Maybe it's the strange mirror game in Velazquez's famous work Las Meninas. Or maybe, it's the walls and walls of paintings executed in enigmatic chiaroscuro style (bright-lit centre, dark shadowy surroundings) that render your vision of world just slightly sinister.\n\nBut the Prado will have an effect on you in a way that Paris' Louvre, Florence's Uffizi or New York's Metropolitan never can.\n\nWalk into its large halls and you'll be greeted by some of the finest masterpieces dating back to the 14th and 15th century. Among them is Hieronymus Bosch's classic The Garden of Earthly Delights. Within its 220cm by 390cm frame, Bosch tells a richly detailed story about the origins of sin and fate of sinners, who were first seen frolicking in Paradise and later suffering in Hell.\n\nIt is ominous indeed, but that still won't prepare you for the room dedicated to Goya's Black Paintings, some of the most disturbing classical paintings ever made. The artist had suffered two serious illnesses that left him near-deaf, embittered and anxious of his mortality. They led to the creation of 14 paintings that are remarkable in their hallucinatory strangeness and savagery.\n\nIf, however, you prefer the less sombre side of things, look for other famous artworks such as The Baptism of Christ by El Greco, The Birth of the Virgin by Zurbaran and The Triumph of Bacchus by Velazquez - all produced during Spain's Golden Age (14th-16th century). They may be among the finest classical works you've ever seen.\n\nThe profound art experience doesn't end with the Prado Museum which, incidentally is just five years shy of being 200.\n\nWithin walking distance are two other must-visit museums, Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum and Reina Sofia Museum. The former takes you through seven centuries of paintings with works by Caravaggio, Rubens, Gauguin, Van Gogh, Hopper and other masters. The latter, on the other hand, focuses only on art from the 20th century on. In fact, the Reina Sofia Museum is regarded by art connoisseurs as the best contemporary museum in the world - even better than New York's Guggenheim or London's Tate Modern.\n\nThe hype certainly holds up to a large degree: Reina Sofia has countless excellent works by Leger, Dali and Miro and their ilk. But the crowning jewel of its collection is Picasso's arguably most famous work, Guernica, a massive 7.8m by 3.5m painting that depicts the horrors of war. Inspired by the German bombing of the Basque of Guernica in 1937, it depicts humans and animals in wretched poses as violence and chaos reigns.\n\nThe fact that almost every visitor - including young children - seems awestruck upon their first encounter with this monumental artwork is testimony of its power. If there was one reason to visit Reina Sofia Museum, Guernica would be it.\n\nSEVILLE\n\nFor lovers of classical architecture\n\nNo one ever regrets coming to Seville, the sun-drenched home to some of the most splendid architecture in Spain. The main attraction is the Royal Alcazar, a sumptuous centuries-old palace complex first designed by the Muslims and then taken over by the Christians. Each ruler expanded on the complex so it now occupies 14,000 square metres with 17 hectares of gardens.\n\nExquisite Arabic tilework, patterns and inscriptions exist side-by-side with Christian architecture. The grand Gothic cathedral, for instance, sits on the site of a former mosque, and features an intricate Muslim courtyard and the tomb of Christopher Columbus. There are minarets and towers to scale, and lush royal gardens to stroll in.\n\nIndeed, you might wish to book a room at the majestic Hotel Alfonso XIII to extend the feeling of being a king.\n\nThe nearby Santa Cruz district, a former Jewish quarter, is one to get lost in. Its labyrinth of whitewashed buildings and narrow streets are lined with quaint cafes and gift shops. You can completely imagine this to be the stage of famous operas such as Carmen, The Barber of Seville, Don Juan and Fidelio, all set in Seville.\n\nAbout an hour's drive away from Seville is Jerez's Royal Andalusian School of Equestrian Art, a training school for horses which showcases its elegant charges all year round. These dressage horses trot, canter and pirouette to dramatic music - and then pull off some pretty daring moves to make your jaw drop.\n\nMostly, though, Seville is a lazy, sensual, sun-baked city to unwind in and make your heart beat a little slower.\n\nBILBAO\n\nFor lovers of avant garde design & art\n\nMuch has been made about Bilbao's dramatic transformation from a grimy, declining industrial city into a hip, gleaming art destination - all thanks to Frank Gehry's architectural masterpiece that is the Guggenheim Bilbao Museum. Seventeen years since the museum opened its doors, the city whose name most visitors couldn't pronounce (it's \"bil-BAH-oo\") is now on the lips of every savvy art lover.\n\nThough Gehry's titanium-clad bombshell is a feast for the eyes, the art collection itself is admittedly smaller and less impressive than what the Guggenheim in New York offers. Some showstoppers here include Jeff Koons' 13m-tall Puppy bursting with a variety of flowers, Richard Serra's eight winding monumental sculptures and Louise Bourgeois' gigantic stainless steel spider Maman (Ama).\n\nGenerally, the permanent collection falls on the side of predictable and doesn't elicit the same sort of wonder and surprise in the visitor that the Guggenheim in New York can. Indeed, the nearby Museo de Bellas Artes, with works by Francis Bacon, el Greco and Mary Cassatt, feels less overhyped and more satisfying.\n\nStill, Bilbao offers several attractions for architectural lovers. Apart from the Gehry's show-stopper, there are new and sleek buildings, spaces and structures designed by starchitects Philippe Starck, Alvaro Siza, Santiago Calatrava, Cesar Pelli and others. With bicycle paths and sidewalk cafes around Bilbao, it may be worth renting a bicycle to see how Gehry's building is transforming the face and fortune of an entire city.\n\nhelmi@sph.com.sg\n\n@HelmiBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And after a long search have decided not to pursue this transaction,\" AirAsia Group chief executive Tony Fernandes told Reuters in an email.\n\nLast month, Tiger Airways Holdings said in a statement that it was reviewing its investment in Tigerair Mandala, given \"uncertain market conditions\".\n\nThe embattled budget carrier recorded a $95.5 million net loss for its fourth quarter ended March, and has had three consecutive years of losses.\n\nAnalysts that The Business Times spoke with said that the shelving of the planned acquisitions is a setback for Tiger Airways. \"Tiger has been acting as guarantor for Mandala for fuel and aircraft leases, so that creates a huge financial contractual liability for Tiger,\" said K Ajith, director of Asia transport research at UOB Kay Hian. \"They have to exit out of that contractual liability and selling Mandala is the easiest way.\"\n\nAnother analyst covering the stock said that it would be important for the company's strategy to cut other units and focus on turning its Singapore business around. \"It's important to cut losses from the other places.\"\n\nHe added that the pullout by AirAsia and Citilink could make it harder for Tiger Airways to sell its 35.8 per cent stake in Mandala, as both airlines are big players with the ability to buy Mandala.\n\nAnother possible airline with the ability to buy Tigerair Mandala is Indonesia's Lion Air, but the analyst said that this was unlikely as Lion Air already had a large number of planes on order.\n\nTiger Airways told BT that it will continue to explore possibilities with regard to its investment in Tigerair Mandala. Of the eight planes that Tiger Airways grounded as part of efforts to right-size its fleet, five were from Tigerair Mandala. The Indonesian carrier now operates just four planes.\n\nEarlier this year, Tiger Airways completed the divestment of a 40 per cent stake in Tigerair Philippines to Cebu Pacific.\n\nTiger Airways shares fell one cent, or 1.9 per cent, to close at 50.5 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He exercised regularly in the belief that exercise would raise the high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) or \"good\" cholesterol, and protect him from heart disease. His low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) or \"bad\" cholesterol was mildly elevated. Hence, he was surprised to learn that he had a severe narrowing of one of his major heart arteries. While this may seem rather unusual, advances in genetic studies are helping us to understand this better.\n\nAlthough 99.5 per cent of humans' DNA sequence in their chromosomes is identical, it is the 0.5 per cent that is not that makes one individual so different from another.\n\nAdvances in genetic studies have enabled physicians to identify heart disorders related to abnormalities in single genes affecting heart muscles (for example, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy), heart rhythms (long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, atrial fibrillation, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), and cholesterol (familial hypercholesterolemia).\n\nHowever, narrowing of the heart arteries, (coronary artery disease or CAD), which accounts for most heart-related deaths, is not a single-gene disorder.\n\nGenetic risk of narrowed arteries\n\nStudies have claimed that 40-60 per cent of susceptibility to CAD is inherited. Data from the Framingham Study and the Interheart studies have shown that a family history of CAD is associated with a 11/2 to more than two times increased risk of CAD.\n\nThe Coronary Artery Disease Genome-Wide Replication and Meta-Analysis (Cardiogram) group and other genomic investigators have identified at least 50 genetic variants associated with an increased risk of CAD, with 50 per cent present in more than 50 per cent and 25 per cent present in more than 75 per cent of the population. Some of these genes may have a detrimental impact on a certain racial group but not on others. The incremental impact on CAD risk of these genetic variants is usually modest.\n\nWhat is interesting is that 35 of the 50 genetic-risk variants increase the risk of CAD by different mechanisms which are independent of traditional risk factors such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes mellitus. The earliest identifiable genetic variant associated with CAD was 9p21 on chromosome 9. About a quarter of the population have one copy of 9p21 in each paired chromosome (chromosomes in our cells come in pairs except for sex chromosomes); in half, it is present in only one of the paired chromosomes. The increased relative risk for CAD was 25 per cent for one copy and 50 per cent for two copies. However, this risk is not seen in blacks. These findings help to explain why a person such as Mr A can develop significant CAD despite having good risk-factor control. It also means that when physicians understand these genetic mechanisms better, new treatment modalities targeted at these genetic pathways can be developed to further reduce the risk of CAD.\n\nABO blood and heart attacks\n\nThe only genetic risk variant identified so far which is associated with increased risk of heart attacks is among those in the ABO blood group. In the Nurses' Health Study on more than 90,000 patients followed up for 20 years, the presence of blood group A or B was each associated with a 10 per cent increased frequency of heart attacks and the risk was increased about 20 per cent for those with both A and B blood groups. Those with A and B blood groups produce a protein that modifies the blood clotting factor, called the von Willebrand Factor (vWF), prolonging its circulation in the blood stream; hence, the level of vWF is about 25 per cent higher in those with blood groups A, B and AB, compared to those with blood group O.\n\nAs the main mechanism of heart attack is the formation of a blood clot obstructing the lumen of the narrowed heart artery, increased levels of blood clotting factor will increase the likelihood of blood clot formation, thereby increasing the likelihood of a heart attack.\n\nCholesterol - genes or diet?\n\nWhile a healthy diet remains an important part of controlling cholesterol levels in our body, one must be cognisant that about three quarters of the production of HDL-C and LDL-C by the liver are determined by the genes in our body.\n\nHence, those like Mr A who have been extremely careful with diet and yet have elevated LDL-C are likely to have genetic variations which result in higher levels of LDL-C. In some, the genetic variation may make the patient less responsive to cholesterol-lowering drugs (statins); hence the LDL-C cannot be significantly lowered even with high-dose statins.\n\nA promising, safe and effective way of lowering LDL-C without statins is being evaluated. LDL-C in the blood binds to LDL-C binding proteins (LDL-C receptors) in the liver and upon this binding process, the LDL-C is removed from the blood circulation and enters the liver to be broken down.\n\nIn 2003, a protein enzyme, PCSK9, was discovered to have the ability to bind to LDL-C receptors, causing the receptor to degrade. Fewer LDL-C receptors means less LDL-C is removed by the liver, leading to increased LDL-C in the blood circulation and hence, increased likelihood of heart attacks.\n\nA beneficial genetic mutation which impaired the PCSK9 function showed a modest 28 per cent reduction in LDL-C, but a significant 88 per cent reduction in the risk of CAD. This has led scientists to develop an antibody which is able to block the action of PCSK9, resulting in significant reduction in LDL-C - even for those who were already on high-dose statins.\n\nIt therefore presents a novel, safe and complementary option for those on statins who are unable to achieve optimal results and is an example of how an understanding of new genetic pathways can lead to new and effective ways of reducing CAD.\n\nLearning from our genes\n\nIf your parents have heart disease, you have AB blood and have elevated \"bad\" LDL cholesterol despite going to extreme lengths to have a healthy diet, from a genetic perspective, you are at higher risk of getting heart disease. While it has been estimated that up to 60 per cent of CAD is attributable to genetic factors, the 50 genetic risk variants that have so far been identified can account for only 20 per cent of the risk at best.\n\nSo there is currently a gap in our knowledge. What is clear is that CAD is a preventable disease. The genetic studies have enabled physicians to discover new pathways that cause CAD independent of traditional risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol. Understanding these genetic pathways and developing novel tools to block the development of CAD should eventually lower the incidence of CAD.\n\nThe sequencing of an individual's genome can be done for less than US$1,000 and in under a week. With the rapidly decreasing price of DNA sequencing, it will not be long before the public will demand the right to have their risk profiles analysed. Physicians have formed professional organisations to train their colleagues, in anticipation of the exciting new developments that await us in the coming decade. It will not be possible to stop the tide of genetically personalised medicine. More importantly, more physicians need to be educated to anticipate the preventive tide of genetic medicine that will gradually diminish the prevalence of CAD.\n\nThis series is brought to you by Heart, Stroke and Cancer Centre.\n\nIt is produced on alternate Saturdays.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished Fri, Jun 13, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT'S not everyday that a major makeover comes with a twin but this is what has happened to the Renault Kangoo. The Kangoo was one of the most popular names in light commercial vehicles when the diminutive first-generation model was launched in 1999. The larger second-generation Kangoo has since been given an extensive refresh and is now not only available in two lengths, and can also be purchased as the Mercedes-Benz Citan.\n\nThis is because Renault assembles the Citan for Merc but there are some differences. Perhaps the most important is that the Kangoo costs less than the Citan, by as much as a five-figure sum.\n\nVisually, the Kangoo is also different. It shows off Renault's latest design language, with its front end getting new almond-shaped headlamps and a bigger and bolder chrome logo set into a flowing black grille for contrast.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By May Yip\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 13, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nAT SOME point between nasal hair trimming becoming a basic grooming routine and boyzillians no longer regarded as acts of masochism, shaving evolved into a borderline obsession among even the least metrosexual of men.\n\nPerhaps a trend sprouting from the Serpico-like beards sported by the likes of Brad Pitt, or the rakish appeal of a perfectly styled moustache, suddenly mowing your mug with an electric shaver just doesn't cut it. In fact, if the recent entry of several male grooming establishments is anything to go by, getting the full hot towel, straight-razor shave from a pro could fast become part of the average guy's grooming routine.\n\n\"More men are discovering the pure luxury of an old-fashioned hot towel shave, delivered via the expert hands and consummate skills of a 'master barber',\" says Keith Power, owner of Jermyn Street - the latest newcomer to the old school barbershop scene.\n\n\"The straight razor is a dangerous weapon in the wrong hands, but its cold steel and sharp edge are also the features that give it a certain 'macho-ness'. Let's face it, the hot towel shave is the modern gentleman's facial.\"\n\nForget about getting your beard trimmed - you get it \"sculpted\", and there are plenty of options for getting a professional shave. In the last two years, no fewer than six barbershops offering a pampering groom have cropped up. Three of them opened in the last two months alone - The Golden Rule in Farrer Park, Premium Barbers Spa at Orchard Gateway and Jermyn Street on Amoy Street. All-male grooming centre We Need A Hero, which was opened over a year ago by Cynthia Chua's Spa Esprit group, sees up to 50 clients a month for shaves, with shaving treatments accounting for 25 per cent of its takings. And one industry player attributes the trend to reigning trends in pop culture.\n\n\"A few years ago, 'designer stubble' and the 5 o'clock shadow were hugely popular,\" observes Jonathan Aeberhard, co-founder of online retailer of system razors,\n\nShaves2U.com\n\n.\n\n\"The recent advent of the clean-cut, suave male image made popular by Jon Hamm and the 'Mad Men' look has incentivised most of us to 'tame the inner ape' and forgo the beard in favour of a smoothly shaven face.\"\n\nHowever, while the clean-shaven look may be in vogue, alongside, ironically, hipster beards and manicured moustaches, one wonders if there's any real point for the average Asian guy to go the extra length for ridding just those few whiskers.\n\n\"I don't think the 'wet-towel shave' services will appeal so much to the local men, mainly because most Asians are not that hairy to begin with,\" says William Tan, founder of men's fashion and grooming blog HisStyleDiary.com.\n\n\"That said, the barbershop idea is not new at all here. I remember my younger days when my father took me to the neighbourhood barbershops for a haircut and they offer wet-shave services as well. I think the barbershop is making a comeback now to claim a niche space for men's grooming from the unisex hair salon we now know of.\"\n\nWhile those endowed with lush bristles would more readily seek out the services of an expert groomer, the professionals nevertheless recommend regular trips to the barber for every guy, regardless of hair growth.\n\n\"An oldie but a goodie, a traditional wet shave makes use of a single blade or straight razor to remove facial hair (instead of the modern multi-blade razor commonly used by most men today) which results in a closer shave,\" explains a spokesman for We Need A Hero. \"Getting your shave professionally done also reduces the incidence of razor burn, ingrown hairs, redness and bumps as using a straight razor ensures your skin isn't unnecessarily aggravated by having multiple blades run over sensitive complexion.\"\n\nEven then, this fixation with follicular growth might just be a passing fad for the GQ-reading aesthete who prioritises style over, say, sheer convenience.\n\n\"The Singapore shaving market is worth about $32 million a year, with the bulk of the market being in system razors,\" says Bernard Emby, co-founder of Shaves2u.com. System razors are razor handles with replaceable razor cartridges.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr Emby and Mr Aeberhard launched their e-commerce business distributing affordable ceramic-coated blades. The company is reminiscent of \"shaving club\" models popular in the US, which delivers fresh blades to subscribers every month at a fraction of the cost of grocery store-bought razors. \"Most people won't have the luxury of time or money to go the barbershop every morning for their shave,\" reasons Mr Aeberhard, whose products are priced from $8 a pop. \"It's just not practical. And of course, you can't take the barbershop with you in your bag.\"\n\nHowever, rather than being just fuss-free, fuzz-removal centres, barbershops these days double as testosterone-charged sanctuaries for frazzled gents. \"We can't speak for the preferences of most men, but we can draw comparisons to manicures - some ladies prefer to paint and treat their own nails in the comfort of their homes, some would like to be pampered at a parlour,\" explains Jerome Chee, marketing manager of The Panic Room, a barbershop and retail outlet in Geylang which started out as a one-man outfit in Far East Plaza. \"It really depends on the individual's mood and inclinations at that certain point of time in grooming.\"\n\nHoping to position itself on the uppermost end of the male pampering spectrum is Jermyn Street, adorned with hand-painted frescos, library wing chairs and iconic mid-century modern furniture pieces to resemble a tony gentlemen's club from the 1930s. It is equipped with a bar that comes with Chesterfield-style seating, coupled with strong colour and painted floors, so a visit to the barber becomes a relaxing indulgence for the genteel urbane male. \"Shaving culture has undoubtedly evolved and, in the ever-changing 24/7 world, people take their cue from the past when it comes to indulgence and me-time,\" explains Mr Power. \"This has led to the resurgence of many so-called 'old fashioned' services of which barbering is the main one for guys.\"\n\nBut for those who miss the point of shelling out upwards of $30 for a shave, at-home manscaping could still be a highly pampering ritual. And a coterie of retailers is providing shaving paraphernalia that go beyond your usual multi-blade cartridges found at supermarket checkout counters. We Need A Hero uses for its wet shaves and retails a full range of products by Geo F Trumper, a firm originating from a historical barbershop in Mayfair, London, which has received Royal Warrants from Queen Victoria and five subsequent monarchs. The Trumper range includes a hard shaving soap formulated from essential oils to leave skin feeling soft, and other shaving creams with evocative names such as \"Spanish Leather\". Purists could also choose to whip up the lather from a shave soap with a badger-bristle brush and minimalist stainless steel bowl by Sori Yanagi, available from Aesop stores.\n\nWith such an overwhelming smorgasbord of hair-removal options, men who gripe about waking up just a few minutes earlier to rid themselves of stubble would suddenly find growing a beard a very attractive option, whether or not Brad's had a shave.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The unemployment rate inched up from 1.8 per cent in December to a revised 2 per cent in March, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).\n\nIn April, MOM had put the preliminary figure of March's jobless rate at 2.1 per cent.\n\nBut in its Labour Market First Quarter 2014 report released yesterday, MOM noted that its final figure for March was still higher than that of December.\n\nIt attributed this to more Singaporeans - particularly the less educated - joining the labour market seeking employment because more jobs with higher wages had opened up, thanks to the tightening of the tap on foreign workers.\n\nThe unemployment rate for residents (Singaporeans and Permanent Residents) crept up from 2.7 per cent in December to 2.9 per cent; for citizens, it rose from 2.8 to 3.0 per cent.\n\nMOM said: \"Despite the increase, unemployment rates were still low, comparable to earlier quarters.\"\n\nThe long-term jobless rate also stayed low at 0.6 per cent in March; residents still looking for work after 25 weeks or more slipped from 13,700 in March last year to 12,900 in March this year.\n\nJob openings outnumbered job seekers, though the seasonally adjusted ratio of job vacancies to jobless persons dipped from 1.43 in December to 1.33 in March.\n\nMOM said that while the seasonally adjusted job openings rose for a third straight quarter, the pace of increase moderated to 3 per cent in March, down from 9.2 per cent in December.\n\nThe 28,300 new jobs that came into the market in the first three months of the year were fewer than the 40,600 in the final quarter of 2013, but MOM put the year-end quarter's figure down to seasonal demand.\n\nIt said that the job number for the first quarter was \"broadly comparable\" to the 28,900 registered a year ago.\n\nThe latest jump in jobs brought total employment to 3,552,200, up 4 per cent year-on-year.\n\nThe bulk of the job gains in the first quarter came from services (24,900), mainly in the community, social and personal services (10,700). This was followed by professional services (3,000).\n\nConstruction employment jumped by 4,700.\n\nThe number of layoffs in manufacturing eased from 1,430 in the December quarter to 820 in the March quarter. Similarly, retrenchment in the construction sector fell from 480 to 400.\n\nLayoffs in services jumped from 1,740 to 1,890 in the same period, but the increase was more than offset by the reductions in manufacturing and construction.\n\nOverall, fewer workers were made redundant in the first quarter of the year - 3,110, against the 2,120 in the final three months of last year.\n\nDespite the tight labour market, job hopping stayed unchanged; the seasonally adjusted average monthly recruitment rate was 2.6 per cent, and the resignation rate, 2 per cent.\n\nAverage total weekly paid hours per employee dipped from 46.2 hours in December to 45.9 hours in March. MOM said that this reflected shorter paid overtime of 3.6 hours, down from 3.8 hours.\n\nSome human resource practitioners read this as a sign that employers are making headway in improving productivity in the face of labour shortage.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is also strong in the early stage critical illness market.\n\nPrudential was a relative latecomer to the Shield market in 2005. In 2008 it enhanced its offering to provide coverage on \"as charged\" basis rather than the traditional structure of inner limits on cover. To date there are around 400,000 PruShield policyholders. Said Prudential chief executive Tomas Urbanec: \"We made the decision over the last few years to increase our coverage . . . Customers have responded. As Singaporeans get older and the cost of hospitalisation increases, it will be a bigger issue and it's one we're happy to play a part in.\"\n\nHealth, he added, is \"number one in terms of bringing new customers to Pru\".\n\nThe firm has found, based on a survey, that many people are bewildered when it comes to healthcare advice and options. It recently launched a helpline called \"PRUhealthcare Assist\" to bridge this gap.\n\n\"Overwhelmingly the number one issue was - I don't know who to talk to or where to get advice. I don't know how to make the best decision that drives the most economic outcome.\"\n\nThe helpline aims to help PruShield customers to help them understand their cover, and obtain other information such as the available doctors, the types of wards and benefits. It also proffers information on specialists and hospitals. Mr Urbanec said feedback to this service has been \"very very positive\".\n\nIn the protection area such as critical illness, the firm is looking into the possibility of allowing policyholders to raise their cover with minimum underwriting. \"The critical illness plan you bought five years ago may not be sufficient for the next five years,\" he said.\n\nAnother growth area is the high net worth business. New business in this segment rose 63 per cent over 2012 and accounted for 13 per cent of new premiums.\n\nThe high net worth business comprises protection products such as term assurance, critical illness and universal life policies. Protection values may range between $2 and 3 million in sums assured.\n\n\"The high net worth business will be a major growth area for us and for Singapore for years to come. There are many who have benefited from the property boom and the overall economic environment. They have become more affluent and need the right level of protection and legacy planning.\"\n\nPrudential has an agency force of about 3,600. Its bancassurance partners include Maybank, UOB and Standard Chartered Bank.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The online site aims to bring restaurant quality ingredients to the masses - at supermarket prices. The Chong brothers are best known for starting discount deals site Beeconomic, which American group buying stalwart Groupon acquired for a reported US$24 million in 2010, just seven months after Beeconomic's launch. Karl became the chief executive officer of Groupon Singapore and Christopher its marketing director, until they both left the company last September.\n\n\"I withdrew into my cave shortly after leaving,\" says Chris, the younger of the brothers. \"Groupon was my baby, and I didn't know what I stood for anymore. I knew I wanted to create something, but there was such immense pressure to replicate the success of Groupon. Every Facebook post, every public communication I made, people jumped on as an indication of our next project.\"\n\nAfter \"writing more than 10 business plans and throwing out almost all of them\", it was a meeting with Julian Lee that dragged him out of the rut. Mr Lee and his sister run Freshable, a seafood import and distribution business that supplies to local seafood restaurants such as the Jumbo Group. The Lees were looking to take their business online, the Chongs are digital natives - it was a natural fit. \"We're like the Brady bunch,\" he laughs of the collaborative venture, which cost $100,000 to set up.\n\nLaunched just last week, GoFresh lists live seafood such as Scottish brown crabs, Maine lobsters and bamboo clams, along with frozen black tiger prawns and wild Chilean king salmon. Meats include fresh and frozen portions of everything from tenderloin cuts to bacon cubes, hams and sausages, with sections for organic, corn-fed and grass-fed meats. Each item has its place of origin listed, along with suggested recipes.\n\nFor the more discerning palate, there's GoFresh Exquisites section that lists more premium offerings such as live Dungeness crabs ($80 per 900g), Pacific oysters ($36 for half dozen) and kurobuta pork belly ($16 for 250g). Customers can also write in to suggest items they would like the site to carry.\n\nItems are delivered via next-day delivery directly from GoFresh's six partner meat and seafood suppliers, but most strikingly, they also come with the GoFresh promise: if customers are not happy with the items they've received, they can have it returned for a full refund, nevermind if they are perishable products.\n\n\"We recognised that it will be hard to convert everyday physical shoppers to our online world,\" Mr Chong explains. \"So we wanted to make it as risk-free an experience as possible because we don't want the 0.01 per cent chance of a bad experience to spoil it for the rest.\" The site primarily focuses on seafood for now, but will include other fresh items such as fruits and vegetables or cheeses eventually.\n\nOn the risk of abuse of their refund policy, especially given that they are dealing with perishable products that are costly to replace, he says: \"We'll give the customer the benefit of the doubt.\"\n\nThough online seafood retail is not a new business model, it is an industry where \"more suppliers now want to access consumers directly, but no one has really cornered the market yet\", says Mr Chong, and GoFresh hopes to stand out by streamlining the experience into a seamless, one-click process for the consumer.\n\nHe says of the website's clean, linear interface and supermarket-esque blue and green logo: \"The iPod wasn't the first mp3 player, but it made the experience of listening to portable music much cooler by being sleek, easy to use, and reliable.\"\n\nBesides GoFresh, the Chong brothers are also angel investors in start-ups in the United States and Asia and will soon launch a second new venture, AirClick, a database for freelance photographers.\n\nContrary as it may seem, selling fish is not quite so different from running a group buying site. Says Chris: \"At Groupon, our motto was to enable local businesses to reach a wider audience, and we're still doing the same now, just in a different industry.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Sales of cars, watches, and jewellery plunged by double-digits in April, dragging down Singapore's retail sales by 9 per cent compared to a year ago. While loan curbs continue to take a bite out of motor vehicle sales, economists say flagging tourist arrivals - particularly those from China - could be tarnishing discretionary spending here.\n\nStripping out sales of motor vehicles - which were down 36.1 per cent from April 2013 - retail sales still experienced a contraction of 1.3 per cent, said the Department of Statistics yesterday. This was in part due to a 16.3 per cent fall in sales of watches and jewellery.\n\nThe data fell far short of economists' expectations; the median estimate of eight forecasts submitted to Bloomberg was for a 3.6 per cent year-on-year decline in retail sales. Excluding motor vehicles, the market was expecting a marginal 0.1 per cent increase in retail sales.\n\nThe continued tumble in motor vehicle sales didn't come as a surprise, since financing measures have prompted buyers to think twice before spending on a car.\n\nBut economists BT spoke to were taken aback by the big hit to watch and jewellery sales; they said the last time the category registered double-digit declines was during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.\n\nSaid UOB economist Francis Tan: \"Watches and jewellery are usually quite resilient, and we didn't impose any new taxes - so it's quite strange. I think it might have to do with weakness in visitor arrivals.\" While inbound tourism data for April has not yet been released, economists like Mr Tan and CIMB's Song Seng Wun highlighted March's soft performance, where visitor arrivals contracted by 5.2 per cent year-on-year.\n\n\"Arrivals from China contracted 19.5 per cent in March, and the Chinese spend a lot on watches and jewellery,\" said Mr Tan. He cited Singapore Tourism Board figures, which show that 33 per cent of Chinese tourists' expenditure here goes to watches, clocks, and genuine jewellery.\n\nNoting that many visitors from China come to Singapore on tour packages which include Malaysia and Thailand, CIMB's Mr Song said: \"A spillover effect from the MH370 incident and Thailand's unrest could have affected arrivals from China ... And that spillover effect could still extend into May.\"\n\nApart from motor vehicles, and jewellery and watches,other categories which reported lower sales included the recreational goods (-8.8 per cent), and furniture and household equipment (-2.5 per cent) categories.\n\nBut there were some silver linings; categories which chalked up stronger growth in sales year-on-year included telecommunications apparatus and computers (6.8 per cent), petrol service stations (4.7 per cent), and medical goods and toiletries (4.1 per cent). Added Barclays economist Leong Wai Ho: \"We saw that department store (3.6 per cent), petrol service stations, and supermarket sales (1.1 per cent) were relatively stable - meaning there was no change in normal spending patterns among residents.\"\n\nMr Leong expects to see some lift in retail spending in May, particularly from consumer electronics, \"as Fifa World Cup fever kicks in\".\n\nCompared to March, the seasonally adjusted retail sales figure decreased 0.7 per cent in April. Excluding motor vehicles, they declined 1.5 per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Not anymore\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 13, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSingapore\n\nVERY little has changed on the pitch of the world's most popular sport since the first World Cup was played in 1930.\n\nBut a lot has changed in how the game is enjoyed. That 1930 final in Uruguay was witnessed by only the people lucky enough to have been there at the stadium.\n\nNow contrast that with what will happen this time in Brazil. The final game next month will have 73,531 spectators in the stadium but - and hold your breath here - the live match will be watched by 3.2 billion people, 46 per cent of the global population.\n\nData storage and cloud computing vendor NetApp did an interesting calculation of the increasingly complex data output and bandwidth usage tied to soccer over the decades.\n\nAs the NetApp graphic accompanying this report shows, NetApp did not even have to go all the way back to 1930 to make its point about how technology has evolved so exponentially.\n\nThey started with the 1998 World Cup in France. Based on French cellphone usage stats, there should have been around 15,200 cellphone-carrying spectators in the stadium during that final. If every one of them sent out just one text message during the match to share their excitement, they would have used up a grand total of 2 megabytes of bandwidth.\n\nToday, we would use much more than that just to open up Facebook on our smartphones.\n\nIn Germany in 2006, spectator bandwidth had shot up to 30 gigabytes, mainly from the addition of MMS and some Web traffic, but this will still pale into insignificance when compared with the 12.6 terabytes of bandwidth that spectators at this year's final match in Brazil are expected to consume.\n\nNetApp has predicted that an incredible amount of streaming video will be made at this World Cup. In the US, 79 per cent of viewers will catch the games live online.\n\nThe 2006 World Cup in Germany produced 125 million video streams. The bandwidth figure this year will be through the roof - and this does not even take into account those who will watch the last few games in 4K, an ultra-high-definition video technology.\n\nAnd for a peek into the future: the 86,250 spectators in the stadium for the finals of the Qatar World Cup in 2022 will be sharing the highlights of the match with others in high-definition, using wearable technology - smart watches, Google Glass-type of eye gadgets and hat-mounted cameras. They will consume around 1.3 petabytes of bandwidth.\n\nJust to give a sense of proportion: a petabyte is equal to 1,000 terabytes and one terabyte is equal to 1,000 gigabytes.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/cooper-cool", "site_title": "Cooper cool", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nCooper cool\n\nThe new Mini Cooper is still stylish even though it is bigger and more refined. By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 13, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nEVER since BMW introduced the first Mini Cooper more than 12 years ago, each successive generation has grown bigger. So while the size of the third version is not a surprise, its new engine is. The previous Mini Cooper had a 1.6-litre, four-cylinder naturally aspirated petrol engine that produced 120 hp and 155 Nm. But the new Cooper has a 1.5-litre, three-cylinder turbocharged engine with 136 hp and 220 Nm, or an impressive 42 per cent hike in torque (the more powerful Cooper S gets a four-cylinder 2.0 turbo). Not only does it increase to 230 Nm in overboost, but maximum torque is now available from just 1,250 rpm compared with 4,250 rpm for the old four-pot.\n\nThe new three-cylinder unit comes from BMW's Efficient Dynamics engine family, which uses a half-litre cylinder as the building block for the group's modular range of turbocharged three-cylinder, four-cylinder and six-cylinder engines. As a result of the newfound performance, the Mini Cooper is a lot livelier, especially in the mid-range, where the second-generation car used to run out of breath. The engine is still mated to a six-speed automatic gearbox to drive the front wheels.\n\nThere are no steering wheel-mounted shift paddles for manual changes, only the new gear lever which is perfectly positioned with the more intuitive forward-nudge-to-change-down logic.\n\nDespite the oomph factor of the new engine, the single scroll turbo is prone to some lag when the gear lever is slotted into D; S is recommended for delayed upshifts, especially if you have a heavy right foot. Then there is Sport mode, engaged by turning the cleverly positioned ring at the base of the gear lever (Normal and Green modes are the other two options). What this does is to quicken gear changes, increase throttle response and make the steering less light.\n\nOn the road, the Mini's handling remains confident with a more supple suspension. The ride comfort and cabin noise are improved, so much so that you may mistake it for a shorter BMW.\n\nThe added refinement means the Cooper is still nimble but its handling is not razor sharp as before. But then, it has grown in size - the 3,821 mm-long car is 98 mm longer and 44 mm wider, with a wheelbase extended by 28 mm to 2,495 mm. The cool factor is still high though. Like the other aviation-inspired toggle switches on the centre console, the new illuminated ignition lever looks great. The various knobs and buttons (the power window controls are now on the door) also feel more solid, while the rest of the cabin also manifests this higher level of quality with beautifully contoured leather seats and a new-look fascia.\n\nThe latter now has the speedometer and tachometer directly in front of the driver. The big round display, called the Mini Centre Instrument, is still there in the middle but only for housing the LCD screen (6.5-inch for the Cooper and 8.8-inch for the 2.0-litre Cooper S) and an LED ring that changes colour depending on the function chosen.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/no-surprise-his-moneys-italy", "site_title": "No surprise, his money's on Italy", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nNo surprise, his money's on Italy\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 13, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nFRANCESCO Calvo wears a bemused look when I ask him who he thinks will win the big World Cup game between Italy and England tomorrow morning. The commercial director for Italy's most successful football club, Juventus, takes only a second to confidently declare that the Azzurri (Italy's nickname) will beat the Three Lions in the crucial Group D match.\n\nHis club is, after all, supplying six of Italy's 23 players at the World Cup in Brazil, among them veteran goalkeeper and national captain Gianlugi Buffon, defender Giorgio Chiellini and midfielder Andrea Pirlo.\n\n\"There is a very high expectation back home for Italy to do well this year,\" says the Turin-born businessman, even as he acknowledges the fact that many bookmakers only rate them as seventh-favourites to lift the trophy next month.\n\nMr Calvo, who turns 37 next Wednesday, was in town earlier this week to promote Juventus' upcoming match against a Singapore Selection on Aug 16 at the new National Stadium, the first football game to be played at the 55,000-seater venue.\n\nItaly were last crowned world champions when the tournament was held in Germany eight years ago, and Mr Calvo feels that his countrymen have what it takes to repeat that feat and become the first European team to win the World Cup on South American soil.\n\nBesides the Juventus stars, Mr Calvo also rates striker Mario Balotelli highly. One of the game's most controversial characters, the AC Milan player should get the nod to spearhead the attack against England at the Arena Amazonia in Manuas, ahead of his more inexperienced but in-form colleague Ciro Immobile.\n\n\"Balotelli had an excellent campaign at Euro 2012, and he is someone who can change the destiny of our World Cup,\" says Mr Calvo in an interview with BT Weekend after a lunch event at the Fullerton Hotel. \"As for Immobile, no one knows if he is going to play much in Brazil. We shall see. (Head coach Cesare) Prandelli has many choices, and Immobile would be a good player to bring on in the second-half if we need to score a goal.\"\n\nWhen told that Singapore Pools is currently offering fairly tasty odds of 22-to-1 for Italy to go the distance, Mr Calvo jokes: \"I think I should go and put some money on Italy then!\"\n\nThe World Cup aside, he is busy preparing for Juventus' first pre-season tour of Asia. The Bianconeri (the club's nickname) will first head to Sydney for an exhibition game against an Australian League all-star team on Aug 10 before jetting in to Singapore for the game against the Singapore Selection, which will be led by national team coach Bernd Stange.\n\nThis will be the fifth time that Juventus will have ventured overseas for a tour, following previous visits to the United States (twice), Europe and most recently China in 2012 to play the Italian Super Cup match against Napoli.\n\nMr Calvo describes the decision to come to Asia as an \"obvious\" one for Juventus, given that the continent is the fastest growing in the world economically and hungry for top-quality \"live\" football.\n\nWhile English clubs have been touring the region and cashing in on their popularity here for the last 20 years, he admits that it is not too late for Serie A teams to do likewise. He adds that Juventus, which is supported by one in three Italian football supporters, has a growing fan base in Asia, including Singapore.\n\n\"We have won the Serie A title for the last three seasons, and we want to do something special for our fans in Singapore and give them that rare chance to watch us in the flesh. Most of our players haven't been to Singapore before, so it should be a special occasion for everybody,\" he says.\n\nLast month, Juventus made history by clinching the league championship with a record high 102 points. The club, coached by former Italian international Antonio Conte, won 33 out of 38 games, including all 19 home fixtures, drawing three and losing the other two. Calvo has promised all Singapore fans will get to see the best possible squad turn up at the National Stadium, including the likes of Buffon, Pirlo, Carlos Tevez, Mauricio Isla and Paul Pogba.\n\n\"The English Premier League is already very popular here, and we see the pubs and restaurants packed on weekends whenever the teams play. Serie A, sadly, is far behind but we need to push. We want to raise the profile of Italian football, and of course we want to make Juventus more appealing too.\"\n\nWhat:\n\nSingapore Selection vs Juventus\n\nWhen:\n\nAug 16, 7.30pm\n\nWhere:\n\nNational Stadium, Singapore Sports Hub\n\nTickets from $30 to $180 are on sale at Sports Hub Tix (\n\nwww.sportshub.com.sg/sportshubtix\n\n), with a 10 per cent discount so long as Italy remain in contention for the Fifa World Cup in Brazil\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The look here is girlish and bold at the same time, in a kaleidoscope of colours dressed up with polka dots and stripes. Apart from stationery, Kate Spade fans can also get their hands on other items such as tumblers, dessert plates and umbrellas.\n\nDiesel by Moroso\n\nFrom The Design Store by Lifestorey, 16 Tai Seng Street, #01-00A\n\nEdgy fashion label Diesel has teamed up with Italian furniture company Moroso to create its furnishing line. The range includes armchairs, sofas, dining sets, and smaller items such as mirrors take inspiration from an informal lifestyle concept. Diesel by Moroso appeals to homeowners with a taste for clean lines with a modern and quirky twist.\n\nBlumarine\n\nFrom Da Vinci Home Collection, 191 Upper Bukit Timah Road\n\nItalian fashion label Blumarine has been described as catering \"to that brand of Italian miss for whom no dress is too small nor any diamond too big\". This extends to its home collection too. The extensive furniture range includes chairs, sofas, tables and beds (photo) in predominantly flower patterns, matched with polka dot prints and unique details as rhinestones, studs and lace. Natural fabrics such as silk, velvet, linen, and cotton combined with innovative materials wrap chairs and sofas into soft and curvy shapes.\n\nRoberto Cavalli\n\nFrom Da Vinci Home Collection, 191 Upper Bukit Timah Road\n\nThink leopard print sofas, or snakes that curl around an armchair, and rich coloured fabrics, and essentially that's what the Roberto Cavalli Home is. The look of the home collection is very much aligned with the fashion label's DNA to mix glamour and sensuality.\n\nThe Italian fashion designer says that when he creates a dress, he wants it to emphasise the femininity of a woman at all times. The same with his designs for the home - he tries to identify the character of the person he is designing for. At the same time, his home collection is about sharing the optimism of his fashion with those who love his creativity.\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nFrom Da Vinci Home Collection, 191 Upper Bukit Timah Road\n\nAt this year's Salone del Mobile, Bottega Veneta unveiled an expanded Home Collection, while introducing innovative colours, textures and materials to enrich the iconic styles of the collection. Some new items include the Sawhorse table which now comes in oak, adding a slightly rustic element to the polished piece.\n\nThe silver flatware is available in a new brunito-coloured finish: rhodium and ruthenium that have been combined to create a dark, antiqued effect over the sterling silver intrecciato-engraved base.\n\nAll pieces in the home collection are designed by its creative director Tomas Maier.\n\nHermes\n\nFrom Hermes, Liat Towers, #01-02A\n\nThe French label's lifestyle collection can be classified into two categories. The first is its Maison range, which is launched annually at the Salone del Mobile in Milan. The collection encompasses furniture, and, as of this year, lighting.\n\nThe second collection, Objets, focuses on its Art of Living items such as porcelain, Saint Louis crystal, decorations for the home, cashmere blankets, and games. Just like in fashion, there are the spring/summer and autumn/winter launches.\n\nMaison Martin Margiela\n\nFrom P5, 5 Purvis Street, #01-02\n\nMartin Margiela, the edgy Paris-based Belgian fashion designer has often been described as avant-garde and experimental and his furniture is no exception.

Or how about a bedhead that is asymmetrical?\n\nRalph Lauren\n\nFrom Proof Living, Ion Orchard, #04-16\n\nJust likes its fashion line, the Ralph Lauren Home look is about clean lines, the relaxed lifestyle, and quiet elegance.\n\nLocal retailer Proof Living will be introducing the Apartment No. One collection at its store from August.

He likened it to a buffet spread before someone with a limited appetite.\n\n\"These activities that cannot be hosted in Singapore are equally valuable activities, and now they can be hosted in Nusajaya Tech Park, so it's like an extension of our industrial activity,\" he said.\n\nAsked if international companies will prefer to locate in Iskandar over Singapore for affordablity reasons, he said: \"There is clearly a trend of companies coming to Iskandar not just to arbitrage labour costs or operating costs, but to develop new supply chains in South-east Asia. Some of the end products are made in Singapore, so if they can get their suppliers who also make high value components to be based close by - whether in Singapore or Iskandar - then it just enhances the attractiveness of the whole value proposition.\"\n\nThe 210-hectare Nusajaya tech park will be developed in phases over nine years, although the start-up phase spanning 28 ha of ready-built facilities and land plots for build-to-suit developments will be completed by 2016.\n\nWhen fully completed, the park is expected to yield nine to 10 million square feet of industrial and office space. It aims to cater to multinational companies and small and medium enterprises in growth industries such as precision engineering, electronics, light and clean manufacturing, and warehousing and logistics.\n\nAlready, the park has received 40 per cent pre-commitment for the ready-built facilities in the start-up phase. Mr Khiatani said a large proportion of them are Singapore-based companies, but German and Japanese firms have also expressed interest in the park. The marketing team is also going to the United States next month to promote the tech park and Iskandar region to investors.\n\nYesterday also saw precision engineering firm Sanwa Group of Companies, logistics and supply chain solutions partner YCH Group and Telekom Malaysia's info-communication technology unit, VADS Berhad, sign expressions of interest in the park.\n\nThe park's freehold facilities are mostly land-based factories, suited for chemical as well as marine and offshore engineering industries, but which tend to be limited in Singapore due to space constraints.\n\nThe park's facilities range from semi-detached units of 13,000 sq ft to detached factories of 42,000 sq ft, with prices averaging RM380 (S$148) per square foot (psf) - a fraction of Singapore's industrial land which transacted for S$320 to S$640 psf in the first quarter of this year. The tenures of plots in Singapore go up to a maximum of 60 years only, and even this was recently slashed.\n\nNusajaya Tech Park is actually Ascendas's first industrial project in Malaysia, a fact that Mr Mustapa acknowledged in his speech with a good-natured: \"Better late than never!\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the first five months of this year, offshore RMB issuance was RMB125 billion, exceeding the total issuance amount last year, said RBS.\n\nUnder the PBOC Nanjing directive, corporates and individuals in the SIP can borrow RMB from banks in Singapore; they can also issue RMB bonds in Singapore.\n\nEquity investment funds in the SIP can conduct direct investment in corporates here, and individuals there can remit RMB between China and Singapore for the settlement of current-account transactions and direct investment in corporates here.\n\nBankers were excited by the latest developments, as they look forward to lending directly to companies in China, the world's second-largest economy.\n\nA DBS Bank spokeswoman said: \"The various cross-border RMB initiatives with the SIP will encourage Suzhou companies to tap the Singapore offshore RMB market.\"\n\nDBS has an SIP branch. \"In addition, the overnight liquidity facility by MAS offers financial institutions a very useful tool in managing RMB funding.\"\n\nGuy Harvey-Samuel, HSBC Singapore's chief executive, said: \"With cross-border financing, banks in Singapore will be allowed to lend directly to companies operating in the Suzhou Industrial Park.\"\n\nJason Ho, OCBC Bank head of asset liability management, said he expects \"to see an increase in RMB activities with some RMB flows that could be diverted from Hong Kong to Singapore with this latest development\".\n\nAndrew Cheong, United Overseas Bank's director of asset and liability management, global markets and investment management, described the overnight RMB liquidity facility as another important step in the development of Singapore as an offshore RMB hub. \"We believe this will encourage more companies to settle their RMB trade financing and remittances out of Singapore,\" he said.\n\nNeeraj Swaroop, chief executive of Standard Chartered Bank Singapore, expressed hope that cross-border RMB financing would expand to Tianjin Eco-City, another township Singapore is involved in.\n\nHe may not have to wait too long.\n\nMs Loh of MAS said: \"We look forward to similar arrangements being put in place in the near future, to allow cross-border RMB transactions between Singapore and Tianjin Eco-City.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's essential to give local artists and creative teams spaces where they can progress their ideas. Facilities like this new hub are the building blocks for Sydney's future creative life,\" she pointed out.\n\nThe building is expected to open in late 2017. - Xinhua\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

By Cheah Ui-Hoon\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 13, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHERE are a few ways for spas to differentiate themselves in a highly competitive market. It could be location or design, and of course the range of exclusive products each uses. The latest trend, though, is all about holistic healing, and several spas are banking on natural ingredients to boost the therapeutic benefits of their treatments.\n\nUltimate Crystal Healing\n\nTime: 90 mins\n\nPrice: $328\n\nWhere: Spa Club at Beach Road\n\n75 Beach Road, Fu Yuen Building #01-00/02-00\n\nTel 6339 9238\n\nOpening hours: Monday through Sunday 11am to 2am\n\nCRYSTALS - and their supposed positive energy - are the gems of choice at Spa Club, adding to the arsenal of organic material that are used for massages such as jade wands and hot stones.\n\nThe spa's crystal healing programme promises a calming and uplifting effect, using the ILA range of products, winner of the Best Organic Product at Asiaspa Awards 2013.\n\nThe 90-minute facial's unique point is its reliance on stones and nourishing plants such as rose which raise the \"vibrational energy\" of the skin. The face scrub has micro-fine garnet in it, for example (for regeneration and stimulating circulation) while the jade face mask has cooling jade elements.\n\nThe highlight is the lengthy facial massage with warmed rose quartz crystals that supposedly relax the muscles and ease up stress lines. Rose quartz crystals have apparently been used for a long time for its anti-ageing qualities besides giving your face a soothing massage.\n\nThe therapist at Spa Club does thoroughly massage the face in an elaborate sequence of strokes and presses on acupressure points - a combination of meridian tapping and Tibetan techniques. This releases tension in the face, and encourages healing with the crystal's energy. Amazingly, even though the massage is intensive, you'll probably still head to noddy land, that's how relaxing it is.\n\nOne needs to dig just a bit deeper into one's pocket for an indulgent facial like this - since it's difficult to measure relaxation and age-defying claims, but if crystals are your thing, at least now you know where to go for some rebalancing R&R for the face and emerge glowing after it.\n\nThe luxuriously outfitted 10,000 square foot spa is a great addition to Beach Road, offering a full suite of top-to-toe services, especially as it operates until 2am daily, and it even offers limousine services to locations in the CBD area.\n\nRaw Fruit Facial\n\nTime: 60 mins\n\nPrice: $98\n\nWhere: Immanuel Beauty\n\nParkroyal Hotel, 181 Kitchener Road, #06-11,\n\nTel 6681 6585\n\nwww.immanuelbeauty.com\n\nOpening hours: 11am-8pm daily\n\nIT sounds wonderful doesn't it, to cut up, crush or blend some fruit, seeds or nuts for an honest-to-goodness home remedy for the skin. Until you actually try to do it and realise that the length of time it takes to prepare the ingredients, and the stress of trying to slather it on your face while not causing a big mess in the bathroom or the bedroom, and the problems with self-application, is just not worth it. And you'd rather just book a facial at a spa with its proper set-up and basically, have someone else do it for you.\n\nAt Immanuel, they have fruit and herbal selections for the face, from the German Sensocell (which feature natural plant ingredients and active minerals) range of products. There are avocado, honey, green tea fruit and vegetable facials with ingredients that are free from chemicals, artificial ingredients or perfumes that could cause harm to the skin. It helps in anti-ageing, especially for those with problem skin conditions.\n\nThe therapist recommended the black sesame seed mask for my condition, as it aids in skin tightening. Sesame seed is rich in oil and minerals, besides being a natural anti-inflammatory agent with healing properties. The oil can even get rid of certain bacteria in the skin, and is soothing to suntanned skin.\n\nBut what got me was the detoxification of the skin, as the oil apparently attracts soluble toxins which can be washed away with hot water and soap.\n\nWhat was enjoyable - even if it's standard service these days - is the shoulder and back massage you get while the mask does its work. In this case, I was in good hands with therapist Vivian Hoong, who's been a beautician since 2003.\n\nEven if Kitchener Road isn't exactly Orchard Road, the contemporary styled spa in Parkroyal Hotel has a hook. What is interesting about Immanuel is its cooperative business model, where it offers experienced beauty and health therapists the unique opportunity to run their own business within a shared space. Owner-therapists leverage on Immanual's systems and management expertise, as well as infrastructure, by renting their own treatment rooms and manage their own employees (if necessary) and customers.\n\n\"This frees the therapist to focus on her services and do what she is best at, to care for her clients. The customer will enjoy lower costs, as the therapist has the liberty to decide on the fee structure, without being constrained by the spa that employs her,\" explains founder and IT specialist Deborah Chiam.\n\nIn theory, one can be assured that one is in good hands, because the therapist is wholly committed and invested in service, being an owner and not just an employee.\n\nGreen Spa by Santaverde (Xingu)\n\nTime: 90 mins\n\nPrice: $160\n\nWhere: Beaute by Kew\n\nBlock 2, #01-47, Everton Park\n\nTel 6534 8255\n\nOpening hours: Monday - Friday, 11am - 8pm, Saturday, 10am - 7pm\n\nTHE chic spa is a welcome addition to Everton Park, because why should a neighbourhood spa be any less inviting than the ones in town? Owner Lily Kew also has a deep interest in diet and nutrition, so the holistic slant comes naturally and permeates the cosy salon. Because of her long experience with running spas, Beaute by Kew's services and products are quite boutique, and some of the exclusive boutique products the salon carries besides the aloe vera-based Santaverde range are Suki and Osea.\n\nSantaverde products are all based on the nourishing organic aloe vera juice, made from plants grown in Spain.\n\nA cleansing aloe vera gel removes make up and grime, cleaning without drying out the skin or harming the natural protective layer. The toner too is rehydrating, with the aloe vera, and the rose ingredient in it revitalizes the skin. Throughout the facial, the different steps are separated by a warm compress of organic geranium essential oil - to calm the skin as well as to dilate the pores for deeper cleansing.\n\nAfter a mild extraction, depending on the condition of your skin, the face massage that follows is again stimulating and relaxing at the same time. The therapist uses a concoction of Santaverde Xingu serum, aloe vera repair gel, classic toner, extra rich beauty elixir and aloe vera cream for the face and neck massage. The Xingu features ingredients from the Brazilian rainforest, chosen for their high anti-oxidant properties.\n\nThe skin is then primed for a mask and eye mask, comprising the Santaverde Xingu high anti-oxidant prevention cream, pure aloe vera gel for lots of hydration, and a beauty elixir.\n\nYour facial is finished with the aloe vera face cream and high anti-oxidant eye cream. As you're lying on the treatment bed in the air-conditioned room in Singapore, try to imagine the aloe vera fields of Finca Verde, the place between Europe and Africa, at the southern-most tip of Spain.\n\nYou might emerge into the the bright tropical sun after the treatment, but for almost two hours, your face would have been nourished by plants grown in sandy soil and under a very soft Andalusian sunshine, buoyed by winds blown in from the Mediterranean sea.\n\nuihoon@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Despite a life that has criss-crossed countries and continents as a diplomat's wife, she still managed to keep up with the stage wherever she went.\n\nAfter three years in Singapore with her Spanish ambassador husband, she will put on her first play on the commercial stage, Women of Asia. Earlier in the year, she had staged another of her plays, The Curious Lives of Shakespeare and Cervantes, at the National Library. The play has been performed in Melbourne, Edinburgh and London to critical acclaim.\n\nShe wrote Women of Asia almost 26 years ago in Bangkok, when she was the artist-in-residence in Chulalongkorn University's Faculty of Arts' Drama Department in the 1980s. She'd left the stage in Broadway, and when an American theatre producer and director friend asked her if she was going back to New York to act, she told him there were no roles for Asian actresses. \"That's when he asked me why I did not write those plays myself,\" she recalls. \"The absence of roles for women and Asian women in theatre was a strong motivation. Also, the desire to express myself through a medium that I knew and, to a certain extent, was able to use.\"\n\nWomen of Asia may be among the first plays she wrote, but tellingly, it continues to be relevant today. \"It's about the problems Asian women face in different situations and trying to analyse the effect of tradition in perpetuating prejudice,\" she explains.\n\nThe play was supposed to have been staged in Thailand after it was written, but was called off when she left for Egypt and rehearsals became impossible. Women in Asia was staged in New York and Melbourne eventually, but it wasn't until 2013 that it finally returned to its place of origin.\n\nAnd now, Singapore - produced by new theatre company GenerAsia. Veterans Koh Chieng Mun and Nora Samosir are in it, along with young actors Kimberley Chan and Nadia Abdul Rahman. A play in six segments, the vignettes portray images of Asian women - how they're perceived and the reality.\n\nThere is an opera heroine. Two interracial marriages. An abused daughter-in-law. A prime minister's wife. Palomera is drawn to dramatic themes, so Japanese housewife in San Francisco and The Dowry are among her favourites. \"But then, the stereotypes in Prisoner of Soy Sauce shows humour in otherwise fraught relationships of interracial marriages,\" she says, not denying that she got inspiration from her own marriage, where even food choices were cause for confrontation.\n\nBut lest the \"feminist\" bell goes off in your head, Palomera hastens to describe Women of Asia as a humanist play. \"You watch this play to examine your attitudes to misery, loneliness, exploitation, sex and to try to think and feel out of the box,\" she says.\n\nStill, it doesn't detract from the play's theme that women's roles as protectors and carriers of tradition everywhere, are also the very roles that bind them inextricably.\n\nMuch has been done for women, but more still needs to be done, says Palomera. And she hopes the play will not be relevant 20 years from now, when things have changed for the better.\n\nWomen of Asia will be performed at LaSalle Flexible Performance Space. from June 19-21, 26-28, at 8pm nightly, and 3pm and 8pm on Saturdays.

Data from market operator Energy Market Company shows that despite strong power demand, wholesale electricity prices have stayed below $150 per megawatt-hour (MWh) on a monthly average basis.\n\nThis is because the start-up of new gas-fired plants have brought the monthly average combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) supply here beyond the 7,000 MW mark - way above peak electricity demand levels here of around 6,500 MW.\n\nAddressing gencos' concern over falling profits, Energy Market Authority chief executive Chee Hong Tat said this month that the oversupply in the electricity market is likely to continue for a couple more years, so the gencos should take a longer-term perspective in assessing their returns on investment. This is the nature of capital-intensive industries with their up-and-down market cycles, he said at the inauguration of PacificLight Power's new 800 MW Jurong Island facility.\n\n\"Still, the fact that electricity pool prices have fallen below fuel costs is unsustainable,\" an industry official lamented.\n\n\"One concern the gencos have is their big gas offtake obligation. While the security of gas supply is important (for Singapore as a whole), this situation poses financial risks for the players,\" he said, in reference to the take-or-pay gas supply deals.\n\nFor historical reasons, most of the gencos established earlier here use predominantly piped natural gas (PNG) from Malaysia or Indonesia as their feedstock. Liquefied natural gas (LNG), more recently available following the start-up of the Singapore LNG terminal, accounts for a smaller percentage of their feedstock.\n\nBut a newer genco like PacificLight Power, for instance, is 100 per cent LNG-fuelled, although it is starting to look at diversifying its feedstock portfolio for supply-security reasons. It is understood to be aiming for an initial 10 per cent of its feedstock to comprise PNG.\n\nAn industry observer said: \"Ideally, it should be around 50:50 for LNG and PNG.\"\n\nIndustry officials said that they expect some reprieve in the relatively high gas feedstock prices only when current PNG supply contracts with neighbouring countries expire around 2022. One said: \"We would expect some (price) competition with renegotiation of the deals starting around 2018 or so.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

What prompted this week's column was an anguished cry from a fellow wine-lover who could not \"resist the temptation\" to open a bottle of Rousseau's 2009 Chambertin and found it \"really good - my remaining bottles are now in danger!\"\n\nChallenging conventional wisdom, I would venture that a wine is ready to drink when you are ready to drink it. But this statement needs to be qualified. The chief concern with the drinkability of a wine concerns the stage of its maturity. You can always drink a wine, however young it is. (The converse is not necessarily true.) It all depends on how you like your wine - fully mature, youthfully mature, or still in callow youth.\n\nWhat my friend (he of the 2009 Chambertin, Rousseau) had done was to succumb to the temptation to drink a known great wine at this young age. It's normal curiosity. Anyway, it was the first of a full case of 12 so it was \"no big deal\".\n\nHe still had another 11 bottles at his time of anguish. A 2009 vintage wine is already five years old, a mere stripling, perhaps, but it should already be starting to show its qualities, even a Rousseau Chambertin. And as he attested, the qualities it showed at this tender age were already mind-blowing.\n\nDrinking a wine in its youth is not a waste but a part of one's wine experience. The lesson and the pleasure it gives when eventually drunk at full maturity are invaluable in learning how wine matures. It provides a practical and personal experience of the way in which a wine matures. And it also makes you wonder (at least it does to me) how do bunches of grapes become transformed into this beautiful liquid? What alchemy, what magic, or what unknown force brought about transformation into this great wine?\n\nI have tasted wines from the fermentation tank through the maturing wine in their oak barrels into the final destination in the exported bottle. You can taste the advancement in development until it is just bottled. What I regret not having done was to take one case of wine, taste one bottle a year, beginning from the seventh year after bottling to the 19th year and record the notes. Not too late to start.\n\nAs for tastes, there are some who like their wines young. There is a point in that. In the first place there is no fear of it being OTH - \"over the hill\". Of course, the full potential of the wine cannot be experienced which some would consider a waste but that is how it is. There is always a niggling fear in the back of the minds of those who prefer to wait for full maturity. The fear of missing the bus - it has happened to me.\n\nWhat is a good strategy? The approximate age when a wine is approaching maturity is not too difficult to remember.\n\nA few months ago I picked out a bottle of Richebourg Grand Cru 1999, Jean Grivot, for dinner thinking that the wine, at nearly 15 years of age, should be already mature or close to it.\n\nTasting Notes: Feb 21, 2014. Dark brownish red, clean sweet Pinot aroma, promising; on the palate very dense and concentrated, but surprisingly very closed still; good fruit ripeness, texture has the solidness and size of a Richebourg. Needs five years or more.\n\nHere is a 15-year-old Grand Cru from a very good year, 1999, and still not ready. Richebourgs are big powerful wines, almost as big as Chateau Latour in Bordeaux. A good mature Richebourg is a wine that almost overwhelms you, and one of my favourite Grands Crus. This bottle, the first to be broached, came from a case of six purchased in 2001, that is, on release from the Domaine. There are still five more, thankfully. The performance of this bottle provides a good idea of how long more is needed for it to reach full maturity.\n\nChambolle Musigny\n\n2005, Domaine JF Mugnier\n\nDrunk June 8, with Chinese steamboat. I had been itching to try this wine. A Village cru, from a great vintage, and from JF Mugnier. I had tasted it in the autumn of 2006 from the barrel in Frederic Mugnier's cellars. Now that it was nine years old I finally plucked up the courage to open a bottle.\n\nAgain I was mistaken. A beautiful, deep ruby-red, with just a tint of brown at the rim. The nose was still quite closed; it had the stamp of a ripe Pinot but was still reticent on first sniff. As it continued to air in the glass it slowly took on more lightness and richness.\n\nBut you had to work at it. On the palate, quite closed, more solid, quite full-bodied, more so than expected for a Chambolle Musigny. At the end of the meal, an hour later, it still had not opened up fully. A very good wine, and notwithstanding the lowly ranking still needs more time, perhaps three to five years.\n\nGevrey-Chambertin\n\n1er cru Lavaux Saint-Jacques 1988, Maison Louis Jadot\n\nJanuary 21, 2014, with Japanese shabu-shabu. Medium-dark brownish red; a soft enveloping bouquet of medium-density Pinot aromas of ripe, sweet berry fruit. A very pleasing entry of ripe Pinot fruit, good density and well-balanced, continuing with a firm mid-palate, and finishing clean and lingering.\n\nVery good to excellent. A lovely drink. At peak now but will hold for a good two to three years. Surprisingly soft and tender for a Gevrey.\n\nTwo reasons for talking about this wine. Firstly, from the notoriously slow-developer of a vintage 1988, this wine had taken all of a quarter of a century to mature, but when it finally came through it was little short of glorious. A very good example of this vintage, which as many will remember was the first of the trilogy of 1988, '89 and '90.\n\nThe more important reason is that it illustrates that the major negociant houses, such as Jadot, Drouhin and Faiveley - these three being the ones I know best - also produce very good wines.\n\nThis puts paid to the oft-repeated assertion (almost a snobbish one) that one should stick to Domaine wines as they are superior to the negociant wines.\n\nFinally, just to drive the point home, and almost as important a reason, is that they are easier to come by and are much less expensive. Good to great Burgundies at reasonable and affordable prices. You could not ask for more.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nLifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}

At 6.6 millimetres thick - or about the equivalent of five credit cards stacked atop one another - it is almost one millimetre thinner than the iPad Air.\n\nThis tablet, which Samsung has anointed as its flagship product, comes in two sizes - an 8.4-inch model and a 10.5-inch one.\n\nBoth have telling weigh-in figures - the 8.4-inch Tab S, at 294 grams, makes the 331g iPad Mini with retina display look a little hefty in comparison. The larger 10.5-inch Tab S weighs 465 g - just a touch lighter than the iPad Air's 469g. Tab S buyers have a choice of two colours - Titanium Bronze and Dazzling White.\n\nWhile the Tab S' price in Singapore has not been announced, its US pricing for the 16-gigabyte (GB) Wi-Fi models put it on the warpath with Apple, too.\n\nThe smaller and larger Tab S tablets are priced at US$399 and US$499 respectively - the same as their equivalent iPad rivals. The Tab S will be available in Singapore and the United States in July.\n\nApple currently leads in the tablet stakes, but has every reason to look over its shoulder. In the first quarter of this year, its share of the tablet market fell from 40.2 per cent to 32.5 per cent year-on-year, based on research firm IDC's estimates.\n\nAt the same time, Samsung closed in, growing its market share from 17.5 per cent to 22.3 per cent. Last year was a particularly good one for the South Korean electronics giant; its tablet sales target of 40 million units was \"easily surpassed\" by year-end, Samsung told The Business Times this week.\n\nThe firm did not reveal its sales target for this year, but said that it was \"hitting close to a double-digit growth rate each year\", and that it expected sales to grow \"even further and faster\" with the Galaxy Tab S.\n\nThe tablet on which Samsung is pinning its hopes has the distinction of being the only active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (Amoled) tablet in its current range.\n\nAmoled displays offer a sharper, brighter viewing experience, and the Tab S features a souped-up version of this technology, dubbed Super Amoled.\n\nThis emphasis on display quality is aimed at what Samsung calls the \"mass premium\" market - consumers who use the tablet for activities that are heavy on the eye, such as surfing the Internet and watching long-form videos, like movies.\n\nThe Tab S also boasts a SideSync function which lets Samsung Galaxy S5 users remotely access their smartphone through the tablet. This means that they can make and receive calls and operate apps on their phone through the Tab S.\n\nSamsung's spirited assault on the tablet market comes at a time of burgeoning demand for these devices. By 2017, the total worldwide sales of tablets will reach 381 million units, Forrester Research reckons. By then, more than one in every eight people on earth will be using a tablet.\n\nEven so, some analysts have their reservations about how far the Tab S will be able to carry Samsung in the tablet realm.\n\nClement Teo, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, said: \"I don't expect that this announcement will convert Apple iPad (or) iPad Air users as they have already invested in that ecosystem. It might make them consider it as an iPad back up, but that's a big 'if'.\"\n\nHe added that the Tab S is more likely to appeal to Android users - and maybe some frustrated Windows users - who want a large screen tablet for watching videos or playing games.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For instance, airlines are being encouraged to take part in the FAST@Changi initiative which includes a range of self-service options such as self-service check-in and bag drop.\n\nNoting that Changi's operating costs have increased over the years, the International Air Transport Association's (Iata) regional vice-president, Conrad Clifford, welcomed the new programme, adding: \"We hope CAG will look at additional ways to reduce airlines' costs at Changi, given CAG's robust financial position. This will also help to grow Changi as an aviation hub.\"\n\nUnder the wide-ranging Gain scheme, CAG will also invest in marketing campaigns aimed at key source markets for inbound tourists and work together with the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) to draw more traffic from these markets. The countries in question include Australia, China, India, Indonesia and Russia.\n\nIn addition, the fund will also give ground handling and security agencies a hand by supporting enhancements aimed at boosting productivity levels, given Singapore's tight labour market.\n\n\"These efforts will strengthen the airport's hub status and anchor Singapore as a major air gateway to and from the region,\" the airport operator said in a release yesterday.\n\nChangi is facing stiff competition from up-and-coming competitors, all seeking a bigger share of the travel pie. In the region, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong and Jakarta are raising capacity to capitalise on the buoyant Asia-Pacific travel market. Additional capacity enables airports to tack on new links, raise frequencies as well as attract more airlines.\n\nFurther afield, the fast-expanding and strategically located Gulf carriers have been drawing away traffic from more traditional air hubs while the Gulf states are beefing up infrastructure with an eye on future growth.\n\nQatar last month unveiled the brand new US$15 billion Hamad International Airport which will eventually be able to handle 50 million passengers per year and offers premium passengers perks such as in-lounge immigration clearance.\n\nAbu Dhabi is working on a new terminal building which will inject some 30 million in passenger handling capacity by 2017. Meanwhile, Dubai International is expected to leapfrog London's Heathrow to become the world's busiest airport by 2015 - and stay there.\n\nAirlines too are finding themselves buffeted by tough operating conditions - shaped by foreign exchange volatility, high fuel prices as well as stiff competition - which is putting downward pressure on yields. Political instability in Thailand as well as weaker outbound travel from China to South-east Asia in the wake of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 have also hurt travel demand. Iata projects that the airline industry will see a net profit margin of 2.4 per cent this year.\n\nFor the period spanning January to April, the number of passengers handled at Changi was up just 1.7 per cent year on year to 17.58 million. In April, Thailand and China traffic fell 15 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively.\n\n\"While we cannot iron out the volatilities of the industry cycle, we believe that Gain will provide helpful temporary cost relief as airlines implement the necessary measures needed to adjust to the evolving market environment,\" said Lee Seow Hiang, CAG's chief executive officer. \"At the same time, we believe the programme provides encouraging opportunities for our partners to collaborate with us to explore new ideas and initiatives that will collectively position us strongly for the next wave of growth.\"\n\nAirlines that BT spoke to yesterday said that the fund appears beneficial for carriers.\n\n\"It's well known that South-east Asia is one of the most competitive aviation markets in the world so any move to reduce costs is a positive one,\" highlighted Bara Pasupathi, chief executive of Jetstar Asia which is collaborating with Changi on a self-service programme.\n\n\"We're certainly interested in (the) announcement as on the surface it seems a positive development,\" a spokesman for budget carrier Scoot told BT. \"We look forward to receiving substantive details in due course.\"\n\nBeyond mid-2015, the incentives and support programmes under Gain will be tweaked in line with traffic patterns at Changi and operating conditions in the regional airline industry.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Wilson Sons' investments are delivering profit growth after the company spent more than US$1 billion from 2007 through late 2013 to add shipyard capacity and port space, he said. \"There is a robust potential for dividend increases,\" Mr Gutterres said on Wednesday. \"It's sustainable.\"\n\nWilson Sons in March agreed to pay US$27 million in dividends after reporting record earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation for 2013. Shares of the firm, which also operates container terminals, shipyards and vessels for the oil and natural gas industry in Brazil, last month reached the highest level since its 2007 listing.\n\nAberdeen holds an 18.8 per cent stake in Wilson Sons, according to data by Bloomberg.

Its resultant focus on flexible packaging led to its change of name.\n\nMr Jong said: \"We don't want to continue doing the same business because it seems to be something investors or the market may not see eye-to-eye with.\"\n\nThe company's board, looking for something sustainable, believed that green technology in the Chinese market could be it, given the government's emphasis on green development.\n\nBecause it had no experience in this area, it appointed two of Harbin Promlite's management team - legal representative Mr Wang and deputy general manager Wu Xueying - as the company's executive directors.\n\nMr Jong said: \"We think it's the right decision and they are the right partner. That's why we've come together.\"\n\nMs Wu said Harbin Promlite can leverage Youyue's status as a listed company. \"The 'Made in Singapore' brand will offer us a competitive advantage as we develop our markets both in mainland China and abroad,\" she said, adding that the company was well-positioned to ride on China's trend of green development.\n\nIncorporated in 2012, Harbin Promlite engages in project-based activities to make environmentally-friendly upgrades to existing infrastructure. Having qualified as a registered energy-conservation service company, it can work with the Chinese authorities on energy conservation projects in the city of Harbin.\n\nWith the installation and management of LED lightings as part of its business, it gains from energy cost savings.\n\nIts other area of expertise is in town planning involving green technology in the upgrading of existing estates.\n\nMs Wu said this is a new way forward in China; Harbin itself has 50 million square metres of old estates - and thus, market potential.\n\nThere are plans for a project in Hebai estate this year benefiting about 1,800 households.

His latest film is stacked with all of the above but it's mostly empty noise, signifying nothing.\n\nWhile there appears to be room in the world for subversive comedies about stuffed toys with frat-boy personalities and sex on the brain (the box-office never lies), a weak spoof set in the Wild, Wild West is another matter. MacFarlane's latest attempt at offensive humour takes its cue from comedy westerns of an earlier era - Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles (1974) is an obvious source of inspiration - but apart from having more stupid fart jokes, the movie doesn't offer the same kind of freshness or comic impact.\n\nBlazing Saddles had a zany, anything-goes attitude and was perhaps guilty of going way over the top in the end. On the other hand, A Million Ways is simply a star having his way with a self-indulgent spoof. The film, directed by MacFarlane and written by him with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild, includes a few famous faces along for the ride - among others, Bill Maher, Christopher Lloyd and Ryan Reynolds show up in cameos - but the main problem with MacFarlane's film is that it just isn't that funny.\n\nMacFarlane has undisputed comic credentials - he's the creator of a popular animated TV show (Family Guy) and was the R-rated voice of Ted in his debut feature-length comedy - but it takes more than actors in cowboy costumes spewing modern-day dialogue to qualify as frontier humour. Albert Stark (MacFarlane) is a timid sheep farmer struggling to make ends meet in the tumbleweed town of Old Stump, a lawless, depressing place in 1882.\n\nHis girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) dumps him for the oily Foy (Neil Patrick Harris), who has the two things that Albert sorely lacks: money and a waxed moustache. Meanwhile, Albert's best buddy Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) seems blissfully unaware that his girlfriend Ruth (Sarah Silverman) is the town's most popular prostitute. But then a new chick in the form of Anna (Charlize Theron) rides into the picture and takes an instant shine to Albert.\n\nThey share a few sunsets and sob stories and she shows him how to handle a six-shooter when Albert rashly challenges Foy to a duel. The only problem is, Anna's husband Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson) is the meanest killer in the territory.\n\nClinch has been away on nasty business but there'll be hell to pay when he finds out that Albert has been getting cosy with his wife. I'll admit that the landscapes were stunning and a couple of jokes involving sheep elicited a chuckle or two, but that's not enough to keep viewers entertained over the course of a two-hour movie.\n\nA Million Ways to Die in the West is a disappointing and disjointed effort from a comic of MacFarlane's reach and stature. Next time around, let's hope it's more than just the filmmakers who are in on the joke.\n\nRating:\n\nC-\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It found that superior performance for conglomerates was not a given across the South-east Asian economies. Premiums enjoyed tend to disappear as the economy developed.\n\nIn the pioneering economies of Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia, Bain found that success for conglomerates came from their participating broadly and being present in the high-growth sectors such as real estate, manufacturing and energy.\n\nBut successful conglomerates require privileged access to opportunities, close ties with governments and stakeholders, scale and a willingness to ride out volatile economies.\n\nIn the study, which classified Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore as emerging economies, conglomerates were facing increasing competition, but those with a more focused portfolio, businesses in leadership positions and budding international exposure enjoyed greater success.\n\nBain also studied the mature economies of Japan, South Korea, the United States and the United Kingdom for comparison, and found that, in these countries where competition was intense and investor activism high, only the best conglomerates survived.\n\nThese had, among other things, a focused portfolio of businesses, regional or global leadership positions, a world-class management team with a mix of foreign and local talent and an active mergers and acquisitions (M&A) strategy, which included regular \"pruning\".\n\nBased on its study, Bain concluded that there were a few truisms; one is that conglomerates' strategies need to evolve as their economies matured.\n\nHowever, while their participation in high- growth sectors was critical in pioneering economies, sector selection emerged as less relevant in mature economies.\n\nAnd while diversification drives returns in pioneering economies, successful conglomerates need to become more focused over time. Malaysia's Genting Group, for example, moved from being a diversified conglomerate to being focused on global hospitality.\n\nLastly, while successful companies are initially local, robust international strategies become critical as economies mature.\n\nBain pointed to how Singapore's Sembcorp, over the years, sold non-core units and reinvested in the international expansion of its core business units, marine engineering and utilities, while developing a third core business in mixed industrial-residential township development. This has resulted in a global footprint with large international revenue share.\n\nNotably, Bain said, irrespective of stage of the economy, leadership was critical to the success of a conglomerate. It suggested that conglomerate leaders needed to invest behind five key themes:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The act landed the King of Cantopop in hot water at his recent show in Macau, when the Chinese press reported a smooch with an over-enthusiastic female fan went a little too far.\n\nBut clearly, none of his Singapore fans was about to complain as the women - and some men - clamoured to be kissed by \"the Hui\". The generous gesture and warmth Hui displayed are probably reasons he remains popular on the live music circuit even though it's been ages since he has recorded any new material.\n\nNow entering the fourth decade of his showbiz career, suffice it to say, he knows how to work the room, though it's no mean feat getting a 5,000-strong crowd - mostly middle-aged and senior citizens, no less - up on their feet. But like a seasoned performer, he did just that even though at times it sounded like he was running out of breath attempting it.\n\nStill, you've got to give it to the 65-year-old for trying and at just under three hours, the show was a tad shorter than the epic four-hour-plus concerts he's been known for. The fans probably didn't feel that short-changed either with the marathon 37-song setlist comprising all his signature hits such as Best Partners, Is That Rain or Tears, Suzy from Tsim Sha Tsui, Genius and Idiot, Modern Security and more.\n\nWhenever Hui needed a breather, he turned the show into a family act by bringing on his sons Scott and Ryan, both of whom have obviously inherited their father's musical genes with their note-perfect covers of his hits. Despite looking trim, age has probably taken a toll on Hui as is evident in his stiff dancing during some of the faster numbers. The man didn't exactly move like Jagger, The Rolling Stones frontman who, believe it or not, is five years his senior at 70.\n\nBut when it comes to giving fans the best concert experience, only Hui is brazen enough to seal the deal with a kiss as the ultimate personal touch.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Revenue was US$379 million, up from US$128 million pre-consolidation.\n\nThe loss came from non-recurring items like one-off acquisition-related transaction fees, higher-than-average fixed costs and the higher cost of goods sold due to an upward revaluation of inventory.\n\nNet profit would have been US$3.8 million without the non-recurring items.\n\nThe bottom line of the combined firm will continue to be weighed down by higher cost of goods sold for the next year, said Joselito D Campos Jr, Del Monte Pacific's managing director and chief executive.\n\n\"Given the timing of the acquisition towards the end of the fiscal year in April 2014, a majority of the revalued inventory will be sold in the financial year ending April 2015, and will continue to impact the bottom line of the group,\" he said.\n\nNew inventory produced in the current financial year will not be subject to revaluation. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) are thus expected to strengthen in the company's 2015 fiscal year.\n\nDel Monte Pacific, dual-listed in Singapore and the Philippines, completed its US$1.7 billion acquisition of the consumer food business of US corporation Del Monte Foods in February.\n\nThe two companies are not related.

Some banks are also still basing their financing on the sales-and-purchase agreement (SPA) price rather than net selling price, a survey by the national House Buyers Association (HBA) has found.\n\nOn a more positive note, except for one small developer, the projects surveyed by HBA volunteers did not offer the easy financing developer interest bearing scheme (Dibs), which the government had banned from this year.\n\nBrochures and other materials gathered by volunteers at various property fairs, however, indicate that many developers - even the bigger ones - are ignoring the guideline on so-called freebies.\n\n\"The guideline effectively bans all freebies from January unless they are converted in monetary terms and buyers given the choice of whether to deduct them from the house price,\" said HBA secretary-general Chang Kim Loong.\n\nSome 20 large and established developers were caught flouting the guidelines as were 10 smaller or newer players. \"If the big boys don't follow the rules, you can't expect the smaller ones to,\" he observed, adding that details of HBA's findings have been conveyed to the Housing Ministry.\n\nPerhaps because Dibs is no longer available as an inducement, the practice of rebates has intensified compared to previous years.\n\nIn some cases, purchasers continue to get away with not putting down any cash upfront. Based on a rebate of a tenth (they typically range from 5-10 per cent) of the SPA price, a buyer only needs to apply for 90 per cent financing from the panel banks. But because legal fees on the sales and loan agreements are thrown in, the buyer can effectively buy a home without an initial down payment.\n\nUsing an established developer which had implemented such a practice as an example, Mr Chang said that its properties in a recent launch were sold at above RM700,000 (S$273,000) when the true value after rebates and freebies is closer to RM600,000. \"Would it not be better to launch at RM600,000 and ask buyers to pay the required down payment of a tenth instead of artificially hiking up the price to RM700,000 and then hood-winking house buyers by giving rebates and freebies?\"\n\nWhile developers - and perhaps homeowners - prefer to see property values rise, new buyers are saddled with higher prices. And more affordable housing becomes a distant dream for many.\n\nDevelopers maintain that prices of new homes will not dip because of a number of factors including the cut in electricity and fuel subsidies, as well as the introduction of a minimum wage, all of which have pushed up costs.\n\nMeanwhile, the HBA also urged banks to stop abetting developers by offering easy loans. Mr Chang said that while the housing ministry has been very cooperative, the HBA would like to see greater enforcement and the \"empowering of information\" via the ministry's website. It should provide a list of errant developers so that house buyers can make more informed choices.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

I was pretty havoc, going to nightclubs and listening to the music of the 1970s like Elton John. I think, compared to me and my peers, the 16-year-olds of today look pretty tame.\"\n\nBut it wasn't just Lee who was going through dramatic changes. So was Singapore: \"There were people here who wanted the country to open up and be more liberal. But at the same time, the government was clamping down on drugs and long hair on men. Singapore, too, was in the throes.\"\n\nTo Lee, hotpants - or really tiny shorts - is emblematic of the era because it generated so much debate.\n\n\"Her World put a model in hotpants on its cover, and that divided the public. I had friends who wore them, and that scandalised some people,\" he says.\n\nHis new cast includes familiar faces such as TV personality Nikki Muller and radio deejay Denise Tan, who had just come off the similarly 1970s-inspired Singapore adaptation of The Rise And Fall of Little Voice. The cast also has not one but two former Singapore Idol stars, Tabitha Nauser and Joakim Gomez. Indeed, more than half of the cast were born after the 1970s.\n\nBut the young actors insist that the thrill and exuberance of the '70s decade, with its funky fashion and groundbreaking music, is something they too celebrate.\n\n\"Everything about the 1970s is outrageous - that's why we still talk about it. The platform shoes, the bell bottoms, the crazy make-up - I love it,\" says Nauser. Tan jokes: \"I already looked like I was in the 1970s during my university days in the 1990s. I only shopped at thrift shops then so I was wearing a lot of bell bottoms and polyester dresses.\"\n\nLee says he wanted to reprise the show because he wasn't entirely satisfied with the 1997 version: \"I had not done so many shows then, and I have learnt so much about theatre musicals since. So I've rewritten the original script to make it tighter, and I've added and taken out songs, so now there are about 15 songs including reprises. Plus, it gives me a chance to direct again - something that I'm not always given a chance to.\"\n\nHotpants is from Aug 14 to 30, 8pm, at Drama Centre Theatre. With 3pm and 2pm matinees.

The critics generally pan his drama-comedies that target a broad audience and the 54-year-old acknowledges he's resigned to that fate during an interview for his latest film, The Lion Men: Ultimate Showdown.\n\nYet almost everything he's done has gone on to become box-office hits and Neo makes absolutely no apologies if a certain group of people do not see eye-to-eye with him when it comes to his movies.\n\n\"If I make a film that gets four or five stars from reviewers but nobody comes to watch it, that's not me,\" he says, during the candid hour-long chat in his office, where he often beams with pride for his body of work. He has every reason to - when not breaking his own box-office records, his movies continue to be profitable and cross the million-dollar mark easily.\n\nThey are also well-received across the Causeway and beyond; Money No Enough 2 (2008), for instance, continues to screen in Taiwan, where it has been playing for 61 months and counting.\n\nIf anything, Neo sees himself more as a guinea pig for the industry because he tries to push the envelope with his films. The liberal use of local dialects in his movies, for instance, is something he pioneered when he made his big screen writing debut with Money No Enough (1998).\n\nThe political jibes and critiques of national issues such as the education system in films that include 2002's I'm Not Stupid (and its 2006 sequel) are also things the veteran entertainer peppers his scripts with to strike a chord with local movie-goers. But he makes one thing clear - \"I'm an artist, I'm not a politician or the opposition.\"\n\nAnd one thing is for sure; he's still the undisputed local box-office champ though the writer-director-actor claims he receives no favouritism from distributors, exhibitors and investors.\n\n\"I face exactly the same problems as a new filmmaker - if anything, Hollywood is controlling things - I still have to look for money, fight for time slots and deal with issues like censorship; I don't get any special treatment,\" says Neo, whose showbiz career has spanned about four decades.\n\nHe's proven to be an astute businessman who knows when to strike when the iron is hot. The crowd-pulling fresh-faced cast he discovered in the first two instalments of Ah Boys To Men (2012/2013) - now Singapore's highest-grossing films, collecting over $14 million at the box office - are back in The Lion Men (2014) and its sequel, which opened yesterday, before reuniting for a third Ah Boys movie next year.\n\nHis impressive track record is probably what helps him pull through the bad reviews and lack of awards. \"We'll need art films to build Singapore's name on the world stage but we must also have commercially successful ones to build and support our own industry,\" says Neo. \"It's a cycle that must exist (together in the eco-system to keep the industry viable.\"\n\nThe Lion Men: Ultimate Showdown is in cinemas now\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

She may be an A-list celebrity but her status allows her to make interesting career choices, away from the Hollywood norm. Under the Skin, a moody contemplation of identity and alienation and inflected with slightly bizarre elements of science fiction, is about as far removed as possible from the land of the summer blockbuster.\n\nThis is no big-budget star vehicle - in fact the scenes are generally so under-lit that at times viewers will have to squint into the gloom on the screen and use their imaginations to figure out what they're looking at. Director Jonathan Glazer evokes a dangerous, grimly uncertain mood by taking a less-is-more approach, and his sparse use of light is matched only by a distinct lack of dialogue.\n\nThe film, adapted by Glazer and Walter Campbell from the novel of the same name by Michel Faber, begins with a dazzling interstellar white light that eventually dissolves into a close-up of Ms Johansson's eye. It then proceeds to tell the story of an unnamed extraterrestrial who inhabits the body of an attractive female and spends her time luring strangers into her van with the promise of a sexual encounter.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's a role that Hong Kong funnyman, Chapman To, took seriously enough to whip himself into shape for this reboot of the similarly titled 2003 adult comedy that starred Louis Khoo (who also has a cameo here) and Cantopop singer Eason Chan.\n\n\"The dieting was the toughest part; for three months, I only ate chicken breast meat, vegetables, egg whites and cut out oil and sugar totally,\" says To, via an e-mail interview. \"On top of that, I had to keep to a strict three-hour exercise regime every day... I used Sylvester Stallone's Rocky character as my role model because he was not afraid of pain to get the body he wanted.\"\n\nOne can hardly blame To for wanting to look his best. The 42-year-old's co-stars include not one but seven real-life Japanese adult video actresses - Anri Okita, Maiko Yuki, Kana Yume, Nozomi Aso, Tsukasa Aoi and Yui Tatsum. \"I was a little shy at first, of course, but after seeing how professional they were (even when acting with their clothes off), their courage rubbed off on me,\" adds the comedian, who shared many topless scenes with them.\n\nThe raunchy comedy premiered at the Hong Kong International Film Festival in March before becoming one of the highest-grossing films in Hong Kong this year, collecting HK$18 million (S$3.6 million) at the box office and raking in another US$330,000 during its recent Australian and New Zealand run. Singapore is the first Asean country that 3D Naked Ambition is opening in.\n\nWhile To lost weight for his role, his co-star Josie Ho - daughter of Macau casino magnate Stanley Ho - on the contrary gained extra pounds to play a jilted lover. That gave her a chance to taunt the actor whenever the cast was having lunch on the set as she showed off her meal to him.\n\nA comedienne by nature, Ho always had a comback ready. \"Chapman would take a photo of what I was eating and tell me just looking at the picture was enough to make him feel full. But you know what, I'll then make him give up his lunch box to me!\" recalls Ho.\n\nShe jokes that being surrounded by her semi-naked female Japanese adult video co-stars was the only thing that made her slightly awkward because she was the only actress who remained fully clothed on the set. But like To, she praised everybody, including the male cast and crew, for their professionalism during the shoot.\n\n\"The guys were always very serious when the camera was rolling - they made it a point to keep their Game Faces on - but the moment we're not shooting, they'll start surrounding the girls like the real fan boys they actually are as they ask for autographs and photographs!\" she laughs.\n\n3D Naked Ambition (also in 2D format) is in cinemas now\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Ascott will manage the serviced residence for the first two years before transitioning to a franchise arrangement.\n\nThe franchise for Citadines Kuta Beach Bali was awarded to PT Menara Permata Propertindo. Ascott is also working with the same company for Somerset Kencana Jakarta, which Ascott will be managing when the property opens next year.\n\nAscott's chief executive officer, Lee Chee Koon, hailed the franchise agreements as a \"new milestone for Ascott\", adding that franchising will become one of Ascott's growth drivers in the future.\n\n\"It will allow us to build our scale rapidly in our existing markets and expand into new markets,\" he said. \"Together with investments, management contracts and strategic alliances, franchise will bring us closer to achieving our target of 40,000 apartment units globally by 2015.\"\n\nThese pacts increase Ascott's presence to 85 cities worldwide in 24 countries under its serviced residence brands - Ascott, Citadines and Somerset.\n\nAscott is already the largest international serviced residence owner-operator in Indonesia with over 2,400 apartment units across 11 properties in Jakarta, Surabaya and Bali.\n\nIts move to introduce the Somerset brand to Laos is prompted by the positive developments there, where economic reforms are drawing more foreign direct investments, expatriates and corporate travellers.\n\n\"This will generate significant demand for our serviced residence especially since there is a lack of international-class serviced residences in Vientiane,\" Mr Lee said.\n\nIn April, LCD shareholders received a buyout offer of 17 cents a share by brothers Raymond and David Lum, who collectively control about 32 per cent of LCD shares through their own holdings and concert parties.\n\nMr David Lum is the senior executive director of LCD and managing director of SGX-listed Lum Chang Holdings. Mr Raymond Lum is the executive chairman of Lum Chang.\n\nBut the offer price of 17 cents a share, in light of LCD's net asset value of 27 cents per share, has irked LCD minority shareholders. The offer has been extended to June 23, after receiving valid acceptances amounting to 3.67 per cent of the issued share capital of LCD as at Monday. Shares of LCD were unchanged yesterday at 26.5 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Those with elite status - from premier silver to premier 1K - will get anywhere from seven to 11 points per dollar spent. The chart for how many points are needed to redeem free flights remains unchanged.\n\nAs part of the announcement earlier this week, the company has added a few new redemption choices so that consumers can use points towards, for instance, upgrading to Economy Plus seats that offer more legroom.\n\n\"These changes are designed to more directly recognise the value of our members when they fly United,\" Thomas O'Toole, United's senior vice-president of marketing and loyalty and president of MileagePlus, said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe trouble is that for those who shop for a great bargain price for a trip to Tokyo from, let's say, Washington, you'll be rewarded as much as someone who massively overpaid for a last-minute flight to Los Angeles.\n\nUnited seems to be following its competitor Delta Air Lines, which made almost the same change to its SkyMiles programme earlier this year. Smaller carriers, including JetBlue and Southwest, already have programmes that calculate points based on dollars spent rather than miles. The news from United means that among the three biggest US carriers - United, Delta and American Airlines - only American has not made the change.\n\nIt's not obvious that it will follow suit, says Brian Kelly, founder of the website ThePointsGuy.com and self-described \"frequent flier mile and credit card point ninja\" on Twitter.\n\n\"I think American might use this as a differentiator: 'We value customers, not just those who pay full-fare and first-class,'\" said Mr Kelly, who notes that American Airlines introduced the first frequent-flier programme.\n\nBut he said that it's only a matter of time before airlines begin making it much harder for customers to redeem reward tickets by raising the number of points needed. One easy way is to make redemption requirements based on the cost of the ticket as well, so that suddenly a US$12,000 first-class flight to Asia requires many more points than it used to simply because the full fare is extraordinarily expensive.\n\nSo what should consumers do?\n\nMr Kelly says MileagePlus users who are unhappy about the changes could call American Airlines for what's called a \"status match\", where a member with elite privileges through United's programme can transfer that status to American. Another option is to rely more on credit cards to accrue points, especially those that make it easy to transfer points to multiple airlines.

If that's the case, he might prefer artworks that are more abstract than representational. Filip Gudovic, a promising young abstract artist newly graduated from Lasalle College of the Arts, is showing several works at iPreciation Gallery on Cuscaden Road, and one artwork at Equator Art Projects in Gillman Barracks. As a newcomer, his prices are still low, between $2,800 and $3,200, while his canvases - such as this 210 x 160cm work titled Design of an Italian Restaurant - are large enough to peer deep into and get lost in. Incidentally, he comes highly recommended by his teacher, Cultural Medallion recipient Milenko Prvacki, whose works are showing alongside his at iPreciation.\n\nFor the hipster dad\n\nIf your dad is a bit of a rock-and-roller, you might want to check out the cool, psychedelic, street graffiti-inspired artworks of Wedhar Riyadi. Riyadi is an up-and-coming Indonesian artist who has been selected for prestigious shows such as the Asia Pacific Triennial and the Indonesian Eye. Fusing a riot of hallucinogenic colours with street art symbols such as skulls and bones, his trippy series of artworks are likely to be enjoyed by the hipster-at-heart dad who prefers a Harley to a Jag, and Bob Dylan to Beethoven. Wedhar's works are priced from $3,400 and are available at Yavuz Fine Art on 51, Waterloo Street, where he currently has a solo exhibition. Call on 6338-7900.\n\nFor (art)clueless dad\n\nIF your father thinks the Old Masters are a bunch of ageing golfers, maybe it's a good time to enlighten him somewhat. Make the transition easy with Optical Art or Op Art, for short. The image comprises an illusion that tricks the eye and baffles the mind. The Op Art movement began in the 1960s and is popularly used in advertising today. Its famous proponents include MC Escher and Victor Vasarelly, whose works are available as posters on art.com for as little as $20. For a more contemporary take, check out Noma Bar whose elegant and minimalist Op Art works are sold on online gallery eyestorm.com. The work here, titled Look Out, is in a limited edition of 50 and retails for $1,570.\n\nIntroduce him to the real Old Masters, whose works are more accessible to the novice than contemporary art. Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Goya and da Vinci are just a few wonderful artists to check out. You'll find thousands of their gorgeous artworks on posters on art.com for a low price. Better still, make him something yourself, or with your kids, if you have any. Art jamming places such as Arteastiq and My Art Space will give you a canvas, a dozen brushes and as much paint as you want, for a set price. A painting by his kids and grandkids is bound to get any doting dad to start his own collection.\n\nFor the nostalgic dad\n\nThe images of German-born, Singapore-based shutterbug Philipp Aldrup will send a pang of wistfulness down your spine. His photo series on Capitol Theatre and Golden Mile Complex are simultaneously dramatic and poignant as they showcase two buildings that were once regarded among the most impressive in the world but which have long lost their lustre. Capitol Theatre 6 is one of his most powerful photos, as it offers a simultaneous window into the theatre's grand past, sad present and uncertain future. The photograph measures 42 by 28cm and is available in an edition of 15 from online art gallery artloft.com for US$370.\n\nFor the traditional dad\n\nA favourite among local art collectors, Tay Bak Chiang is a gifted local Chinese ink painter who interprets nature motifs in beautiful abstract forms - as seen here in his latest work Scarlet (124 x 124cm). Tay's clean, precise and elegant lines will easily appeal to dads whose tastes in art lean towards classical Chinese works with a modern twist. Tay's paintings are priced upwards of $6,800, and are currently available at HaKaren Art Gallery, which is set to open a group exhibition later this month featuring Tay and three other Chinese ink artists. You can contact the gallery on 6733-3382 or e-mail\n\ninfo@hakaren.com\n\nwith enquiries.\n\nFor the heartland dad\n\nDid your dad grow up in an old HDB block that has since been torn down? You might wish to track down acclaimed photographer Darren Soh to ask if he has a photo of that block. For more than a decade, Soh has been scouring the island for old HDB blocks, playgrounds, schools, cinemas and other buildings that were or are scheduled for demolition. He then captures them artfully in his photographs for posterity's sake.\n\nSome of these photographs are for sale. This one, for instance, depicts Block 20, Lorong 3 Geylang, before it was razed to the ground last year. The work measures 59 by 42cms and is available in an edition of 25 at online gallery theartling.com for US$600.\n\nFor the photographer dad\n\nAnyone who loves photography can see why Sebastiao Salgado is regarded as one of the greatest photojournalists of all time. His varied, global interests in social, political and economic issues see him venturing into forgotten corners of the earth with his cameras. At the moment, the Brazilian shutterbug is showing 245 stunning black-and-white photographs at the National Museum of Singapore. He is also showing numerous works at Sundaram Tagore Gallery in Gillman Barracks, which are priced between US$11,000 and US$96,000. The photo featured is called Iceberg between Paulet Islands & the Shetland Islands, Antarctica, and was shot in 2005. Stunning, isn't it?\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They're worth a total S$6.6 billion", "publish_date": null, "content": "Those squads now in Brazil? They're worth a total S$6.6 billion\n\n736 players from 32 countries among the most costly talents the sport has seen\n\nLee U-Wen\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Jun 12, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] Got just under S$6.6 billion to spare? That's the astounding amount one would need to fork out to buy the entire squad of players that are now in Brazil for the World Cup.\n\nThe 736 players from 32 countries are not only the world's best footballers, but also among the most expensive talent the sport has seen.\n\nBased on the most recent transfer prices, they are collectively worth \u00a33.13 billion, or about S$6.57 billion at today's exchange rates.\n\nIt's not that big of a surprise to see Brazil's 23-man team topping the chart with a combined value of \u00a3407 million, especially with the recent news of French league champion Paris Saint-Germain agreeing to pay Chelsea a whopping \u00a350 million for defender David Luiz.\n\nA large chunk of Brazil's total is also thanks to striker Neymar, the young Barcelona star who joined the Catalans last year for a fee believed to be worth over \u00a371 million.\n\nThe reigning World Cup champion, Spain, is second on the list with its total of \u00a3315.2 million.\n\nHead coach Vicente del Bosque has the luxury to call upon some of the planet's priciest players, including the likes of Chelsea's Fernando Torres (\u00a350 million), Manchester United's Juan Mata (\u00a337 million) and Manchester City's David Silva (\u00a323 million).\n\nIt may surprise some to see Belgium sitting pretty in third, given that it has never won a World Cup or European Championship in its history.\n\nStill, there are those who believe this star-studded squad, worth \u00a3222.7 million, could be the tournament's dark horse.\n\nMarc Wilmots' side, which begins its campaign on Day 5 against Algeria, has many household names such as English Premier League stars Vincent Kompany, Eden Hazard, Romelo Lukaku and Adnan Januzaj.\n\nAs for perennial underachievers England, the squad adds up to \u00a3179.6 million, behind heavyweights Portugal, Argentina and France but just ahead of rivals Germany.\n\nAnd what of the \"cheapest\" squad that is on show in Brazil? That would be Iran, whose 23 players are valued at a paltry \u00a33.6 million by comparison.\n\nThis could be due to several factors, such as some players remaining with their boyhood clubs throughout their careers, moving to other teams on a free transfer, or being involved in a swap deal.\n\nTransfer fees aside, the amount of wealth that will take to the pitch over the 64 World Cup matches is staggering, to say the least.\n\nEarlier this week, Wealth-X - a Singapore-based ultra high net worth intelligence and prospecting firm - released its list of the ten richest players competing in the event.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo, who plies his trade for Portugal and Real Madrid, is king of the crop with an estimated net worth of US$230 million - nearly a quarter of the combined net worth of the entire top ten.\n\nEngland has three representatives on the Wealth-X list - Wayne Rooney (US$95 million), Frank Lampard (US$60 million) and Steven Gerrard (US$55 million), while Spain has just one, Torres, who has an estimated net worth of about US$50 million.\n\nBut what of the coaches, the men responsible for leading their charges into battle at each match en route to the July 13 final?\n\nRussia's Fabio Capello is the most well-paid of all 32 national team coaches, with the Italian drawing an annual salary of \u00a37 million.\n\nEnglish coach Roy Hodgson, who is the next biggest earner, draws just half that amount, or \u00a33.5 million. Third is Cesare Prandelli who is paid \u00a32.57 million a year for his services to the Italian team.\n\nDon't blame Mexico's coach Miguel Herrera if he feels a tad envious after seeing those numbers. He has the unwanted distinction of being the lowest earner at the World Cup at just \u00a3125,000. Russia's Capello, by comparison, takes less than a week to earn that very amount.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Some 66.5 million shares with a traded value of $39.8 million changed hands.\n\nIn its announcement yesterday on the discontinuation of talks, STATS ChipPAC also said that discussions with other interested parties were still going on.\n\nDespite the hit yesterday, the price of the stock was still well above the 33 to 34 cents that it traded at before takeover speculation hit the market.\n\n\"Speculators are taking positions based on whether talks were dissolved due to disagreements or just a simple expiry of the interest to buy, which would be less negative in the market's eyes as the party could still come back to the table,\" Kevin Foy, director of equity sales trading at brokerage Maybank Kim Eng, told The Business Times.\n\nRoger Tan, chief executive officer of Voyage Research, said a 10 per cent fall was quite significant. He saw yesterday's movements as rationality returning to the market, which he thought had previously \"took it as 100 per cent that the takeover was going to happen\".\n\n\"But this was more of a rationalisation than total disappointment\" given that the sell-off did not wipe out all the gains the stock had earlier garnered, he said.\n\nAnother broker saw a brighter side of the late-morning news. While talks with the interested party had been discontinued, discussions with other parties to explore a possible acquisition were still on-going.\n\n\"There's perhaps a better suitor. The old suitor's approach was perhaps not right,\" he said.\n\nOn the talks with other parties, STATS ChipPAC said yesterday: \"There is no assurance that any such discussions will result in any definitive agreement or transaction. The company will make an appropriate announcement in the event that there are any material developments on this matter.\"\n\nSTATS ChipPAC began as ST Assembly Test Services in 1994. It was two thirds owned by Temasek Holdings when it merged with American firm ChipPAC in 2004 to create one of the world's largest chip testing and assembly entities.\n\nTemasek then made a takeover bid for the firm at $1.75 a share in 2007, ending up with an 83 per cent stake. Today, it has an 84 per cent stake.\n\nLast year, STATS ChipPAC reported a US$47.5 million net loss. Its largest segment, serving the mobile communications market, had suffered a slowdown. Consumers moved away from high-end smartphones to low-cost ones, where the company had a more limited presence.\n\nIn the first quarter ended March 30, 2014, the group reported a further US$15.8 million net loss on lower revenues of US$365.5 million.\n\nShares jumped in mid-May on takeover speculation, and the company announced that it had received a non-binding expression of interest from a third party keen on buying all its shares.\n\nEarly this month, it said other parties had contacted the company to explore a possible acquisition.\n\nYesterday, a Temasek spokesman declined to comment on the company's latest announcement.\n\nLooking ahead, based on the stock's technicals and trading activity, Mr Foy of Maybank Kim Eng expects it to trade down to around 53 cents.\n\nThis was a level \"at which, barring no additional news flow, would be a more attractive level to pick up the stock\", he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Airbus said that the cancellation followed an order placed by Emirates at the Dubai air show in November for an extra 50 A380 superjumbo planes. The cancellation decision was made following \"ongoing discussions with the airline in light of their fleet requirement review\", Airbus said.\n\nThe deal was said to be worth US$16.5 billion when it was announced in 2007, but Airbus said that customers were already interested in taking up the cancelled aircraft.\n\nThe sudden announcement by Emirates sent Airbus Group shares down more than 5 per cent at one point. The were showing a loss of 3.3 per cent to 52.08 euros in afternoon trading in Paris market, down 0.65 per cent overall.\n\nAnd in London, aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce warned that the decision would cut the value of its order book by \u00a32.6 billion (S$5.4 billion).\n\nThe cancellation \"amounts to 11 per cent of orders which Airbus expects to take in 2014\", said analyst Christophe Menard at brokers KeplerChevreux.\n\nThe airliner business accounts for the main part of activities by Airbus Group, formerly EADS, and the head of its sales division John Leahy said: \"It's not good news commercially but it has no impact financially.\"\n\nOpening an innovation show by Airbus at its headquarters in Toulouse, Mr Leahy, who has played a major role in the rise of Airbus over the years, said that he had time to find other customers for the cancelled planes which were due to be delivered from 2019. He had only just heard of the cancellation, he said, so the decision was not a direct counter-balance to the order placed in Dubai. \"I am amazed that we already have enquiries, there is already a queue of people,\" Mr Leahy added.\n\nIn Dubai, Emirates also ordered 150 Boeing very-long-haul 777-8 and 777-9 airliners which are due to enter service from 2020. It also took an option on another 50 of this version.\n\nAn Emirates spokesman said: \"The contract which we signed in 2007 has lapsed. We are reviewing our fleet requirements.\"\n\nAirlines had been making massive aircraft orders in anticipation of a pick-up in air traffic as advanced economies recover from a slump and with emerging economies expected to deliver a boost in demand.\n\nAirbus added that it was still very confident in the A350, with a fuselage made largely of composite materials, and noted that it had orders from 28 airlines for 742 aircraft six months ahead of the plane entering service.\n\n\"The programme of test flights for the A350 is progressing well and is on schedule for certification (by the Aviation Authorities) in the coming months,\" said Airbus. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The Internet has become the first choice for consuming news, entertainment and for social connectivity.\n\nIt's little wonder then that companies are increasingly moving their advertisement spend to the Web. Singapore's Internet advertising market revenue is expected to be worth US$183 million this year. From US$162 million last year, this is going to grow to US$264 million by 2018 - that's a compound annual growth of 10.3 per cent.\n\nFor context, during this period, traditional newspaper advertising revenue will grow from US$788 million in 2013 to US$905 million in 2018. While the absolute numbers are higher, the CAGR (compound annual growth rate) is 2.8 per cent. TV advertising, meanwhile, will grow with a CAGR of 3.8 per cent, taking the 2018 total to US$456 million.\n\nWithin Internet advertising, display - that is the ads that show on webpages - is the largest segment, garnering 43 per cent share of total Web advertising revenue last year. Search, however, is growing more quickly than display: paid search Internet advertising revenue is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 9.7 per cent (compared with 6.6 per cent for display) to reach US$77 million in 2018. At 30 per cent of the total Internet advertising pie, search has the second-largest share, and large global sites dominate the market as a result of Singapore's size and ethnically diverse population.\n\nThe data comes from PwC's Global entertainment and media outlook 2014-2018. PwC's Greg Unsworth says that Singapore is an affluent market and is one of the most digitally advanced on the planet. \"It possesses a very high broadband penetration (estimated at 116 per cent) and many advertising companies base their Asian regional offices in Singapore; all this helps to promote growth in Internet advertising.\"\n\nMr Unsworth, who is PwC Singapore's technology, media & telecommunications leader, however, adds that as a proportion of the total advertising spend, Singapore still lags behind many of the developed mature markets in digital advertising revenues.\n\nThe research data shows that Singaporeans are avid gamers. Total video games revenue in Singapore was US$357 million last year, up from 2009's figure of US$313 million. Revenue is forecast to grow by a CAGR of 9 per cent to reach US$550 million in 2018. \"Singapore has one of the world's highest smartphone penetration rates which, combined with gamer-friendly mobile data services, has driven mobile games revenue. In 2013, mobile games revenue accounted for 42 per cent of total video games revenue. This will fall slightly to 41 per cent in 2018, at which point mobile video games revenue would have reached US$223 million.\"\n\nOnline gaming is increasingly popular in Singapore and online games revenue will reach US$179 million in 2018. High broadband penetration has allowed the online gaming segment to flourish, as has the free-to-play model.\n\nMr Unsworth notes that, at a time when newspapers elsewhere are losing money, total newspaper advertising revenue in Singapore will continue to grow steadily in the near term. \"The average daily unit circulation total has been falling, the total had been buoyed in the past by free dailies but they are now also losing readers. However, increases in advertising revenue will more than compensate for the reduction in circulation.\"\n\nHe, however, adds that it's important for traditional media companies to understand their customers' evolving expectations in a digital world. \"Increasingly, consumers are looking for content when and where they need it on multiple platforms and devices. This is driving a number of traditional media companies to develop content for digital consumers first and foremost and then enabling this to be also distributed through traditional platforms.\"\n\nTraditional media companies need to ensure they are developing content that is relevant and available when and where consumers need it. \"Given the sharing of data by customers online, it's also important to establish trust with consumers that data will be protected and that relevant content and services are provided in return for their willingness to share personal details. Finally, traditional media companies need to encourage innovation at all levels, experiment with new business models and ensure they are developing the right talent that understands technology and are able to respond to the needs of today's consumers.\"\n\nTo a question on what is the right business model for media companies online, Mr Unsworth notes that the \"freemium\" service for online games is a good example of one model that is proving quite successful. \"Providing free access and then monetising through advertising and game upgrades is proving successful for many, particularly in China. We also expect to see development of subscription based access to books and news content continuing to evolve although unlikely to transform the industry in the short term.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He declined to confirm the identity of the buyer or the exact price.\n\nThe sale of the house, with harbour views, a private jetty and a full-floor master retreat, follows another transaction a week ago for more than A$30 million in the same suburb.\n\nTwo other properties, also in the eastern suburbs, are vying to become Australia's most expensive sales, as record-low interest rates, rising share prices and demand from overseas buyers boost demand for luxury properties.\n\n\"Like everything else, there were a lot of Asian buyers interested, but it was a matter of having the necessary approvals,\" Mr Malouf - who jointly marketed the property with Ken Jacobs, Sydney-based managing director of Ken Jacobs Real Estate, the Australian affiliate of Christie's International Real Estate - said by telephone. \"Since it ended up going to a local buyer, that wasn't needed finally.\"\n\nMedich is awaiting trial after he was charged by police in October 2010 with soliciting to murder businessman Michael McGurk. The two were involved in litigation in federal court and Mr McGurk was shot on Sept 3, 2009, outside his home in the Sydney suburb of Cremorne. Medich pleaded not guilty to the murder in November 2013 and is due to stand trial on Aug 25.\n\nAustralia's most expensive home, in the Perth suburb of Mosman Park, was sold for A$57.5 million in 2009. The A$52 million sale of the nine-bedroom mansion belonging to publisher Deke Miskin and his swimsuit-designer wife Eve, set the Sydney record in May 2013.\n\nMedich and his former wife listed the mansion in 2011, seeking A$55 million, TheAustralian newspaper said yesterday.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/transport-logistics/airbus-pitches-a380-after-emirates-snub", "site_title": "Airbus pitches A380 after Emirates snub", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nAirbus pitches A380 after Emirates snub\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Jun 12, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[TOULOUSE] A day after its biggest order cancellation ever, Airbus is back out pitching for new customers.\n\nThe planemaker was showing its Airbus A380 flagship to analysts and investors in New York yesterday, including a promotional flight over the city, with the goal of enticing US airlines that so far have shunned the world's biggest commercial jet.\n\nJoining Airbus is Mark Lapidus, a Russian-born financier who wants to lease 20 A380s to airlines. The number of customers he has won since his pledge last year to buy the plane: zero.\n\nAirbus suffered a blow on Wednesday when Emirates cancelled its entire order for 70 A350 wide-body aircraft valued at US$16 billion. While Emirates is also the biggest buyer of the A380, that aircraft has failed to attract a new airline customer in two years, raising pressure on both Mr Lapidus and Airbus to show their leasing model, so far unique to the A380, will pay off.\n\n\"Airbus has been trying to sell the A380 for 14 years now, with minimal success outside Emirates,\" said Richard Aboulafia, vice-president of the Teal Group, a Fairfax, Virginia-based advisory group. He has faulted Airbus for including the Lapidus order in its books, calling it a \"speculative\" deal that doesn't belong on the company's firm order book.\n\nYesterday's event in New York, organised by Mr Lapidus and his team at the leasing company he recently renamed Amedeo, will feature Airbus chief operating officer John Leahy as well a senior executive from Emirates to pitch the operating economics of the plane. Participants get a free 75-minute ride in an Emirates A380 above Manhattan skies.\n\nThe idea, according to Mr Lapidus, is to warm analysts and financiers to the aircraft's prospects, in a bet that once the investment community better understands the plane, airlines, too, will embrace the double-decker.\n\n\"Is this plane really something that you can lease?\" said Zafar Khan, an analyst with Societe Generale in London. \"The original concept for the A380 was this kind of bespoke flagship, highly customised cabins for each and every airline. They're trying now to make it all things to all men. It remains to be seen whether this works.\"\n\nThe A380, which typically seats about 525 people on two decks, has won orders in Europe, the Middle East, Australia and Asia, though the aircraft is absent from the fleets of carriers in the US, the world's biggest aviation market. Mr Lapidus had said his leasing plan would attract airlines that previously had shied away from the high purchase costs of the airliner.\n\nAirbus needs to broaden the customer base of the A380 if it wants to avoid unsold slots for the aircraft as early as 2015. While the plane is popular with customers, some airlines - including Deutsche Lufthansa and Air France-KLM Group - have deferred some orders. Purchase plans of carriers including Virgin Atlantic Airways remain in limbo.\n\nEmirates' cancellation, announced on Wednesday, revealed a preference for Boeing Co's planned 777X, for which the carrier has committed to buy at least 150. Still, the Dubai-based airline remains the biggest cheerleader for the bigger A380, with contracts for 140 of the 304 total ordered.\n\nAmedeo's road show for the A380 remains unusual, said Jon Bogaard, a Chicago-based attorney who specialises in aircraft financing. Carriers occasionally offer investors a sneak peek at a new model after they've already committed to the deal, he said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

More intensive developments will need to produce more greenery.\n\nThe policy to cover more areas is effective Sept 12 this year. Ng Lang, URA's chief executive officer, said this effort involves many partner agencies including developers and building owners working together.\n\nUOL Group's president (property), Liam Wee Sin, said Singapore's identity as a \"city in the garden\" distinguishes it from other cities.\n\nMr Liam said one concern would be to replace less intensive development sites with 30 per cent planted area, of which two-thirds must be on the ground.\n\nWhile more challenging, Mr Liam said this can be overcome with conscious effort and upfront planning.\n\nThus far, UOL has 10 developments under LUSH. Of these, landscaped spaces (including vertical greenery) in Parkroyal on Pickering replaces lost greenery by more than two times. For Newton Suites, the figure is 1.3 times.\n\nUnder the new initiative the bonus gross floor area (GFA) for outdoor refreshment areas on landscaped roofs in existing commercial and mixed-use developments is also extended to include new developments, areas and multiple roofs.\n\nMr Liam said LUSH has been broadly adopted by most developers. In the past two years, over half of new residential developments and a third of shopping malls, offices and hotels have taken up LUSH incentive schemes.\n\nMr Liam does not expect difficulty in convincing developers as greenery on a skyrise level is a definite benefit, and may even be a marketing tool.\n\n\"The long-term tangible and intangible benefits of having a green building will outweigh the costs,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/game-plan", "site_title": "The Game Plan", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nThe Game Plan\n\nStay calm and get through the entire World Cup tournament - even with its ungodly kick-off times of midnight, 3am and 6am - with these tips from company bosses, health experts and more, write DYLAN TAN and GEORGINE VERANO\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Jun 12, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT'S that time in four years when: productivity drops; your stockbroker doesn't return your calls; co-workers behave like the walking dead and can speak only in terms of penalties, goals and who's running the office pool.\n\nThe month-long World Cup kicked off at 4am this morning, and companies are already expecting more staff to go on medical leave while CIMB trader Manoj Chamanlal says: \"We'll definitely see a lot of football zombies over the next month\". Not just men, either. \"A lot of women are talking football these days, too, especially in my office.\"\n\nBut rather than rub their hands in exasperation, companies are surprisingly good-natured about potential lapses in the workplace over the next few weeks. Many of them are taking heed of Mr Chamanlal's \"personal request\" to employers. \"If your employees look a bit tired, please turn a blind eye just for this month.\"\n\nIn that sense, companies are taking things in their stride. Shipload Maritime Pte Ltd's CEO and managing director, Captain Raymond Ambrose, says, \"My team is quite close-knit, and I don't think the World Cup will disrupt it too much; my team is used to being disturbed at night - in their line of work, they're trained in responding and going back to sleep.\"\n\nSome even embrace it as a chance to forge bonds among employees, like Cushman & Wakefield. \"The core of our organisation is that it has a collaborative culture, we see this as a chance to bond and build relationships in an informal setting,\" says MD, Toby Dodd.\n\nNot sure how to get through the month and stay employed at the end of it? Check out this survival guide with tips from bosses and experts to make sure you emerge from the World Cup in one piece.\n\nAdvice from the top\n\n1 Pray for an understanding boss\n\nIt helps if the big guy you're working for is as into the World Cup as you are, especially one like Toby Dodd, MD of Cushman & Wakefield. Mr Dodd, who also participated in The Business Times-Coca-Cola World Cup Charity Drive, says World Cup fever has taken over their office; not only will they be wearing their favourite football shirts on Fridays, but weekly breakfasts and events will be organised for employees and clients to catch the 6am games - all paid for by Cushman & Wakefield.\n\n\"Hopefully this will motivate people to get into the office for some great World Cup banter!\" says Mr Dodd. Raymond Ambrose, CEO and MD of Shipload Maritime Pte Ltd, is as excited about the matches as his employees, saying, \"We'll probably get into the office early, since we're hooking up the monitors to the World Cup feed for the whole office.\n\n\"We may get the whole office to go out and watch in a public place, and the company will pick up the drinks tab.\"\n\nCaptain Ambrose is confident his younger employees will be able to cope with football and work but he's also prepared to give some leeway for some of his older managers who might not have the same stamina.\n\n2 Adopt an investment strategy\n\nIf you're young and energetic, you can afford to be aggressive and enjoy yourself during this event, says Wong Kok Hoong, senior vice-president of Maybank Kim Eng's Sales Trading department. \"However, if you're like me - already middle-aged and with a family - best to adopt a more cautious approach by using a mix of low-risk and low-beta strategies,\" he advises. \"Take a few selective days off, change sleeping habits a little, use technology (record the games) and be selective about which games you watch - as in investing, choose a few stocks in your portfolio and watch them carefully.\"\n\nMr Dodd recommends adjusting your day to the game you intend to watch, \"For the early games, get to bed earlier, and for the late games, start your day later. We all need our sleep, and it's important to be fresh and energised for the day ahead.\"\n\n3 Planning is everything\n\nToby Koh, MD of Ademco (Far East) Private Limited, says his secret to getting work done during the World Cup season is having really good time management and planning skills. Stock up on sleep, and if you can, work from home, but be extra-efficient and rally yourself,\" he says.\n\nAnother good tip is to fit work in between the match schedules. \"Now's a good time to make overseas conference calls in between matches, plan it well so you can still get work done. For example, I've got plans to do conference calls with America in between matches.\"\n\nHe also recommends taking leave in advance so non-football fans can cover your duties while you're enjoying the beautiful game.\n\nEat right and stay comfy\n\n1 Eat healthy\n\nDon't limit yourself to pizzas; FoodPanda.sg delivery service will have you supping like a king from the comfort of your own living room. Healthyoptions include sushi, salads and sandwiches from Maki-san to Golden Pillow's ginseng salted chickens.\n\n2 Stay stimulated\n\nYou'll need all the caffeine you can handle to get through the all-nighters you'll be pulling this month (good luck putting on your shoes without a proper pick-me--up first).\n\nThe Nespresso Inissia coffee machine ($238 at Nespresso boutiques) gets you your morning cuppa in just a few minutes with a heat-up time of 25 seconds and automatic pre-programmed coffee buttons.\n\nOtherwise try Common Man Coffee Roasters's single origin filter coffees such as Colombia Primavera (available from Common Man Coffee Roasters at $19). Filter coffee also has more caffeine than espresso-based drinks so that will get you through the day.\n\n4 Stay calm during the matches\n\nSoothe those jangly nerves mid-game with a rubdown at Tang Dynasty Massage and Spa (2 Chun Tin Road, tel: 6894-6466, advanced booking recommended) which will be extending its opening hours to dawn on the weekends. If that's not late enough, Spell Spa (278 Lavender Street, tel: 6396-8008) is open round-the-clock.\n\nIf you really can't keep your eyes open on a work day, head to We Need A Hero (57 Eng Hoon Street, tel: 6222-5590) for their quick fixes (Head, Neck & Shoulder massage, S$25 for 20 minutes; S$50 for 40 minutes) during your lunch break to return yourself to the world of the living.\n\nNo time for a massage? Keep a bottle of Spa Esprit's Lemon-Aid essential oil blend from Happy Oil Book ($30) handy to help combat fatigue.\n\n5 Relax in style and comfort\n\nWatch the game like a professional couch potato with the thickly padded Tivoli sofa, headrest and ottoman set. (Available online at www.ambientlounge.sg, at the special price of $399 during the World Cup period, usual $509). Or go with the fuss-free VIP PU Leather Bean Bag sofa and ottoman set by PiMP original bean bags. If you celebrate a little too enthusiastically when your team scores and accidentally make a mess, don't stress, the dirt wipes right off. (Available online at\n\nwww.pimpbeanbags.sg\n\n, at the special price of $299 during the World Cup period, usual $469.)\n\n6 Get driven\n\nDon't take a risk with peak-hour traffic if you're sleep-deprived; hire a private driver instead with Uber (available on Google Play, Blackberry World and iTunes App Store). Unlike regular taxis, you can track the arrival of your ride through the mobile app, allowing you to wait in the comfort of your home or spend a few more minutes in the shower. Choose between high-end sedans, SUVs or limousines. Like our Facebook page (\n\nwww.facebook.com/BTLifestyle\n\n) and get $20 free credit to try out Uber's service\n\nHealth Tips\n\n1 Go easy on drinks\n\nDon't go overboard with the beer. Sujyot Sakhrani, founder and Senior Nutritional Consultant of BIOTAILOR, a clinical and holistic nutrition company, says that stimulants like alcohol or nicotine tend to tire our bodies out and cause dehydration. Alcohol also affects the quality of your sleep, so you could end up worse for wear the day after.\n\n2 Hydrate yourself\n\nCharles Au, Verita's Naturopath and head of Research and Development, knows that football season means late nights, early mornings and poor diets. \"The challenges to our body and mind during this time are, dehydration (from the heat, alcohol and singing), disrupted sleep patterns, liver and adrenal stress,\" he notes.\n\nAs such, he says, hydration is especiallyimportant if you like a few pints with your game.\" One's diet should be focused on lots of fruits of the citrus type or watermelon,\" Mr Au adds, \"And no barbecues!\"\n\nHe also suggests salads, coconut water and healthy smoothies to replenish the minerals in your body, as well as snacking on nuts through the day to keep your energy levels up. Hydration also means you'll feel less tired.\n\n\"Basically, drink fresh, eat fresh to stay fresh,\"says Mr Au, \"Bag a few well-chosen supplements of practitioner quality and have a great time. Moderation is key, so you can have your cake and eat it too.\"\n\nMs Sakhrani adds that one cup of coffee depletes about two cups of water from your body, so for those who rely on caffeine to get them through the day, this is especially crucial.\n\nTake your supplements\n\nVitamins are key to helping your tired body pull through the tournament. You might need formulas for liver detoxification (to prevent damage caused by alcohol), Mr Au suggests oral supplements such as N-Acetyl Cysteine or Riboceine, which he says will help to regulate phase II detoxification. If your sleep cycle is being disrupted, he suggests brain formulas (nootropics) with ingredients such as 5-HTP, melatonin and activated B6 to balance brain chemistry.\n\nMs Sakhrani also emphasises the importance of consuming vitamins. which are depleted by stimulants.

With the first of 64 World Cup matches kicking off tonight, offices across the island will, for the next 32 days, probably see scores of bleary-eyed workers trooping in each morning after pulling an all-nighter to watch their favourite teams in action.\n\nProductivity will, in all likelihood, take a dip over the coming days until the tournament wraps up on the morning of July 14.\n\nA recent survey by global recruitment agency eFinancialCareers found that nearly 40 per cent of football fans plan to stay up for the matches - which kick off at midnight, 3am and 6am here on most days - and then head to work that same morning.\n\nThis was based on a poll of about 140 finance professionals who visited the agency's Singapore website. A third of them said that they would either call in sick or take leave if they had to.\n\nThe World Cup is, after all, not just any other sporting tournament. It takes place only once every four years, and it's safe to say that the excitement levels for this edition - held in Brazil, football's spiritual home, for the first time since 1950 - have reached fever pitch.\n\nBut the build-up to the big day has been marred by subway strikes, construction delays and protests by groups of Brazilians blaming their government for corruption and far exceeding the original budget for the event.\n\nPresident Dilma Rousseff rejected criticism of the inflated World Cup expenditure, insisting that preparations for the tournament would improve the country's infrastructure and give a much-needed boost to the economy over the long run.\n\n\"The result and final celebration are worth the effort,\" she said in a televised address to the nation yesterday. \"Brazil overcame the main obstacles and is prepared for the Cup, on and off the field.\"\n\nThere are, however, concerns that the opening game between the hosts and Croatia tonight (Friday 4am, Singapore time) may not proceed smoothly, given that this will be the first time the Corinthians Arena in Sao Paolo will have a full house of 61,600 spectators.\n\nWork on the stadium was still taking place earlier this week, with construction workers seen putting the finishing touches on electrical wiring and carpeting.\n\nOrganisers have promised that the stadium - also the site of a glittery opening ceremony that will be watched by a global television audience of over a billion people - will be ready on time, along with several other arenas that are desperately racing against the clock to be completed.\n\nOne can only hope that, at the end of the day, it will be the sport of football that takes centrestage at this year's World Cup.\n\nBrazil, for all its problems off the pitch of late, faces immense pressure to win the tournament on its home turf.\n\nDefeat, or even a draw, in tonight's match against Croatia would be unthinkable for the host nation, the odds-on favourites to win the famous golden trophy for a record sixth time.\n\nMany of the other 31 countries won't go down without a fight. Defending champion Spain, Argentina, Germany, Italy, France and the Netherlands are naturally fancied to do well, while dark horses such as the likes of Mexico, Uruguay, Belgium and Portugal could spring a surprise or two along the way.\n\nAsia's hopes, meanwhile, rest on the quartet of Iran, Australia, South Korea and Japan.\n\nThe South Koreans - semi-finalists back in 2002 - are in an unpredictable group with Belgium, Russia and Algeria, and will struggle to make it to the Round of 16.\n\nThe Samurai Blue, as Japan are known, will be confident of making the knock-out stage after being grouped with Greece, Ivory Coast and Colombia.\n\nIran, a team that hasn't played much of late, will probably be one of the first to fly home after the group stage. Australia, too, should depart Brazil early, given that they are the weakest team in the so-called Group of Death along with Spain, the Netherlands and Chile.\n\nAfter 820 qualifying matches spread out over two years involving 207 countries, the stage is set for one of the final 32 to reap the efforts of that hard work and go on to be crowned the best footballing nation in the world.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That's 10 million euros less than The Malton alone sold for in 2006.\n\nThe hotel, opened in 1854, is in Killarney about 290 kilometres southwest of Dublin and it's where parts of Ryan's Daughter starring Robert Mitchum was filmed. The 172-bedroom Malton is being sold together with the Metropolis Hotel in Cork and the Kilkenny Remand Hotel in the city of the same name, broker Savills plc said on Tuesday.\n\n\"This is the first portfolio of Irish hotels to be offered for sale in almost a decade,\" said Tom Barrett, head of Savill's hotel and leisure unit in Ireland. The hotels are profitable and \"considerable interest\" is expected, he added.\n\nIrish commercial property values fell by as much as two-thirds after a real estate bubble burst in 2008. An improving economy is boosting demand for business properties, which gained the most since 2006 in the first quarter. Revenue per available room, a hotel-industry measure of occupancy and rates, rose 11 per cent to 71 euros at Irish hotels last year, according to data compiled by researcher STR Global.\n\nThe decision to sell the properties was made after domestic and overseas investors approached the current owners to ask about purchasing them, according to Savills. The owners weren't identified.\n\nThe Malton sold for about 40 million euros in 2006, according to broker CBRE Group Inc. Originally named The Railway Hotel, it was built on land acquired from Lord Kenmare on the condition that he and his family would have free rail travel and that trains would be held at the station if he was running late, according to the hotel's website.\n\nOther guests to have stayed at The Malton include Princess Grace of Monaco, actor Charlie Chaplin and former Irish prime minister Jack Lynch.

The multifaceted exploration into where and how wood comes to us in its final form will be presented in a collaborative art installation - covering details as intimate as the thumbprint of a furniture restorer in Singapore to the bigger picture of deforestation in a remote Indonesian island.\n\nIt all started some five to six years ago when Davis was living in Little India, and found that \"recyclers\" weren't picking up the timber and wooden objects that get thrown out. They preferred metal or plastic objects, leaving everything else by the road side. \"So when I started collecting them, it's not like I was depriving a karung guni man of his livelihood,\" she hastens to explain.\n\nShe picked up mostly domestic objects made of wood, made prints of them and these were first featured in an exhibition in 2009 at the former Post Museum on Rowell Road. In 2010, she formed a loose \"umbrella\" project called Migrant Ecologies, which included other collaborators' art practice-led inquiries into culture and nature. They've had several exhibitions of their works in Singapore and Edinburgh.\n\nDavis is a visual artist and art writer, and assistant professor at the School of Art Design and Media (ADM), Nanyang Technological University Singapore. Her art practice and writing over the last five years concerns ways in which culture and nature in South-east Asia are imagined, represented and performed.\n\nThis is the third exhibition within Migrant Ecologies, and features the latest incarnations of the research process. \"When you get closer to the heart, you may find cracks ...\" - Stories of Wood by The Migrant Ecologies Project is an inquiry into human relationships with trees, forests and forest products in South-east Asia - explored in terms of materials, metaphors, magic, ecological resources, and history. This is a curatorial collaboration between NUS Museum and Jason Wee from Grey Projects.\n\nA 1950s teak bed salvaged from a second-hand furniture shop is the entry point into this exhibition, and artists Davis, Kee Ya Ting and Shannon Lee Castleman traced the DNA of the bed back to the location where the trees might have come from - Muna Island.\n\n\"We even found an advertisement for the bed in The Straits Times, in 1937. Then we did cell tests on the wood and made prints of the bed - which is what I've always done for the wooden objects I've found, since 2009,\" explains Davis. \"The migratory wood tells the story.\"\n\nThe imprinting of the bed is like fingerprinting the natural world and from the DNA profiling, in cooperation with Double Helix - which has devised the tracking technology to combat illegal logging - Davis and Castleman tracked the bed's wood source to Muna, south of Sulawesi. There they found an island that had its teak forests ravaged in the teak boom from the 1970s to the 90s, to the extent that it affected the water table, thus affecting water supply.\n\n\"What happened in Muna is a micro-situation of the bigger story of what's going on in South-east Asia. And that one micro-investigation of the bed brought forth different stories,\" relates Davis.\n\nCastleman's photography is mostly related to the experiences in Muna, where she documented the scale of deforestation, the replanting of teak trees and the consequences of declaring logging \"illegal\". One of her photographic series is the Tree Wounds Portraits which documents the enormous cuts seen on the older teak trees in the conservation forest on the island.\n\nCastleman explains: \"As felling teak in 'Konservasi' forests is illegal, impoverished villagers who pass by large teak trees over a period of months will give a tree one cut with an axe after another. . . until finally the tree falls or dies and no one is to blame.\"\n\nShe had brought an enormous piece of black velvet to use as a backdrop for the photos, found at the edges of the conservation forest. Overall, the narrative of Migrant Ecologies' exploration isn't just to showcase the effects of uncontrolled or \"illegal\" logging, as their micro and macro investigations showed more complex situations.\n\n\"These complex micro-macro stories have grown from the grain of the wood,\" notes Davis, citing also her encounter with an Indonesian-born timber towkay in Sungei Kadut - one of the last remaining timber factories on the Island Republic. As for the project's relevance to Singapore - its entrepot economy also played a part in the South-east Asian timber trade and therefore deforestation.\n\nDavis's exploration into wood also stemmed from the historic 1950s-60s Singapore/Malayan modern woodcut movement. \"The movement then was leftist and also poetic. Ironically, woodcut artists worked with Jelutong wood, which had also been over-harvested before.\"\n\nThe woodcuts which provided the inspiration for this six-year project will be referenced in this exhibition for the first time. Fragments of iconic woodblock prints from the NUS Museum collection are reconstructed in the show as animated shadows.\n\nThe complexities of Davis's and other artists' findings are exemplified in the title, that somehow when you get to the heart of an issue, there are several fault lines there. In line with artistic practices, the complexities will be imprinted upon the audience, though not the solutions.\n\n'When you get closer to the heart, you may find cracks. . .' - Stories of Wood by The Migrant Ecologies Project will be on from today until November at NUS Museum, University Cultural Centre, 50 Kent Ridge Crescent, National University of Singapore. Admission is free and opening hours are from 10am-7.30pm (Tue-Fri), 10am-6pm (Sat & Sun)\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Their group ROEs were much higher, between 11.5 per cent and 13.1 per cent.\n\nBarclays listed three issues facing foreign banks: margin pressure from gradual interest-rate liberalisation; slower volume growth as onshore liquidity conditions ease; and a potential rise in credit costs.\n\n\"Foreign banks generally benefited from liquidity tightness in China last year from higher returns on interest-earning assets, but interest rates have since moderated and our China economist expects more significant monetary easing in the coming weeks,\" it said.\n\nDBS Group Holdings chief executive Piyush Gupta had said last month that the bank's overall net interest margin (NIM) for Q1 2014 rose, because the bank had priced up trade loans on tighter liquidity conditions in China, as well as higher margins from new mortgage sales.\n\nThe People's Bank of China raised overnight rates to 6-7 per cent. They have since come back down to about 3 per cent, \"moderating NIM increase\", he said.\n\nHe expects China's liquidity to continue improving.\n\nBarclays said the improving liquidity will put pressure on foreign banks' margins in China and may result in lower demand for cross-border financing.\n\nBanks are also managing for slower growth amid weaker economic conditions in China, it said.\n\nStill, banks remain committed to the banking business in China despite poor returns in the near term.\n\n\"Key opportunities in the long term include the internationalisation of the RMB, the internationalisation of Chinese companies, gradual deregulation and government initiatives (eg, the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, mutual market access), development of capital markets where the foreign banks have expertise,\" Barclays said.\n\nSeparately, Maybank Kim Eng said in a June 9 report that UOB's outperformance was expected to continue and that it was cautious about OCBC.\n\nContrary to market expectations, UOB's share price continued to outperform even after posting the weakest Q1 results among the three Singapore banks because of lingering concerns surrounding the China exposure of DBS and OCBC.\n\nIn the year to June 9, UOB's share price has risen 7.1 per cent. This compares favourably with those of DBS (-0.1 per cent) and OCBC (-4.3 per cent) and the Straits Times Index (+4.2 per cent).\n\nThe brokerage said the execution risk related to the acquisition of Hong Kong's Wing Hang Bank has made investors cautious towards OCBC.\n\nOCBC's proposed $6.2 billion acquisition of Wing Hang Bank will give it an additional 15 outlets in China. It now has 16 in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.\n\nOCBC's management has said that Wing Hang Bank is a long-term acquisition, so it would be some time before the market recognises the benefits of the acquisition. \"Until then, we expect the overhang to remain,\" said Maybank Kim Eng.\n\nAs for DBS, the brokerage said that with Greater China being a key driver of the bank's prospective earnings, lingering concerns over shadow banking and the spectre of a weaker economy in China, \"DBS's share price may struggle in 2H14 until there are clearer signs that short-term interest rates are on the rise\".\n\nDBS's Q1 pre-tax profit from Greater China was 35.6 per cent; it was 25.2 per cent in 2013. OCBC's Q1 pre-tax profit from Greater China was 11.9 per cent (5.8 per cent in 2013) and UOB's was 11.4 per cent (7.6 per cent in 2013).\n\n\"Despite its outperformance, UOB's relative price to book value valuation to DBS and OCBC remains modest from a historical standpoint,\" said Maybank Kim Eng. \"We therefore think it is too early to downgrade UOB purely because of its outperformance.\"\n\nYesterday, DBS closed three cents higher at $17.06, UOB was down five cents at $22.50, and OCBC ended two cents lower at $9.77.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The official said that it was far too early to say whether the original budget would be sufficient but that final calculations for a number of expenses, including tests on the reclaimed land being used for several venues, still needed to be made.\n\nThe review will not include the new main stadium, which has been slammed for being too large for its site and too expensive to maintain after the Games, since it is being paid for by the national government and not Tokyo.\n\nPlans for the stadium, which was designed by London-based architect Zaha Hadid, who designed the aquatics centre for the 2012 London Olympics, have already been scaled back due to rising costs.\n\nBids for work to demolish the current National Stadium, built for the 1964 Olympics, had fallen through and may lead to a slight delay in construction, said an official at the Japan Sport Council, which is in charge of the arena. \"But delays will be quite minimal, not even a month or two,\" she added. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

Economists, in fact, believe that domestic costs will stay high for the rest of the year due to persistent wage pressures.\n\nThe 23 forecasters who responded to MAS' quarterly poll in late May had a median inflation forecast for this year of 2.2 per cent, down from 2.8 per cent in the March edition of the survey.

The stock opened trading unchanged at $3.86 and inched up a cent shortly after to reach the day's high of $3.87. In the early afternoon, it fell to a low of $3.84, but crept back up to close unchanged at $3.86.\n\nAnalysts The Business Times spoke to were in wait-and-see mode, saying SingTel has made a good bet, but that it is still early days - given that the management has given the currently-loss-making Amobee three to five years to become profitable and contribute to the telco's bottomline.\n\nMeanwhile, credit rating firms Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor (S&P) both said SingTel's latest acquisitions will not affect its ratings - Aa3 by Moody's and A+/Stable/A-1 by S&P.\n\nBoth ratings, a measure of credit worthiness, reflect a high-quality company subject to very low credit risk.\n\nNidhi Dhruv, an assistant vice-president and analyst at Moody's, said: \"From a financial perspective, the acquisitions are likely to dilute margins, a credit negative, and are also likely to require additional cash investment by SingTel. However, the acquisitions are small, equating to approximately 1.2 per cent of SingTel's total assets and 1.5 per cent of revenue for the 12 months ended December 2013.\"\n\nEven if both acquisitions are fully debt funded, SingTel's pro-forma leverage for financial year (FY) 2013-2014, measured by adjusted net debt or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda), would grow by only 1.5 to 1.6 times, added Ms Dhruv, Moody's lead analyst for SingTel.\n\nGiven the telco's healthy liquidity profile, Moody's said it believes SingTel has the flexibility to provide moderate financial support to its newly-acquired entities as well as its Group Digital L!fe unit.\n\nBut the unit, which recorded a negative Ebitda of $170 million (compared to the group's consolidated Ebitda of $5.2 billion) in FY2013-2014, is likely to continue making losses, although the impact on SingTel's overall finances will be limited, said Moody's.\n\nS&P said SingTel's Group Digital L!fe unit will remain a drag but will not materially affect the telco's overall operating performance or rating level.\n\nThe latest acquisitions are in line with its expectation that SingTel will spend $1.5 billion on digital life acquisitions between fiscal 2015 (year ending March 31) and fiscal 2017.\n\nIn 2012, SingTel set aside $2 billion to establish its Group Digital L!fe unit in a bid to ramp up digital advertising. To date, more than a quarter of the fund has been used, said Allen Lew, the chief executive officer of the unit and chairman of Amobee, at a media briefing on Wednesday.\n\nS&P also expects SingTel's ratio of funds from operations to debt to stay above 45 per cent in fiscal 2015. \"The pace and size of SingTel's future digital life acquisitions remain an important rating factor,\" it concluded.\n\nAmobee, which SingTel acquired two years ago for US$321 million, will buy Adconion, a cross-channel digital advertising firm, for US$209 million, and Kontera, a big-data advertising firm, for US$150 million, to become a one-stop digital-advertising platform.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But the rampant populism on display can do more harm than good.\n\nThe strikingly similar agenda being offered to voters by the two candidates, Jakarta Governor Joko Widodo and retired general Prabowo Subianto, is a blend of nationalism and protectionism that is unapologetically business-unfriendly. For instance, they both want to limit the role of foreign investment in the economy, impose taxes on exports of resources and maintain the ban on mineral ore exports. Favouring state-sponsored infrastructure projects, both are also trying to outdo each other on how many thousand kilometres of roads and rail tracks and how many airports and seaports they plan to construct, with no mention of where the funding for all this will come from.\n\nSome analysts suggest that much of this is just electoral rhetoric and that good sense will prevail once the new president is in office and actually starts to govern. Hopefully they are right. But there is a danger that nationalistic populism can take on a life of its own, especially when such ideas are seen to be vote-winners. Expectations can be created and vested interests can coalesce around policies that may then be difficult to reverse. Foreign investors would also feel uncomfortable by some of the overtones of the campaign, which even if not translated into policy, can be whipped up again and again.\n\nMoreover, sentiments can spread from one sector to others. As OCBC Bank economist Wellian Wiranto has pointed out: \"Even as the nationalistic measures may be focused predominantly on the resources sector, a policymaking atmosphere that might be misconstrued as being anti-foreigner could affect investment in other sectors, such as manufacturing, as well.\"\n\nThis is a risk that Indonesia should not be courting given that its economy is already slowing - the World Bank projects that its GDP will grow at 5.3 per cent this year, compared with an average of 5.7 per cent over the last decade. And foreign investment cannot but be part of Indonesia's growth story. The country needs not only financial inflows to cover its current account gap which is running at 3.3 per cent of GDP and but also the technological expertise in areas ranging from mining to manufacturing, to infrastructure and services.\n\nIndonesia also needs to reassure financial markets that it is serious about attending to its fiscal problems. It has a fiscal deficit which, in the absence of action to reduce fuel subsidies, could come perilously close to the legal limit of 3 per cent of GDP this year. None of these uncomfortable facts are being aired during the campaign. Hopefully when it is all over, the reality will not match the rhetoric.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A 41-storey tower rising in Seattle is the first phase of the largest condo development ever in the city. In Los Angeles, a 22-floor building is slated for construction later this year, the first ground-up high-rise condo project downtown since 2005.\n\nConstruction cranes also spike the skylines of Washington, Houston, Miami, New York and San Francisco as financing gradually returns to a real estate class that lenders shunned for years.\n\nCondos are regaining favour after a surge in rental demand pushed the US apartment-vacancy rate to the lowest level in a decade, sending urban rents soaring, while the inventory of for-sale housing remains historically low.\n\n\"We're in the very early stages of a long recovery in condos,\" said Sam Khater, deputy chief economist for Irvine, California-based CoreLogic Inc. \"Now you're seeing rental booming, but today's tenants are going to be tomorrow's condo buyers.\"\n\nBuilders broke ground on 22,000 for-sale multi-family residences last year, up 4.8 per cent from 2012 and 47 per cent from the post-crash nadir in 2010, Census Bureau data show. In the first quarter, 8.5 per cent of the 71,000 multi-family units that started construction were built as for-sale properties, up from a 6.9 per cent share a year earlier, according to the data.\n\nThat share is still far from what it was during the housing boom that peaked in 2006, when for-sale units made up 45 per cent of multi-family home starts. Developers have since focused more on apartments, catering to former homeowners who lost properties to foreclosure and younger households headed by people who can't afford to own or want more flexibility.\n\nCondo builders were burnt during the market's collapse because buyers - often investors - were able to cancel purchases once prices started falling. The outlays of money required to build the projects before deals are completed make condos the riskiest form of residential property, said John Burns, an Irvine-based real estate consultant.\n\nHigh-end condo construction started to perk up three years ago in Manhattan, San Francisco and Miami, which attracted wealthy, international buyers bearing cash. Now smaller markets are catching up as demand increases, inventory shrinks and lenders become more confident in a recovery.\n\nResale price\n\nThe median US resale condo price climbed 8.3 per cent in April from a year earlier to US$205,500, according to the National Association of Realtors. That compared with a 4.7 per cent gain for single-family homes to US$201,100. Sales of existing condos and co-ops jumped 7.3 per cent in April from March, while house sales inched up 0.5 per cent.\n\n\"The key is being able to jump in with the start of a project and finish it while the cycle is allowing you to sell condos at the number you anticipated,\" said Ted Tye, managing partner of National Development, which has pre-sold half of the 83-unit Sepia at Ink Block, scheduled to be finished next year in Boston's Southend area. \"In Boston, the window is open.\"\n\nMr Tye said he moved with his wife to Boston this year because the suburban lifestyle of nearby Newton no longer made sense after their children had grown.\n\nEmpty nesters such as Mr Tye and younger first-time homeowners flocking to urban settings are helping to fuel demand. Condo buyers pay a premium to live in higher-cost, higher-density areas, according to David Crowe, chief economist for the Washington-based National Association of Homebuilders. \"There's a lot of pent-up demand from first-time homebuyers and condos are a good first stop,\" Mr Crowe said. \"Dense developments like condos give the lifestyle they're looking for.\"\n\nSepia is one of at least three large luxury-condo projects in the pipeline in Boston. Twenty Two Liberty, a 15-storey waterfront tower, is 30 per cent pre-sold, said Joseph Fallon, president and chief executive officer of developer Fallon Co.\n\nMillennium Partners plans to open a sales centre later this year for a 442-unit building in the Downtown Crossing neighbourhood called Millennium Tower Boston. Millennium recently sold out of a 256-unit project nearby, Boston's first large new condo tower since 2009, with prices as high as US$3.5 million.\n\nThe condo market is \"off the charts strong\", said David Bates, an associate broker with William Raveis in Boston. \"There is a total lack of inventory in the market.\"\n\nIn Seattle, Bosa Development Corp expects to complete the first phase of the Insignia condo project in 2015. Since September, the company has pre-sold about 140 of the first 350 units at prices from US$400,000 to more than US$2 million. Bosa revived Insignia after originally planning to break ground before the financial crisis deepened in 2008.\n\n\"Fortunately, we didn't start,\" said Natale Bosa, president of the British Columbia-based developer. \"Otherwise, it would have been disastrous.\"\n\nBubble years\n\nRather than relying solely on bank financing, Miami-area builders often pay for condo construction with buyer deposits for sometimes more than half the retail price of the units. Unlike the bubble years, buyers probably won't walk away from these deals because they have so much skin in the game, said Jenny Huertas, the broker for CVR Realty in Miami.\n\n\"This time is different,\" she said. \"We don't see a bubble happening because the deposits are so big and that means real buyers.\"\n\nLenders may not offer mortgages to buyers in condo buildings with large numbers of tenants.

In April, prices rose 1.8 per cent, sparking fears that inflation could fall into negative territory amid slowing economic growth.\n\nA rise in pork prices and a low base effect were the main drivers of inflation last month, figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics showed.\n\nFood prices rose 4.1 per cent in May from a year earlier, quickening from April's 2.3 per cent rise, the data showed.\n\nThe producer price index (PPI) - a measure of costs for goods at the factory gate and an indicator of the trend for CPI - fell 1.4 per cent last month from a year earlier, versus a 2 per cent decline in April and market forecasts for a 1.5 per cent drop.\n\nThis is the 27th straight month of decline and a sign of widespread overcapacity in the economy and weak internal demand.\n\nYesterday's figures come after a slight rebound in PMI and trade last month and are further evidence that growth has bottomed out and demand has stabilised.\n\n\"As we are now beginning to see monthly data picking up, the logical question is whether more easing will be needed,\" economists at HSBC said in a research note.\n\n\"Given that underlying activities remain relatively sluggish and funding costs (for companies) remain high, we think there is still a lot more policymakers can do. In fact we expect policymakers to stay in their current easing mode, and deliver more targeted and incremental easing measures . . .\"\n\nThe rebound in the inflation rate last month is well under the government target of 5 per cent for the year. This could leave more room for the central bank to ease credit conditions to support the economy, which grew 7.4 per cent in the first quarter of this year.\n\nNonetheless, the central bank has said that monetary easing is not an option. Beijing, keen to wean out overcapacity and worried about non-performing loans on banks' balance sheets, has repeatedly said that it would not introduce aggressive stimulus measures.\n\nOn Monday, the People's Bank of China said that it would cut the reserve requirement ratio for banks that have loans to the farming sector and to small and medium-sized firms.\n\nThe move followed a cut in April for county-level rural commercial banks and rural cooperatives.\n\nEconomists reckon that these measures will have little impact on liquidity flowing into the banking system and do not expect the cut to be extended to major commercial banks. They expect inflation to remain subdued for the rest of the year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He later denied having any designs on a life-time presidency.\n\nIsolated boos could be heard among the applause as Mr Blatter said that conditions were good for him to seek a fifth term next year. But he has a strong chance of victory in the election to be held at the Fifa congress in Zurich in May next year.\n\n\"My mandate will finish next year . . . but my mission is not finished,\" he said in his closing address. \"Together we will build the new Fifa, together we have the foundations to do things.\" he added: \"Congress, you will decide who will take this proud institution forward. It's your decision to do so. But I will tell you, I'm ready to accompany you in the future, for the game, for the world.\n\n\"Because it's your decision congress, if you want to go with me,\" he said, exiting to clapping and Brazilian music.\n\nMr Blatter has dropped heavy hints in past months that he will be a candidate again, even though he said when he won in 2011 that it would be his last term.\n\nDespite stopping short of formally announcing his candidacy, his comments are likely to vex European delegates who this week called for him to stand down next year.\n\nMr Blatter has long been a controversial figure, and Fifa, which oversees a multi-billion dollar industry, has never been far from scandal.\n\nJust prior to the World Cup, Britain's The Sunday Times has published a series of reports alleging that millions of dollars in bribes were paid to help Qatar secure the 2022 edition.\n\nMr Blatter succeeded scandal-plagued Brazilian Joao Havelange in 1998. Under his stewardship, football's revenues have mushroomed, with huge amounts from television rights and sponsorship.\n\nBut it has also attracted scandal, the latest of which is led by media reports that Qatar's Mohamed bin Hammam paid more than five million dollars in bribes to win support for the Gulf state's 2022 World Cup bid.\n\nQatar has denied any wrongdoing, and Mr Blatter has said that the corruption allegations are racist. But the scandal has still tainted the build-up to the start of the Brazil World Cup yesterday.\n\nIn a rare public comment on the issue, former Fifa executive committee Junji Ogura from Japan said that most senior figures want the truth unearthed and welcome the spotlight on the scandal-hit organisation.\n\n\"There are a lot of people in the executive committee who feel that way, and it's why things are being investigated,\" he told Kyodo News in Sao Paulo.\n\n\"If it's made clear what is allowed and what isn't allowed, then people will stop doing these things. Everything ought to come to light - in black and white,\" said Mr Ogura, who was on Fifa's top committee from 2002 to 2011.\n\nThe colourful Mr Blatter lived up to his eccentric image when he danced on stage at the congress and even suggested an inter-planetary version of the World Cup.\n\nHe was given a standing ovation by African and Asian confederations when he went to their meetings in Sao Paulo this week.\n\nThe Swiss enjoys strong support among those blocs, which owing to their size constitute a powerful voting force within Fifa.\n\nBut he had a poor reception when he went to the European confederation, Uefa, where some delegates called for him to stand down when his term ends.\n\n\"Something like this, lacking respect like I saw and heard in the Uefa meeting, I have not had in my entire life,\" he told reporters after the congress.- AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Singapore accounted for nearly 65 per cent of services FDI inflow into Asean in 2010-11.\n\nMore than half of FDI inflows into Asean in 2010-11 were services FDI, and the report projected that Asean demand for services is likely to rise with rising per-capita incomes and urbanisation in the region.\n\nThe report noted that Singapore's export orientation may thus be increasingly via tradable services, especially with mid to low-end manufacturing increasingly relocating to other parts of Asean.\n\nThe Republic will need to deal with the pressures of cost normalisation, however.\n\nCiti Research's report suggested that cost normalisation need not undermine export competitiveness but Singapore is less well placed to cope.\n\nAside from Singapore's high price levels, the report also said that the country being \"closer to the technology frontier\" means that it has less scope to offset future wage increases by increasing productivity.\n\nSectors in Singapore potentially most affected by wage normalisation include higher-end manufacturing and non-tradable or net importing services such as government and healthcare services.\n\nDespite such caveats, Citi Research remained bullish overall about Asean's prospects for sustained economic growth, calling investor fears about Fed tapering and China's economic rebalancing \"misplaced\".\n\n\"Not only will Asean continue to reap dividends from favourable demographics, rising consumption and urbanisation, but we see new levers for a sustained era of economic success,\" it said.\n\nUnlike China, which could see its working age population start to decrease before 2020, according to United Nations projections, demographics in Asean are more favourable.\n\nThe working age population in Asean was 67 per cent in 2011 and is expected to grow until 2020-24, the report noted.\n\nThe report also advised Asean countries to turn to export-oriented segments like manufacturing.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Howard Hughes Corp revived the development last year after the previous owner, General Growth Properties Inc, shut it down in 2008.\n\nThe commercial real estate market in Las Vegas, littered with vacant buildings and abandoned construction sites by overreaching developers during the US property crash, is coming back to life as the local economy improves and tourists return to the nation's gambling capital. Blackstone Group LP's deal to buy the Cosmopolitan resort and Genting Bhd's proposed resurrection of an abandoned project on Las Vegas Boulevard are further signs of investor confidence in the nascent recovery.\n\nLas Vegas \"kind of went through this frozen period\", said John Matt Stater, research manager for brokerage Colliers International in the city. \"Over the last year we really got the blood pumping now, and things are moving fast.\"\n\nBlackstone, the world's largest alternative asset manager, agreed last month to buy the two-tower Cosmopolitan complex on the Las Vegas Strip from Deutsche Bank AG for US$1.73 billion. The bank had foreclosed on the hotel and casino after developer Ian Bruce Eichner defaulted on a construction loan in 2008. The resort cost more than US$3.9 billion to build and has not turned a profit since opening in December 2010.\n\nBlackstone's purchase is \"a big signal\", said Charles Moore, a property sales broker at CBRE Group Inc in Las Vegas. \"It raises eyebrows and awareness that Las Vegas is back.\"\n\nFor years, investors shunned Las Vegas as it struggled in the aftermath of the housing bust and economic downturn, which sent the jobless rate to as high as 14.5 per cent. Las Vegas was the centre of US housing speculation during the real estate boom that peaked in 2006, and followed with the nation's worst foreclosure crisis.\n\nHome prices in Las Vegas slid 62 per cent before bottoming in March 2012, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller index. They have since climbed 46 per cent, fuelled in part by investors such as Blackstone buying foreclosed single-family houses to rent out.\n\nIn April, the unemployment rate in the area dropped to 7.4 per cent, the lowest since 2008, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show. Visitors to Las Vegas have also picked up, helping support leisure and hospitality jobs, the biggest part of the workforce at 31 per cent, according to Francis Yuen, a senior real estate economist at CoStar Group Inc. \"It's one of the last markets to recover,\" he said.\n\nDemand for apartments is rebounding along with the labour market. Tenants paid an average of US$829.62 a month in the first quarter, data from Reis Inc show. That is up from US$774.86 two years earlier, the lowest point in the real estate slump.\n\nRental projects under construction include the Calida Group's 360 unit Elysian at the District, scheduled to open early next year in Henderson, a Las Vegas suburb. The luxury complex will have three clubhouses, a gym and pet spa, according to Eric Cohen, managing director at the Las Vegas-based developer. His company plans to start work on two other properties, one with 124 apartments in Downtown Summerlin, a joint venture with Hughes Corp.\n\nThe office market is still in the doldrums. The challenge for landlords, who added excess space in the boom, is that the leisure, hospitality and construction industries, drivers of the local economy, are \"light on office use\", Mr Yuen said.\n\nAsking office rents averaged US$23.73 in the first quarter, compared with US$23.85 a year earlier, according to Reis. The vacancy rate was little changed at about 26 per cent - the second worst among 79 US markets, trailing only Dayton, Ohio.\n\nCasino operators are building nightclubs, dining venues and retail centres to appeal to visitors who want other entertainment options as gambling spending falls. Gaming revenue in Clark County, Nevada, which includes Las Vegas, was US$9.7 billion in 2013, below the peak of US$10.9 billion in 2007, according to the city's Convention and Visitors Authority.\n\nMGM Resorts International, the largest casino operator on the Strip, and Los Angeles-based AEG are constructing a US$375 million, 20,000 seat arena that will host boxing and other sporting events, concerts and awards shows. AEG, a unit of Anschutz Co, owns the Los Angeles Kings National Hockey League team and part of the National Basketball Association's Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nMGM, based in Las Vegas, is also developing the Park, a complex of bars and restaurants that will connect its New York New York and Monte Carlo resorts. Both the Park and the arena are scheduled to open in 2016.\n\nGenting, a casino operator controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay, bought an 87 acre site on the Strip last year from Las Vegas-based Boyd Gaming Corp for US$350 million. Boyd stopped work on what was to be known as Echelon in 2008. Genting plans to restart construction this year on the US$4 billion project, now called Resorts World Las Vegas.\n\n\"MGM, Genting - all these are companies that could make investment decisions all over the world,\" said Kevin Orrock, president of Summerlin, the 22,500 acre master-planned community that includes the Downtown Summerlin project, for Dallas-based Hughes Corp. \"This is smart money coming in, or smart money that's been here, that realises that there's future potential for this community.\"\n\nAlso under construction on the Strip are the US$415 million overhaul of the former Sahara, scheduled to debut on Labor Day weekend as the SLS Las Vegas Hotel & Casino, and Grand Bazaar Shops, outdoor mall with more than 150 stores that is being developed by a group including casino operator Caesars Entertainment Corp. The retail project, at the entrance to Bally's at Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo Road, is expected to open by year's end.\n\nThe budding recovery has not breathed life into all mothballed projects.

His campaign comes amid pressure from sponsors over corruption allegations linked to the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.\n\nMr Blatter took office in 1998 and the ruling body has had to deal with other crises, including the expulsion of Mohamed Bin Hammam, a former ally who stood against Mr Blatter in 2011. The Qatari quit the race days before an investigation into claims he tried to bribe voters in the Caribbean with envelopes stuffed with US$40,000, leaving Mr Blatter unopposed.\n\n\"In the last eight or nine years, Fifa has built an ugly reputation, not only in the press but you only have to look at Twitter - #Fifa #Blatter #Fifa Mafia,\" Dutch Football Association chairman Michael van Praag told Mr Blatter after the Fifa president told delegates from the 54 members of European governing body Uefa that the global organisation was in the middle of a storm. \"There are reasons - bribery, money and corruption are so often linked,\" he added. \"Fifa has a bad reputation. Fifa has an executive person and if you like it or not, you have a responsibility.\"\n\nHis remarks came a day after members of African soccer's confederation gave Mr Blatter a standing ovation when he told them of his re-election plans. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

The Santa Monica-based firm, founded in 2005, provides multi-channel digital advertising solutions - mobile, video, email, display and social - across all devices, on a unified platform.\n\nKontera, a big data advertising firm founded in 2003 with offices in the US, UK and Israel, enables advertisers to serve the most relevant advertisements to users and make real-time decisions about their brands and marketing campaigns, via its real-time digital content analysis platform. It will be acquired for US$150 million.\n\n\"Amobee's mission is to be the global leader in mobile-led digital advertising. With these latest acquisitions, I believe we will have an integrated solution that can even one-up Google,\" Mark Strecker, chief executive officer of Amobee, told The Business Times.\n\nFor instance, if a user searches for Louis Vuitton (LV) bags on Google, Google AdSense may show up images or advertisements related to the French fashion brand, but it does not know (with certainty) if the user wants to purchase a LV bag there and then, he said.\n\nAmobee's digital advertising solution, which will integrate Kontera's real-time analytics technology and Adconion's multi-channel capabilities, can do that, he claimed.\n\nIt will track in real-time all the sites the user is on (for instance, an e-commerce or fashion site), as well as his geo-location, so as to determine his buying intent, allowing for better personalised advertising and return on investment.\n\nThe integration of both companies into Amobee will be fairly straightforward, and likely to be completed by the fiscal year end, added Mr Strecker.\n\nAdconion will contribute to Amobee's sales, while Kontera - bringing its real-time technology - will boost Amobee's engineering capabilities.\n\n\"Mobile and digital advertising are the engines of growth for advertisers today. As more users get locked in a 'contextual mobile moment of need', the opportunity to insert highly-personal, contextualised advertising will be the goal for all brands,\" said Forrester's telco analyst Clement Teo.\n\n\"SingTel has made a good bet, but it remains to be seen how it will use the new digital tools to add value for its clients,\" he added.\n\nOCBC Investment Research analyst Carey Wong agreed, saying it is still early days yet. \"SingTel's management has also alluded it may still take three to five years for Amobee to break even and become profitable, so I guess we have to be patient as well.\"\n\nThe telco's latest investment comes while Amobee is still running at a loss and not contributing to the group's bottomline.\n\n\"It's not just about cash and profitability ... but value too. There is value in Amobee, even though it is currently loss-making,\" said Allen Lew, CEO of SingTel's Group Digital L!fe and chairman of Amobee.\n\nHe added that Amobee needed a \"transformative acquisition\" - buying Adconion and Kontera would be a game-changer for the Redwood City-based mobile advertising firm.\n\nLast year, Amobee acquired Los Angeles-based GradientX for about US$15 million, to add real-time bidding technology onto its platform.\n\nIn 2012, it acquired Palo Alto-based AdJitsu for an undisclosed price to bring in 3D technology.\n\nIn the same year, SingTel set aside $2 billion to establish its Group Digital L!fe unit to capitalise on the global digital advertising market - primed to hit US$100 billion in 2017, according to eMarketer.\n\nWith the latest acquisitions, and including what Amobee spent last year, over a quarter of the $2 billion has been used, revealed Mr Lew.\n\nYesterday, SingTel's shares opened flat at $3.86 and reached $3.87 shortly after the deal to buy Adconion and Kontera was announced.\n\nThe counter closed unchanged at $3.86.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

GENEVIEVE CUA reports\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Jun 10, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWEALTH managers' cost-to-income ratio improved in 2013, helped largely by asset appreciation. But Boston Consulting Group (BCG) warns in its latest global wealth report that the improvement may not be sustainable as cost levels have actually remained high.\n\nAsia-Pacific wealth managers' cost-to-income ratio showed the greatest improvement from 71 per cent previously to 67 per cent. This is below the global average of 70 per cent.\n\nBCG said asset growth and corresponding revenue increases have taken some pressure off the cost side for wealth managers. But overall costs still rose by 3.5 per cent. \"If equity markets lose their momentum for any length of time, pressure will rise again - putting some players under duress.\" BCG said the cost increase of the past few years should signal a \"call to action\".\n\nIn the latest wealth report, global wealth rose 14.6 per cent to US$152 trillion, largely thanks to the strong equity market rebound. Equity markets rose an average of 20.6 per cent last year. Equities comprise some 30 per cent of the average investor's portfolio. The Asia-Pacific, ex-Japan, was the fastest-growing region, with wealth rising at a 10.5 per cent clip to US$61 trillion.\n\nBCG's business analysis is found in its benchmarking survey, which looks into the performance of more than 130 institutions, either pure private banks or wealth management units of large universal banking groups.\n\nIn terms of assets under management (AUM), the Asia-Pacific registered the strongest growth of 24 per cent, with net new assets accounting for 10 percentage points. This is much stronger than the global average AUM growth of 11 per cent, of which net new assets accounted for 4 percentage points.\n\nGlobally, revenues rose 8 per cent for wealth managers, stronger than the 5 per cent increase in 2012 and 7 per cent in 2011. The largest increase was in fees which rose 10 per cent. Commissions expanded by 5 per cent, and net interest income fell 7 per cent. BCG said these numbers reflect a \"slight shift\" towards fee-based pricing, which is expected to gain momentum in the coming years due to regulatory changes.\n\nDiscretionary mandates' share of business was stable at 21 per cent globally. While European managers raised their share of discretionary mandates from 27 to 30 per cent, the Asia-Pacific managers' share remained small at just 5 per cent. BCG said some players in the region managed to raise this share to 10 per cent or higher.\n\nDespite higher AUMs, revenue growth lagged. The average return on assets dropped 5 basis points in the Asia-Pacific from 70 to 65 basis points.\n\nIn terms of costs, the largest increase of 32 per cent was in legal, compliance and risk management costs. This item accounted for 4 per cent of total costs. Sales and front-related services costs rose 14 per cent on a global basis, and accounted for 57 per cent of total costs.\n\nThe Asia-Pacific managers increased the number of relationship managers (RMs) by 21 per cent. RM remuneration in the region accounted for 16 per cent of revenues, below the global average of 25 per cent.\n\nBCG's report also shares insights into revenues per RM. This metric is a function of client assets and liabilities (CAL) per RM as well as revenue margins. RMs managing assets for the affluent segment (clients with AUM of US$500,000 to US$1 million) can be expected to manage total CAL of US$150-250 million. For high net worth clients (AUM greater than US$1 million), CAL per RM rises to US$250-350 million. For upper high net worth clients (AUM in excess of US$10 million), the CAL per RM may rise to US$600 million.\n\nIn terms of revenue margins, the most attractive is the affluent segment at 107 basis points. Margins of the high net worth segment stood at 81 basis points, followed by 44 basis points for the upper HNW business.\n\nBCG said wealth managers' efforts to reduce costs and raise efficiency have been commendable. \"But these initiatives require a continuing strong focus, because the asset appreciation witnessed over the past two years is expected to slow down eventually.\" It also points out that new wealth continued to be a significant factor, representing 22 per cent of total wealth creation last year. Wealth managers thus need to strengthen their asset gathering capabilities.\n\n\"They must gear their organisations towards capturing newly created wealth, not just riding the asset appreciation wave or attempting to gain market share from other players.\"\n\nIt also listed a number of promising strategies - to clearly define the target client segment, for instance, and craft a tailored offering; and to embrace digital technology. In terms of digital technology, BCG said this is developing slowly among wealth managers, even as their clients expect their banks to be on the cutting edge.\n\nBCG said that while the traditional private banking relationship will continue to emphasise face-to-face contact, \"technology will radically redefine and enhance that relationship\". It painted a picture of seamless, instant interaction with RMs through tablets or smartphones to dicuss investment opportunities, for instance.\n\n\"Yet, change is coming more slowly to wealth management than to other industries with many players unable to leverage digital technologies in a way that truly enhances their offering.\"\n\nAt the moment, most wealth managers' digital services are web-based. BCG expects that another two to three years will pass before tablets and smartphones reach a similar level of trust and usage.\n\nWhile access to portfolio and account information and ability to trade are commonly offered, more sophisticated functions such as personalised portfolio monitoring and identification of investment opportunities are not typical. The least developed aspect is communication. Few banks enable video interactions between clients and RMs, for instance, or send relevant alerts to clients. Such alerts can empower clients to act instantly on events, such as the downgrade of a stock, said BCG.\n\nOn average, only 1- 2 per cent of any wealth manager's employees are dedicated to managing the digital interface. \"Many banks have no resources at all, indicating a hesitation to invest in this area.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Gulf airlines have become a \"major concern\" as fares come under pressure, while a pilot strike and currency changes are also weighing on earnings, Lufthansa said.\n\n\"It's a tough competitive landscape, but these are not new things and its something Lufthansa has no choice but to handle,\" said John Strickland, an aviation specialist and director of JLS Consulting Ltd in London. \"This is a moment in history for the Gulf carriers and it's not going to go away.\"\n\nLufthansa slumped as much as 2.47 euros, or 12.4 per cent, to 17.44 euros in Frankfurt, the steepest declined since April 2009. The loss clipped this year's advance to 13 per cent.\n\nPrices are under most pressure on European and American routes, with Gulf carriers \"advancing ever further\" into Europe and also beginning to invest in its airlines, chief financial officer Simone Menne said in the statement. Etihad Airways of Abu Dhabi has taken stakes in carriers including Air Berlin Ltd, one of Lufthansa's biggest rivals.\n\n\"This is clearly surprisingly negative,\" Investec analyst James Hollins said in a note to investors. \"The implications on future Europe and North America yields are that trading will remain poor through the second half of 2014.\"\n\nA pilot strike in early April trimmed earnings by 60 million euros, with bookings only recently returning to normal, the carrier said. Venezuelan moves curbing repayment of dollar debt also cost the equivalent of 60 million euros in bolivar receivables, with Lufthansa halting Caracas for a few days.\n\nThe airline, which is seeking to respond to the Gulf challenge by lifting service levels with new seats and enhanced catering, will \"noticeably reduce\" capacity next winter, Ms Menne said. The company will unveil a more comprehensive restructuring plan next month, with \"everything on the table\" in terms of possible cost reductions, she said.\n\n\"We are achieving a sustainable reduction of our unit costs and now aim to stabilise the revenue trends, in order to counteract an ever intensifying competitive situation,\" she said in the release. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Daily freight rates for multi-purpose vessels are currently US$9,000-US$10,000, and Mr Stadil said US$15,000 per day was a normal level.\n\n\"Many new ships were ordered in the years ahead of the financial crisis.

The sale of the larger land parcel provides greater flexibility for building design, layout and placement of uses. It will also facilitate the development of Paya Lebar Central into a commercial node, which is in line with the government's objective of decentralising employment centres and bringing jobs closer to homes,\" MND said.\n\nThe earlier plot has a drain running diagonally across it, severely constraining any potential design scheme. While the additional plot to its north also has a drain running through it, the drain divides the plot into two more regular-shaped rectangular plots, which would allow a developer to put a tower on each half. Market watchers reckon that besides a minimum office component, the enlarged sale site is likely to have retail and residential elements, and possibly hotel uses too.\n\nThe enlarged Paya Lebar site can generate about 167,160 square metres (nearly 1.8 million sq ft) gross floor area (GFA), compared with 86,940 sq m for the old plot. This will limit participation at its tender to big players, say market watchers.\n\nWith the focus on decentralisation, two sites for office developments in the city - a commercial site on Beach Road and a \"white\" site in Marina View - will take a \"back seat on the reserve list\", said JLL national director Ong Teck Hui.\n\nThe 2.14-ha Beach Road plot, a new site that includes the former Central Police Station grounds, can generate 89,880 sq m GFA of commercial space.\n\nThe Marina View plot, which can produce about 101,400 sq m GFA, has been on the reserve list for more than two years, though MND yesterday announced a new sale condition: banning strata subdivision of office space for the future project on the site.\n\nThis is \"in line with the vision for quality office developments within Marina Bay, Singapore's key financial and business district\", it said.\n\nOver in the Holland Village area, the 2.31-hectare site is estimated to yield about 580 private residences in addition to 13,500 sq m GFA of commercial space. It is being placed on the H2 confirmed list as part of the Holland Village Extension plan unveiled in Master Plan 2014.\n\n\"It will provide new housing options within a mixed-use development that is well connected via pedestrian linkages to surrounding transport nodes and public spaces,\" MND said.\n\nWhen contacted by The Business Times, URA said an existing car park that will be part of the sale site will be shut by the first half of next year to facilitate development of the sale site.\n\nFuture development on the site will provide parking lots to meet the demand in the area. In the meantime, an interim car park will be built to replace the public parking lots affected.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The JV's plant will occupy about a third of this facility, which sits on a 5.57-hectare plot, Mr Pek said.\n\nGeostr will provide the expertise in making tunnel segments, which requires more stringent precision and quality than the precast segments Tiong Seng is used to making for the construction of buildings. The JV will also leverage on Marubeni's distribution network, he added.\n\nProduction is targeted to start in the first half of next year, so \"the contribution (to our bottom line) will not be so immediate\", Mr Pek said.\n\nThe JV will sell the precast segments it makes to the contractors involved in MRT construction projects. Tiong Seng itself will likely also purchase precast segments from the JV for the $316 million contract it recently clinched to build the Great World Station and tunnels along the Thomson Line.\n\nCurrently, most of the tunnel segments supply for MRT projects are sourced from companies with production factories in Johor, such as SPC Industries (a unit of Malaysian conglomerate Kimlun Group), Contech Precast (a unit of Singapore-listed Koon Holdings) and Hume Group (a unit of Hong Leong Group).\n\n\"This precast product has always been in the market, so it is not something new, but we are seeing the market demand increasing because of the MRT expansion projects,\" Mr Pek told BT.\n\nAnother reason that prompted its decision to get into tunnel segment production was its struggling property development division, he admitted.\n\nIn its latest concluded fiscal quarter, losses from this division deepened to $2.7 million, due to the difficult real estate environment in Singapore and China, where it is developing properties in some second and third-tier cities.\n\nIts share price has fallen 25 per cent since the start of this year and is now trading at a 31 per cent discount to its net asset value per share as at end-March.\n\nBut it may now stand to benefit from the government's urging of developers to adopt pre-fabrication methods - assembling parts of the building in other facilities before installing them at the site - to improve the construction sector's dismal productivity.\n\nTiong Seng's counter ended 0.6 cent, or 3.2 per cent, higher at 19.6 cents yesterday. On the Tokyo stock exchange, Geostr rose 4 per cent to 801 yen while Marubeni added 0.4 per cent to 717 yen.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

China won't be growing at 10 per cent any more, but it'll still be growing. Singapore will be positioned to take advantage of the regional growth.\"\n\nSingapore also has other strengths going for it, he added: \"Singapore is run by very proactive and thoughtful people. Its role as a technology leader will be what insulates it against dislocation in the manufacturing area.\"\n\nAlthough cynics predict that the shale gas revolution in the US may fizzle out, Mr Bolte is bullish about its potential.\n\n\"I don't see it as a bubble,\" he said, adding that many fields can be used to produce shale gas.\n\nThe shale revolution in the US, triggered by new technologies in hydraulic fracturing or fracking and horizontal drilling in the past decade, has lowered natural gas prices there and reduced the US' dependency on imported crude oil.\n\nFracking involves pumping water, chemicals and sand at high pressure to open up cracks in impermeable shale rock, which is a major reservoir of oil and natural gas.\n\nOver in Europe, prospects look dismal. It is staring into a future with \"very high energy costs, very strong laws - almost onerous ones from a compliance standpoint - and very strong environmental lobbyists that don't like fracking\", said Mr Bolte.\n\nIn three to five years, the high energy costs European manufacturers will have to pay will be burdensome, he added.\n\nBDP International, a family-owned firm which counts companies such as Dow Chemicals and Johnson & Johnson as its customers, predicts that trade flows will shift from the traditional East-West pattern to a North-South one within the region.\n\nMr Bolte, who was in town for the group's 20th anniversary celebrations in Asia, said: \"The era where China makes everything and ships it somewhere is coming to a close.\"\n\nThe region has been a strong driver of growth for the firm, and now makes up a quarter of its activity - despite the group having established its first Asian office in Hong Kong as recently as 1994.\n\nThe group opened its Singapore office, now its regional headquarters, with a headcount of 220 employees in June 1995.\n\nBDP International now hires more people in Asia than in the US, where it is headquartered; it has 1,400 employees in 10 countries in Asia-Pacific, compared to 1,100 in the US. Some 65 per cent of the privately held group's US$2.1 billion comes from chemical logistics, with consumer products and healthcare being two other key sectors for the firm.\n\nLooking ahead, BDP International, which has drawn up a strategic five-year plan, will focus on five key areas: strengthening its brands to retain its customers in a rapidly growing industry; shifting towards outsourcing solutions rather than only moving shipments; focusing on service excellence as a way of deepening its relationships with existing customers; merger-and-acquisition opportunities; and growing in traditional products.\n\n\"The net result is that we expect to double the size of BDP in five years,\" said Mr Bolte.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth/wealth-investing/no-reason-doubt-cpfs-intentions", "site_title": "No reason to doubt CPF's intentions", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nNo reason to doubt CPF's intentions\n\nTo understand the CPF, we must understand that its primary purpose is to help us meet our basic retirement needs\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Jun 10, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nI KNOW for a fact that many of us do not really understand our CPF (Central Provident Fund) well. To many, it is just one of the many ways our government \"hoards\" our assets. Over the past two weeks, online postings and discussions have brought this mistrust to a higher level.\n\nTo understand the CPF, we must understand that its primary purpose is to help us meet our basic retirement needs. It is on this premise that the scheme was built upon and it is from this perspective that we must look from. All other uses of CPF monies are meant to support this purpose. Therefore, rules are set such that if you use your CPF monies for housing, children's education, insurance, paying medical expenses and investments, they must either help you in your retirement or not affect your retirement.\n\nAn example would be if you use your Ordinary Account (OA) monies to fund your children's education at one of the local universities or polytechnics. One year after they leave the course, your children have the obligation to pay back the money plus interest not earned by their parents in their OA. Another example will be, if you want to top up say, your parents' CPF account using your own CPF monies, you can't do it unless you have met your own minimum sum as CPF is meant for your own retirement, not your kids' education, nor someone else's retirement.\n\nIn the same vein, if you sell your property that was funded by CPF for the purchase, you need to put back the amount you have used plus the accrued interest not earned (if you had kept it in the OA), back into your OA. It is not that you are paying interest for your own money, but rather, this is to be sure that your retirement money is there when you need it.\n\nFor this purpose, the CPF Board was started on July 1, 1955. Life was hard then and the government at that time feared that our forefathers might not have the knowledge and ability to save for their retirement. CPF became a form of forced savings for them. When Singapore was forced to leave Malaysia and became independent in 1965, we were struggling to survive and many needs arose. The government implemented schemes to meet those needs, such as Public Housing (1968), Medisave (1984), the Minimum Sum (1987), Medishield (1990), CPF Investment (1997) and CPF Life (2008), while keeping the primary purpose of the CPF in mind.\n\nMinimum Sum Scheme (MSS, 1987)\n\nEach year, at the end of the Chinese New Year season, my children always excitedly count how much money they have collected in their angpows (red packets) and plan for the things they want to buy. This is when my wife steps in, takes a portion of the money and \"force saves\" it on the children's behalf, in their bank accounts. The\n\nchildren are left with some money to spend, usually on unnecessary things. Are they happy? Never. But we know that they will grow up seeing a pretty decent sum in their account, and knowing that their parents always have their welfare in mind.\n\nThe MSS works on this same principle. At age 55, before one can take all their CPF monies (and we have heard stories of how people use it up very quickly on unnecessary things), the CPF board will take a portion of it (known as the Minimum Sum or MS) and deposit it into their Retirement Account (RA). At age 62 (previous draw down age or DDA), the retirees get a monthly annuity till about age 82. However, with Singaporeans now living longer beyond 85 years old, the old MSS became dated. CPF Life was therefore launched to bridge this gap.\n\nCPF Life (2008)\n\nThe objective of CPF Life is simple. To give a retiree a lifelong income stream till his death, the CPF Board made two changes to the old MSS:\n\nAs a result, based on the new MS of $155,000 in July 2014, a couple contributing this amount to their own RA will have about $2,400 per month till their demise. If they die early, the unused portion of their monies will be given back to their beneficiaries.\n\nThe hottest debate now\n\nAllow me to share with you a parable. Two men, Peter and John, struck an agreement with each other. Peter will lend to John $100,000 on the understanding that John will pay Peter a guaranteed 4 per cent per annum with no risk of losing the capital. The deal was done and John took the $100,000 he borrowed from Peter and invested it.\n\nAt the end of the year, John made 7 per cent from his own investments and as agreed, paid Peter 4 per cent. Peter became angry with John and insisted that John pay him more, since he had made more with his money. Although this was not the original agreement, John was prepared to change the agreement, but told Peter that in the same way, if he loses money in his investments, in the future, Peter must be prepared to get lesser than 4 per cent or even suffer a capital loss. Peter was very angry. He scolded John for not being trustworthy as getting a guaranteed 4 per cent per annum with no capital loss was what they had agreed on.\n\nBy now, you will understand that I am referring to the interest rates we are getting from our CPF accounts. Our CPF is invested into special issues of Singapore Government Securities (SGS) - otherwise known as Singapore Government Bonds - as they are rated AAA and deemed very safe. These bonds are issued specifically to the Board to meet its interest and other obligations.\n\nThey do not have quoted market values and the Board cannot trade them in the market. The CPF Board currently guarantees that we will get a minimum return of 2.5 per cent per annum for the OA and 4 per cent per annum for the Special Account (SA), Medisave Account (MA) and RA. OA interest is lower because the OA is, in essence, no different from a special-purpose demand deposit - savings are withdrawable on demand primarily for housing.\n\nBy investing it in Special SGS, we are effectively lending our monies to the Singapore government for a guaranteed 2.5 per cent per annum to 4 per cent per annum with very low risk. If the monies are subsequently invested by our government and reaped higher returns, I do not think it is fair for us to demand a higher return for our CPF monies because we cannot ask for a higher return without taking on higher risk.\n\nBut what if one wants to take higher risk and get higher than CPF returns? There is the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS), which allows one to invest his CPF on his own. Why doesn't the CPF Board invest it on our behalf? Because the primary purpose of the CPF is to help us meet our basic retirement needs and therefore the investment objective should be one of capital preservation rather than growth.\n\nOver the past two weeks, plenty of numbers and statistics have been brought up to discredit the CPF and its custodian. But let's not lose sight of its purpose. It is not that numbers are not important. They are, but they exist to serve a purpose, and must be discussed in that context. We can continue to debate on how the current CPF should be improved, but we should never cast doubts on its intentions.\n\nThe writer is the CEO of Providend Ltd, a fee-only independent financial advisory firm\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": []}

Eventually our business model is that the affordable housing provides a very stable, predictable revenue stream every year that you can depend on, but at the same time you have to develop your other revenue streams,\" he added.\n\nNam Long reported after-tax profit of 34.5 billion dong (S$2 million) last year on net revenue of 601.7 billion dong. Margins of about 10 per cent from the company's affordable housing business demonstrate the need to expand into areas which will generate greater shareholder return, said Mr Tran.\n\n\"This is a turning point for the company,\" said Chad Ovel, a Ho Chi Minh City-based partner at Mekong Capital, manager of the Vietnam Azalea Fund, which holds shares in Nam Long. \"They believe they need to diversify, to get away from solely being a developer of one-off properties and to move toward becoming an integrated company, a developer of satellite cities,\" he said.\n\nSatellite cities are becoming an increasingly common urban development concept on the outskirts of South-east Asian cities, such as Phnom Penh in Cambodia, the UK's University of Leeds said in a 2012 paper.\n\nThe development of large-scale housing and satellite cities in areas on the periphery of the inner city is one of the major trends in housing development in Jakarta, many initiated by large developers responding to the potential of the market, Indonesia's Ministry of Housing said in 2009.\n\nNam Long received a US$7.5 million IFC investment this year to finance mid-income homebuyers in Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nThe World Bank unit described the company as a market leader in affordable-housing developments.\n\nPlans for Nam Long's project in Long An include villas, townhouses, apartments, commercial, recreation and service areas, Mr Tran said.\n\n\"The middle class, they want safety, security, a nice area, higher-end,\" said Mr Tran. \"They want gated communities. A country like Vietnam, with a city like Ho Chi Minh City with over 10 million people, the demand is there. You just have to provide the right choice for the buyer,\" he said.\n\n\"Previously they were very focused on marketing their affordable housing business, which is a core business,\" said Mr Ovel.\n\n\"But long term, developing and marketing the large land block they have in Long An will be critical so the story has evolved a bit,\" he added. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

It is next to the the Inglewood landed estate.\n\nCBRE head of Singapore research Desmond Sim estimates the top bid for the plot to be at least $650-$700 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr). Orange-Tee head of research and consultancy Christine Li, however, pegs the site's price, at $720-$745 psf ppr.\n\nMs Li estimates the price of the Kovan site, which is slated for launch in September, at $690-$720 psf ppr while Mr Sim estimates the winning bid to be at least $650-$700 psf ppr.\n\nWhile the site could generate interest due to its proximity to Kovan MRT Station and nearby amenities, argues JLL national director Ong Teck Hui, \"its main drawback is that it is fronting two busy roads - Tampines and Upper Serangoon\".\n\nThe site is estimated to yield about 340 homes.\n\nMs Li also expects good response from developers for the housing site at Jurong West St 41 near Jurong Lake which has been rolled over from the H1 2014 reserve list to the H2 confirmed list. The site is located between The Lakeshore condo and the Lakeville project. She estimates the site's price at $670-$710 psf ppr.\n\nAlso on the favourites list of most consultants are the two commercial and residential sites on the confirmed list: at Yishun Avenue 4 and the Holland Road site, which will form part of the Holland Village Extension plan unveiled in Master Plan 2014.\n\nJLL's Mr Ong noted that these two land parcels are likely to be the most attractive of the sites on the H2 GLS Programme as they \"contain substantial commercial quantum which could provide a positive balance to the residential component, given the challenging residential market\".\n\nThe choicer Holland Road plot is near Holland Village MRT Station while the Yishun site is located in a mature HDB estate, where the surrounding households will provide strong catchment for shops and F&B in the commercial component, Mr Ong added.\n\nOn the reserve list - where sites are released upon successful application by a developer - MND has added a housing site in Dundee Road, next to Queenstown MRT Station and the popular Commonwealth Towers condo which is under construction.\n\nColliers International director Chia Siew Chuin expects the proposed development on the site to attract a potential pool of HDB flat upgraders from Commonwealth, Queenstown and Redhill estates.\n\nNext to Redhill MRT Station, Alexandra View (Parcel A) - which remains on the reserve list - has been rezoned to residential with commercial at the first storey, to allow provision of amenities to serve local residents, MND said.\n\nCBRE's Mr Sim said that the site - which he lists as one of his top picks - would fetch at least $850 psf ppr, taking into account the commercial component.\n\nThe H2 GLS Programme has three executive condo (EC) sites on the confirmed list that can generate a total 1,520 units. There are no EC sites on the reserve list. ECs are a public-private housing hybrid.\n\nThe 1,520-unit EC supply in H2 is 45 per cent lower than the 2,770-unit EC supply in the H1 confirmed and reserve lists. When contacted, a URA spokesman said that among the factors the government considers in planning EC supply are \"market sentiments and the recent refinements to the EC Housing Scheme on Dec 9, 2013, such as the 30 per cent cap on mortgage servicing ratio (MSR) and the resale levy imposed on second-timers\".\n\n\"In addition, 10 EC sites were successfully tendered in 2013 and developers will be launching these for sale in the later part of this year and early next year. The government will continue to monitor the property market closely.\"\n\nThe three confirmed-list EC sites for H2 comprise two new sites located in Anchorvale Crescent and Woodlands Avenue 12 and a plot in Sembawang Road/Canberra Link that is being rolled over from the H1 reserve list.\n\nR'ST Research director Ong Kah Seng noted that EC demand has slowed in the first half of this year. He highlights the launch of Skypark Residences and Waterwoods EC projects in November last year, just before the Dec 9 rule changes. \"From December 2013 to April 2014, sales in Skypark Residences and Waterwoods were mediocre - only 25 units and 56 units respectively.\"\n\nMs Li also highlighted that there were no batched tender exercises in the H2 programme. This refers to tender closings for adjacent sites on the same date in a bid to moderate land prices.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The share transfer book closed on Monday for the purpose of determining shareholders' entitlements to bonus shares.\n\nMr Luong sold about seven million shares between March and April this year despite strong financial performance in the past few quarters, said OSK DMG analyst Edison Chen. \"Perhaps what is most alarming is his recent sale of 13 million UMS shares in the open market at an average of 69 cents per share,\" said Mr Chen.\n\nRepresentatives of UMS said Mr Luong is currently overseas and cannot be reached for comment. Within this year, his stake has dropped from 27.8 per cent to 22 per cent currently.\n\nIn addition, UMS's single largest customer Applied Materials sold 2.92 million shares this month at an average price of 70 cents apiece.\n\nAccording to OSK DMG, Applied Materials, which manufactures semiconductors, display and solar photovoltaic equipment, accounted for 80-90 per cent of UMS's FY13 revenue. It has ceased to be a substantial shareholder as its stake in the company has dropped from 6 per cent before to below 5 per cent.\n\nUMS, which manufactures front-end semiconductor components, may also take a hit in terms of revenue. Channel checks show that the component supply chain in the industry is facing downward pricing pressure, said Mr Chen.\n\nAlong with \"negative signs\" from the sale of shares by UMS's founder and the largest customer, OSK DMG believes the company's profitability may not be sustainable in the year ahead.\n\nUMS has reported increases in net profit from the previous year in the last four quarters. The company posted a first-quarter net profit of $8.6 million, a 63 per cent jump from a year ago on higher component sales. It announced a dividend of one cent per share in the first quarter.\n\n\"Despite UMS's robust cash flow and dividends, the unexpected sale of its shares by key stakeholders and its lack of customer diversification has cast a pall over its outlook,\" said Mr Chen.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Now Free,\" it announced.\n\nSaving a speck of time and trouble, Mr Parker tapped directly into the service offered by the airport, where travellers without their own Wi-Fi alternative had paid US$4.95 per day.\n\nThe roll call of free arrangements - entirely at some airports, in combination with premium-paid levels at others - is growing, both domestically and abroad. As airlines tack on fees for ever-fading courtesies, from checked baggage to advance seat selection, airports are headed in the opposite philosophical direction when it comes to Wi-Fi.\n\nOf the nation's 30 busiest airports, 12 offer all-free Internet, up from nine in 2007, according to Boingo Wireless, a leading provider of airport wireless services. A dozen others opt for a tiered plan, with some free access. The shift is also playing out at smaller locations, where the financial and operational challenges are less daunting.\n\nFor much of society, free Wi-Fi has evolved into something of a right, and the trend at airports is to treat it as an amenity no different from water fountains and push carts.\n\nHartsfield-Jackson's general manager, Miguel Southwell, says an airport's purpose extends beyond transporting sky-minded passengers to \"being a catalyst for economic development\". A pleasant experience for travellers, which can include free Wi-Fi, could spawn fresh or expanded businesses.\n\n\"We want to exceed customer expectations,\" Mr Southwell said.\n\nThe fee-based format had generated waves of dissatisfaction. Consumer surveys found that a third of Hartsfield-Jackson's travellers identified the absence of free Wi-Fi as their primary complaint by a wide margin.\n\nThe switch comes at a steep initial price. Gone is US$1.5 million in annual revenue from the pay service, along with US$5.6 million appropriated by the Atlanta City Council to cover the design, equipment and installation.\n\nMayor Kasim Reed, who trumpeted the change-over at a news conference, voiced confidence that some lost revenue would be recouped through more spending at airport establishments. For now, users will be spared online advertising, but such mild annoyances, at least in the form of discount coupons at restaurants and stores, seem inevitable.\n\nSome Wi-Fi regulars embrace the free service more to avoid the hassles than the cost. Airports that levy a fee require a credit card number and other information to be entered, as opposed to a couple of clicks with the no-charge approach.\n\n\"Passengers want to be able to select a network and go, not hunt to find the right set of options and buttons to click on,\" said Seth Miller, an aviation analyst and blogger who is based in New York.\n\nBut because the customer load for free Wi-Fi is as much as 10 times that for the pay version, speeds can become agonisingly slow at times. The bump in bandwidth consumption, and thus sluggishness, is even greater as passengers stream audio and videos.\n\nThrow in ads, and \"it can be almost so commercial and such a poor connection, it's almost not worth logging on\", some analysts said.\n\nAt Hartsfield-Jackson, patrons have been promised no dropped connections. The system can accommodate 15,000 connections simultaneously because of considerably more access points, a significant upgrade from the 2,000 maximum with the fee design.\n\n\"Travellers are becoming more vocal in their demands, not only for connectivity but for it to be good service,\" Mr Miller said. \"And they're not shy about telling the world when they don't get it.\" - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

A pre-trial conference for this case has been fixed for Aug 1.\n\nThe Foreign Affairs Ministry and the Home Affairs Ministry said in a joint statement that Singapore in January received information that the firm had been implicated in the shipment of arms and related material bound for North Korea from Cuba. The alleged shipment was interdicted by Panama in July last year.\n\nThe ministries added: \"As a responsible member of the international community, Singapore has given full effect in our domestic legislation to the measures prescribed by United Nations Security Council resolutions and will take action against any individuals and/or companies that flout these.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But they're not, at least for those who believe that this is as bad as it gets for the counters that are trading at uber-low levels. As it turns out, this is the prevailing mindset among market participants.\n\nIf this upswing in penny stocks persists, June could very well be the month when punters' romance with these penny stocks, after they hit lows barely a month ago, rebounded. Otherwise, it would just be a blip in some punters' piped dream.\n\nBlumont shares have more than doubled in the first seven days of trading in June, jumping from three cents to yesterday's close of 6.4 cents.\n\nAsiasons shares leapt more than 45 per cent, or 2.2 cents, to seven cents yesterday, while goldminer LionGold surged 17 per cent, or 1.5 cents, to 10.2 cents.\n\nStill, the counters are nowhere close to their giddy peaks of $2.45 for Blumont, $1.725 for LionGold and $2.83 for Asiasons.\n\nThe recovery, on hearty trading volumes, is infectious. Other linked counters, too, are on the rise.\n\nInnopac has risen 75 per cent or 0.9 cent over the same period to 2.1 cents. The rest of the gang, namely Ipco International, Magnus Energy and Annica Holdings, have also gained ground to varying degrees.\n\nYet recent corporate developments at the firms hardly justify the rise in these counters.\n\nThe three firms at the heart of the penny-stock saga have all suffered big losses for the January-March quarter.\n\nBlumont swung to a $5.7 million loss for its first quarter, from a profit of $31 million a year ago. Asiasons sank to a Q1 loss of $1.3 billion from a profit of $1.8 billion a year ago, while LionGold, after issuing a profit warning, saw its Q4 losses balloon to $89 million from $2.7 million.\n\nInnopac Holdings issued a profit warning, saying it will report a bigger loss of $34 million in its audited accounts for the year ended December 2013 owing to an additional provision for a derivative receivable transaction. The firm will release its financial statement on or by tomorrow.\n\nThe penny stock play is taking place against a better showing by the Straits Times Index, which on Monday breached the 3,300 level. With that, the once-undervalued benchmark has inched closer to global average earnings multiples of 15-16.\n\nA possible reason for the gains in the shares of the three firms, where good news has long been elusive, could be that the stocks seem to be irresistibly cheap. At next to ground-zero prices, how much lower can they be expected to fall?\n\nThen there are those who were burnt by the penny-stock collapse that saw billions wiped off the market value of these counters who may be looking to average down their investment cost.\n\nBefore the stocks were whiplashed last October, investors had piled on the shares of the trio, lured by their great upside as the firms made big moves in the resource space. But the counters crashed in spectacular fashion, the cause of which is now subject to a probe.\n\nThese days, the investing mantra surrounding these stocks is \"how low can they go\".\n\nWho wouldn't want to brag that they had the foresight - and gumption - to scoop up OSIM International shares at five cents back in 2009 and just about a year later gleefully witness that their price had jumped more than 20 times?\n\nPerhaps it's worth bearing in mind that limited downside does not necessarily mean better upside. A stock, devoid of fundamental drivers, can be stuck at basement levels for years. There's more to a stock than its price.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Two were charged with fleeing and abandoning ship that carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.

This collaboration will also fortify YCH's presence along China's coastline, reinforcing its key hubs such as Tianjin and Shanghai for enhanced freight connectivity and network optimisation.\"\n\nYCH's head of China, Roger Yap, added, in response to queries from The Business Times, that he believed there were opportunities in manufacturing logistics and in consumer and distribution fulfilment in Qingdao; he said the company is also looking into the potential of doing more freight and forwarding through Qingdao.\n\nThe signing of the MOU was witnessed by Qingdao's Bureau of Commerce director Ma Weigang and International Enterprise (IE) Singapore's group director of China Law Chung Ming.\n\nIE Singapore had organised a business mission to three major cities in Shandong earlier this year, aimed at helping Singapore companies expand into China. The mission followed up on the pledge by the Singapore-Shandong Business Council (SSBC) to deepen Singapore-Shandong economic ties, a commitment agreed upon at the 17th SSBC meeting in Singapore last September.\n\nYCH, set up in 1955, has been in China since the mid-1990s. It has since built a comprehensive logistics network there, with a presence in Tianjin, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Kunshan, Xiamen, Chengdu, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Macau and Hong Kong, servicing multinational companies such as Dell, Ferrero, ExxonMobil, Carrefour and Samsung.\n\nMr Roger Yap told BT that while YCH works with QDIS in Qingdao, it will not let up on its efforts to strengthen its offerings through City Supply Chain in other consumption-driven cities such as Guangzhou - where it collaborates with the state-owned Guangzhou Transportation Group - Chengdu, Tianjin and Shanghai.\n\n\"Plans to enter new markets beyond our current network in China will largely depend on customers' needs and other strategic corporate development initiatives,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The accord, which took effect on Jan 20, was designed to buy time for a final deal within six months and allows for the sale of aircraft parts.\n\nAsked if it would be easier to do business in future with companies that had cooperated under the temporary Geneva deal, Mr Parvaresh told Reuters: \"Yes, that is for sure.\"\n\nHe added: \"To my understanding, if sanctions are lifted in aviation, we would need at least 100 aircraft right away, both wide-body and narrow-body.\"\n\nUS companies Boeing and General Electric have said that they are seeking to export parts to Iran under the agreement for sanctions relief which expires on July 20.\n\nMr Parvaresh said that Europe's Airbus Group was also working with Iran under the temporary agreement. A spokesman for Airbus, which has previously only said that it was considering this, confirmed it had asked Washington for a spares export licence.\n\nMr Parvaresh listed Western models which he said would fit the airline's networks, including the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737-800 narrow-body jets, and wide-body long-haul jets such as the A330 and A350, 777 and 787 and \"maybe\" the 747-8.\n\nHe also cited Canada's Bombardier and Brazil's Embraer, two companies challenging for a slice of the US$100 billion annual market for jetliners. \"We can work with all of them,\" he said. \"Even if the aircraft are not available immediately, we can easily lease.\"\n\nHe confirmed estimates that Iran would ultimately need as many as 400 aircraft and said that its strategy would be to compete with the fast-growing hubs of Gulf carriers.\n\nAsked if Iran Air was already talking to planemakers about its needs in case sanctions are lifted, Mr Parvaresh said: \"We are in contact with many aircraft manufacturers.

It comes at a cost: swelling borrowing that's threatening local-government finances.\n\nTang Chunmei, a 43-year-old real estate agent in Chenjia Town, 45km from China's financial hub, said average apartment prices may rise 35 per cent in seven years. That contrasts with cooling nationwide, as home prices fell 0.3 per cent in May in the first monthly drop since June 2012. Chenjia financed its expansion in part with an 800 million yuan (S$160 million) bond sold through a financing unit last year, exceeding the town's 120 million yuan of fiscal revenue, to build affordable apartments for farmers as rice fields are turned into tourist attractions.\n\n\"We've been so busy we can't even take days off on holidays,\" said Ms Tang, who now lives and works in a neighbourhood whose name means wealthy and grand, after relocating from a rural house nearby two years ago. \"I don't know if I'm concerned about the local-government debt. Life is better than before.\"\n\nPremier Li Keqiang must balance plans to build 36 million new homes for families such as Ms Tang's, as he champions urbanisation to spur economic growth, with steps to rein in local liabilities that have swelled to 17.9 trillion yuan. Debt in counties such as Chongming, which includes the island where Chenjia is located at the mouth of the Yangtze River, soared 77 per cent through the end of June last year from December 2010, outpacing the 62 per cent increase for provinces, according to audit bureau data.\n\nAn official at Chenjia's local-government financing vehicle, who asked not to be identified, declined to comment on the source of funds for debt repayment. A press official at Chongming County also declined to comment.\n\n\"There's a mismatch between local government revenue and resources, which is particularly conspicuous on the county level,\" said David Cui, China strategist at Bank of America Corp. \"There will be problems in the future for many local governments that borrowed heavily without adequate fiscal revenue.\"\n\nRegional authorities in the world's second-largest economy established more than 10,000 so-called local government financing vehicles (LGFVs) to fund construction projects after they were barred from directly issuing bonds under a 1994 budget law. Local governments are responsible for 80 per cent of spending, while getting only about 40 per cent of tax revenue, the legacy of a 1994 tax-sharing system, the World Bank said.\n\nMs Tang in Chenjia said the debt-fuelled development in the town where she grew up has brought benefits. Her family gave up their one mu (0.6 hectare) of farmland and two-storey house in return for three separate apartments and hukou, the urban household registrations that give access to perks including healthcare and pensions.\n\nA former housewife, Ms Tang got her job at the real estate company after the move. She now earns as much as 60,000 yuan a year, three times the salary for a factory worker on Chongming Island, she said.\n\n\"The apartment is cleaner without all those agricultural tools,\" said Ms Tang, standing in her 114.5 square-metre three-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, on which she spent 120,000 yuan decorating.\n\nFarmers-turned-urban dwellers can put the apartments on sale three years after the ownership certificate is issued. Most buyers are Shanghai residents, Ms Tang said.\n\nOn the south side of town, wealthy people from Shanghai are buying villas along the coast as investments or vacation homes, according to Zhu Ana, a saleswoman at Boee Real Estate, a Zhejiang-based developer. The company built Tuscan-style villas priced up to 16 million yuan in the area, which also has a five- star hotel, the Hyatt Regency.\n\nSecond-hand housing prices in Chongming Island have climbed more than those in Shanghai every month this year, rising 19.8 per cent in May compared with 15.8 per cent in the financial hub, according to data compiled by Anjuke, a Shanghai-based property-listings site. In contrast, home prices nationwide dropped 0.3 per cent from April, according to SouFun Holdings Ltd, the country's biggest real estate website owner.\n\nAs the market slumps elsewhere, Chenjia aims to more than triple its population to 210,000 by 2020, according to a brochure provided by the LGFV. Planned projects include a conference venue, polo club, theme park and marina. That's all coming at a cost. Debt at Chenjia's LGFV climbed to 6.6 billion yuan at the end of 2012, compared with 5.0 billion yuan in 2010, according to the bond prospectus. It estimates 2.84 million yuan of profit from the affordable housing project and 99 million yuan from store leases, while it gets 400 million yuan in subsidies from the central and the municipal governments, according to the filing.\n\nPressure to refinance old borrowings is forcing China's LGFVs to issue a record amount of bonds this year. They sold 966.3 billion yuan of notes in 2014, the most in the same period since at least 2002, according to data compiled by Bloomberg on 2,450 so-called chengtou bonds issued by the financing units.\n\nChenjia's debt-financed development hasn't pleased everybody.\n\n\"Relocation's not necessarily a good thing,\" said Wang Kai, a 42-year-old taxi driver who works in Shanghai. \"Prices go up when you move to the new neighbourhood. Vegetable markets are more expensive. Old people in particular have nothing to do.\"\n\nInvestors should exercise caution and consider the long-term viability of Chenjia's development model, according to Hu Yifan, the Hong Kong-based chief economist at Haitong International Securities Group Ltd.\n\n\"The current price rise in Chenjia could be a short-term phenomenon given shrinking housing sales volume and falling sales prices nationwide,\" Ms Hu said. \"Another concern is that the kind of LGFV bonds issued in Chenjia lack sufficient transparency.\"\n\nChina will let some local governments repay notes themselves this year in an expansion of a municipal debt trial, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement on May 21.\n\n\"Developing the muni market is a positive step because it should entail greater disclosure to investors,\" Ms Hu said.\n\nThe People's Bank of China said on May 6 it will strengthen monitoring of credit extended to LGFVs, real estate companies and industries with overcapacity. Premier Li has spoken of fine-tuning policy as he juggles curbing excessive lending with steps to meet a 7.5 per cent economic growth target this year. The government in early April rolled out tax breaks and sped up spending on infrastructure and social housing.\n\nChongming's economic output grew 6.8 per cent in 2013, according to figures posted by Shanghai Statistics Bureau on its website, lagging the 7.7 per cent national growth.\n\nLu Haitao, a 35-year-old Chenjia-native who comes back to stay with family on days off from work in Shanghai, said the urbanisation has increased opportunities even though there's room for improvement in expanding options beyond blue-collar jobs.\n\n\"It's good we're moving forward,\" said Mr Lu, who was playing badminton in the neighbourhood's cultural centre. \"It's good we no longer need to grow our own rice.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM\n\nUK homebuyer demand rebounds to a six-month high, index shows\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:30 AM", "images": []}

Prime Minister John Key wants to double both numbers by 2018.\n\nFacing a September election, Mr Key is seeking to boost tourism, skilled services and manufacturing to diversify an economy reliant on dairy exports and squeezed by an elevated currency. Part of the effort is aimed at reversing a slump in boat building and fitting in the wake of the global financial crisis and luring more super rich to New Zealand's shores.\n\n\"Their spend per person is significantly different from any other tourists,\" said Murray McCaw, co-owner of the Bay of Many Coves resort in the Marlborough Sounds, whose intricate waterways, islands and secluded beaches are promoted as a boaters' paradise. \"That high-yielding tourist is a really important part of the international tourism economy for New Zealand.\"\n\nMarlborough Sounds, at the top of the nation's South Island, is a popular destination for superyachts, which can anchor in its sheltered bays. Those who visit Mr McCaw's resort book tables at the Foredeck restaurant to dine on local scallops and kingfish, and hire spa therapists for a hot stone massage or a facial treatment on board, he said.\n\n\"While they are moored here, they might also go to another lodge or a vineyard, where they can sample award-winning sauvignon blanc wines the Marlborough region is known for,\" Mr McCaw said. \"They're not just sitting there biding their time in the sunshine. These people are about the experience.\"\n\nGovernment tourism and trade promotion agencies have joined the boat-building industry to market New Zealand as a destination for superyachts, citing the opportunities to explore 15,000 km of coast and the scope to have their vessels refitted in the nation's shipyards. Spending in the tourism industry makes up about 8.7 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), according to government figures.\n\nRepair and refit has become a key focus for the marine industry as orders for new boats slowed after the financial crisis. Local boat builders have a global reputation for workmanship, enhanced by a list of industry awards and the 2013 America's Cup, when New Zealand's contender was narrowly beaten by Larry Ellison's Oracle, a yacht that also relied on New Zealand design and construction.\n\nThe \"double whammy\" of fewer orders and the New Zealand dollar's 26 per cent gain in the past four years have made it tough, said Tony Hambrook, chief executive officer of Auckland-based Alloy Yachts, which won its category at the 2014 World Super Yacht Awards for the 128 foot motorboat CaryAli.\n\nRival shipyards in Europe \"have sharpened their pencils dramatically and reduced their margins\", said Mr Hambrook, who has cut his workforce to 212 from about 450 in 2011.\n\nAlloy is being urged to do more repair and refit work by the owners of boats that it has built, and is in talks to open a facility in Auckland's harbour that has the necessary deep-water access, Mr Hambrook said.\n\nMr Melnichenko's superyacht A - named after his wife Aleksandra - arrived in Auckland in September for maintenance before the owners and their pet flew in on March 10.\n\nNew Zealand's Ministry for Primary Industries approved the yacht as a transitional quarantine facility and deployed a vet to stay on board for the 10-day containment period, using its discretion to allow for special arrangements. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

It has invested an estimated C$12.5 billion in Asia since 1991. Of this, public markets account for about 65 per cent.\n\nSaid OTPP chief executive Ron Mock: \"We've been investing in Asia for a very long time . . . We believe it's a critically important part of our portfolio growth in the future.\"\n\nHe added: \"We're Asian optimists. We see this region as a place that we absolutely have to be involved in. The private area is in a growth mode for us.\n\n\"We're value investors; our style is always to look from the bottom up . . . (Investments in Asia) will accelerate pretty much on the private front. But it's not going to be thematic; it will be one opportunity at a time as we work with partners to find opportunities.\"\n\nIn Singapore, the fund has invested \"substantial amounts\" in hedge funds.\n\nOTPP set up an office in Hong Kong about six months ago to serve as a base to suss out opportunities and deepen partnerships in the region.\n\nFor instance, it has in the past worked with Temasek Holdings and the Government of Singapore Investment Corp (GIC), said Mr Mock, and it is keen to do so in the future, particularly on private deals.\n\n\"It's always private equity or transactions but I can't go into details. Through the years we've had relations with both and they're very professional and good to deal with.\"\n\nHe added: \"The unique opportunities come from our partnerships. Those are really important in the current market where central banks run very loose monetary policies. Rates are extremely low and asset prices very high. What we therefore need is to find unique private opportunities.\"\n\nThe OTPP invests its assets for the benefit of 307,000 active and retired elementary and secondary school teachers and their survivors.\n\nAt end-2013, about 49 per cent of the fund was invested in equities, 41 per cent in fixed income and 22 per cent in real assets. Commodities and absolute return strategies have an allocation of 8 per cent each.\n\nIn 2013, the fund reported returns of 10.9 per cent. It also reported a C$5.1 billion surplus, based on current benefit levels and contribution rates.\n\nSince inception, the fund has generated annualised returns of 10.2 per cent, compared with its benchmark return of 8 per cent.\n\nMr Mock, who became president and CEO in January, said OTPP is a long-term investor. \"We have to generate retirement income for generations. What this requires is a very long view. Markets may go up and down within a one- or two-year period. But over a decade or two we have to be satisfied with the growth and opportunities we find in each country.\"\n\nThe experience of the 2008 crisis renewed its focus on cash management and the management of counterparty credit risk. Sophisticated cash management helps to ensure that there is capital to take advantage of market opportunities. \"In 2008 we were able to deploy C$5 billion into certain markets quite opportunistically that today have yielded fantastic dividends for us. In a crisis we will tend to move into the fire rather than run away,\" Mr Mock explained.\n\nHigher interest rates are not necessarily a bad thing for the pension fund despite its significant fixed income allocation. This is because higher interest rates will result in a lower valuation of its liabilities, thanks to the use of a higher discount rate. Discount rates are typically linked to bond yields.\n\nLower rates have the opposite effect. Mr Mock said that every 100 basis point fall in rates causes OTPP liabilities to rise by C$35 billion.\n\nFixed income, he pointed out, satisfies three objectives. One is to act as a balancer or stabiliser against equities. When equities fall substantially, bond prices typically rise. A second objective is to serve as a balancer for liabilities. A third objective is to generate cash flow to pay pensioners.\n\n\"Now that we've hit a 100-year low in rates, we started moving a year ago to have less rate exposure, which was a nice move. As rates go up, our liabilities come down. So rising rates are good for us because our liabilities are lower,\" Mr Mock added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

More financial transactions can now be done cheaper and faster than before and, to an increasing degree, automatically.\n\nThis has already played out on Wall Street, where analysts believe the fresh round of job cuts this year reflects the shift from branch to mobile banking, Mr Tharman said.\n\nIt will change the profile of jobs in the global finance sector too.\n\n\"We saw an earlier wave of this during the IT revolution of the 1990s, when many typing and clerical jobs, and those in switchboard operations and routine production lines were lost,\" he said. \"In the next wave, experts now foresee many more white-collar jobs at risk globally.\"\n\nIn the midst of these changes, though, Asian finance is still expected to grow for at least another two decades, Mr Tharman said, pointing to the increasing trade flows and wealth creation in this region.\n\nTo that end, he said there is demand for specialists in areas such as structured trade finance and risk management. Mr Tharman also saw knowledge of the region as an essential skill, and said Singaporeans in the financial sector should be supported in building this expertise.\n\n\"Cross-border solutions and transactions are increasingly the norm in the business,\" he said. \"It also enables financial institutions to manage their risks well, and operate effectively in Asia's still diverse regulatory frameworks and market environments.\"\n\nGlobal banks with a Singapore presence such as Citi and Standard Chartered said they are encouraging Singaporeans to head overseas to gain experience.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And as long-term expats move to newer condos, older properties are also coming to the market for tenants. So vacancies are also rising.\"\n\nOne reason some investors are keeping their units in newly completed projects empty is that they intend to sell the property to realise the nice capital appreciation they may be sitting on.\n\nIn that case, it may be easier to keep the unit vacant in the interim, since this will facilitate viewings for potential buyers. Also, potential buyers keen on occupying the unit may not like a property with an ongoing lease that has some way to run.\n\n\"Of course, the flipside to keeping the unit empty, would be that the owner may not be aware of any defects that he could get rectified for free by the developer during the one-year defects liability period. Moreover, a new property that is left empty deteriorates faster than one that's well-used,\" said Mr Ku.\n\n\"So my advice is that such owners either quickly find a tenant by probably giving some discount on the rent, or lower their capital appreciation expectation and sell the property,\" he added.\n\nOng Teck Hui, national director at Jones Lang LaSalle, noted that during the run-up in the residential market in the past four years, many investors were attracted by affordable prices - referring to the trend of developers minting smaller units to keep absolute prices within buyers' reach - without considering sufficiently, how well the unit would lease, especially in a tough leasing market.\n\n\"For example, suburban units without strong attributes such as proximity to MRT station and amenities tend to be more vulnerable, so buyers should carefully consider all the leasing factors and not be taken in by lump-sum price affordability,\" he advised.\n\nR'ST Research director Ong Kah Seng advised investors holding on to completed suburban condos, especially small units that are more difficult to lease out, to consider selling the property instead of leaving it empty.\n\n\"Suburban condo projects usually don't have unique designs and thus have little intrinsic resale value that can be extracted in the longer run. A consistently untenanted property may not make financial sums viable for such owners in the long term,\" he said.\n\nAs for those thinking of buying a private residential property for rental income, DTZ's regional head (SEA) research Lee Lay Keng lists some general tips on the desirable property attributes: Pick a property in an accessible location but ensure that it is not near major construction works as the noise pollution and road congestion may put off tenants. In addition, the property should be well-maintained and near schools (for renting to families).\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

typically around 40 per cent of the property's value - which is then refunded in its entirety, or renewed, after two years.\n\nAt its peak in the mid-1990s, two-thirds of all housing rents and leases in South Korea were using the jeonse system.\n\nThe benefit for landlords was a large capital sum they could invest in high-yield opportunities that were plentiful during the country's rapid industrialisation in the 1970s and 80s, when banks often offered double-digit interest rates.\n\nThose investment opportunities included financing second or third properties purchased as a speculative investment on the back of fast-rising housing prices.\n\nLandlords could return the deposit at the end of a contract and keep profits, or find a replacement jeonse tenant who effectively pays the deposit of the departing tenant when their contract begins.\n\nThe system was also a boon for first-time home buyers at a time when mortgages were hard to come by because of government policies that pushed banks to lend to manufacturing firms at the heart of the country's export-driven growth model.\n\nTypically, a property occupied by a jeonse tenant was traded at a price excluding the up-front deposit.\n\nSo buyers could get a home at the fraction of its cost, although they would eventually have to pay the departing tenant's deposit before taking up residence themselves.\n\n\"Essentially, the jeonse deposit played the role of a bank loan, which the home buyers could pay back in the future when they amassed enough savings and were ready to actually move in,\" said Kwon Joo-An, analyst at Seoul-based Korea Housing Institute.\n\nBut some didn't bother to move in.\n\nSpeculators would snap up several jeonse-leased houses at discount prices and then sell them at a huge profit, riding on and further fanning a real estate price surge.\n\nIn 1978, property prices soared 49 per cent across the country, 79 per cent in six main cities and a stunning 136 per cent in the capital Seoul alone.\n\n\"Back then, jeonse was also a popular way to increase personal wealth,\" said Mr Kwon. \"That's what sustained the jeonse system for decades - the belief that property prices would just keep rising.\"\n\nSpeculation and property price inflation became a major challenge for policymakers, and successive administrations introduced measures to cool things down, but to limited effect.\n\nIn the end, it was brought to heel by changing market conditions brought about by a multitude of socio-economic factors - ranging from an ageing population to the global slowdown.\n\nSince 2008, both interest rates and property prices have fallen - seriously undermining the twin foundations that sustained the jeonse system.\n\nThe low rates negatively impact a key benefit for the landlord - investing the jeonse capital sum at a high-level of return.\n\nWith investment opportunities limited, landlords began switching from an under-performing jeonse to a monthly rental system more familiar to the rest of the world.\n\nRentals accounted for around 30 per cent of leases in 1995, but that share had risen to 50 per cent by 2010, and is believed to have increased further in the years since then.\n\nThe jeonse share of leases dropped by a corresponding amount from 67 per cent in 1995 to 50 per cent in 2010.\n\nAt the same time, existing jeonse tenants with enough savings to buy their own homes have been holding off in the hope that property prices will continue to fall.\n\nThis, coupled with the switch to monthly rentals, has resulted in a dearth of new jeonse contracts with demand far outstripping supply, and the jeonse deposit demanded by landlords has skyrocketed.\n\nThe average up-front jeonse payment now stands at more than 65 per cent of the property's value - compared to 42 per cent in 2008 - and in some cases it has gone as high as 90 per cent.\n\n\"I don't think the jeonse system will disappear, but in the long run more landlords are going to demand monthly payments, pushing jeonse out,\" Mr Kwon said.\n\nThis is a disaster for people like June Lee, a 27-year-old office worker who plans to marry later this year.\n\nMs Lee and her fianc\u00e9 believed the 100 million won (S$123,111) they had saved would secure them a jeonse rental on an 80 square metre relatively new apartment on the outskirts of Seoul.\n\n\"But now the landlords are either asking for a ridiculously huge deposit or they want monthly rent,\" Ms Lee said.\n\n\"How are we going to save money if we have to waste so much on the rent every month?\" she added.\n\nSon Jae-Young, a professor of real estate studies at Konkuk University in Seoul, said the jeonse system had reinforced the widely held view that monthly payments were tantamount to throwing money away.\n\n\"Obviously, it cuts disposable income and savings ... making it even harder to buy a home later,\" he pointed out.\n\nHousing prices were driven so high during the boom years that, even though they have fallen significantly, they remain out of the reach of many young South Koreans. -

The low-cost carrier is set to take delivery of its first Dreamliner, even as it seeks to build a stronger alliance with budget carrier Tigerair at home and spreads its wings overseas with its first joint venture NokScoot.\n\nFully owned by Singapore Airlines (SIA), Scoot took to the skies in June 2012 in a move widely seen as SIA's efforts to claw back ground lost over the years to budget carriers such as Jetstar Asia and AirAsia.\n\nSince its inception, Scoot's load factors have stayed above the 80 per cent threshold with the airline carrying its two millionth passenger in January this year.\n\nYields, however, are tougher to maintain, as is the case for many airlines these days. \"It's certainly challenging, partly because we're still in the launch phase for a number of our routes. Many of them, we've only been flying for 12 months,\" said Scoot chief executive Campbell Wilson, who was with the SIA group before taking the helm at the budget carrier\n\nIn Australia, competition is stiff, while the depreciation of the Australian dollar hasn't helped matters. Meanwhile, demand for flights to Bangkok have fallen as Thailand's capital continues to experience political turmoil.\n\nFalling traffic\n\nChangi Airport has also felt the heat of regional political tensions, with passengers handled up just 1.7 per cent year on year to 17.58 million for the four months spanning January to April. For the month of April, Thailand and China traffic fell 15 per cent and 8 per cent respectively, said airport operator Changi Airport Group (CAG).\n\nTravel has declined out of certain Chinese markets in the wake of the disappearance of flight MH370. Singapore, a destination often done together with Malaysia and Thailand, is taking a hit as a result.\n\n\"But the other markets are performing quite well,\" Mr Wilson added.\n\nSIA has yet to release figures on Scoot's financial performance.\n\nScoot currently operates a fleet of six wide-body Boeing 777-200s to 12 destinations besides Singapore - namely markets such as China, Australia, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan and South Korea.\n\nBut come November, it will transition to the Dreamliner by receiving the first of 20 Boeing 787 aircraft that were initially ordered by SIA.\n\nLast month, SIA announced that it was buying 400 million shares in Scoot for $400 million, which will help fund the acquisition of Scoot's Dreamliners, due to come in a mix of 8 and 9 variants.\n\nBy end-March 2015, Scoot would have received two Dreamliners, and a total of six new planes by August next year. These will be used to phase out its existing 402-seater 777 aircraft, enabling it to eke out greater efficiencies with the next-generation plane.\n\nBy end-March 2016, Scoot will have 11 787s - which will facilitate frequency increases and network expansion - and a fleet of 20 by 2019.\n\nFuel burn per seat is expected come down 20-25 per cent with the Dreamliner, which is substantial given that some 50 per cent of Scoot's costs come from fuel.\n\nFurther growth of its network is expected by the middle of next year, although the carrier is likely to stick to its sweet spot of a five to nine hour flight radius.\n\nAnother key development - although this is contingent on approvals from the Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) - is the further deepening of Scoot and SIA-backed Tigerair's partnership.\n\nEarlier this year, the two carriers applied to the CSS for the green light to work together on areas such as scheduling, pricing as well as sales and marketing, and are awaiting a decision.\n\nFor passengers, this would mean the ability to tap services by both carriers, such as flying up to a destination on one carrier and back on the other. Better scheduling between the two carriers would be a boost for transit passengers as they could select more compatible flights, which in turn could attract more transit passengers to Changi Airport.\n\nScoot, for instance, could deploy its bigger aircraft on slots with heavier volumes, given that Tigerair operates smaller, single-aisle planes.\n\nPlus, with strong transit feed, the airlines would be less reliant on traffic originating from Singapore which may spur more services, enabling costs to come down. This can then be passed on to consumers in the form of lower fares.\n\nIn a recent report, CAPA - Centre for Aviation highlighted that budget carrier AirAsia X has been driving transit traffic through Kuala Lumpur International Airport onto other AirAsia Group flights - a model that Changi, Tigerair and Scoot would do well to replicate. CAPA noted that while Scoot and Tigerair are already offering joint itineraries, this has yet to yield significant transfer traffic.\n\nJoint venture\n\nMeanwhile, Scoot is also working on setting up a joint venture with Thailand's Nok Air which will operate medium/long haul services using the 777. NokScoot, as it is known, will operate out of Bangkok's Don Muang airport, where Nok operates and where capacity is less constrained vis-a-vis Suvarnabhumi International.\n\nThe new carrier is slated to launch in the second half of this year, although the launch date may hinge on regulatory approvals and the political climate.\n\nNorth Asia is the first market that NokScoot will serve, with the aim of getting travellers down to Bangkok, which Scoot already operates to. This would enable Scoot to bring travellers from Bangkok to Singapore as well as down to Australia, and vice versa.\n\n\"It allows us to serve cities that we couldn't otherwise serve from Singapore simply because there isn't the volume of traffic, so in that respect Bangkok does give us an opening to other markets that are not viable for Scoot,\" Mr Wilson added.\n\nWith two years under its belt, Scoot will now work on ensuring the carrier continues to keep operational standards stable as well as filling seats and improving yields.\n\nOther \"nice add-ons\" which were not immediate priorities when the fledging carrier was launched are also in the works, such as a mobile app and Web check-in.\n\nAnd with its fleet set to roughly double by March 2016, work is already underway to begin charting its expanding network.\n\n\"The planning for that already has started,\" Mr Wilson said.\n\nnishar@sph.com.sg\n\n@Nisha_BT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Sales volume will improve in the second half of the year and rise 10 per cent for the full year, boosted by price cuts, according to the report.\n\n\"Prices are likely to continue to slide because of large inventory in some markets,\" Hong Kong-based analysts, led by Bei Fu, wrote in the report. \"Many small unrated developers will feel the heat the most because their sales and financing capacities are substantially weaker than their larger peers'. Some lower-tier cities with limited demand and abundant supply could see deeper downward price adjustments.\"\n\nThe pressure on Chinese developers was underscored by the collapse of a builder in a city south of Shanghai in March. After four years of government restrictions to cool the housing market, home sales and property construction are sliding and have become a drag on the economy, which recorded its slowest growth in six quarters in the first three months of the year.\n\nHome prices fell 0.3 per cent in May from April, the first monthly drop since June 2012, according to SouFun Holdings Ltd, China's biggest real estate website owner.\n\nDevelopers set a target 20 per cent higher than their average 2013 sales and achieved only 27 per cent of it in the first four months, according to S&P, which tracks 27 developers.\n\n\"We expect most large national players to be able to weather the market correction ahead,\" Mr Fu said. \"Among the rated developers, companies with more aggressive debt-funded growth appetite or weak execution ability will face downgrade risks.\" Moody's Investors Service revised its credit outlook for Chinese developers to \"negative\" from \"stable\" last month. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

The plans emphasise state-sponsored infrastructure spending and limit the role of foreign capital. Both sides have said that they will maintain the mineral ore export ban and steep taxes on overseas cargoes, even as some of the country's biggest mining companies say that they are suspending operations as the measure violates their contracts.\n\nNewmont Mining Corp last week declared force majeur because of export taxes on copper concentrate that will ratchet up from 25 per cent to 60 per cent by 2016, allowing it to back out of supply contracts.\n\nHopes abound that after the campaign, the winner will back away from the nationalistic rhetoric and adopt more pragmatic views as foreign direct investment dries up, making it tougher to fund yawning current and fiscal deficits.\n\n\"There's no upside to backing away from populism for either candidate,\" said a senior investment banker attending a speech by Mr Prabowo's chief economic adviser and brother, Hashim Djojohadikusumo, in Jakarta.\n\n\"Cooler heads will prevail after the elections,\" the banker said, asking for anonymity because his bank doesn't allow him to speak to the media.\n\nIn April, Mr Yudhoyono ordered some 100 trillion rupiah (S$10.62 billion) from the central government to offset the surging cost of fuel subsidies.\n\nFailure to act will blow out the fiscal deficit to 4.2 per cent of GDP by the end of the year, Dr Pardede said last week.\n\nThat gap would exceed the 3 per cent legal ceiling, that can trigger a vote of no-confidence in the president by the House of Representatives.\n\n\"They have no choice,\" said Fauzi Ichsan, senior economist and head of government relations with Standard Chartered. \"The government will need private investors.\"\n\nWhile Mr Prabowo appears to have closed the gap in support, the contest remains \"Widodo's to lose\", Mr Ichsan said.\n\nA poll by the Populi Centre, which most accurately forecast the results of the April 9 parliamentary elections, gave Mr Widodo and his running mate, former vice-president Jusuf Kalla, the support of 48 per cent of respondents to Mr Prabowo's 36 per cent, with 16 per cent undecided. Mr Prabowo is running with former coordinating minister for economic affairs in the Yudhoyono cabinet, Hatta Rajasa.\n\nMr Widodo's sliding popularity has taken many by surprise after months of polls that favoured him as much as two to one over any rival.\n\nThe narrowing gap can be blamed, in part, on a smear campaign circulating on social media and in Islamic boarding schools that Mr Widodo was formerly a Christian who is bent on scaling back Islam's influence in a nation where 90 per cent of the population is Muslim. Mr Widodo was late to hit back, saying that he went on the Haj pilgrimage in 2003.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Every intending investor would be justified in pondering the potential for ruin despite being innocent. Indeed, this case has all the hallmarks of industrial sabotage.\n\nOn May 24, Malaysia's Health Ministry warned that substances forbidden to Muslims (non-halal) were found in Cadbury Dairy Hazelnut and Cadbury Dairy Milk Roast Almond chocolate bars. In a statement issued to the mass media, the ministry's top official, Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah, said tests had been conducted the previous day following allegations on social media that confectionery tainted by porcine DNA was on sale to Muslims. He confirmed that samples of two types of chocolates (out of three analysed) had tested positive for porcine DNA. The manufacturer, Cadbury Confectionery Malaysia, immediately recalled these products from the market and launched an investigation on its supply chain.\n\nMalaysian Muslims were outraged on hearing the news and 20 Malay-Muslim groups called for a total boycott of all Cadbury products. Some radicals even threatened to burn down the factory. For a week, it looked as if the company, a pioneer in Malaysia's industrialisation, would be better off closing down.\n\nThen, in a stunning reversal a week later, Malaysia's apex agency on Islamic matters, the Department of Islamic Development (known by its Malay acronym Jakim), said 11 samples of Cadbury Dairy Milk Hazelnut and Cadbury Dairy Milk Roast Almond bars were taken directly from the factory to an accredited laboratory for testing and found to be untainted; no porcine DNA was found. Jakim is the only agency with the authority to ensure products are halal, or permissible under Islamic law. Dr Jamil Khir Baharom, the minister in charge of Islamic religious affairs, offered the explanation that the tests conducted by the Health Ministry could have been flawed as the samples were not taken directly from Cadbury's factory but rather from shop shelves where the contamination might have occurred.\n\nThere can be no challenge to the principle that people of faith have a right to have their dietary preferences respected. This incident, however, suggests mischief or, worse, skullduggery afoot. The company has suffered substantial damage to its business, not only in Malaysia but in other Muslim countries as well. Indeed, the tumult could well have destroyed a smaller company. Who will now compensate Cadbury for loss of sales as well as damage to its reputation?\n\nOther questions remain. Who started those rumours on social media? What were their motives? Where and how did contamination of the samples tested by the Health Ministry occur? If Malaysia wants to be taken seriously as a manufacturing hub for halal products (as it likes to promotes itself), the authorities must act to allay fears of foreign investors and quickly get to the bottom of this matter in a fair and transparent manner.

Now, the supplier of private aircraft for the Ferrari motor racing team is looking into a new joint venture far from home - manufacturing in China.\n\nWith the Ferrari family still owning a small stake, Piaggio Aero has talked to Chinese state companies and provincial government officials about setting up a joint venture to make planes, according to Giuliano Felten, its chief commercial officer.\n\nIf Piaggio Aero finds a partner, it will join a growing string of smaller aircraft makers who have drawn inspiration from the way global carmakers teamed up with local partners over 20 years ago, eventually turning China into the world's biggest car market.\n\nFor planemakers from Cessna to Embraer, the business jet market in Greater China offers the prospect of rampant growth. Deliveries could top 2,400 over the next 20 years, worth more than US$65 billion and eight times the current fleet, according to Canadian aircraft maker Bombardier - a fraction of the US$257 billion expected in sales in North America over the same period, but still a major growth opportunity.\n\n\"It will be easier for everybody to play in this country while having an ambassador participating in the country as opposite to importing the products from abroad,\" Piaggio Aero's Mr Felten told Reuters at a recent industry showcase in Shanghai.\n\n\"We are considering this very seriously,\" he said, declining to identify potential partners in China. There is no project on the table for now in what is \"a future possibility\", he said.\n\nDrawing aircraft makers to China fits with Beijing's plans to make the country a major manufacturing base for aircraft production, from small aircraft to full-fledged commercial planes that can compete with the likes of Airbus and Boeing. Yet, while China's car manufacturing base has expanded rapidly, its own carmakers still struggle to compete with Western rivals.\n\nIn the car industry, China, unlike Brazil or India, requires foreign carmakers who want to manufacture in the country to team up with local partners, who share half the proceeds and use the joint venture production to bolster their own earnings. Foreign aircraft makers are also required to team up with a local partner to make jets in the country.\n\nAt the higher end of the small aircraft industry, some say that the smaller volumes in the business jet industry mean it makes little economic sense to construct new plants in China. Business jets cost millions of dollars to buy, or thousands of dollars to rent by the hour.\n\nFor William Schultz, responsible for developing Textron Inc's aviation business in China including the Cessna brand, it was a rational choice to team up with a well-connected partner like Caiga, China Aviation Industry Co's (Avic) general aviation company.\n\n\"In most airplane transactions today, there is always a local connection even when we are selling to entrepreneurs,\" Mr Schultz told Reuters at the Shanghai industry event. \"It's important for us to have a partner like Caiga, which has sound relationships and can now introduce our products, our joint ventures to them.\"\n\nBrazil's Embraer also agreed in 2012 to start assembling its Legacy 650 business jet at Harbin Embraer, another JV with Avic in north-east China.\n\nThe lure of the world's second-biggest economy remains beyond question for small planemakers such as Piaggio Aero.\n\nChief commercial officer Mr Felten remains optimistic, expecting considerable growth in the business aviation market. While a joint manufacturing venture remains a future possibility, the company in April appointed a local firm as the first authorised service centre in mainland China for its twin-engine turboprop P180 Avanti - a plane in the range used by Ferrari. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

On Monday, his government revealed its roadmap through an address to a joint session of Parliament by President Pranab Mukherjee, who said the priorities for the government would be energy, infrastructure and the creation of manufacturing jobs.\n\nMr Mukherjee's clear articulation of goals should give businesses and investors cause for cheer, particularly after the previous government's waffling over policy decisions. He promised tax rationalisation and acknowledged that retrospective tax laws, ironically introduced by him when he was Finance Minister in the previous government, is not a step in the right direction. He also reiterated the government's commitment to implement a GST (goods and services tax) regime to replace India's arcane tax laws. GST has hit a roadblock on account of opposition from many state governments, particularly those ruled by Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). A government panel has noted that a countrywide GST regime could add 1-2 percentage points to India's GDP. Mr Mukherjee also reiterated the government's commitment to push growth to 8 per cent and above, a rate that the country needs in order to create enough jobs for the 20 million or so new entrants into the workforce every year. Separately, Mr Modi has stated that one of his priorities would be to curb runaway government spending and lower the current account deficit.\n\nThere are signs that the economy may already be improving. In its first review of the monetary policy since the election, the Reserve Bank of India has held the Repo rate steady at 8 per cent. This should release liquidity into the system and help to boost confidence and fuel investment. The stock markets have gained around 3 per cent since the elections results were announced and, till last week, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) had pumped in about US$1.2 billion, post-elections, into the stock market. The Indian rupee has also rallied against the US dollar. Tax consultancy Ernst & Young has predicted an uptick in economic growth to 6.2 per cent this fiscal year and 8 per cent over the next three years.\n\nWhile specific policies are important, if Mr Modi can correct the policy paralysis of the previous government, then that itself would boost growth. A recent government report showed that as many as 285 projects, involving investments of around US$270 billion, are held up because of a lack of necessary clearances or turf wars between different government departments. A project monitoring group has been set up under a senior civil servant to speed up clearances of these projects. Mr Modi has also set up groups to monitor implementation once projects are cleared. It remains to be seen if he can turn around India's economy the way he turned around that of Gujarat state. But as the improved investor sentiment suggests, he has made a positive beginning.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This compares with the overall revenue of US$3.89 billion for the previous full cycle from 2007 to 2010.\n\n\"The numbers show the continuing desire of broadcasters and sponsors to be associated with soccer's biggest festival, which in an increasingly fragmented media landscape, has the almost unique power to unite a nation in front of the television and attract mass audiences across the globe,\" said Sportcal deputy editors Simon Ward and Martin Ross, in their article for the latest issue of the magazine Sportcal Insight.\n\nAnd in what is probably of no surprise to Singaporeans, the writers added that \"broadcast rights sales will once again represent the largest share of turnover for Fifa from its showpiece tournament, as was the case four years ago\".\n\n\"As one of the sport's few mass audience events, the World Cup continues to offer broadcasters not only millions of eyeballs and advertising dollars, but also prestige and, for the likes of pay-television operators BelN Sports in the Middle East and North Africa, and SingTel in Singapore, valuable subscription revenues,\" they said.\n\nThey noted that Fifa has enjoyed considerable success selling media rights for the 2014 World Cup, largely through concluding deals in-house with broadcasters, but also via lucrative agreements with agencies in Asia and tie-ups with broadcasting unions in Europe, Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe Sportcal writers said that, based on Mr Valcke's estimates 12 months ago, media rights were set to account for between US$2.4 billion and US$2.6 billion of revenues for World Cup 2014, though additional deals have been signed since. Fifa has also inked valuable media rights deals for future tournaments in important territories.\n\nTicket sales are also soaring. Ahead of the final ticket sales phase, 2.6 million had already been allocated. Fifa has also revamped its sponsorship structure for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, with the six \"national supporters\" to be replaced by up to 20 \"regional supporters\" from different territories - which Fifa expects will lift its income by as much as 30 per cent.\n\nBut what of Brazil itself, which has invested some US$11 billion - US$4 billion for new and renovated stadia and US$7 billion for related infrastructure - into hosting the World Cup?\n\nDoubts remain over how much the country can recoup. Recent surveys of the population have shown that many believe the tournament will do more harm than good to Brazil.\n\nFifa, for its part, has denied that it is taking money away from Brazil in staging the tournament there.\n\n\"Fifa is not asking for any financial support from the Brazilian authorities and whatever is spent by the cities and by the government will remain within the country,\" Mr Valcke said. \"It is in the infrastructure (and other) things which will be used by the country and will not be taken away by Fifa when we fly away from Brazil on the 14th of July, after the final.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

While the Morgan Stanley report was neutral on Indonesia, Thailand was the analysts' least-preferred market.\n\nOn the Singapore front, the report noted that the country's firms are facing \"severe pressure on profitability\" with net income margin expected to come in at its lowest since 2000 - 7.6 per cent for 2014 based on consensus estimates.\n\nEven so, Morgan Stanley believes that a \"trend reversal\" in profitability could be on the horizon, both because of the low base effect and a better growth outlook.\n\n\"Interestingly, consensus also expects Singapore's overall profitability to trough in 2014 at 7.6 per cent, and sees improvement in margins to 7.7 per cent and 8.0 per cent in 2015 and 2016, respectively,\" the report noted.\n\nWithin the country, Singapore Airlines is one of the firms that Morgan Stanley analysts have an \"overweight\" rating on. They foresee the airline group pulling in an average net income margin of 5.1 per cent for 2014-2015, above the consensus estimate of 3.3 per cent.\n\n\"Our above-consensus estimates stem from higher-than-consensus top-line assumptions,\" the report said.\n\n\"We believe this stems from higher-than-consensus yield growth assumptions. We expect passenger yields to improve by 3 per cent in FY2015 and 1.7 per cent in FY2016. . . . We believe the market has yet to price in potential improvement in passenger yields, and think risk is now on the upside.\"\n\nWilmar International, also rated \"overweight\", received some favourable attention in the report, with Morgan Stanley forecasting the former's 2014-2015 average net income margin at 3.1 per cent against the consensus estimate of 2.7 per cent.\n\n\"We think Wilmar's near-term margin outlook is soft because of oversupply in the Chinese soya bean crushing business,\" the report said.\n\n\"However, we forecast margins will improve gradually as industry oversupply in the China soya bean crushing business get absorbed over time. We believe Wilmar margin will normalise towards peer levels over the long term.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Macau is next with 20 per cent, followed by Singapore (12 per cent) and Taiwan (7 per cent).\n\nConcentration for larger countries is relatively low: Australia at 1.2 per cent and Japan, 0.6 per cent.\n\nFitch said: \"Most exposure is trade-related, financing foreign companies' operations in China and Chinese entities' outbound expansion, the latter comprising predominantly state-owned enterprises or large Chinese corporates.\"\n\nFinancing small and medium-sized enterprises and retail activity resides with the banks, which are driven by their regional aspirations to build the most developed onshore subsidiary operations, it said. Fitch listed HSBC, Standard Chartered, Bank of East Asia, DBS and ANZ as the Asia-Pacific banks with the most developed onshore subsidiary operations.\n\nThe rating agency commented that a \"hard landing\" for China's economy was a low-probability - but high-impact - downside risk to banks in Hong Kong and, increasingly, across the Asia-Pacific. Fitch said it expected regulators such as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to take a closer look at emerging China concentrations.\n\nRegulators are unlikely to place a cap on banks' China business but maybe behind the scenes, in particular the HKMA, are investigating and talking to the banks on their exposure, said Mark Young, Fitch head of Asia Pacific financial institutions.\n\nSingapore-based banks have been increasing their lending to the region, in particular to China and India, said the Monetary Authority of Singapore Financial Stability Review last December. The increasing exposure to these two Asian giants should be seen in the context of their rising economic importance, though banks must manage their risks, it said.\n\nThe total volume of loans to China, comprising interbank loans, non-bank loans and trade bills, has been trending up since 2009. During this period, the composition of loans has changed significantly.\n\nSince August 2011, trade bills overtook interbank loans to become the primary component of loans to China. As at last September, trade bills accounted for about 65 per cent of total loans from Singapore to China.\n\nSeparately, Deloitte yesterday noted that China's \"shadow banking\" system, made up of trust companies set up to circumvent the restrictions on formal banking, has grown to a record size despite the government's curbs on it.\n\nDeloitte said in a near-term outlook piece on the region: \"It appears that, despite government efforts to the contrary, credit in the non-bank shadow banking system continues to rise rapidly.\" The government has reported that, in the first quarter, trust company assets had grown 8 per cent from a year ago to 11.7 trillion yuan (S$2.34 trillion), a new high. \"The average return on trust assets has declined,\" it said.\n\nThe trusts lend money to private enterprises, including property investors, and raise money by selling trust products to private investors, usually offering a return far higher than is available through formal banks.\n\n\"The trusts are often informally backed by banks.\"\n\nThe problem is that trusts have loaned money for many projects that are not expected to generate positive returns; increasingly, they could face trouble meeting their obligations and may require help from banks.\n\nDeloitte said: \"Banks, in turn, could find themselves in trouble. Thus, further growth of this shadow banking activity is worrisome.\n\n\"Although it contributes to economic growth in the short term, it creates more stress on the financial system in the longer run. It is thus not a sustainable model for future growth.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By MRI's estimates, Trafigura trades twice the amount of copper concentrates, MRI's main product, as it does.\n\nIn naphtha, a product that the group chose to start trading due to Singapore's strength as an energy hub, MRI already occupies 8-10 per cent of the three largest importing markets of Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, said Mr Kuek.\n\n\"We pick commodities where we can have significant share,\" he said. \"Otherwise if you try to be everything to everybody, you end up being nothing to nobody. That's why we are very focused.\"\n\nThe group also moved into metals to tap the synergies and its existing relationships with smelters, and has generated $490 million in turnover from metals alone in the first four months of this year.\n\nCWT recorded net profit of $35 million for the first quarter of this year on $4.5 billion in revenue, with commodity marketing contributing 38 per cent of its gross profit.\n\nSeeing that traders today need a \"bigger suite of activity\" to service counterparties, MRI has also grown its structured finance team, which deals with pre-payment, project financing, and credit insurance.\n\nThe next stage of development for MRI will come from CWT's brokering division Straits Financial, which was recently granted the licence by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to conduct trading in futures contracts, allowing it to expand beyond over-the-counter derivatives.\n\n\"Now that we have access to the futures market as well, it will be a more holistic business rather than just sticking to the traditional trading house model,\" said Mr Loi.\n\nThis is also part of CWT's philosophy to provide \"a whole suite\" of solutions for its clients, all the better to beef up margins within the commodity trading business where profit margins are usually razor-thin.\n\nBut Mr Loi is not in a hurry to tie the various businesses of warehousing, commodities trading and brokerage services together for greater synergies.\n\n\"Every single division needs to be fully independent first and foremost. They must be able to stand on their own two feet,\" he said.\n\n\"If you chain all your businesses and force them to work with each other, you will end up with some that are uncompetitive and just relying on each other to give them the daily bread.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/nwc-staying-relevant", "site_title": "NWC: Staying relevant", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nNWC: Staying relevant\n\nAs a CEO and employer, what is your response to the National Wages Council's recommendations each year? How can the NWC enhance its role in today's economic climate?\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jun 8, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nDhirendra Shantilal\n\nBoard Director & Head of Asia Pacific\n\nFircroft\n\nAT Fircroft, we look at a number of factors to ensure our employees receive highly competitive salaries. We consider market wage rates but also take into account international pay scales, the cost of living, bonuses, performance-based pay, benefits, training and development. And as a firm in the recruitment industry, we see the NWC guidelines largely as markers that allow us to measure where our packages stand. The tripartite mechanism remains extremely useful as it ensures all the key stakeholders meet and establish realistic and mutually beneficial wage guidelines.\n\nTo remain relevant, the NWC must continue widening its focus by offering best-practice recommendations across wage brackets. Industry-specific feedback should also be included, as wage guidelines for the energy sector may differ from those in retail. Broadly the council should not look purely at wages but also issue guidelines that encompass training, bonuses and healthcare benefits that ensure the needs of workers and employers are balanced.\n\nBrad Adams\n\nHead of HR Research in Asia\n\nCEB\n\nTO compete in Asia, companies need a comprehensive talent strategy - not just fair pay policies. That is true for hourly workers and corporate talent alike. Business leaders can only maximise people investments if they apply the same level of rigour to them as they do other corporate investments. CEB research shows talent as the number one driver of sustainable corporate performance. In today's hyper-competitive global economy, corporate winners and losers are defined by companies' ability to attract, deploy, and retain the best talent, not just their ability to achieve fair pay policies.\n\nSingapore lags behind 27 other major economies on employee willingness to put in extra effort at work and intent to stay with the company. However, these productivity and retention challenges cannot be solved by pay alone. Upward career mobility, broader management practices, and especially work-life balance, come before pay in motivating Singapore- based employees to produce more and stay longer.\n\nLaletha Nithiyanandan\n\nManaging Director\n\nTalent Design Potential\n\nFIRST of all, I think we have to see the real situation for what it is. The cost of living has gone up considerably, year on year. It's consistent with what's happening in the market. This is a real cost that employers have to pay for the services they are receiving.\n\nWhy is it that we are willing to pay more rent for our facilities but gripe about paying people slightly more? In my view, this is not about NWC and its relevance. It's about employers and business owners being more community-minded. Whilst profit is important, the needs of this group of employees cannot be overlooked. NWC is relevant as they seem to be the only voice for this group of people. An extra $60 isn't much for most of us, but it makes a big difference to the lives of people who earn less than $1,000 a month.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPlan-B Icag Pte Ltd\n\nTHE pay rise of at least $60 for workers earning below $1,000 is another step in the right direction to close the bourgeoning wage gap between high wage earners and their low wage counterparts. At $60, ie, at least a 6 per cent raise, the pay rise is more than inflation, making it also meaningful and true to the objective of the recommendation.\n\nThat said, both employees and employers must continue to improve productivity, to negate the increase in costs. Every ten $1,000 workers will cost a company at least $7,200 annually; the wage hike goes up by a factor of 10 for a 10-fold increase in headcount. For a company with 1,000 such employees, it's an additional $720,000 in the annual wage bill.\n\nOther than productivity increases, employers can explore other cost measures to support this recommendation. One way, as has been suggested by others, is to set aside a portion of the compensation of senior management for this group of workers. Employers should also take advantage of the government's wage credit scheme. The NWC provides an objective and independent view of wage management in Singapore. It thus has a useful role to play in today's economic climate, rising above the public, private and people sectors.\n\nAllen Ang\n\nMD\n\nAldon Technologies\n\nLIKE in the previous year, we support NWC's recommendation to give workers earning less than $1,000 a $60 increment. Against the backdrop of rising living costs, this group of workers needs special assistance. However the built-in wage hike coupled with increases in overall business costs will add more pressure to many SMEs. The only solution is to raise the productivity of this group of workers quickly. At Aldon all our workers are crossed-trained to handle precision engineering tasks involving specialised equipment and tools of different processes. All of them are earning well above the minimum wage level.\n\nWe would like the NWC to focus on its economic role in providing guidelines for a sustainable and competitive wage structure.\n\nChris Comer\n\nCEO\n\nCastlewood Group\n\nIT is widely acknowledged that the cost of living in Singapore is on the rise, so it's necessary for the NWC to look after the needs of workers, in particular low-wage earners.\n\nAs an employer that already implements a wage structure that is reflective of our business performance, we have discovered firsthand how this approach is a sustainable way to reward productivity whilst still keeping an eye on the bottomline. This approach is implemented across a number of departments, rather than the conventional method of focusing on sales teams. Apart from providing our staff with a good basic salary, the real bonus is delivered in direct response to department performance as we find that not only does this motivate staff to deliver, it also keeps productivity and employee satisfaction high - essential to retaining talent in the tight labour market. Companies need to clearly communicate how staff can progress in their career and earn bigger salaries in order to ensure an ongoing increase in productivity and performance.\n\nWhilst the NWC's recommendations aren't mandatory, we must remember that smaller firms are still reeling from the increase in the employers' CPF contribution for workers. So this latest wage recommendation may be tough on some right now. Personally, this is where I think the NWC needs to extend its responsibilities by supporting smaller firms and ensuring that they are taking advantage of the various Transition Support packages on offer, such as the Wage Credit Scheme.\n\nAs the labour market is expected to tighten later this year due to the revamped foreign workforce policy, perhaps the NWC should also look at ways to help support companies that rely on foreign workers as they fight to retain talent at a time when productivity is so crucial to business success.\n\nHugues Delcourt\n\nCountry Executive, ABN Amro Bank NV Singapore, and\n\nCEO of ABN Amro Private Banking Asia & Middle East\n\nWE support NWC's annual recommendations as it provides a helpful benchmark and seeks to improve people's livelihood. Given today's challenging economic climate, businesses also have to be mindful of the need to improve productivity and performance, in order to ensure the sustainability of wage increments.\n\nThe greatest and most invaluable resource is our people. We strongly believe in being a responsible employer and in investing in them, not only through monetary perks but also by providing training and development opportunities. Allowing our employees to upgrade their skills ensures that they can progress in their career, are self-sufficient and able to make valuable contributions to the business. Taking a long-term perspective and investing in our employees' development and upward mobility will support our growth and help us to remain competitive in the current challenging business environment.\n\nLow Lee Yong\n\nCEO and Founder\n\nMHC Asia Group of Companies\n\nWHAT we do not want is a situation where market forces are distorted by policy interference. Wages should be more than a cash salary. Incentives like company trips, surprise awards and individualised gifts for deserving staff help inject fun and excitement to the workplace. There are also the less tangible aspects like the workplace culture, supportive colleagues, and a fun working environment.\n\nAll these are possible areas to look into as part of a more holistic remuneration system.\n\nHaider Rashid\n\nCountry President Singapore & Region President\n\nSouth Asia\n\nABB\n\nAS a global engineering company, ABB takes its responsibilities as a major employer seriously, whether it is reward and recognition, health and safety or learning and development. As part of this, we have long-standing, collaborative relationships with employee groups around the world, be it an on-site union representative, local unions or on a pan-regional basis such as with the European Works Council.\n\nIn Singapore, we support the NWC and its important efforts to bring together the different perspectives of unions, government and private-sector employers. We believe that the guidelines ensure that wage increases are consistent across industries and in line with the general health of the economy. At ABB, we strive to pay all our employees competitively as part of our attraction and retention strategies. For lower-wage earners, we collaborate with the union to ensure that salary increases are adequate against any rise in the cost of living by having a fixed dollar amount in addition to a percentage increase.\n\nAnnie Yap\n\nManaging Director\n\nAYP Associates Pte Ltd\n\nTHE NWC's proposed wage increase is aimed at closing the income gap between low wage workers and middle income workers as well as increasing productivity in the long run. As such, it is a welcome recommendation to help low-wage workers. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of the pay rise in ultimately benefiting the workers will be limited if the company is unable to increase their productivity and has instead to raise product prices.\n\nIn today's economic climate, NWC's role is relevant as it serves as a guide to both employers and employees on the wages to ensure Singapore remains competitive and in tandem with our economic growth. However, NWC's role is just a guide and ultimately, to be able to attract the good employees, companies have to go beyond just giving the average pay to employees.\n\nChristophe Duchatellier\n\nCEO\n\nAdecco Asia\n\nTHE National Wages Council's recommendations and efforts are highly commendable in promoting and advocating equity in the workplace. It is good to note that all employees, regardless of rank and pay scale, are covered and that there is extra care given to low-wage earners.\n\nSingapore's highly competitive marketplace - and being one of the most expensive cities in the world - impacts not just low-wage earners but middle-income earners as well. The NWC's continued engagement with business and organisations can rise to a mutual advantage for both employers and employees. Adecco offers competitive compensation packages and continually reviews its compensation schemes in line with the industry as well as the current economic climate.\n\nDora Hoan\n\nCo-Chairman/Group CEO\n\nBest World International Ltd\n\nI AGREE with the National Wages Council's recommendation to grant wage increments subject to company performance. In addition, as espoused by NWC, companies should also focus on raising productivity in this tight labour market. The wage increment has to be in proportion to productivity gains.\n\nI feel that the recommendations by NWC are valid. NWC has helped us overcome numerous challenges over the last few decades by offering useful recommendations to local companies. This has brought about a sustainable long-term growth that has also benefited the workers in Singapore. I believe that this will continue.\n\nRobin C Lee\n\nGroup COO\n\nBok Seng Group\n\nONE main concern in today's society is the ever-widening gap between the rich and poor. To have a peaceful world, especially on the socio-economic front, redistribution of wealth must be aggressively promoted to ensure that the Gini index narrows to create a more equitable society. Any further widening of our wealth gap will slowly but indelibly create social difficulties which may lead to a deep rupture of the social fabric. As such, I feel that efforts must be made to assist the lower-income group by helping them to better cope with rising inflation which has made cost of living in this country unbearable.\n\nI am supportive and appreciative of NWC's continual recommendation to guide and prompt companies to assist the lower paid workers. However, manpower costs cannot increase indefinitely and we have to have parallel improvements in efficiency and productivity; therefore it is vital that the government continues to provide support and incentives to get companies in this direction.\n\nDavid Leong\n\nManaging Director\n\nPeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd\n\nTHE National Wages Council proposes wage adjustments according to shifting economic and labour conditions but it has no teeth. However the toothless advocate sets the tone and direction of wage adjustments. The quantum for adjustments are mostly debatable but at least it sets the direction - rise or fall or simply stay flat. Without NWC's recommendations, employers, particularly SMEs, may not be guided by macro trends in employment and wages. NWC sets a reference point for companies to peg themselves against and to adjust according to their circumstances.\n\nNWC is still very relevant and its role should continue. NWC's formulation must be tied to the inflation rate and cost of living levels, but wage adjustments must take into account productivity improvements. Ultimately, NWC must be seen to set fair and balanced recommendations. Finding the balance is always a challenge.\n\nSam Yap\n\nGroup Executive Chairman and Co-Founder\n\nHtwo Investment Holdings Pte Ltd\n\nTHE NWC's recommendations and guidelines serve as a useful benchmark for employers in considering wage adjustments for their employees. Employers however will have to consider other factors like the company's overall performance, their respective sector growth, the labour market, industry competitiveness and related issues.\n\nAs the guidelines are not compulsory or mandatory, companies have the flexibility to use them as reference in their annual wage adjustments. Some businesses may be able to implement the NWC guidelines but for others, there may be constraints.\n\nIn my mind, companies should endeavour to take steps to stay competitive and adopt productivity and innovative efforts in their work processes to drive positive outcomes and business growth. Employers will duly reward their staff accordingly and fairly.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Has the peanut oil shipment a bank lent money against been swapped for worthless water?\n\nBasic questions have begun to play on the minds of traders and bankers doing business in the world's largest raw material importer, after an investigation began at Qingdao Port, a huge trading hub in the north-east, into whether more than one licence had been issued against the same material.\n\nThe duplication, which leaves someone out of pocket when they claim what they thought was theirs, may be the result of deliberate fraud by a company using the same metal to raise multiple loans.\n\nThe case of Qingdao, the world's seventh-largest port, has yet to play out and could be an isolated problem involving one or a handful of companies, rather than endemic at ports.\n\nBut for many Western traders eyeing the gargantuan growth of China's commodity demand, credit is a touchy issue that brings back memories of the 2008 financial crisis, making them especially jumpy when credit related issues arise.\n\nLast Friday, Qingdao Port said that it had been asked by China's Public Security Authority to help with an investigation relating to aluminium and copper products under the name of a third-party cargo shipment agency on behalf of a cargo owner.\n\nIt did not say how much metal was involved, but said that it was an \"immaterial proportion\" of its total annual throughput, and added that none of its employees were under investigation.\n\nYet, in a country where oversight of commodity warehousing is generally accepted as weaker than in developed financial centres, the case is making people nervous.\n\nAlready, some copper cargoes being held at Qingdao are being shipped to warehouses outside the country that are regulated by the London Metal Exchange (LME), industry sources said, in what one trade executive called a \"classic flight to quality\".\n\nA full-blown scare at Qingdao and beyond would not only affect the supply chain and price of commodities.\n\nRaising money using copper, iron ore or soya beans as collateral for relatively cheap loans is big business in China, a ready source of credit for investors who can then pour the funds into other ventures such as property.\n\nIt is also increasingly important in China as banks become stricter in extending credit.\n\nCommodity finance deals in China were worth as much as US$160 billion, about 31 per cent of the country's total short-term foreign exchange loans, Goldman Sachs said in March.\n\nThe immediate fallout from the investigation could make such financing in China - already under scrutiny by authorities - even harder and costlier. \"Since the Qingdao case, we, as well as others in the market, have become a lot more cautious and are very selective on who we trade with,\" said the head of a metals unit at a Chinese state-owned trading firm. \"As for us, we are now only willing to work with big trading companies, those with which we've had a long-term working relationship or companies that have solid finances. This will be the strategy for many of us until we get more clarity.\"\n\nStandard Chartered said that it was reviewing metals financing to a small number of companies in China. Three sources said that the lender had suspended new metal financing to some customers in the country.\n\nAn executive in charge of commodity financing at an Australian bank said that lenders would pause to take stock of how serious the problem in China was.\n\n\"If it's concentrated around one particular firm, we can probably quarantine it in that way and get ourselves back to a level of comfort relatively quickly,\" he said. \"If there's not already, it probably points to the fact that there needs to be a central registry of warehouse receipts.\"\n\nGreater oversight of Chinese warehousing is needed to reduce the risk of future lapses, say China legal experts. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The Singapore government also typically takes the stage to announce new plans or initiatives during the show.\n\nThis year, more than 2,000 vendors will pack five floors of the Marina Bay Sands exhibition hall across a combined floor space of 58,500 square metres, slightly bigger than last year's 57,600 square meters.\n\nSome 50,000 visitors are expected at the show, a figure similar to last year's.\n\nVictor Wong, project director for both CommunicAsia and sister show BroadcastAsia, said this year's event throws a spotlight on connectivity and mobility equipment. BroadcastAsia will be held concurrently with CommunicAsia at the Marina Bay Sands, and features professional audio and video technology.\n\nThis will run the gamut of possible services, including mobile payment, smart metering and remote sensing, he said.\n\nThe focus on mobility services has risen on the back of trends such as Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), and vendors at the show are keen to exhibit what the future of these technologies will mean for businesses, Mr Wong said.\n\nThis is why there has been a greater focus on satellite communications technology from the industry. In previous years, satellite technologies mainly covered offerings for defence agencies, but there has been growing interest in machine-to-machine (M2M) communications from the industry, said Mr Wong.\n\nM2M technologies are closely related to the larger IoT concept that has recently come to mainstream attention. IoT refers to a network of interconnected gadgets and systems, and includes \"smart\" appliances such as Web-connected refrigerators and wearable smartwatches connected to mobile phones, for example.\n\nThe idea is gathering steam because more gadgets and appliances are being made to \"talk\" to one another as sensor prices come down. This is vastly expanding the possible applications of IT to be able to intelligently detect and offer information to users based on their lifestyles.\n\nResearch firm Frost & Sullivan forecasts that the total connected devices market will reach US$731.7 billion by 2020. Within this, spending on smart city infrastructure will contribute the largest proportion at 54 per cent, fuelled mainly by smart government and e-education projects. Connected enterprises will comprise 31 per cent, and digital home equipment the remaining 15 per cent.\n\nSome of the new technology to be seen at the show include audio manufacturer Sennheiser's connected audio for business spaces, Panasonic's first 4K 20 inch tablet running Windows 8.1, and home medical kits for smartphones from BioSenze.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Also, there will always be bargain hunters,\" he said.\n\nThe three had plunged last October, wiping billions of dollars off their market capitalisations, after adding them just months before.\n\nAfter the big crash, the three stocks continued to trade down.

This will result in a deluge of data which in turn will put pressure on companies to find new ways and resources to store and process this data. The trend is already noticeable in the region.\n\nRavi Rajendran, vice-president and general manager for Asean & India at Hitachi Data Systems (HDS), tells BizIT that the \"daunting challenge\" of Big Data is becoming a very real problem and \"businesses on flat IT budgets are struggling to manage the rapid increase in data volume and complexity\".\n\nHDS provides high-end storage systems as well as software and services for data storage.\n\nMr Rajendran says that ultimately the goal of IT for most companies these days is two-fold; the first is to ensure the provision of optimal service to various business functions and customers. The second is for IT to shift from being a cost-centre to a revenue generator. This can be done by mining Big Data for business insights, or through the conversion of applications into revenue streams.\n\n\"These goals have changed the way companies traditionally view IT and data, and have paved the way for the creation of the business-defined IT,\" he says.\n\nOne spin-off from this is that CTOs (chief technology officers) and other traditional IT gatekeepers are no longer the sole decision makers for technology purchasing, Mr Rajendran notes. Technology, data and analytics have become more relevant than ever before and different business units are taking the lead in deciding what and when technologies are to be deployed within a company. Staying competitive is the name of the game.\n\n\"Take, for example, the healthcare industry. We are seeing more frontline medical professionals, such as doctors and technicians, playing a bigger role in deciding their organisation's IT roll-out and implementation. This is because they have a much more in-depth understanding of not only their patient's needs, but also the processes that they use which can impede or improve their efficiency in delivering optimal patient treatment and care.\"\n\nAs a company that provides storage systems, software and services, HDS has been planning for this shift to Big Data for six years, in collaboration with its parent company Hitachi, says Mr Rajendran.\n\n\"Already, across the various markets, we are seeing functionality clearly moving to the software level and that is no less true for HDS. What we have achieved with our updated product lines is a happy medium between both our hardware and software businesses, with 50 per cent of our revenue today coming from customers who understand the value of managing actionable data in a cost effective manner.\n\n\"Our recent announcements are a step forward towards cementing our technology leadership on the infrastructure layer. We have brought together the best of both worlds, in hardware and software specifically with capabilities around storage virtualisation and management in mission critical environments.\"\n\nHDS presents customers with a way to better manage and extend the lifespan of existing hardware and improve their IT infrastructure and applications without buying more hardware to accommodate the explosion of data, adds Mr Rajendran.\n\nIn terms of availability, the product updates will allow the maintenance of application service levels even during technology refreshes, spikes in data flow and data migrations, ensuring that companies experience zero downtime, says HDS.\n\n\"By automating, companies can roll out new IT environments faster and optimise the performance of their IT infrastructures, lowering overall costs and freeing up resources to focus on new business initiatives. Lastly, by providing an increased level of agility through software-led virtualisation and orchestration, companies can redeploy workloads faster, leading to faster time to market, while future-proofing IT assets,\" Mr Rajendran adds.\n\nHe says that Asean is a growth engine for HDS, but the region itself is very diverse, with each market being at different points in their technological journey and adoption, and hence are facing their own unique challenges. \"To help customers around the region, we are continuing our investment in the region, including developing markets like Vietnam and Myanmar.\"\n\nA tighter integration of both engineering and business drivers is shaping the direction of HDS, pushing initiatives such as converged cloud infrastructure and deeper partnerships with Hitachi and with other key players in the market, adds Mr Rajendran.\n\namit@sph.com.sg\n\n@AmitRoyCBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By EUGENE KANG\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jun 8, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIN my previous article, \"Multiple Directorships - How many is enough?\" (The Business Times, May 19, 2014), I examined the concern of time fragmentation of a director who is on too many boards. Another concern with multiple directorships which I will now explore is the creation of director interlocks between firms that generate conflicts of interest which may impede directors in the proper discharge of their duties.\n\nBefore discussing the two variants of interlocking directorships - horizontal and vertical - it is important to note that interlocks are not restricted to firms that appoint common board members.\n\nThe OECD report, Antitrust issues involving minority shareholding and interlocking directorates, suggests that the concept of interlocks should be extended to cover situations where, for example, a director of one firm is a top executive in another firm, or where the director's spouse is a director or top executive in another firm.\n\nHorizontal interlocks\n\nInterlocks between firms in the same industry are referred to as horizontal interlocks. From a governance perspective, directors are required to discharge their duties and responsibilities as fiduciaries of their firms.\n\nHowever, an interlock between rival firms can create serious conflicts of interest if it prevents an interlocking director from exercising his objective judgement and discharging his fiduciary duties to both firms.\n\nIn certain jurisdictions, horizontal interlocks attract anti-trust scrutiny. For instance, the Clayton Antitrust Act in the US currently prohibits, with certain exceptions, one person from serving as a director of two rival firms.\n\nWhile Singapore has a similar Competition Act, there are no specific provisions here that prohibit interlocks among rival firms.\n\nThis overlapping of business interests led to the resignation of Eric Schmidt, then CEO of Google, from Apple's board in 2009.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that both firms faced regulatory scrutiny over their interlock due to anti-trust concerns.\n\nSteve Jobs, then CEO of Apple, also commented that \"Eric's effectiveness as an Apple board member will be significantly diminished, since he will have to excuse himself from even larger portions of our meetings due to potential conflicts of interest.\"\n\nQuite apart from anti-competition concerns, conflicts of interest led two directors of SGX-listed Jurong Cement Ltd to resign from its board in 2009 because they were also employees of YTL Corporation, a competitor of Jurong Cement.\n\nAccording to the company's announcement, the rationale for the resignation was to address potential conflicts of interest when the board discussed \"competitive sensitive information in the presence of the directors representing a direct competitor\".\n\nVertical interlocks\n\nVertical interlocks are formed between firms in a buyer-seller relationship.\n\nA director that represents a buyer owes a duty to secure the lowest possible price from the seller. Conversely, a director that represents a seller owes a duty to secure the highest possible price from the buyer. When the same director represents both firms, it is easy to see how a conflict of interest arises.\n\nThe key issue in interlocks, whether vertical or horizontal is, therefore, that conflicts of interest can arise, and regulators and boards tend to have rules and policies focused on such situations.\n\nConflicts of interest\n\nTransactions between firms connected by vertical or horizontal interlocks can potentially be classified as interested party transactions (IPTs) under the SGX Listing Rules.\n\nIPTs extend to transactions between a listed firm and its directors, CEO, controlling shareholders, or an associate of the aforementioned persons.\n\nIn particular, Listing Rules 905 and 906 require material IPTs to be disclosed to, or even approved by, shareholders.\n\nIn 2011, the SGX reprimanded KXD Digital Entertainment Ltd for failing to announce and seek approval for sales by it to LG North America Inc.\n\nBoth firms were vertically interlocked as the chairman and CEO of KXD and the CEO of LG were spouses. The SGX noted that not only were Listing Rules 905 and 906 breached, the sales also resulted in substantial bad debts that had a material adverse impact on KXD, and which were detrimental to its minority shareholders.\n\nThis illustrates a key concern with interlocks. In some cases, the interlock can facilitate the expropriation of shareholder wealth from one company through inter-firm transactions on terms that favour the interested person.\n\nWhether an interlock is horizontal or vertical, Section 156(1) of the Companies Act applies to require every director of a firm who is, in any way, interested in a transaction or proposed transaction with the firm to declare the nature of his interest.\n\nWhile the disclosure of the conflict is the responsibility of the director concerned, it is the responsibility of the entire board to safeguard the interests of the firm and its shareholders by ensuring that any conflicts that arise are adequately and effectively addressed and that the firm complies with all relevant Listing Rules and regulations.\n\nThe author is a member of the Advocacy & Research Committee of the Singapore Institute of Directors.\n\nFor more articles, go to\n\nbtd.sg/BMatters\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That's at least 10 times more than in 2012.\n\nGrowth in Europe's fifth-largest economy is gaining momentum, kindling consumer demand by creating jobs and allowing the government to ease the toughest austerity measures in more than three decades.\n\nSpanish borrowing costs have dropped, with yields on 10-year government bonds last week hitting their lowest since Bloomberg began compiling the data in 1993.\n\n\"The value of retail property is heating up,\" said Andres Escarpenter, real estate broker JLL's chief executive officer for Spain, who estimates the price of stores in the swankiest districts of Spanish cities jumped as much as 15 per cent over the past year. \"Investors are also starting to factor into the pricing a recovery in consumption.\"\n\nBanks are getting ready to finance the upturn in consumer demand as the cost of covering their bad loans begins to abate.\n\nBanco Santander SA, Spain's biggest, last October bought a controlling stake in the finance unit of El Corte Ingles, the largest retailer, while Banco Popular Espanol SA is seeking to buy Citigroup's Spanish business, partly to tap its expertise in credit cards.\n\nCaixaBank SA and Bankia SA, the third- and fourth-biggest banks, say they are already starting to ramp up consumer lending. FinConsum, the consumer-credit arm of Barcelona-based CaixaBank, boosted lending by 40 per cent last year.\n\nThe recovery in consumer demand is still far from clear-cut with the data for retail sales still ambiguous, said Israel Casanova, managing director for Spain and Portugal of Redevco, an Amsterdam-based property management company that specialises in retail premises.\n\nSales rose an annual 0.1 per cent in April, down from growth of 0.4 per cent in March, and they shrank 0.3 per cent in February, according to statistics office INE.\n\nNational Association of Financial Credit Establishments chairman Oscar Cremer said in March that sustained recovery in credit probably wouldn't come until about 2017, when the economic recovery has created more jobs and given fresh impetus to the housing market.\n\n\"It's still far too early to say if the recovery is really solid but there does seem to be confidence,\" Mr Casanova added.\n\nHousehold spending overall grew 0.4 per cent in the first quarter from the previous three months, helping economic growth in the period to accelerate to 0.4 per cent from 0.2 per cent in the final quarter of 2013, INE said in May 29. Lending for consumption fell an annual 1.8 per cent in April, the smallest decline since January 2009, according to the European Central Bank (ECB).\n\nSpanish consumers were hammered as unemployment reached 27 per cent, driving retail sales down for 38 consecutive months through September last year, according to INE.\n\nThe process drained 47 billion euros of loans from the Spanish economy as consumer lending slumped 44 per cent from mid-2008, according to the ECB.\n\nThe deals getting done in Spain's retail property market anticipate a renewed demand from shoppers, Mr Casanova said.\n\nA fund managed by Orion paid 144.5 million euros in October last year to buy the 50 per cent stake it didn't already own in Puerto Venecia, a 890,000 square-foot retail park in Zaragoza, Spain, from British Land Co. The deal added to Orion's purchase in 2009 of Plenilunio, a mall in Madrid where the company has a waiting list of retailers looking for space and may be able to raise rents in the future, said Aref Lahham, a founding partner at London-based Orion.\n\n\"We basically thought that it was good to own dominant shopping centres which are very resilient in the downturn,\" he said. \"Dominant malls go from strength to strength as secondary malls die and you can capture their market share.\"\n\nIntu, the UK's biggest shopping-mall owner, teamed up with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board to buy Parque Principado, an 800,000 square-foot mall in Asturias last October.\n\n\"What we're seeing now is people that were previously invested in other sectors such as offices or warehouses are now looking at retail space - especially if it's premium,\" said Angeles Perez, director of high street retail at JLL in Madrid.\n\n\"There's a clear trend for investors repositioning themselves for a recovery in consumption.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

They are.\"\n\n\"The speed of decision and risk taking and all that is amazing,\" said Mr Enders, speaking while in Normandy for events to mark the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\nA 25-year veteran of the European defence and aerospace industry, Mr Enders also complained that the European Union was stifling innovation and warned that it must cut red tape.\n\n\"It should make us think as we look at the software industry, when you look at the IT industry at the Microsofts, Amazons, Facebooks, SpaceXs, Yahoos. It is all coming from the US.\"\n\nMr Enders said that many successful entrepreneurs in the United States were \"bright young Frenchmen and bright young Germans\" who had been forced to leave Europe to seek venture capital and a dynamic entrepreneurial environment.\n\nMr Enders was appointed CEO of European aerospace giant EADS in June 2012 and immediately attempted a merger with Britain's BAE systems, a deal that would have seen the group replace Boeing as the world's biggest aerospace and defence company.\n\nAfter the deal was blocked by Germany, Mr Enders initiated an overhaul of the group's structure which reduced political influence.\n\nHe rebranded EADS into Airbus Group, reoganising the company into three divisions by merging the defence and space businesses. He has since led a push to expand the group's business outside its home base in Europe, notably in Asia, the United States and the Middle East.\n\nAirbus decided in 2005 to set up a joint venture in China to assemble the medium-range A320 passenger jet, and the company plans to open an assembly line in 2015 in the southern US state of Alabama.\n\nMr Enders said that Airbus considered the project in the Chinese city of Tianjin a success, and that it was vital that the company develop a local identity as it expanded into foreign markets.\n\nHe said that Airbus had allayed reservations from Chinese airlines about taking a China-made plane. \"We have demonstrated that they are just as good, some people say even better, as those assembled in Europe.\"\n\nThe Airbus Group would continue to embed itself abroad through new assembly lines, engineering centres and supply partnerships. \"We clearly have beachheads that I hope we will be able to expand.\" - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Upon subscription, members receive two different wines - along with wine tasting notes - monthly, and they can also re-order their favourite bottles whenever they wish to, at a discounted price.\n\nThis latest round of funding comes from ESW Manage, a Singapore-headquartered private equity firm. Post-money, ESW will own a 20 per cent stake in The French Cellar; its founder and chairman Wong Yat Foo will also join the start-up as a director.\n\nThis comes shortly after Jackie Lee, managing partner at Kyosei Ventures, joined The French Cellar as chairman in March.\n\n\"Our immediate plans are to increase the adoption of wine subscription as the preferred way to consume wine in Singapore, as well as expand into Malaysia, Indonesia, China and Japan through joint ventures or greenfield projects,\" said Dr Morello.\n\nDemand for curated wine subscription and guided wine discovery is growing in Asia, he added.\n\n\"For one thing, wine lovers find it a challenge to choose their French wines because of the sheer volume of available choices. In France, there are currently over 300 appellations, and 115,000 winemakers producing more than seven billion bottles of wine yearly. This diversity is both an attraction and a problem.\"\n\nMoreover, mass affluents - the fastest growing segment in Asia - increasingly desire to learn more about their purchases as much as they desire high-quality goods. The French Cellar's wine discovery model - with tasting notes - allows this, said Dr Morello.\n\nBuilding a community of wine lovers is also something the start-up takes pride in. It holds at least one wine tasting session monthly, for members to discover new wines and network.\n\n\"We believe this is a happier and cooler way to run the business, rather than just a cold e-commerce website. When we flew Mr Rebut down for a recent wine tasting session to meet with our members, the response was electrifying,\" gushed Dr Morello.\n\nThe French Cellar currently boasts \"hundreds of subscribers\", and has clocked over $250,000 in revenue since October 2013. It most recently emerged as one of Asia's Top 50 Start-ups at Echelon 2014 - the largest tech start-up conference in Asia - and will be exhibiting at the event later this week.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/ping-pong-peons-and-paper", "site_title": "Ping pong, peons and the paper", "publish_date": null, "content": "Ping pong, peons and the paper\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 6, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHERE was, for a time, a small group of BT interns that called ourselves the Ping Pong Peons. Alliteration was unquestionably the top priority in our christening, but we also fancied the double entendre the name offered. Firstly, we were certainly enslaved to our daily fix of ping pong, so it aptly captured our table tennis obsession.\n\nBut read as \"peons who happen to play ping pong\", the moniker became a reference to the suffering-intern stereotype that was actually ironic. Rather than suffer through our internships, we found a workplace both welcoming and fun - an atmosphere created very much by the ping pong table housed in the BT recreation room.\n\nThe table arrived in BT a few weeks after the first peons did, an impulse buy by a pair of bored BT journalists (the rumour has it that it was the news editor and the office's chief entertainment officer) after a few ping pong sessions at the common SPH table located some floors beneath BT.\n\nThough it was a humble second-hand purchase lacking the quality and high-gloss finish of the SPH table, BT's ping pong table shaped our relationship with the newsroom immensely. Before being introduced to BT's table, none of the peons played ping pong with anything resembling regularity. But it quickly became something to look forward to at lunch during slower days, and as a break on the longer ones.\n\nIt's easy to see why.\n\nThough the confines of BT's rec room denied true mobility - one side is honour-bound not to smash the ball, while the other cannot serve to a particular corner where the wall juts out if paddlers want to be considered sporting - the table provided short bursts of fun exercise during otherwise sedentary days of phone calls, reading and typing. And the lousier a player you were, the more stray balls you would have to exert yourself picking up.\n\nThe steady rhythm of a casual ping pong rally also made a great soundtrack for conversation, and the peons collaborated to coin some of our best (or worst, depending on how you see it) headline puns with paddles in hand.\n\nBut casual ping pong dialogue invariably turns to trash-talking your opponents. I think this was truly beneficial to a handful of interns adapting to a new environment, as the back-and-forth bred an accelerated sense of familiarity. When a full-timer is comfortable asking two male peons why they didn't register in the women's doubles for BT's internal tournament, and the interns can retort that they feared she wouldn't be able to take losing to interns again, having already done so on the basketball court, it feels like they have known each other for far longer than they actually have.\n\nWe also got to know our colleagues and fellow interns beyond their work capacities, and whatever rigidity there is to interactions with these capable people outside the rec room tends to break down after you have seen them inside it.\n\nOne plays ping pong in a T-shirt, shorts and black dress socks and shoes; one makes inappropriate, involuntary moaning noises when hit by the ball; another dances to distract the opposition between strokes; yet another uses \"chicken backside\" as a profanity; and the chief entertainment officer commends her own strokes with praise so superlative that, if received from anyone else, it would have to be consumed with sarcasm.\n\nThe tabletop antics have also produced tangible, work-related benefits. There is usually little reason to roam around the newsroom, so ping pong brought together people who would otherwise never meet.\n\nFor example, working with one particular sub-editor for the first time was especially comfortable - he may have been a stranger in a working context, but I already knew him as the hero with the divine gift of trapping errant, whizzing ping pong balls between his chin and neck.\n\nIt was ultimately these characters that brought the table to life, even if the peons - who mostly ended our internships last week - made jokes about ping pong withdrawal symptoms that testified to how fun the game itself is.\n\nMuch of that fun was derived from knowing that your next doubles partner could come from any department or age group, that you could join a game with journalists, photographers and editors alike, and that these professionals were fully prepared to let their hair down and have a good time - attitudes that weren't confined to the rec room, but reflected a larger culture.\n\nSo, it never really mattered that ours was a used table that bore not one, but four suspect brands on its sides and routinely, inexplicably and noisily jettisoned one particular screw - a ping pong table is only as good as the people playing on it.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Dark patches in some condominium developments completed six to 12 months ago, or even longer, point to significant vacancy.\n\nAnalysts cite a host of factors, including strong investment demand for real estate after the global crisis, escalation in private home completions of late, and slower expatriate inflow. Vacancies are set to climb and rents fall in general. Suburban locations, where most of the supply is, will be the worst hit.\n\n\"If increasingly there are a lot of empty units,\" says Lee Lay Keng, DTZ regional head (SEA) research, \"it could indicate we're not making the best use of our limited land resources.\"\n\nAfter the global crisis, investors sought refuge in trusty assets such as real estate. Fuelled by the low interest rate environment, some took to hoarding property at new launches and are hence not bothered whether they can find a tenant after taking possession of their units, say observers. Some high net worth foreign buyers treat their Singapore property as a holiday home and leave it unoccupied most of the time.\n\nBut there are others who leave units vacant because they are not able to find tenants. As Ms Lee notes: \"Competition for tenants is increasingly intense, with both demand and supply factors at work. On the demand side, changes in labour policies have slowed down the flow of foreign professionals into Singapore while on the supply side, there is a higher-than-average number of private home completions.\"\n\nJLL national director Ong Teck Hui highlights that \"those who bought for rental returns would find themselves in a more competitive leasing market today, where units in mediocre locations would be more difficult to lease and therefore remain vacant for a longer duration, especially during this period of strong supply\".\n\nKu Swee Yong, CEO of Century 21, explains that those who acquired private homes, say in 2010, would already be sitting on profits. \"If they bought for capital gains, they may prefer to keep their unit empty rather than rent it out because it is quite usual for a fresh tenant to have a clause in the lease agreement protecting them from viewings by the landlord in the first six or even 12 months.\"\n\nR'ST Research director Ong Kah Seng says that, due to low rents, some owners have left their units empty, especially the cash-rich set who did not take any housing loan for their purchase. \"A vacant unit may deteriorate faster but leasing it out at a low rent may not be feasible since it will incur high maintenance costs. High-end properties have the finest finishes, so maintenance and repair costs may be hefty. Selected fit-outs and finishings such as tiles may be of limited collection and difficult to replace if it is damaged by the tenant.\"\n\nDevelopers left with unsold units, especially in the slow high-end segment, also contribute to vacancies as these projects are completed. Other factors may also be at play in specific projects. But the overall trend of rising vacancies and softening rents is clear amid climbing private home completions since last year.\n\nThe 13,150 private homes that received TOP last year was 27.3 per cent above the previous year's 10,329 and 40 per cent above the past 10-year average of 9,395. The figure for Q1 this year was 4,114 and the full-year tally is expected to hit 17,138, based on estimates submitted by developers to the Urban Redevelopment Authority. Thereafter, completions are slated to climb further to 21,738 next year and 26,252 in 2016 before easing the following year.\n\nURA figures show that the pool of vacant private homes has risen to 19,284 at end-Q1 2014 from 18,003 at end-Q4 2013 and 14,532 at end-Q1 2013. The islandwide vacancy rate rose to 6.6 per cent at end-Q1 this year from 6.2 per cent a quarter earlier and 5.2 per cent at end-Q1 2013.\n\nCBRE executive director (residential) Joseph Tan says that the latest quarter's increase could be due partly to families that had yet to move to the new homes that were completed in Q1.\n\nRising vacancies have been accompanied by softening rentals. For the first time since Q3 2009, URA's private home rental index contracted in Q4 last year. The index dipped 0.5 per cent quarter-on-quarter, followed by a further 0.7 per cent drop in Q1.\n\nCBRE predicts a 5-8 per cent drop in rents generally this year. JLL predicts a 4-8 per cent decline; Century 21's Mr Ku reckons competition for tenants will drive rents down by 8-10 per cent, followed by a further drop of up to 25 per cent in 2015.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the large supply, says DTZ's Ms Lee, some landlords could become more flexible on their rents, particularly after the removal of the vacancy tax refund with effect from Jan 1, 2014. \"Landlords now have to pay property tax on their vacant units and some may accept a lower rent and have the unit rented out instead of leaving it empty.\"\n\nThis could create downward pressure on rents.\n\nJLL's Mr Ong predicts the vacancy rate could be around 7-9 per cent at end-2014.\n\nMr Ku reckons vacancy will head towards 7.5-8 per cent mid to late next year, adding that price drops are likely to be limited to 5-10 per cent per year - assuming the economy is fine.\n\nCompetition for tenants is likely to be more intense in suburban projects, as the bulk of completions last year as well as the potential supply pipeline are in Outside Central Region (OCR). URA's Q1 rental index for non-landed private homes in OCR was down 2.3 per cent from a year ago. This compares with a decline of 0.3 per cent for Core Central Region (CCR) and a rise of one per cent in Rest of Central Region (RCR).\n\nOf the 67,507 homes under construction at end-Q1, about 59 per cent were in OCR, 22 per cent in RCR and 19 per cent in CCR. Four years earlier, of the slightly over 36,000 units under construction, the respective shares were 30, 36 and 34 per cent, notes JLL's Mr Ong. \"The heavy buying in OCR in the past few years has resulted in units under construction in this submarket surging 270 per cent over the past four years. While it is true that a high proportion of purchases in OCR is for owner-occupation, the level of investment purchases in the past few years has also been substantial.\n\n\"Based on rental contracts registered last year, OCR's share of the leasing market was about 31 per cent. Hence, the disproportionate oncoming supply may be expected to impact on this submarket more significantly.\"\n\nMs Lee, too, expects a bigger impact on rents and vacancy rates in the suburbs, \"although rental demand will still be supported by budget-conscious foreign professionals as the rental quantum for suburban condos is lower than city-fringe or prime condos\".\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

If they can be traded, the market (activity) could jump 25 per cent,\" said Mr Amri, who put the value of these bonds at some RM40 billion.\n\nBut the market needs to know the criteria for unrated bonds to be tradable, he said, noting the guidelines had yet to be released.\n\nThe criteria for 100 per cent foreign-owned international ratings agencies to operate in the Malaysian market in 2017 - this allows them to rate ringgit-denominated private debt securities - has also yet to be spelt out.\n\nMr Najib said that the unit trust industry has seen double-digit growth in the past decade, and is now Asean's largest with a net asset value of RM344 billion, or equivalent to almost a fifth of the stock market's capitalisation.\n\nLiberalising the equity shareholding of unit trust management companies would further encourage growth and competition, he added, and be in the spirit of the Asean Economic Community - a regional integration that is scheduled to take place next year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is part of Sri Lanka's US$116 million Greater Colombo Waste Water Management Project, funded by the Asian Development Bank.\n\nEarlier this year, the group announced securing other contracts totalling $7.3 million from PUB for water pipe/main laying works.\n\n\"The group has not only expanded its underground infrastructure construction services to include cable/gas pipe laying, but has also grown its footprint in overseas countries such as Brunei, China and Sri Lanka,\" said chief executive Toh Choo Huat.\n\nHeadquartered in Singapore, the underground utilities construction and road works service provider was listed in August 2012 via a reverse takeover of Ultro Technologies.\n\nFor the first quarter ended March 31, the group reported a net profit of $1 million, down about 74 per cent year on year due to higher costs, while revenue was up 23 per cent to $44.9 million.\n\nThe counter closed at 17.4 cents yesterday, down 0.1 cent, before the contract announcement.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Aurora Flight Sciences is testing echo location, a method that mimics how bats navigate in the dark, while engineers at 3D Robotics are turning to optic flow sensors, which detect objects by examining video pixels.\n\n\"Sense and avoid is one of the biggest opportunities in the industry,\" said Jesse Kallman, chief of global business development for San Francisco-based Airware, a drone-equipment maker backed by Google Ventures. \"The technology is not there yet, but it's something the industry needs badly.\"\n\nSize is the key to success and the smaller the better. Sagetech has reduced transponders, which send and receive signals on aircraft location, to the approximate dimensions of credit cards. In Alaska, a serial entrepreneur has licensed a miniature radar system, the technology considered most difficult to shrink because of the need for an antenna and a receiver.\n\nAmazon chief executive officer Jeff Bezos pushed the concept of home-delivery drones to the forefront in a Dec 1 interview on CBS's 60 Minutes, saying that Amazon plans to use small, helicopter-like aircraft to deliver packages as heavy as five pounds (2.3 kilogrammes) within a 16-kilometre radius.\n\nUS airspace regulations for drones are just starting to take shape.

The company has appointed Allenby Capital as adviser for its secondary potential listing on London's junior stock exchange, AIM. It also hopes to list on the Singapore Exchange within the next 12 to 24 months.\n\nAs for its two Reits, regulations willing, the plan is for them to be listed in as many countries as possible.\n\nTony Chan, the group managing director and elder son of Chan Heng Fai, who controls the company, said: \"So long as we can get the structure right, and the regulations allow for manageable compliance of listing in various stock exchanges, which can be quite cumbersome - if we can navigate that - we can look even beyond the usual markets.\"\n\nThe younger Mr Chan has no problems with equity dilution: \"We want dilution. We want our ownership in the Reits to drop because the Reits are growing. We are looking at doing substantial fund-raising at the Reit level.\n\n\"But if you can understand the model, we want unlimited growth for the Reits. We don't mind that our ownership drops (from the current over 90 per cent) to 10 per cent, and then five, and then one, and then half a per cent, because the larger the Reits are, the more substantial our management fee becomes.\"\n\nFear of dilution often cripples the growth potential of listed companies in which a majority shareholder is bent on maintaining his stake.\n\nHe said: \"If all we did was issue shares at the parent company's level, ultimately we would no longer be in control of the business. With this model, it doesn't happen. We are only looking at very limited fund-raising on the Heng Fai level - enough to get an interest on the AIM board and a presence in Singapore.\n\n\"By limiting our dilution at the parent company's - the Reit manager's - level, the contribution towards each shareholder grows as well, creating value for them. That's the beauty behind the business model.\"\n\nSingle-family home Reits such as AHR, a fairly recent post-financial crisis phenomenon in the US, came about after the government started rolling out programmes to sell foreclosed homes in bundles for cheap to investors and property prices plunged to levels that made rent yields alluring.\n\nAHR has acquired more than 100 suburban homes from families which have become disenchanted with home ownership or have had their credit damaged in the financial crisis. The Reit derives its income from regular rent payments. It targets a portfolio of 1,000 such homes worth US$130 million by FY15 and is focusing its efforts in \"landlord friendly\" states such as Texas, Georgia, Florida and North Carolina.\n\nGMR, the medical Reit, seeks out developers and medical practitioners looking to unlock capital from the healthcare facilities they own. It completed its first acquisition in Omaha in the state of Nebraska for US$22 million in April, and aims to achieve a net asset value of US$400 million by FY15.\n\nTwo more Reits are in the pipeline: a global property Reit with assets across sectors in the US, China, Spain and Japan, and a \"Reit of Reits\" (a Reit owning other Reits) focusing on single-purpose properties such as data centres.\n\nAsset acquisitions require money - which a Nasdaq listing and subsequent secondary listings can raise.\n\nMr Chan said: \"In the next 12 months, we hope our Reits will raise several hundred millions of US dollars and grow to be in the billion-dollar range the following year.\"\n\nWith a single Reit manager running all its Reits, Heng Fai stands to save on operational costs through economies of scale.\n\nInterestingly, Heng Fai Enterprises used to be a troubled property construction firm owned by a family whose infighting ran the business to the ground.\n\nMr Chan's father, who spent eight years buying its shares in the open market, was given a seat on the board and appointed executive director in 1992. He was later asked to take over the company when another party attempted a hostile takeover.\n\nToday, it is still a family business, with him as the visionary setting the company's macro direction, his son Tony executing these ideas, and a younger son, Moe Chan, serving as the group's chief operating officer and chief investment officer.\n\nEgo was not why the senior Mr Chan renamed the company after himself last year. He found himself getting too attached to restructuring companies and timing the market to sell them, but this one - his \"last miracle company\" - is not for sale.\n\n\"Even if the price is right, I cannot sell myself,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Last month, it consolidated ownership of its trading offices into a holding company in Singapore and appointed former head of Singapore Mercantile Exchange Thomas McMahon as its CEO.\n\n\"We feel that over the next years we'll see most of the growth coming from Singapore,\" said Mr Shah, explaining the move.\n\nLike them, many traders have moved to Singapore, boosting the number of metals and mineral players here from \"a handful\" five years ago to about 140 now, according to International Enterprise Singapore, the government agency tasked with developing the commodity sector. Revenue generated by the sector has more than doubled since 2010 to US$100 billion last year.\n\nAs the cocktail reception to launch the Singapore Mining Club showed, companies in the metals sector have moved beyond merely trading, an area that Singapore has already burnished a reputation, to other functions.\n\n\"The metals companies are starting to harness Singapore's business infrastructure by developing functions such as risk management, finance and treasury, and shipping here,\" said IE Singapore's assistant chief executive officer, Satvinder Singh.\n\nLast year, the sector spent about $3 billion on logistics and financial services, among others, in Singapore, more than double that of 2010.\n\n\"Mining companies are also looking to improve productivity and innovation in mining services, particularly in areas such as water and power solutions as well as R&D,\" Mr Singh added.\n\nThe growth of the metals sector here has dovetailed with the rise of Singapore as a pricing centre for iron ore, a major ingredient in steel-making.\n\nAs traditional annual contracts between miners and steel mills broke down in 2009, Singapore Exchange (SGX) gained a first-mover advantage by launching iron-ore swaps the same year.\n\nSGX now clears more than 90 per cent of all iron-ore derivatives globally.\n\nWith the top three iron ore miners Vale, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton - who together hold 70 per cent of seaborne iron-ore supply - moving their marketing and sales arms to Singapore in the past few years, the Republic has attracted other iron ore players.\n\n\"If you want to trade in iron ore, you must be in Singapore,\" Yang Chen, Singapore director of Shagang International - the largest privately owned steel manufacturer in China which has been here since 2008 - told The Business Times in Mandarin.\n\nAnd with iron ore often one of many products in the portfolio of metal trading houses, other traders and banks have also moved their metal trading desks to Singapore.\n\n\"It's a case of having teams in one place,\" said Jared Baker, Asia head of commodities sales at Credit Suisse. \"People don't like to have it all split up, there're compliance and supervisory issues. You benefit from having iron ore here, and if the metals business is to stay together they will move to Singapore.\"\n\nTrafigura, one of the world's largest traders of energy products and metals, moved its headquarters from Switzerland to Singapore in 2012, as did Mitsubishi Corp with its global metals headquarters that same year.\n\nTraders cite Singapore's proximity to consuming countries - in particular China, the easy availability of trade financing, and the developed insurance and freight markets as reasons for moving here.\n\nThe presence of brokers and market makers, such as Triland Metals, GFI Group, ICAP and Marex Spectron, have also enhanced the ecosystem.\n\n\"The government here is one of the few that understands the meaning of 'ecosystem' and methodically recruits all these companies to come in here and set up shop,\" said Loi Pok Yen, CEO of CWT Limited which bought over metals trading house MRI Trading in 2011.\n\n\"Once you do that, the whole sector itself takes on a life of its own. And guys like us will start to grow, because we're sitting in an area that's growing. So the pie is bigger, and there are more people who can live off that pie.\"\n\nMeanwhile, with Singapore Exchange having introduced new Mainboard listing rules for mineral, oil and gas companies last September, industry players see more small and mid-cap companies in these sectors seeking funding in the Singapore capital market.\n\nSebastian Jones, an associate director at Canaccord Genuity Singapore, observed that there are a number of mining firms looking to list on SGX.\n\n\"I think it's quite an important time for Singapore. The traditional mining exchanges in Toronto and London and Australia - there's a distinct lack of capital in those exchanges today, particularly for small to mid-cap companies who are seeking developmental capital,\" said Mr Jones, also one of the founders of the Singapore Mining Club. \"(These companies) see Singapore as a realistic alternative.\"\n\nMr Jones, who moved from London to Singapore a year ago, added: \"It's quite remarkable how much more activity there is right now in Singapore than there is in London.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Quite a few (start-ups) hide within research labs, and never really go out into the real world to meet people like us, to raise the money that is required,\" said Mr Tan, a veteran investor behind a number of start-ups in Silicon Valley, Israel, and South Korea.\n\nHe also argued that such early and immense support from the government has allowed less innovative companies to scrape by.\n\n\"Many of these Singapore companies, if they fail, they go from Incubator A to Incubator B, and if they fail again they go to Incubator C. It doesn't create opportunities for people like us, because at the end of the day, (these start-ups) continue to have that link back to the mothership. Many of them may not want to innovate, (and are) just depending on (government) grants to survive,\" argued Mr Tan, voicing a view held by other angel investors in Singapore.\n\nEdwin Chow, executive director of Spring Singapore said that although Mr Tan's point was \"well-taken\", he noted that it all depends on \"which side of the fence\" one is on.\n\nMr Chow - who was a speaker at the Roundtable event - said that from the government's point of view, \"by supporting so aggressively the individual inventor and entrepreneur . . . we have sort of encouraged more companies to form\".\n\n\"And we are beginning to see success stories,\" added Mr Chow, who oversees the government agency's Innovation and Start-ups group as well as Spring Investments.\n\nNevertheless, he conceded that going forward, the government may need to tweak its funding approaches to leverage both private and public funding in order to support burgeoning enterprises.\n\n\"Maybe for (some) sectors, we may need to adopt a slightly more nuanced approach, to perhaps pull back some of the funding, so that qualified angel investors can come forward and take on more,\" said Mr Chow, adding that in the social media and Internet space, companies are beginning to see bigger deals with private funders.\n\nBut for companies which may need more sustained support for a longer period of time - such as those in the medical technology sector - the government will \"maintain\" funding, said Mr Chow.\n\nSpeaking to BT after the event, Mr Tan said that such a fine-tuned approach would be more sustainable: \"Don't get me wrong.

Weather forecasters are increasingly predicting it will return in 2014 for the first time in five years.\n\nDuring previous El Nino patterns, the main sea freight index at London's Baltic Exchange has risen significantly. In February 2009 when El Nino appeared, the BDI was at 1,099 and it reached 2,998 in March 2010 before the phenomenon abated. From March 2006 to February 2007, it went from 2,708 to 4,765.\n\n\"Disruptions are always very favourable to the freight market/BDI,\" said Khalid Hashim, managing director of Precious Shipping, one of Thailand's largest dry cargo owners.\n\nWhile countries in Asia are scrambling to reduce El Nino's impact, shipping markets expect trade flows will be affected. Rice trade is likely to feel the effect if producers in Thailand and Vietnam are hit, shipping analysts say.\n\n\"The weather changes could lead to changes in the trades of agricultural commodities,\" said Marc Pauchet of shipbrokers ACM. \"Traditionally, South Asian rice heads for Africa and the Middle East. It is therefore those routes that would feel the brunt of potential shortfalls, and those countries may seek their rice elsewhere, in the US ... This will increase tonne-mile demand comprehensively.\"\n\nTonne miles are a key indicator of shipping demand, measuring the volume of the transported cargo multiplied by the distance of the voyage.\n\nWeather delays may also impact flows. \"Grains and other agribulks are sensitive to rain as they cannot be loaded or discharged in wet conditions. This could potentially lead to heavy congestion at ports and increase waiting times,\" said Burak Cetinok of consultancy Hartland Shipping. \"In theory, this would have a positive impact on freight rates.\"\n\nPotential shortfalls in wheat production by major exporter Australia could also boost longer-haul imports, especially for the panamax ship sector, which carries 60,000-tonne grain loads. Australia's approaching winter is likely to be warmer and drier than normal in many regions as climate models point to a developing El Nino.\n\n\"East and South-east Asian countries might look at increasing their supply from the US and Canada. The impact for shipping would be a significant boost for the panamax ships that tend to service this cargo,\" ACM's Mr Pauchet said. \"Wheat represents about 5 per cent of the volume of cargo transported by those vessels every year. Rice, on the other hand, only represents about 3 per cent of the volumes carried by handys and supras (smaller ships). There is potential for a decent boost for these assets due to El Nino.\"\n\nIndian purchases of wheat from local farmers are set to climb at least 8 per cent this year, bolstering government stocks against forecasts of below-average monsoon rains and the spectre of a possible El Nino.\n\nThe last El Nino event occurred from 2009 to 2010, and since then the Pacific has either been in a cooler state, called La Nina, or neutral. \"Looking back to 2009 we may expect drought in Australia and when that is realised by the grain market, we may see early buying of grains to compensate,\" said Jens Ismar, chief executive of shipping group Western Bulk. \"We may also see a delayed monsoon season in India that may keep up coal demand for a longer period than what is normal. Both these scenarios may benefit the market short-term.\"\n\nFor the ship container markets, which also transport refrigerated cargoes such as bananas, an El Nino is potentially less positive. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

It has accumulated a large enough stake to be able to force-buy any remaining shares it does not own when the offer closes at 5.30pm today.\n\nLast Friday, CapitaLand's stake in CMA crossed the 97.02 per cent threshold required for it to compulsorily acquire all the CMA shares it does not already own. This was a day after CapitaLand hit the 90 per cent stake threshold it needed to delist CMA.\n\nCapitaLand said yesterday that as at 5pm last Friday, shareholders holding about 15.7 per cent of CMA's issued share capital had accepted its offer to buy CMA at $2.35 a share. This brought CapitaLand's total stake in the malls unit to 97.1 per cent.\n\nCMA shareholders whose valid acceptances are received by 5.30pm today will be paid within 10 days from the date of receipt. Any remaining CMA shareholders who do not accept the offer will receive a letter from CapitaLand about the compulsory acquisition of their stock.\n\nCMA will also be suspended from trading on both the Singapore and Hong Kong bourses tomorrow, pending delisting.\n\nThis brings to a close the privatisation bid that CapitaLand first launched on April 14 at a lower offer price of $2.22.\n\nCapitaLand wanted to delist CMA - which manages 105 shopping malls worth about $34.3 billion - to simplify the group's organisational structure and make its business units more nimble in reacting to opportunities for integrated projects.\n\nBut shareholders voiced their unhappiness that the first offer price was just 4.7 per cent above CMA's initial public offering price of $2.12 when it was listed in 2009.\n\nHowever, the independent financial adviser to the deal found the offer to be \"fair and reasonable\", since CapitaLand was already CMA's majority shareholder with a 65.3 per cent stake when it launched the bid, and no change of control would result.\n\nEven so, after a closed-door discussion that the Securities Investors' Association (Singapore) (SIAS) organised between shareholders and CapitaLand's management, CapitaLand decided to better its offer, hiking the offer price to a final one of $2.35 a share.\n\nThat new price is at a 31.5 per cent premium to the last traded price on April 11 before the bid was launched, up from the 23 per cent premium implied by the initial $2.22 price.\n\nFor CapitaLand's shareholders, the deal will be immediately earnings accretive, raising its return on equity to 6.7 per cent from 5.4 per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The sort for whom nourishment comes in the form of an alcohol base topped with an assortment of sweet liquids and decorations way more advanced than a tiny umbrella.\n\nHunger pangs, if any, are sorted out with finger food or now fashionable small plates ramped up with extra salt to help you remember the difference between sweet and savoury - and make you more thirsty from the lesson.\n\nIt's also driving a wedge between the chef and bartender, as if there's only room for one star to shine in any joint - which explains the current division between the food-centric and the bar groupie, with few options where the two can have a satisfying meal/drink in the same place.\n\nSo if you avoid cocktail bars because multiple snack portions do not make a meal, or you skip restaurants because a three-course meal limits your scope for drinking beyond dessert, Sugarhall is a happy solution.\n\nFirstly, it's run by the folks behind Jigger and Pony - and is located next door to the hipster cocktail bar, if you need further liquid sustenance. So the bar part of Sugarhall is a no-brainer for them, with its many variations of rum and what you can do with it. The attraction, though, is the proper dining area set up in the deeper recesses of this narrow but long shophouse outfitted to look like a stylish wooden barn.\n\nSupposedly inspired by backyard barbecues and a fondness for rum punch, Sugarhall's menu is understandably grill-focused. For this purpose, Chef Polo Seah's stint at W Hotel's Skirt steakhouse serves him well. The food is uncomplicated but well thought out, with a few twists to keep things from getting banal.\n\nA roasted beetroot salad ($10) is light on the wallet and the tastebuds with its composition of earthy, tender tuber partnered with peppy, lightly pickled slices that add acidity, deep-fried and raw kale leaves - all pulled together with creamy mozzarella.\n\nThe unusual matching of beetroot and kale with cheese, and the satisfying crunch of fried leaves makes this a winning starter. Meanwhile, a decent-sized portion of fresh sweet tiger prawns ($18) is zi char good - generously swaddled in char-grilled aroma and the bite of Szechuan peppercorns.\n\nA sardonic sense of humour can be found in the roast spring chicken ($28), even if you don't really get the joke behind it being served with head and feet intact. Still, the brined bird is relatively moist with a comfortable salt level and a hint of herbs. The cucumber yogurt is a mismatch so skip it. The meat is good enough on its own, although we did wonder later - if the head and feet are there, how about the chicken's backside? Since we don't remember biting into that icky fat glob of a bishop's nose, we just wonder. . .\n\nWhile there are no visual surprises with the grilled pork chop ($28), we're still not convinced that a 300gm slab of meat on the bone can ever be succulent and juicy. Chef Seah does his best and serves it on the pink side, but apart from some juicy fatty bits, there's no escape from the general dryness of the cut. Still, the meat can be salvaged if you dunk it in some addictive cauliflower puree enhanced with bacon butter, capers and hazelnuts in a side dish that's main dish quality. Grilled chunks of cauliflower add heft to this star attraction ($12).\n\nDessert is limited to just tiramisu and a white chocolate yogurt ice cream ($12). The latter is essentially a sorbet made of yogurt sweetened with white chocolate, served with stewed strawberries. Alternatively, you could join your cocktail brethren and order a Muay Thai punch - a rum and milk tea concoction, which, at $22, costs more than dessert. But unlike a conventional restaurant, nobody will blink an eye if you decide to nurse this dessert right through till midnight.\n\nThe food may still be a little rough around the edges and could do with a bit more ambition, but Sugarhall's got the bar-dining formula down pat. Why settle for a bird in hand when you can get both in the bush?\n\njaime@sph.com.sg\n\n@JaimeEeBT\n\nRating:\n\n6.5\n\nWHAT OUR RATINGS MEAN\n\n10: The ultimate dining experience\n\n9-9.5: Sublime\n\n8-8.5: Excellent\n\n7-7.5: Good to very good\n\n6-6.5: Promising\n\n5-5.5: Average\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They could potentially fork out another $80.7 million to extend the sales period for another year if they do not sell their inventory by year-end, according to a study by OrangeTee Research.\n\n\"As the penalty amounts to millions of dollars per project, we believe that it will incentivise some developers to reprice some of these projects to move sales in the near term,\" said OrangeTee research head Christine Li.\n\nA total of 24 condo projects, mostly high-end ones, are still not fully sold two years after receiving their temporary occupation permits (TOPs) between 2010 and 2012, the study showed. Under the government's Qualifying Certificate (QC) rules, developers have to pay extension charges to extend the sales period after two years of the project's TOP.\n\nAll developers with non-Singaporean shareholders or directors need to obtain QCs to buy private land for new projects because they are deemed \"foreign developers\" under the Residential Property Act (RPA). This means the QC rules apply to all listed developers. Privately owned Far East Organization and Hoi Hup are among the few developers exempted from the rules.\n\nGiven that the QCs allow developers up to five years to finish building a project and two more years to sell all the units, the heat is on developers to clear their stock by the deadline.\n\nTo extend the sales period, developers pay 8 per cent of the land purchase price for the first year of extension, 16 per cent for the second year and 24 per cent from the third year onwards. The charges are pro-rated based on unsold units over the total units in the project.\n\nSuch fees drove luxury residential player SC Global to delist from the Singapore Exchange last year after sales slowed significantly due to the government's property cooling measures.\n\nAnalysts warn that more extension charges will kick in. The charges paid up so far are just the tip of the iceberg as projects built from land acquired during the 2006-2007 en bloc fever have just crossed a seven-year mark, they say.\n\n\"More developers are caught between a rock and a hard place\" as they have to decide whether to pay the extension charges or cut prices to move the units, said SLP International executive director Nicholas Mak.\n\nIf they pay for extension charges, there is also the question of whether they can recover these costs later on, he said. This is why some developers of luxury projects are resorting to selling the units in bulk to mega investors.\n\nOrangeTee's study of the 24 projects excluded three projects whose land costs could not be determined. It tracked sales of projects through caveats lodged, which it conceded could be lower than actual sales.\n\nAt the end of the first quarter of this year, there were 10,295 unsold units in the Core Central Region (CCR), 8,089 in the Rest of Central Region (RCR) and 12,433 in the Outside Central Region (OCR).\n\nBased on URA caveats, there are 71 unsold units in Wheelock Properties' Scotts Square that TOP-ed in 2011 and 16 unsold units in Wing Tai's Helios Residences, which also TOP-ed in the same year.\n\n\"As unsold inventory builds up, there will likely be more bargains in the market if developers want to avoid paying penalties to extend the sales period, especially high-end developers who have already paid premium prices for their lands,\" Ms Li said.\n\nThe study excluded the fees that developers need to pay to extend the completion of projects beyond five years, as they can typically extend without paying the charges \"based on technicalities\".\n\nEven in a more optimistic scenario where developers manage to sell 20 per cent of the remaining units for the rest of this year, further extension charges to be paid by developers by end-2014 will amount to around $68.3 million.\n\nSome market watchers noted that the QC rules should mark a distinction between larger and smaller projects, given that it takes a longer time to move all the units in large projects in a difficult market as the current one.\n\nCentury21 chief executive officer Ku Swee Yong said that demand for high-end projects had been hit hardest by higher additional buyers' stamp duty (ABSD) since January 2013 and a borrowing cap under the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) since June last year.\n\nEven if a developer decides to set up an investment company to buy the units and rent them out, the company could be hit by a 15 per cent ABSD and is restricted by a loan-to-value limit of 20 per cent.\n\nWhile there is good reason for having QC rules to regulate foreign participation in the housing market, these rules were in place before the ABSD and TDSR. \"It is about time we review these measures,\" Mr Ku said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Jaime Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 6, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nI ATE a bear. Sorry. I didn't mean to. It was a weird case of what happens when: a) you're greedy; b) do not question three Michelin-starred Japanese chefs who tell you about a mind-blowing meal to be had in an obscure mountain location outside Kyoto; c) do not speak Japanese; d) mistake cute bear cartoons to mean that tea sessions can be organised with friendly neighbourhood grizzlies.\n\nOur bizarre eating experience begins at Kyoto station, where a one-hour ride with the first unfriendly Japanese taxi-driver we've come across takes us on a slow route through bad traffic and the winding mountain roads of Shiga prefecture before we finally reach Kuzukawa valley, near the capital city of Otsu. In the middle of nowhere, he suddenly pulls up in front of a random, weather-beaten old wooden house, cleans us out of some 12,000 yen (it's usually around 7,000 yen), dismisses us with a jaunty Ja Ne (Bye) and speeds off, leaving us to our own devices.\n\n\"Hirasansou?\" We hesitantly ask the lady who opens the door with a broad welcoming smile and reassuring Hai!Dozo!\n\nWe were already warned that the accomodation at Hirasansou ryokan would be basic. And it is. The rooms are spacious if spartan, and have no locks (but no one walks past anyway). There's one communal shower (scrupulously clean) and no central heating (it's May but the room is freezing and we don't know how to say \"heater\"). But we're bowled over by the consummate hospitality shown by the staff, who do all they can despite their near non-existent English to make us feel at home.\n\nThe simple countryside inn spans three generations, run currently by Ito Takeji - grandson of the original ryokan owner - and his wife Yukiko. Once you get your bearings right, you can see why the place is so well-patronised. It sits smack within a vast mountain range with lush vegetation and ample hiking trails - proof of that being the morning sight of local trekkers armed with backpacks and poles marching past below your window before you've even ventured downstairs for breakfast.\n\nPick of wild greens\n\nMountains. Rivers. Forests. With such rich flora and fauna in his backyard, Takeji-san literally has his pick of the best produce, so it's clear why the culinary elite head out to his neck of the woods, literally. Considering that Kyoto vegetables are the cream of the crop in Japan - even justifying its own label, kyo yasai - Hirasansou goes even further with its pick of wild greens.\n\nFish variety is one thing they don't have, since the region is surrounded by the large Lake Biwa, but in the spring, the waters are flush with fat ayu - sweet, succulent finger-length specimens with their trademark bitter stomach that is an acquired taste - and local carp.\n\nYou know that food is the star at Hirasansou because the best view is reserved for the dining room, which looks out into a postcard-perfect garden view - complete with koi pond - that could even rival that of three-starred Kitcho in Kyoto's Arashiyama. And - the room is heated. Do not expect a meal of haute kaiseki proportions, though. You're looking at pristine ingredients, minimally prepared to showcase the natural flavours.\n\nWe kick off with a plate of delicate tempura - airy, crisp batter surrounding wild vegetables - a chunky, meaty, asparagus-like stem as well as dainty, flower-shaped leaf clusters. Following up is an appetiser presentation of cold, cooked baby fish, shrimp and vegetables seasoned in varying degrees of soya sauce and vinegar.\n\nA sashimi platter is composed of what's available locally - pale, curled boiled unagi, raw slices of carp with its distinctive freshwater flavour and minuscule bones and the surprise hit that is raw deer meat or shika. If you've been conned into eating horsemeat sashimi before and secretly liked it, this is similar - like very rich, marbled, meaty tuna with a silky bite. If you're a fan of ayu - it's hard to get anything better than these grilled morsels of delicate sweet flesh. The bitter innards, though, are a different matter.\n\nWhen our server starts to assemble a charcoal stove at our table, a dim, distant memory suddenly clicks in our heads. A vague mention by our Tokyo chef friends about bear hotpot, a very rare delicacy that's really hard to find in Japan . . .\n\nTakeji-san himself places the plate of immaculately sliced squares of glistening deep-red meat matched with an equal layer of pure white fat, looking like a luxurious display of top-quality jamon iberico bellota. The affable, almost bear-sized owner-chef motions to his chest to indicate the cut of meat - the best part.\n\nFrom what we gather, bears are indigenous to Shiga, and taste the best just before they go into hibernation, when they've been eating to fatten themselves for the winter and which accounts for the thick layer of fat which is sweet, nutty and not oily at all.\n\nThey're not a protected species, and professional hunters are good enough to fell the bear with a single shot - to ensure the integrity of the meat. You don't get bear meat all the time at Hirasansou, especially this cut. We subsequently find out from our chef friends that they didn't get any bear hotpot the last time they were there. You have to go at the right time, and in this case, we apparently lucked out. Right.\n\nBear meat has to be cooked properly or it can cause trichinosis, a parasitic disease. Hence, Takeji-san personally cooks it at the table - swirling it in boiling dashi stock sweetened with soy and mirin, with a spicy kick from the sansho flowers that speckle the stock.\n\nBig game trail\n\nYam, bamboo shoots and sansho leaves are also added to the stock to simmer, and the cooked meat is ladled into a bowl with the root vegetables and sansho. The flavour is hard to describe - it's surprisingly not gamey, slightly chewy from being well-cooked, and tastes like a cross between beef and duck. The fat is clean, with no oily aftertaste. It tastes infinitely better than game meat, if we can shake off our guilt and mental images of cute cuddly bears, that is.\n\nWeird food moment aside, follow-up courses such as simmered fiddlehead fern and whitebait, milky miso soup made with carp, and exquisite fresh peas cooked in plain rice seal Hirasansou's appeal as a destination dining adventure.\n\nIt's a pricey side trip for sure - expect to pay 35,000 yen (S$430) per person which includes a night's stay, dinner and breakfast. That's not even factoring in the cab fare from Kyoto. But as an experience in itself, it's one of those things you have to do just once. If we do go back, it'll be for the nature trails and the wild vegetation. And if we meet a bear, it will be from a safe viewing distance, or hopefully in a pleasant afternoon tea session. So long as he is not an ingredient in the sandwich filling.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 6, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nMAYBE it's a reflection of how dynamic the Ghibli is. Three generations of this Maserati may share the same nameplate but not the same styling. The first Ghibli was a sensuously styled two-door grand tourer launched in 1967, while the second was a boxy bruiser of a coupe that appeared in 1992. Now, for the 21st century, the Ghibli gets four doors and is aimed smartly at the luxury sedan segment.\n\nWith its gaping grille and menacing headlamps, the Ghibli looks like a shorter version of the Quattroporte. It is, sort of. But unlike the QP which also has a V8, the Ghibli is available with only a 3.0-litre twin-turbo V6 engine that is designed and owned by Maserati but produced by Ferrari. It drives the rear wheels via an eight-speed ZF automatic transmission and there are two variants - the Ghibli with 330 hp and the Ghibli S with 410 hp.\n\nThe latter produces a massive 550 Nm of torque, which is available from just 1,750 rpm in overboost. This means the Ghibli S is wonderfully responsive despite weighing in at 1,810 kg. With 50:50 weight distribution, the Ghibli is balanced. Its neutral handling in corners also benefits from the steel-aluminium-magnesium construction of the body, which endows the Ghibli with a low centre of gravity.\n\nThe thick-rimmed leather steering wheel with its precise and well-weighted steering is reassuring at high speed, and the Ghibli S feels remarkably agile for a car that is five metres long.\n\nThe fixed rate dampers are a good compromise between ride comfort and sporty handling but pressing the Sport button on the lower centre console can make the Ghibli S more aggressive with a more responsive engine and gearbox. A pair of exhaust flaps also open to amp up the sound to delightful levels.\n\nBut perhaps the most interesting aspect about this Maserati sedan is how German it feels, from the reassuringly confident steering, to the smoothness of the ride. The cabin may be swathed in fine Italian leather but the tactile feedback of the buttons and switches, along with the clarity of the instruments and 8.4-inch touchscreen, lend an air of robustness and reliability not obvious in earlier Maseratis. Its 2,998 mm wheelbase also means good rear legroom and that makes it suitable for daily use.\n\nThere is much to like about the Ghibli S - the directness of its steering, the perfect seating position even for taller drivers, the smooth silky power and, of course, that delicious exhaust backfire.\n\nIt is not a car that you will use for track day; it wasn't designed for it. Rather, it will offer long-distance comfort with its supple ride as it attacks B-roads enthusiastically. As a self-drive option, the Maserati Ghibli S has to be the ideal synthesis of style, performance and luxury.\n\nsamuelee@sph.com.sg\n\nSPECS\n\nMaserati Ghibli S\n\nEngine\n\n2,979cc V6 turbocharged\n\nTransmission\n\n8-speed auto\n\nMax power\n\n410 hp @ 5,500 rpm\n\nMax torque\n\n550 Nm @ 4,500-5,000 rpm\n\n0-100 kmh\n\n5.0 secs\n\nTop speed\n\n285 kmh\n\nCO2 emissions\n\n242 g/km\n\nAverage OMV\n\n$100,000\n\nPrice\n\n$390,000 (w/o COE)\n\nDistributor\n\nHong Seh Motors\n\nTel\n\n6266 1555\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Imports fell 1.6 per cent. The trade surplus widened to US$35.92 billion.\n\nStronger exports may bolster Chinese leaders' confidence that a recovery in demand from the US and Europe will support economic growth and reduce pressure on the government to counter domestic weakness with stronger stimulus as the property market slumps. The European Central Bank's unprecedented easing last week is a welcome step for China that should help export growth, World Bank economist Karlis Smits said on Friday.\n\n\"The export figures are positive news for policymakers and we expect continued solid export growth in the coming months amid gradually improving global demand momentum,\" said Louis Kuijs, chief China economist at Royal Bank of Scotland in Hong Kong. \"The import data suggest a pretty subdued state of the domestic economy though and the dilemma for the government is how to balance the need to reduce growth in leverage with all the calls for support.\"\n\nThe government has announced a series of targeted policies to support the economy after growth slowed to 7.4 per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier, the weakest pace since 2012 and below the government's full-year goal of about 7.5 per cent.\n\nMeasures have included help for exporters, tax cuts, speeding up investment in public housing and infrastructure, faster fiscal spending and a reduction in reserve requirements for some banks to spur lending to targeted sectors.\n\n\"Improving exports reduce the downside risks to growth, making broad-based stimulus less likely,\" said Ding Shuang, senior China economist at Citigroup in Hong Kong.\n\nChina's trade data have been distorted this year after figures in early 2013 were inflated by falsified invoices used to disguise capital flows. That triggered a government crackdown on the practice and led to a slump in year-over-year export growth last month of that year to 0.9 per cent from 14.6 per cent in April.\n\nTrade numbers for last month probably marked the first set of \"clean\" data free of the impact of distortions, according to RBS's Mr Kuijs.\n\nIn the US, China's biggest export market, hiring increased by more than 200,000 for the fourth consecutive month in May and service industries expanded at the fastest pace in nine months, reports showed last week, signalling a broad-based rebound in the economy.\n\nThe increase in exports last month followed an unexpected gain of 0.9 per cent in April after two months of declines. Estimates of 43 analysts ranged from a drop of 1.8 per cent to a gain of 10.4 per cent.\n\nChina's steel exports have surged amid a domestic operating environment that Baoshan Iron & Steel Co chairman He Wenbo said in April is the harshest ever. Overseas shipments by Tangshan Iron and Steel Co surged 35.5 per cent in April from a year earlier and rose 39 per cent in the first quarter, data from its parent Hebei Iron and Steel Co show.\n\nThe fall in imports may be partly due to the government's investigation into metal financing in China and to the lag in import orders made a couple of months ago when the economy slowed sharply, said Larry Hu, head of China economics at Macquarie Securities in Hong Kong. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Cybercriminals take advantage of people's desire to get a good deal by bundling malware with legitimate programs such as software, videos or music downloaded online.\n\n\"Typically, these downloads are from untrusted sites and come with enticing offers,\" Tim Rains, Microsoft director for trustworthy computing, tells BizIT. \"This has become an increasingly common tactic for cybercriminals and a problem that is global in scope. Deceptive downloads were a top threat in 105 out of 110 countries/regions worldwide that we studied and was encountered by more than six out of every 100 systems worldwide in the fourth quarter of 2013.\"\n\nAccording to him, the top three deceptive downloads threats in Singapore are:\n\nMr Rains notes that as a result of advances in software security, making successful attacks more difficult and cost prohibitive, cybercriminals are increasingly turning towards a variety of deceptive tactics for malicious purposes such as stealing people's personal and financial information. \"While cybercriminals using deceptive tactics isn't new, it has dramatically increased in the second half of 2013. Computers that had to be disinfected as a result of deceptive tactics more than tripled in the last quarter of 2013.\n\n\"As shown from the data, cybercriminals are increasingly tricking people into installing malware by packaging it with legitimate content downloaded online. Deceptive downloads were a top threat for 95 per cent of the 110 countries/regions studied, including Singapore.\"\n\nWhile deceptive downloads are increasingly common, their impact is not often seen right away. The victim may simply notice their computer slow down or may see unexpected search results in their browser. For example, you may be searching for details on the latest episode of your favourite TV show, but your compromised machine keeps returning search results for counterfeit prescription drugs. The effects of deceptive downloads may not be realised immediately, but can have long term impact.\n\n\"Thus the trends revealed in the latest version of SIR reinforces the importance of taking extra caution with what you download - in bundles or by itself,\" Mr Rains says.\n\nThe SIR also shows that the proportion of malware attacks in Singapore was fairly lower than for the rest of the world in the last quarter of last year - 12.3 per cent compared with 21.6 per cent. In addition, Microsoft's malicious software removal tool detected and removed malware from nine out of every 1,000 unique computers scanned in Singapore. Globally, the rate was 17.8 out of every 1,000 computers.\n\nMr Rains says that these numbers highlight the fact that organisations and individual computer users are \"generally 'safer' than most of the world\". He adds that there could be many reasons for this, including greater awareness in Singapore of cyber-threats.\n\nThe SIR analyses and provides in-depth perspectives on exploits, vulnerabilities, and malware based on data from more than a billion systems worldwide and some of the busiest online services.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This led SingHaiyi to record an impairment of $10.5 million for FY2014 after the company compared its sales and selling prices to other projects in the vicinity.\n\nIn a recent interview, SingHaiyi's management told The Business Times that more than just diversifying out of residential projects into the more resilient commercial space - evident from its taking of a 20 per cent stake in TripleOne Somerset earlier this year - the Catalist-quoted real estate firm is increasingly focusing on purchasing distressed properties in the US.\n\nFor FY2014, SingHaiyi's US operations accounted for $11.8 million (versus nothing for FY2013) or one-fifth of the group's revenue, mainly from the sale of units at its Vietnam Town commercial condominium in San Jose, California, as well as rental revenue from its Tri-County Mall in Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nBoth of these are troubled assets acquired at huge discounts to their net book values through a sister company, American Pacific International Capital (Apic), which is owned by the controlling shareholders of SingHaiyi, Gordon Tang and his wife, Serena Chen.\n\nThe third and latest acquisition is the one the team is most excited about: a half-occupied office building sitting on 4.7 acres (204,300 square feet) of prime waterfront land along San Francisco Bay that will be demolished to make way for a high-end community for seniors.\n\nChairman Neil Bush, son and brother to two former US presidents, said: \"There is a very clear trend for the continuing care retirement community concept in the US. I'm really excited about the low supply and high demand as the senior population from the baby-boomer generation grows in size. It's very affordable for people who have homes to sell their homes and buy this concept, so we get the benefit of the upfront entrance fee plus recurring income from their stay.\"\n\nThis housing concept for the elderly, although not common in Singapore, is a mature one in the US, having been around since the 1970s. Residents pay US$3,500 to US$7,500 monthly to live in a unit there, depending on the level of care they need.\n\nAsked if troubled assets make wise acquisition targets given the effort needed to clean them up, Ms Chen, who is also group managing director, replied in Mandarin: \"We are picking them up cheap, but these are not rubbish, these are projects with potential. We're very careful in our selection, that's why we've only picked three so far, despite having looked at 40 projects.\"\n\nIt will take some time but stable recurring income from these new acquisitions are expected to shake up the current US-to-Singapore's 20:80 revenue ratio over the next few years.\n\nOf the US$180 million SingHaiyi raised last June to grow its US real estate portfolio, it still has about US$80 million left to deploy.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These days, the hacks carried out on the financial industry, for example, are different from those committed against retail businesses.\n\nThe intrusion method of choice for the financial industry is via websites; for retail businesses, the preferred way in is via the point-of-sale system.\n\nWeb app attacks are most often performed on finance, IT, trade and utilities companies; the mining, transportation and manufacturing industries are hot targets for cyber espionage, but spying makes up less than one per cent of attacks on finance and retail verticals.\n\nThis information is from a recent global study from Verizon Enterprise Solutions, said its head of managed identity and security solutions for the Asia-Pacific, Rob Parker.\n\nThe other piece of bad news the Verizon study uncovered is that attackers are working faster, but the time between the intrusion and the discovery of the breach has stayed relatively stagnant.\n\n\"The point is, the bad guys are innovating faster than the good guys. That's not encouraging,\" said Mr Parker.\n\nAttackers are getting more savvy, and are focusing their campaigns to raise the chances of a successful break-in, compared with the past, he added.\n\nWeb attacks come in various forms, so industries more exposed to a certain type of attack could dedicate more resources to putting up more defences in that area, said Mr Parker.\n\nAttackers can choose to target the building blocks of a website - from breaking into the server on the backend to intercepting data transmitted between the frontend and backend application.\n\nPhishing, through which hackers try to trick users into revealing their credentials, continues to be a common attack method.\n\nThe Verizon report said: \"Many attacks in 2013 targeted off-the-shelf (Web) content-management systems to gain control of servers.\"\n\nDenial-of-service (DoS) attacks, generally carried out on the victim's servers, were popular last year. Attackers typically overload the servers with requests, causing them to go down, temporarily incapacitating the operations of the business.\n\nIndustries that suffer from DoS attacks could consider engaging a managed-service provider; third-party providers tend to have more robust, distributed resources that can withstand larger attacks, said Mr Parker.\n\nIndustries could also shift some resources to the cloud.\n\nFor companies which rely heavily on Web apps to serve customers, Verizon recommends that they monitor outgoing connections to identify suspicious behaviour. They should also restrict multiple log-ins within a short timeframe and invest in two-step authentication systems.\n\nThe study also found that intrusions coming through user devices have been growing over time, because these have offered an easy foot in the door. Although most intrusions come in through servers, the central storehouse of information, user devices such as smartphones, tablets and computers have overtaken kiosks in terms of the devices of choice for interacting with banks. As a result, more financial services firms have come to rely on them to reach users.\n\nStuart Christmas, the director of future technologies at Tigerspike, said that the company is seeing a huge rise in the need for mobile security, although actual take-up lags behind that.\n\nThe global personal media company produces apps for enterprise clients, which have included Shell, The Economist and Woolworths.\n\n\"Companies pay a lot of lip service to being dedicated to security and privacy, but are typically unwilling to take action. Security in general tends to be something you 'need' only when it's too late,\" he said.\n\nThis security lag is larger with mobile apps than with traditional software, and the banking industry is leading the way with mobile security, he added.\n\nTypical attacks on apps tend to exploit weaknesses in crypto-algorithms, with attacks attempting to sniff out data transferred between app and server.\n\nMost apps use third-party libraries, which can introduce layers of insecurity to the final product. \"If you know what they are, it's not hard to know how to steal from the backend systems,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Any gains made are returned to investors in the fund. But Internet companies such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Baidu Inc and Tencent Holdings Ltd continued to grow strongly long after private equity firms sold their stakes.\n\nAn evergreen fund would allow Capital Today to hold stakes in emerging Chinese companies for far longer than is usual, enabling the firm to share in future profits, according to an investor familiar with plans for the new fund.\n\nThe new fund, Capital Today Evergreen Fund, will charge a regular 2 per cent management fee, but will have a 28-year life, according to the term sheet. That is likely to appeal to investors who are comfortable investing over a long period, such as US endowment funds or family offices.\n\nCapital Today's evergreen fund comes off the back of a series of lucrative investments. Bets on Chinese technology companies in particular have earned big payouts for the firm's investors, which include International Finance Corp and CDC Group PLC, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n\nThe new fund is widely believed to be the first of its kind in China, and comes with the firm sitting on a windfall from its stake in JD.com. Other Capital Today interests include web-based broadcaster China Central Television, video sharing site Tudou.com, and logistics and distribution company Shandong Rongqing Logistics Co Ltd.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/bonds-stocks-get-ecb-boost-euro-unfazed", "site_title": "Bonds, stocks get ECB boost; euro unfazed", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nBonds, stocks get ECB boost; euro unfazed\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 6, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE big question is whether European Central Bank (ECB) chief Mario Draghi's monetary bullets will be a shot in the arm for the sclerotic eurozone economies.\n\nNegative interest rates and a 400 billion euro (S$684 billion) cheap central bank facility aimed at boosting business lending lifted equity and bond prices slightly, but the shotgun fired blanks at the euro.\n\nAfter falling to a five-month low of 1.35 against the US dollar, the euro rebounded to around 1.365 on the back of short-covering from hedge funds, which had built a substantial bear position against the currency.\n\nRegardless of short-term market reactions, however, the ECB regards the current foreign exchange rate as uncomfortably high. In central bank-couched language, ECB officials hinted broadly that a devaluation of up to 10 per cent would boost exports and reduce imports of low-priced goods, which are causing disinflation and the possibility of a deflation downward spiral, leading to business and consumer-spending delays and a slide towards recession.\n\nAs the table shows, the economies of Italy, Ireland and Greece are still contracting; those of France and Spain are teetering on the brink of recession.\n\nOnly Germany has been spurting ahead, but with a sizeable proportion of its exports geared towards the uncertain economies of China and other Asian and emerging markets, the most powerful European nation is in danger of slowing down. Illustrating the dependence on a weaker euro to stimulate foreign sales, the German stock market DAX index surged to an all-time peak of 10,000 when the currency dipped to its lows and then slipped back when the currency rallied.\n\nFrance, Italy, Spain and other eurozone members are even more desperate for euro devaluation, hoping that it will fall towards the currency's purchasing power parity (trade valuation) of around 1.18 to the US dollar.\n\nThe currency over-valuation against Asia-Pacific currencies is even more extensive. Since 2012, the euro has appreciated by 12 per cent against the Singapore dollar, a relatively strong currency in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nSteven Barrow of Standard Bank and other currency analysts said that, in the generally unpredictable foreign exchange market, the euro could decline to around 1.27 in a year and 1.20 in two years. But they do not believe that such a decline would be sufficient to counter deflationary threats.\n\nIn 2012, Mr Draghi set European financial markets alight by stating that the ECB would protect the euro at all costs. The result has been a sharp decline in government bond yields and soaring European stock markets.\n\nThe advantages of Mr Draghi's \"jawboning\" has been much cheaper borrowing for governments and finance for cash-strapped companies.\n\nThe eurozone economies have recovered from their 2011 to 2012 crisis nadirs, but with the exception of Germany and, to a lesser extent, France, these economies' gross national products are well below levels seen six years ago, before the global financial collapse.\n\nSome monetary measures to boost the eurozone economies have received mixed reviews from economists.\n\nThe ECB cut its three key interest rates, but the most widely expected was a decision to set a negative interest rate on the ECB's deposit facility. The aim of this measure, which effectively requires banks to pay the ECB for excess deposits, is to encourage them to lend more. Analysts believe this could work, given that the measure comes into effect almost immediately.\n\nAnother incentive is a four-year 400 billion euro targeted long-term refinancing operation (TLTRO) scheme, under which banks will be able to borrow from the ECB at exceptionally low interest rates, on condition these funds are then lent out to the private sector - largely to companies. Analysts fear this measure, which is not massive given the lengthy period, only comes into operation from September. The eurozone cannot afford any delays, they warn.\n\nThe ECB also intends to create a transparent asset-backed securities (ABS) market. This measure, which would kick in if the latest policy fails, will enable the ECB to eventually purchase assets of banks and other institutions, cutting yields and boosting liquidity in the eurozone economy. This measure will not have any impact until the ECB buys.\n\nIf the measures fail, Mr Draghi has promised a major quantitative easing (QE) programme to boost liquidity, similarly to that of the US Federal Reserve Board.\n\nThe danger of all the monetary ease and QE is the creation of bond, share and property bubbles that could burst, causing another financial collapse and recession. This is the problem that the US Fed also faces and it has raised global uncertainty.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/era-slow-fashion", "site_title": "Era of slow fashion", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nEra of slow fashion\n\nA new breed of socially responsible designer and retailer places a premium on the painstaking process of fashion creation rather than being driven by profits or the latest fad. By May Yip\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 6, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nOVER a year after the Rana Plaza disaster, during which the collapse of the factory building in Bangladesh killed over 1,300 people, intricately made apparel with traceable origins has become more appealing to consumers with a conscience. Now, despite the continuing demand for $10 tank tops to don and dump, the notion of buying a $200 scarf that took four days to handcraft isn't quite as foreign as the ingestion of chia seeds to a McDonald's devotee.\n\n\"Because we are so used to mass-produced goods at affordable prices, consumers often neglect to recognise that someone else is actually trading their own precious time and effort to physically create a product,\" says Colin Chen, co-founder of Tyrwhitt General Company.\n\n\"We decided to focus on artisanal and crafted goods because we believe that there is more to buying than just the physical transaction and ownership. Consumers have a right to know how the goods came about, the story of the makers behind the goods, why they are doing it and even the social impact of production.\"\n\nBack to the source\n\nEstablished in late-2012, Mr Chen's retail store located above Chye Seng Huat Hardware cafe attempts to support artisanal labels, many of which are local. Perhaps a counter-movement in reaction to the environmental and social evils of fast fashion, several independent retailers and designers are pivoting their attention from maximising profit margins to sourcing for reliable creators of quality wares.\n\nCase in point: Apart from committing to much lengthier, artisanal modes of production, \"socially motivated\" brand Matter relies on craftsmen personally sought out by its founder Renyung Ho to ensure its products are ethically created and of a high quality.\n\n\"It kicked off last year when I drove a tuk-tuk covering 3,000 km from North to South India for a charity drive,\" recalls Ms Ho, a former associate director at Banyan Tree Hotels & Resorts.\n\n\"I fell in love with the country and met some key people I work with now. It was sort of a domino effect. Each of our supply chain partners is chosen through a set of criteria emphasising product integrity, community integration and good business practice. We personally visit each partner to establish that long-term relationship.\"\n\nBesides relying on socially responsible manufacturers, some homegrown designers such as scarf-maker Linda Solay, a Singapore-based Swedish designer who creates \"nuno-felted\" scarves, personally craft each product they sell. Relatively time-consuming and completely bucking the trend of high volume fashion production, these designers give new meaning to the notion of a \"hands-on approach\" to business.\n\nFor now, Ms Solay, who moved to Singapore to pursue a master's degree in fine art, makes every scarf herself by hand, from selecting the wools and silks, to laying out a design; rolling, shaping, detailing; and labelling and packaging. It takes from 10 hours for a scarf of regular size and complexity, to over four days for a larger scarf or shawl with detailing.\n\nThe manual felting process also involves laboriously applying water to slowly interlock wool fibres with a fine silk base. Hence, plans to start training and employing a couple of dedicated staff with a keen eye for detail are under way.\n\n\"At a time when anything can be purchased with money, appreciation for the slow and genuine craft form is being revived, not the least because it allows to further have a piece custom-made according to one's wishes,\" says the artist, who recently held a nuno felting workshop here, and adds that half her sales come from local customers.\n\nLikewise, it takes 80 days to make a pair of Matter pants - about a month for the fabric to be woven, another month for printing, and 20 days to cut and stitch. Weaving and printing require more time as the fabrics are hand-woven and the silk-cotton blend used comes directly from only one supplier; block printing, on the other hand, involves multiple steps where the production process is highly dependent on weather conditions.\n\n\"We see the rise of the 'maker culture' and indie labels. There's a definite growth in the demand and valuation of buying local,\" says Ms Ho, who co-founded a collaborative workspace for creative entrepreneurs called Kennel prior to kick-starting the apparel company, which currently retails a line of trousers for women and dwells on provenance and quality. \"Singaporean shoppers, however, still prioritise affordability and convenience. And although conscious consumerism is on the rise, businesses still have to ensure they can provide that.\"\n\nPricing craftsmanship\n\nWhile the majority of shoppers may pay stratospheric prices for the perceived value of a designer product, they may still baulk at shelling out for relatively unknown labels - especially if they are local. Which is why Tyrwhitt General Company manages a blog to showcase its designers as well as holds regular workshops to introduce old-school skills such as leathercraft and box-making to educate customers on the effort that goes behind a handmade object.\n\n\"When you can find a decent pair of Oxfords in, say, H&M for $80, you will find it shocking to see another pair costing $400,\" says Mr Chen, who also helms accessories brands Fabrix and Miller Goods.\n\n\"We've just held a series of shoe-making workshops during which participants handcrafted a pair of slip-on leather shoes from scratch. It took each participant nearly 10 hours just to complete a very simplified pair. Most of them have a newfound respect for shoe-makers now.\"\n\nFor some designers, the act of personally creating products is not just an outlet for creative expression, it stems from a desire to shift consumers' pursuit of cheap and instant gratification. Founded by sisters Paige, a former primary school teacher and marketing officer, and Lynette Lee, a fresh graduate, two-year-old homegrown label 30Versions features only accessories handmade by its owners in a home studio. The duo describes their designs as \"art wearables\" rather than mere jewellery, and, indeed, pieces such as a silver necklace embellished with pyrite - a type of mineral - have an almost sculptural quality.\n\n\"It'll take more than just awareness to alter the mindsets of people who are more inclined to follow trends and pay for lower-quality, fast fashion products,\" admits Paige.\n\n\"We believe that brands like us are generally spurred on by a different motive as opposed to fast-fashion producers. We create with a purpose in mind, hoping to either share our love of well-designed goods or spread a certain message to people through our designs. Profits are not our main source of motivation.\"\n\nShopping subculture\n\nWith the convenience of online shopping and ubiquity of cookie-cutter styles from massive fashion chains, our national obsession with shopping has ironically spawned an aversion towards mass consumption.\n\n\"Indeed, the fast-paced life and mass consumerist patterns of Singaporean have indirectly spun off another subculture of individuals seeking to break free from the homogeneity,\" mulls Mr Chen.\n\n\"In a way, everyone wants to be unique and special, down to their personal styles and things they own. Hence they seek options by crafters and makers that resonate with their own individuality. In a way, it's all about going back to basics and back to the roots.\"\n\nJust like how some gourmands who crave a connection to their sustenance have turned to foraging to determine the precise source of ingredients for dinner - Sengkang Riverside Park is apparently a frequent haunt of such \"locavores\", serious shoppers want to be clued in on the origins of their purchases.\n\nApart from learning how to make their own shoes, they would perhaps shop at flea markets such as MAAD to engage in a conversation with the makers of a necklace they wish to buy, or visit online shopping portals such as Haystackt which curates a group of indie creators and offer some insights into their work processes.\n\n\"With the rise of conscious consumerism, even the fast-fashion industry knows that their model of fast, disposable fashion is no longer the way forward. H&M's Conscious Collection is a great example of a fast-fashion giant moving in a different direction,\" says Ms Ho.\n\n\"Our label isn't just a place for people to buy pants; it's about understanding where a great product is made and by whom it's made.

Trading houses and banks have sent executives to the port to physically check on their exposure, while some banks have stopped new metal financing to some clients in China.\n\nJeremy Goldwyn, a director at brokerage Sucden Financial, said that some customers at the port were likely to ship metal out to more regulated London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses \"in a classic flight to quality\". \"Indeed, we hear metal is already en route to Korean LME locations,\" added Mr Goldwyn. The LME licenses warehouses all around the world including in South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan in Asia, but is not permitted to have warehouses in China.\n\nTraders said that holders of copper in Qingdao that were having difficulty obtaining finance could also be forced to deliver to LME warehouses in East Asia to raise capital.\n\nShips carrying 10,000-20,000 tonnes of copper from Qingdao would arrive in South Korea over the coming weeks, one physical trader in Singapore estimated.\n\nMost metal financing deals in China are done outside exchanges, and in those deals warehouse receipts are used as proof of ownership of metal. This is agreed typically by a bank or a trading house with a warehouse.\n\nIn contrast, in some other developed financial centres there is greater oversight. The LME licenses warehouses and monitors stocks held in exchange inventories.\n\nLondon copper prices fell to the lowest in a month on Friday, as concerns over the probe continued to take a toll. \"You're seeing material being sold for two reasons - because those financing deals are being unwound, and people who picked up material purely on a speculative basis will take profit now,\" one Singapore trader said.\n\nQingdao Port said on Friday that it had been asked by China's Public Security Authority to help with an investigation relating to aluminium and copper products under the name of a third-party cargo shipment agency, on behalf of a cargo owner.\n\nIt did not name the cargo owner or the shipment agency, and said that Qingdao had not been party to the agreement between the two. The metal had merely been stored at its Danang branch.\n\nIt did not say how much metal was involved, but said that it was an \"immaterial proportion\" of its total annual throughput. It also said that none of the company's employees were under investigation.\n\nQingdao Port International is the primary operator, handling about 76 per cent of the port's total cargo last year. \"Everything in Qingdao port is running normally,\" the operator's chairman, Zheng Minghui, told reporters at the company's listing ceremony at the Hong Kong stock exchange, but declined further comment.\n\nIts shares ended down at HK$3.71 on Friday compared to their IPO price of HK$3.76. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

By 2019, Tony Fung predicts it will be a gambling destination to rival Macau.\n\nThe Hong Kong property developer last week won early-stage government backing for plans to build an A$8.15 billion (S$9.5 billion) casino resort on a former sugarcane farm north of the town.\n\nWith targeted first-stage completion in late 2018 and 7,500 hotel rooms around an artificial lagoon, 18-hole golf course and water park, it'll nearly triple the region's hotel accommodations and be bigger than Singapore's two integrated resorts put together.\n\n\"We are extremely confident that Cairns can be a global destination,\" said Justin Fung, Mr Tony Fung's son and chief executive officer of development company Aquis Resort at the Great Barrier Reef in an interview last week.\n\n\"This is the closest western city to China,\" he said of the tropical Australian city.\n\nMr Tony Fung's quest faces competition across the region as investors locked out of Macau, which has licensed just six casino operators to tap its US$45 billion gambling market, plan new resorts from Sri Lanka to South Korea, the Philippines and Japan.\n\nWith Chinese spending on overseas trips rising 26 per cent during 2013 to US$129 billion, the country is already the world's largest source of outbound tourist revenue.\n\nCompetition from Asian gaming resorts and gambling websites is a challenge to Australia's casino industry, according to a November report by researcher Ibisworld.\n\nRevenue growth will slow to 2.9 per cent a year over the five years to June 2019, from 3.6 per cent over the previous five, Ibisworld estimates.\n\nWith A$4.8 billion of expenditure by Chinese tourists in 2013, Australia is currently capturing less than 4 per cent of China's tourism exports. Casinos' revenue of A$3.5 billion accounts for just 18 per cent of a gambling sector dominated by slot machines in pubs, sports betting and lotteries, according to a 2010 government report.\n\nCairns's existing Reef Casino Trust, the city's only casino operator, posted A$24 million in revenue last year, and competes with Crown Resorts and Skycity Entertainment Group gambling halls in Perth and Darwin that are also less than eight hours' flight from Hong Kong.\n\nThat's not deterring the government of the city's Queensland state, which plans to issue three new casino licences to lure Asian gamblers and stimulate job growth amid a fall in coal prices that will help drive a A$324 million decline in government mining royalties by June 2017.\n\nProposed developments in Cairns, Brisbane and the Gold Coast could bring the same benefits that Genting Singapore's Resorts World Sentosa and Las Vegas Sands' Marina Bay Sands brought to Singapore, Queensland Premier Campbell Newman said last October.\n\nThe hotels helped fuel a 20 per cent jump in tourist numbers to the city-state after they opened in 2010, he said.\n\nShares in Echo Entertainment Group, which operates existing casinos in Brisbane and the Gold Coast and has said those cities' gambling markets can't support much more development, fell as much as 2.6 per cent before closing down 0.4 per cent at A$2.74 in Sydney. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index declined 0.2 per cent.\n\n\"Everyone's seen the success of Singapore, which is just being used as a blueprint elsewhere,\" Killian Murphy, an analyst at CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, said. \"Potentially Australia as a whole becomes a better sell into the Chinese market\" if it has more resorts for tourists to choose from.\n\nCairns is well placed to exploit that market, said Mr Fung. Another Fung family company has already bought about 77 per cent of the Reef Casino Trust as part of a A$214 million takeover.\n\n\"We're sitting on the doorstep of the Great Barrier Reef,\" he said. \"As the Chinese middle-class and wealthy travel, one of the first things they're going to embrace is the natural environment. Cairns has that in spades.\"\n\nFloods, cyclones, a strong Australian dollar and the rise of competing markets in Asia have stymied growth at some resorts along the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nProperties on Dunk and Bedarra islands, for example, sold in late 2011 for about 15 per cent and 20 per cent of their 2007 values respectively.\n\nChinese-Australian billionaire William Han paid A$12 million for Lindeman Island in 2012, a 10th of what Club Mediterranee SA had spent to buy and expand it in the early 1990s.\n\nSandwiched between the volcanic Atherton Tablelands and the lagoon of the barrier reef and fringed by mangrove swamps populated by man-eating crocodiles, Cairns has attracted Chinese visitors since gold prospectors flocked to the region in the 1870s.\n\nIt's grown into a tourist spot and jumping-off point for visits to the Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest coral system, \"a perfect place to meet other travellers\" whose downtown is \"more board shorts than briefcases\", according to the Lonely Planet tourist guide. It's home to more than 10 scuba-diving schools and 40 backpacker hostels.\n\nNot everyone welcomes the proposed development.\n\n\"It's horrific,\" said Gayle Hannah, who came to the region as an 18-year-old in 1971. \"Most likely it's going to sit there and moulder and just be a headache.\"\n\nBuilding such a big resort in the region is \"crazy\", she said. \"The Asian market is looking for the things we already have - the reef, rainforest, quiet, birds, good food,\" she said.\n\nAn online petition opposing the development has attracted 1,753 signatures at the website communityrun.org.\n\nThe 343-hectare site for the Aquis resort will include two theatres, a convention centre, a sports stadium, a water park, and an aquarium, as well as shops, restaurants, and 1,800 homes for staff, according to a July 2013 proposal to the government.\n\nStage 1 of the Aquis resort would have 4,000 rooms, and there's no date set for the expansion to 7,500, Ben Ready, a spokesman for the Aquis project, said yesterday.\n\nOnce complete, the complex of eight hotels will be as large as Moscow's Izmailovo Hotel Complex, the world's biggest, and surpass the 5,044-room MGM Grand in Las Vegas.\n\n\"I see more luxury projects creating a gaming destination for the Asian market,\" Mr Fung said. \"If you can create enough quality product, then certainly the demand is there.\"\n\nThe Fung family has spoken to financial institutions about funding the resort and haven't yet committed to any, he said. He didn't name any partners for the project.\n\nQueensland may struggle to digest such a sharp increase in gambling tourism, said CIMB's Mr Murphy.\n\n\"I just think three new integrated resorts is stretching it,\" he said. \"Trying to convince a gambler to come here can be difficult. You're talking a nine or ten-hour flight\" from cities in China.\n\nThe entire Tropical North Queensland region including the city contained only 3,892 hotel rooms in June 2013, according to government data. Those hotels had occupancy rates of 68 per cent in the year and average room rates of A$143 a night, about 25 per cent below the national average, separate data show.\n\nThat's not deterring Hong Kong-based Mr Fung. The right facilities can attract visitors in numbers such as those who've been lured by other casino resorts in the region, he said.\n\n\"We're on the doorstep of Macau and we've seen the incredible growth of that market. We're close to Singapore and we've seen what just two properties there are capable of doing,\" he said. \"There is that aspect of 'If you build it, they will come'.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCapitaLand\u2019s LyndenWoods sells 94% of units on launch day at average S$2,450 psf\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM\n\nUK homebuyer demand rebounds to a six-month high, index shows\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:30 AM", "images": []}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/deciding-based-market-cap", "site_title": "Deciding based on market cap", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nDeciding based on market cap\n\nIt is just as important to consider, when analysing stock investments, the relative size of a listed company or trust, says GEOFF HOWIE\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jun 8, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWHETHER we are looking to buy a house, a car or a new set of clothes, a product's relative measurements such as weight, length and capacity can be just as important to our purchasing decisions as the price tag or brand name.\n\nA brand new Harley-Davidson, for example, is not of much practical use to a family of five as a means of transport, even if it is going for a good price. Getting the right size is important not only for our own purposes but also when we think about resale potential.\n\nIt might not be too different with stock investment decisions.\n\nStock listings come in all shapes, sizes and flavours. While investment analysis often centres on the industry sectors and geographic markets, it is just as important to consider the relative size of a listed company or trust.\n\nIn many ways, a stock's market capitalisation, or \"market cap\", is just as critical to an investor as the name of the stock issuer. Market cap is measured by the number of shares issued by a company multiplied by their subsequent share price. It is one of the key ways of measuring a company's size and market value relative to its peers.\n\nIn May 2010, Apple became the world's largest technology company when its market cap on the Nasdaq exchange exceeded that of Microsoft, a moment seen by many as a symbolic turning point in the history of the world's big technology brands.\n\nStocks are generally categorised into large caps, mid caps and small caps. Individual investors often ask their brokers and remisiers about the average sizes of large, mid or small-cap stocks in Singapore - in addition to any difference in the nature or risk of these different categorisations. This is because investors categorise and group stocks according to certain criteria.\n\nSimple methods include the relevant business sector and where in the world assets are based or revenue is generated. These can change over time as a company either expands or contracts, or makes strategic acquisitions or disposals.\n\nThis is particularly the case in Singapore with a highly diversified stock market by business line and revenue reach. Perhaps, one of the most important criteria that can change over time is the market cap of the listed company. In tune with the share price, the market cap can move through the traditional classifications of large caps, mid caps and small caps. Hence, small-cap stocks can become mid-cap stocks or large-cap stocks and vice-versa.\n\nIn the case of Singapore stocks, FTSE Group publishes indices that group stocks according to their relative sizes. Using this method of categorisation, the majority of stocks listed on the SGX Mainboard fit into one of four indices: the FTSE Straits Times Index (STI), FTSE ST Mid Cap Index, FTSE ST Small Cap Index and the FTSE ST Fledgling Index. Together, these indices represent 499 of the stocks listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX).\n\nThe stocks included in the STI, Mid Cap Index and Small Cap Index together make up the FTSE ST All Share Index. This index is a broader performance benchmark of the Singapore stock market than the Straits Times Index (STI).\n\nAt the end of May, the average market capitalisation of an STI constituent was about $18 billion. For a constituent of the Mid Cap Index, it was $2.4 billion, and for the Small Cap Index, it was $488 million. The average market capitalisation of a Fledgling Index constituent was $72 million.\n\nA capitalisation of $1 billion marked the general threshold between a Mid Cap and Small Cap index constituent at the end of May. That is, most of the lowest capitalised stocks of the Mid Cap Index maintained a market capitalisation above $1 billion, while most of the largest capitalised stocks of the Small Cap Index maintained a market capitalisation near or just below $1 billion.\n\nFor the mid cap to large cap threshold, the largest weightings of the Mid Cap Index maintained full market capitalisation levels around $5 billion, as did the smallest weightings of the STI.\n\nAscendas Reit moved to the STI from the FTSE ST Mid Cap Index last week. Ascendas Reit was the largest weighting of the FTSE ST Mid Cap index and maintained a full market capitalisation of $5.9 billion as at May 30.\n\nThe 185 stocks of the All Share Index are made up of 30 STI stocks, 50 stocks of the Mid Cap Index and 105 stocks of the Small Cap Index. By comparison, the Fledgling Index is made up of 314 stocks.\n\nSmall cap, high volatility\n\nSmall-cap stocks have generally been more volatile than their larger counterparts in recent years. This is confirmed through a comparison of annualised volatility levels of the STI, Mid Cap Index and Small Cap Index. Over the five years ended May 30, the Small Cap Index generated annualised volatility of 20.4 per cent, versus 16.4 per cent for the Mid Cap Index and 14.3 per cent for the STI. Hence, the average price swings of the small caps as represented by the Small Cap Index were more significant than the large caps as represented by the STI over the past five years.\n\nMeanwhile, the largest weightings of the FTSE ST Mid Cap Index include Suntec Reit, UOL Group, CapitaCommercial Trust, Keppel Land, Singapore Post, Ezion Holdings, Yangzijiang Shipbuilding, Sats, Keppel Reit and Venture Corp. The average market capitalisation of the 10 largest constituents at the end of May stood at about $4 billion. As noted earlier, the average market cap for all constituents of the FTSE ST Mid Cap Index is $2.4 billion.\n\nWith CapitaMalls Asia being deleted from the STI last week, Ascendas Reit left the FTSE ST Mid Cap Index and joined the STI. As noted in this column a month ago, the STI reserve list comes into play if a constituent is deleted from the index during the intra-review period.\n\nMeanwhile, Ezra Holdings moved from the FTSE ST Small Cap Index into the FTSE ST Mid Cap Index. Following Ascendas Reit joining the STI, there are now 17 of the 50 Mid Cap Index constituents represented in the Real Estate Investment Trust (Reit) sector, according to the Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB).\n\nReit impact\n\nHence, Reits and stapled property trusts still have had the largest sectorial impact on the recent performance of the Mid Cap Index. These 17 related constituents make up as much as 40 per cent of the free float capitalisation of the Mid Cap Index. The Reits and property trusts, which average an indicative dividend yield of 6 per cent, have had an impact on the dividend distributions associated with the Mid Cap Index.\n\nThis is supported by 47 of the 50 Mid Cap constituents maintaining an indicative dividend yield. As at end-May, the Mid Cap Index returned 7.2 per cent in price and 9.9 per cent in total return.\n\nThe impact of the Reits and property trusts on the FTSE ST Mid Cap Index has gradually increased over time. In October 2011, the then 14 Reits and stapled property trust constituents made up 36 per cent of the free float capitalisation of the Mid Cap Index.\n\nThe five best-performing constituents in the year-to-date through to end-May were GuocoLeisure, Oxley Holdings, United Engineers, Vard Holdings and Bumitama Agri. These five stocks each represented a different ICB sector. The five worst-performing constituents of the Mid Cap Index over the timeframe were Super Group, Ezra Holdings, Yangzijiang Shipping, Neptune Orient Lines and Rowsley.\n\nSmall Cap Index\n\nThe 105 constituents of the Small Cap Index also have significant affiliation with the Reit Sector, albeit to a lesser extent. Of the 10 largest constituents of the Small Cap Index at the end of May, there were seven Reits or stapled trusts - Cambridge Industrial Trust, AIMS AMP Capital Industrial Reit, Cache Logistics Trust, Sabana Shari'ah Compliant Reit, Frasers Commercial Trust, Ascendas Hospitality Trust and First Reit. Together, these seven trusts accounted for one fifth of the Index weightings.\n\nOutside of the Reit Sector contingent, there are 27 more ICB Sectors represented in the Small Cap Index. The remaining three corporations that helped make up the 10 largest weightings at the end of May were United Envirotech, Ezra Holdings and Yoma Strategic Holdings.\n\nHowever, as mentioned earlier, Ezra Holdings left the FTSE ST Small Cap Index to join the FTSE ST Mid Cap Index last week. The average market capitalisation of those 10 largest constituents at the end of May was about $930 million. The average market cap for all constituents of the FTSE ST Small Cap Index was $488 million.\n\nAs in the case of the Mid Cap Index, the five best-performing constituents in the Small Cap Index this year at the end of May each represented different sectors. These stocks were AusGroup, UMS Holdings, Stats ChipPAC, BreadTalk Group and Q&M Dental Group. The five worst-performing constituents of the Small Cap Index over the timeframe were Blumont Group, Asiasons Capital, Liongold Corporation, KrisEnergy and Hu An Cable Holdings. As at end-May, the FTSE ST Small Cap Index had returned 3 per cent in price and 5.5 per cent in total return.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2014, both the Mid Cap Index and Small Cap Index generated more similar performances. In the second quarter through to the end of May, the Mid Cap Index outperformed the Small Cap Index by 4.4 per cent on a total return basis.\n\nThe writer is SGX's market strategist\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

That's about half of the overall size of the entire European football market, whose takings went up 2 per cent to 19.9 billion euros.\n\nThe top five leagues are the Premier League in England, the Bundesliga in Germany, the La Liga in Spain, the Serie A in Italy and Ligue 1 in France.\n\nNot surprising to football fans is the report's finding that the Premier League continues to rake in the highest takings - it earned 2.9 billion euros in total revenue for the period, almost 50 per cent more than the Bundesliga, the second-highest earner. The Premier League's earnings were also 7 per cent up from the year-ago period.\n\nMuch of the revenue growth in these top five leagues was driven by a limited number of eminent clubs; in the Premier League's case, these were Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool, which accounted for over 60 per cent of this growth.\n\nIn Germany, Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund were responsible for over 80 per cent of the Bundesliga's earnings increase.\n\nIn the case of Serie A, Juventus accounted for over three-quarters of the league's revenue growth, thanks to its return to the Champions League. The Champions League is the region's most prestigious tournament, featuring the top teams from each of Europe's strongest national leagues.\n\nFor Ligue 1, Paris Saint-German accounted for all of the league's earnings growth for the second year running.\n\nAll five leagues, with the exception of the Bundesliga, derived their earnings mainly from broadcast revenue and commercial sources.\n\nThe Bundesliga was also the league which had the best handle on its costs. Its wages-to-revenue ratio was 51 per cent, compared to the Premier League and Serie A's 71 per cent, Ligue 1's 66 per cent and La Liga's 56 per cent.\n\nThe 2012/2013 period also marked the first one in which the Premier League's wages-to-revenue ratio crossed the 70 per cent threshold for the first time. Six of the league's clubs had total wages above the average \u00a389 million ($187.7 million). And Manchester City chalked up a wage bill of \u00a3233 million - the highest recorded for a football club, or any professional sport for that matter.\n\nStill, Deloitte said, the overall \u00a3125 million rise in Premier League wages for the period was not as significant an increase as anticipated, demonstrating that restraint is being shown at some clubs. \"We expect 2013/14 to see another rise in wages as the first payments of the new broadcast deal flow through, but this may be tempered to an extent by the new financial regulations,\" it said.\n\nDeloitte expects the value of global premium sports broadcast rights to rise by 14 per cent to \u00a316 billion in 2014. And it sees the big five leagues' combined revenue to breach 11.5 billion euros in 2014/15.\n\nFor the Premier League, it expects commercial revenues to exceed \u00a31 billion in 2015/16, for overall revenues to go over \u00a33.3 billion, and for player spending to total \u00a32.5 billion in 2016/17.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Having closed less than 100 points away, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is almost sure to test the 17,000 level. If they are to run much further, however, the bulls must fight two headwinds: valuation and rising interest rates.\n\nAs anticipated, the ECB cut deposit rates for banks below zero, effectively making it cheaper for lenders to give loans than to sit on reserves. This sparked the late-week rally, and the jobs report supported it. A higher-than-forecast 217,000 jobs were added to payrolls in May and the unemployment rate held steady at 6.3 per cent. While the four-month aggregate of jobs added was the highest since the 1990s, what observers such as Dallas Federal Reserve president Richard Fisher have called \"structural\" problems persist. A low participation rate still shows that millions have been left behind in the recovery.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The company, owned by tycoon Hadi Tanaga, has been without a CEO since Marc Singleton left more than two months ago.\n\nMr Khoo is best known for devising Citibank's clever balloon loan scheme in the late 1990s. To help buyers financially, only a smaller downpayment was required upfront, together with lower monthly instalments which progressively increased and culminated with a final lump sum payment at the end of the loan period. The idea behind it was that the instalments would increase with buyers' income levels.\n\nAccording to one dealer, \"the balloon later burst because incomes didn't rise as fast as expected and the economy went south\".\n\nBut rather than run Premium Automobiles on a day-to-day basis, Mr Khoo is expected to leverage his banking expertise and experience from the backend, where he is likely to identify areas for improvement, such as seeking better financing terms for both the company and its customers.\n\n\"He is an expert in trade financing and if anyone can cut financing costs and squeeze more out of the business, it will be him,\" said the managing director of a luxury dealership. \"And with his wealth of banking contacts, he could even raise the image of the Audi brand further.\"\n\nThe director of another luxury dealership called Mr Khoo a \"business strategist with a lot of bright ideas\".\n\n\"I think he will come with a new insight into the business because even as a banker, he was intimately linked to the auto business,\" said the director. \"He worked with SMEs previously and he knows the ground very well. He is versatile; he can be talking to a towkay in a coffeeshop one minute, and the next, he can put on a tie and talk to a CEO.\"\n\nAt DBS, which he joined in 2003, Mr Khoo was in charge of the enterprise banking unit which handled the financial and banking needs of small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\nIn the first quarter of this year, Audi was ranked Singapore's sixth most popular brand with a 5.7 per cent market share, down from fifth place and an 8 per cent market share as at end-2013.\n\nIts main rivals, Mercedes-Benz and BMW, are currently in No 1 and No 3 positions, respectively.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The completion of the acquisition will bring its total share in the plant to 51 per cent.\n\nAluminium prices hit a low of US$1,600 a tonne in the first half of this year, but have since risen to US$1,800 a tonne. Despite the weak prices, the Xinjiang plant, with its low production costs, has enabled XinRen to remain profitable, it said.\n\nNow in its third phase of development, the plant produced about 400,000 tonnes of aluminium last year and contributed 93.6 million yuan to the company's full-year earnings of 61.6 million yuan. Output is expected to double this year and reach its full capacity of 1.6 million tonnes a year by the end of 2016.\n\nAbout 80 per cent of aluminium producers in China are in the red, said Xinhua's China Economic Information Service.\n\nThe Xinjiang plant has managed to keep its costs low because of its access to an abundant source of coal, XinRen said yesterday. Xinjiang has about 40 per cent of China's coal resources and coal prices in the area are about a quarter of the national average. The plant also makes savings from its in-house power generating units.\n\nZeng Chaolin, XinRen's executive chairman, said: \"Our increased investment in the Xinjiang plant is in line with the group's drive to stay profitable, even during this trying industry downturn, and remain as one of China's leading integrated upstream aluminium producers.\"\n\nAs the Chinese government aims to cut aluminium over-capacity and high-cost producers are forced out of the market, China's existing aluminium capacity of 30 million tonnes could be trimmed by 30 per cent in the next three years - at a time demand for aluminium is on the rise.\n\nIncreasingly, aluminium is being used to make lighter, more fuel-efficient vehicles, as well as healthcare products and packaging, paving the way for a rise in aluminium prices, said Mr Zeng.\n\nXinRen's executive director Liang Hongbo said the currently low aluminium prices enabled the company to acquire the additional share and ready itself for the market's recovery.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 6, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIF there is one thing that French interior designer Isabelle Miaja dislikes, it is to be associated with a certain look. The founder of Miaja Design Group has been designing interiors for prestigious hotel groups, resorts, boutiques, corporate and high-end residential clients for nearly 20 years. The Singapore-based firm is known for its \"unique and distinctive\" approach to each project. \"There is no one style, since it all depends on the site, and every place has its own soul,\" says Ms Miaja.\n\nThe most recent hotel she designed in Singapore is the Sofitel So, where the interiors are a blend of French chic and Singaporean design with touches of old and new. The same rule applies for her home in Upper Bukit Timah, where she lives with her three children. The two-storey terrace home has an eclectic feel because of the many artworks as well as decorative pieces that Ms Miaja has amassed over her many trips to South-east Asia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States.\n\nThe single mum, who received her training in Los Angeles says that \"as I'm an interior designer, the home is always evolving\". They have been living at this address for 12 years, and there has never once been a total revamp. \"Instead I'm always finding something to add,\" she says. Their previous home in Singapore was an apartment closer to town.\n\nHer children, aged 15 to 25, are used to their mum constantly filling up the home. \"But at the same time, they warn me not to turn the home into a museum,\" she says with a laugh. \"I must stop buying, because the kids say that if I buy one more item, I would be considered a hoarder.\" But still, she sometimes sneaks in a piece or two.\n\nShe is quick to decide whether to buy an item or not, but at the same time, is critical about what she purchases. \"My work allows me to look at many beautiful items, but it takes a lot for me to fall in love with something,\" she says. \"The piece has to make me feel that I've never seen it before.\" She speaks excitedly about a painting of a tulip, in a frame made of mosaic tiles. \"The tulip is my favourite flower, and I love how the artist has used mosaic tiles to create a painting of sorts on the frame,\" she explains.\n\nWhile she designs bespoke furniture pieces for her hotel projects, Ms Miaja is very much into having art in her home, including some of her own design.\n\nStanding in the corner of her living room is a rototem - a rotating totem, similar to the three that she designed for the Sofitel Mumbai. The rototem comes with images of nature and animals. \"It tells the story of my life, the things I love,\" she explains. \"I like art pieces that I can touch, hence the pieces of the totem rotate.\" She adds that sculptures are her favourite art form, because, \"I can create some breathing space around the art piece, unlike paintings, which are usually up against a wall.\"\n\nMs Miaja is a firm believer that the personality of the art collector can be seen through the selection of art. \"I'm someone who appreciates colours and strokes, so hopefully people can tell I'm an extrovert with a love for the eclectic,\" she says. Her love for animals is obvious, not only because she shares her home with a cat, two dogs and three rabbits, but also in her choice of decorative items.\n\nStanding in the garden are a pair of life-sized metal giraffes, which were shipped back from South Africa. Horse figurines feature widely in the home, \"because these animals are my passion\", while several chicken and rooster figurines take their place in the kitchen. \"I didn't grow up with animals because the apartment had little space, so perhaps now I want to always surround myself with them,\" she says.\n\nHer work takes her overseas many days of the month, but when she is home, the kitchen is her favourite spot.\n\n\"When we have guests over, everyone loves to be in the kitchen, and they spill out onto the patio too,\" she says. And her speciality dish? \"I can make the best paella in Singapore,\" she says with a firm nod.\n\nWhile colours feature largely in most parts of the home, softer shades of beige and off-white reign in her bedroom. The look here is more feminine and elegant, very much like how Ms Miaja is. \"It is always nice to come back to my own bedroom,\" she says.\n\nWithout missing a beat, she says \"hire me\" when asked how homeowners can constantly keep their abode looking fresh.\n\nShe goes on to say that regardless of the look, a place must always \"feel good. It is difficult to explain but there must be a balance of energy\". From her many projects around the world to her own home, it is clear that she has this skill down pat.\n\nBut for the decoratively challenged homeowner, her advice is \"to be daring and constantly move things around the home till it feels right\". She still does this, such as replacing a duller art piece at the entrance with a mirrored one, which instantly brightens up the home.\n\n\"And add fresh flowers - they always do the trick,\" she says.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\n@TaySuanChiangBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Recent data suggest, however, that \"growth has stabilised and growth momentum is expected to accelerate in the second quarter of 2014\".\n\nThe World Bank report came a day after the International Monetary Fund published the results of a regular economic consultation with Chinese authorities in which the IMF forecast that China's growth should be around 7.5 per cent this year, but could slip to 7 per cent in 2015.\n\nThe IMF said bluntly that \"activity in China since the global financial crisis has been too dependent on credit and investment, including in real estate. While this has supported growth and provided a boost to global demand, it is not sustainable and (creates) rising vulnerabilities.\"\n\nBoth institutions expressed overall confidence in the China's ability to achieve a controlled slowdown or soft landing while also pointing to a series of risks.\n\n\"Recent growth rates (in China) have been significantly below levels observed over the past decade as drivers of economic growth shift from manufacturing to services on the supply side, and from investment to consumption on the demand side,\" the World Bank said in its update.\n\nThe growth slowdown in the first quarter of this year \"reflected a combination of dissipating effects of earlier growth-support measures, subdued external environment, and tighter credit, especially for real estate activities\".\n\nIn recent months, however, economic activity, including industrial production has started to show signs of acceleration, the World Bank said. This is \"expected to continue into the next two quarters of this year - partly reflecting the effect of new growth-supporting measures, robust consumption, and a recovery of external demand\".\n\nA planned decline in Chinese investment growth will be largely offset by a gradual increase in consumption growth, supported by an increase in household incomes, the World Bank said.\n\n\"The fundamental drivers of the global recovery remain intact and should provide a favourable tailwind to China's net export growth. However, headwinds from a gradual deceleration of credit growth can be expected to weigh on domestic economic activity.\"\n\nThe World Bank said that the main channels of a possible disorderly unwinding are related to local government financing, which in case of a disorderly deleveraging could trigger a sharp slowdown in investment growth, and to prospects of sectors such as real estate, which in case of an abrupt change in the cost of capital could result in debt service difficulties.\n\nIt called for fiscal and financial sector reforms to address financial stability risks in the medium term.

That ended a rocky five days with positive sessions bookending a soft mid-week.\n\nAfter bouncing up and down within a 33-point range during the week, the index managed to eke out a 0.1 per cent gain from its May 30 close of 3,295.85.\n\nA total of 1.9 billion shares worth $1.1 billion were traded yesterday, with about four gainers for every three losers.\n\nSentiment yesterday received an overnight boost from the European Central Bank (ECB), which lowered its target refinancing interest rate to 0.15 per cent and its deposit rate to negative 0.1 per cent. The move sparked hopes that European banks will lend out more money to the broader economy instead of paying to park funds with the central bank.\n\n\"Overall, the ECB's dramatic moves would help to support global market sentiment, especially given that (ECB chief) Mario Draghi spoke about potential further moves, including outright asset purchases or quantitative easing,\" OCBC wrote in a note.\n\nThe blue chips were mostly higher, with the three banks seeing some of the most turnover. DBS Group Holdings gained 0.4 per cent, or six cents, to close at $17.08, while OCBC Bank added 0.3 per cent, or three cents, to end at $9.76. United Overseas Bank closed at $22.74, up by 1.7 per cent or 37 cents.\n\nChina Environment drew significant attention as its stock climbed 32.2 per cent, or 9.5 cents, to 39 cents. The sharp climb caught the eye of the Singapore Exchange, which sent a trading query to the provider of industrial waste gas treatment systems.\n\nTraders were puzzled as well. A rumour appeared to be making the rounds about a possible new significant investor, but that could not be confirmed.\n\n\"Everyone's talking about that stock,\" one trader said. \"I didn't get in, not on my side, but I think some of the others did.\"\n\nFeedstock and biofuels company Lereno Bio-Chem jumped 20 per cent, or 0.1 cent, to 0.6 cent and also drew a query from the market regulator, but the stock was less closely watched given its low share price.\n\nInvestment holding company InnoPac Holdings lost 6.7 per cent, or 0.1 cent, to close at 1.4 cents a day after spiking by 0.2 cent. The company said overnight that it would have to revise its results for the year ended Dec 31, 2013, to make an additional $34 million provision on the failure of a counterparty to provide collateral for a derivative receivable transaction.\n\nThat will widen InnoPac's reported 2013 loss of $20.8 million to about $54.8 million.\n\nCatheter maker QT Vascular continued to pick up steam, adding a further 8.3 per cent, or four cents, to close at 52 cents yesterday in the wake of the company obtaining approval to sell a key product in the United States for chronic heart disease treatment.\n\nQT stock was trading at just 40 cents a week earlier.\n\nSTATS ChipPAC rose 7.5 per cent, or 4.5 cents, to close at 64.5 cents, amid ongoing speculation about a possible takeover bid.\n\nThe company said on Thursday that it has been in contact with more than one party to explore a possible acquisition of the semiconductor testing and assembly company.

Chinese carriers, in particular, were hit by weakness in the Chinese yuan.\n\nSingapore Airlines (SIA), which released its Q4 financial results last month, posted a 60 per cent decline in net profit to $27 million. Tax credits and exceptional gains bolstered the bottom line, keeping it out of the red. For the full year ended March 31, net profit slipped 5.1 per cent to $359.5 million, dragged down by exceptional items and a weaker share of results from associated companies.\n\nYesterday, SIA closed at S$10.52, gaining six cents from its previous close and recovering from the low of S$10.19 touched on May 20.\n\nQantas ended the day's trading at A$1.375 (S$1.61), up two Australian cents but down from the high of A$1.405 on May 30. Last month, the struggling Australian carrier said it aimed to lay off up to 100 pilots. This came after it had said in February that it would slash 5,000 jobs.\n\nCathay Pacific closed at HK$14.34 (S$2.32), down four Hong Kong cents. Last month, Cathay traded at a high of HK$15.26 and a low of HK$14.12.\n\nIata noted that yields were weak both in the US and elsewhere in Q1 2014, while global fares (in US$) also continue to be dragged down by weakness in Asia and by currency distortions.\n\nJet fuel prices are still hovering above US$120 per barrel, which is high by historical standards.\n\nFrom January to April, Asia-Pacific carriers have recorded a 6.9 per cent year-on-year expansion in passenger traffic (measured in revenue-passenger-kilometres), outpaced by a 7.9 per cent boost in capacity (in available-seat-kilometres), pushing load factor downwards to 77 per cent.\n\nOn the cargo front, freight traffic (in freight-tonne-kilometres) was up 4.2 per cent - an improvement from last year's lacklustre performance - though capacity expanded at 7.3 per cent.\n\nAs a result, freight load factor worked out to 53.7 per cent for the region.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 215,000 increase. Unemployment in May was unchanged at 6.3 per cent.\n\nImproving business confidence as sales grow and the economy rebounds from its worst performance in three years will probably mean headcounts will continue to climb. Rising employment gives Federal Reserve policy makers reason to keep paring back record monetary stimulus.\n\n\"We're seeing the continuation of solid payrolls gains, which is an accomplishment for the economy and will boost consumer and business fundamentals,\" said Laura Rosner, US economist at BNP Paribas in New York, which forecast a 215,000 gain in payrolls. \"We're slowly moving in the direction of stronger earnings growth, which is really what we need to see for the recovery to continue.\"\n\nMay marked the fourth straight month payrolls have increased to at least 200,000, the first time that's happened since September 1999 to January 2000.\n\nEmployment in health services climbed by the most in nine months, while payrolls at factories, business services and retailers increased as well. Hourly earnings also picked up from a year ago. Employment at private service providers rose 198,000, while payrolls increased 10,000 at factories, boosted by hiring at vehicle-assembly plants. Payrolls in education and health services climbed by 63,000 in May. Hiring also accelerated at leisure and hospitality companies.\n\nThe Labour Department's survey of households, used to calculate the unemployment rate, showed 192,000 people entered the labour force, almost matching the number who found jobs. The so-called participation rate, which indicates the share of working-age people in the labour force, held at 62.8 per cent, matching the lowest since March 1978.\n\nThe increase in payrolls put total employment beyond its peak of 138.4 million reached in January 2008, one month after the start of the deepest recession since World War II. The number of employees on payrolls stood at almost 138.5 million last month, Labour Department data showed.\n\nThe underemployment rate - which includes part-time workers who'd prefer a full-time position and people who want to work but have given up looking - fell to 12.2 per cent, the lowest since October 2008, from 12.3 per cent.\n\nEconomists surveyed by Bloomberg from May 2 to 7 see the US economy adding 225,000 jobs on average each month this year. That would be up from 2013's average of 194,250 as well as 186,330 the previous year.\n\nWhile the economy is creating more jobs, wage growth has lagged behind. Slower pay gains corroborate Fed chair Janet Yellen's view that a \"substantial amount of slack\" remains in the labour market. Limited income growth stands in the way of faster consumer spending.\n\nFed officials are watching the labour market as they get closer to completing their bond-purchase programme later this year and start considering the timing of the first interest-rate increase since 2006. The Fed's Open Market Committee has pared its monthly asset-buying to US$45 billion and said further reductions in measured steps are likely.

Debbie Yong finds out\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 6, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nFROM shopping malls to HDB flats and mobile phones, nothing, it seems, is spared in upgrading-obsessed Singapore - not even humble hawker fare. Once the stuff of sweaty kopitiams, local cuisine is increasingly finding its way into upscale, air-conditioned settings.\n\nBut we are not just talking about the obligatory inclusion of a made-for-tourists $20 char kway tiao on the menus of soulless hotel lobby-cafes. Newly opened dining spots such as Clifford Pier, Ujong, Char and Labyrinth are taking familiar native dishes and giving them a reboot, either by using better cooking techniques, working in premium or preservative-free ingredients, or vamping things up with a circa-2014 mod presentation. Notably, they're also fronting their upgraded local cuisine as their key selling point.\n\nWhy the recent shift in spotlight away from trendy Spanish and French cuisine back onto home soil? Chef Han Liguang of Labyrinth, which serves up scientific cooking-driven signature dishes such as chilli crab ice-cream and chendol xiao long bao, thinks the local movement is part of a global wave.\n\nWith chefs such as Yim Jungsik and Alvin Leung winning international accolades for their upscale takes on Korean and Hong Kong street eats respectively, Mr Han says, \"it gives younger chefs like me assurance that Asian street food can be done with a level of finesse, and there are people who will appreciate it.\"\n\nFurthermore, the banker-turned-self-taught chef adds, serving Singaporean cuisine naturally means that he has better access to fresher produce, as recipes typically call for easily available native ingredients, rather than pricey imported products. Anthony Ung of Char, which serves Cantonese noodle shop roasts in a contemporary art-clad venue that passes for a trendy Western cafe, points out that with rents for hawker stalls on the rise, it is better value even for penny-pinching food and beverage entrepreneurs to turn to full-fledged restaurant venues instead. \"For a little more money, you can get a much bigger space,\" says Mr Ung, who likewise wanted to open a hawker stall initially.\n\nThe rent for cooked food hawker stalls, which have an average size of 200 sq ft, ranges from $300 to $5,000 per month in popular food centres. In comparison, a 1,600 sq ft shophouse unit along Char's up-and-coming Guillemard Road neighbourhood has an asking price of $5,500 in monthly rent.\n\nBut will the promise of a plush restaurant working environment necessarily spur more chefs to learn and preserve heritage recipes?\n\n\"Maybe in my son's generation,\" says Tan Ken Loon of the Naked Finn, which serves up salted egg yolk Scottish crabs and prawn mee made with Spanish carabinero prawns and iberico pork. \"It won't be an easy battle because hawker fare is already regarded as high quality, people don't see the need to improve it.\"\n\nWhile it is true that hawkers are largely revered for their cooking prowess - popular veterans have in recent years been asking for millions of dollars in exchange for their time-honed recipes - their social standing remains disproportionately downtrodden. Think about it: when was the last time you heard anyone boast that their parents are hawkers, or that it is their lifelong ambition to be one?\n\nAccording to recent Temasek Polytechnic culinary school graduate Law Jia Jun, most of his classmates would rather find work in Western cuisine restaurants abroad post-graduation. Says the 20-year-old: \"It's not about the working environment, but how people will perceive you. Being a hawker, cooking hawker food - it is still considered low-class to many.\"\n\nThat's where restaurant operators such as Giovanni Viterale, general manager of The Fullerton Bay Hotel where Clifford Pier is housed says marketing makes a difference: \"There is a need to communicate the quality offerings of the restaurant that present an experience which is distinct from what diners usually would associate with hawker food.\"\n\n\"This includes premium ingredients or ingredients handmade in-house by our chefs, as well as our bespoke furniture, heritage chic dining environment and exquisite waterfront views.\" C\n\nushy surrounds\n\nAnd the demand for such restaurants is definitely there, he says. Besides Clifford Pier, the Fullerton Hotel group's Town Restaurant has partnered with The Straits Times and The Business Times to create the Hawker Masters buffet for the last two years. The week-long buffet that gathers popular local hawkers under one hotel restaurant roof is always fully booked.\n\nBut along with uptown, cushy surrounds also comes other challenges, such as getting diners to shell out more than double for what would usually cost them $4 a plate in a hawker centre, or inviting the inevitable comparison to the street food version. \"Singaporeans are more willing to splash out the cash these days to try out a new restaurant, but they are also very protective of their heritage. If your take on a local dish isn't anything better or different and it doesn't justify the higher price, then they will not return,\" says Mr Han.\n\n\"We have to be willing to pay to preserve our tradition. We are now happily paying $15 for a bowl of ramen and $50 instead of $30 10 years ago for a buffet, but we still expect char kway tiao to cost $2,\" says Leslie Tay of hawker-centric food blog ieatishootipost. \"Once we are willing to pay more for local food, then young hawkers will realise it is financially viable to want to sell char kway tiao instead of ramen or pasta\".\n\nSometimes, even when the heart is willing, the resources aren't there, according to Shen Tan of month-old modern Singaporean restaurant Ujong. Recalling how she had to learn to cook nasi lemak from reading and experimenting on her own when she was starting out, she observes that most hawkers aren't willing to impart their skills and most culinary schools don't include hawker food in their curriculum.\n\nFortunately, greater headway is being made. Recent television shows such as W\n\nok Stars,\n\nin which celebrity chefs Alvin Leung and Willin Low whip into shape a handful of hawker-wannabes, help to glamourise the hawker profession, for one.\n\nLaunched last October, the Hawker Master Trainee Pilot Programme - a collaboration between the Singapore Workforce Development Agency, NEA, property firm Knight Frank and The Business Times - further encourages new blood by pairing off veteran hawkers with aspiring ones.\n\nFrom over 400 applicants, of which 30 trainees were enrolled, two are now running incubation hawker stalls at Amoy Street. In the last quarter of this year, Makansutra founder KF Seetoh will also roll out the first phase of its new Street Food Pro 360 Course, a 30-hour programme conducted by Singapore's best chefs on kitchen skills training, food business operations, and an understanding of the culture of Singapore's food heritage. I\n\nnspiring a new generation\n\nAnother means of transplanting authentic hawker fare into posh environs could be to get financially solvent large restaurant or hotel groups to invest in young and veteran hawkers. \"You start with a small hawker stall and then people will start taking note,\" says ieatishootipost's Mr Tay, \"but you have to be careful about picking partners who are just as passionate.\"\n\nClifford Pier's youthful executive chef Ken Zheng is a Shatec-trained descendant of hawkers, for instance. And fourth-generation hawker Edwin Poh fries up his family recipe Hokkien mee in bespoke cocktail bar Ah Sam Cold Drink Stall, while former executive chef of Chatterbox at the Mandarin Orchard Han Seng Fong, used to run his own chicken rice stall at the Centrepoint before joining Pappasan restaurant at Dorsett Hotel last year. The restaurant now serves a Richman line of food, which features lobsters and fresh scallops in humble dishes such as char kway tiao and fried rice.\n\nBut KF Seetoh thinks there's more to inspiring the new generation of hawkers than the promise of a glamourous workplace and cushy career. Citing the recent spurt of hybrid dining concepts such as gastrobars that serve Singapore-inspired tapas and forward-thinking kopitiams that pair hawker cuisine with $20 craft beers, he says: \"It is not just about getting young or old hawkers to cook in air-con places, it's also about opening up the doors of business and entrepreneurship to this breed of foodies.\n\n\"It takes a total rebranding of our comfort food culture, a total rethink.\"\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\n@DebbieYongBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With some familiar faces on board - both participating teams and sponsors - it promises to be once again a wonderful three months of golf and networking. Presented by Audi Singapore, 20 teams have signed up, with several more expected to join. Some returning teams this year include 2013 and 2012 champions SunMoon Foods in addition to Centurion, Cerebos, Citibank Singapore, DBS Vickers, KPMG, OCBC (Bank of Singapore), Singapore Pools, SPH and Tat Hong.\n\nPatrick Daniel, editor-in-chief of SPH's English and Malay newspapers division, said: \"We're happy to organise this event each year as it's one of the most enjoyable in the group's calendar. It's a great mix of competitiveness, networking and fun. This year, we hope to add even more zip into the mix.\"\n\nSponsors have also come to the fore with Audi Singapore returning as presenting sponsor for the fourth straight year as they have enjoyed partnering The Business Times for the event. The League has also given Audi Singapore the opportunity to grow its network within the local business community, according to Jeff Mannering, managing director, Audi Singapore. \"We get great exposure for our products and the event gives us an additional opportunity to involve our own customers at some of the best golf courses in the world\", he says.\n\n\"Golf is an important part of the Singapore lifestyle. To be involved in such a great event at some of the best golf facilities is definitely a highlight. But to be able to share this experience with some of our customers is even better.\"\n\nAudi Singapore also returns as a hole-in-one sponsor - this year the new Audi S3 sedan will be on offer as the Hole-in-One prize for each of the six games - as do Audemars Piguet and World Golfers Championship. Other sponsors and partners include Boustead Singapore, Centurion, Cerebos, ACE Medical, Ambient Lounge, Ayuthaya Spa, Callaway, Fitness First Singapore and SunMoon Foods, who will be providing SunMoon Fruit Cups and Fruit Crisps in the first and final rounds.\n\nSunMoon Foods, champions in 2013 and 2012, will be trying for the hat trick this year. \"We have always been competitive ever since we first participated in the League, and we encompass the same spirit and determination in both sports and work which makes us a tough team to compete against. We rate our chances well this year,\" offers managing director Ivan Chua. He adds: \"SunMoon has always been passionate about sports, as it aligns with SunMoon's ideals of eating and living healthy. The BT Corporate Golf League has always been a great platform for our company to socialise with the corporate sector. The core of the team is very much the same. Although we may consider injecting excitement in the line-up every year.\"\n\nWhile many familiar names will once again be returning, there are also some fresh faces taking part this year, and they include Walton International, Zyfas Medical and Jenmon and Seah Construction. According to Walton International's Malcolm Loh, the company has a handful of keen golfers among its staff as well as business partners, and this annual event provides an ideal platform for great interaction and bonding, and a way of thanking its business partners for their continual support over the past 18 years. \"We are taking part more for social and recreational purposes. There are no expectations in terms of placing in the League. What is more important is that we go out there and enjoy the game,\" he says.\n\nTan Ju Kuang, editor of Golf Digest Singapore, who are co-organisers of the League, believes that this year's edition promises to be more exciting than ever as it continues to be Singapore's premier corporate team golf event. \"It's heartening to see many of the teams returning year after year to compete in good fun. It's a wonderful way for companies to get together, whether it's with their colleagues or with clients and partners, for six rounds of golf. And when you throw in the fact that the League also provides lunch, dinner, drinks and entertainment, it's an experience that's hard to beat.\"\n\nHe continues: \"As organisers of the BT Corporate Golf League, Golf Digest Singapore is always working to make the experience better for our participants. This year, we've introduced a new format - a Modified System 36 format - which we believe makes it more equitable for golfers of all abilities. We'll also introduce a prize for the team with the best Double Peoria Team Score in each round so that even the golfers with higher handicaps will stand a chance to win something.\"\n\nThis year, the League's venues include rounds at three of Singapore's top clubs - notably Singapore Island Country Club (New Course), Tanah Merah Country Club (Tampines and Garden), and Sentosa Golf Club (Tanjong and Serapong) - and will also include the redeveloped course at Jurong Country Club.\n\nThe first and final legs will be played at Sentosa Golf Club - Tanjong and Serapong respectively. Says Andy Johnston, general manager/director of golf at Sentosa, \"Tanjong course is an aging gem that can be misread from the first overview. The course has seen some hard times enduring the worst drought in Singapore and still shows a few battle scars from a distance. But the course still plays great; it is fair and fun from a set up perspective, landing areas are generous and bunkering is for the most part in front of you.\" He adds: \"However, it is the large ominous greens that make it a fantastic experience. The big large rolling surfaces are fast, smooth and play in a championship style. Bring your best flat stick to score well.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By May Yip\n\nPublished Fri, Jun 6, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE fashion cycle may be dominated by seasonal trends, but when it comes to selling timeless luxury, \"provenance\" is a byword for exclusivity. Which is why every marque from Armani to Zegna touts a back story of its origins much more than any generic brand logo. And for a brand whose tagline reads, \"When your own initials are enough,\" - simply emblazoning images of artisans at work on ad campaigns just isn't going to cut it.\n\nEarlier this year, Bottega Veneta unveiled its new atelier in a restored 18th-century villa, located on a 55,000 sq m historical park in Italy's Vicenza region. What makes Montebello Vicentino - as the state-of-the-art facility for its craftsmen and support staff is called - so impressive isn't just its dedication to craftsmanship (it even houses the Scuola della Pelletteria Bottega Veneta to train future makers of its refined accessories). It is its green cred. The new campus is not only a pioneer in the fashion and luxury sector, but a frontrunner for environmentally sustainable building in Europe.\n\n\"The project itself and the possibilities of what would make a difference, with regard to our employees and the environment, each and every day was an incredible experience,\" enthuses Marco Bizzarri, the president and CEO of Bottega Veneta who was also recently named CEO of the luxury couture and leather goods division for Kering, the brand's parent company. Mr Bizzarri is best known for turning Bottega Veneta into a billion-euro brand in 2013.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

After watching him in 40 films over more than 30 years, audiences know the drill only too well. In no particular order, the Cruise character grins, runs fast, kills hordes of baddies and gets the girl: it's an easy A all the way. But his new movie Edge of Tomorrow is a departure from the norm because he's dead within minutes of the opening scene - and then dies dozens more times after that.\n\nThe film is both a conventional sci-fi action flick and a wink at the notion of the star vehicle, where Cruise gets to indulge in a bit of self-mockery while doing his thing: you know - the grinning, running, killing and wooing. Most satisfying of all, Edge of Tomorrow is cracking entertainment and everything you ever wanted in a big-budget summer blockbuster.\n\nSome things never change, though. Cruise looks impressive in uniform and over the years he's starred in plenty of movies that belaboured the point. In fact, he's played military men in four different decades - Top Gun (1986), A Few Good Men (1992), The Last Samurai (2003), to name a few and now Edge of Tomorrow - which must be a record of some sort.\n\nThe twist this time is that he's not a brash anti-authority type who takes matters in his own hands. The movie is set in the future, during a time of global apocalypse. Europe has been invaded by a superior alien race and is on the verge of catastrophic defeat but the defence forces, aided by the invention of a high-tech battle suit, are beginning to push back.\n\nCruise is Major William Cage, a public relations officer who is all smiles when he's on camera but has an aversion to combat. It's not often you see a character he plays squirming at the prospect of being sent into battle.\n\nIn a move that seals his fate, Cage rejects an order by Commanding Officer General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) to join a large-scale, D-Day-like aerial invasion of France. His reward is a demotion to recruit followed by what amounts to, well, a mission impossible.\n\nHe's bellowed at by an unsympathetic Master Sergeant (Bill Paxton), dumped into an infantry unit and handed a heavy-duty exo-suit he has no idea how to operate. The soldiers are dropped onto a beach in Normandy, where they are massacred by the vastly superior multi-limbed aliens, called Mimics. Cage manages to kill an Alpha Mimic and is splattered with its \"blood\" before he is killed himself. He then wakes up at the start of the same day, and goes through the same sequence of events until his violent death.\n\nWith the knowledge gained from reliving events over and over again, Cage is able to stay alive for just a little bit longer each time until Rita (Emily Blunt), a toned, tough-as-nails fighter whose own death precedes his, realises that Cage is caught in the loop. \"When you wake up, come look for me,\" she tells him.\n\nRita has been through the same experience but thanks to a blood transfusion, she is no longer able to defy death. She helps by getting Cage combat-ready but it's up to him to figure out how to stay alive long enough to take out the Mimics' brain centre - known as the Omega - and save the day, so to speak.\n\nEdge of Tomorrow, directed by Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity) from a script by Christopher McQuarrie, Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth, is based on All You Need is Kill, a 2004 novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. It's smarter and sharper than the average blockbuster, and the action is intense and virtually non-stop. It also conveys a decent sense of humour.\n\nGiven the film's sensibilities - Groundhog Day (1993) meets Saving Private Ryan (1998) with a splash of Back to the Future (1985) - Edge of Tomorrow stays somewhat less than predictable. This is a movie where Cruise turns back the clock - in more ways than one.\n\nRating:\n\nB\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jun 6, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWHAT'S popping up even more than the never-ending stream of new cafes that seem to open almost every week? Pop-up spaces that is - one-off, temporary stores or events selling fashion, food, handicraft and a myriad lifestyle options.\n\nBut in a growing scene where there are more pop-up ideas than venues to hold them in, one player is putting a new spin on the concept.\n\nShophouse & Co - a curatorial and consultancy firm - works closely with the creative community and saw how many of their bright ideas were diminished by not having the space to hold their events, be it an exhibition, retail or workshop space.\n\n\"A major hurdle they face is high rental and startup costs when starting their projects,\" says Stella Gwee, director of Shophouse & Co.\n\nTeaming up with the firm's creative director, Adib Jalal, the duo started Transitional___by Shophouse & Co, a site-specific temporal setup, to overcome this problem.\n\nMs Gwee sees many under-utilised sites around Singapore, so \"we contacted these landlords to pitch the idea of activating the sites for the creative community to make use of. By doing so, the idea is that both the landlord and the creatives become partners in building a vibrant community in these spaces.\"\n\nTransitional ___ will mark its debut at 115 King George's Avenue. The loft-like space takes up the ground level of a six-storey building owned by The Bamboo Group, a property group that supports the community through their developments.\n\n\"Rather than leave the space empty, they're letting us use the space for free,\" says Ms Gwee. Transitional___ at 115 KG began on May 24 and will run till June 22. While it joins the likes of other pop-up stores such as Temporium and Nong, Ms Gwee is quick to point out that they are not a retail store.\n\n\"We do not sell anything. Rather, we provide the platform for other parties to use the space.\"\n\nCurated experience\n\nHence, Shophouse & Co has collaborated with Naiise. The online retailer for well-designed products has set up a temporary shop at the King George's premises, selling locally designed goods and food items. Another creative group that Shophouse & Co is collaborating with is Tyrwhitt General Company to organise crafting workshops.\n\nShophouse & Co collects a fee from vendors who retail or sell a service, \"but otherwise, we keep things free,\" she says. \"For example, an artist who wants a place to show but not sell his paintings can do so here without having to pay a cent.\"\n\nShe adds that the pop-up space works well for \"vendors who wouldn't otherwise be able to afford rent, or start-ups who want to have a feel of the surroundings.\"\n\nMs Gwee goes on to say that \"the possibilities for use of a Transitional___ space are endless, such as creating a performance space for a theatre group\". She declines to reveal more for now, but says the next site could be in the Duxton Road area.\n\nAlready, Transitional___ is a win-win situation for both Shophouse & Co and The Bamboo Group. The pop-up space has brought more crowds to the area over the weekends, and a tenant has already been confirmed to take up the space when Transitional___ vacates.\n\nThis is the second pop-up store for Naiise, after a successful one at Nong at People's Park Complex earlier this year.\n\nNaiise founder Dennis Tay says that rather than a permanent shop, pop-ups work for him because, \"I can create different concepts for each shop.\" At Transitional___ at 115 KG, the Naiise pop-up store takes on a more industrial look, as Mr Tay took decor inspiration from the many hardware stores in the area.\n\nHaving a pop-up store, \"allows customers to touch and feel the products, which they can't do when shopping online,\" he says.\n\nAnother online retailer that is jumping onto the pop-up store concept is local fashion label, Matter.\n\nRather than set up a full-fledged pop-up retail space, the newly launched brand works with just a small cart. Matter's Nomad Cart first showed up last month at Wanderlust hotel. Unlike other brands which pop up then disappear, the Nomad Cart is going places. The cart is now at Pact at Orchard Central, and will show up at another three more locations till next month. Matter doesn't pay to place its cart at these spots.\n\nMatter's co-founder Renyung Ho says that the \"travelling Nomad Cart was conceptualised in lieu of a launch party to develop initial brand awareness and complement the online experience. We have a separate showroom but viewings are by appointment only so the travelling pop-up gives us room to have a bit of fun with a physical showcase.\"\n\nBesides a small selection of items for sale, customers can browse books on India's textile history, handle handcarved block prints, and see up-close the dyes used for Matter's inaugural edition of trousers.\n\n\"Online sales still make up the bulk of our business as the cart is more of a travelling brand showcase than a retail point but the cart has generated interest and awareness for the brand and is a great way for people to meet Matter for the first time besides building word-of-mouth,\" says Ms Ho.\n\nWhile pop-up stores are popular with online retailers, even physical stores are doing pop-ups.\n\nHipster store The Redundant Shop has its home at Everton Park, but has a pop-up store at the lobby of the Wanderlust Hotel till June 22, and is planning to do more.\n\nPauline Chung, its partnership manager, says, \"it is not possible to reach out to everyone through the Everton Park shop, so we toyed with the idea of a temporary space to help us bring our Redundant brand out in another way.\"\n\nThe pop-up shop carries an exclusive range of Redundant merchandise and stationery that are not yet available at the Everton Park store - to attract new customers. In turn, home appliances distributor APS Lifestyle has also turned its gallery into a pop-up shop, with its second edition of 9 Muthuraman Chetty Market - named after its address - or 9MCM.\n\nInvited merchants\n\nThis year, it invited merchants such as Rokeby Bistro, Habitat Coffee and A.muse Projects to sell food, alongside lifestyle brands such as MandyT Skincare and Four and Twenty. Elaine Ong, spokesman of 9MCM, sees pop-ups as a new form of advertising. She isn't worried if customers come to the gallery but leave without buying any SMEG or Whirlpool appliances which APS carries.\n\n\"What APS wants is not the 'in-your-face' kind of marketing. 9MCM is a subtle way to let customers know about our gallery and the brands we carry,\" she says. \"As long as customers leave knowing that our gallery exists and APS Lifestyle carries kitchen appliances, that is good enough.\"\n\nShe adds that by supporting local merchants through 9MCM, \"the merchants that we bring in indirectly represent us as well, so it is good that we are associated with these hip bistros and brands.\"\n\nLouis Tan, spokesman for pop-up bar Mixes from Mars at Duxton Hotel says that setting up a pop-up bar is \"usually cheaper\" and it was an opportunity for average folks such as him and his partners to get into the business.\n\nMixes from Mars opened last December and will close this December when the hotel undergoes renovations. Despite the bar doing brisk business on weekends, Mr Tan says the team has no fixed plans to re-open. \"It depends on the market and whether we can get a good deal on a location.\"\n\nFor now, Ms Chung believes that the pop up is still going strong.\n\n\"The ability to 'pop up' unannounced, quickly draw in the crowds, and then disappear or morph into something else, adds to the fresh feel, exclusivity and surprise that commercial shops or malls cannot provide,\" she says. \"From the business perspective, it allows small companies to tap into a new market at low cost and to reduce inventory. From the consumers' perspective, it is an alternative to aggressive commercialism.\"\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\n@TaySuanChiangBT\n\nBlink and you'll miss them\n\nTransitional ___\n\n115KG, 115 King George's Avenue\n\nNow till June 22; 12 to 7pm daily\n\nTransitional___ works with vendors from the design community to provide them with a space to showcase their products or services. In this first edition, fans of online store Naiise can buy a selection of items comprising industrial home accents, locally upcycled products, local designs, homemade food and other home and desk accessories.\n\nOn the weekends, there are workshops by Tyrwhitt General Company and The Wholesome Co where to learn leather crafting or to grow an edible garden. Kitchen specialist Mudian Crafted has also fitted out a kitchen complete with an oven, stove, fridge and microwave, which works as a showroom for the firm.\n\nThe Redundant Shop Pop Up\n\nWanderlust, 2 Dickson Road\n\nNow till June 22; 9am to 8pm daily\n\nWell-known hipster store The Redundant Shop is taking a little of itself out of its Everton Park home into Little India.\n\nIt has teamed up with boutique hotel firm Unlisted Collection to house a pop-up store in the lobby of Wanderlust. The pop-up store will retail goods from local labels such as Second Kings, Word, Ang Ku Kueh Girl, Books Actually, Casey Chen, Second Helpings FIN and Good News & Co.\n\nThe items are displayed in toolboxes and tool carts, to pay homage to independent makers and businesses that take pride in their work, and to raise awareness and appreciation of craftsmanship and independent business.\n\nThere's also a live silk-screen workshop demonstration by The Redundant Workshop team on June 21 and 22, where participants can silk-screen print their very own tote bags with the help of Redundant Workshop trainers.\n\nMatter Nomad Cart\n\nPact, Orchard Central, #02-16 to 19\n\nToday and tomorrow; 11am to 10pm daily\n\nOnline fashion label Matter recently launched its first collection which focuses on trousers. To help raise awareness, it is holding a series of pop-up stores in several locations across Singapore.\n\nThe first pop-up cart was at Wanderlust hotel, but since May 30, the cart moved to collaborative space Pact at Orchard Central. The cart is there until tomorrow, before moving to another location, which will be revealed at a later date. Matter's Tussar silk cotton travel trousers come in three styles: sideswept dhoti, reworked harem and classic wideleg.\n\n9 MCM\n\nAPS Lifestyle Gallery\n\n9 Muthuraman Chetty Road\n\nJune 21, 10am to 9pm\n\nFollowing the success of its first pop-up marketplace event last year, home appliances distributor APS Lifestyle is bringing back 9 Muthuraman Chetty Market, or 9 MCM. This year, the number of merchants will double to about 25.\n\nThere's plenty of food for sale, such as fish and chips from Rokeby Bistro, coffee from Habitat Coffee, and old-fashioned Australian ice cream sandwiches by Pat and Stick. For extra comfort, there'll be seating areas with tables and chairs made from wooden pallets. This year's edition will also include fashion and lifestyle product retailers. Among them are MandyT, a chemical-free and plant-based local skincare brand, vintage fashion label Whole9Yards, menswear label Sifr, and floral bouquet company Elle & Becks.\n\nCafe Fest Singapore\n\nMarina Bay Waterfront Promenade\n\nSept 6, 10am to 8pm; Sept 7, 10am to 7pm\n\nCafe hoppers can get a caffeine high at Cafe Fest Singapore, which brings together 12 cafes in one location. Participants include Maison Ikkoku, Oz Specialty Coffee and Cake Love. Each cafe will set up its own booth, retailing cafe fare from coffee to cupcakes and pastries.\n\nBy Tay Suan Chiang\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Keep this World Cup players' guide handy so you don't get tongue-tied when the lunch or water-cooler conversation over the next few weeks inevitably gets steered towards the world's most-watched sporting event.\n\nDylan Tan\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Jun 5, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nHulk (Brazil)\n\nNot the green beast from the Marvel comic but equally incredible; the Brazilian winger (who was born with the less-catchy name of Givanildo Vieira de Souza) boasts a physique as buff as Lou Ferrigno, the bodybuilder-turned-actor who played the Hulk on TV in the late 1970s. The 27-year-old is unlikely to turn green on the pitch but with the jerseys of both Cameroon and Mexico - who are in the same group as Brazil - in that colour, that should bring out the goal monster in him.\n\nWhat to say:\n\n'Hulk is not only a great player; he's also very vocal in speaking out against racism and homophobia despite playing in Zenit St Petersburg, the allegedly racist top-flight Russian club that has never signed any non-white players until recently.'\n\nWhat not to say:\n\n'I don't really like Hulk; I prefer Thor.'\n\nRobin van Persie (Netherlands)\n\nAs long as he's not on the treatment table, van Persie (RvP) is a bona fide goalscoring machine and has become the Netherlands' all-time top-scorer - a milestone he achieved from a hat-trick during the Oranje's ruthless 8-1 drubbing of Hungary in last year's World Cup qualifiers. But everybody knows the Arsenal traitor is arguably the most fragile footballer on the planet and an injury-stricken season with Manchester United left the club with a goal drought.\n\nWhat to say:\n\n'RvP must be looking to impress Dutch national coach Louis van Gaal since he (van Gaal) is also Manchester United's new manager.'\n\nWhat not to say:\n\n'Robin van Persie? What sort of car is that?'\n\nLuis Suarez (Uruguay)\n\nIt's still a little iffy if the prolific Uruguayan record goalscorer will be participating in the tournament after undergoing a minor knee operation but if he doesn't, you can count on the World Cup to have a little less drama. The 27-year-old is a magnet for trouble and has crossed swords with opponents more often than the Workers Party in Parliament. From his theatrical dives inside the six-yard box to giving visiting fans the finger; and punching, biting and racially abusing his opponents, Suarez makes even the hardest English football hooligans look like a bunch of kindergarten kids.\n\nWhat to say:\n\n'Suarez's blatant handball which stopped a goal-bound Ghana shot that would have allowed the Africans to progress to the semifinals of the 2010 World Cup is the real 'Hand of God'.'

Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund currently allocates the bulk of the investments, or 60 per cent, to Japanese government bonds.\n\nSingapore does not have a pension fund. Money in the savings accounts under CPF earn an interest rate that takes reference from Singapore government bonds and market rates, though there are legislated minimum rates to be earned by CPF account holders. This is critical in the current low interest-rate environment.\n\nThe urgency for change in Japan comes as the country, with the world's oldest population, found itself doling out more benefit payments than it receives in contributions to fund the eventual payouts.\n\nEach Japanese household is entitled to pension payouts equivalent to over 50 per cent of the average income of the working generation, for all of the retirement years, with a couple making up a Japanese household expected to live through one century.\n\nIn Singapore, the net income replacement rate - a metric by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that measures the rate at which a person's CPF payouts can replace his pre-retirement income, after accounting for income taxes and other contributions to social security, where relevant - is about 40 per cent of the median income of a man here, a 2013 OECD pension report showed.\n\nPre-retirement income includes an individual's average wage earning, and rent from housing, OECD said.\n\nAs a close-to-home reference, Malaysia's Employees Provident Fund (EPF) had drastically cut its allocation to Malaysia's sovereign bonds to about 25 per cent as at 2011, down from about 85 per cent in 1985, a report from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch showed.\n\nIn 2011, about 35 per cent of EPF was held in equities. This is up from 3 per cent in 1985.\n\nThe UK has also proposed reforms in recent months that effectively hand retirees much greater autonomy over their pension funds. Pensioners who come under the new scheme - which comes into force next year - will no longer be forced to buy an annuity.\n\nThis contrasts with Singapore's move into annuities. Since last year, most Singaporeans have been put on an annuity programme, under which a stipulated minimum sum from the CPF retirement account is invested in return for a monthly payout for the retirement years.\n\nThere are now calls to ensure that payouts from Singapore's annuity scheme - known as CPF Life - accounts for inflation.\n\nWith the UK scrapping its annuity scheme, most pensioners there should then be able to draw out all of their pension at a go.\n\nThe lump sum that can be drawn out at age 55 has been raised to \u00a330,000 (S$63,000) from \u00a318,000, and the size of the average pension in the UK is around the limit, according to media reports.\n\nOver in Denmark, which topped the Melbourne Mercer Global Pension Index last year, the government had also reviewed its retirement package in a period of European austerity.\n\nThese included raising the age of early retirement to 62 from 60 - effectively shortening the gap with the official retirement age of 65 to three years.\n\nIn the US, there are calls to reform the Social Security scheme - funded by US payroll taxes - which is expected to exhaust its reserves by 2033 because spending has outpaced funding. There are suggestions from think tanks to cut the quantum of future benefit increases, especially for those who are not poor.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The question of what kind of cities the people of 2050 will find themselves living in was tackled at the recently concluded World Cities Summit (WCS) here.\n\nThe general consensus was that a \"smart city\" would be one that is green, sustainable and liveable.\n\n\"The ultimate achievement for a city is to earn unconditional respect from people all over the world, for our people, our city and our country,\" said Liu Thai Ker, chairman of the Centre for Liveable Cities (CLC), during his closing remarks.\n\nHe told delegates that a city, which was in a way the largest piece of industrial design made by man, would be judged on its user-friendliness, functionality and aesthetics.\n\nOver 130 mayors and city leaders, along with representatives of international organisations, researchers and urban planners, attended the four-day summit to discuss strategies on how to develop liveable, more resilient and attractive cities for urban residents worldwide.\n\nThey emphasised the need for governments to collaborate more closely with businesses, academia and citizen networks to create more holistic and cost-effective solutions that improve the quality of life.\n\nSenior Minister of State for National Development Lee Yi Shyan said during the closing plenary that cities which invest in IT infrastructure, educational and training capacity to raise IT literacy, the adoption of open data and deployment of various \"intelligent systems\" could harness public opinions, and promote co-ownership of problems, and co-creation of solutions.\n\n\"In such instances, the government need not be the sole solution provider, and neither can it, because there is potential for greater creative capacity in the people and private sector in devising solutions to help city residents deal with day-to-day problems,\" he said.\n\nSome partnerships announced at this year's WCS have already put that goal into action. One of them was a memorandum of understanding between the Housing & Development Board (HDB), the Energy Market Authority and Panasonic to study the feasibility of establishing a smart-home energy pilot to provide households with more energy choices and solutions.\n\nThe year-long study will explore various energy solutions - such as time-of-use pricing where electricity is cheaper during off-peak hours, and home-energy management systems which provide energy usage data to encourage behavioural change - for HDB households in the future.\n\n\"As electricity demand increases, energy management technologies and solutions are becoming more important than ever,\" said Junichiro Kitagawa, managing director of Panasonic Asia Pacific. \"We hope that such synchronised private-public efforts will create a better life and a better world for all.\"\n\nTransport solutions also featured in the conversations at WCS, with a focus on driverless vehicles.\n\nSMRT International signed an exclusive agreement with technology provider 2getthere on Monday for an introduction of the latter's driverless transit systems in Singapore.\n\n\"We are keen to introduce such driverless transportation technology in Singapore where there are manpower challenges,\" said Goh Eng Kiat, managing director at SMRT International, adding that the company expects to participate in trial rollouts.\n\nHe added that the system can complement existing bus services through last-mile connectivity for commuters, and also has the ability to address on-demand transport requirements, while providing an energy-saving and green transportation solution.\n\nBesides motorised transport, CLC is also looking to encourage active mobility. A joint study released by CLC and the US-based Urban Land Institute on Monday identified strategies to promote walking and cycling in tropical cities.\n\nTen recommendations were provided for active travel, such as ensuring visibility at road junctions by painting cycling lanes and continuous sidewalks that require cars to stop and allow pedestrians and cyclists to continue.\n\nCLC's executive director Khoo Teng Chye said that besides a change in the urban environment, active mobility required a change in mindset as well. \"As CEO and chief planner of URA in the 1990s, I was sceptical of whether cycling can be a viable form of transport, because of our hot and humid weather, for example.\"\n\nBut he pointed to cities such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam that have 80 per cent of their people cycling both in winter and summer to get around.\n\n\"Many cities are now planning and providing infrastructure for cycling. They have developed much expertise and we should learn from them, rather than reinvent the wheel,\" said Mr Khoo.\n\nOther recent studies also indicate that the ability to innovate and adjust to changes across the board is the key to a successful city with high quality of life.\n\nA joint CLC-Shell report titled \"New Lenses on Future Cities\" released last month cited flexible long-term planning, investing in the future and collaboration between sections of society as some of the crucial conditions cities should have in order to respond promptly to emerging crises.\n\nIn particular, the report emphasised the importance of an efficient transport system that goes hand in hand with a compact city design, and raised the Republic as a positive example of a city that took and continues to take decisive steps for its long-term physical development.\n\nThe results of another study - PwC's \"Cities of Opportunity\", which ranks 30 global cities across 10 indicators - also highlighted the need for cities to \"actively sweat the details on virtually every aspect of urban policy and organisation\".\n\nOf the cities ranked in the top 10 overall, nine were ranked in the top 10 as well for at least five indicators.\n\nSingapore finished third overall behind London and New York and was also top for the transportation and infrastructure indicator.\n\nThe fourth edition of the WCS was held together with the Singapore International Water Week and the CleanEnviro Summit Singapore. More than 20,000 participants from 118 countries attended the three co-located events.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

SIAS will study the current situation, and if it warrants that their concerns should be highlighted to the regulators, with a view to improve the communication to the investors, it will do so.\"\n\nThe statement was prompted by minority shareholders of property developer LCD Global Investments complaining to SIAS about an ongoing takeover offer for the company.\n\nBrothers Raymond and David Lum, who control about 32 per cent of LCD's shares, are making a 17 cent per share offer for the company. Shares of LCD Global closed at 25.5 cents yesterday.\n\nProvenance Capital, which was hired by LCD's independent directors to provide independent advice on the deal, in May deemed the offer \"fair from the historical market share price perspective\", but \"not so compelling\" with respect to Provenance's estimate of LCD's net asset value of 27.2 cents per share.\n\nLCD independent directors accepted Provenance's advice for long-term shareholders to reject the offer, and for short-term shareholders to accept or to sell on the market if they can get a better price.\n\nSIAS said it understood shareholders' dissatisfaction with the offer price, and noted that it had already urged the offeror to raise its offer.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The former - thin yellow noodles in a slightly starchy clear broth - is based on his grandpa's hand-me-down recipe while the latter is chef Zheng's circa 2014 re-interpretation, which works with half-boiled egg, lard and a sprinkle of ikan bilis over ribbons of kway tiao.\n\nChar Siew\n\n$5 for 100g with a minimum order of 300g\n\nChar, 393 Guillemard Road\n\nTel 6842 7759\n\nYOU'D be forgiven if you thought the char siew from Char was, well, charred. Instead of the artificial bright red food colouring that Cantonese noodle shops typically use to tart up their barbecued pork, Char's version is all black and tarry in appearance - and doesn't really strike you until a first bite yields ultra-tender pork meat slicked over with a beautifully caramelised, molasses-textured glaze. The \"angmoh char siew\", as some have labelled it, is prepped with a combination of Western and Chinese cooking techniques, and over 10 spices from both larders, says Char owners and Birmingham-raised brothers Anthony and Alvin Ung.\n\nSalted Egg Steamed Crab, $88\n\nNaked Finn, 41 Malan Road #01-13\n\nGillman Barracks\n\nTel 6694 0807\n\nA combination of two popular ways of eating crab - steamed Teochew-style and coated in salted egg yolk - Naked Finn's latest menu addition comprises brown crab from Scotland steamed with salted egg yolk and served with a bright ginger vinegar dip. Think crabs are too fussy to eat? Happily, the crabs are served dressed, that is, its meat already extracted by deft kitchen hands and stuffed back into its salted egg yolk-lined shell. It is then steamed in its own protein-rich juices, which form a flavourful chawanmushi-like layer that caps the dish - no seasoning required. Each portion contains about 750g to 850g of crabmeat and three salted egg yolks, and is so rich, it is best shared among a group of two to four people.

Odd as the dish may sound on paper, it actually works on the palate: intensely peppery on the first sip, the combination of glutamate-rich Sri Lankan crab chunks with the intensely peppery and nucleotide-saturated pork rib broth then coaxes out the umami flavour, which is followed by a sweet, lingering aftertaste.\n\nSingapore Breakfast\n\npart of the degustation menu, $138 per person\n\nLabyrinth, 5 Neil Road\n\nTel 6223 4098\n\nGO ahead, have dessert for breakfast at Labyrinth, where head chef Han Liguang's sweet treat of wobbly vanilla panna cotta and yolk-yellow mango puree has been cheekily disguised as the typical kopitiam breakfast of soft-boiled eggs.

And thirdly, the co-payment component (to be paid by patients) has been reduced significantly,\" he said.\n\nHe added, however, that workers were concerned about whether and by how much these changes would raise MediShield Life premiums, and whether they would be able to afford the cost of being covered.\n\n\"But, what was said (on Thursday by the government) that was quite reassuring was that, even with the increase in premiums, with the one percentage-point increase in Medisave contribution (by employers) from next year (and various government subsidies and Medisave top-ups), most families will be able to pay for the new premiums using their Medisave and without having to come out with cash. This is very reassuring to workers, but we look forward to more details,\" Mr Lim added.\n\nHe also pointed out that the recommended changes to MediShield Life would mean more duplication of terms and benefits between that scheme and company-based group insurance. Companies should thus make adjustments to their group insurance schemes so they are a better complement to MediShield Life.\n\nHe added that the PMBS could work as a bridge between MediShield Life and companies' group insurance schemes.\n\n\"We believe the introduction of MediShield Life is very timely (in that it allows) us to refocus on our objective of introducing the PMBS. The labour movement has been promoting and advocating this for some years, but the response has been fairly limited.\n\n\"Now, with the recommended changes to MediShield Life, the duplication (between company insurance and MediShield Life) is even greater; it gives us more scope to reduce the duplication, and thereby make the whole healthcare benefits system more affordable and more attractive to our workers.\"\n\nAt the Future Leaders Summit, Mr Lim also spoke on the challenges facing PMEs (professionals, managers and executives). Among these is the need for PMEs to change jobs - not because they are lured by better wages and career prospects - but because the economy is continually upgrading.\n\nHe said that to prepare for their future, PMEs should not only acquire deep vertical skills; they should also focus on \"second skilling\" and \"horizontal skilling\".\n\n\"It is better for our PMEs to not only know many things about something, but also to know something about many things,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In addition, to help offset costs, from next year, the employer contribution to Medisave will rise by one percentage point, as announced in the Singapore Budget 2014. The government added that it will ensure that Medisave withdrawal limits are sufficient for all MediShield Life premiums.\n\nA range of subsidies, financial assistance, and other forms of funding support for the lower to middle-income classes (this constitutes up to two-thirds of the population) will also be a \"permanent feature\" of the scheme. For the Pioneer Generation, the premium subsidies will be for life.\n\nSeparately, transitional subsidies will be extended to all Singapore citizens, regardless of income, over four years, to help Singaporeans adjust to the premium increases.\n\nMeanwhile, the Life Insurance Association, Singapore (LIA) also announced that the MediShield Life recommendations will have a minimal impact on the private insurance premiums component of Integrated Shield Plans. Integrated Shield Plans are policies that provide additional benefits beyond MediShield coverage; some 60 per cent of all Singaporeans have Integrated Shield Plans.\n\nThe Labour Movement also voiced its support for MediShield Life, but added that it is important to ensure its relevance.\n\n\"As the biggest employer in Singapore, the government could lead by example and increase its one per cent Additional Medisave Contribution in the existing Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient (MSO) Scheme to cater for premiums and medical costs,\" said the National Trades Union Congress in a statement. \"Similar, other employers can make additional Medisave contributions to boost workers' ability to pay for MediShield Life premiums,\" it added.\n\nAnother area to look into is that of a tiered withdrawal scheme for Medisave where older Singaporeans, depending on their age, are allowed to withdraw more compared to younger Singaporeans for outpatient needs, said Halimah Yacob, chair of the PAP.SG committee.\n\n\"This will help our seniors with sufficient Medisave balances as they will not have to pay cash when they visit the outpatient clinics which is a drain on them,\" she said.\n\nThe MediShield Life Review Committee is expected to release its final report by end-June. The government will then respond to the committee's full recommendations and share details of the finalised premiums and subsidiaries by early July.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Delta reinstituted a dividend last year, after a decade-long break that included a bankruptcy and the acquisition of Northwest Airlines. Dallas-based Southwest has paid a dividend since 1976.\n\nAmerican has reduced its shares outstanding since the merger by settling a convertible note and paying tax withholdings for employees in lieu of issuing common stock as compensation under its bankruptcy reorganisation plan.\n\nThe steps amount to a US$710 million return of capital to shareholders, Mr Parker said.\n\nThe carrier has a debt covenant that limits what it can do in the way of share repurchases or dividends unless it refinances the note. If the company waits until next March to refinance, a make-whole provision in the note would not apply, chief financial officer Derek Kerr has said.\n\nMr Parker told shareholders at the New York meeting that the airline is likely to exceed its US$1 billion estimate for merger revenue synergies from combining networks, winning back corporate contracts and other steps.\n\n\"So far, we believe we are going to exceed that target,\" he said.\n\nThe airline previously said that it had identified other ways since the merger that could generate US$400 million more with moves such as adding seats to some aircraft models. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Favreau, who wrote, directed and stars in Chef, doesn't make any attempt to push the creative envelope because there's always another time and place - and movie - for that.\n\nThis time around, it feels like he simply wanted to get together with some celebrity buddies (including Dustin Hoffman, Scarlett Johansson and Robert Downey Jr in cameo roles) and hit the road for a bit of culinary fun - while weighing in on some current trends along the way.\n\nFavreau clearly enjoys his food, and it's not his generous girth we're talking about. There are big names in the cast but food is the undisputed star of the show. From the opening scene depicting celebrity chef Carl Casper (Favreau) doing prep work and crafting a meal in his LA restaurant, this film is a visual feast. By the end, it will have you licking your lips and going through a mental checklist of your favourite dishes.\n\nThere are times when Chef feels like a blend of The Food Network and The Discovery Channel, with basic instructions on how to start a food truck business thrown in for good measure. Not surprising, since the LA chef and food truck guru Roy Choi - founder of Kogi BBQ - schooled the cast on kitchen culture and food truck ways.\n\nThe film also tackles the influence of Twitter on the modern-day food scene, showing how a tweet from anyone with a loyal following - from a powerful food critic to a blog-savvy 10-year-old kid - can help to make or break a chef's career.\n\nLike many chefs with an ounce of talent, Carl loves to cook - but he also needs to impress his audience, including the important food critic Ramsey Michel (Oliver Platt) who comes to dine in his chic eatery one evening.\n\nProblem is, the restaurant's owner (Hoffman) insists that Carl stick to his signature items, those tried-and-tested dishes (like chocolate lava cake) that diners love - but which fail to fire the imagination.\n\nAfter Michel pans the food - and the chef - with a brutal tweet, Carl responds by going ballistic, while his right-back-at-you tweet goes viral.\n\nPretty soon, Carl is trending like crazy but he's also out of a job and down in the dumps, so it's left to ex-wife Inez (Sofia Vergara) and their Twitter-knowing young son Percy (Emjay Anthony) to pick up the slack.\n\nThe solution: Cuban sandwiches and starting over by going the food truck route. In Miami, the city where he first attracted Michel's attention, Carl refurbishes a rickety food truck and heads back across the country with Percy and a chirpy chef pal (John Leguizamo).\n\nIt's a father-son bonding exercise coupled with a whirlwind tour of the American South and classic Southern cuisine.\n\nThe food scenes elicit the desired audience response and the film also gets a major boost from the great soundtrack.\n\nChef is an easily digestible morsel that gives us an entertaining glimpse of the American food scene.

The band, consisting of lead singer Kazu Makino and twin brothers Simone and Amedeo Pace, had announced in March that they had finished a new album, but have since been mum about the title and release details.\n\nThey will, however, be touring Asia, making stops in Taiwan, the Philippines, China and Singapore, where they will be performing as part of the line-up for urban music festival Hostess Club Weekender.\n\nOver the phone, drummer and singer Simone Pace guarantees their fans will be in for a surprise. \"We've been working on the new album, and we'll be playing some of the new songs on this tour. It's sort of a promotional tour and preview.\"\n\nThe last time Blonde Redhead was in Singapore in 2011, while promoting their album Penny Sparkle, but Pace says their sound has changed since quite a bit. \"It's a bit more electronic, a bit more instrumental music,\" he explains. \"There are quite a few new elements, so I'm really excited about it. I think our music has evolved.\"\n\nAlthough their music has been described as dream pop and indie, Pace says they prefer not to label it. \"For us, it's just our music, what we like and play; we don't like to name it, I think that restricts it,\" he adds. \"Music, I think, is relative. For you it might sound like dream pop, for someone else it might be indie - it's up to the listeners.\"\n\nPace says they draw inspiration from experiences in life - for example, their album Misery Is a Butterfly had several songs inspired by Makino's accident with a horse.\n\n\"Kazu writes the lyrics, I just sing and play them,\" he laughs. \"But, like our sound, the lyrics' meanings are relative too. To listeners, it might sound like a love song, but to Kazu, it might be a song about her horse!\"\n\nThe band are excited to be back on the road, and Pace says they are very happy with where they are now, and what they are doing in terms of music. It's been quite a long road to recognition, but he says he never thought of anything else. \"When I was younger, I already knew I wanted to pursue music seriously,\" he reveals, and adds that staying true to their sound has helped the band get to where they are today since forming in 1993. \"Our music is not really influenced by anyone else but ourselves.\"\n\nBlonde Redhead will be performing at Hostess Club Weekender on June 14, at Infinite Studios.

Who would have thought Hollywood's notorious man-child would decide it's time to act his age with recent efforts such as the Grown Ups duology and That's My Boy all finding him maturing every so slightly and displaying a more sensitive adult side.\n\nBlended, a new rom-com which pairs the 47-year-old comedian with Drew Barrymore for the third time after The Wedding Singer (1998) and 50 First Dates (2004), could well be Sandler's family-friendliest live-action film (bar his animated hit Hotel Transylvania) to date. It also reunites them with Singer's director Frank Coraci.\n\nPredictable but sweet on the whole, Blended's main draw is the easy chemistry between the two leads and neither disappoints, drawing laughs effortlessly with their natural comic talents.\n\nSandler fans need not be totally disappointed because even with its PG rating, screenwriters Ivan Menchell and Clare Sera have slipped more than a handful of crude jokes into the script for those who bought a ticket expecting some Old School Sandler.\n\nThe Brady-Bunch-styled storyline finds Barrymore and Sandler playing Lauren and Jim respectively, single parents who first meet on a blind date so disastrous they decide they're never going to see anybody again. But as a Hollywood comedy plot and a healthy suspension of disbelief would have it, both of them coincidentally run into each other again when they end up holidaying in the same African resort - this time complete with their kids in tow.\n\nJim is the widower who has no idea how to raise his three daughters after his wife dies of cancer. His clueless-ness extends to him naming the girls Larry (short for Hilary), Espn (like the sports cable network) and Lou.\n\nLauren herself doesn't fair any better in the parenting department after her jerk of an ex-husband (Joel McHale from the sitcom Community) abandons the family and leaves her to raise two boys - a rambunctious nine-year-old and a puberty-stricken teenager with a porn obsession - on her own.\n\nOpposites attract in more ways than one as Jim bonds with Lauren's father-figure-less boys through sports while Lauren gives Jim's tomboy girls makeovers.\n\nAs expected, both adults also slowly forget about their bad start and things get a little mushy near the end though a running gag involving the ample bosom of a fellow resort guest is firm reminder that Blended may be marketed primarily as a family and date movie, but it never really leaves Sandler's signature bad taste territory.\n\nRating:\n\nC+\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Latam, the region's biggest airline, has operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay and Peru.\n\nAircraft maintenance workers from LAN Peru have threatened strike action over demands for better pay, after negotiations with the airline broke down last week.\n\nA union leader in Lima, Freddy Nakashima, said that around 250 to 300 technicians would go on strike in Peru, an action which he said would paralyse the country's network.\n\nNo date has been decided yet, but the aim would be to hold a strike when it would affect the World Cup in order to apply pressure, Mr Nakashima, said, adding that the strike would go ahead even if approval from the Labour Ministry was not received.\n\nUnion members posted photos on Facebook on Wednesday showing them handing out leaflets at Buenos Aires' Ezeiza airport.

Directed by Lee Kung Lo, it is already one of the highest-grossing films in Hong Kong this year, collecting HK$18 million (S$3 million) at the box office.\n\nLike the original film, the adult entertainment industry is once again spoofed but the focus this time shifts from soft-porn magazines to adult films instead. As an added bonus, six real-life Japanese female porn stars - Anri Okita, Maiko Yuki, Kana Yume, Nozomi Aso, Tsukasa Aoi and Yui Tatsum - have cameos (by that, it just means they drop their clothes on-screen).\n\nThe always-versatile and funny Chapman To plays Wyman, a freelance writer who loses his gig writing erotica for a newspaper. A visit to the set of an adult film shoot while on holiday in Tokyo, however, leads to him standing in for a disgruntled actor who leaves in a huff.\n\nWhen news of that eventually reaches Hong Kong, Wyman turns into an overnight Internet sensation. He relocates to Japan where he turns into full-time porn star Mario Ozawa (a play on popular Japanese adult video star Maria Ozawa's name), and is managed by Cuzuki Hatoyama (Josie Ho), an acquaintance who has a little history of her own. Wyman's reign, however, is threatened when cocky newcomer Nagasaki Naoki (Louis Koo) appears on the scene.\n\nWritten by Chan Hing Ka, whose screenwriting credits include A Better Tomorrow, 3D Naked Ambition, as one would expect, titillates and stimulates its audience everywhere except their brain cells.\n\nChapman To hamming it up as the accidental porn star who lets things get to his head is about the best thing about the film; next to the parodies of porn films with their ridiculous plots that typically involve crowded public transport and hot female teachers pandering to male fantasies. Too bad the novelty doesn't last and a hurried climax that exposes the plot's lack of ideas leaves 3D Naked Ambition with its pants down.\n\nRating:\n\nC+\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Red, after all, is an insightful play about a mid-20th century artist who made the headlines when he was commissioned to paint a series of murals for New York's famed Four Seasons restaurant.\n\nRothko took two years to work on the commission, then the highest in modern art history, with a young assistant, Ken, in his studio in New York City.\n\nScott-Blackhall explains that she was drawn to the play because she's a fan of biopics. \"I am intrigued by the events that made the person who he or she was - the challenges, the victories and the stories no one even knew about.\"\n\nLogan's play about Rothko covers a very specific period of his life (1958-1959) which many people say informed the next 10 years of his life until his eventual suicide.\n\n\"Besides the challenge of presenting a man as iconic as Rothko, the actors have quite a meaty script to juggle. The dialogue between Rothko and his assistant Ken delves into the history of art, American politics in the 1950s, the culture of a changing and modernising world, the importance of documenting and respecting history, philosophy and how it informs the creating of art,\" she notes.\n\nRed was the winner of the 2010 Tony Award for Best Play; it made its debut at the Donmar Warehouse in London in 2009.\n\n\"The actors and I researched all factual references in the script in order to give meaning and further contextualise through body language and tone for the audience. You can't just say a line without knowing what it means,\" elaborates Scott-Blackhall.\n\nThe play has only two characters - Rothko and his assistant - played by Daniel Jenkins and Gavin Yap respectively.\n\nAs to whether the play is timely, given the rise in visual arts fairs and art investment in Singapore, actor Yap notes that \"any play that deals with art, the importance of art and is able to educate as well as entertain is a play for the times\".\n\nYap, who was last seen in Wild Rice's The Importance of Being Earnest and Pangdemonium's Fat Pig, adds: \"I also feel that we're at a similar crossroads as Rothko was. The 1950s in America was when consumerism was really taking shape after the Second World War and this was also the time when TV and pop art entered the fray. For Rothko, this was all very disposable, nothing he would classify as art.\n\n\"And now, the idea of art and celebrity is even more saturated. As someone who grew up without the Internet and reality television, I completely relate to Rothko's frustrations with the way the world was changing around him because it's not at all far removed from how I feel about, say, The Kardashians.\"\n\nRed is a must-watch for art lovers and Rothko fans (and perhaps even detractors). Scott-Blackhall says that the artist's Bowery Street Studio will be re-created on stage, and there is also a lot of actual painting that takes place on stage.\n\n\"Rothko and Ken are constantly priming canvases, mixing paints and, at one very dynamic point in the play, they fully paint a six foot square canvas with red paint in less than two minutes! It is very exciting to watch!\" she declares.\n\nWhat she and the two actors will be doing is to create a \"space\" and \"atmosphere\" that invite the viewer into the world of the painting, and Rothko's own relationship to art as well.\n\n'Red' by Blank Space Theatre is part of The Esplanade's The Studios season, and will run from July 10-13.

I would constantly paint into the late hours or during weekends, until later I realised I loved the feeling of accomplishment whenever I finished a painting. So I guess working at that company just made me realise how passionate I've always been about art,\" she adds.\n\nAfter working for a couple of years, Park decided to quit her job and embarked on a career as a full-time artist - a gamble that seems to have paid off so far.\n\nIn fact, not long after leaving her job, she did a solo exhibition in Seoul in January 2013, and quickly followed up with one in Hong Kong later that year.\n\nShe has also taken part in group exhibitions in countries like France, Italy and New Caledonia.\n\nAnd next week, the artist's exhibition A Little Talk will be on display here in Singapore at the REDSEA Gallery, with a collection of up to 30 paintings priced from $4,000 to $18,000.\n\nThis series of work showcases various cityscapes painted into calligraphy characters, and is somewhat a record of the cities that Park has travelled to such as Paris, Prague, Florence, Hong Kong, Seoul and most recently, Singapore.\n\nShe explains: \"I like to express my emotions that I derive from my travels through my painting. Each time I travel, yes I feel thrilled and excited, but at the same time, I am lonely. I feel a loneliness lingering in these cities. I want to express these contrasting emotions in my work, hence, one is able to spot this contrast of black and white, Western and Eastern elements that co-exist in them.\"\n\nThese elements Park is referring to are the colourful acrylic paints that outline the cityscapes within the calligraphic brushstrokes which are painted using black Chinese ink on layers of Korean paper.\n\n\"My inspiration comes from travelling to those cities themselves. While painting, I constantly recall my feelings and the weather and the sounds of the city. Doing so makes me very happy because it always feels like I am back there,\" says Park.\n\n\"What I hope is for people who look at my art to be immersed in the city I have created, instead of just experiencing them from a perspective they are already familiar with. I enjoy sharing my emotions and feelings that I get from my travels.\"\n\n'A Little Talk' runs from June 12 to 29 at REDSEA Gallery at 9 Dempsey Road. Opening hours are from 9.30am to 9pm daily.

Here's another way to indulge while raising your cultural profile.\n\nThis weekend at The Star Theatre, a special screening of The Two Towers will be accompanied by nearly 300 musicians on a stage, who will perform the entire film score live while audiences watch the show.\n\nThis is the second time such an event will take place, with the first being a similar screening of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring last year.\n\nThat concert was also performed by Singapore's Metropolitan Festival Orchestra (MFO), and it saw an impressive attendance of over 7,000 people.\n\nOn why they decided to do part two of the show as well, Chan Tze Law, music director of MFO, says it's simply because of popular demand. \"Plus, it is MFO's mission to regularly bring Singapore audiences orchestral offerings that are making waves around the world.\"\n\nFor this year's concert, they have once again invited American conductor Justin Freer, who also did last year's show and was keen to repeat the experience.\n\nProf Chan says: \"I, like many around the world, became fascinated with Tolkien's stories and characters when I was a small child. I adore the musical colours and textures that Howard Shore created for The Two Towers, and of course it's impossible not to fall in love with Gandalf once again when he returns from the 'dead'.\"\n\nPerforming with the MFO will be vocalist Rosalind Waters, the Vocal Associates Festival Chorus, the Children's Choir and boy soprano Samuel Yuen.\n\nIt's a mean feat to be conducting such a massive score, especially for such a famous movie, admits Freer.\n\n\"It is both humbling and exhilarating. . . Due to the sheer amount of music, the vast number of tempo and meter changes and the demand of having to keep everything tightly together over the course of multiple hours, this project comes with a sense of heavy expectation,\" he explains.\n\nBut in the end, what he hopes to do is to give audiences a different experience of this well-loved film, and that this unique presentation format will help more people be aware of the power and impact music can have on film.\n\n\"It is our responsibility to communicate to the audience through Howard's music the myriad of emotions, thoughts and actions coming from the film. If even one person walks away from this concert with a newfound appreciation for film music as an art form, then I would have done my job well,\" he adds.\n\n'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' will be screened today at 7.30pm and tomorrow at 1pm and 7.30pm at The Star Theatre.

It is very likely that the former chief minister of Gujarat is going to turn to East Asia for help to materialise his economic strategy for India, paving the way for Singapore to revitalise its economic engagement with the country.\n\nMr Modi's admiration for East Asia is quite apparent. In his previous position as supremo of Gujarat, he had visited Japan, China and Singapore and declared his respect for their economic success and development. Indeed, going by his development approaches for Gujarat, he may prefer to adopt the East Asian economies' investment-led growth models, rather than, say, Thatcherism or Reaganomics.\n\nIn Asia, Japan is a natural partner, having already established a strategic relationship with India. Notably, Tokyo may well be the destination of the first official trip for the new Indian leader, who's an admirer of Abenomics. Japan, on its part, could see its growing relationship with India as another dimension in its developing strategic nexus against China in Asia. But Mr Modi has made clear that economics, and thus pragmatism, will take centre stage in his foreign-policy considerations. This is likely to frame his engagement of China. Unlike the previous Indian government, which failed to effectively balance its engagement of both Beijing and Washington, Mr Modi is likely to lean towards the growing economic might of China to help spur his country's development.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Following our discussions it occurred to me that there may be others who may have also accumulated a sizeable collection of wines and need help and advice on how best to get the most out of that collection. This week's column attempts to provide guideposts as to what advice to look for and where and how to find it.\n\nPeople who \"collect\" wine fall roughly into two groups. One is made up of people who did not really start off to collect wine. They began by learning to drink wine with their meals, found that they liked the taste and the combination, began to drink wine fairly often with or without their meals and in due course built up a collection of wines initially meant for personal consumption but now has assumed proportions in excess of their needs. They had bought the wines they liked or wanted to drink, then with more experience and confidence the selection became more and more eclectic, and so the collection became larger and larger. Somewhere along the line they had also learnt that buying en primeur made good sense, and their collection then began to include en primeur as well as collector's items! The result after 20 years of this pattern of buying is not difficult to imagine - a collection running into thousands of bottles!\n\nThe other class of wine investor is the true-blue investor, who sets out to build a portfolio of wines in place of stocks and shares. He has heard that wine gives good yields, even better than stocks and shares, and that you never lose because if the wine goes down in price, you can always drink it rather than sell it at a loss - something you cannot do with stocks and shares! It also confers a sort of status symbol to be able to claim that you also invested in wine. Someone like him does not need this column.\n\nWhichever way one starts, there are some fundamentals to distinguish wines from stocks and shares.\n\nJust as in the stock market so it is with the wine market. The most important first thing to learn is WHAT to buy - and, more importantly, WHAT NOT TO BUY. Just as in the stock market, what are the fundamentals? The wine-lover turned wine collector (Group A) looks at this question from a different viewpoint than the pure investor in wine (Group B) whose fundamentals are very, very different.\n\nThe wine lover-cum-collector (Group A) does not bother too much about dry uninteresting facts such as yields, and investment potential. He buys what he wants and likes to drink; he may decide to buy them young or even en primeur so that they can be brought to full maturity under his care. He will then have the satisfaction that these wines cost him a fraction of what he would have had to pay were he to buy the mature items on the current market. That is his profit! The priceless and supreme advantage is that his wine has been properly looked-after, and thus has been able to achieve its maximum potential. If by selling a part of his collection he is able to buy the wines he has been eyeing for some time, for example Romanee-Conti, but has not hitherto been able to afford, that is a huge plus from his wine hobby for him.\n\nThe wine investor (Group B) works on a totally different basis. He is cold-blooded about wines. They are just investment vehicles. He studies the market. He sees which wines appreciate the most and the least, which are red-hot wines everyone is looking for and hence command premium prices. He takes note of each country's stock markets, and economies, knowing full well that they will impinge on wine consumption and wine investments. There are companies which specialise in wine investments, who not only advise but also are able to secure allocations of the most sought-after en primeur releases, for example Romanee-Conti, Chateau Petrus, Lafite, Latour, etc for their clients as part of a fee for service system. They provide a full investment service, advising, assisting clients to procure wines for their wine portfolios in much the same way as other companies provide stock-market portfolio management for their clients.\n\nWith such wine investment services so readily available on a fee for service basis, does the wine investment client need to do any work himself? Can he leave it all in the hands of his wine investment adviser? Which is where this column comes in.\n\nI hold the view that an investor, whatever the vehicle he chooses to use, has the responsibility (to himself if to no one else) to learn as much as is within his grasp about what he is investing in. No doubt that the investment service he has engaged to advise and look after his investment has the duty to give him the best possible advice. Notwithstanding that this contractual undertaking exists, it would be sensible for the investor to learn and understand the nuts and bolts of his investments.\n\nNot only is there a need to know what the investment items are, in this case where wine is the vehicle of the investments, the issue of the quality of storage conditions of the wine is a matter of the greatest concern. In simple language, investor must be assured that his assets are properly stored, and in view of the fact that they are fine wines, certain optimum conditions apply.\n\nI guess I have something of a compulsive-obsessive nature. Whatever my stock of fine wines, I would want to know: (a) the full list of wines; (b) where they are stored; (c) the physical conditions under which they are stored - that is, (i) where is the store, (ii) are the bottles stored lying on their sides, in darkness except when it is necessary to inspect them; (iii) are they subject to vibrations, from example from proximity of the warehouse to a railway line; (iv) what is the ambient temperature of the store where the wines are; (v) what is the ambient humidity? I would expect my wines to be stored lying down in the dark (except on the occasions when it is necessary to inspect or identify them), in a vibration-free environment at 12 degrees centigrade, or better still at 10\u00b0 C; and at maximum of 70 per cent relative humidity.\n\nThe above are minimum services I would expect from a commercial wine investment service or consultant. The bottom line is this: If one does not take the trouble to understand what one should expect for a fee-for-service wine investment consultant one has to share responsibility for any mishaps or shortfalls that may befall your wine investment.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

One was saying that one (cargo) belongs to him, another trader said it belongs to him. They had the same document.\"\n\nStandard Chartered yesterday became the latest to say it was monitoring the situation at Qingdao.\n\nStandard Bank Group and a part-owned unit of Louis Dreyfus Corp, Singapore-listed GKE Corp, also warned on Wednesday of potential losses.\n\nA spokesman for Trafigura said this week that the trading house was following events at the port and gathering information.\n\nAnother major player, Glencore, which also uses the port, declined to comment earlier this week.\n\nCopper prices in London fell to their lowest in more than three weeks on Wednesday, partly due to worries over the probe, though prices steadied yesterday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Standard Bank said that it had started an investigation into potential irregularities at Qingdao port.\n\nThe bank, whose Standard Bank subsidiary conducts commodities trading, was responding to media enquiries relating to concerns over stocks of metal held in bonded warehouses at the port. \"Standard Bank Group is not yet in a position to quantify any potential loss arising from these circumstances,\" it said.\n\nThe bank said that it will work with the local authorities as part of its investigations.\n\nAuthorities at the port in north-east China have not officially confirmed an investigation, and have said that exports and operations are running normally.\n\nBut Xinhua news agency reported that the port had said that it was investigating whether iron ore warehouse receipts were fraudulently used multiple times to raise finance from different banks.\n\nTrading and warehousing sources also told Reuters some shipments of copper and aluminium into the port had been disrupted, relating to an investigation into the use of metal as collateral in financing.\n\nTraders estimated 80,000 tonnes of aluminium and 20,000-45,0000 tonnes of copper with a combined value of US$285-460 million could be affected by the investigation.\n\nAccording to traders and warehousing sources, port authorities at Qingdao's Dagang wharfs have been examining whether there had been multiple issuing of receipts for single cargoes of metal tied to a trading company and linked companies.\n\nLogistics provider GKE Corp warned shareholders on Wednesday that the investigation by port authorities might affect the business of a metals logistics unit in China.\n\n\"The company is currently assessing the potential impact of the investigation on the business,\" GKE said. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

But doing so is far from straightforward.\n\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said last week that results of a review of the CPF system will be shared in August, during a parliamentary debate which saw at least eight Members of Parliament rise to urge changes to the CPF. Online, debates over the CPF also persist.\n\nEven after setting aside tricky issues such as separating home ownership from the CPF - which would hit the property market, hiking employers' contribution rates further - which would add to high business costs, or forcing Singaporeans to save more, the demands for better CPF returns still require a sober assessment of risk-return trade-offs, pensions researchers and economists said.\n\nCPF savings are currently invested in risk-free Special Singapore Government Securities (SSGS) that are not traded and pay a coupon rate equal to the CPF interest rates, which are pegged to market rates of risk-free assets. As interest rates have remained low, the CPF interest rates sit at the legislated minimum of 2.5 per cent on Ordinary Account (OA) savings and 4 per cent on Special Account (SA) savings.\n\nObtaining higher returns would mean venturing beyond the safety of SSGS, with all the attendant implications.\n\n\"The decision to invest the public, specifically the average citizen's, money into riskier assets, is a contentious one. Fact is, implicit acceptance of downside by average citizens for a statutory board's investment decision cannot and should not be assumed. So the default position is that the government will have to hunt for higher yields, while standing ready to absorb (losses),\" said Mizuho Bank economist Vishnu Varathan.\n\nBenedict Koh, Singapore Management University finance professor and director of the Centre for Silver Security, thinks the government should not offer artificially high, guaranteed returns which it cannot consistently earn from the financial market. \"If they try to do so, they must take unusually high risk. If there are investment losses, they may need to balance the books by either raising taxes or draw down on reserves,\" he said.\n\nThere is also the issue of clarity - a formula pegged to riskier returns has to hedge against bad years, said Walter Theseira, who has served as a short-term consultant with the World Bank's Social Protection Team. Prof Theseira, also an assistant professor of economics at Nanyang Technological University, said: \"The current formula for all its issues is well understood. In some countries, pension benefits are set and reviewed by politicians regularly. But this means that the value of benefits can fluctuate depending on politics - so it doesn't guarantee retirees a more stable income than a system where benefits are determined by a market-based formula, as in Singapore.\"\n\nGoing into riskier assets will weaken that very guarantee. \"If you take on more risks, you can expect a higher return, but there is no guarantee of a higher return,\" said Joseph Cherian, director, Centre for Asset Management Research and Investments, NUS Business School.\n\nInstead, he proposes that the government issue inflation-indexed bonds, which CPF funds can then be invested in.\n\nThis idea seemed to have been shelved last July, when the Monetary Authority of Singapore said that it would not issue such bonds, which are based on expected inflation. Investors would be worse off than if they had bought a plain vanilla bond, should inflation fall under expectations, MAS said. It also deemed the premiums - estimated at 10 cents a dollar for a three-year bond, in the current low interest rate environment - to be too high for investors.\n\nProf Cherian thinks otherwise. \"There will come a time when the cost of bonds is cheaper.\" But he understands the government's reluctance. \"Much of Singapore's inflation is imported, so if they cannot fully control the cost of goods, to deliver the yield they would have to find resources through taxation and reserves.\"\n\nWith headline inflation in recent years skewed upwards by housing and car prices, he believes that a more accurate gauge of the average Singaporean's cost of living is the MAS core inflation rate. That was 1.7 per cent last year - both the OA and SA's floor rates of 2 and 4 per cent were higher.\n\nMr Varathan, who also thinks inflation-linked bonds are worth considering, pointed out that if interest rates pick up in the coming years, CPF rates can be expected to rise - just as the high 6.5 per cent CPF interest rate of the 1970s and early 1980s was driven by higher global interest rates.\n\nOne way to raise returns but have members bear their own risks could be to further liberalise the CPF Investment Scheme. But history does not bode well for CPF members taking their savings into their own hands. Of those who invested OA funds via the CPF Investment Scheme between 2004 and 2013, 47 per cent incurred losses and 35 per cent could not beat the guaranteed OA interest rate of 2.5 per cent. Only 18 per cent reaped gains of more than the OA rate.\n\nProf Koh suggested that CPF offer more \"default investment options\" - inflation-indexed bonds, life cycle funds or other passive, low-cost, diversified portfolios - to members who lack the financial knowledge to take risks with their savings.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch economist Chua Hak Bin's suggestion, also to reap economies of scale, is for CPF to offer members the option to invest directly into a GIC or Temasek-managed fund, leveraging on the two sovereign wealth funds' experience and capabilities. But he thinks that should be restricted to CPF members with savings above a certain threshold, which may not achieve the aim of raising returns for those most in need of retirement security.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Search efforts included an intensive underwater hunt with a mini-sub that could dive to 4,500 metres.\n\nBritish yachtswoman Katherine Tee added to speculation about the location of a possible crash site by revealing that she saw a glowing plane over the Indian Ocean in March.\n\nThe 41-year-old said she told Australian authorities of her sighting of a plane with \"what appeared to be a tail of black smoke coming from behind it\" while she travelled from Kochi in India to Phuket in Thailand.\n\n\"There were two other planes passing higher than it - moving the other way - at that time,\" she wrote on sailing site Cruisers Forum, a firm for which she also works.\n\n\"I recall thinking that if it was a plane on fire that I was seeing, the other aircraft would report it.\" She said she told no one at the time because she and her husband, who was onboard but asleep, had been having difficulties and had not spoken for about a week.\n\n\"And most of all, I wasn't sure of what I saw,\" she said. \"I couldn't believe it myself.\" But after confirming her yacht's position using GPS data in recent days, she said she knew she was in the \"right place at the right time\" and told the authorities.\n\nMH370's last known position, as tracked by military radar, was roughly west of Phuket, although the search area has focused on a zone hundreds of kilometres further south. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

By HELMI YUSOF\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Jun 5, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nKHVAY Samnang is one of Cambodia's most prominent artists who's frequently invited to show his works at international art events including the Singapore Biennale.\n\nBut like many Cambodian artists, he is cautious when talking about his art, for fear of government reprisals should his art be deemed anti-government.\n\nHis photo exhibition titled Human Nature at Tomio Koyama Gallery embodies that fear.\n\nFrom a distance, these photographs appear ordinary, with various people of different ages being shot in their own homes. Yet each one of these men, women and children wear a peculiar mask with minimal features, appearing almost alien in their home environments.\n\nSamnang explains: \"These people are afraid to speak up. They're afraid to express their worries of being resettled by the government. So the only way most of them would allow me to photograph them was if I let them wear a mask.\"\n\nSamnang made dozens of masks out of cloth and papier mache and let his subjects choose which ones they liked to wear, so that, \"at least, some aspect of their individuality comes through,\" he says.\n\nThe subjects of these photographs live in what's known as the White Building on the busy Sothearos Boulevard in Phnom Penh.\n\nIn 1963, the government housing project was erected and hailed for its \"Corbusier-inspired architecture\". The building sat close to a national theatre and public gardens, and provided social housing for artists, cultural workers and civil servants.\n\nWhen the brutal Khmer Rouge took over the country, much of these facilities were destroyed. About 90 per cent of artists were either killed or exiled. The remaining 10 per cent continue to live in the White Building, which has since fallen into grave disrepair.\n\nThe building - once the pride of the arts community - is now notorious for dangerous and unsavoury activities, even though it continues to house about 2,500 people.\n\nSamnang says: \"The artists and other residents of the building want to renovate or repair the exterior, but the government won't allow it. Meanwhile, private developers are trying to move people out with offers of compensation - but the money is too little to buy another place in the city.\"\n\nAccording to Samnang, the Human Nature series was conceived as a way to document these homes and inhabitants before the seemingly inevitable destruction. The masks the subjects wear, with their anodyne features, are grim symbols of their powerlessness against the march of development.\n\nSince the mid-2000s, Samnang has focused much of his practice on concerns over the impact of change and urbanisation on Cambodians.\n\nHis works, with their trenchant political messages, have caught the attention of many curators, critics and collectors.\n\nHis five-channel video work at the Singapore Biennale, for instance, was lauded by the local press. It showed him standing at five different locations and pouring one bucket of sand after another on himself.\n\nHe made the work as a statement against the way his government allowed various lakes to be filled with sand so that the area could be sold to developers. Meanwhile, thousands of families who rely on the lakes for their daily water needs suffer the consequences.\n\nSamnang adds: \"I make art for people who are affected by these changes but don't know how to speak up, or don't think they have the right to speak up. I want to show the world what they need, and what they've lost.\"\n\nhelmi@sph.com.sg\n\n@HelmiBT\n\n'Khvay Samnang: Human Nature' is showing at Tomio Koyama Gallery at 47, Malan Road, Gillman Barracks, from now till July 13.

The shipment is illegal, SOMO, Iraq's oil marketing company, said on Tuesday.\n\nThe tanker \"has arrived at its destination\", Kurdish news website Rudaw reported late on Tuesday, citing Safeen Dizayee, a spokesman for the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). Rudaw didn't specify the destination.\n\n\"There will be a lot of attention focused on where that tanker heads because it is potentially a milestone, the first cargo,\" Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects Ltd in London, said by phone.\n\n\"That would discourage any potential buyers. It may also limit the Kurds' options, it may force them to accept discounts on the price that they can sell for,\" Mr Mallinson added.\n\nThree calls to the Kurdish Regional Government's natural resources ministry weren't answered and an e-mail wasn't returned.\n\nUnited Leadership is owned by Marine Management Services MC, according to a database IHS maintains for the United Nations' shipping agency. Four calls to the company's offices in Piraeus, Greece, on Tuesday weren't returned and the line went dead when Bloomberg News asked for an e-mail address for Marine Management's directors. A message to the company's generic e-mail address wasn't immediately returned.\n\nThe KRG estimates its region has about 45 billion barrels of crude reserves. Iraq itself has about 150 billion barrels. A dispute between the two sides escalated last month when the Kurds began pumping oil through their own pipeline to Ceyhan, the Turkish port in the Mediterranean sea from where ship tracking data show United Leadership loaded its cargo.\n\nIraq said on May 23 it sought arbitration over Kurdish oil sales at the International Chamber of Commerce.\n\nSOMO said on June 1 that buyers should not purchase the cargo.

This was the first time since 2002 that the basic wage increase for the rank-and-file exceeded that of the non rank-and-file at 4.7 per cent.\n\nDBS economist Irvin Seah said that the salary growth was in line with his expectations. \"In terms of real wage growth, it is quite a significant improvement as inflation was actually higher in 2012. This reflects an improvement in productivity and a tighter labour market,\" he said.\n\nToby Fowlston, managing director of Robert Walters Singapore, said: \"There has been an increased focus on hiring local talent, resulting in greater competition for this limited talent pool, especially in certain sectors with high demand. This drives wages up, but not for every industry.\"\n\nThe MOM report also revealed that there has been a general uptrend in the implementation of flexible wage measures. In December 2013, 86 per cent of private sector employees worked in establishments which had at least one of the flexible wage components recommended by the tripartite partners - employers, workers and government.\n\nHaving a narrow maximum-minimum salary ratio was the most common wage recommendation adopted at 63 per cent. This was followed by linking variable bonus to Key Performance Indicators (51 per cent) and having the Monthly Variable Component (34 per cent) in the wage structure.\n\nBonuses did not go up as much as basic wages in 2013 as the annual variable component in the private sector averaged 2.21 months of basic wage in 2013, up by 0.9 per cent from the 2.19 months in 2012. Consequently, the annual variable component formed a slightly higher share of total wages at 15.6 per cent in 2013, than the 15.4 per cent in 2012.\n\nCham Hui Fong, assistant secretary-general, National Trades Union Congress, said that the labour movement will continue to push for the Progressive Wage Model to be pervasive in all sectors.\n\n\"This will not only raise productivity and upgrade skills, our workers can also look forward to better wages and better career progression. We also call on employers to tap on the various funding schemes and programmes, so as to achieve higher productivity growth,\" she added.\n\nEconomists like Selena Ling, head, treasury research and strategy at OCBC Bank, added that the wage growth is expected to continue.\n\n\"The economic and business cycle is picking up globally, albeit at a choppy pace, and it is not unexpected that more firms are turning the corner. Real wage growth should be sustained this year, especially since inflation is subsiding. It will be very encouraging if the wage share increases over time as well,\" she said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By HELMI YUSOF\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Jun 5, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE OPEN, a pre-event of the Singapore International Festival of Arts, starts this month and boasts an eclectic film programme of 19 films that range from the excellent to the eye-opening to the downright weird.\n\nFor a standard ticket of $45, you can watch any or all of these films, though you have to register for each title on theopen.sifa.sg because of the theatre's limited seating capacity.\n\nBesides the films, you can also catch dozens of performances, talks and exhibitions.\n\nBut if time is scarce, BT picks out five of the best:\n\nWEB JUNKIE\n\n74min/Israel-USA/In Mandarin with subtitles\n\nOne teen played the Warcraft series of computer games for 300 hours, with occasional naps. Another stayed glued to his computer screen for two months. In the crazy world of computer addicts, however, sleep is not the only thing that's sacrificed. School work, diet and exercise, and, most importantly, relationships with friends and family are completely neglected. Being connected online means near-complete disconnection from reality.\n\nFilmmakers Shosh Shlam and Hilla Medalia were interested in the phenomenon of Internet addiction and took their cameras to China where the problem is on the rise. They spent four months inside Internet detox facilities where dozens of young men and women were being treated. Many were forcibly cut off from the Internet and made to spend time with their families and other youngsters instead.\n\nWeb Junkie suggests, however, that computer addiction goes beyond the attraction of games and the Web, and that, perhaps, poor family dynamics and China's one-child policy lie at the heart of the problem.\n\nWADJDA\n\n100min/Saudi Arabia/In Arabic with English subtitles\n\nQuite likely to be an audience favourite, Wadjda tells a simple but touching story of the titular girl who dreams of owning a bicycle. But she lives in Saudi Arabia, where girls are discouraged from riding bicycles just as women are not allowed to drive.\n\nWadjda tries to break away from the constraints placed on girls, even as she watches her mother struggle in vain against the misogyny of their society. When she realises the only way she can buy a bicycle for herself is if she wins the prize money of a Koran-reading competition, Wadjda buckles down for the fight of her young life.\n\nDirected by Haifaa al-Mansour, the country's first and only female feature director, Wadjda won rave reviews when it premiered at the Venice Film Festival. It went on to earn numerous awards on the international festival circuit.\n\nIronically, it is the first film to be selected by Saudi Arabia to compete for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar - even though director al-Mansour had to sometimes direct the film from a distance through a walkie-talkie because she could not be seen in public working with her male crew members.\n\nHOLY MOTORS\n\n115min/France/In French with English subtitles\n\nThis may be the strangest, most surreal, most indecipherable film you'll see this year. But it will likely appeal to hardcore cinephiles because of the astonishing way it overturns many cinematic conventions to create something quite original, lyrical and cosmic.\n\nDennis Lavant plays a man who appears ordinary as he bids goodbye to his kids and leaves for work. But when he steps into his chauffeur-driven limo, he puts on a costume and prosthetics. And when he steps out of the limo, he becomes an entirely different character.\n\nFrom here on, the film veers wildly from being a drama to a sci-fi fantasy to a gangster flick to a musical to a drama again. Is this a study of the actor's craft, a loving tribute to cinematic genres, or a spiritual allegory of reincarnation and past lives?\n\nIt's hard to say because the film is in parts comic, in parts tragic, and in parts dull.\n\nIts director Leo Carax was once the darling of avant garde cinema with films like Mauvais Sang (1986) and Lovers On The Bridge (1991), both starring Juliette Binoche. But he stopped making feature films in 1999 - returning only in 2012 with Holy Motors to received cheers and jeers at its Cannes premiere.\n\nFor fans of his iconoclastic style of filmmaking, however, Holy Motors is worth the wait.\n\nVERONIQUE DOISNEAU\n\n37min/France/In French with English subtitles\n\nA must-watch for dance fans, Veronique Doisneau is a 37-minute documentary about ballet dancer Veronique Doisneau, who is 42, married with kids, and about to retire from the world of dancing.\n\nStanding on a bare stage of the Paris Opera, she delivers one last performance which details the physical and emotional sacrifices she has made in her career as a dancer.\n\nBlending a monologue with live dancing, she talks about her love of Balanchine and Petipa, and her work with Nureyev and Cunningham.\n\nShe also demonstrates moves from different dances, showing how ballet makes excruciating demands on the body and ultimately extracts a high toll.\n\nUnderstated and poignant, the documentary is directed by choreographer Jerome Bel, who is presenting Disabled Theatre in September at the Singapore International Festival of Arts. The work will features dancers with mental disabilities and is one of the highlights of the festival.\n\nWHAT NOW? REMIND ME\n\n164min/Portugal/In Portuguese with English subtitles\n\nA film that's not for everyone, this emotionally-draining, almost three-hour-long documentary is a film diary of Joaquim Pinto.\n\nPinto is a well-known sound mixer who once worked with important Portuguese directors such as Raul Ruiz and Joao Cesar Monteiro.\n\nStruck with Hepatitis C and HIV, he takes a road trip from his home in Portugal to a clinic in Spain for a drug trial. Along the way, he shoots himself musing about mortality, and splices these monologues with images of people he loves as well as his long career in film.\n\nThe result is a work that's brave and intimate, but also hard to watch.\n\nhelmi@sph.com.sg\n\n@HelmiBT\n\n'The OPEN' runs from June 26 to July 12. The films are shown at various times during the period. Check out theopen.sifa.sg for more details.

This compares with four IPOs in May last year, which raised $1.8 billion.\n\nSecurities activities have been lacklustre for a few quarters, after the collapse of penny stocks in October last year and an investigation into the event weighed on sentiment.\n\nTrading volume for derivatives, which has been the main engine of growth for the exchange in recent quarters, fell 26 per cent from a year ago to 8.1 million contracts. It slipped 4 per cent month on month.\n\nTotal open interest as at end-May was down 5 per cent from a year earlier, at 3.5 million contracts. Derivatives volume had fallen 13 per cent year on year and 10 per cent month on month in April to 8.5 million contracts.\n\nThe most active contract in May was China A50 futures, where two million contracts were traded, up 23 per cent from May last year. Nikkei 225 Index futures, however, were a drag on trading volume, falling 68 per cent over the year to 1.5 million contracts.\n\nIn commodities, the volume of iron ore swaps, futures and options that SGX cleared more than quadrupled to a record 214,534 contracts. Open interest also hit a monthly record of 166,657 contracts at the end of last month.\n\nBut the volume for rubber futures was down 4 per cent year on year at 33,215 contracts.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Yesterday's number of bids for Cat A was about 200 more than during the previous tender; in Cat B, it was about 100 higher.\n\n\"The sentiment is good but premiums are relatively low because the bookings were collected at lower prices in order to entice customers to sign on the dotted line,\" he said. \"With thinner margins, distributors cannot bid up COE prices.\"\n\nOne distributor, referring to the surge in premium for Cat C, said he expected the spike to be a passing one, as most dealers' stocks have arrived and are being prepared for delivery.\n\nThe dealers were initially understocked because of the success of the Early Turnover Scheme (ETS), he said, referring to the programme encouraging early replacement of old Cat C diesel vehicles with models that comply with at least Euro V diesel standards or their equivalent.\n\n\"But once the Cat C premium goes up too much, most buyers will switch back to ETS and the pressure should be off again.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Japanese developers are boosting investments in the lead up to the Tokyo Olympics in six years' time, as vacancy rates decline and rents climb, and as they bet on a strategic zoning plan announced in March as part of the government's plan to stimulate economic growth.\n\nMori's announcement follows the biggest share sale plan in 32 years by Mitsui Fudosan, the nation's biggest publicly traded developer, last week. \"Toranomon area has great potential,\" said Mr Tsuji. \"We would like to speed up the revitalisation of the area.\"\n\nThe government has designated strategic zones, including the region around Tokyo, that will offer lower corporate taxes and looser building restrictions to lure investment, according to a proposal announced on March 28.\n\nThe 52-storey Toranomon Hills, which will open next Wednesday, is Mori's biggest project since the developer's US$2.2 billion Roppongi Hills in downtown Tokyo in 2003. The building in Toranomon consists of office, residential and retail space over 244,360 square metres, according to Mori.\n\nThe 247-metre tower, near the US embassy compound and government buildings, including the Congress, will be the tallest after Mitsui Fudosan's Tokyo Midtown, according to Mori.\n\nThe new building's completion coincides with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's efforts to revive the world's third-largest economy.\n\nThe occupancy at Toranomon Hills is \"almost completely full\", Mr Tsuji said. Tenants of the skyscraper, whose floors are in a quadrilateral shape, include Andaz Hotel under Hyatt Hotels; Asatsu-DK, Japan's third-largest advertising company, and Nishimatsu Construction, according to Mori Building.\n\nTokyo's office vacancy rate fell to 6.6 per cent in April from 8.5 per cent a year earlier and is at the lowest since March 2009, according to Miki Shoji, a closely held office brokerage company.\n\nAverage office rents gained for the fourth straight month in April, the longest run of increases since the period to June 2008, it said.\n\nToranomon, which means tiger's gate in Japanese, was named after an old gate that once guarded the neighbourhood, housing samurai houses during the Edo period from 1603 to 1867, according to Mori Building's website. The area is now vying with the city's main business districts of Otemachi and Marunouchi. Before World War II, the streets were filled with restaurants where geishas played shamisen, a three-string musical instrument, and sang to their clients, Mori Building said on its website, citing Masafumi Aoki, a resident who has lived in the area since the 1930s.\n\nThe new complex looms over Loop Road No 2 that connects central Tokyo to the bay area where one of the two competition zones will be located for the 2020 Olympic Games.\n\nAbeno Harukas in Osaka is Japan's tallest building at 300 metres, according to the Chicago-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

After her operatic debut as Mercedes in Singapore Lyric Opera's Carmen, Nagatome is back with the second instalment of her recital series May Breezes.\n\nSatsuki means May or Mayflower in Japanese. \"It is the season to experience refreshing breezes and clear blue skies,\" she says, promising a performance that will illustrate the season.\n\nThe performance will feature familiar favourites like the arias from Faust and Madame Butterfly, which she believes will allow even new opera lovers to enjoy the performance.\n\nThe Tokyo-born Nagatome began performing as a member of NHK Tokyo Broadcasting Children's Chorus at the age of seven, after which she appeared on several television and radio shows as well as stage performances.\n\nThese include two concert tours in Austria, Germany and Russia, where she performed at the Tchaikovsky hall at the age of 13.\n\nSince moving to Singapore around 10 years ago, she has performed with the SLO as well as at the Shaw Foundation Symphony Stage in 2011 with renowned pianist Julian Lawrence Gargiulo.\n\nIn 2008, she started Bel Canto, conducting voice lessons for international students and forming Japanese children's choruses in Singapore. Nagatome cites Italian opera singer Barbara Frittoli as her inspiration, and adds that her love for singing, acting and dancing led her to believe that opera was perfect for her.\n\n\"Opera singing techniques are very different from other music. I use my whole body and sweat a lot during the performances. I lose weight after each production,\" Nagatome laughs, calling it her \"opera diet\".\n\nShe adds that the entire production is funded out of her own pocket, admitting that she wasn't sure how to find a sponsor. She is, however, confident that her production will be a success, saying it will be a refreshing take on classic opera acts.\n\nThe recital will include several arias and opera scenes, performed by Nagatome and her Bel Canto students, accompanied by pianist Vincent Chen, guest singer Brent Allcock and guest dancers Daphne Huang Vargas and Toshi Konno.\n\nOther pieces include Tacea la Notte Placida from Verdi's Il Travator and Belle Nuit (The Tales of Hoffman) by Offenbach, which will be performed by Nagatome's Bel Canto students.\n\n'May Breezes: Volume 2 - My Favourite Operas' will be held on June 11 at the Esplanade Recital Studio, at 7.30 pm.

This may result in tighter liquidity conditions for the region's bond markets in the coming months.\n\nAmong the risks the ADB sees as clouding the outlook for East Asia are a potential slowdown in China's economy, market turmoil generated by Federal Reserve tapering and uncertainty over the timing of its policy rate hike.\n\nAn added risk now is that volatile capital flows might arise if the European Central Bank (ECB) addresses the potential threat of deflation in the eurozone, the ADB said.\n\nThe outstanding size of the emerging East Asian local currency bond market reached US$7.6 trillion at the end of March, up 2.1 per cent quarter on quarter and up 9.5 per cent year on year, the ADB reported.\n\nChina accounted for about two-thirds of the quarterly growth of the market in the first quarter of this year. Its local currency bond market \"remained the region's largest, with an outstanding size of US$4.7 trillion at the end of March - equivalent to 61.5 per cent of the total emerging East Asian local currency bond market.\n\n\"Meanwhile, Vietnam was the fastest-growing local currency bond market in emerging East Asia in (the first quarter),\" growing 23 per cent over the previous quarter.\n\nThe total size of the local currency government bond market in emerging East Asia expanded by 2.2 per cent in the first quarter of this year, compared to the final quarter of 2013, to reach US$4.6 trillion, the ADB noted.\n\nDeutsche Bank noted in a report earlier this year that the corporate bond market grew by 1.9 per cent to US$3.1 trillion, and that such markets in Asia have expanded rapidly.\n\nSince the global financial crisis, Asian corporates have made increasing use of bond issuance for their funding needs, complementing traditional channels such as bank lending, Deutsche Bank noted.\n\n\"The boom in bond issuance, which grew more than four-fold since 2008, has been fuelled by favourable global liquidity conditions and regional initiatives.\"\n\nMeanwhile, foreign investor interest in Indonesian government bonds has continued to rise, said the ADB report yesterday. The share of foreign holdings climbed to 33.6 per cent at the end of March from 32.5 per cent at the end of last December on \"positive market sentiments amid improving macroeconomic fundamentals\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Now, a Hong Kong-based tech start-up is trying to do the same with the goods vehicle market here.\n\nCalled GoGoVan, the app connects commercial vehicle drivers with customers, enabling logistic solutions, especially for last mile delivery services.\n\n\"GoGoVan is an app that helps you book a professional driver - it can be a van or motorcycle or lorry - at any time of the day, instantly,\" the app's co-founder Steven Lam told The Business Times.\n\nSince its launch in Hong Kong in July last year, the app has replaced traditional call centres there, with more than 16,000 drivers registered on it and more than 600,000 transactions logged.\n\n\"We are literally the largest fleet (of commercial vehicles) in Hong Kong already,\" Mr Lam said.\n\nSingapore is the company's first foray overseas, after GoGoVan had its soft launch here last Sunday. More than 1,000 drivers have shown interest in the app, with over 300 already registered and verified.\n\nSaid Mr Lam: \"I'd say it's realistic for us to get at least 30,000 (drivers) in the first 6-10 months, using the same growth (patterns seen in) Hong Kong.\"\n\nGoGoVan, which works based on location, first alerts the closest drivers to a request. The drivers can then choose to respond to it.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the company guarantees that someone will respond to a request in 10-15 seconds. \"That's the whole business model . . . and how we solve problems with technology,\" Mr Lam said, adding that as the app is still new to Singapore, the company is not able to guarantee that response time yet.\n\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises are expected to form the bulk of its users, similar to Hong Kong, where SME customers make up 50-60 per cent of the business. Individuals looking to transport bulky items are the company's other target group.\n\n\"In Hong Kong and Singapore, vehicle ownership is not very high, and the cost of keeping it is also very high, so for a lot of passenger vehicle owners, when they need to move something, they are not going to use their own vehicle, but ask for help,\" Mr Lam said.\n\nOn the driver side of the app, individuals or smaller companies who own goods vehicles and have idle capacity are the ideal users, he added. \"As long as they have the right (to use the vehicle) and the time to utilise their idle capacity, then we can solve their problem and (help them) make more money.\"\n\nPrices for each journey are set by GoGoVan, based on a formula that takes into account factors such as distance, location and vehicle type.\n\nFor example, a basic motorcycle delivery within the city area would cost around $8, while a trip in a 26-foot lorry from Jurong to Changi would start from $40.\n\nPayment will be made directly to the driver, who purchases credits to use the application. The service is free for now, though Mr Lam said that the company could charge around 10 per cent in commission in the future.\n\nFor quality control, customers can rate a driver's service after each trip.\n\nGoGoVan recently completed a fund-raising round, raising a seven-figure US dollar sum.

The shares were to start trading yesterday, listed on the Mexico Stock Exchange. With manufacturing and logistics space for rent across the country, Prologis Property is positioning itself to benefit from rising demand after President Enrique Pena Nieto overhauled the constitution last year to lure investment.\n\nTo complete the offering, the Reit braved a market that hasn't had an IPO since the US Federal Reserve began reducing a record stimulus programme.

It received $160 million orders with private bank customers accounting for 87 per cent of the deal.\n\nAspial, a jewellery and property company, in January sold three-year $80 million bonds which paid 4.5 per cent.\n\nLast week, Ezion Holdings, a gas and oil service provider, was able to sell a seven-year bond paying 4.875 per cent. Its $150 million issue received orders reaching $500 million, with 76 per cent going to private bank clients.\n\nThe company sweetened the deal by making it non-call 4 which means it can only redeem the bonds in the fourth year; the first call date is June 11, 2018. If it does not redeem the bonds, there is a 2 per cent step-up margin which means the company has to pay an extra 2 per cent.\n\nIn April, Ezion sold $55 million six-year bonds paying 5.10 per cent. Last August it sold five-year $60 million bonds at 4.60 per cent.\n\nInvestors with longer memories may recall that Ezion had to pull a $75 million perpetual bond deal in January 2013 after a sell-off in the market despite offering an indicated princely 8 per cent coupon.\n\nAnother frequent issuer last week was Swiber Holdings - also in the oil and gas sector. Its two-year $130 million issue paying 5.125 per cent had $600 million orders, again with private banks accounting for an overwhelming 86 per cent.\n\nAlso doing well and making investors salivate was developer Heeton Holdings' three-year $60 million sale as it paid out 5.9 per cent.\n\nStrong demand for bonds is likely to remain for a while yet as interest rates show little sign of rising while supply continues to be low.\n\nYear to date, there were 56 Singapore dollar denominated issues worth $10.8 billion, according to ThomsonReuters. For the same period last year, it was 112 deals amounting to $17.7 billion.\n\nSaid Tshua Ngee, Bank of Singapore executive director, fixed income research: \"Since the beginning of this year, 10-year US Treasuries have fallen sharply from north of 3 per cent to currently closer to 2.4 per cent.\n\n\"The concern of an imminent rate hike, particularly led by the US, has apparently taken a back seat for now. Hence, there has been a considerable shift in the mindset of investors who are therefore willing to invest more into fixed income securities, taking on more credit risks in their continued demand and hunt for yield,\" he said.\n\n\"From a fundamental perspective, we noted that the quality of issuers has shown a mixed bag in divergence, with a wider spectrum in credit profiling,\" said Mr Ngee.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore Financial Stability Review 2013 mentioned that the number of investment-grade bond issues fell sharply in 2013 and accounted for only 26 per cent of the total value of bonds issued in the period (up to October 2013), down from 50 per cent in 2012.\n\n\"The rest of the issues were largely made up by unrated credits. Apparently, this trend has continued into 2014,\" he said.\n\n\"We believe investors should not lose focus on credit quality and need to be cautious towards highly leveraged companies where the debt servicing and refinancing ability of companies could be affected in future, especially as interest rates rise,\" said Neel Gopalakrishnan, Credit Suisse, private banking and wealth management, emerging markets bond analyst.\n\nAdded Mr Ngee: \"Given the limited bond supply relative to the continued liquidity demand in the market, particularly within the private bank segment, most of the recent bond issues are priced on the tight side, in our view.\" This means investors may not be compensated adequately for the risks taken, he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It has entered into a process agreement with Australand for an exclusive period of four weeks to conduct due diligence before finalising an implementation agreement that is binding.\n\n\"The proposal will catapult FCL to become one of Australia's leading real estate companies with a portfolio of scale and quality,\" said FCL group chief executive Lim Ee Seng, who was in Australia when the announcement was released yesterday.\n\nThe proposed deal is touted as \"transformational\" as it will result in a substantial increase in group assets and earnings. It would grant FCL access to Australand's A$2.4 billion of office and industrial properties and A$9.3 billion of developments pipeline in Australia, one of FCL's core markets since its entry over a decade ago.\n\nUnderpinned by strong momentum in its residential division, Australand is expecting its earnings per security this year to grow by 20-25 per cent from 2013 based on a further review of its operating earnings outlook.\n\nShould the proposal become a binding offer, Australand's board intends to recommend the proposal \"in the absence of a superior proposal and subject to an independent expert opinion\", Australand said yesterday.\n\nUnder FCL's proposal, Australand security holders would be entitled to an expected first-half 2014 distribution of 12.75 cents per stapled security and an additional distribution of up to 12.75 cents apiece for second-half 2014 until the offer becomes unconditional.\n\nAustraland has been seen as a takeover target since CapitaLand said it wanted to sell its 59.1 per cent stake early last year after a strategic review. The stake was fully divested in two tranches of private placements - at A$3.685 apiece in November and at an average A$3.75 apiece in March this year.\n\nA CapitaLand spokeswoman said the company was not at liberty to disclose the identities of interested parties whom the group held discussions with.\n\nBT understands that apart from a takeover offer or an acquisition approved by resolution of a target company, the stake that can be acquired in the target company cannot exceed 19.9 per cent under Australian takeover rules. FCL would also not have access to Australand's books for due diligence if it was acquiring shares from then-shareholder CapitaLand.\n\nStockland, which snapped up a 19.9 per cent stake in AustraLand in March, tabled an offer at A$4.20 for each stapled security the following month. But it was prompted to raise its final offer price to A$4.35 apiece when the original bid was rejected by Australand.\n\nStockland said separately yesterday that its board will consider its options and provide an update in due course.\n\nIn the event that FCL's offer becomes binding, Australand could be delisted from the Australian stock exchange if the latter manages to obtain 100 per cent interest in Australand.\n\nFCL, which was spun off as a listing by conglomerate Fraser and Neave in January, now hopes to raise the contribution from overseas properties and increase the proportion of recurring income to about half of group income over the medium term. Its latest proposal, if implemented, is expected to help the group to achieve these objectives in a shorter time.\n\n\"We already have an established platform and good brand recognition in Australia, but real estate is a business where scale and depth matter,\" said Mr Lim. \"This proposal will be the catalyst that will help FCL to deepen our roots and accelerate our growth in a market that we believe will continue to offer long-term growth prospects.\"\n\nThe proposed offer price represents a premium of 4 per cent over the last closing price of Australand's stapled securities of A$4.31 each as at June 3 and a 22 per cent premium to Australand's estimated net tangible assets per security of A$3.68 as at June 30.\n\nDeutsche Bank AG and Standard Chartered Bank are the financial advisers to FCL.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

While there have been media reports of late saying that the bilateral project has yet to draw in people and businesses, Mr Ho pointed out that the project has made good progress from three years ago when there were no residents.\n\nNow, there are around 10,000 homes being sold, more than 10,000 residents and over 1,000 registered companies in the eco-city. A theme park is slated to open this year and a hospital next year. A Hilton Hotel is scheduled to open in Tianjin eco-city soon.\n\nAddressing the issue of \"ghost towns\" in China where homes are built but no one is living in them, Mr Ho stressed that the progress at the Tianjin eco-city project \"cannot be rushed\".\n\nLike the preceding bilateral project Suzhou Industrial Park, the Tianjin project has the support of both governments at the highest level.\n\nIn the Tianjin project, the salt-alkaline land site with limited water supply was chosen to demonstrate how eco-solutions can be adopted and applied elsewhere. This eco-city project needs to fulfil a set of qualitative and quantitative key performance indicators.\n\n\"There are challenges but they can be overcome,\" Mr Ho said. As China continues to urbanise, there will be the difficulty of bringing people to greenfield places, he added.\n\nMr Lim of CapitaLand also noted that developers play a major role in contributing to \"better cities in China\" through environmentally friendly projects and buildings that are more accessible to a larger population that includes seniors.\n\nHe said, however, that there are too many new CBDs and an oversupply of commercial properties in China due to centralised economic targets and an inadequate funding model that drives local government to raise revenue from selling land use rights.\n\n\"But we are heartened that the reform of local government funding model is under way and the urbanisation focus will be on small to mid-sized cities, instead of mega-cities,\" Mr Lim said, adding that he is confident China can unleash the potential from high-quality urbanisation.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Satire programme Heute Show on national public broadcaster ZDF has practically dedicated a segment to the spiralling fiasco.\n\nIn one sketch, a pseudo-serious news reader suggested renaming the facility \"Tebartz van Elst Airport\" after Germany's \"bling bishop\" who was forced to resign in March over enormous cost overruns for the renovation of his official residence.\n\nAnother joke has become a top-selling postcard featuring a picture of former East German leader Walter Ulbricht and his notorious pledge a few months before the Berlin Wall went up in 1961: \"No one has any intention of building a wall\". But \"wall\" has been replaced by \"airport\".\n\nBeyond the bitter gags, Germany has been horrified to see its global reputation for efficiency and engineering prowess tarnished and one of its biggest building sites become a laughing stock.\n\n\"German engineers are still highly respected but the rest of the world has taken note of the disaster at Berlin airport - in China people talk to you about BER,\" said Peter Englisch of business services giant EY, formerly Ernst & Young, during a recent presentation on Germany's attractiveness as a place to do business.\n\n\"We have made major progress,\" insisted BER's spokesman Ralf Kunkel.\n\nMr Kunkel answers to Hartmut Mehdorn, the former head of German rail company Deutsche Bahn and airline Air Berlin, who has been enlisted to turn things around.\n\nThe first goal is not even to set an opening date but simply to say when a date might be fixed.\n\n\"By the end of the year,\" promises Mr Kunkel. \"We want to avoid giving a false deadline once again, we've done that enough in the past.\"\n\nThe main problem remains the fire safety system.\n\n\"The rules in this area have been reinforced in recent years in Germany, particularly after the fire at Duesseldorf airport,\" Mr Kunkel said, referring to a catastrophe in western Germany in 1996 in which 17 people died.\n\n\"Since then, it's become a complex issue that, obviously, was underestimated,\" he told AFP.\n\nA progress report in late April found major faults with BER's smoke extraction system - a problem at the core of the Duesseldorf disaster.\n\nThe plan is now to break the system into three parts to make it more manageable and efficient.\n\nBut work has not even begun and impatience is growing. Some officials, seemingly at the end of their tether, have put forward the radical idea of razing the existing building and starting from scratch.\n\nEach month, the site financed by the federal government, the city-state of Berlin and the Brandenburg region costs taxpayers 17 million euros (S$29.1 million) in maintenance fees.\n\nThat comes on top of a budget now estimated to have reached five billion euros, about three times more than the 1.7 billion euros originally earmarked.\n\nAnd that figure only covers the building itself, not the vast indirect costs linked to it.\n\nA \"ghost train\", for example, connecting the city with the airport terminal must run once a day - without passengers - to prevent the rails from rusting and the tunnel walls from gathering mould.

It also takes into account differences and exceptions, including distances to the MRT and real-time rentals of other units in the same project.\n\nSam Baker, co-founder and chief executive officer of SRX, pointed out that tenants will be able to establish \"fair market values for rents\", while landlords will be able to evaluate rental yield with greater accuracy.\n\n\"Accountants and government authorities will have a more transparent basis in which to assess rental income,\" said Mr Baker.\n\nHe added that public policymakers will also gain insight into the dynamics of the rental market here and how they impact housing.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The authority, which also owns the World Trade Center site where the twin towers stood, spends more to police its assets than to maintain them.\n\nA panel formed by governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and Andrew Cuomo of New York is poised to review security costs as part of a re-examination of the agency. Spending on police is draining the budget for capital improvements, such as a replacement for the decaying 64-year-old bus terminal near Times Square, which serves 230,000 commuters daily.\n\n\"We really need to have a top-to-bottom analysis of all the security that we have and see why it's growing at such a disproportionate rate,\" said Kenneth Lipper, one of nine Port Authority commissioners.\n\nThe review may include potential mergers with local and state police agencies, according to a source.\n\nSpending on police is projected at US$652 million this year, up from US$279 million in 2001, according to the authority. The budget includes US$115 million for private security, mostly at the three major airports and the World Trade Center, a 16-acre site that's being transformed into a museum, memorial and commercial district.\n\nCapital spending on security - money allocated to new projects and equipment - has increased to US$282 million this year from US$8 million in 2001.\n\nFounded in 1921, the Port Authority funds itself through tolls, fares, rent, surcharges on airline tickets, parking and other fees.

At some point, it may impact trade and our real economies.\"\n\nMr Ng was speaking after a weekend forum of defence ministers and military leaders in Singapore, where the US and China openly criticised each other over their agenda in the region and China's claims over large parts of the East China Sea and South China Sea dominated discussion. The meeting highlighted the growing pains in Asia as China emerges as a military and economic power, challenging decades of US dominance.\n\n\"China's rise is a fact,\" Dr Ng said. \"China needs to articulate its own vision, and its own position in this new, revised world order. Our approach has been that dialogue is essential, inclusivity is important.\"\n\nUS Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel used a May 31 speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore to say that China has, in recent months, \"undertaken destabilising, unilateral actions asserting its claims in the South China Sea\", while Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that Japan did not welcome dangerous encounters by jets or warships. Wang Guanzhong, the deputy chief of general staff of the People's Liberation Army, broke from his prepared remarks to the forum to call their speeches \"unimaginable\".\n\nNorman Boersma, Bahamas-based chief investment officer of Templeton Global Equity Group, which manages US$130 billion in assets, said in an interview in Singapore: \"If China and Japan got into a war, that would be a real problem. These are two big economies and they would have a fundamental impact.\"\n\nThe US comments follow Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung's appeal for a \"stronger voice\" from the US against China after clashes between coast guard and fishing vessels near an oil rig China placed in contested waters off Vietnam's coast. The Philippines, dwarfed militarily by China, has sought support from the US and the United Nations against China's encroachment into shoals off its coast.\n\nDr Ng, a medical doctor who previously held the education and manpower portfolios, said that given the current tensions, the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact and other multinational deals are \"quite strategic, not just good to have but a must to have\".\n\nThe US-led 12-nation TPP, which would cover an area with about US$28 trillion in annual economic output, doesn't include China.\n\n\"You certainly don't want a scenario where your frameworks are weighted towards security,\" Dr Ng said. \"From Singapore's point of view, we would not be upset if, for example, there were no big issues to discuss at the Shangri-La Dialogue. That's not a bad outcome for us.\"\n\nUnder President Xi Jinping, China has taken a more assertive approach to territory. It claims much of the South China Sea under its \"nine-dash line\" map, first published in 1947.\n\nThe map extends hundreds of miles south from China's Hainan Island to equatorial waters off the coast of Borneo, taking in some of the world's busiest shipping lanes. Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines also claim parts of the sea, while Singapore is not a claimant.\n\nThe 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations on May 12 called for self-restraint on the territorial disputes. The statement did not mention China by name and Asean does not take a position on the actual claims. China is Asean's biggest trading partner.\n\nAsean is seeking a code of conduct for the waters, although talks have made little progress since China agreed in July to start discussions and China introducing fishing rules in January requiring foreign vessels to seek permission before entering waters off its southern coast.\n\n\"To those accusations that we haven't moved resolutely or quick enough on the code of conduct, Asean and China should say agreed, mea culpa,\" Dr Ng said. \"There has been progress. Our foreign colleagues will have to work quicker, sharper and smarter to have tangible outcomes.\"\n\nTackling some aspects individually may be best, given the difficulty of addressing sovereignty, he said. \"It's easier to break it down into smaller pieces and not expect some magic contrivance that suddenly removes all disputes and removes all historical baggage. That's just completely unrealistic.\"\n\nSingapore urges Thailand to move quickly towards elections, Dr Ng said. The country's military leaders seized power on May 22 after six months of debilitating anti-government street protests, the 12th coup in eight decades.\n\n\"We are concerned - all countries are - that the longer the period of military rule, the farther any country deviates from civilian rule and democratically elected governments, and greater the risk for autocracy and the abuses that can come.\"\n\nThe US and Australia have suspended military cooperation with Thailand. Singapore carries out training in Thailand, \"which they have kindly said we can continue and our troops are still safe there\", Dr Ng said. \"Things are so fluid that articulations of deeply held positions may not be productive at this time.\"\n\nSingapore defence spending will remain fairly steady, he said. The city-state allocated $8.6 billion in 2004, and increased spending to $12.2 billion last year, he said in Parliament earlier this year.\n\n\"We don't want big dips or big jumps because we feel that's the most disruptive for your militaries,\" he said on Tuesday. \"We've kept pace with real growth, or inflation.\"\n\nTurning back to the regional territorial disputes, Dr Ng said they \"need not be intractable\". \"Neither do they need to precipitate outcomes which would be detrimental to the great promise that Asia holds. This is the region of greatest promise, and greatest performance in the past decade or so. The question, I suppose, to ask is, what are we fighting about?\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

The first flight to use the building, which replaces facilities from the 1950s, was a United Airlines Boeing Co 767 from Chicago.\n\nFlights will be capped at 10 per cent of capacity while systems bed in after the debut of Heathrow's Terminal 5 in 2008 led to a baggage-handling glitch that cost \u00a316 million in expenses and lost revenue.\n\nWith undulating ceilings and a plaza-like departure zone, Terminal 2 will add no new capacity and instead help Heathrow counter the glitz of newer hubs in the Gulf, according to chief executive-designate John Holland-Kaye.\n\nThe biggest challenge may be a unique experiment in scrapping dedicated check-in desks for the 23 Star Alliance airlines that will use the building.\n\n\"It's never been done before at any airport where you have so many carriers working together to implement common check-in,\" said Justin Erbacci, the alliance's vice-president for customer experience and technology. Moving Star carriers to one terminal from three before will also halve minimum connection times to 60 minutes - if the new system works as planned.\n\nSome 600 flights were cancelled or delayed after the botched opening of Terminal 5, and Heathrow is anxious to avoid any repeat as it campaigns for the right to add a third runway after operating close to capacity since the start of the decade.\n\n\"We're in as good a shape as we can be at this stage, given how complex opening a new terminal is,\" Mr Holland-Kaye said, adding that Heathrow has prepared through more than 180 trials with thousands of volunteers standing in as passengers, handling 4,000 bags an hour versus a likely peak of 2,400.\n\nThe reduction in time spent checking in, clearing security and walking to gates means people will have more chance to shop and eat, with UK companies including department store chain John Lewis Partnership plc and pub operator Fuller Smith & Turner plc among those showcased at Heathrow for the first time.\n\nThe building will also boast Michelin-starred chef Heston Blumenthal's first terminal venue. With a wood-burning stove and ice-cream made with liquid nitrogen, The Perfectionists' Cafe will vie for airport honours with outlets from Gordon Ramsey in Terminal 5 and Jamie Oliver at London Gatwick.\n\nBoth Heathrow and Gatwick, 40 km south-east, were identified in December as contenders for new capacity in initial findings from a state-appointed commission.\n\nHeathrow says its \u00a315.6 billion proposal should win out because of the extra connectivity gained in focusing flights on one major air hub.\n\nTerminal 2 demonstrates that Heathrow remains capable of delivering \"massive, complex infrastructure projects\", Mr Holland-Kaye said. Even after its opening week hiccups, Terminal 5, dedicated to British Airways, is now regarded as one of the world's leading airport facilities, he added.\n\nIn addition to Star members including Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Singapore Airlines and Air China, which control just over 20 per cent of capacity at Heathrow, the building will also house Germanwings, Lufthansa's low-cost division, Ireland's Aer Lingus Group plc and Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd short-haul.\n\nThe cap on daily passenger departures will start at 6,000, versus a capacity of about 45,000, with all 26 carriers not scheduled to be fully embedded at the terminal until November.\n\nTerminal 2 has been erected on the footprint of Heathrow's Europa Building, designed to handle 1.2 million people a year in 1955, and will initially be able to process 20 million passengers annually before incorporating space from the former Terminal 1 for a consolidated capacity of 30 million.\n\nTaken together with Terminal 5, the T2 opening means that 70 per cent of customers will pass through buildings less than seven years old, according to owner Heathrow Airport.\n\nMore space has been laid out for orientation, with an atrium-style departure lounge and reduced reliance on stairs and elevators. Some arriving passengers will have a level 200-metre walk from gate to curb via baggage claim and customs. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

FCL has entered into a four-week, exclusive due-diligence period, after which the plan is to launch a binding offer. A key condition is that FCL receives minimum 50.1 per cent acceptance.\n\nCapitaLand had a 59.1 per cent stake in Australand, which it divested itself of in two stages: 20 per cent last November at A$3.685 a stapled security or a total of A$426 million, followed by a sale of the balance 39.12 per cent stake at A$3.75 each raising A$848.8 million. \"This divestment would allow us to reallocate capital to our core businesses in Singapore and China,\" CapitaLand's group CEO Lim Ming Yan said in March.\n\nThe total sales proceeds of around S$1.5 billion would no doubt come in handy for the already cash-rich group in its effort to privatise CapitaMalls Asia.\n\nCapitaLand's involvement with Australand goes back two decades, prior to CapitaLand's formation in 2000 from the merger of DBS Land and Pidemco Land.\n\nIn 1994, DBS Land, helmed by Han Cheng Fong, bought a 65 per cent stake in Australian Housing and Land Group of Companies (AHL), one of Australia's biggest residential property development companies. DBS Land later renamed AHL as Australand and floated it on the Sydney and Singapore bourses in June 1997. In 1999, Australand acquired Walker Corporation, a residential and industrial property developer.\n\nIn November 2003, Australand stapled its shares to units in the then newly created trust, Australand Property Trust (APT), which bought over high-yielding office and industrial properties owned by wholesale property trusts that Australand had spun off a few years earlier. The stapling was aimed at providing greater income stability to stapled security holders than a pure property development business, where incomes are more volatile.\n\nIn early 2008, CapitaLand unveiled a tie-up with Australand to set up a pan-Asian development platform in the industrial/logistics business, though this was put on hold later that year.\n\nCapitaLand never got into the driver's seat at Australand. Granted, this may have been difficult as Australand is a separate listed entity with its own board and management. That said, CapitaLand could have tried to privatise Australand, gaining full exposure to its earnings and improving its return on equity while tapping synergies to scale up operations. This did not happen.\n\nWhen CapitaLand group CEO Liew Mun Leong retired, passing the baton to Lim Ming Yan from Jan 1, 2013, the group said it was reassessing its investment in Australand. It had said at the time that it regarded Australand as more of a financial investment and that the firm had a different business focus from its own.\n\nSo what does FCL see in Australand? And could it not have acquired a controlling stake at a much cheaper price?\n\nFCL did not buy a stake in Australand during CapitaLand's divestment exercises probably because, under Australian law, the maximum it could acquire in Australand outside of an offer is 19.9 per cent. By proposing a cash offer now, it stands to gain full control of Australand.\n\nAustraland's business stretches across Australia and includes development of residential land, housing and apartments in addition to the development of and investment in income-producing commercial and industrial properties. The group is also involved in property management.\n\nFCL entered Australia in 2000. It made its first major acquisition in 2002, when it bought a Sydney CBD site which it has since developed into Lumiere Residences and Frasers Suites Sydney. In 2007, it acquired the former Carlton & United Brewery site in Sydney, which it has started developing into a major urban rejuvenation project, Central Park, comprising residential, office and retail components, over several phases.\n\nThe group also owns and operates serviced residences Down Under while its sponsored Reit Frasers Commercial Trust owns two office buildings in the country - Caroline Chisholm Centre in Canberra, and a 47-storey premium grade office tower in Perth, also named Central Park.\n\nIf FCL gains full control of Australand, it can integrate the two entities and expand its Australia operations significantly. It will also be able to harness Australand's industrial property development expertise to grow this business - whether in Singapore or elsewhere. Even if FCL gains majority, but not full, control of Australand, it stands to enjoy a boost in asset size and earnings. In particular, recurring income will rise, thanks to Australand's attractive commercial and industrial property portfolio. FCL also stands to improve its residential development expertise Down Under.\n\nLast year, Australand generated A$135.3 million net profit attributable to its stapled security holders. CapitaLand's loss could well be FCL's gain.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For instance, certain parts of Russia and Africa may have tracking limitations when it comes to radar and satellite.\n\nIata announced plans to set up the taskforce in April, after MH370 fell off the radar with 239 people on board in March. Some three months have passed since but questions still remain unanswered with regard to what happened on the flight and where the remnants of the plane are.\n\nThe Aircraft Tracking Task Force (ATTF) is made up of representatives from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the airline industry, planemakers, flight safety organisations as well as air navigation service providers.\n\nMr Hiatt was speaking to the media at Iata's annual general meeting (AGM) yesterday in Doha.\n\nThe ATTF, which last met in May, is working on an \"aggressive\" timeline with meetings planned in June, July and August.\n\nIn September, it is due to release a draft list of recommendations to ICAO, which will be passed on to Iata's operations committee in October and its board of directors in December.\n\nThe taskforce is focusing primarily on flight tracking itself, as opposed to real-time flight data streaming. Some 100,000 flights take place globally on average on a daily basis.\n\nIata chief Tony Tyler on Monday refrained from committing to a timeline for the implementation of the new standards.\n\nOne key issue for the industry will be the costs associated with enhanced systems. Mr Hiatt noted that costs may vary, depending on the type of solution employed and the capabilities of the aircraft in question. Governments also \"have a part in this\", he added.\n\nAnother point of contention is whether the tracking system should be made tamper-proof, although pilots prefer to retain the ability to turn off equipment in critical situations, such as a fire.\n\nAbout 1,000 members of the global aviation community have gathered in Doha to attend the 70th Iata AGM, hosted by Qatar Airways which is said to have pushed hard to play host city for the event.\n\nThe flush Gulf carrier dialled up the glitz factor by flying in international pop stars Kylie Minogue and Kelly Rowlands to perform.\n\nThe next AGM is due to take place in Miami from June 7 to 9 next year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Brazil has been rushing to upgrade airports and build stadiums ahead of the event, but not all work has been completed in time. Despite this, officials have stressed that the airports will still be able to receive travellers.\n\nAt the AGM's closing press conference on Tuesday, Iata director-general Tony Tyler reckoned that the World Cup would likely yield a bigger pay-off for the country in the long run than in the short term.\n\n\"The outside world always believes these (events) are a bonanza for airlines. Sadly, that's not always the case. Everyone always wants to travel on the same day and in the same direction, and of course business travel also takes a dive during big events,\" he said.\n\nHe added: \"However, what these events do is they introduce millions and millions of viewers around the world to the country in a way that could never happen before.\"\n\nBusiness and first-class seats can be a big revenue generator for some carriers. Singapore Airlines, for instance, traditionally gets around 40 per cent of its revenue from its premium cabin.\n\nThe press conference, which took place in Doha, was also attended by Air Canada chief executive Calin Rovinescu, who is the new chairman of the Iata board.

This also disappointed market economists who had expected that the index - seen as a barometer of manufacturing activity - would rise to 51.3 last month.\n\nHowever, by keeping above the 50-point threshold which demarcates expansion from contraction, the PMI still signalled growth, just at a slower pace. And the electronics PMI, which held steady at 50.4 in May, was an encouraging sign to observers, particularly after April's manufacturing figures presented a surprise dip due to a cutback in production at a single semiconductor plant.\n\nSingapore's overall reading was not inconsistent with the mixed set of May PMI reports from across the region this past week.\n\nTaiwan's HSBC PMI, also released yesterday, rose marginally to 52.4 in May, from 52.3 in April. But its manufacturing sector still lacks momentum as domestic demand remains weak, HSBC economist John Zhu said. South Korea's PMI dipped into contraction zone with a reading of 49.5, while Japan's remained unchanged at 49.9.\n\nMore importantly, for many of Singapore's producers, China's HSBC PMI rose to a four-month high. The reading of 49.4 signalled less of a deterioration in business conditions, an improvement that was in line with China's official PMI for May. The official PMI showed manufacturing growing at its fastest pace in five months, backing views that the China government's targeted measures to boost growth are gaining momentum.\n\nDBS economist Irvin Seah expects the improvement in China's manufacturing to have an impact on Singapore, after a brief time lag. He thinks that the PMI will continue to ease to the 50-point mark in the next couple of months, but that manufacturing will keep growing, month on month. \"We will see a more sustained improvement when we move into the second half,\" Mr Seah said.\n\nBarclays economist Leong Wai Ho thinks that with better external economic conditions, the dip in May PMI warrants little concern. \"The improving US investment cycle tells us to expect more orders from G-3 in the coming months and that orders from North Asia for Singapore will start to pick up as well,\" he said.\n\nBoth Mr Leong and Mr Seah see the lower PMI as due to a running down of inventories, as local manufacturers tweak activity levels to adjust for overly optimistic production in the first few months of the year. Mr Leong said: \"This behaviour tends to precede a fresh wave of re-stocking, which we expect will lift PMIs higher in Q3. Apple's new phone will be released then, and is expected to provide some impetus to purchasing activity.\"\n\nSigns of this can also be picked up from the PMI's imports sub-index's continued expansion, said Janice Ong, executive director of the Singapore Institute of Purchasing & Materials Management, which polls more than 150 industrial companies to compile the monthly PMI. This indicates that \"local manufacturers are anticipating a surge in order demands in coming months\", she said.\n\nBut Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Chua Hak Bin was less bullish about manufacturers' outlook. \"The much-anticipated pick-up in global demand may remain patchy and elusive, given the tepid US recovery and China's mini fiscal austerity.\"\n\nOCBC economist Selena Ling, too, believes that the Asian manufacturing and export recovery theme remains in an infancy stage for now. And the slipping sub-indices of the electronics PMI - for inventory, imports and order backlog - could be read as hints \"that the thus far resilient electronics industry may find it challenging to continue to hold up growth momentum\", she said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Four in five of the Reits' property assets are unencumbered.\n\nComparing sectors, the refinancing flexibility of the retail sector is marginally weaker, while the healthcare sector's is stronger.\n\nReits here also have healthy FFO (funds from operations) interest coverage - a metric Fitch uses to measure a Reit's financial flexibility by comparing its operational cash-generating ability to its financing costs.\n\nFFO interest coverage for the Reit sector rose to 4.8 times last year, from 4.1 times in 2012, the report revealed, although it pointed out that this was more because of lower all-in borrowing costs rather than higher profitability.\n\nMore than half of the S-Reit sector's debt was priced at fixed rates at end-March 2014. Assuming a stress scenario where the proportion of fixed-rate debt falls to 30 per cent and interest rates rise by 300 per cent, FFO interest coverage would still have remained solid at 2.0 times in 2013, the credit ratings agency said.\n\nFitch expects rental growth and occupancy rates across most property sectors to stay pressured as the supply of floor space outpaces demand, supported by cheap domestic financing.\n\nRetail Reits with assets in greater China such as CapitaRetail China Trust, as well as industrial Reits with warehouse assets such as Mapletree Logistics Trust are likely to be more affected than others.\n\nAnd if occupancy rates and rental reversions were to decline more than expected, it would further lead to lower property valuations and weaken the refinancing flexibility of Reits here, it warned.\n\nEarlier this week, Maybank Kim Eng issued a report upgrading S-Reits from underweight to neutral, in expectation of a more prolonged low interest rate environment which will help to hold up property valuation.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But while the first century of paid flight has transformed the passenger experience from a bone-shaking wooden biplane to frills such as flat beds, for many investors it provides the same risk of getting wet as the original hop across Tampa Bay.\n\nGlobal airlines made US$13 billion last year, but an ongoing centennial gathering in Doha will hear that margins remain thin, and the industry has rarely if ever covered its cost of capital since the original St Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line.\n\nAt the heart of the problem is a debate about whether a unique system of ownership controls and bilateral agreements, which make it hard for airlines to combine, should be relaxed.\n\n\"We as an industry wish that we were treated like any other industry and were able to buy and sell across borders, and merge and do business like any other business,\" said Tony Tyler, director-general of the International Air Transport Association (Iata) whose more than 200 members are meeting in Doha until today.\n\n\"After 100 years, we haven't found a way of doing that and governments haven't found a way of letting us do it - not yet,\" he said ahead of Iata's annual meeting, where a replica of the first boatplane has been given pride of place.\n\nAbout 3,000 people gathered to watch the original plane make the first scheduled flight, which took place a long way from the storm clouds of conflict gathering in Europe.\n\nBut experts say the background to today's ownership debate lies in decisions taken after the last century's wars, when airspace was deemed sovereign partly due to fears of militarisation. The alternative, treating the sky like the high seas, was rejected.\n\nThose fears have retreated but the bureaucratic landscape remains, with the industry ruled by bilateral traffic rights limiting market access, and backed up by ownership restrictions that help to preserve more than 1,000 airlines.\n\nDespite extensive deregulation and consolidation in the United States and Europe, airline leaders say ownership barriers are hampering efforts to cope with high fixed costs.\n\n\"It is a very fragmented industry because you can't consolidate across political borders,\" Mr Tyler said. \"If you take the rules that run airlines and translate them into another industry, you do get some pretty funny ideas. The consequences seem bizarre, yet those are the ones we work in.\"\n\nThe sheer scale of the Iata event staged each year is proof of the industry's dispersal. Without foreign ownership controls, such a summit of industry leaders might look rather different.\n\n\"You could have five, 10 or 20 big global brands competing with each other wherever they go, possibly with differing regional strengths in different parts of the world,\" Mr Tyler said, asked what the industry would look like with free ownership. \"I am sure you would still find regional airlines would make a tidy living as specialists in particular regions.\"\n\nPrivately, some airline chiefs put it more bluntly.\n\n\"There are quite a few airlines here that just shouldn't be around,\" one delegate said. Some Iata members are fighting to repel incursions by foreign airlines into their markets through subsidiaries.\n\nStill, airlines have been creative about getting around the foreign ownership curbs that exist in most of the world's markets, forging global alliances and setting up powerful revenue-sharing ventures on key markets such as the Atlantic.\n\nAbu Dhabi's Etihad took a step towards expanding an alternative model based on building minority equity stakes and sharing procurement decisions when it offered a long-awaited tie-up on Sunday with Italian carrier Alitalia. Others such as Asia's largest low-cost airline AirAsia, which is not a member of Iata, opt to franchise a single brand through numerous loosely controlled affiliates.\n\nMr Tyler said the cost structures of low-cost airlines and the traditional network carriers would converge, especially when the time comes to share the cost of new airport infrastructure, and that more non-traditional airlines would be welcome in Iata. -Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM\n\nNissan poised to offer record-high coupon in US$4 billion bond sale\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:03 AM", "images": []}

That plane will be bigger and more efficient than the current 777, a twin-engine aircraft so capable that it's cannibalising Boeing's jumbo sales.\n\nCommercial success has proved elusive for the 747-8, the latest update to an almost 50-year-old plane known for its distinctive humpbacked fuselage. While the 747-8 is a lock to win bidding that opens this year to replace the president's fleet, waning demand for the cargo variant further imperils an assembly line that has slowed to just 1.5 planes a month.\n\n\"Air Force One is it unless a miracle happens in the airfreight business,\" said Glen Langdon, president of Langdon Asset Management, a San Francisco firm that has extensive experience selling used 747s and other wide-body freighters.\n\nDiscussions with Emirates were disclosed this week by John Wojick, senior vice-president for sales and marketing at Chicago-based Boeing's commercial airplane unit, at the annual meeting of the International Air Transport Association in Doha. Emirates is the world's largest international airline and it operates a fleet of A380s from rival Airbus Group.\n\nBoeing is fighting to land customers, even using trade-ins of older models to seal deals. Boeing faces a \"material\" accounting loss if it can't win sufficient 747 orders to recover the costs of development, according to a company filing. So far, Boeing has tallied just 51 sales for the passenger variant, known as the 747-8I or Intercontinental, since Deutsche Lufthansa placed the first order in 2006.\n\nThis year's 747-8 order count: one. It wasn't always so grim. Pan American World Airways announced a US$525 million order for 25 of the first 747s in 1966, effectively launching a programme that would go on to produce almost 1,500 planes.\n\nBut Boeing outdid itself with the 777-9X, the first twin-engine jet designed to carry a jumbo's haul of 407 passengers.\n\nMeanwhile, a glut of the previous 747 iteration remain parked and Boeing cut 747 production twice last year, to 18 jets a year, as the backlog dwindled. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

But recognising the increased competition in commodity trade finance in the region, the bank plans to be very selective in its focus, top executives told The Business Times in an interview.\n\nThe bank is embarking on a new frontier, with a three-pronged strategy to achieve a 12-16 per cent return on equity in 2017. \"This is going to be done through selective growth in our core expertise and franchise, cost control and being very productive and efficient in how we use our capital in our day-to-day business,\" said Olivier Perquel, head of financing and global markets in Asia Pacific.\n\nInternationalisation is a key thrust for the bank, with plans to increase net revenue from wholesale banking in international markets by 10 per cent each year.\n\n\"We are pushing our efforts in Asia in a number of areas. We're pushing on our distribution capability, and we're doing it very aggressively,\" said Mr Perquel.\n\nNatixis, which is 73 per cent owned by Banques Populaires Caisses d'Epargne (BCPE), the mutual retail bank, has wholesale banking, insurance and asset management businesses. The fourth largest bank in France by market value, it was hit hard by the financial crisis, having heavily invested in US subprime debt. BCPE stepped in to ringfence and guarantee billions of euros of toxic assets in 2009, and also changed its management then.\n\nThis took place shortly after Natixis was formed in November 2006 from the merger of the corporate and investment banking activities of French mutual banks Banque Populaire and Caisse d'Epargne. The bank is now shifting away from businesses with high capital requirements, towards corporate and investment banking, investment solutions and specialised financing services.\n\n\"Since 2009, we've changed the culture to a more client-specific approach. We cannot be everything to everyone,\" Mr Perquel said. \"We want to be adding value to selected clients as much as possible.\"\n\nThe group has set aside a budget of up to 1.5 billion euros (S$2.6 billion) for acquisitions to expand in the asset management area, seeing it as a way of reducing the risk of the group's balance sheet and mitigating the impact of higher regulatory capital requirements. It now has 630 billion euros of assets under management, with half in the US.\n\nIts Singapore portfolio has grown by almost 50 per cent in the past three years, and is expected to increase by 5-7 per cent this year. In Singapore, where it has been operational for more than 30 years and a 110-strong staff now, the bank will focus on structured finance in energy and metals, fixed income and equity derivatives.\n\nSaid Pin Chua, senior country manager of Singapore: \"Now that we have substantial presence among traders, we're going back into the producers. We're adding value to the chain. We're focusing and investing more and more in areas we'll do well in.\"\n\nEven as it does so, the bank is cognisant of increased competition in commodity trade finance. But it is banking on its global reach to offer a different type of service to its clients, especially for large energy players.\n\n\"Having a global perspective gives us an advantage over some of the regional banks,\" said Mr Chua. \"If a company has only domestic needs, there's no interest from them, and no interest from us. What gives us a value proposition is the global set-up and going to our clients to say what is going on in Africa, what's going on in the US . . . we don't have to bank everybody, and we cannot bank everybody.\"\n\nHe also notes that competition is not always a zero-sum game. \"Clients are becoming increasingly bigger, and the amounts they need are larger. So, pretty much, we need several banks to work together.\"\n\nThe commodity financing business has accounted for about 35 per cent of Natixis' revenues in Singapore in the past three years, and 20 per cent in Asia Pacific. The bank will focus on where it can add value, such as structuring deals, where it can lend its expertise in controlling the balance between risk and reward, and bringing other banks along in these.\n\n\"By size we're definitely not the biggest lender. We don't have the most people,\" said Mr Chua. \"Being small and nimble, we can be just as effective, if not more.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That list of developed markets will be based on classifications by index operators MSCI and FTSE.\n\nSecondary-listing companies that are not from those 23 markets will continue to be subject to current additional obligations, which usually involve rules on interested party transaction, major deals and delistings.\n\nThe proposal will codify the existing practice of requiring secondary-listed companies to maintain a primary listing in another exchange.\n\nThe public consultation ends on June 25; implementation is planned for the fourth quarter of this year.\n\nThe changes are unlikely to have much impact on the 33 existing secondary-listed companies. Only two - Japan's Tosei Corp and Switzerland's Lonza Group - which fall in the \"developed\" camp have additional obligations imposed on them now. SGX plans to remove those extra requirements three months after the start of the new regime to give investors an adjustment period.\n\nSecondary-listed stocks formed $269 billion or 29 per cent of the entire Singapore market's value as at end-2013. They contributed $13.1 billion in turnover last year, or 4 per cent of total trading value.\n\nThe proposals could have a greater impact on SGX's ability to get listed companies from established foreign exchanges to pursue a secondary listing here. The number of such listings has grown from 26 in 2010 to 33 today.\n\nThe exchange's regulation of secondary listings has come under scrutiny in recent months, following reports that five companies in the Jardine stable could be looking to change their listing status in London to avoid more stringent governance rules there.\n\nSGX head of issuer regulation Mohamed Nasser Ismail stressed that the change will not reduce the level of oversight over secondary-listed companies from developed markets because their home jurisdictions already have robust regulatory systems. Rather, the exchange is framing the changes as a way to streamline and clarify its position on secondary listings.\n\nSGX head of listings for South-east Asia Simon Lim said that the current uncertainty over what additional conditions the exchange might impose on a secondary listing has been confusing for potential issuers.\n\n\"Now we tell them that, 'Look, hey, if you're one of the 23 jurisdictions, we welcome you, no additional conditions'. And that's very clear,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It stems from the time when charters were agreed with a handshake on the trading floor. But it still conveys the message of a commitment to honesty and integrity.\n\nThe independent tanker owners seem to have had something similar in mind at the recent meeting in New York of Intertanko (International Association of Independent Tanker Owners).\n\nAccording to an Intertanko statement, \"to demonstrate Members' commitment to Intertanko's Tanker Industry Voluntary Code of Conduct and their commitment to best practice in general, the vast majority of council members endorsed the Code of Conduct during their recent meeting in New York by publicly signing it on a large banner\".\n\nIt is interesting that the vast majority of council members signed the banner. Does that mean the tiny minority were absent and unable to sign?\n\nIntertanko says it has drawn up its code of conduct \"in order to assist in promoting a collective responsibility to act at all times with the highest standards of honesty, integrity and respect towards one another, to encourage compliance with general standards of good corporate citizenship\".\n\nThe Intertanko website carries a statement explaining and detailing the code: \"In order to support the fundamental objective of the industry, namely the safe and efficient seaborne transportation and delivery of the world's oil and petrochemical resources, we as signatories of the Code of Conduct undertake to:\n\nIntertanko says it will now seek further engagement with its members and associate members as well as other stakeholders.\n\nSo, is this code worthwhile? The pledges all appear very general and judging whether a company is keeping to them will be very subjective.\n\nPerhaps the only real way of answering that is to see what happens when Intertanko members break the code. It is voluntary so presumably the only sanction is the disapproval of fellow membership. However, other companies and organisations can now presumably point to the code whenever they believe they have a grievance against an Intertanko member.\n\nExplaining the initiative, Intertanko says it remains determined to identify ways to make tanker shipping more sustainable and viable in the long term. It adds: \"While continuing to be involved with the environmental and social aspects of sustainability, the strategic focus of members is on those commercial aspects which remain constant whether the market is low or high, such as specifically driving down the cost of vetting, rebalancing eroded charter party terms, and monitoring charterers' payment performance for freight, demurrage and other claims.\"\n\nThe link between those understandable commercial objectives and the code do seem rather tenuous. Nevertheless, Intertanko says the ultimate aim of its Sustainability Project is to help bring about changes in behaviour which make the tanker business function better for all involved.\n\nIt would probably a mistake to be too dismissive of the idea of voluntary codes. Intertanko should be congratulated for at least bringing the issue of business ethics to the fore.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They also backed a plan to give Citic Pacific direct exposure to the mainland's banking sector - and along with that, the country's bad loans problems.\n\n\"This landmark transaction will transform our company, giving our shareholders enhanced return, better earnings visibility and a much bigger-scale platform,\" Citic Pacific chairman Chang Zhenming said in a statement.\n\nThe purchase was approved by 99 per cent of votes at yesterday's meeting, according to a securities filing.\n\nYet, how Citic Pacific plans to chart a safe and rewarding path through China's murky banking sector remains unclear. Some analysts are also concerned about Citic Pacific's ability to manage a diversified conglomerate that would include financial services alongside its current steel and property businesses.\n\nThe deal centres on the acquisition of Citic Ltd, the chief operating arm of Citic Group.\n\nCitic Ltd's businesses range from real estate and natural resources to engineering. But it derives its income mainly from financial services, which accounted for 87.3 per cent of pretax profit in 2013.\n\nDriving the bulk of the segment's earnings is China Citic Bank Corp. While Citic Bank is profitable, it is, like other Chinese lenders, exposed to a rising tide of souring loans as China's economy slows.\n\n\"Investors may take a cautious note on their increased exposure to China's banking sector amid prevailing concerns about the slowing Chinese economy and potential increase in bad debts,\" said Ben Kwong, KGI Asia's head of research. \"This will be a real challenge for Citic Pacific, and only time will tell whether they could navigate out of this situation successfully.\"\n\nCitic Ltd, as a whole, has also expanded into riskier, higher-yielding areas including wealth management. Its so-called \"maximum loss exposure\" to higher-yielding investments jumped 36 times to 322 billion yuan (S$64.7 billion) at the end of 2013 from 8.97 billion in 2011, according to a disclosure by Citic Pacific to its shareholders in April.\n\nChinese banks, one of the conduits of such products, earn fees by offering retail investors high-yielding investment products, often backed by loans to borrowers that are struggling to access normal lending channels. Such borrowers include property developers, local governments and firms in sectors hit by overcapacity in a slower economy.\n\nAnalysts widely expected minority shareholders to approve the deal after some of them - including Temasek Holdings, Qatar Holding and AIA Group Ltd - agreed to help finance the acquisition.\n\n\"Citic Pacific will become a diversified conglomerate offering an opportunity to engage directly in China's next round of development,\" an external spokesman for Citic Pacific said.\n\nAnalysts say Citic Pacific has to show it has the management prowess to sail through with confidence. But confidence is a scarce commodity these days after the company miscalculated the huge cost of developing a mine in Western Australia in recent years. The company also made wrong-way bets on the Australian dollar while hedging currency risks linked to its mining investment.\n\n\"The company has a disappointing track record, which is a big worry when investors look at the current situation,\" KGI Asia's Mr Kwong said. \"The key challenge is to hire top-quality managers and make them responsible for their actions.\"\n\nBut the sense of caution is countered by the prospect of improving financials. The combined Citic entity is estimated to be more profitable, with return on equity (ROE) forecast to rise four basis points to 13 per cent, Jefferies estimates.\n\nIn comparison, Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing's conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa Ltd generates a 7.6 per cent ROE, while Swire Pacific Ltd achieves 6.2 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n\n\"We continue to view the 'New Citic' to be a good proxy for the Chinese economy,\" Jefferies analyst Christie Ju wrote in a note. \"We expect minority shareholders to support the acquisition, and expect 'New Citic' to become the largest (in revenue, asset and market cap) and potentially the most profitable Chinese conglomerate in the Hong Kong market.\"\n\nThe deal, first unveiled in March, has been hailed as the biggest SOE reform in China. It changes Citic Pacific's business mix considerably, with financial services set to bring in more than a third of the new Citic Pacific's revenue and resource and energy accounting for just over a fifth, according to Jefferies.\n\nCitic Group is wholly owned by the Chinese State Council, or Cabinet. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nLG Electronics shares jump on report of AI chip gear development\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:27 AM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nUS tariffs put spotlight on industrial S-Reits\u2019 upcoming H1 earnings\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM", "images": []}

However, he pointed out, the tighter requirements under Basel III may limit banks' capacity to provide long-tenure loans down the road.\n\nInstitutional investors can plug this financing gap; Singapore-based infrastructure fund managers, for example, have grown their assets under management by 40 per cent since 2009.\n\nThe minister suggested that transactions be structured so that institutional investors take over the financing of projects from banks when construction is done.\n\n\"To enable institutional investors to participate, the industry could establish a set of guidelines for the structuring of project loans, such that the loans can be easily transferable between bank and non-bank markets. These guidelines would aim to ensure that project loans have portable guarantees, readily available credit ratings and standardised project-finance terms and documentation,\" he said.\n\nMr Lim also called for public and private-sector professionals to be trained: \"If infrastructure is to be defined as a new asset class, we need a talent pool with specialised knowledge in developing, managing and financing projects.\" If the above measures are taken, he said, Singapore is likely to unlock another US$300 billion of infrastructure opportunity each year, which will boost Asia's GDP by 2.5 per cent over 10 years.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Just which firm is in Mr Ma's crosshair is not clear yet.\n\nAsiatravel has been suffering losses in recent years right up to the latest January to March quarter where it bled more red ink of some $1.8 million from $1.7 million a year ago.\n\nThe share price performance of Asiatravel in recent months indicates that some corporate activity may be in the offing.\n\nIn fact, the counter, hardly one that used to spring up on trader's radar and long languishing on anaemic trading, hit a 21-month high of 33 cents yesterday after gaining 0.5 cent or 1.5 per cent.\n\nTrading volume the day before was notably high with four million shares done, way past the daily average of some 390,000 over the one-year period.\n\nThe flutter of activity in the counter began months earlier. On March 19, Singapore Exchange shot out a trading activity query to Asiatravel and a day later issued a \"trade with caution\" note on its shares.\n\nOn March 17, based on SGX filings, Dr Ong Nai Pew, Asiatravel's former chief executive officer and its chairman in 2004 and 2005, acquired 1.02 million Asiatravel shares for $209,800, raising his stake from 6 per cent to 6.4 per cent.\n\nOn Feb 25, Beijing Toread Outdoor Products, which is listed on Shenzhen Stock Exchange, snapped up 20 million Asiatravel shares in an off-market transaction for $4 million, upping its stake from 14 per cent acquired from a share placement four months earlier to 21.2 per cent.\n\nOn its part, Asiatravel has not shied away from publicly indicating that mergers and acquisitions may be on the cards.\n\nLast month, as it released a weak financial scorecard for the second quarter, Asiatravel said it was in \"advance discussions with various parties to explore all strategic and M&A options\".\n\nIt repeated a similar point - that \"it has been engaging various parties\" to explore options to strengthen its business amid a competitive landscape in the global online travel realm - in a response to SGX's March query.\n\nAsiatravel's main dilemma is the growing traffic in a crowded space as more online travel agencies scramble for a piece of the action.\n\nThe firm's main appeal, one that it has built up over the years and which may be hard to replicate, according to an analyst, is its one-stop online business model which provides customers instant confirmation at a single click for hotel, flight and tour package bookings in 12 countries across Asia, Europe and the Middle East.\n\nIt could be this that has caught the attention of its big Chinese suitors eager to tap the hot outbound Chinese tourists market which last year reportedly hit a record 100 million travellers.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Deloitte's report noted increased trade flows to emerging markets, with much coming from within the region itself. It also said that, while emerging markets and developed markets each account for half of the world's gross domestic product (GDP) today, emerging markets are likely to account for a larger proportion in future.\n\nIt also pointed to the Fortune Global 500 list, which has a declining number of North American and European financial services firms, and a growing number of those based in Asia, Central and Latin America.\n\nAlong with those, Deloitte's report says, emerging markets-based banks' experience of operating in volatile markets, combined with their knowledge of how to reach unbanked and underbanked customers, place them in an advantageous position of expanding into developed and other emerging markets.\n\nJim Reichbach, Deloitte global leader, banking and securities, adds: \"Emerging markets-based banks often have limited domestic expansion opportunities. Accordingly, these banks are looking at international opportunities, including M&A (merger and acquisition) transactions, as their customers expand into new markets and their citizens immigrate to new countries.\"\n\nAcquisitions from emerging markets are, indeed, expected to be on the rise. The World Bank, in its 2011 Global Development Horizons report, projected that the annual value of cross-border M&A transactions will double by 2025, outpacing the underlying GDP growth rates in emerging-market firms' home countries.\n\nFor South-east Asia, in particular, Deloitte believes the opportunities come amidst challenges. Deloitte South-east Asia's financial services industry leader, Ho Kok Yong, says: \"The weakened economies of the United States and Europe, traditional trading partners with Asia, have led countries in South-east Asia to look for market opportunities closer to home. Heavy regulation of the banking system in countries like Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam have led to increased competitiveness with high banking penetration in second-tier cities.\"\n\nTo help cope with some of these challenges, Deloitte's report does lay out key steps that banks in emerging markets can take in their expansion plans, including assessing their readiness along the way.\n\nThese include: understanding what market segments to pursue; defining a clear strategy for international expansion; having adequate technology and business systems; understanding the nuances of the local regulatory regime, and having people who understand the culture, language, and business practices in emerging markets.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By increasing the share of natural gas used in electricity generation, from less than 20 per cent in 2000 to above 90 per cent today, we have substantially reduced our emissions growth for the power sector,\" an Energy Market Authority spokesperson said.\n\nA major catalyst was the development of the Singapore LNG terminal with the availability of liquefied natural gas feedstock encouraging the recent genco investments in new gas-firing plants here.\n\n\"Singapore is also exploring ways to increase our use of solar energy, which is clean and has zero emission. Another priority is to improve energy efficiency which will help to reduce emission by lowering energy consumption,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nIn that respect, \"for power sector carbon emissions, the US and Singapore have very different starting points\".\n\nReportedly one of the most significant US environmental proposals to date, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to slash carbon emissions in the US power sector by proposing that the industry cut its 2005-level carbon dioxide emissions by 30 per cent come 2030.\n\nThis looks set to transform the US industry, where coal-firing accounts for nearly 38 per cent of electricity generation. The new rules will affect roughly 1,000 power plants there which account for nearly 40 per cent of carbon emissions, and which will, for the first time, face limits on carbon pollution.\n\nAlso significantly, the EPA rules, when finalised, are expected to give Washington greater leeway in international talks next year to develop a framework to fight climate change, with this having implications for other industrial economies, like India and China. UN climate chief Christiana Figueres reportedly said: \"I fully expect action by the US to spur others into taking action.\"\n\nStates in the US will reportedly have various options like improving power plant heat rates; replacing coal with natural gas-firing plants; ramping up zero-carbon energy like solar power; and increasing energy efficiency.\n\nOne industry official here told BT yesterday: \"The move from coal to gas-firing in the power sector there is opportune, especially with the US moving to tap gas supplies from shale projects there.\"\n\nIn Singapore, the only coal-fired facility is Tuas Power's Tembusu multi-utilities complex which makes use of low-sulphur coal (80 per cent) and biomass like palm shell kernels and wood waste (20 per cent). Because of the biomass use, the plant's advanced technology such as special circulating fluidised boilers, and careful handling of the coal and coal ash, TMUC's emission levels are reportedly even lower than some oil-fired power plants.\n\nUse of alternatives like solar is also starting to gain traction, with Singapore recently raising its cap on such intermittent generation sources from 350MW to 600MW - the latter representing 10 per cent of peak electricity demand here of around 6,000 MW. The cap is to ensure there is sufficient electricity reserve (from the gencos) to back up the intermittent energy sources and ensure power system stability.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Life insurers' portfolios, on average, lost 0.8 per cent in 2013, according to SNL Financial. Those weak returns, along with more competition from private pension funds for the supply of US corporate bonds, have prompted US life insurers to consider riskier strategies to provide richer compensation.\n\n\"The key focus for us is the race for yield,\" said Todd Hedtke, vice-president for investment management at Allianz Life Insurance of North America, which has US$80 billion in assets in the US. Allianz Life, owned by Allianz Group in Germany, has invested in such projects as toll roads and stadiums and in renewable energy initiatives such as wind parks and solar farms. On a global basis, Allianz Group has made about US$2 billion of such investments since the beginning of 2013, with Allianz Life accounting for about US$400 million.\n\nUS life insurance firms, with investable assets of about US$3.5 trillion at the end of 2013, are one of the largest sources of investment capital, representing 64 per cent of the total US insurance industry.\n\nDavid Lomas, head of BlackRock's global financial institutions group, said he has seen insurer assets in hedge funds, private equity and real estate rise by about 10 per cent over the last five years.\n\nThe foray into alternative investments shows how major investors are making changes to deal with low interest rates. Long-term assets such as real estate generally preserve value during uncertain economic periods, but carry risks due to their illiquidity.\n\n\"When you invest in equity-style assets such as equity real estate, they're very good matches for our long-term liabilities, which don't come due until 30, 40 or 50 years later,\" said Richard Leist, managing director at MetLife Inc's global portfolio management group, which has assets of roughly US$500 billion.\n\nMetLife is one of the largest investors in the property market, with nearly US$55 billion in real estate assets. Early this year, MetLife and Norges Bank Investment Management, Norway's sovereign wealth fund, jointly invested in office properties in Boston, Washington and San Francisco with an estimated value of US$1.7 billion.\n\nMore than a third, or 35 per cent, of chief investment officers of 233 global insurance companies intend to increase overall portfolio risk over the next 12 months, while only 8 per cent said they will decrease risk, a recent Goldman Sachs Asset Management survey showed. About 29 per cent of chief investment officers said they will raise holdings of infrastructure debt, 28 per cent will increase allocation to private equity, 26 per cent to commercial mortgage loans, and 26 per cent to real estate.\n\nAllianz's Mr Hedtke aims to shift 10 per cent of his firm's assets into less traditional investments in the next three to five years. \"Long-dated, illiquid types of assets that also tend to be a little more complex tend to be where we focus,\" he said. \"Private projects like infrastructure and renewable energy stuff are where you see new efforts and renewed focus among insurers.\"\n\nIn the case of infrastructure debt, default rates are low while credit quality improves over time as the long-term project gets completed.\n\nThat said, illiquid investments have inherent risks. They do not trade often and therefore can't be sold quickly without a discount. For many life insurers now at their healthiest since the global financial crisis, the risks are worth taking. \"It's important to point out that generally speaking, illiquid investments tend to have much stronger covenants and contracts embedded for investors than most public investments,\" said MetLife's Mr Leist.\n\nTraditionally, life insurance firms are very large owners of corporate bonds - about 60 per cent of their portfolios at the end of 2013, data from the US National Association of Insurance Commissioners showed.\n\nUS corporate bond issuance for 30-year maturities has been steady so far this year, but competition from other institutional investors such as corporate pension funds has increased for the same amount of supply, pushing down yields. The additional competition has forced spreads over US Treasuries to tighten.\n\nThe extra yield buyers demand to hold corporate bonds instead of government debt has narrowed 0.36 percentage points since May 2013 when expectations rose about the Federal Reserve tapering its bond purchases. According to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Master Index, the composite spread on high-grade bonds was at 1.11 percentage points or the tightest level since 2007. The tightening of spreads in junk-rated bonds has been more dramatic. The composite spread on junk bonds was at 3.75 percentage points on May 30, or 0.75 percentage point tighter than the May 1, 2013, levels.\n\nUS Treasury debt yields rose in 2013, compressing the unrealised gain that had been embedded in the portfolios of insurance companies, said BlackRock's Mr Lomas. Returns came to a loss of 0.8 per cent on their portfolios last year, according to data from SNL Financial, a business intelligence data provider in Charlottesville, Virginia. In the three years ending 2013, the return was 4.67 per cent.\n\nThe rise in long-dated yields has also curbed issuance of 30-year bonds - which life insurers like because they're used to match long-dated liabilities - at a time when the competition for new issuance has grown more fierce. \"Should rates rise, we would expect long corporate supply to diminish further as funding costs become less attractive to corporations,\" said John Melvin, global head of insurance fixed income at Goldman Sachs Asset Management's insurance asset management group It's no wonder insurers are looking for alternatives. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": []}

The MSCI emerging markets index has climbed 9.8 per cent since mid-March, more than twice as much as the MSCI World Index. US exchange-traded funds that invest in developing nations have lured about US$8.7 billion of inflows during the period.\n\nFor Korea, \"staying an emerging market is better for flows at the moment\", said Arthur Kwong, the Hong Kong-based head of Asia Pacific equities at BNP Paribas Investment Partners, which manages about US$650 billion.\n\nKorean shares comprise about 16 per cent of the MSCI emerging gauge, the second-highest weighting among 21 countries after China's 19 per cent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with 11 per cent for Brazil and 7 per cent for India.\n\nIf it were included in the MSCI World index of advanced-nation shares, Korea would take up a smaller proportion, said Kim Chul Min, a money manager at Mirae Asset Global Investments in Seoul. The nation's US$1.3 trillion market capitalisation is about 5 per cent of America's US$23 trillion market. It's also smaller than that of Japan, the UK, Hong Hong, Canada, France, Germany, Australia and Switzerland.\n\nIn the four years since Israel was upgraded to developed-market status from emerging, MSCI's gauge for the country has lost about 6.7 per cent. It trailed the MSCI World Index by 84 percentage points and lagged behind the emerging-market measure by about 30 points.\n\n\"You might attract a different type of investor, but even if they get promoted to developed status, the proportion may be smaller,\" said Nicholas Yeo, a Hong Kong-based money manager at Aberdeen Asset Management plc, which oversees about US$541 billion worldwide.\n\nMSCI has been consulting with investors on whether to categorise South Korea as a developed market since 2008. While the country has met most of the index provider's criteria, including economic development and liquidity, MSCI said in last year's classification review that the limited convertibility of the won in offshore currency markets and a rigid investor identification system prevented an upgrade.\n\nThe index provider is also considering an upgrade of Taiwan to developed-market status, along with the inclusion of China's mainland-traded shares in the MSCI Emerging Markets index.\n\nMSCI declined to comment on its market classifications before next week's announcement, saying the information is \"price sensitive\", Chia Chin-Ping, the Hong Kong-based head of research for MSCI in Asia, said by e-mail.\n\nKorea Exchange is aware of concerns raised by MSCI, though the bourse hasn't seen \"much improvement\" compared to last year, Kim Ki Kyung, team manager of the Kospi market trading rule and regulation division, said by phone on May 30.\n\nThe MSCI Korea index has slipped 0.4 per cent this year, versus a 0.5 per cent drop in the benchmark Kospi index. The MSCI gauge is valued at 1.04 times net assets, compared with 1.5 for the emerging-market index and 2.2 for the MSCI World.\n\nThe won has strengthened 3.1 per cent against the dollar this year, while the yield on benchmark three-year bonds has dropped eight basis points to 2.83 per cent.\n\nAn upgrade to developed-market status by MSCI would expose Korea's biggest companies to a wider pool of investor money and provide a potential boost to the nation's technology and auto exporters, said Lee Jae Hun, a Seoul-based analyst at Mirae Asset Securities Co. About US$2.3 trillion is benchmarked against the MSCI World index, versus US$1.3 trillion for the emerging-market gauge.\n\nSamsung Electronics Co, the world's biggest smartphone maker and Korea's biggest company by market value, trades at about seven times reported earnings.

These can range from weather seasons which can increase demand for energy, to the start of Indian festivals that boost demand for gold.\n\nThe index invests across 25 commodities, placing long and short trades - bullish and bearish bets respectively - on them in various months, or choosing not to have any exposure at all in certain months. It aims to capture price changes driven by seasonal shift, using a matrix of 72 seasonal factors to determine the exposure to each commodity, and is rebalanced monthly.\n\nWhile commodity prices might also be affected by \"exogenous\" factors, the framework of seasonal effects still works, albeit with either an amplified or muted impact, said Mr Keenan.\n\nEach commodity is also a sub-index on its own, allowing investors to invest in specific commodities or create their own portfolio mix. \"We try to make everything as lego-like as possible,\" said Mr Keenan.\n\nA few private banks and one Asian sovereign wealth fund have already started using the index, he said.\n\nThis follows another index, the Societe Generale Supply Demand Commodity Index, which the bank started a year ago. The long-only index, which allocates to commodities according to changes in supply and demand, is doing \"very very well, with many types of investors tracking it\", said Mr Keenan, though he declined to reveal how much money is currently linked to it.\n\nInvestors have started looking at commodities as an asset class again this year, as the unusually high correlation levels with other asset classes such as equities since 2008 have eased, and commodities start to be driven by fundamental factors again. This enhances the diversification appeal of the asset class, said Mr Keenan.\n\nA Barclays survey published on April 4 showed that 54 per cent of investors planned to boost their stake in commodities in the next 12 months, compared with 27 per cent who indicated so in the year before, Bloomberg reported.\n\nGoldman Sachs has also raised its 12-month allocation for commodities from \"underweight\" to \"neutral\" in a May 13 report.\n\n\"As the global business cycle shifts into an expansion phase over the next few years, we expect commodity performance to improve,\" said the Goldman Sach analysts.\n\nThe two most commonly tracked commodity indices - the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index and the Standard & Poor's GSCI Index - have risen 6.3 per cent and 2.6 per cent respectively so far this year. Both delivered negative returns last year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

China had a public holiday on Monday. \"We were told we can't ship any material out while they do this investigation,\" a source at a trading house said.\n\nThe port of Qingdao is China's third-largest foreign trade port and the world's seventh-largest port, trading with 700 ports in more than 180 countries, according to its website.\n\n\"Banks are worried about their exposure,\" one warehousing source in Singapore said. \"There is a scramble for people to head down there at the minute and make sure that their metal that they think is covered by a warehouse receipt actually exists,\" he said.\n\nMetal imports have been partly driven in China as a means to raise finance, where traders can pledge metal as collateral to obtain better terms. In some cases, the same shipment can be pledged to more than one bank, fuelling hot-money inflows and spurring a clampdown by Chinese authorities.\n\n\"It appears there is a discrepancy in metal that should be there and metal that is actually there,\" said another source at a warehouse company with operations at the port. \"We hear the discrepancy is 80,000 tonnes of aluminium and 20,000 tonnes of copper, but we hear that the volumes will actually be higher. It's either missing or it was never there - there have been triple issuing of documentation.\"\n\nBeijing last year set new rules to curb currency speculation amid signs that hot-money inflows helped push the yuan to a series of record highs. The rules required banks to tighten the management of their foreign exchange lending and types of clients that are able to access those loans.\n\n\"It's such a massive port I would think virtually everybody has exposure,\" the trading source said. \"Once the investigation is over, it could be bearish for metals.

We will need to debate plans on an exit when our 2 per cent price target is achieved in a stable manner.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Masayoshi Amamiya, an architect of the BOJ's quantitative easing, was reappointed for a rare second term as executive director. He will oversee a key division charged with drafting monetary policy, Reuters reported the central bank as having said yesterday.\n\nMr Kuroda's bold support for continuing aggressive policies by the BOJ came on the heels of a report last week by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which warned Japan against relying too heavily on injections of financial liquidity to spur economic growth and boost inflation.\n\nThe Japanese central bank chief made it clear, however, in his comments to parliament that he expected Mr Abe's administration to come up with solid proposals for structural economic reform this month - the so-called \"third arrow\" of Abenomics.\n\n\"Japan's potential growth has fallen significantly. It is therefore very important to map out a growth strategy to boost its potential growth,\" he said. \"I would like to re-emphasise this point,\" he added.\n\nThe government must map out a credible growth strategy and boost the country's long-term growth potential, as improvements in the economy and an ageing population have led to labour shortages, said the BOJ chief.\n\nImprovements in the Japanese economy have boosted domestic demand and narrowed Japan's output gap to near zero, he noted. But increased domestic demand has thrown the spotlight on the need to address supply constraints that may limit long-term growth, he said.\n\nAn ageing population is leading to labour shortages, and prolonged deflation has forced companies to hold back on capital expenditure.\n\nOne of Mr Kuroda's deputy governors, Kikuo Iwata, joined him yesterday in sounding concerns about the dangers Japan could find itself stuck in if the government's growth strategy fails to pull the economy out of its low-growth, mild-inflation mode.\n\nMr Iwata also called for bold structural reforms, warning that without such efforts, Japan could suffer from low economic growth - even if the BOJ's price target were to be achieved.\n\nJapan's public pension fund, the world's biggest, could raise its investment in domestic stocks to 20 per cent of its portfolio from the current 12 per cent, a senior official of the fund was quoted as having said yesterday.\n\nYasuhiro Yonezawa, the recently appointed head of the investment committee of the US$1.26 trillion Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), said 20 per cent \"would not necessarily be too high a hurdle\" for the GPIF's weighting of Japanese stocks, the Nikkei financial daily reported.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's not even really a thump sort of a sound - it's more of a dull oomph,\" said Alec Duncan, a senior marine science research fellow at Curtin University near Perth, who has led the research.\n\n\"If you ask me what's the probability this is related to the flight, without the satellite data it's 25 or 30 per cent, but that's certainly worth taking a very close look at,\" Mr Duncan said.\n\nThe general vicinity from which the noise emanated is a large area of the central Indian Ocean off the southern tip of India and about 4,800 km north-west of Australia. But that is not consistent with calculations of an arc of possible locations in the south-eastern Indian Ocean where the plane, carrying 239 people, might have run out of fuel. Those calculations were from Inmarsat, the global satellite communications company, and scientists have struggled to figure out the origin of the noise.\n\nA very small section of the arc that was searched by a deep-sea submersible this spring, without success, was about 960 km off the Australian coast.\n\nEven without the Inmarsat data, there are other possible explanations for the noise besides an aircraft impact, Mr Duncan said. One would be a very small undersea earthquake that would produce a similar noise audible across great distances but not strong enough to show up on the nearest seismometers on land, which did not record a tremor at the time.\n\nThe direction from which the noise arrived does produce some small earthquakes every year, although there had not been one in the days preceding Flight 370's disappearance, Mr Duncan added.\n\nTwo receivers - one operated by Mr Duncan's team and the other by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization in Vienna - produced enough data to establish the direction from which the noise arrived. But the distance to the source of the noise was less clear. The result, according to Mr Duncan, is an area of ocean roughly the size of Texas.\n\nMark Prior, an acoustics specialist at the test ban organisation headquarters, said the sound might be consistent with an ocean impact or with some kind of a sealed, air-filled container that sank into the depths until the exterior water pressure caused it to crumple.\n\nMr Prior said that the sound might have been reflected off a seamount, or underwater mountain, before travelling to the two receivers, so the origin of the noise could have been somewhere else.\n\nThe Australian government has funded the research at Curtin University, and additional experts in Canberra, the country's capital, have also collaborated. The Australian authorities have been skeptical so far about ordering a new search thousands of miles away based on the noise.\n\nMartin Dolan, chief commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, said last week that search operations would continue to focus on the narrow arc defined by the Inmarsat calculations.\n\nMr Duncan and his team operate an undersea device off the coast of Perth that is mainly used to monitor the low-frequency cries of blue whales, the world's largest mammals and one of its most endangered species. The team's receiver, or hydrophone, records noises on an undersea data device, which is hauled up to the ocean surface every six months and its contents downloaded.\n\nThe team sailed out for an extra visit to pull up the recorder and recover the data after the search for Flight 370 shifted to the Indian Ocean. The noise was faint but detectable, prompting Mr Duncan to request and obtain the test ban treaty organisation's data for March 8 from its receiver off Cape Leeuwin, about 320 km to the south. The staff did not initially detect any noise, Mr Prior said, because it was using a high threshold for confirming a noise, based on its experience with underwater explosions. It checked the records of its other operating hydrophone in the Indian Ocean, near Diego Garcia, but the noise was not detected there.

March's orders were revised to show a 1.5 per cent increase instead of the previously reported 0.9 per cent rise.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast new orders received by factories gaining 0.5 per cent.\n\nManufacturing is growing after moderating a bit during a very cold winter. It is likely to continue expanding, with a survey on Monday showing new orders at the nation's factories at their highest level in five months in May.\n\nBusinesses are also starting to rebuild inventories after hunkering down in the first quarter as they worked through piles of stocks accumulated in the second half of 2013.\n\nThe factory orders report showed inventories rose 0.4 per cent in April, while shipments rose for a third consecutive month. The inventories-to-shipments ratio was unchanged at 1.30.\n\nOrders excluding the volatile transportation category increased 0.5 per cent in April as bookings for primary metals, electrical equipment, appliances and components and capital goods rose. That was the third straight month of gains.\n\nUnfilled orders at factories increased 0.9 per cent, the largest gain since November.

Shipowners ordered large numbers of vessels between 2007 and 2009, just as the global economy sank into crisis. Prospects have brightened in recent months as world trade picks up and the ship glut is absorbed.\n\nTriton, the world's largest container-leasing company, has held conversations with investment banks in recent weeks about an IPO in the United States of up to US$500 million that could come later this year, the people said on Monday.

Warburg Pincus and Vestar declined to comment, while Triton representatives did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFounded in 1980, Hamilton, Bermuda-based Triton has a roughly 15 per cent share of the global leased fleet market and a network of more than 200 independent depots, according to Warburg Pincus' website.\n\nWarburg Pincus and Vestar took a controlling stake in Triton in 2011 from the Pritzker family, one of the wealthiest in the US, in a deal that a source said at the time valued the company at about US$3.5 billion, including debt.\n\nIn April, PE firm Apollo Global Management LLC's Principal Maritime Tankers Corp, which owns tankers used to transport crude oil and petroleum products, filed for an IPO.\n\nNot all such IPOs have gone as planned.

Indeed, the long-running debate around Singapore's foreign worker policy has been one hot-button issue that is unlikely to go away anytime soon.\n\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made clear that the deferment will not affect the more critical or urgent projects such as the building of new HDB flats or expansion of the train network. But \"less urgent\" projects that \"can wait one or two years\" are being set aside. These include extensions to Gardens by the Bay, the new Science Centre, and some new ministry and statutory board offices. Deferring the projects will save Singapore some 20,000 to 30,000 foreign workers, in line with the tightening of inflows in the last few years amid the big move to restructure the economy towards productivity-driven growth. Notably, foreign labour inflows have slowed, but have not been frozen, with the numbers having almost halved since 2011. Excluding the construction sector, the pace of labour inflow is now just a quarter of that in 2011. This update of Singapore's labour inflows may - or may not - spell assurance for Singaporeans who have griped and groused about the surge in the number of foreigners in the city-state over the past decade; many probably still find the trains and the neighbourhood market and mall as crowded as ever, and still see a seeming predominance of foreigners among frontline service staff here.\n\nYet the big-picture numbers also say: $2 billion worth of projects are being shelved, which spells some infrastructure and jobs foregone, and in a different scenario could amount to some critical pump-priming for a slow economy. So some projects \"pay the price\" - in terms of delayed milestones, deferred expansion - for the efforts to manage the population numbers and keep socio-economic peace, but Singapore is fortunate that its economy is healthy enough to be able to afford putting off some infrastructure-building. And that's just the public sector. The impact of the foreign-manpower tightening on the private sector is not as easily quantified but the anecdotal evidence is plain enough: Small and medium enterprises are particularly hit in the clampdown on foreign hiring as typically it's tougher for them to attract enough locals to meet the hiring quotas. Many indeed have had to downsize, if not close shop altogether, or ship out of Singapore - all of which spells job losses.\n\nEven as firms and industry are being weaned off a reliance on \"cheap\" labour, the drive for a more productive workforce will remain a long-haul journey - there hasn't yet been a trend of rise in the productivity stats. Meanwhile, the economy will continue to see the trade-offs for the decision to slow down labour inflows.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Since then, the Environmental Advisory Group was set up by the ICAO Council, consisting of 17 members of the Council and the International Air Transport Association (Iata). ICAO is the United Nations' aviation body.\n\nA preliminary proposal, consisting of a global offsetting scheme, is being developed with an eye on presenting this to the 2016 ICAO Assembly. Other schemes which were initially considered include a global emissions trading scheme and an offsetting scheme with an additional tax.\n\n\"We believe (the global offsetting scheme) is the simplest way to move this forward,\" said Iata's vice-president Paul Steele at the 70th Iata Annual General Meeting in Doha. \"We're at early days, there's a lot of water that needs to flow under the bridge before we get to a final proposal that will go before the ICAO Assembly in 2016. I'm encouraged. I think things are moving in the right direction.\"\n\nBut technical and political hurdles remain, such as whether developing countries should be subject to the same standards.\n\nThe European Union hasn't helped matters either by trying to extend the EU emissions trading system (ETS) to all flights operating in European airspace - a watered down version of an earlier more stringent proposal - which would make these flights subject to an emissions tax. This was met with staunch opposition from countries and major aviation bodies alike, which have stressed that an international market-based measure would be preferable. Amid pressure from governments, the EU capitulated and ended up postponing the application of the scheme for international flights flying into or out of Europe.\n\nMeanwhile, airlines continue to invest in next-generation aircraft and more fuel-efficient engines to deliver lower fuel burn and reduce costs, which is also expected to help in the fight against carbon emissions.\n\n\"The industry is not sitting here waiting for governments to do anything. Fuel is 30 per cent of operating costs. If you're an airline today, you have to be efficient if you want to survive,\" emphasised Mr Steele, adding that the industry has been also calling on governments to improve airport operations to tackle congestion, which can result in increased fuel burn.\n\nIn the long term, the aviation industry is seeking to reduce carbon emissions by 2050 to about half of the levels seen in 2005.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But change is beginning to happen at a different level, in the undergrowth of the Japanese bureaucracy.\n\nAbenomics is not only about having the will to reform the world's third largest economy, nor indeed just about possessing the political power to do so. Critically, it is also about being able to ensure that legislated reforms are not neutralised by the powerful bureaucracy. The biggest resistance factor to change in Japan is not the public - be it \"conservative\" farmers or supposedly consensus-loving ordinary people who oppose interference with custom and tradition that is not preceded by years or decades of consultation. It is the bureaucracy or civil service.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe is not the first political leader to recognise this. Ichiro Ozawa, a former co-leader of the Democratic Party of Japan, which held office for three years before being swept out by Mr Abe's Liberal Democratic Party, was highly critical of Japanese bureaucrats. Mr Abe has created a sense of charisma that Mr Ozawa lacked and, with the benefit of high popularity ratings is able to be bolder in his attempts to lop away the undergrowth of bureaucratic regulation that prevents change in Japan.

At the same time, Swiss bankers have been lobbying against separate EU proposals to ban them from marketing their services directly to residents of the union from Switzerland.\n\nWhile some Swiss financial firms have opened banks or asset management companies in other European countries to target local markets, rich people still want to put some of their wealth in offshore jurisdictions to spread risk and invest in other currencies, Ms de Weck said.\n\nThe EU proposals come at a time when Switzerland is facing competition from Miami, London, Luxembourg, Hong Kong and Singapore to be the offshore booking centre of choice for affluent individuals and families.\n\nSwitzerland is losing its tradition of banking secrecy as countries prepare to implement new standards on automatic exchange of information between tax authorities as early as 2015.\n\nFor private banks in Geneva, the issue of cross-border marketing of services in Europe is the most important regulatory matter facing the industry, said Ms de Weck, describing European clients as Geneva's \"domestic base\" of customers.\n\nThese are \"clients we have had for over 200 years so obviously we are very keen to serve them\", she said.\n\nWhile Swiss bankers can't cross the border into places such as neighbouring France to meet clients or try to develop new business there, competitors in London or Luxembourg would be able to visit EU customers under the proposed rules, according to Ms de Weck.\n\nSwiss banks may need to relocate thousands of jobs to new branches or subsidiaries in EU countries to be able to service wealthy people in those countries, the Swiss Bankers Association has said.\n\nEstablished in Geneva in 1796, Lombard Odier has offices in some EU countries, including the UK, France and Germany. The bank has no plans to acquire businesses in EU countries to compensate for the loss of private-client services from Geneva, Ms de Weck said, speaking on the sidelines of the conference. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": []}

Real estate values in Dubai, home to the world's tallest skyscraper and one of the biggest shopping malls, increased at the fastest pace in the world in 2013, while bank lending growth accelerated to the quickest in five years.\n\n\"You can see in terms of business practices that things aren't as hairy as they were in 2008,\" Raj Madha, an independent regional banking analyst, said on Sunday. Back then \"people were selling buildings, then looking for ways to build those buildings\". \"We haven't seen that come back yet,\" he said.\n\nBorrowing costs in the UAE have tumbled, with the yield on Emaar's Islamic bond due 2019 falling 103 basis points this year to 3.52 per cent yesterday at 12.29pm in Dubai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a 56 basis-point drop to 4.04 per cent for Middle East bonds, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co indices.\n\nIn Dubai, real estate prices increased 35 per cent last year, the biggest jump globally, according to Knight Frank.

Mr Wagar believes that US businesses can serve as a \"force multiplier\" for American foreign policy.\n\nHe made the comments at the official opening of the inaugural US pavilion yesterday at the Water Expo, held at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre.\n\nThis is the first time the US is having a dedicated pavilion at the biennial event, as a result of a partnership between the US Department of Commerce, the US Embassy in Singapore, the American Water Works Association and trade show organiser Kallman Worldwide.\n\n\"I think this is really indicative of American businesses at large, and they are really seeing the opportunities that Asean can bring for them,\" Mr Wagar told The Business Times after touring the pavilion.\n\nThe pavilion is home to 25 exhibitors. Another 32 are scattered across the Expo, including household names such as General Electric. They hail from 12 different states such as Illinois, Florida, California and Colorado.\n\nUS Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce Chandra Brown, who is in town for her first official visit to Singapore, was also present at the pavilion's opening ceremony.\n\nIn her remarks, she described the water sector as a critical industry for both the US and Singapore, and this was a key reason why the US is keen to increase and develop the relationship between the two countries.\n\nWriting in the official guide to the US Pavilion, President Barack Obama said that the business relationships developed at the trade show would help increase economic growth and create jobs throughout the US.\n\n\"By opening new markets and promoting trade, we are creating new sales channels for US products and services,\" he said.\n\nThis year's SIWW is also special for the US, with the Orange County Water District in California awarded the prestigious Lee Kuan Yew Water Prize for its pioneering work in groundwater management and water reclamation using advanced water reuse technologies.\n\nThe Water Prize is one of two top honours given out at the SIWW and the concurrent World Cities Summit.\n\nThe other award, the City Prize, went to the Chinese city of Suzhou for its demonstration of sound planning principles and good urban management.\n\nBoth prizes were handed out last night during a dinner event at the Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore that was graced by President Tony Tan Keng Yam.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

First, Islamic finance has grown at double digits last year, as it has for the previous five years, despite global economic uncertainties and market volatility. Global Islamic financial assets are estimated to have reached US$1.8 trillion by the end of last year, from US$1.5 trillion in 2012.\n\nSecond, global regulatory standards and best practices are being established for Islamic finance. Common standards are good for facilitating cross-border transactions, helping to address risks that are idiosyncratic to Islamic finance, such as Syariah non-compliance risk, he noted.\n\nThird, more countries are catering to Islamic finance.\n\nIn Asia, Indonesia has set out to significantly grow its Islamic banking sector and develop its Islamic capital markets. India started introducing Islamic financial products and services last year.\n\nThere is growing cross-border sukuk or Islamic bonds issuance within Asia as well as between the Middle East and Asia.\n\n\"Singapore has benefited from this favourable global environment for Islamic finance,\" he said.\n\nSingapore is the only non-Muslim-majority country among the top 15 countries for Islamic finance. Islamic assets under management have surged nearly fourfold over the last five years to US$3.5 billion in 2012. More than 40 per cent of the Islamic assets in Singapore are managed by the asset management industry.\n\nFifteen banks are involved in Islamic banking, double the number five years ago; they hold about a third of the Islamic assets in Singapore. The rest of Islamic assets are in outstanding sukuk and takaful or Islamic insurance.\n\nSingapore has had nearly 30 sukuk issuances worth S$4.3 billion to-date, compared to seven in 2013.\n\nAnd more funds continue to be established here, to meet demand from clients in Asia as well as from the Middle East. Several corporations have established sukuk programmes in Singapore to tap the market over the next few years, said Mr Menon.\n\nStill, despite the impressive growth, industry players say Islamic finance here needs more depth - in a non-Muslim-majority environment, Islamic finance has yet to really take off.\n\nMost Islamic banks tend to be retail-heavy, as seen in the more than 60 per cent retail weightage in Malaysia and 80 per cent in Indonesia, noted Syed Abdull Aziz Syed Kechik, OCBC Al-Amin Bank Berhad chief executive.\n\n\"This is invariably linked to a domestic centrism,\" he said.\n\n\"While organic growth remains a reality, the gap between Islamic banks on one side and conventional regional and global players on the other is widening. Bolder moves by Islamic banking players to expand via regional mergers and acquisitions would be the key to fast-tracking capacity and building scope,\" he said.\n\nOther challenges include the lack of familiarity with Syariah structures, with Middle East investors and companies venturing offshore heading mainly to London.\n\nAccording to Clifford Lee, DBS Bank's head of fixed income, much education still needs to be done on structuring Syariah-compliant deals.\n\n\"In the last 12 months, people I've spoken to say Islamic financing of a plane can't be done because it serves alcohol onboard; oddly enough, it could be done for the engine,\" said Mr Lee.\n\nAs for sukuk issuances in Singapore, companies which have done so in order to broaden their investor base have found that the benefits of diversification weren't obvious.\n\n\"Just making a bond Syariah-compliant does not mean there are investors tripping over themselves to get it,\" pointed out Mr Lee. Funds in the region may not also have the mandates to invest in these products.\n\nAs commercially driven entities, most banks would be wary of the added cost from ever-increasing regulatory requirements when investing capital into a nascent market that currently offers low prospects and has limited governmental support, said OCBC Al-Amin's Syed Abdull Aziz.\n\nHe suggested the government could do more to promote the sector. The government could consider the merits of developing a strategic plan with appropriate incentives for the key industry stakeholders, he said.\n\n\"This would help to nurture a comprehensive sizeable Islamic finance sector in Singapore, taking into consideration the long-term benefits of active participation in the Islamic finance channel within the context of the overall Asean integrated economic growth framework,\" said Syed Abdull Aziz.\n\nYeo Wico, Allen & Gledhill LLP partner, noted that due to the efforts of Singapore's regulators, there is a level playing field between Islamic finance and conventional finance.\n\n\"Singapore's attraction as an international finance centre in an economically vibrant region is key to the future growth of Islamic finance in Singapore,\" said Mr Yeo.\n\nThe Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region is transforming rapidly and Singapore companies should also seize opportunities there, said Zainul Abidin Rasheed, Singapore Ambassador to Kuwait and Foreign Minister's Special Envoy to the Middle East. The GCC comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nMany may not be aware of the strong development and growth phase that the GCC is experiencing now. \"The main cities of the GCC will be transformed, and Singapore should be part of this transformation,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This service lets consumers store information from various kinds of cards, including credit and debit, issued by participating banks in \"digital wallets\".\n\nAfter the initial set-up, shoppers will bypass the rigamarole of entering their 16-digit card number along with details like mailing address and shipping information each time they buy something from a merchant that offers the MasterPass payment option.\n\n\"Research shows that consumers prefer to see their financial information stored in wallets from their (card) issuers, because the issuers are whom they trust their money with. MasterPass supports wallets launched from financial institutions ... and that's a key difference,\" said Raj Dhamodharan, MasterCard's group head, emerging payments, Asia Pacific.\n\nSo far, DBS Bank, Maybank and OCBC Bank have come onboard, issuing wallets with MasterPass. CIMB Bank is slated to roll out its wallet soon, while UOB should join the platform within the year.\n\nIn Singapore, the first country in South-east Asia to launch MasterPass, more than 250 merchants currently offer the MasterPass check-out option online, including Shaw Theatres, Sistic and beauty product retailer Luxola.\n\nGlobally, more than 40,000 merchants have come onboard with the service that was first launched in February last year. It is currently available in the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Italy and China.\n\nAs the demand for online and mobile shopping has grown, so too has the need for less-cumbersome ways to make payment, especially on mobile devices with small screens.\n\nCiting research that MasterCard carried out, Julienne Loh, general manager, MasterCard Singapore, said: \"Eighty-five per cent of consumers said that multiple-payment platforms are confusing. They've got different experiences with different merchants. They just want one simple experience.\"\n\nEventually, MasterPass will extend its reach into offline shopping in stores, through the use of Near-Field Communication or contactless technology and QR codes.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That's the third monthly decline after they reached a six-year high in January. Today's report also showed continued weakness in business lending, which fell \u00a32.4 billion (S$5 billion) in April.\n\nBanks have toughened criteria in recent months and new rules came into force in April requiring borrowers to prove that they can afford repayments even when interest rates rise. Yesterday's report adds to signs of a possible easing in the housing market as BOE financial stability officials prepare to meet this month to decide if they need to take action to cool property growth.\n\nThe decline in approvals in April was more than forecast by economists, who had projected a reading of 64,500.\n\nThe BOE data showed that net mortgage lending rose by \u00a31.7 billion in April from March. Demand for property has been partly boosted by low borrowing costs, with the effective interest rate on secured loans dropping to 3.23 per cent in April, the lowest since the series began in 1999.\n\nIn the minutes of their May meeting, the BOE's Monetary Policy Committee noted the slowdown in the property market, which they said was taking place \"in the context of continuing buoyancy in house prices\". They said that it wasn't yet clear if this was a temporary response to the Mortgage Market Review.\n\nThe credit data showed that business loans fell 4.1 per cent in April from a year earlier. Lending to small and medium-sized companies dropped 3 per cent on the year.\n\nIt also showed that consumer credit rose \u00a3666 million in April, with credit cards accounting for \u00a3435 million of that increase. M4, a broad measure of money supply, slipped 0.2 per cent in April from March and was down 0.6 per cent from a year earlier. An underlying measure rose 4.5 per cent on a three-month annualised basis, an acceleration from 3.4 per cent.\n\nForeign investors sold a net \u00a33.2 billion of gilts in March, the central bank said.

Singapore also scored as the top Asian city.\n\nThe study which analyses the development of 30 global cities gauges their performance over a variety of indicators.\n\nSingapore was tops for two of the 10 indicators used to assess performance - ease of doing business, and transportation and infrastructure.\n\nOther indicators include technology readiness, demographics and livability, cost, and intellectual capital and innovation.\n\nEach indicator is further made up of a range of more specific variables. For example, Singapore's top ranking for ease of doing business comprises a similar top ranking for three of the eight variables involved.\n\nSingapore's leap up the rankings did not happen by chance, said Yee Chen Fah, who leads PwC Singapore's government and public services practice and is an audit partner in the assurance division.\n\n\"Singapore has always been at the forefront of coming up with policies and the improvement has a lot to do with forward planning. City planning is very important - there is only so much space that we have in Singapore, and we have to decide where to build what,\" Mr Yee told BT.\n\nHe emphasised the continued importance of forward planning, especially with regard to some of the indicators where Singapore performed less well.\n\n\"We need to ensure that our environment remains conducive to doing business, and the costs of operating and living in Singapore are things we constantly have to grapple with,\" Mr Yee said.\n\nThis attitude of not resting on one's laurels was noted by Hazem Galal, PwC's global leader for cities and local government networks, as one of the reasons for Singapore's success as a city.\n\n\"What's important about the Singaporean way of thinking is that there is a culture of continuous learning and improvement,\" said Mr Galal, who was in the team that produced the report.\n\n\"There's never a sense of 'we've reached the top and we're okay now'. When I encounter Singaporean delegations on my travels I see that they can always find one or two things to learn from anyone.\"\n\nMr Galal added that socioeconomic balance is key to any city's success, citing New York as the best example of a city that performed well consistently across most indicators. New York was ranked second in the study despite not finishing first for any of the indicators.\n\nThe 30 cities analysed in the study were selected to be geographically representative and to ensure a good mix of cities from emerging and developed countries.\n\nThey also have to be global or regional capitals of business, finance or culture.\n\nThe full report can be accessed at\n\nwww.pwc.com/cities\n\n.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Ministry of Trade and Industry noted that Singapore's economic growth slowed from 6.9 per cent in Q4 2013 to 2.3 per cent in Q1 2014 on a quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q), seasonally adjusted, annualised basis.\n\nJust as late payments went up in number, the overall number of prompt payments q-o-q came down - from 57.73 per cent to 51.92 per cent, the SCCB said.\n\nThis is the first decline since Q2 2013, when the proportion of prompt payments dipped below the 50 per cent mark to 46.77 per cent.\n\nPrompt payments are defined as a situation in which 90 per cent of bills are paid within 30 days; payments are considered slow when more than half the bills are paid more than 30 days late.\n\nAs their cash flow deteriorates, more companies are offering partial payments. These went up marginally to 10.2 per cent from 9.43 per cent in Q4.\n\nPartial payments have been on a steady rise, reversing a downward trend a year ago; in Q1 2013, partial payments made up a mere 6.12 per cent.\n\nSectorally, an increase in slow payments was experienced in four out of five industries in Q1 this year - a vastly different picture from the preceding quarter, when only one in five industries recorded growth in slow payments.\n\nDBS economist Irwin Seah said that attention should be paid to the weakness in the construction sector; it is not a big part of the economy but its weakness nevertheless reflects risks down the road. \"It does suggest companies may be facing liquidity tightness. There's downsizing to their revenue inflows and cost is eroding their profit margins.\"\n\nProperty transactions have fallen, and with developers unable to sell their projects, they become unable to pay contractors, who in turn delay settling their bills with others in the supply chain, he said.\n\n\"We need to be watchful of the impact. It's all connected.\"\n\nHe also noted that domestic debt is rising rapidly and may soon reach the historical loan-to-deposit ratio peak of 117 during the 1997/8 Asian financial crisis. Based on the latest official data, the ratio is 108, up from 100 in June last year, he said.\n\nOCBC economist Selena Ling said that slower payments are to be expected amid a slower pipeline of construction projects awarded (-10.8 per cent q-o-q in the first quarter of 2014). In particular, private-sector construction activity has moderated along with a pullback in market sentiment; transaction volumes have eased and private home sales have fallen.\n\nShe said: \"In addition, there are also the supply- side constraints in terms of the foreign manpower crunch, and the government recently announced its decision to defer $2 billion of public infrastructure projects.\"\n\nHowever, she cautioned against reading too much into one quarter of deterioration. \"There is no need to over-react at this juncture, but just be mindful to watch for further material deterioration that stretches beyond one to two quarters and/or if the percentage of slow payments overtakes that of prompt payments.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That's the highest-ever asking price for a condominium in downtown Manhattan, according to Jonathan Miller, president of appraiser Miller Samuel.\n\n\"The price is more reflective of the unique historical nature of the property\" than its location or the heated luxury market, Mr Miller said. \"We've seen rapid absorption downtown, but this project is unlike anything that's come online.\"\n\nThe upper floors of the building at 233 Broadway, with its neo-Gothic spire rising above City Hall, are being converted into 34 luxury apartments with prices rivalling those at Midtown skyscrapers fringing Central Park. The tower, designed by Cass Gilbert for five-and-dime-store pioneer Frank Woolworth, was completed in 1913. At 241 metres, it was the world's tallest skyscraper until 1930.\n\nPlans call for \"spacious, super high-end homes\" with ceiling heights of three to four metres on average, according to a statement by developer Alchemy Properties in 2012, when it led an investor group that bought the top 30 storeys of the office building. Residents would have a separate lobby and lifts, according to the statement.\n\nSales are scheduled to begin in the fall, with buyers moving into apartments in 2016, according to Kenneth Horn, president of Alchemy Properties. The developer is incorporating the architectural integrity of the tower, designated a national historic landmark in 1966, into the design for the residences, he said.\n\n\"There is nothing like the Woolworth Building in the entire world,\" Mr Horn said. \"It is an iconic landmark and it cannot be duplicated.\"\n\nPrices for the condos start at US$3.5 million for a 112-square-metre unit on the 44th floor, according to the proposed offering plan, which is under review by the attorney general's office. Three units in addition to the penthouse are listed at more than US$20 million, including a 6,084-square-foot full-floor apartment with a terrace on the 31st storey for US$24 million.\n\nThe US$110 million penthouse is about 8,975 square feet with a 584-square-foot terrace. The four-bedroom condo with a private lift spans nine storeys, with the primary living space on the 50th and 51st floors, according to the offering plan. A great room and wine cellar make up the 53rd floor, and the 55th through 58th levels in the cupola include a library or media room and an observation deck at the top, the plan shows.\n\n\"It's being priced consistent with top-of-the-line units in Midtown,\" said Mr Miller, whose firm is based in New York. \"This will be the first at this price point downtown, so it's not clear whether the market will support it.\"\n\nThe Woolworth Building penthouse isn't the most expensive new condo listing in Manhattan's history. Two units at Extell Development's One57 were once priced at US$115 million. Penthouses at One57 and Harry Macklowe and CIM Group's 432 Park Ave are under contract for more than US$90 million, a record for Manhattan.\n\nThose projects, both skyscrapers with views of Central Park, have been marketed towards ultra-wealthy investors seeking New York real estate as a haven. The developers have touted their sales to buyers from around the world, including South America, the Middle East, China and Russia.\n\nThe price record for downtown was set in January with the US$50.9 million purchase of a 5,955-square-foot full-floor penthouse at the Walker Tower in Chelsea.\n\n\"Downtown, the challenge is you tend to have less interest from foreign buyers,\" Mr Miller said. \"In the last development boom, in the last three years, they've concentrated more in Midtown or in the Upper East and West sides, near the central business district.\"\n\nDevelopers asking more than US$100 million for apartments are going after billionaires, and \"that's a small market to target\", said Donna Olshan, president of Olshan Realty and author of a weekly newsletter on the New York luxury market.\n\nOn a per-square-foot basis, the asking price for the Woolworth penthouse is more than triple the average for new luxury condos downtown, which is US$3,000, she said. \"This is fantasy pricing and you cannot trick the market,\" Ms Olshan said. \"They would have to demonstrate why this is the most unusual property ever seen downtown.\"\n\nDemand for condos in the area has soared. Contracts signed at newly built properties between 34th Street and the Financial District almost doubled last year to 1,222, according to brokerage Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group. Buyers agreed to pay an average of US$5.7 million in the fourth quarter, up 49 per cent from a year earlier and a record. The price per square foot of those deals rose 20 per cent to a high of US$2,915.\n\nDevelopers downtown have more than 4,000 units planned for construction or delivery within the next two years. Projects such as the planned conversion of a Verizon Communications Inc office building in Tribeca and Greenwich Lane, a complex under construction at the site of the shuttered St Vincent's Hospital, are aimed at local buyers with prices starting at about US$2 million.\n\nAt 56 Leonard, a planned 60-storey tower in southern Tribeca, a 7,800-square-foot penthouse sold for US$47 million.\n\n\"Downtown has been the hottest market the last couple of years,\" Ms Olshan said. \"Nothing has been hotter.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

OCBC said that the likes of Keppel Corporation (Keppel) and Sembcorp Marine (Sembmarine) are poised to benefit as national companies, and notably Brazil's Petrobras and Mexico's Pemex, feature on their customer lists.\n\nOCBC noted that most offshore support vessel companies are discussing strategies to navigate environments with local content requirements and cabotage laws. There is also a trend of Singapore-based fleet owners turning to partnerships to penetrate the increasingly-closed Indonesian market. This is especially since both Malaysia and Indonesia are tightening their cabotage laws to further protect their domestic industries.\n\nOnly the likes of Ezra Holdings and Swiber Holdings, which operate in the more specialised areas of offshore construction and subsea operations, are able to circumvent local content restrictions, mainly because of domestic shortage of such assets and service providers.\n\nHowever, OCBC also cautioned investors against simply jumping into companies just because they have exposure to certain coveted markets, as the high-cost sectors, like the deepwater rig market, are weakening with softening rates and declining utilisation. On the contrary, the jack-up rig market remains strong as oil companies still require short to medium-term production for cash flows, where utilitisation levels are above 98 per cent.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, OCBC has picked Keppel for its \"near market, near customer\" strategy, which puts it in good stead to secure more orders, while it also highlighted that Nam Cheong's significant exposure to the Malaysian market and established relationships with its customers position it well to obtain more orders too. Others among its preferred picks include Pacific Radiance, which has considerable exposure to the Indonesian market, and Ezion Holdings, for operating in niche areas with a positive outlook.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Transaero has also ordered the plane.\n\nThe 747-8 is also produced as a freighter. Last year Boeing sold 17 747-8s altogether, and the planemaker is producing 18 a year, a rate it aims to maintain, Mr Wojick said.\n\nBoeing had to slow production last year amid waning demand, cutting the rate to 1.5 planes a month.\n\nBoeing remains confident about keeping up a steady stream of orders for the current-generation 777 planes, Mr Wojick said, even as the manufacturer is poised to bring a new 777X into commercial service in 2020.\n\nThe planemaker is seeking to pair sales of new-design 777X models with current-generation 777-300s, and will in some cases help encourage orders by agreeing to take from airlines older aircraft, including the Boeing 777-200 and also Airbus' four-engine A340-600, now out of production, he said.\n\n\"We have six years to get to the 777x so we've got another three years backlog to fill,\" Mr Wojick said. \"I think it's a doable task.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Under the conditional sale-and-purchase agreement, HanKore will pay for the acquisition with the issuance of 1.94 billion new shares.\n\nNews of the potential RTO first became known in December, driving HanKore shares to an all-time closing high of $1.48 in March, before they tumbled last month on news that the target's parent, China Everbright group, had been implicated in corruption investigations in China. The stock has since recovered and closed at $1.19 last Friday before yesterday's trading halt.\n\nExplaining the rationale of the deal, HanKore said yesterday that the proposed acquisition will \"significantly increase the scale of the company's operations and make it one of the largest water treatment companies in the PRC\".\n\nThe deal will also enhance its financial strength, and raise its competitiveness when bidding for public tenders. This will better position the company to pursue further acquisitions, take on larger projects and attract strategic partners, HanKore said.\n\nWhen the deal is completed, HanKore will own 32 wastewater treatment plants with a designed capacity of 3.4 million tonnes per day and four reusable water projects with a designed capacity of 62,000 tonnes per day.\n\nIt will also own a waste-water source heat pump project servicing an area of 125,000 sq m, two completed build-transfer projects, a 56km pipeline network and 10 pump stations.

Fifty is the dividing line between growth and contraction.\n\nThe median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a gain to 55.5.\n\nSome companies may be waiting for more evidence of a pick-up in sales before they add new equipment and expand capacity. At the same time, steady demand for vehicles and the need to replace ageing machinery will help keep investment from faltering and benefit manufacturers such as Cisco Systems Inc and Whirlpool Corp.\n\n\"The overall trend in manufacturing is still respectable though not particularly strong,\" David Sloan, a senior economist at 4cast Inc in New York, said before the report. \"It's consistent with the rest of the economy, with the April numbers showing that the momentum didn't continue into this quarter as much as people expected.\"\n\nManufacturing accounts for about 12 per cent of the economy.\n\nThe index of production decreased to a three-month low of 55.2 from 55.7 the prior month. The new orders measure fell to 53.3, the lowest in four months, from 55.1.\n\nThe employment gauge decreased to 51.9 from 54.7.

The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey calls for a 16.1 million pace, up from 16 million a month earlier. Purchases climbed in April and March for the best back-to-back monthly gains since 2007, according to Ward's Automotive Group.\n\nThe housing recovery also is helping manufacturers as it generates sales of building equipment to appliances such as washers and cooking ranges.\n\nWhirlpool, based in Benton Harbor, Michigan, is among businesses that are upbeat.\n\n\"We are, I would say, still in the early stages of a rebound in the housing market,\" chief financial officer Larry Venturelli said at a May 14 homebuilding conference.\n\nMeanwhile, other factory reports from around the world were mixed.

The deal is downsized from the $582.3 million agreed last year.\n\nAs part of the transaction, W Corp will first undertake a share consolidation to consolidate every 10 existing shares into one share. It will then issue 490.9 million new consolidated shares to YuuZoo shareholders as payment for the acquisition. The transaction hence constitutes a reverse takeover (RTO).\n\nW Corp will soon convene a special general meeting to obtain shareholders' approval for the proposed RTO and related proposals.\n\nYuuZoo was founded in 2008 by its chairman and CEO, Thomas Zilliacus, formerly the regional director and president of Nokia. The company builds targeted social e-commerce networks that bring consumers with common interests, locations or age groups together.\n\nUsers can buy content, services or merchandise that are directly related to the theme of the network. YuuZoo also provides turnkey solutions for businesses to build and operate their own networks and to monetise the activities on it.\n\nYuuZoo posted an unaudited profit of US$6.55 million on turnover of US$27.74 million in the financial year ended Dec 31, 2012, with a 37 million-strong user base.\n\nOver the last few months, it has signed agreements to allow its franchisees the exclusive rights to operate in 66 countries. It has also engaged new resellers in 16 markets, inked over 80 new network development contracts and widened its payment merchant base with over 30 new contracts inked.\n\nThis RTO is said to be strategic because of YuuZoo's intentions to expand in Asia. Though headquartered in Singapore, YuuZoo has been largely unheard of locally and its largest active user base is in Australia.\n\nW Corp was added to the SGX watch-list of loss-making companies in March after marking three consecutive years of pre-tax losses.\n\nSince it disposed of its original equipment manufacturing (OEM) and digital media products business in 2012, W Corp has been involved in the trading of solar grade silica, silicon metal and light-emitting diode components.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But a lack of financial resources constrains a city's ability to invest in its transport network.\n\nIt said that The Mobile Opportunity is unique in seeking to put an economic value on the cost of inefficient transport, thus helping cities make the case for investment.\n\nSome of the factors considered were journey times, crowding and network density, all of which impact a city's productivity. In order to have a reasonable comparison, the study groups cities into three categories to account for different levels of wealth and development.\n\nCopenhagen in Denmark is the most cost-efficient in the \"Well-established cities\" category, while Santiago, Chile tops \"Emerging cities\".\n\nSingapore, meanwhile, is the best in class city for \"High-density compact centres\", with a high-capacity system that is able to meet demand with minimal crowding and high levels of user functionality. Thus, the Republic is able to cope with future growth.\n\nSingapore is also praised for its long-term planning, helped by highly integrated governance; reliability and punctuality levels; and provision of air-conditioning on almost all of its public transport vehicles.\n\nAs the world leader in its sector, Singapore's only immediate weakness is a relatively low network density which leaves some areas poorly connected.\n\nBut according to the study, long-term development plans and continuous investment to maintain the existing high standards are all that is required for it to retain its position.\n\nThe study found that if all the 35 cities examined implemented relative \"best in class\" standards, they stand to gain an economic benefit of up to US$238 billion annually by 2030. Singapore's economic opportunity is pegged at $1.2 billion.\n\nExtrapolating to all comparably-sized cities globally with a population of around 750,000 and greater, it said that this suggests an economic opportunity of roughly US$800 billion annually, or about one per cent of global GDP. Today, the potential benefit would be about US$360 billion per year.\n\n\"All cities can learn from the leading cities in their category in order to close the gap of their transport networks' efficiency, reduce costs and increase productivity,\" said Credo partner Chris Molloy. \"Because the more efficient a city's transport network is, the more attractive the city is to business and people.\"\n\nRoland Busch, CEO of Siemens Sector Infrastructure & Cities, added that \"the best transportation systems are the ones that move people quickly, easily and comfortably to their destination\", with a clear strategy of how to meet future needs.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It could very well involve a mixed development. What we can build there is very exciting,\" said Mr Lock, who is quick to add that nothing is firm as yet.\n\nBillionaire Mr Lim, which is Rowsley's largest shareholder, will reportedly pump in 170 million euros (S$290.7 million) to complete work on Valencia's new stadium by 2019.\n\n\"With so many architects and engineers, we can certainly provide support. We also have an office in London that can support any work we do in Spain,\" said Mr Lock, who was formerly CEO of CapitaMall Asia (China).\n\nEven as the real estate firm eyes a shot at the Spanish post, it is keeping a hawk eye at the property market closer to home, across the causeway, to time the launch of its much-awaited Vantage Bay in Malaysia's bustling Iskandar.\n\nThe project, which spans 9.23 hectares, just received a key regulatory nod for its first residential development Skies, a two 75-storey tower project in Johor Baru city centre which will boast an unmatched view.\n\nVantage Bay is nearly ready for launch, but there are market-driven hurdles. Owing to recent property curbs on foreign buyers in Malaysia and a deluge of supply in the residential space, Iskandar's much-touted red hot zone has somewhat lost its sheen as buyers take a wait-and-see attitude.\n\nIt is this and expectations of softening property prices that Rowsley is closely monitoring.\n\n\"There are some concerns in the current climate where the signals appear mixed and buyers are more cautious.\n\n\"We can launch and will be able to sell our quality product in a bad or good market but of course, we want to sell it at a price that can maximise returns to shareholders,\" said Mr Lock.\n\nBelievers of Rowsley's turnaround can't wait either. The launch of the grand $2.2 billion project, another linchpin in the firm's transformation which was put together last September, is likely to further boost the firm's earnings prospects.\n\nRowsley shares closed trading yesterday unchanged at 28.5 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The election of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio who had pledged to apply progressive ideas during his term in office, and the political surge of Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a long-time opponent of Wall Street who may challenge Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, suggest that the party is starting to move to the political left.\n\nProgressive pundits have embraced some of the ideas promoted by French economist Thomas Piketty in his recently published Capital in the Twenty-First Century which details the rising income inequality, and Democratic politicians are calling for legislation to raise the minimum wage. That the political pendulum among Democrats is now swinging to the political left is not surprising. The financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession have made it more acceptable to challenge the prevailing free-market principles and give momentum to political activists who want to transform the Democratic Party into an unabashed champion of social-democratic policy ideas.\n\nBut what is surprising is the extent to which opposition to liberalising trade has also become a major component of the re-energised progressive agenda. Indeed, left-leaning lawmakers have been among the strongest opponents of extending the trade promotion authority aka \"fast track\" to US President Barack Obama, thus making it more difficult for him to get free-trade agreements with the Pacific and Atlantic economies off the ground.\n\nThis opposition to free trade is driven in part by pressure from some labour unions and economists who blame competition from emerging markets for the decline in American manufacturing. The role of automation and the rise of new technologies in the shrinking of the industrial base get little attention.\n\nHowever, the expansion in international trade and the growth in American exports during most of the 20th century have played a critical role in the creation of new American jobs and in the rise of the United States as a global economic power. That explains why progressive Democratic presidents like Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy were ardent free traders, while protectionism has traditionally been associated with the Republican Party's reactionary wing. Progressives should champion the need to open new global markets for American products and to make American labour more competitive. And they should give the green light to Mr Obama to conclude trade agreements which would help achieve these goals.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

As prices dropped, he overcame the impulse to flee with the rest of the herd and, instead, bought more corporate bonds, Bloomberg Pursuits will report in its Summer 2014 issue.\n\nAfter two decades as a trader, Mr Ford credits his serenity to experience - and to the 20 minutes he spends in his pyjamas each morning repeating a meaningless mantra bestowed on him by a teacher of Transcendental Meditation (TM) two years ago.\n\n\"I react to volatile markets much more calmly now,\" says Mr Ford, 48. \"I have more patience.\"\n\nHe also has more money. Latigo Partners LP, his event-driven credit fund, climbed 24 per cent last year. He almost beat the surging stock market with a bond fund.\n\nMr Ford is part of a growing number of Wall Street traders, including A-list hedge fund managers Ray Dalio, Paul Tudor Jones and Michael Novogratz, who are fine-tuning their brains - and upping their games - with meditation.\n\nBillionaire investor Daniel Loeb, who once likened a chief executive officer to a drug addict during one of his frequent public rants, in February praised meditation while sharing a stage with the Dalai Lama in Washington, DC.\n\nThe idea that Type A traders are seeking profit with the same tool that Buddhist monks use to achieve enlightenment might seem like sacrilege.\n\nYet most people misunderstand meditation, says Jay Michaelson, author of Evolving Dharma: Meditation, Buddhism, and the Next Generation of Enlightenment.\n\n\"Meditation used to have this reputation as a hippie thing for people who speak in a particularly soft tone of voice,\" Michaelson says.\n\nNot so.\n\n\"Samurai practised meditation to become more effective killers,\" he says. So too did kamikaze pilots. \"It's value-neutral,\" Michaelson says.\n\nTwinge in the gut\n\nWorkers at Goldman Sachs Group are folding into the lotus position in droves, says Elizabeth Sudler, an instructor the firm retains.\n\nClasses where students breathe and monitor their wandering minds have waiting lists several hundred long, Goldman spokesman David Wells says.\n\nOne trader there gets a twinge in his gut when he senses a move in the markets, Ms Sudler says. Meditating gives him an edge, he told her, by tuning into that sensation more reliably. Others report downshifting more easily after work and sleeping better at night.\n\n\"Goldman employees are under a lot of pressure to produce,\" Ms Sudler says. \"No one wants to be left behind.\"\n\nMeditation is going mainstream in part because science is substantiating what heretofore had been taken on faith.\n\nUp until 1983, only three peer-reviewed studies on meditation had ever been published, Michaelson says.\n\nBy last year, there were more than 1,300 studies showing an almost absurd number of benefits, from alleviating anxiety, depression and insomnia to reducing heart disease and speeding recovery from psoriasis, a skin disease.\n\nA 2005 study published by Harvard Medical School neuroscientist Sara Lazar showed that meditating enhances the prefrontal cortex, likely creating more connections between neurons and enlarging blood vessels.\n\nAmong various functions, the prefrontal cortex processes sensory information, handles rational decisions and regulates the amygdala, the structure that feeds our fight-or- flight instinct. A tame amygdala may be why David Ford bought bonds amid the panic - a prescient move as markets rebounded.\n\nMichaelson calls meditation \"brain hacking\", because it exploits the elastic nature of our grey matter, altering its make-up, as Ms Lazar and other scientists have proved.\n\nAs such, it may be the ultimate disruptive technology, he says.\n\nThat kind of talk gets the attention of traders, says Jeff Walker, former head of JPMorgan Chase & Co's private-equity unit and a long-time meditator. \"These guys are saying, 'there's an edge here that I need',\" Mr Walker says.\n\nHumans have been meditating in some form for millennia. Hindu texts from 1500 BC describe the practice, which hit the big time when a Hindu prince named Siddhartha Gautama became disenchanted with the empty opulence of the day and took up residence beneath a fig tree to contemplate the causes of human suffering. (Hint: Desire is a key culprit.)\n\nThrough the teachings of Siddhartha - who sat down a prince and, after 49 days, arose the Buddha - mindful meditation radiated out into the world.\n\nThere are many forms of meditation. Vipassana, for example, starts with concentrating on one thing, such as the breath. If a dog barks, you might register it before quickly refocusing on inhaling and exhaling.\n\nMental intrusions are treated the same way: thoughts such as \"book NetJets\" or \"offload bitcoins\" quickly pass like leaves floating on a stream.\n\nJon Kabat-Zinn, founding executive director of the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, defines mindfulness as \"paying attention in a particular way, on purpose, in the present moment and non-judgmentally\".\n\nThe aim is to become more aware of the present and avoid getting hijacked by the past or the future. Central to Buddhism are the unsettling notions that everything we know is impermanent and that all we have is the here and now.\n\nTranscendental Meditation uses a mantra - the repetition of a single sound - to settle the mind into its least excited state. The TM folks, through the years, have consistently asserted their superiority over other disciplines.\n\nThe website of the non-profit Maharishi Foundation USA, for example, has variously claimed that \"only TM has been found in hundreds of studies to produce immediate and long-term wellness benefits of mind and body\" and that \"no other programme for personal development has received this level of attention and respect from the scientific community\".\n\nJust do it\n\nTranscendental Meditation was developed by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (n\u00e9e Mahesh Prasad Varma). Born near Jabalpur, India, around 1918, the Maharishi, or Great Seer, started teaching his method in 1955 and became a guru to the Beatles, who famously travelled to Rishikesh, India, in 1968 to study with him.\n\nDespite Transcendental Meditation's claims of superiority, John Denninger, director of research at the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, isn't so sure.\n\n\"I'm not convinced that any difference in outcome is big enough to say you need to do one type of meditation over another,\" Mr Denninger says. \"Getting people to do it in the first place is what matters.\"\n\nSome of the most striking research has come from the University of California at Davis. Clifford Saron, a neuroscientist there who speaks with the slow, gentle tone of a holy man, went to the foothills of the Himalayas in the 1990s to study Buddhist monks.\n\nTheir serene focus inspired him to organise the Shamatha Project. With his friend and former monk B Alan Wallace, Mr Saron selected 60 people and tested their attention and cognition. Thirty of them then attended a meditation retreat in Colorado. (The other 30 went later.)\n\nAfter three months, Mr Saron re-examined the initial group and discovered any number of striking changes. For one, the meditators were literally more perceptive: they could discern smaller differences between long and short lines flashed on a screen.\n\n\"How much does an infant learn when it is alert and relaxed?\" Mr Saron asks rhetorically. \"That works for us, as well.\"\n\nSome of his subjects also exhibited lowered levels of cortisol, the hormone produced by the adrenal gland to help us deal with stressful situations, such as getting chased by a water buffalo - or watching a stockholding get crushed after an unfavourable earnings report.\n\n(Cortisol is also associated with increased belly fat and diminished cognitive performance; in other words, it makes us fat and stupid.)\n\nPerhaps most surprising: levels of telomerase, an enzyme that protects genetic material during cell division and delays cell death, were higher in the retreat group. By boosting telomerase, meditation could possibly extend life.\n\nSceptics, including some who've logged countless hours of silent sitting, say that the promise of meditation sometimes exceeds what's practical. Tony Schwartz, author of Be Excellent at Anything: The Four Keys to Transforming the Way We Work and Live, says he's meditated for hundreds of hours, starting 25 years ago.\n\n\"But the more time I spent meditating, the less value I derived from it,\" he wrote in a January column in The New York Times. Nor has he seen evidence that the practice makes people happier or leads to better behaviour. \"Don't expect more than it can deliver,\" he wrote.\n\nMeditation's arrival on Wall Street closes a circle of sorts. Whereas Siddhartha Gautama took to the lotus position out of frustration with his riches, traders are hitting the mat to obtain them.\n\nRay Dalio, for example, runs the largest hedge fund firm in the world and is worth US$14 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He's also the most vocal proponent of meditation in finance and claims the practice has been the single biggest factor in his success.\n\nMr Dalio, 64, discovered Transcendental Meditation through the Beatles. He's been at it for 42 years, sitting for 20 minutes, twice on most days, he says. He's so convinced of its benefits that he pays half the cost of TM instruction for the employees at his Westport, Connecticut-based Bridgewater Associates LP.\n\nA competitive edge, not enlightenment, seems to be driving him. \"I feel like a ninja in a fight,\" Mr Dalio said of his professional equanimity, during a February panel discussion in New York on the benefits of meditation. \"When it comes at you, it seems like slow motion.\"\n\nPaul Tudor Jones is another hedge fund billionaire on a quest for inner peace and profit. A PBS documentary from 1987 shows him trading in the most agitated, un-Buddhalike manner imaginable.\n\nTwenty-five years later, he and his wife, Sonia, an Ashtanga yoga enthusiast, gave US$12 million to create the Contemplative Sciences Center at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, his alma mater.\n\nDavid Mick teaches an undergraduate business school course there called \"Cultivating Wisdom and Well-Being for Personal and Professional Growth\".\n\nHe recommends meditation and takes each semester's students on a field trip to Yogaville, a nearby ashram. \"You can't be a wiser person if you can't discipline your mind,\" says Mr Mick, who meditates every morning.\n\nWilloughby Britton, a neuroscientist at Brown University, warns that neophytes should proceed with caution. Spending hours contemplating impermanence can foster anxiety and sadness. She has seen people experience psychotic episodes on meditation retreats, convincing themselves, for example, that the teacher is evil and must be killed.\n\n\"This is a powerful drug; it's not a hot bath,\" Ms Britton says, adding that the risks are worth the rewards.\n\nUnlike some other Western practitioners, Joan Halifax, a roshi, or revered teacher, at the Upaya Zen Center in Santa Fe, New Mexico, says she's concerned that the lords of finance are using meditation for unjust ends, ignoring the moral principles embodied in Buddhism.\n\nEarn it first\n\n\"You can train people with meditation to be sharpshooters,\" she says. \"Are they trying to get smarter so they can exploit more people? Or are they interested in creating a more just financial system?\"\n\nMr Dalio, for one, has agreed to give most of his fortune to charity under the Giving Pledge programme started by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates - a move that would probably have impressed the Buddha himself, who lived by daana, or a spirit of generosity.\n\nBefore you give that fortune away, though, you have to earn it. Some of the brightest minds in finance are betting that meditation will help them do just that. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

It also intends to cut as many as 3,000 jobs from Alitalia's workforce of about 14,000.\n\nUntil now, a restructuring of Alitalia's debt has been the largest sticking point in a deal between the two airlines. The banks' reluctance to write off debt led Air France-KLM, which previously owned 25 per cent of Alitalia, to bow out of the rescue package last year. The French-Dutch carrier ultimately allowed its stake in Alitalia to shrink to 7 per cent.\n\nOver the past five years, Alitalia, which is not publicly traded, has cut costs, renegotiated contracts with workers and suppliers, and shed assets in a desperate bid to keep flying. But Italy's grinding economic crisis, high fuel costs and competition from low-cost rivals have overwhelmed the carrier's turnaround efforts.\n\nIn October the government of former prime minister Enrico Letta brokered a 500 million euro rescue that involved the purchase of a 12 per cent stake in Alitalia by Italy's state-owned post office.\n\nThat transaction led to objections from some rival European airlines, which argued that the deal violated EU restrictions on state aid to troubled companies.\n\nThe prospect of an investment by Etihad, which is wholly owned by the government of Abu Dhabi, raises similar concerns.\n\nLufthansa of Germany, for example, has argued that the purchase of shares in Alitalia \"whether via European states or by state companies outside the EU\" would constitute state aid and has urged the antitrust authorities in Brussels to block it.\n\nAnalysts say that 10-year-old Etihad is eager to add Alitalia to its stable of seven airlines in which it owns minority stakes. The company has invested more than US$1 billion in those carriers since first turning profitable in 2011.\n\nEtihad's airline holdings - which include a 29 per cent stake in Air Berlin, 20 per cent of Virgin Australia and 24 per cent of Jet Airways of India - have been a main driver of its growth, contributing a fifth of its US$6.1 billion in revenue last year. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/iata-trims-forecast-second-time-year", "site_title": "Iata trims forecast for second time this year", "publish_date": null, "content": "Iata trims forecast for second time this year\n\nIndustry body projects combined net profit of US$18b for global carriers\n\nPublished\n\nMon, Jun 2, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE International Air Transport Association (Iata) has trimmed its industry forecast for the second time this year, projecting a combined net profit of US$18 billion for global carriers, owing to slowing trade and weaker business confidence linked to China's economy.\n\nThis is on the back of revenues of US$746 billion, which translates to a thin profit margin of 2.4 per cent.\n\nIata last cut its forecast by US$1 billion to US$18.7 billion in March, citing higher fuel costs, from an earlier estimate of US$19.7 billion.\n\nHowever, profitability has been on an upward trend overall, gaining momentum from US$6.1 billion in 2012 to US$10.6 billion in 2013 - no small feat for an industry which has clocked profits in only half the years since 1945.\n\n\"The good news is that airline profits are improving,\" said Iata director-general Tony Tyler, speaking at the Iata annual general meeting (AGM) in Doha yesterday. \"The average return on invested capital today is 5.4 per cent - up from 1.4 per cent in 2008. But we are still far from earning the 7-8 per cent cost of capital that investors would expect. Airlines are, however, working towards solutions that deliver value to both customers and investors.\"\n\nThe AGM comes as the industry celebrates a hundred years of commercial aviation and three months after Malaysia Airlines' MH370 disappeared with 239 people onboard. Intensive multilateral search efforts have yielded little success in unearthing any signs of wreckage, turning a spotlight on the need for more stringent industry standards on global tracking capabilities.\n\nIata and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) are spearheading efforts on this front, with a taskforce of industry experts to deliver a draft of recommendations to ICAO by September. The immediate focus will be on tracking aircraft, rather than real-time streaming of flight data.\n\n\"Tracking aircraft is the most important, urgent first step and something that can be done relatively easily. There are a lot more issues that come into play when you look at streaming data,\" noted Mr Tyler, adding that streaming would result in \"masses and masses of data\" which may not be manageable.\n\nIndustry players have also highlighted that the cost burden to airlines that comes with changes to global standards will have to be considered as well.\n\nMr Tyler did not pin down a firm date as to when the enhanced standards would kick in.\n\nQatar Airways chief Akbar Al Baker reckons the taskforce will also explore ways to make sure systems on the aircraft cannot be switched off. In the case of MH370, the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (Acars), which enables ground stations and the aircraft to relay messages to each other, was disabled not too long after take-off.\n\nIn its 2014 update yesterday, Iata projected that all airlines are expected to post higher profits this year over last year, although performance will vary from region to region.\n\nAsia-Pacific carriers are expected to earn US$3.2 billion this year, down from March's estimate of US$3.7 billion, weighed down in part by a challenging Indian aviation market. But this also represents an increase from the US$2 billion seen last year, thanks to a pick-up in the cargo market where Asia-Pacific carriers hold the majority share. Passenger traffic in the region is slated to expand by 7.4 per cent this year, against 7 per cent growth in capacity, pushing load factor up 0.2 percentage point to 67.3 per cent.\n\nNorth American carriers - which have undergone restructuring and are building up ancillary revenues - will deliver the strongest financial performance this year with a bottomline of US$9.2 billion.\n\nAfrica will continue to remain the weakest region, just about remaining in the black with expected profits of US$100 million as intense competition and high taxes hamper performance.\n\nStruggling with regulatory and infrastructure costs, European carriers will deliver a bottomline of US$2.8 billion this year, while the Middle Eastern airlines - among the fastest-growing in the world - will deliver a net profit of US$1.6 billion with a high profit per passenger of US$8.98.\n\nGlobal passenger traffic is expected to remain firm at 5.9 per cent this year, inching up from 5.7 per cent last year, although premium traffic demand has eased in line with waning business confidence.\n\nCargo traffic, which started picking up in H2 2013, is also feeling the impact of softening world trade. Nonetheless, it is slated to expand at 3.1 per cent this year, up from 1.8 per cent in 2013.\n\nMeanwhile, jet fuel - which makes up nearly 30 per cent of operating costs for airlines - will remain stable at over US$124 per barrel but stubbornly high by historical standards, resulting in a one per cent increase in the industry's fuel bill.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Some of these services we do not have, and (there are) areas where we could expand our resources and strength. So by doing the M&As it will help us to do more,\" Mr Tan explains, in an interview.\n\nThe group listed on the SGX in January this year at 25 cents per share for 174 million shares, to give it a market capitalisation of $177.5 million. It was a popular IPO with investors, as its share offering, which was 5.8 times subscribed, jumped as much as 28 per cent in price on its debut.\n\nYard extension\n\nThis backing by investors and cash proceeds from the listing has encouraged the company to expand. Mr Tan discloses that part of the cash proceeds would be used to finance M&A activity.\n\nIt would also go towards the proposed extension and enhancement of the company's yard, for which it is currently awaiting JTC approval, Mr Tan confirms.\n\nKim Heng's continued growth and strong financial performance would continue to underpin investor confidence, Mr Tan believes. For its first quarter ended March 31, Kim Heng's net profit grew 16 per cent year-on-year to $3.9 million as revenue also increased 10 per cent to $23.6 million. This was on the back of higher revenue from its chartering and towage services, as well as its marine offshore support services.\n\nKim Heng's strong financial results could spill over into subsequent quarters, as Mr Tan suggests that yards in Korea and China continue to build rigs to be deployed.\n\n\"We see continued delivery of rigs from these yards and also from Brazil and Africa to this part of the world. Everybody is looking to the region because Asia is a energy-hungry region where everyone is trying to maximise domestic production. So we expected that activity will increase in the next six months to a year.\"\n\nMr Tan is optimistic that charter rates would also continue to rise as offshore support activities increase in tandem with the increase in rigs being deployed, giving Kim Heng's revenue prospects a boost.\n\nHe admits, however, that there is a chance of a base-case scenario as there is risk of some over-capacity developing in the rig market, particularly in the jack-up and drill ship floater market.\n\nEven so, Mr Tan points out that such a scenario is unlikely to affect Kim Heng's prospects. \"For us, we are providing rig services, so whether the rig is stagnant and looking for work or doing work, they still need services from us to support the rig. In that sense, we are indispensable to the drilling contractors as they need people to run the rigs - suppliers, welders, cleaners or to send a piece of equipment to the rig.\"\n\nRobust outlook\n\nOverall, Mr Tan has targeted a 20-30 per cent growth for Kim Heng in the next one year as he highlights that the global drilling outlook remains very robust.\n\nThe group has secured forward commitments of over $40 million with Mr Tan revealing that these comprise projects for rig servicing and maintenance and supply contracts, with most of them to be recognised in the next \"two or three months\".\n\nMr Tan adds that these projects are for new rigs that are currently being built as well as for existing ones in operation. He expects these forward commitments to grow as there are rigs coming in from Europe towards the end of the year.\n\nWith offshore services and rig demand continuing to grow in the region, Kim Heng's planned expansion could lead it to be at the right place at the right time. And its IPO has given it the financial muscle that it needs to achieve its goals.\n\nmsingh@sph.com.sg\n\n@MalminderjitBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is an agreement that all the countries involved want to sign on the dotted line and expect to be fully bound by the deal, and nothing less.\n\n\"That's an amazing thing, because we're talking about some pretty big issues like market access and intellectual property,\" said Mr Wagar. \"We all want to make sure that people are looking at the fine print on page 22, paragraph 4, to get the right deal.\"\n\nTwo weeks ago, Singapore hosted talks involving ministers of the 12 TPP countries for the third time in just six months, a fact Mr Wagar said spoke volumes of the Republic's role in the negotiation process.\n\nThe chief negotiators of each nation are expected to meet again in July at a venue yet to be announced.\n\n\"Everyone left the last ministerial meeting feeling very positive about the progress made, and I think (the TPP) is something that will get done soon, because it's a good deal,\" he said.\n\nApart from throwing his support behind the TPP, Mr Wagar has, since moving to Singapore, advocated to different groups the merits of the US as the \"safest and best place\" for foreign direct investment.\n\nLast October, he led a business delegation from Singapore to an inaugural investment summit in Washington meant to showcase the US as an attractive place to do business in.\n\n\"One thing about America that makes us different from others is that it is the most open economy in the world.

A plane seating 180 people in two classes able to fly as long as nine hours would also meet requirements from Almaty, Kazakhstan-based Air Astana on so-called long, thin routes, Mr Foster said.\n\n\"They made absolutely clear that this is now firming up and that they'll be making an announcement soon,\"Mr Foster said of the Doha discussions. \"That for us is very interesting.\"\n\nThe new aircraft would help fill the gap in Chicago-based Boeing's roster of new jets between the 737 Max, set to debut late this decade, and the 787 Dreamliner.\n\nAirbus Group has been gaining sales in the transcontinental segment with its long-range A321, and could make further headway if executives move forward with plans to outfit its medium-range A330 with more fuel-efficient engines.\n\n\"We continue to watch trends and speak to our customers to determine what the market will require in the years to come,\" Doug Alder, a Boeing spokesman, said on Friday. \"Today, we're very focused on our current development programs: the 777X, the 737 Max and the 787-10.\"\n\nAir Astana, which is 49 per cent owned by British defence company BAE Systems, has issued a request for proposals for 11 stopgap jets to replace five 757s and a handful of other ageing planes, with Airbus's re-engined A321neo emerging as the best prospect for the niche, Mr Foster said.\n\nAir Astana is seeking deliveries starting in 2017, with the planes on eight-year leases expiring from about the time that a 757 successor would become available in 2024 or 2025, the executive said.\n\nDiscussions are under way with lessors including AerCap Holdings and Air Lease Corp, and an A321 order probably will be announced as soon as October, he said.\n\nFounded in 2002 as part of a planned BAE deal to sell radar equipment to the Kazakh government, Air Astana has expanded to offer 60 services, 38 of them international. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Yesterday's session yielded a 7.5-point loss - hardly surprising, given that the index had jumped 17 points on Thursday, a rise that some observers thought was a feeble attempt at early half-year-ending window dressing.\n\nTurnover throughout the week dipped regularly below the $1 billion mark. Volume yesterday amounted to 1.6 billion units worth $727.3 million. Excluding warrants, there were 189 rises versus 205 falls. It was only marginally better than Tuesday's six-month low of $697 million.\n\nOf the top 20 most actively traded stocks, 17 were priced below 20 cents. Many ended firmer, especially those for which some sort of announcement was made.\n\nFor instance, Adventus' recent rise continued with a 0.1 cent rise to 4.5 cents with 40 million traded, bringing its gain for the week to 1.6 cents or 55 per cent. In reply to a query from the Singapore Exchange (SGX), the company said it is considering appointing a major shareholder as one of its directors.\n\nSemiconductor firm STATS ChipPAC's shares shot up 4 cents or 7 per cent over the week to 61.5 cents on renewed takeover expectations. Last month, the company said it was in talks to be taken over by an interested party; this month, it said those talks had ended, but that other parties were also interested. Market sources believe at least four foreign companies could be interested.\n\nAnother firm which was in takeover talks that have since fizzled out is RH Petrogas. On May 20, the company said its major shareholders had been approached by an interested takeover party, but by Friday last week, the deal was off.\n\nThe stock fell 14.5 cents on Monday; for the week it was down 15.5 cents or 17 per cent at 76 cents.\n\nSimilarly, PNE Micron yesterday said its substantial shareholders had informed the company that they are in late-stage discussions with potential investors who are interested to acquire part of their stakes in the company which in aggregate will not exceed 30 per cent of the total issued and paid-up share capital in the company; the parties are working on the documentation.\n\nAlthough PNE added that no agreement has been reached, that there is no certainty a deal will be concluded and that the market should trade with care, PNE's shares yesterday gained 0.9 cent or 24 per cent to close at 4.8 cents with 68.5 million traded.\n\nElsewhere, property and construction firm Yoma Strategic said during the week that it will raise a net amount of $92.8 million through a placement of 135 million new shares at 70 cents each.\n\nOCBC Investment Research yesterday maintained a \"buy\" on the counter, despite lowering its fair value from 85 to 82 cents to factor in the dilution from the placement.\n\nYoma yesterday fell 2 cents to 72 cents with eight million traded.\n\nOver in the US, news that its first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 2.9 per cent suggests that the recovery is not as robust as the US Federal Reserve and some analysts have made it out to be. Fortunately for equity markets, Wall Street did not react violently to the news, possibly because it means that interest rates will have to be kept artificially depressed longer than earlier thought.\n\nDBS Group Research yesterday said that the whole world is looking for a big GDP rebound by the US in Q2. It said: \"The whole world is likely to be disappointed. Thanks to weak consumption, it now appears that 2Q GDP growth will be 3 per cent at best - growth in the first six months of 2014 will be about zero. Does the fact that 3 per cent growth is 'above-trend' make up for Q1? Not even modestly...\n\n\"(On Thursday) we downgraded our 2014 growth forecast to 1.6 per cent from 2.1 per cent previously. Already, even that 1.6 per cent looks suspect. The five-year downtrend in GDP growth continues.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By VICTORIA HO\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jun 1, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nE-COMMERCE site Lazada has launched in Singapore, two years after setting up its headquarters here. The dotcom already operates in five other Asean countries. According to a recent study by PayPal, Singapore's e-commerce spend is expected to reach US$4.4 billion by 2015.\n\nBizIT first reported in February that Lazada was planning to launch here by Q2, with CEO Max Bittner saying in an interview then that the company hopes to be the Amazon.com of Singapore, and wants to move in before its US counterpart does.\n\nRight now,\n\nAmazon.com\n\nships to Singapore, but offers free shipping only on some items costing over US$125, and shipping takes 10-14 days on average.\n\nLazada has set up shipping partnerships with SingPost and logistics player Ta-Q-Bin, and offers free shipping on items, with delivery times of about a day or two.\n\nSpeaking at Lazada's launch event last week, Mr Bittner said he hopes that completing the fulfilment piece of the puzzle will pull customers over to Lazada as a top destination, the way US residents see\n\nAmazon.com\n\n.\n\nDestination site\n\nThe company's head honcho said that despite Singapore's relatively mature e-commerce audience, there still isn't a \"destination site\" such as an\n\nAmazon.com\n\n, where people head to obtain most consumer goods such as household goods or electronics.\n\nFor now, popular sites such as\n\nQoo10.sg\n\nand sister site Zalora offer a different experience, he said. Zalora carries fashion items only, and although Qoo10.sg carries a wider range of goods, the decentralised marketplace acts more like a listing for various sellers' individual shops. There is no cross-selling of goods, or a central catalogue of items on the site like that found on\n\nAmazon.com\n\n, and buyers on sites like Qoo10.sg can browse only within individual stores designed by each seller.\n\nLazada was set up in February 2012, and today operates in Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia.\n\nWhile it has had its HQ in Singapore from day one, the company has taken this long to launch here because the company was keener on penetrating the region's emerging markets, to catch the growing wave of users coming online.\n\n\"It's very different doing e-commerce in developing markets versus developed markets,\" noted Mr Bittner, on the difference in strategies needed to operate in Singapore compared with its neighbours.\n\nFor emerging markets, e-commerce's big advantage over brick-and-mortar stores is the ability to access a wider variety of goods compared with what's in the stores. This is especially apparent in second- and third-tier cities in Asia, where stores carry a far more limited selection of goods, he said.\n\nIn Singapore, this is hardly the case, because large malls are within a stone's throw of most places. Lazada is instead touting the convenience of shopping online without having to hunt down an item, and hopes to work with more suppliers to drive better deals on the site to attract bargain hunters, Mr Bittner said.\n\nIn Singapore, Lazada carries all of its listed goods on consignment. When an order is placed, it picks up the item from the supplier and takes it to the buyer.\n\nThis is different from Lazada's hybrid inventory model in other parts of Asia, where it owns some of the items, and ships those out to buyers from its warehouse.\n\nMarketplace\n\nMaxime Lemiere, marketplace managing director of Lazada Southeast Asia, said that the third-party consignment model which it calls Marketplace is growing. About 40 per cent of volume shipped comes from the Marketplace, which has about 2,000 active sellers.\n\nThis proportion is growing in the region, and Lazada will increasingly lean on Marketplace as a source of goods, he said.\n\nHe added that Singapore will stay fully on the Marketplace model, because that transfers risk over to sellers, and allows Lazada to scale up its inventory much more quickly without dealing with warehousing of all the goods.\n\nHowever, the hybrid model will stay in some of the other markets, because Lazada has managed to strike up some exclusive distribution deals in some places that allow it to carry goods more cheaply, or offer them to consumers ahead of time.\n\nLazada estimates that just one per cent of total shopping gets done online in the Asean region. In China, it is about 8 per cent, and in Brazil it is about 3-4 per cent.\n\nThe region is coming to the online shopping market later than other parts of the world, in part because the lack of Internet access poses a real barrier, said Martell Hardenberg, co-founder and managing director of Lazada. \"That (issue) is strongly being overcome now,\" he said.\n\nLazada had 79 million visits in the first quarter this year, 41 per cent higher than in the corresponding quarter last year, he added. Last month, it shipped over 300,000 orders in the region, double the volume six months ago.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the last two years alone, more than 100 million people around the world have migrated to cities, and it is estimated that 70 per cent of the global population will live in cities by 2050.\n\nCities have continued to grow in importance with each passing year, and urbanisation is proceeding on an \"unprecedented scale\", said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the combined opening ceremonies of three major global events last night.\n\nThese were the Singapore International Water Week, World Cities Summit and the CleanEnviro Summit Singapore.\n\n\"Cities are driving economic growth and creating new hubs for talent and innovation. Cities are also pioneering solutions for the world's problems, such as climate change, public health or green technology,\" he said during the ceremony held at the Marina Bay Sands Expo and Convention Centre.\n\nMr Lee noted how, at the same time, new challenges have emerged. Climate change, for instance, has caused unpredictable extreme weather, with Cairo seeing its first snowfall after a century, while London has had to deal with flooding.\n\n\"We must continue to improve our cities and give our people a high-quality environment to live, work and play,\" he told his audience that included city experts and government officials from all over the world.\n\nOn its part, the Singapore government is doing its best to develop the country as both a liveable and sustainable city, such as by managing the consumption of energy and water and pricing these scarce resources properly so that people are incentivised to save and not waste them.\n\nThe government, said Mr Lee, has taken a long-term view by planning over generations, implementing programmes over several election terms, and rallying Singaporeans to forgo some immediate gains for future dividends.\n\nHe cited the example of the Marina Bay area, which was \"once the mouth of a dirty river, dotted with pollutive industries and slums, (but is) now a jewel in our cityscape, a place all of us are very proud of\".\n\nThe prime minister noted that while the government's efforts so far have gained Singapore recognition in international rankings, the journey to improve the country is one that will never end.\n\nThis is because the expectations of Singaporeans are rising, and other cities, too, are continuing to move ahead, developing innovative solutions and setting new standards.\n\nSingapore is learning from the lessons elsewhere in order to make the country a better home, be it by providing affordable housing and more reliable public transport, or adding more green spaces into the urban areas or strengthening social capital.\n\nThe government is studying the experiences of other cities, such as London's public transport system and Copenhagen's downtown parks.\n\nIn his speech, Mr Lee also hailed this year's two Lee Kuan Yew prize winners as good examples of what successful cities can achieve.\n\nThe Chinese city of Suzhou, winner of the World City Prize, has built a good partnership with Singapore to develop the Suzhou Industrial Park, which has helped develop a thriving economy while protecting the city's cultural landmarks.\n\nAnd Orange County Water District from California in the United States, which bagged the Water Prize, has seen its pioneering groundwater recharge and water re-use schemes adapted throughout the world, including in Singapore when the country embarked on its NEWater programme.\n\nBoth winners will receive their awards at a dinner graced by President Tony Tan Keng Yam later today.\n\nThe last Singapore International Water Week in 2012 saw a record $13.6 billion in announcements worth of deals, tenders and investments.\n\nAbout 20,000 delegates are expected to attend this year, close to the number that attended two years ago.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

On the selling side, there were rare insider sales in Swissco Holdings after the stock rebounded by 34 per cent.\n\nDuty Free International\n\nDuty-free retailer Duty Free International recorded its first buybacks since March 2013 with 1.94 million shares purchased from May 29 to 30 at 31 cents each. The trades were made on the back of the 28 per cent drop in the share price March 2013 from 43 cents. The group previously acquired 11.7 million shares from December 2012 to March 2013 at 32.5 cents to 43 cents each or an average of 39.9 cents each. The repurchases since December 2012 are the company's first buybacks since the stock was listed in June 2003. The recent buybacks bode well for shareholders as the stock rose by an average of 9 per cent three months following their purchases based on 26 filings since 2012. The stock recorded a price gain three months after on 81 per cent of those purchases. The counter closed at 31 cents on Friday.\n\nRyobi Kiso Holdings\n\nGround engineering solutions provider Ryobi Kiso Holdings bought back for the first time since December 2013 with 1.23 million shares purchased from May 27 to 29 at an average of 10.4 cents each. The trades, which accounted for 88 per cent of the stock's trading volume, were made on the back of the 12 per cent drop in the share price since January from 11.8 cents. The group previously acquired 10.5 million shares from April 2012 to December 2013 at 13.4 cents to 10.5 cents each or an average of 12.6 cents each and 7.7 million shares from March to October 2011 at 17.5 cents to 13.5 cents each or an average of 15.5 cents each. The company announced on May 2 a third-quarter loss of $1.61 million versus a profit of $188,000 in the same quarter last year. Loss in the first nine months was $2.643 million versus a profit of $1.302 million in the same period last year. The stock closed at 10.4 cents on Friday.\n\nFalcon Energy Group\n\nCOO Neo Chin Lee recorded his first on-market trade in marine, oil and gas services provider Falcon Energy Group since January 2009 with 500,000 shares purchased on May 28 at 39 cents each. The trade increased his holdings to 12.500 million shares or 1.53 per cent of the issued capital. The acquisition was made on the back of the 22 per cent rebound in the share price since April from 32 cents. Despite the rebound in the share price, the counter is still down since September 2013 from 44 cents.\n\nThe purchase was also made after the company announced on May 28 a year-end profit of US$102.12 million, sharply up from the previous year's loss of US$2.395 million. Mr Neo previously acquired an initial 10 million shares in January 2009 at 26 cents each. Investors should note that there were buybacks by the company earlier this year with 1.2 million shares purchased from Jan 23 to 24 at an average of 37.5 cents each.\n\nThe group previously acquired 400,000 shares on Jan 2 at 37 cents each, 792,000 shares in December 2013 at an average of 36.4 cents each and 3.43 million shares in September 2013 at 35-44 cents each or an average of 38.2 cents each. The counter closed at 40.5 cents on Friday.\n\nJunma Tyre Cord Company\n\nExecutive chairman Yang Peixing recorded his first on-market trades in industrial yarn and dipped tyre cords manufacturer Junma Tyre Cord since May 2012 with 161,000 shares purchased from May 26 to 29 at 6.7 cents to 9.2 cents each or an average of 7.2 cents each. The trades increased his direct holdings to 15.331 million shares or 20.89 per cent of the issued capital. The acquisitions were made after the stock fell by as much as 41 per cent from 11.2 cents in April. The counter is also sharply down since July 2012 from 32 cents.\n\nMr Yang previously acquired 406,000 shares from November 2011 to May 2012 at an average of 34.2 cents each. Prior to his trades since 2011, the chairman acquired $776,000 worth of shares from April 2006 to June 2009. The company announced on May 12 a first-quarter profit of RMB10.071 million, up from the loss of RMB35.722 million in the same period last year. The counter last traded at 9.2 cents.\n\nAdvanced Holdings\n\nExecutive director Axron Lim Gwee Koon recorded his first trade in process equipment designer and provider Advanced Holdings since March 2011 with 25,000 shares purchased on May 26 at 27 cents each. The trade increased his direct holdings by 14 per cent to 205,000 shares or 0.07 per cent of the issued capital. The acquisition was made on the back of the 12 per cent drop in the share price since February from 30.5 cents.\n\nDespite the fall in the share price, the counter is still up since December 2013 from 24 cents. He previously acquired 130,000 shares in March 2011 at 23 cents each. Also positive this year is shareholder Lim Pang Hern with a purchase-related filing on March 4 of 100,000 shares at 28 cents each, which boosted his stake (direct and deemed) to 18.282 million shares or 6.01 per cent.\n\nMr Lim became a substantial shareholder in September 2013 after he acquired an initial 17.000 million shares or 5.6 per cent of the issued capital at 42 cents each. Advanced Holdings announced on May 9 an 18.8 per cent gain in first-quarter net profit to $600,000. The counter closed at 25.5 cents on Friday.\n\nProgen Holdings\n\nManaging director Lee Ee resumed buying shares of air-conditioning and mechanical ventilation systems supplier Progen Holdings after the stock rebounded by 10 per cent from 14.5 cents on May 12 with 900,000 shares purchased on May 26 at 15.9 cents each. The trade increased his direct holdings to 60.052 million shares or 22.08 per cent of the issued capital. He also has deemed interest of 913,000 shares or 0.336 per cent. He previously acquired 8.6 million shares from Feb 27 to April 30 at 13 cents to 16 cents each or an average of 14 cents each. Prior to his purchases since February, the chairman acquired nearly 21 million shares from August to October 2013 at an average of 14.9 cents each and 2.2 million shares from April to May 2013 at an average of 15.8 cents each.\n\nPrior to his purchases since 2013, Mr Lee acquired 1.83 million shares in May 2012 at 16 cents each, 1.35 million shares in August 2007 at seven cents each and 5.93 million shares from December 2002 to November 2004 via married deal and open market trades at 9.5 cents to 17 cents each or an average of 14.4 cents each. The counter last traded at 15.8 cents on Friday.\n\nSwissco Holdings\n\nIndependent non-executive director Lim How Teck recorded his first on-market trades in offshore oil and gas marine services provider Swissco Holdings since his April 2010 board appointment with 100,000 shares sold (May 27-28) at 43 cents each. This cut his direct holdings by half to 100,000 shares (0.02 per cent of issued capital).\n\nThe disposals were made on the back of the 34 per cent rebound in the share price since March from 32 cents. The counter is also sharply up since March 2012 from 18.8 cents. The sales were made at a profit based on the 200,000 shares he acquired via exercise of options on May 15 at 24 cents each. Swissco announced on May 9 a 107.2 per cent gain in first-quarter profit to $3.745 million. The counter closed at 43.5 cents on Friday.\n\nThe writer is managing director, Asia Insider Ltd\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Stock traders care only about what's coming next.\n\nThe GDP (gross domestic product) data was dismissed as a distillation of reports that were already available to the market; everyone knew the US consumer was effectively snowed in from January through March.\n\nWhat reassured bullish traders over the last couple of weeks was the relatively strong April housing data and a modest increase in consumer spending. Luxury retailers such as Michael Kors and Kate Spade are reporting booming sales growth.\n\nAll this, alongside higher consumer-credit readings, suggests the streak of thriftiness that came over the US consumer during the Great Recession is largely forgotten. The winter slowdown is over, and aspirational shoppers are splashing out on houses, expensive labels and other big-ticket items once again.\n\nThis week, economists expect May auto sales to remain more or less in line with the robust April report. On Friday, the Labor Department is expected to report that the economy added roughly 218,000 jobs to payrolls in May.\n\nThat's considerably less than the April report and the unemployment rate may even tick up from 6.3 per cent, but it's still consistent with a labour market in hiring mode. Only a number below 200,000 would be enough to undo the market's guarded economic optimism.\n\nIn other major markets, economic weakness looks longer-term in nature. The eurozone technically emerged from an 18-month recession in the first quarter but most of the heavy lifting was done by Germany and France. Many Southern European economies are still shrinking. Europe also has to contend with potential war on its borders.\n\nFrom a US perspective, the situation in Ukraine may have improved because Russia appears to have pulled back troops from the border. But there's a risk the recent clashes will escalate into a full-scale war on Europe's doorstep.\n\nFor months, the ECB has promised to revive the European economic recovery with stimulative policies. If the bank fails to deliver at its meeting on Thursday, it will have set global markets up for a fall.\n\nTo fend off deflation, the ECB will likely move to negative interest rates for bank deposits, said economists at brokerage Nomura Securities in a research note. In other words, the ECB will discourage banks from parking their reserves rather than lending them out by charging a fee for the privilege.\n\nWhile technology and biotech stocks rebounded during last week's rally, many of them are still far from their February and March highs. Twitter has slid to below its initial public offering price as analysts warn the messaging service is more of a niche than a mass medium.\n\nTwitter's fall from grace also reflects a change in investors' tastes this year - a slight retreat from the ebullience that drove major indexes up by more than 30 per cent last year to a more cautious optimism.\n\nRather than chasing volatile momentum stocks for mega bucks, investors are seeking to lock in small gains in a steadier, dividend-paying niches such as utility stocks. Indeed, utilities have led the S&P 500 sectors in the latest round of gains.\n\n\"What you've seen over the last four or five months is a sector-by-sector correction as opposed to a broad correction,\" said Oliver Pursche, president of money manager Gary Goldberg Financial Services. \"You haven't seen the major indexes - the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Standard & Poor's 500, drop by 10 per cent as in a traditional correction. But the small caps have dropped by 10 per cent, the biotechs got hit 10 per cent or more, financials got hit for a little while . . . so it's been a kind of a stealth correction.\"\n\nAnother sign of caution among investors is the Treasury market, where bonds have gained in value even as the Fed slows its purchases.\n\nStocks and Treasuries rarely rise together for long. Some market analysts say one emerging threat could abruptly stop the rally in both.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia president Charles Plosser said inflation appeared to be drifting up towards the 2 per cent level which is the Fed's upper limit of normality. Kansas City Fed president Esther George has called for rate hikes \"shortly\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is especially so in the case of its stores located in shopping malls, where rents can rise up to 10 per cent each time leases come up for renewal.\n\n\"We would prefer larger showrooms, but the costs of these spaces make it challenging,\" said Sean O'Hara, general manager of furniture and interior design firm Serrano Holdings.\n\n\"There is also the belief that you reap what you sow. So investing in a prime retail location should pay for itself in terms of traffic, which can be converted to sales,\" he added. \"The reality is that this is not guaranteed.\"\n\nAside from rentals, increased levies on foreign workers have had an impact.\n\n\"Increased levies obviously translate to direct costs, but beyond that, trying to get Singaporeans to do the jobs we need is challenging,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Alison Kwok, executive director of interior construction firm Cathay Interiors, a carpenter training programme initiated by the Singapore Furniture Industries Council (SFIC) failed to attract many locals who were willing to commit to the rigours of the profession. While traditional master carpenters work six-day weeks, many of the applicants to the training programme want to work only five days a week, making them less attractive to employers.\n\nTo better cope with their problems, some in the industry want the government to review its manpower policies.\n\n\"I think I am not alone when I say that I hope the government can reconsider its manpower policy and look at the different industries rather than use a broad-brush approach,\" said Mr O'Hara.\n\nCompanies are also keen to look at boosting productivity to get the most out of their workers.\n\nFurniture company Koda has sent its staff for upgrading courses over the past two years and invested in an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.\n\n\"The reduction of cost by trimming down on labour and reducing overheads no longer solves the issue,\" said Ernie Koh, executive director of sales and marketing at Koda. \"We need to reflect on more innovative ways of increasing productivity.\"\n\nAutomating certain processes is another way to boost productivity.\n\nMarcus Wong, business development director at furnishings retailer and manufacturer Danovel, noted that with government grants and programmes such as Spring Singapore's Capability Development Grant, small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs) are more able to invest in machinery to improve their productivity. Danovel has invested in a cutting machine to help boost productivity.\n\nAutomation extends beyond the production floor.\n\nSaid Chris Ang, general manager of furniture retailer and manufacturer Woody Antique Furniture: \"In terms of the sales staff, we are automating our invoicing and product catalogues in an effort to increase productivity while maintaining the same high standard of service.\"\n\nStar Furniture and Woody Antique House have also started to explore the possibility of using an online showroom.\n\n\"Through e-commerce, we pay zero rental and minimal manpower cost,\" said Star Furniture's Ms Xu.\n\nThe firm, whose e-commerce platform was launched in February last year, initially had 10 per cent of its products displayed online. Because of the platform's popularity, the firm is looking into expanding its online product offerings to serve a wider base of customers.\n\nFirms are also outsourcing operations and stock to other countries in the region, where rents are lower. At Koda, non-key jobs such as accounting and administrative work have been relocated to Vietnam, China and Malaysia. Woody Antique House, meanwhile, is considering storing some of its inventory in factories overseas to save on warehouse space here.\n\nCompanies are investing in design, too. Star Furniture recently tied up with a local designer for one of its newer collections, JotterGoods.\n\nKoda's Mr Koh, who is also president of SFIC, feels that design should be embraced by the furniture industry.\n\n\"It is important to view strong design capabilities as a key element to stay competitive,\" he said.\n\nCathay Interiors' Ms Kwok believes it is important to ensure that there is a market for well-designed pieces that come with a higher price tag.\n\nGiving an example of how a massage in Thailand is much cheaper than one here, furniture that is considered expensive in Singapore may still be moderately priced elsewhere and sell well, she said.\n\nTo market local furniture overseas, furniture companies should take a leaf from Singapore Airlines' book, Ms Kwok said. Good design, service and presentation are key selling points, she noted. By building up a good reputation, the Singapore brand will become more attractive to customers.\n\nUltimately, companies should come up with customised solutions and strategies.\n\n\"I think each individual company will have to develop its own coping strategies based on its specific challenges. I don't know that there is a one-size-fits-all solution,\" said Mr O'Hara.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Sixteen companies recorded 26 purchases worth $2.56 million, against six with 13 disposals valued at $740,000. The number of firms and trades were similar to those of the previous week, when there were 16 firms and 30 purchases on the buying side and seven companies and 10 disposals on the selling side. But the trade values for the period were sharply down from the previous week's purchases of $5.6 million and sales of $4.35 million.\n\nBuyback activity was also flat last week with eight companies posting 31 repurchases worth $7.97 million. The number of firms and value were about the same as the previous week's nine companies and $8.57 million. The number of trades, on the other hand, was sharply up from the previous week's 24 transactions.\n\nThere were several significant corporate shareholder trades. There were buybacks in Global Palm Resources and Chosen Holdings and director purchases in Fragrance Group, CapitaRetail China Trust, and Yamada Green Resources; and substantial shareholder sales in CapitaLand, The Straits Trading Company, Technics Oil & Gas and CNMC Goldmine.\n\nChosen Holdings\n\nPlastic injection mouldings and plastic components manufacturer Chosen Holdings picked up where it left off in March. It purchased 269,000 shares from June 25 to 26 at an average of 14.1 cents each. The group had acquired 420,000 shares from March 5 to 21 at 13 cents each. The trades since March were made as the share price recovered from 11.5 cents in January.\n\nPrior to the buybacks this year, the company acquired 311,000 shares from Dec 4 to 6, 2013, at 12 cents each. The repurchases since December 2013 are the company's first buybacks since the stock was listed in February 1999. The stock last closed at 14 cents.\n\nGlobal Palm Resources\n\nPalm oil and kernels producer Global Palm Resources bought back for the first time since listing in April 2010 465,000 shares from June 20 to 27 at an average of 20.3 cents each. The trades, which accounted for 65 per cent of the stock's trading volume, were made on the back of a 56 per cent rebound in the share price since February, from 13 cents. The counter is still down since July 2011, from 30 cents. The group's purchase price was sharply lower than the IPO price of 46 cents. The counter closed at 20.5 cents on Friday.\n\nFragrance Group\n\nExecutive chairman and CEO Koh Wee Meng, who last bought shares in the Fragrance Group in March, resumed buying in the property developer and hotel operator.

All 48 group games have been completed, and the tournament is now in the crucial knockout stage. For the 16 nations still standing, there is no more room for error. The deal is simple - lose, and you're on the next plane home. There will not be any draws as all matches must produce a winner, be it in extra time or via the lottery of the dreaded penalty shoot-out.\n\nIt wasn't an easy task, but we've picked out the standout performers and talking points of the 2014 Fifa World Cup so far. This list will invariably change by the end of the tournament on July 13, but it's safe to say that these teams and players have left an indelible mark - good or bad - on The Beautiful Game.\n\nBest team - The Netherlands\n\nThis was a tough choice, but the Dutch have certainly done enough to impress in Brazil, winning all three games in the so-called Group of Death in ruthless fashion. After a stunning 5-1 demolition of the 2010 champions Spain, Louis van Gaal's men kept up the momentum by netting another five goals past Australia and Chile.\n\nHolland have certainly come a long way since their disgraceful show at the final in South Africa four years ago. This time, with Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben forming an irresistible partnership, the Oranje will fancy themselves to go one step further and win their first-ever World Cup trophy.\n\nBiggest surprise - Costa Rica\n\nIf anyone had said before the tournament that tiny Costa Rica would have topped a group that included three former world champions, I would have packed them off to the nearest mental hospital right away.\n\nThe Latin Americans first shocked Uruguay 3-1, silenced Italy 1-0, and then drew with England to finish undefeated. It's an amazing achievement, and now only fellow overachiever Greece stand between them and a place in the quarter-finals.\n\nBiggest flops - Spain\n\nThere were quite a few contenders for this dubious honour, but the nod has to go to the Spaniards. After sitting pretty at the top of international football for the last six years, they came crashing down to earth at this World Cup.\n\nVicente del Bosque's men never fully recovered from that humbling loss to Holland, and were outplayed for long periods against Chile. A comfortable 3-0 win over Australia in a meaningless final match only served to cover the cracks in this ageing team temporarily.\n\nMany of the veterans will have played their last game in the famous red jersey. It's not the end of a dynasty just yet, of course, with the team looking to defend its European Championship crown in 2016.\n\nBiggest letdown - Luis Suarez\n\nGoodness me, where do you start with this fellow? He misses Uruguay's opening defeat to Costa Rica because of injury, comes back to score two mesmerising goals to send England out of the World Cup, and then completely loses his marbles by biting - yes, biting - the shoulder of an Italian player.\n\nA defiant Suarez got his comeuppance. He's now banned from world football for four months. Some say he's gotten off lightly for a repeat offender. Will he ever come good and let his boots do the talking, instead of his teeth? Whichever way you look at it, this man never seems to learn.\n\nBest goal - Tim Cahill\n\nWhen Robin van Persie scored with an absurd diving header against Spain on day two of the tournament, that goal was hailed as a near-certainty to bag the goal of the tournament award.\n\nA week later, Australia's Tim Cahill laid claim to that prize. Against the Dutch, the 34-year-old midfielder let fly with a sumptuous volley - on his weaker left foot, no less - that rattled the bar before bulging the back of the net.\n\nEven when Cahill is 90 years old, he will still have people knocking on his door asking him to relive that moment in Porto Alegre. That audacious strike will be talked about for decades to come.\n\nMost thrilling match - USA 2 Portugal 2\n\nThis World Cup has had its fair share of five-star matches, the likes of Germany's 2-2 draw with Ghana and France's 5-2 thumping of Switzerland immediately come to mind. But it is the United States' dramatic 2-2 draw against Portugal that is top of the pile here.\n\nThe Americans were 30 seconds away from escaping a difficult group, but Cristiano Ronaldo delivered one of the greatest crosses of the tournament for Silvestre Varela to level the scores in the 95th minute. Pure agony for the US, and an intense finish to a riveting match for everyone watching in the stands and at home.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

More than 4,000 hours of engine testing have been conducted since trials began in September 2010, according to Bombardier's website.\n\nThe company has said the CSeries will cost about 15 per cent less to operate and produce less noise.\n\nBombardier's biggest customer for the CSeries, Republic Airways Holdings Inc, said earlier last month that it's considering whether to take the planes after a change in airline strategy.\n\n\"The whole point of 'testing' an aircraft is to find out if everything works perfectly - and then fix it before it enters service,\" Mr Stallard noted. \"We've seen other testing issues in the past, but ultimately the issues have been addressed and the aircraft has entered operation. We expect this to be the case with the GTF,\" he added.\n\nWhile rare, damaging engine failures during flight operations and ground trials do occur.\n\nIn August 2010, a Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Trent 1000 engine for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner suffered a blowout on a testbed in the United Kingdom. Three months later, a Trent 900 model exploded on an Airbus A380 flown by Qantas Airways Ltd.\n\nIn 2012, a Dreamliner doing high-speed taxi tests spewed debris from its General Electric Co engine, igniting a grass fire along a runway at the Charleston, South Carolina, airport near Boeing's new factory.\n\nBombardier is planning 2,400 hours of test flights for the CSeries.\n\nAs of May 1, the company had logged about 280 hours of flight tests, or about 12 per cent of the planned total. The FTV1 was the first CSeries prototype to fly, debuting on Sept 16.\n\n\"It is unlikely in our view that the investigation period would create another delay for the CSeries programme,\" said Benoit Poirier, an analyst at Desjardins Securities.\n\nThe CSeries is now targeted for a commercial debut in the second half of 2015, following Bombardier's Jan 16 announcement that more time was needed to complete flight tests. The plane is designed to seat 108 to 160 people. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/2c74b8f77faac52473c064e1b5dd3dba3ad04bd5adad3d19b411f3441a1337d3?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Struggling to take off: Orders for Bombardier's CSeries haven't met the planemaker's target, and few major airlines have embraced a jet that the company bills as a challenger to Boeing Co and Airbus Group NV aircraft. - PHOTO: BLOOMBERG"}]}

By AMIT ROY CHOUDHURY\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jun 1, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nDIGITAL Realty, the world's largest provider of data centre (DC) real estate services, is benefiting from the ubiquitous growth of cloud computing in the Asia-Pacific region. Last year, Asia-Pacific's share of the company's global revenue grew to 4 per cent, up from one per cent in 2012, which was a very meaningful shift. In the first quarter of this year, more than 30 per cent of the company's incremental revenue came from Asia-Pacific.\n\nDigital Realty doesn't compete in the area of software or hardware that make up a DC. Instead, it provides the physical infrastructure, including cooling, power and connectivity for DCs. A typical Digital Realty facility could have several DCs co-located on the premises.\n\nA William Stein, Digital Realty's interim CEO and CFO, is bullish about the region. He told BizIT: \"This is an exciting region in its nascent (growth) period now, and it has continued to evolve very rapidly. Technology shifts in the region also ensure that there are more years of growth to come in future.\"\n\nA recent report by Frost & Sullivan noted that the Singapore DC market is expected to more than double from US$223 million in 2010 to US$550 million in 2017, at a compound annual growth rate of 13.8 per cent.\n\n'Prominent pivot'\n\nSingapore is an important centre and Mr Stein is quite definite that the company will continue to invest here in coming years. \"It's been a great market for us and we continue to look at it as a prominent pivot in our global geography.\"\n\nIn Singapore, the company has invested more than US$300 million to date, Mr Stein noted. \"We will continue to make these investments as demand increases. We are near capacity with our very large data centre in Jurong, and as we reach full capacity in the near future, we will continue to invest and develop the data centre capacity in this market.\"\n\nMr Stein noted that besides Singapore, the company also sees Australia and Hong Kong as key markets. \"We are also in Japan, with a site in Osaka, where we will have a fully finished data centre next year and we will continue to move into other cities in Japan, such as Tokyo. We see phenomenal growth prospects in this market. In addition to that, we're observing emerging markets in Asia-Pacific, which we will enter when the time is right and when market conditions make sense for us.\"\n\nIn September last year, the company announced that it had completed the acquisition of a 15,000-square-metre site in Osaka for US$10.5 million.\n\nCommenting on the notion that Singapore could become a DC hub for the region, Mr Stein noted that the DC investment level is already very high in the country.\n\nHe, however, added that it's quite unlikely that any one country will become the DC hub for Asia-Pacific given that there is growth across the region. \"Oftentimes, you could create bottlenecks in your own traffic and data transmission if you try to get everything consolidated in one part of the region. So by the nature of data proliferation and businesses thriving in different geographies, we will start to see decentralisation in parts of Asia-Pacific, and not so much a hub and spoke DC model in the region.\"\n\nIn terms of investment, there are many business models and ways of building DCs. Mr Stein said his company has, over the past 10 to 12 years, \"perfected\" how it develops DCs having created the third generation of its POD Architecture.\n\nRegional realities\n\n\"Our DCs are built in a very energy-efficient manner, and in sizes that suit our customers' requirements. This won't change dramatically going forward. We may have to tweak the way we put our products in place, but that varies region by region. For example, Singapore, being constrained by real estate, will have more vertical builds where we will maximise the amount of land we use for building our DCs. However, we're still more driven by the power requirements and the IT load, than we are by physical floor space.\"\n\nMr Stein said DCs are starting to become ubiquitous in the way they are being located geography by geography. There will come a time where we will not notice them as they will become commonplace as the switching exchange of the future. We also see this powerhouse of data being very meaningful to businesses. Companies leveraging on the advantages of data technology will be winners in the years ahead, he added.\n\n\"For Digital Realty, the next five years present a huge opportunity. We've evolved substantially over the past 10 years and grown more than 10-fold. In Asia-Pacific, we've grown quite substantially.\"\n\n\"We have more than 80 professionals across the region now. We expect to see that continue. At the same time, we will need to be smarter about how we meet our customer's needs in how we help them drive their growth and profitability across the region and the world,\" said Mr Stein.\n\namit@sph.com.sg\n\n@AmitRoyCBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And the 2006 World Cup in Germany saw just a 7.5 per cent fall.\n\nOne would have to go all the way back to 2002 to find a worse return during the World Cup period. That year, STI shares traded fell a whopping 45 per cent in volume compared to the year's average.\n\nBut that was no surprise; the 2002 World Cup was held in Japan and South Korea - countries with time zones similar to Singapore's.\n\nGiven that World Cup matches are typically held from afternoon all the way into the night, the 2002 World Cup was a fantastic excuse to take the month off.\n\nAnd while match timings this year are in the wee hours, that has not deterred fans from catching the games.\n\nA lot of people are taking vacations in this summertime period and travelling to London or the USA, where the timings for the games are better, said Mr Foy.\n\n\"We are seeing a lot of empty desks,\" he said, noting that his office was around 30 per cent emptier than usual.\n\nThe USA fan, who missed his team's loss to Germany yesterday morning, added that he would probably stay up and catch the round of 16 match with Belgium next week.\n\nSo should traders sell in May and go away to watch the World Cup in June?\n\nThis may prove to be a wise choice, if you examine returns during the 2002 World Cup and this year's World Cup so far.\n\nThe 2002 World Cup period coincided with a precipitous market downturn.\n\nGlobal stocks, represented by the MSCI World Index, fell 6 per cent during the World Cup period. Considering how global stocks fell 20 per cent the entire year - or roughly 2 per cent a month - the 2002 World Cup period was a bad time to stay long on the market.\n\nSimilarly this year, the STI is down about one per cent so far in this World Cup, compared to a 4 per cent gain year-to-date.\n\nBut STI traders who took a vacation during the World Cups of 2006 and 2010 missed out.\n\nDespite a 15 per cent fall in volume that year during the tournament, STI stocks gained 4.3 per cent during that period, compared to 13.3 per cent for the entire year.\n\nIn short, traders could have made a third of the year's return in just one month in 2010.\n\nIn 2006, stocks also did better on average during the World Cup month, though less significantly so. They returned 4.6 per cent during the tournament, compared to 30 per cent for the year. So traders who went back to work were rewarded.\n\nFundamentally, however, the World Cup is not likely to play much of a difference on a mid- to long-term basis as performance still depends on the stocks, said Terence Wong, DMG & Partners head of research.\n\nOCBC head of investment research Carmen Lee also noted that the June period usually sees a decline in trading activity, even without the World Cup, as it coincides with the mid-year school holidays.\n\nWhile Singapore traders may like staying away from the market during the June-July World Cup season, those trading the MSCI World Index are more indifferent.\n\nPeople trade the index whether there is a World Cup going on or not, and volumes do not necessarily fall during the summer season.\n\nAnd for those who trade the index, returns are generally better during the World Cup month compared to an average month in that year.\n\nAs much as World Cup organiser Fifa expects record television audiences around the world - an average of 188.4 million per match was recorded in 2010 - not everybody in the world cares about the World Cup.\n\nThe Economist magazine noted in an article earlier in June that football is not a big preoccupation in the world's largest nations. The US has its own version of \"football\", on top of basketball, baseball and ice hockey among its top-watched sports. India is obsessed with cricket. And can you name a famous Chinese football team? Is Yao Ming a footballer?\n\nSo if you are more globally inclined and like the MSCI World Index, buy before the World Cup starts and go on a holiday; sell when you come back. For four of the last five World Cups, except for 2002, you would have beaten the monthly averages.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

How does your organisation handle political risks?\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jun 1, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nPinaki Rath\n\nManaging Director\n\nGold Matrix Resources Pte Ltd\n\nDESPITE the political uncertainties in Thailand in the recent past, we at Gold Matrix have continued to invest there. By doing so, we have created immense goodwill which can only help our business in the long term. Admittedly, we have faced some problems but nothing that can break our resolve. Rather, it has been business as usual. There are smaller issues around commuting during the political demonstrations. Also, the province where our factory is located is a stronghold of the ''yellow-shirts'' brigade, which means that we have to live with absenteeism during the days when there had been demonstrations. That aside, we have faced no problems in dealing with the government machinery despite the political stalemate and the subsequent military coup. The wisest thing is to take insurance cover to mitigate the political risks but we are deterred by the prohibitive costs from doing so for Thailand. As a foreign investor, we tend to keep a low profile as we all well know the perils of collateral damage. Case in point is how the Taiwanese companies were mistakenly targeted for Chinese companies by miscreants in Vietnam during the recent riots there.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPLAN-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\nA COMPANY which I am involved in as a board member and senior adviser has been working on a project with the Thai government for some time now. It was at an advanced stage of negotiation and the contract would have been signed - had it not been for the removal of Prime Minister Yingluck and the ensuing military coup.\n\nThis is an example of how businesses can be negatively impacted when a country is plunged into political turmoil. There will always be an impact on business whenever there is political upheaval; it is a question of the degree and the industry the business is in. Countries doing business in Asean must pay particular attention to political and country risks.\n\nThailand has had a chequered political history. Businesses and the people are used to coups, of which there had been 12 since 1932 - an average of one in seven years. Although the frequency is high, the Thais have always been able to survive the coups. There will be short-term disruptions and hiccups to businesses, especially in the tourism sector, but the Thais have shown time and again that they have the resilience to ride out crises. The latest coup is probably the only effective and proven way for Thailand to resolve the impasse between the two opposing political parties.\n\nI hope the well tested resilience of the Thais and their pragmatism will see them through this latest crisis. In this regard, Thailand is unique. Businesses would be in a worse-off situation if the stand-off continues. At least for now, businesses can take comfort in the fact that the National Council for Peace and Order is focused on returning the country to political stability, without which business cannot be properly conducted, especially for infrastructure projects.\n\nThe company which I am involved in did expect a coup to take place - we just did not expect it to happen so soon. We tried to expedite the negotiation, but the coup beat us to it. We have also adjusted our resources in line with the situation. That said, I believe it is a temporary setback; when the situation normalises, we can expect to resume negotiation, as the country must move on and move forward.\n\nFlorence Ng\n\nManaging Director, Founder\n\nStraits Talent Pte Ltd\n\nIN our organisation, one thing is clear - no contract or business deal, regardless of its size and potential, is worth a human life. Never send any member of the staff anywhere that I myself am not prepared to be. Whether it is a military coup, potential war or terrorist zone, Sars, Mers or haze-infected area ... so long as there is a real threat to personal safety, then it is best to pull the plug on travel plans and let things calm down.\n\nThis is fundamental business-continuity planning and risk management. Yet sadly, many business leaders seem to think they and their teams are invincible. Thankfully, our business has negligible exposure to Thailand and, therefore, has not been impacted by the recent spate of heated political unrest.\n\nThat said, I personally spent an anxious four days keeping vigil as my husband had arrived in Bangkok the very day the military took over and imposed martial law. My ordeal did not end until he returned safely at the end of the week. During those four agonising days, a military coup was declared and various prominent political leaders detained. I thank the divine powers above for my husband's safe return.\n\nWhile business might have been ''as usual'', it is not without a lot of anxiety. If one really has to be in the heat of the meltdown, then extreme caution is key, as is regular communication.\n\nChristophe Duchatellier\n\nCEO\n\nAdecco Asia\n\nTHE recent crises in Thailand have prompted some concern in the country - but, for Adecco, it's business as usual with companies still operating and looking to identifying the best talent. On how our organisation handles political risks, our Thailand office has built a structured internal process where the senior team remains engaged with employers and employees regarding the changes taking place in Bangkok. Regular and timely updates are communicated to everyone, branch managers are empowered to make decisions such as early closing. The top priority for us in times like this is employee safety and security.\n\nNatalie Shuman\n\nSenior Vice-President, General Manager - EMEA & APAC\n\nKelly Services\n\nOUR business in Thailand has thrived through several episodes of political turmoil, economic crisis and natural disasters since 1995. Any impact on the business so far has been short-term, lasting one or two quarters. Our business grew 48 per cent in 2006, the year the last military intervention occurred.\n\nThailand is essentially a consistently growing economy, a regional and global manufacturing/export base for a wide variety of goods. Political turmoil has not capped natural growth momentums for long, it seems. The resilience of the Thai people is another key factor lessening the negative impact on business.\n\nIn the current scenario where the country has experienced more than six months of political instability, the majority of our clients continue to hire, albeit more conservatively. Some opt for alternative hiring solutions to serve their needs better during the crisis. Kelly offers a wide range of services and solutions to ensure that clients' talent supply chain is appropriately managed under different circumstances.\n\nThrough all the crises, it is fortunate that none of our employees have been adversely affected. We anticipate a slowdown over the next few months as the country awaits clarity from the new military administration. A gradual rebound is expected from the fourth quarter. Our business outlook continues to be positive on Thailand.\n\nChris Comer\n\nCEO\n\nCastlewood Group\n\nTHE Royal Thai Army's decision to declare a coup was inevitable considering the political instability over the past six months. I feel this is precisely the right first step for what the country needs to initiate internal peace and unity and restore confidence among stakeholders. The declaration of a coup has attracted critics, but many locals have welcomed this move as they finally see a means to an end. Thailand is renowned for its history of political instability and it is well documented that this is how the Thais signal their desire for a change in political strategy.\n\nFrom a business point of view, Castlewood Group has two projects in the region - our recently opened beach club, Nikki Beach Phuket, and our soon-to-be- opened Nikki Beach Hotel & Spa Phuket, which is in the final stages of construction. Contrary to reports of damage to tourism, our beach club is still in demand and construction of the hotel is going full steam ahead. Of course, since the volatility started six months ago, there has been a detrimental impact on tourism in parts of Thailand; however, Phuket has, in some ways, indirectly benefited from the upheaval, as the core unrest has been mainly in Bangkok.\n\nFrom an economic standpoint we must try to keep things in perspective - Thailand is South-east Asia's second biggest economy, and the last time the country experienced a military coup in 2006, the economy retracted by 1.4 per cent as a knee-jerk reaction, but then bounced back to grow 4.5 per cent from its pre-coup level. Right now, with the relaxation of curfews less than a week after they were imposed, there's a sense that calm has been restored, which proves that the military made the right decision. Tourism is the backbone of Thailand's economy, so both the locals and the military understand the importance of restoring balance.\n\nWith our operations in Thailand we are fortunate to have a team on the ground and the feedback has been positive; indeed, keeping in the theme of the Thai military leader, ''it is definitely business as usual''. Overall, there has been no direct impact on our businesses, but we make sure that we are well equipped to keep abreast of any developments and ensure that all of Castlewood's investors remain well informed. In situations like this, communication is key.\n\nPhilippe Huinck\n\nRegional Managing Director, South and South East Asia\n\nInternational SOS\n\nINTERNATIONAL SOS is advising some 22,000 members currently in Thailand or due to travel there in the next week. Most of the information requests seek our assessment of the situation and advice relevant to an organisation's specific locations and nature of operations, among other factors. We are also handling several cases relating to contingency planning and potential security and medical operational support.\n\nThrough our online membership Travel Security Online site, International SOS produces daily reporting on the issue, which contains timely validated information, our assessment and objective advice, such as:\n\nOrganisations with local offices in Bangkok should review their business continuity and crisis management plans and ensure they are able to locate and communicate with their staff in the country. For companies which have not thought about preparing their business travellers and do not have programmes in place to do so, we strongly advise them to do so now.\n\nJoshua Yim\n\nCEO\n\nAchieve Group\n\nBESIDES Singapore, we have operations in Malaysia and Hong Kong but not Thailand so the Thai political crisis has not had an impact on our business so far.\n\nCompanies that want to venture overseas should always conduct feasibility studies first. It is important to understand the lay of the land, and how stable the country is in terms of political and other factors. From there, weigh the potential risks that may occur further down the road. Having said that, business owners should note that all countries will have their own risks, even Singapore. As much as we can conduct feasibility studies and put in place certain contingencies, it is true that some risks may be unforeseen.\n\nThus, I would advocate that businesses spread their eggs in several baskets. For example, a manufacturing firm may want to consider having production facilities in two or three geographical locations so that in case one area is struck by an upheaval, there would be another facility that can continue to support the production requirements.\n\nAt Achieve Group, the nature of our recruitment and human resource consulting business is much more people-centric and we obviously operate in more mature cities. In the event that our business might be affected by a political upheaval like in Thailand, our modus operandi would be safety first for our people. We would need to lie low and instruct our people to stay away from work if need be.\n\nApart from people, the other most important element in our business is our database and confidential information of our clients so it is imperative that such information is always kept safe. These are the things we can do in our trade to mitigate such risks.\n\nMike Muller\n\nPresident, Asia Pacific\n\nAvaya\n\nTHE situation in Thailand clearly reinforces the need for businesses of all sizes to have flexibility in how they work as well as comprehensive recovery plans in place to ensure business continuity.\n\nIn an ever more mobile-centric world, employees need simple, secure access to essential collaboration tools regardless of their location or the device they are using. That means workers can be as productive on the road, at home, or at a customer's premises as they can be in the office. Video collaboration tools that people can access from any device to communicate with their team members, partners or customers as if they were face to face form an increasingly important element of this.\n\nMobile video has certainly helped the Avaya team in Thailand to stay active, productive and drive our business forward even when people are unable to get to the office. This flexibility helps not only in times of crisis. It helps many employees to work smarter and manage their professional and personal lives more effectively - whether they are parents juggling the demands of work and their kids, international business travellers or home office workers.\n\nAnd the advantages are not limited to individuals. For example, when it is not possible for workers to reach a large customer service centre with hundreds or thousands of agents helping customers resolve important queries around the clock, the ability to have those agents connect from home and still deliver that essential service, or to have a back-up facility in a secondary location, allows the business to keep functioning effectively.\n\nPolitical and environmental risks abound, across Asia Pacific and around the world - and many are completely unpredictable. Ensuring you have the right collaboration systems and back-up plans in place can make the difference between seamless business continuity and a complete suspension of operations.\n\nDora Hoan\n\nCo-Chairman / Group CEO\n\nBest World International Ltd\n\nTHE protracted crisis has severely affected consumer sentiments; they have developed a tendency to hold on to their cash. Therefore, demand for our lifestyle products, such as health supplements and skincare products, has been dampened. Fortunately, as our group's businesses are spread over many countries in Asia, we have spread our risks and avoided over-reliance on any one country. While we are sure that Thailand will bounce back from this crisis, we are adopting a wait-and-see attitude towards the market. We are also actively managing our sales to prevent losses from currency fluctuations.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The ubiquitous access of cloud infrastructure at a pay-as-you-use model has resulted in a level playing field for anyone with a great idea to experiment and start their business easily. Many young start-ups have re-defined business models with innovative solutions, created new business opportunities, and transformed the industry as they offer their solutions as a service to millions of users worldwide.\n\nCompanies that were start-ups a few years ago such as Dropbox, Pinterest, Spotify, Airbnb, Foursquare and Reddit, are now global businesses. All these start-ups have one common trait; they built their business using cloud computing services and have gone global.\n\nSuccessful start-ups are growing user base in minutes and monetising services at a phenomenal pace, while disrupting traditional enterprise business models. This is a wake-up call for enterprises to re-evaluate their status quo and assumptions.\n\nEnterprises need to seek new ways of using technology such as cloud computing to drive business growth. An increasing number of CIOs (chief information officers) are moving away from the traditional tasks of keeping the lights on for on-premises data centres or negotiating long-term contracts. The forward-looking CIOs are now taking the lead in embracing cloud computing and challenging their IT teams to think differently.\n\nAs we look at the strategies undertaken by CIOs around the world, there are seven broad IT approaches in cloud adoption:\n\nEnterprises are moving their development and test environments into the cloud to reduce deployment time and cost. One example is Galata Chemicals, a global producer of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) additives that run their disaster recovery (DR) systems on the cloud. Unlike the traditional DR systems that often have a risk window during the testing phase, Galata is able to test DR procedures on demand in the cloud without the need to rebuild the DR environment after completing tests. By running DR solution on the cloud, Galata has reduced operational cost by about 70 per cent.\n\nEnterprises can accelerate cloud adoption by starting new projects on the cloud. For example, Qantas wanted to develop an in-flight application that would aggregate and present passenger information to cabin crew to improve customer recognition captured on board the flight. Qantas started working on the application using cloud services in 2012 and was able to roll out the pilot programme to 20 people within 12 weeks.\n\nThe application is now used by nearly 1,000 cabin crew supervisors to capture incidents where a customer is not completely happy with the service they receive. The airline can then refer these situations to its customer care team to resolve proactively before the customer contacts them.\n\nAnother approach is supplementing existing applications running in data centres with cloud resources. BookMyShow, an entertainment ticketing company, uses cloud data warehouse service for fast query and analytics on huge amounts of usage data. The processed content is then integrated back to their on-premises application called Tableau for visualisation.\n\nBookMyShow has saved tens of thousands of dollars by avoiding expensive data warehouse hardware and delivered quicker recommendations for their customers.\n\nThis is the reverse of the previous strategy, where applications built on the cloud reaches back to on-premises applications for resources. Samsung's Visual Display Unit adopted this method to develop and run their Smart Hub TV application.\n\nWhen new customers subscribe to Smart Hub TV content, the financial transaction processing occurs on their on-premises systems and upon completion, content is delivered seamlessly from the cloud to their customers.\n\nIn this strategy companies have to decide which workloads to move to the cloud first and in subsequent phases. For example, Jollibee Foods Corporation migrated mission critical enterprise applications to the cloud.\n\nUsing cloud computing has streamlined its supply chain, reduced deployment time from several months to within minutes to meet all kinds of workloads and user demands.\n\nEnterprises are beginning to consolidate their DCs. For example, News Corp is in the process of consolidating 40 DCs worldwide, consisting of thousands of servers, into six DCs.\n\nThey expect to save tens of millions of dollars in on-premises infrastructure costs by moving its ERP (enterprise resource planning) system to the cloud.\n\nThis strategy requires foresight and commitment from C-level executives to move their entire IT infrastructure to the cloud, and re-focus resources on what truly matters to their business. With the top executive support to embrace cloud computing, the entire organisation becomes aligned in one single vision to accelerate business transformation.\n\nThe above strategies have helped organisations transform their business. To stay competitive in this dynamic world, it is imperative that enterprises embark on their journey to adopt cloud computing quickly.\n\nThe writer is Asia-Pacific managing director of Amazon Web Services\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/meaty-italian", "site_title": "Meaty Italian", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nMeaty Italian\n\nButtero refers to the horse-riding shepherds in Tuscany who have been herding cattle for centuries. By JAIME EE\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jun 1, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nNEW RESTAURANT\n\nButtero\n\n54 Tras Street\n\nTel: 6438-7737\n\nOpen for lunch and dinner Mon to Sat: 12pm to 3pm; 6pm to late (last order 10.30pm). Closed on Sun.\n\nIT can't be easy coming up with restaurant concepts these days, when everything from Alpine cows to New Orleans revelry have been mined to add gloss and gimmickry to garden-variety European or American cuisine.\n\nThe latest in mutton-dressed-as-continental-lamb attempts to cross our dining path is Buttero - Tras Street's tribute to the Tuscan cowboy. No, don't rack your brains trying to remember the last time you saw an Italian gunslinger in a Clint Eastwood spaghetti western - or whether cowboys ever boiled pasta at camp in-between fighting Mexican banditos. Buttero refers to horse-riding shepherds in Tuscany, who have been herding cattle and looking after livestock for centuries, and there are still some around today.\n\nIn this context, however, it's just a fancy name for an Italian restaurant which can't decide whether it's a pasta joint, grill or American diner and settles for all three. And to make sure there are no territorial disputes over the menu's origins, an Australian chef is at the helm to maintain culinary diplomacy.\n\nWhat ensues is a mishmash menu with no clear theme, although its anything-goes stance seems well-matched with its gritty-chic surroundings by Australian designer Barry Polson. Not quite cowboy, not quite Italian but tastefully funky, it stands out for its impressive wood-panelled open kitchen, quirky wall features and bathroom fixtures, and the large mural of an evil-faced pig-tailed girl by street artist Caratoes on the wall in front.\n\nWhether intentional or not, the menu looks like a cheap diner menu in big font and loud colours, divided simply into sweets, pastas, entrees (appetisers), large plates (namely the grill items) and sides.\n\nThe starters, though, are sadly middling. A simple caprese salad ($21) promises a pop of Mediterranean flavour with heirloom tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella and basil but is instead muddled with the addition of hard chunks of fried cornbread with a vague porkiness that distract from the already bland tomato and cheese combo. An intriguing-sounding raw black kingfish soldiers ($20) seems too much like an uneasy Japanese-Middle Eastern coupling, with sashimi slices marinated in olive oil and sliced chilli that you wrap in a stodgy chickpea blini. Even the pleasant sweet pickled fennel cannot strike a flavourful deal between the two.\n\nFaring a little better is the crumbed veal taco ($19) - a crunchy patty of shredded (slightly mushy) veal packed into a soft taco shell, offering a satisfying mouthful of corn pancake, crunchy meat patty and sweet acidity of cabbage apple slaw to counter the richness.\n\nAs for the pastas, the pappardelle spanner crab ($25) is what happens when a Tuscan cowboy starts whipping up his famous noodles with tomato sauce and forgets that, being in the livestock business, he has no crab. So good luck trying to find any in this so-so melange of wide pasta strips tossed in basic tomato sauce. A \"black and white\" pasta ($24) of squid ink and regular noodles in clam sauce also falls short. And unless you've had some dental work done, skip the mush balls posing as house-made gnocchi ($21) and just eat the nicely grilled Brussels sprouts bathed in a citrus honey dressing.\n\nThat said, Buttero fares best when it sticks to what its name represents. Chef Logan Campbell (incidentally one of the most well-mannered chefs we've come across) shows a stronger affinity with meats, especially from the grill. He does a pretty good porchetta ($32) using rolled pork loin with skin that falls a little short of crispy but is nonetheless meaty and tender with a good whiff of its herb rub. Braised beans round off this hearty main.\n\nThe dirty steak is probably the best item on the menu ($34) - a flatiron steak is done rare between its charred exterior but yields tender, flavourful meat. Zesty salsa verde with yoghurt and a brown sauce make for a tangy trio and proves there's potential for this place. That and the waffle fries, which are not to be missed.\n\nWe also like most of the desserts. Not so much the sandy textured cannoli filled with powdery cream, but the light vanilla panna cotta ($12) with super sweet nutty meringue cookie, strawberries and passion fruit, and the sticky chewy chocolate pot ($12) topped with vanilla foam scented with rosemary and served with a delicate crisp puff pastry stick on the side.\n\nBesides a refining of menu, Buttero could also use a bit of a kick in the service side, which is haphazard although well-meaning, and an inhouse soundtrack with more than one solitary song that loops repeatedly as if they don't expect anyone to notice.\n\nIt's hard to tell on a packed Tuesday which is half-price wine night, but like cowboys who know when a calf is missing from their herd, little things can make a difference.\n\nOverall rating:\n\n6\n\njaime@sph.com.sg\n\n@JaimeEeBT\n\nWHAT OUR RATINGS MEAN\n\n10: The ultimate dining experience 9-9.5: Sublime 8-8.5: Excellent 7-7.5: Good to very good 6-6.5: Promising 5-5.5: Average\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By YVONNE GOH\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jun 1, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIN the corporate world, it has long been the norm to have procedures for regular appraisal or evaluation of both staff and departments at various levels throughout the organisation.\n\nIt is only logical that the board of directors - being the highest governing body of a company which controls major resources, both financial and human - should also be subjected to a regular evaluation process.\n\nThe Singapore Code of Corporate Governance states that: \"There should be a formal annual assessment of the effectiveness of the board as a whole and its board committees and the contribution by each director to the effectiveness of the board.\"\n\nIt is also recommended that a write-up of the board evaluation process be included in the company's annual report.\n\nThe process\n\nBoard evaluations are typically based around directors rating themselves, the other directors and the collective board, as well as the three principal committees (Audit, Nomination and Remuneration). This rating is done on a series of questions related to their responsibilities and functions as a board.\n\nThe results of this rating are then compiled and analysed and a report delivered to the Nominating Committee or the board.\n\nThere are two basic areas to look at in board evaluation: people factors and process factors. People factors tend to be by far the more important of the two in achieving an effective board.\n\nOn the people front, questions that should be asked include: How do the directors work as a team; what are their interpersonal skills; and is there a dominant chairman or CEO.\n\nProcess factors deal with things such as whether appropriate, timely and unbiased information, of the right length and quality, is provided to the board; whether there are sufficient board and committee meetings; and if they are conducted in a manner that ensures open communication, meaningful participation and timely resolution of issues.\n\nOver-arching the people and process questions are those which are broader and more strategic. Questions such as:\n\nEnsuring effectiveness\n\nFor the exercise to be of value, there should be a firm commitment and belief that formal annual evaluations and follow through of findings would go a long way to helping the board improve its own performance.\n\nTherefore, serious thought and adequate time should be put into answering the questionnaires. Honesty is also important. To that end, directors are encouraged to articulate their views to support or justify the ratings they provide.\n\nWell conducted evaluations have the potential to achieve various benefits, among other things, helping the board to:\n\nBased on the results of the evaluation, a work programme incorporating recommendations that are to be undertaken, specifying who are responsible for which recommendations and the deadline for the recommendations to be implemented should be developed.\n\nThis provides a formal accountability and project plan for the board, which is more likely to result in the recommendations being put into action.\n\nIn practice\n\nIn Singapore, board evaluation is typically done on the board as a whole. Self and peer evaluations are avoided, probably because of our Asian culture which treasures politeness, humility and avoidance of conflict.\n\nWhat is also not usually done is an evaluation of each director by the board chairman and of the board chairman by the directors. This, in my view, should be undertaken as boards mature.\n\nThe engagement of external facilitators and professional consultants to gather and analyse the findings can help to instill greater discipline and improve objectivity in the process. However, this is not normally done due primarily to cost considerations.\n\nThe most recent SID-SGX Board of Directors Survey 2013, which polled listed companies in Singapore, showed that there has been a shift from results-oriented emphasis of performance criteria towards more process-oriented factors when appraising boards.\n\nThe main challenge faced by boards in executing board assessment is the perceived challenge of having a rigorous process to pursue substance over form.\n\nTo further raise the level of corporate governance, transparency and accountability in Singapore, it is time to enhance the rigours of board evaluation by introducing some of these steps.\n\nThe writer is the second vice-chairman of the Singapore Institute of Directors\n\nFor more articles, go to\n\nbtd.sg/BMatters\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Mr Lee added that efforts to promote multiracial harmony and assimilate new citizens with the mainstream of society also need to continue as society evolves and becomes more diverse.\n\nHe shared the Singapore story to highlight the need for mayors and city leaders to share the different approaches in overcoming challenges faced by cities, especially rapidly emerging cities in Asia.\n\nAt the forum's fifth edition, the participants discussed the importance of good governance and community engagement, and how smart technologies will contribute to urban development, said a statement issued by the World Cities Summit.\n\n\"Passion and people involvement are key . . . unless the people feel connected and proud, it's not much use,\" said Damon Thomas, lord mayor of the city of Hobart, Australia.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They have realised that putting up a good digital \"storefront\" requires rethinking the underlying software on the server side.\n\nBefore, most efforts to redesign customer-facing software would have focused on facelifting the front interface. Now, companies are investing more resources in getting their software to work on more devices, from browsers on desktops to mobile devices.\n\nFor e-commerce, especially, this is crucial, given the rising transaction volumes performed over mobile phones and tablets, he said.\n\nAccording to a study conducted by Nielsen in September 2013, South-east Asians spend an average of more than three hours per day on smartphones.\n\nAnd nearly 530 million smartphones were sold across the Asia-Pacific in 2013, said research firm IDC. This made up 52 per cent of the total global shipping volume. \"People are realising that getting mobile right is a back-end challenge, not a front-end one,\" he said.\n\nCustomers are expecting mobile sites and apps to be as robust as desktop versions because they are getting accustomed to transacting fully on the mobile.\n\nTo allow mobile software to retrieve data and work with back-end payment systems smoothly, the back-end software needs to be more modular, Mr McCarthy explained.\n\nOlder software and databases tended to organise information into unmovable blocks. Newer databases and systems are not structured so rigidly; by allowing data and processes to be organised in modules, a transaction can be \"handed over\" easily from the front-end ordering system, to payment, to the warehouse for delivery.\n\nThis is where natively digital firms, such as dotcom e-commerce players, are giving larger, traditional firms a run for their money, he pointed out.\n\nSingapore cosmetics e-tailer Luxola, for example, has a system that tracks what users buy. For items that are purchased on a regular basis, it will push reminders and recommended items, to raise the potential final basket size and keep users coming back. These online players are showing end-users the power of crunching data; traditional firms are left hamstrung because they sunk costs into older systems that cannot be ripped out and replaced, he said.\n\nTo compound the effect, dotcoms that are already built on modular architectures can release software upgrades by the hundreds per year. Older firms are accustomed to upgrading their back-end systems several times a decade, in contrast, said Mr McCarthy.\n\n\"Customers are evolving faster than companies can catch up with. That's why firms are writing huge cheques for digital transformations, because they have so many legacy systems,\" he added.\n\nAnd, it is not just digital retailers that need to consider their customer software strategies. Banks and airlines, for example, rely increasingly on customer-facing websites and mobile apps to serve customers.\n\n\"You have a few minutes to engage. If you turn a customer off, you'll have a hell of a time getting them back,\" Mr McCarthy says.\n\nThe leaders in the space are trying their best to cut the number of clicks that a user has to do. He pointed to taxi-calling app Uber, saying that the entire transaction from identifying your location to getting the cab can be accomplished within five clicks.\n\nFor banks and firms offering a large spread of services, they can start stripping down their sites by breaking down the range of services offered into smaller standalone apps.\n\nThis allows customers to be funnelled into light, express versions of their frequently used services, reducing the friction of transacting with the main \"heavy\" site, he said.\n\nThese mobile apps are generating about five to 10 times the traffic that the larger website does, because of that convenience, he said. He pointed to the example of traditional railway companies which display train timetables on the site. For the average customer, an information-laden site with timetables is not ideal.\n\n\"The customer just wants to go home, or go to work. If the back-end can figure out what 'home' means to the individual and display travel times from start to end, the site is a lot more useful and simple,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Forrester figures, building these new systems will represent US$1 trillion in IT spending by 2017. Based on his experience of working with large firms, he estimates that just 10 per cent to 15 per cent of companies are doing well in providing good software. About 30 per cent are doing a decent job.\"The rest - the 50 per cent - are holding on for dear life,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Then you'll see people in the streets,\" said Rogerio Souza, a fan in Sao Paulo, although he warned failure would cause more discontent.\n\n\"Brazilians only count titles. No one cares about second place. If they don't win the Cup at home, you'll see the criticism rain down\".\n\nPresident Dilma Rousseff dismisses complaints about the heavy spending and delays in preparing stadiums and airports, and is betting Brazil will put on a show on and off the field.\n\n\"What I'm seeing more and more is the welcome given to the teams and the happiness of the Brazilian people with our team,\" she said in a speech on Wednesday.\n\nYet the list of possible problems is long. In fact, hosting a successful World Cup may ultimately prove harder for Brazil than winning it.\n\nThe main risk, for both fans and the government, appears to be violent street demonstrations.\n\nProtests and labour strikes are planned in the 12 host cities, including a 24-hour slowdown by some airport workers in Rio de Janeiro although the threat of a long subway strike in Sao Paulo has eased.\n\nSome businesses in Rio, the venue for seven Cup games including the final, had boarded up windows and doors by late on Wednesday in case protests erupted.\n\nOfficials privately expressed fears that protests and traffic problems meant that some fans would still be stuck outside the Arena Corinthians in Sao Paulo when the opening match started.\n\nThe government had decreed a partial holiday yesterday to help ease congestion. Still, a long list of VIPs including 10 heads of state and senior officials from world soccer body Fifa meant traffic was still likely to be complicated.\n\nThe stadium itself has been a source of anxiety.\n\nNot only was it delivered six months late at a cost of US$525 million, about US$150 million over budget, but because of the delays the opening game this morning was to be the facility's first at full capacity.\n\nThat's a big no-no in the field of logistics and a violation of Fifa's normal protocol for World Cup games.\n\n\"I'm praying that nothing goes wrong,\" said Lizbeth Silva, a clerical worker at a Sao Paulo school. \"You hear about all these problems, but you still want to root for Brazil.\"\n\nThe stakes for Brazil go well beyond the World Cup itself.\n\nMs Rousseff is running for re-election in October, and a rough tournament would likely cause her popularity, already under duress, to fall further.\n\nPolls show she currently holds a lead of about 10 percentage points over her likely rival if the vote goes to a second round, as most expect.\n\nAny major logistical problems and unrest could also further dent Brazil's reputation among investors, which has suffered since a decade-long economic boom fizzled under Ms Rousseff.\n\nBrazil's team, led by its exciting 22-year-old star striker Neymar, were heavily favoured to beat Croatia.\n\nAs the tournament progresses, the fervour of foreign fans, hordes of whom have already descended upon host cities, could also help ease any tension among Brazilians themselves.\n\nOutside Rio's Maracana stadium on Wednesday, Brazilians cheered and whistled as an SUV with a Colombian flag draped atop it stopped at a red light.\n\n\"We wouldn't miss this for the world,\" said the driver, adding that he and his three passengers left Colombia by road nearly three weeks ago. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

The 60,500 vacancies in March also made up 3 per cent of total labour demand, up from 2.6 per cent a year ago.\n\nThere is some consolation in the fact that there are now more job seekers chasing jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 2 per cent in March, and stood at a higher 2.9 per cent for residents. In the Ministry of Manpower's (MOM) view, this reflects how more residents (particularly less educated ones) have been encouraged by the greater availability of jobs and higher wages to get back into the labour market.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

As early as December 2012, Lyxor began to switch some physical and swap-replicated European bond ETFs to a physical-only mechanism.\n\nThe industry shift reflects higher concerns about risks from investors after the global financial crisis. Because synthetic ETFs' returns hinge on derivative or swap agreements, ETF investors are exposed to the risk that whoever provided those swaps or derivative contracts may not be able to pay up.\n\nIn fact, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (Iosco) in 2013 recommended that regulators address counterparty risks of ETFs.\n\nPhysical replication, in which the fund holds the actual assets being tracked by its underlying index, does not face such counterparty risk.\n\nBut the use of physical replication tended to be restricted to simple indices whose assets could be easily traded. For benchmarks such as global or emerging indices, however, synthetic replication gained a stronger foothold because it allowed ETF providers to more efficiently track indices that are not as liquid or harder to access. For such cases, tracking error, or the ability of the index to accurately depict the performing of the underlying index, was better and costs were often lower as well.\n\nOnline trade journal ETFtrends.com noted that when Deutsche switched its Euro Stoxx 50 ETF to physical replication, the fund's expense ratio increased to 0.09 per cent from zero.\n\nDeutsche said on Friday that the conversion will not affect the total expense ratios for the Singapore-listed ETFs.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

From tablets to 2-in-1 devices, desktop to AIO PCs, we are experiencing a level of innovation never seen before.\"\n\nHe added that this year is going to be exciting for consumers. \"Intel has and will continue to drive the evolution of the PC with our partners to provide low-power, high-performance devices.\"\n\nAmong the more interesting devices launched by Dell are a pair of ruggedised machines, the Latitude 14 Rugged Extreme notebook and the Latitude 12 Rugged Extreme convertible notebook. Both are powerful machines built to function in the harshest of conditions.\n\nConstructed with robust materials, including impact-resistant ultra-polymers and sturdy magnesium alloy, these systems are built to withstand hazards such as dust, moisture, drops, vibration, extreme temperatures and other conditions faced by users in military, public safety, manufacturing or industrial settings. However, they do not come cheap. The Latitude 12 Rugged Extreme has a starting price of $5,580 while the Latitude 14 Rugged Extreme starts from $4,600.\n\nFor those who require computing power to run graphic and data-intensive workloads on the move, Dell has introduced the new 15\" Dell Precision M2800 mobile workstation that, it claims, breaks cost barriers with workstation-class performance. Prices start from $2,018 excluding GST.\n\nDell also introduced two ultrasharp 4K monitors, the 32-inch UP3214Q and the 24-inch UP2414Q. The UP3214Q costs $4,949 while its smaller sibling UP2414Q costs $1,599.\n\nThe company also announced the availability of the OptiPlex9030 and OptiPlex3030 AIOs. Interestingly, more than 10 per cent of the device's chassis comprises recycled technological products, making it a leading product in the green effort.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In this context, MediShield Life has emerged as a welcome addition to Singapore's healthcare financing framework. Based on the recommendations of a review committee, the scheme will result in higher payouts and, consequently, lower out-of-pocket expenses for CPF members. This is thanks to bigger claim limits for a number of benefits such as ward costs, surgical procedures and outpatient cancer therapy. The removal of the age limit of 90 also enables the plan to offer life-long coverage, a boon at a time when people are living longer. Significantly, it steps into the breach to cover those with pre-existing illnesses, who today may suffer huge premium loadings or may be rejected by insurers outright.\n\nPremiums are yet to be announced but already, there are assurances that they will be affordable. It is most likely that premiums can be funded by Medisave contributions. CPF members will have to take stock of their healthcare coverage. They are likely to question if they still need a private Integrated Shield plan. Premiums of private Shield plans were raised significantly last year. But those thinking of cancelling their plans should think twice. MediShield Life is structured as a catastrophic plan, unlike private Shield plans where benefits are paid on an \"as charged\" basis. Based on illustrations, MediShield Life could potentially cover as much as half of a large hospital bill. But the examples feature heavily subsidised B2 wards. Members should calibrate their expectations of benefits such as the choice of a private hospital or a Class A ward, alongside their insurance cover. A mismatch can be extremely costly.\n\nMeanwhile, it is worth contemplating a portable medical scheme, as advocated by NTUC. At the moment, much duplication exists. Companies provide group cover for their staff, who in turn continue to pay for MediShield and private Shield plans that they are unlikely to claim on while they are employed. There exist a number of schemes where employers can make an additional contribution to employees' Medisave accounts, or pay the premiums of a Shield plan on employees' behalf. As the take-up of the schemes is reportedly poor, a tax incentive as suggested by NTUC may help. Certainly, small and medium enterprises in particular may benefit, as their company size and budget may limit their choice of a group plan.\n\nTo be sure, Singaporeans have good reasons to fret about healthcare costs. An ageing population means that medical expenses are likely to rise exponentially along with chronic illnesses. Many households do not qualify for heavily subsidised wards. Estimates of medical inflation of between 5 and 10 per cent are significantly higher than goods inflation, and costs at private hospitals are expected to rise at an even more rapid clip. Insurance is a must as a means to hedge this risk, but there is also the risk - as private Shield policyholders have recently seen - that premiums could rise to unaffordable levels. One way to ease this spiral is to encourage healthy living. Insurers can do their bit by offering no-claims discounts, for instance, similar to motor insurance. The responsibility for healthcare ultimately lies with individuals but every bit of help goes a long way.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The cab booking line is constantly engaged, and there are no taxis in sight anywhere. You begin to fret.\n\nGetting a car from Uber could have saved you that morning anguish. Think of Uber as a private driver service - all it takes is one button on the app to get a car to get you from point A to point B. The service started in San Francisco four years ago and is now available in about 140 cities worldwide.\n\nHere's how it works: Download the app, and register your particulars, including your credit card details, and select the pick-up location. The app shows how long a wait for a car will be. The wait for a car tends to be shorter in the CBD area where there are more cars available, whereas in the heartlands, the wait can be 15 minutes long.\n\nCustomers have two choices when it comes to the type of car they want. The UberExec which has a more premium range of cars, such as Porsche Panamera, BMW 5-Series and Mercedes Benz E-Class. The base fare for a trip is $7, plus $0.45/min and $1.95/km.\n\nThen, there is the lower-priced option, UberX, which uses cars such as Toyota Corolla, Nissan Sunny and Mitsubishi Lancer. The base fare for a trip is $3.50, plus $0.40/min and $0.70/km.\n\nWithin minutes of booking a car, the driver calls to confirm your pick-up location, and turns up during the said time. You can also track the car's movement through the app. Hop into the car, get to point B, and head straight out to your event. There is no need to fumble for small change, as the fare is charged to the customer's credit card. A receipt is later emailed to the customer.\n\nMichael Brown, Uber's regional manager says that Uber offers convenience. \"Usually, it is only a five-minute wait for a car in the CBD, and you don't have to worry about parking. And there is no need to book in advance, either.\"\n\nRegardless of the time of day, Mr Brown says that customers don't have to fret about not being able to get a car. During peak hours, as demand for cars start to increase, Uber's surge pricing kicks in. Fares will go up, based on an algorithm. Customers have the ability to use the app's fare quote option which will show how much more they will have to pay compared to a non-peak hour ride.\n\nCustomers have the option of choosing to wait, or to pay more, \"and they will be guaranteed a car\", says Mr Brown. Price surge ends when the demand has been met, and customers pay the original rate.\n\nMr Brown says that apart from convenience, customers are assured accountability and safety whenever they take a ride with Uber. Drivers are given a rating by customers, and errant drivers are known to have been removed from Uber's list.\n\nAnd while Uber cars appear like private ones, \"it won't be someone who is driving your grandmother's car that is coming to pick you up,\" he says.\n\nMr Brown says all Uber cars are commercially registered with the Land Transport Authority, and drivers are either employees or owners of limousine companies. He declined to disclose how many Uber drivers there are in Singapore, and would only say, \"we have many hundreds\".\n\nHe adds that while the price of a ride is about 1.5 to 2.5 times more than a regular cab, the Uber service is popular with those who have more disposable income and who want the convenience of a private driver.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

From micro-managing the outfits of the bridal party to confiscating the phones of guests, the probably borderline-OCD rapper gives new meaning to the term \"groomzilla\".

It's also his special day and he should spend on things for the wedding that he likes.\"\n\nTo meet the demand of a growing clientele of grooms, Leslie Chia, founder and creative director of bespoke menswear label PIMABS introduced wedding packages as part of his range of services in 2006, with prices starting from $1,450 for a five-piece ensemble.\n\n\"The majority of my clients then just made their suits with me and did the styling themselves or with the bridal boutiques,\" relates Mr Chia. \"More often than not, they will all look the same in a black suit or tux and a cravat or ascot. It's too traditional for my liking. Hence, I created a package that is flexible, with a suit or a tux plus two dress shirts and some accessories like bowties and pocket squares.\"\n\nLast year, such packages made up 13 per cent of total sales for the Boat Quay- based atelier, excluding suits that were made for weddings but not part of a package.\n\n\"Realistically, we can't beat the prices of existing wedding boutiques that provide those quick-and-easy packages,\" admits Daniel Loh, co-founder and executive creative director of men's and women's bespoke tailoring brand The Assembly Co, which is located along the stretch of Tanjong Pagar populated by several bridal studios. \"But compared to these boutiques, which offer only suit rentals, we're offering something that cannot be found off the rack and can be owned after.\"\n\nMr Loh, who is also the co-founder of homegrown womenswear label Saturday and designer for the brand until 2012, attributes about 10 per cent of sales to wedding day outfits - which start from $599 for a fused suit. He also notes that more men are taking the initiative when it comes to their look for the big day, rather than allowing their fiances to dictate their outfits.\n\n\"Some of them are as particular as their wives,\" adds Mr Loh, whose business also includes a manufacturing facility for the production of ready-to-wear apparel and uniforms. \"There was this one groom who had his mind set on not wearing a suit for his beach wedding and didn't like the idea of wearing one, ever. So he presented very thorough research with tonnes of image references, from the palette that coordinated with the decor, to a simple sketch he had drawn up, down to the individual styling of his groomsmen and the shoes they'd be wearing.\"\n\nSimilarly, Mr Chia has clients who were very specific about their get-ups - including one who was clad in an aubergine tuxedo with square shawl lapels for a masquerade-themed wedding, and another who pulled off a \"wild pink\" velvet suit. Recently, the designer created three tuxedos, a linen day suit and a mandarin-collared jacket for the wedding of just one client - Sean Lee, a Singapore-based businessman who tied the knot with Taiwanese singer Vivian Hsu.\n\nMr Loh also recalls creating bold designs for several grooms, including neon, or fully embroidered or floral liveries, as well as crafting unusual details such as ruffles and multiple pleats.\n\nHowever, for Dylan Chong, a second-generation tailor whose menswear label Dylan & Son is based in Telok Ayer, the classic black tuxedo is the last word in wedding day chic.\n\n\"There might be slight updates here and there in terms of lapel sizes and shades, but the core always remains unchanged,\" says Mr Chong. He adds that 20 to 30 per cent of his business comes from wedding commissions. \"And there is a reason they remain unchanged. You just need to remember, James Bond charmed countless ladies in it. If it's good enough for Bond, it's good enough for you.\"\n\nLike Mr Chong, groom-to-be Mr Tan has opted for a tuxedo to go with the 1920s theme of his wedding. \"I felt that since I'm going to be in a tuxedo, I might as well get it tailored. It might cost slightly more than those off the rack, but I know that it'll fit me very well,\" says the 34-year-old. \"Also, since I'm spending quite a bit of money getting a tuxedo, I wanted to have something different, so that it'll be unique to me, and working with a tailor gave me the chance to do just that.\"\n\nAnd although more men have a sense of what they like for their wedding attire, those who are clueless or need a little expert guidance could depend on these new-generation suit-makers for advice.\n\n\"To be honest, I've had clients who come in with, say, a picture of Ryan Gosling in some emerald green suit and ask me to copy it,\" says Mr Chia. \"I would see if it works with their look first and if doesn't, I will tell them why, and offer alternatives.\"\n\nThe fashion design-trained tailor doesn't just custom-make each outfit, he styles the entire look of his client, down to the right pair of velvet tuxedo slippers.\n\n\"I would say eight out of 10 men still have no idea of what they want for their weddings,\" says Mr Chia. \"They would have an idea of the location and theme on their special day but not the look per se. It's really up to me to suggest and design how the whole look should come together.\"\n\nAnd even most grooms with their own style ideas have to contend with their significant others - the micro-managing brides. \"We have experienced a few 'bridezillas' who completely took over our fitting sessions, and tried to tell me and my master tailor how everything should be done. It sure made me feel glad to be single,\" jokes Mr Chong. \"We strongly encourage the men to consider the options, but always make the decisions themselves. They are the ones wearing the suit, so they have to feel comfortable in the final selection. Besides, no one likes an indecisive man.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Dayton's foreign population grew and so did its housing sales, rising last year at almost twice the national rate.\n\nAs the housing recovery nationwide sputters, the story of Dayton reveals a reason why: The US market is missing the sales jolt provided by immigration. Last year, the number of immigrants granted US residency - typically a requirement to get a mortgage - hit a nine-year low, according to government data. Immigrants, deterred by a weak American labour market since 2008, aren't likely to get encouragement from Congress, where support for a reform bill has mostly evaporated.\n\n\"Immigrants have a drive to become homeowners that surpasses even native-born people, and that gives them a magnified impact on home sales,\" said Chris Herbert, research director of Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \"No one knows how many immigrants will be arriving in the next few years because it depends on what the economy does and what Washington does.\"\n\nNear the end of the housing boom in 2006, about 1.26 million immigrants attained permanent US status, the most since 1991, according to government data. That number declined to 1.05 million in 2007 as the financial crisis began to unfold and tumbled to 991,000 last year.\n\nThe decline in newcomers has been a drag on the nation's real estate recovery because they typically account for 10 per cent of all home sales and 15 per cent of first-time purchases, Mr Herbert said. The drop is also hurting homebuilders by worsening a shortage of construction workers, said Lawrence Yun, the chief economist for the National Association of Realtors (NAR).\n\n\"More people moving to the US means more housing demand, so any change in immigration patterns is going to have an effect on the housing market,\" said Mr Yun. \"It's also a critical part of the homebuilding market, because when you look at any construction site, you see a disproportionate amount of immigrants working there.\"\n\nImmigrants typically need a \"green card\", which gives them the right to stay and work in the US permanently, to get a mortgage, Mr Herbert said. Lenders' stiffer credit standards and rising home prices have also restrained home sales.\n\nApplications for mortgages to purchase homes in the week ending June 20 were down 18 per cent from a year earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. There were two million sales of new and existing homes in the first five months of this year, down 6.3 per cent from a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nSales of existing homes in May climbed 4.9 per cent to an annualised 4.89 million, the biggest gain in almost three years, after falling to an almost two-year low in March, according to NAR. For the year, sales probably will decline 3.2 per cent from 2013, according to Mr Yun.\n\nMost immigrants arrive in the US without much cash and gravitate to neighbourhoods with the cheapest housing, often full of foreclosures in need of repair, said Jacob Vigdor, a professor of public policy and economics at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.\n\n\"They don't have much money, but they have a lot of aspirations about owning homes,\" Prof Vigdor said. \"They're going to look for inexpensive properties that can be fixed up. A neighbourhood that Americans might look down on, immigrants will see as an opportunity.\"\n\nThe share of immigrants who own their homes has risen to 51 per cent from 49.8 per cent in the last 12 years, according to the Pew Research Center in Washington. During the same period, the homeownership rate for people born in America has dropped to 66.1 per cent from 68.3 per cent.\n\nUnder the immigration reform bill passed by the Senate a year ago and awaiting action in the House of Representatives, many of the almost 12 million undocumented immigrants in the US would be given a pathway to become citizens. That provision is one that many Republican lawmakers oppose.\n\nAbout three million of those legalised residents would apply for mortgages and buy homes, according to the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals in San Diego. There are a total of about 41 million immigrants in the US, both legal and unauthorised, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nLeaders of immigration reform such as Representative Luis Gutierrez said last week that the effort is dead. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said during a visit to the US-Mexico border on Saturday that she has little hope of a bill passing, \"but we never give up\".\n\n\"Immigrants bring old neighbourhoods back to life,\" said Prof Vigdor, the Duke professor. \"In all the political squabbling over immigration, that's something that seems to have been forgotten.\"\n\nCrime rates fall when immigrants move into neighbourhoods, said Prof Vigdor, author of a study of immigration in New York issued in April. Every one per cent increase in the city's foreign-born population resulted in 966 fewer crimes per year, according to Prof Vigdor. New York's influx of two million immigrants since the 1980s has increased the value of its real estate by US$188 billion - primarily in neighbourhoods that had been in decline, according to the report.\n\nLocal officials in Dayton, near where General Motors closed a factory the size of 73 football fields in 2008, are not waiting for Washington to act on immigration reform.\n\nAs part of the city's \"immigrant friendly\" marketing campaign, then-Dayton mayor Gary Leitzell travelled to Turkey in 2012 to convince a community of Ahiska Turks who were driven out of Uzbekistan by persecution to relocate to his city.\n\nMore than 2,000 of them have moved to a neighbourhood called Old North Dayton. Nan Whaley, who also supports the immigration programme, became Dayton's mayor this year. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

Its Peking University slipped one place to fifth, but three other Chinese universities entered this year's list.\n\nIn contrast, three Japanese institutions appeared to be on their way out, hovering just a few spots above the cut-off mark.\n\nEducation economist Jamil Salmi said Japanese universities were \"not hungry enough\" and had \"no sense of urgency\" in the highly-competitive global environment. \"Other Asian countries by contrast, such as China, Singapore and the Saudis, are driven and working hard to improve their results,\" he said.\n\nSingapore's close competitor in many areas, Hong Kong, was described as a \"star performer\"; six of its schools made the top 50.\n\nOther economies that were well-represented on the list were South Korea, Taiwan and India.\n\nIndia made the most progress from last year, going from having only three schools in the top 100 last year to 10 now.\n\nFive Middle East nations had universities on the list - Turkey, Iran, Israel, Istanbul and Saudi Arabia.\n\nAmong countries not faring as well was Thailand, with two schools on the list, down from last year's three; Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates, each with one school on the list last year, failed to snag a spot this time round.\n\nThirteen countries or regions had schools on the list.\n\nThe Asian rankings, which began only last year, ranked the tertiary institutions using 13 indicators across five areas - research income from industry, teaching, number of citations, research and international outlook.\n\nPhil Baty, the editor of Times Higher Education Rankings, said the scale and speed of Asia's development in higher education and research was \"staggerring\" and that the rankings reflected the rapidly changing dynamics of the continent's top schools.\n\n\"Many Asian institutions are making strong progress in the World University Rankings, but the global list remains dominated by North America and Western Europe - for now, at least.\"\n\nThe Asian rankings offer a clearer picture of Asian schools poised to mount a serious challenge to the traditional Western elite ones, he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Muslim fasting month of Ramadan started on Sunday and will end with the Eid Al-Fitr holiday at the end of July.\n\nThe rebels' Executive Office for Barqa seeks self-rule for the region also known as Cyrenaica. It occupied oil ports in eastern Libya at the end of last July, demanding an oil-revenue sharing agreement to make up for the neglect the area experienced under Muammar Gaddafi's 42-year rule.\n\nLibya, with Africa's largest oil reserves, is now producing about 300,000 barrels a day, or a fifth of its output before Gaddafi was overthrown in 2011. The loss of the country's oil production has boosted the price of Brent, a benchmark for half the world's traded crude.\n\nUnder an agreement reached on April 6, the Barqa federalists handed over control of Zueitina and Hariga, two of the four oil ports they seized a year ago. In return, they received an amnesty and the payment of salaries for defectors from Libya's Petroleum Facilities Guard who joined the rebels.\n\nThe accord calls for a second round of talks aiming at a comprehensive deal that would allow the reopening of the two remaining ports, Es Sider and Ras Lanuf.\n\nThe Barqa federalists last month threatened to cancel the April agreement in protest over the appointment as prime minister of Ahmed Maiteg, whom they see as allied with the nation's Islamists. His appointment was later withdrawn, and elections were held last week for a new Parliament.\n\nDanske Bank on June 19 raised its third-quarter forecast for Brent crude to US$107 a barrel, from US$104, on the turmoil in Iraq and the protests at oil sites in Libya.\n\n\"We expect the oil price to stay in the US$108-114 a barrel range over coming months, as it will take some definitive progress in Iran and Libya for the oil price to break below this range,\" it said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Speaking to BizIT, Mr Goh noted that four powerful trends are at play: mobile, cloud computing, Big Data and social networking. \"Collectively, these four trends comprise what research firm IDC calls the 'third platform' of IT (the first being mainframe, and the second being PC client/server) and critical to its success will be an underlying foundation of security, privacy and trust.\n\n\"The future promises to be both extremely disruptive and rich in opportunity for companies, IT professionals and IT vendors alike, creating new sets of winners across a rapidly evolving industry,\" Mr Goh said.\n\nSoftware-defined enterprises will leverage software and build new applications that harness new sources of data to redefine their strategy and drive structural changes to their advantage, he added.\n\n\"IT has never been as important to businesses as it is today, and that trend will only continue to intensify,\" he said. \"Unless IT organisations transform themselves, they face the threat of becoming completely irrelevant.\"\n\nMr Goh reckons that most Asian business will ride the generally positive growth outlook and continue to invest in building resilient infrastructure. Analyst firms such as Gartner have forecast IT spending for the Asia-Pacific region to reach US$767 billion this year, a 5.5 per cent increase from 2013.\n\n\"As investments continue, EMC expects continuing momentum in three main areas: IT transformation, big data and trusted IT,\" Mr Goh said.\n\nThe EMC chief noted that the adoption of virtualisation and cloud-based services are on the rise this year and will pave the way for a more mature IT environment where transforming applications, infrastructure and backup capabilities are critical for businesses moving in an era of mobility and business intelligence.\n\nIn a recent survey conducted by EMC, 68 per cent believed that Big Data will be a key factor in determining winners and losers in their industry. As data grows worldwide, the need for protecting it will increase tremendously. A key challenge for businesses in Asia is the development of knowledge and skills to better secure their data, Mr Goh added.\n\n\"The accelerating transition in IT means that our higher-growth markets are poised to grow faster than we expected a year ago. If we zoom into South-east Asia, we see upward growth in markets like Singapore and Malaysia and great potential for innovation in emerging markets like Vietnam and Myanmar.\"\n\nHe noted that it's still early days for the third platform. \"We believe second platform architectures will continue to be the foundation of the enterprise data centre for many years to come. We are helping customers bring down costs in managing the second platform so they can invest in the third platform. We see enormous opportunities to help enterprises transform both IT and their business.\"\n\nHe added that his company will continue to pursue this strategy through its federated business model that includes EMC Information Infrastructure or EMCii (focuses on information storage, information intelligence and information security (RSA) businesses), VMware (focuses on software-defined data centre, hybrid cloud computing and end-user computing), and Pivotal (focuses on building platforms for next generation of apps, including Big Data and fast data).\n\n\"Our businesses are strategically aligned yet each is focused on its core mission - developing the best technology and building the right partner ecosystem to best serve customers. This federated model allows us to offer best-of-breed, integrated, technology while preserving customers' ability to choose and deploy products from other IT companies.\"\n\nOne direct consequence of the paradigm shift that is taking place in IT is the exponential growth of digital information. Most enterprises are now just starting to explore the power and value inherent in the vast quantities of data being generated in today's world.\n\nMr Goh noted that EMC's recent Digital Universe study reveals that the digital universe in Singapore will grow eight times between 2013 and 2020 - from 46 exabytes to 377 exabytes.\n\n\"If the Singapore digital universe were represented by the memory in a stack of tablets, in 2013 it would have stretched four times the length of the Singapore MRT. By 2020 this would amount to 55 stacks the length of the Singapore MRT. According to the study, the number of devices or things that can be connected to the Internet in Singapore is at 2 per cent and will grow to 10 per cent by 2020. This growth is proportional to worldwide trends approaching 200 billion devices today, with 7 per cent (or 14 billion) already connected to and communicating over the Internet.\"\n\nMr Goh added that, ultimately, the growth of the digital universe means there is an ever-increasing pool of valuable data to analyse, which will give rise to new opportunities for organisations to understand customers better, improve overall customer experience and develop new revenue streams. \"To take full advantage, IT departments may need to hit the restart button on how they think about storing data when it comes to data lakes and hybrid cloud models.\"\n\nHe added that as these trends emerge, an organisation's information base will become a critical asset on the balance sheet. Businesses will be able to develop new services, improve efficiency and competitive differentiation. In the information age, data matters. The software-defined enterprise will also enable businesses with greater productivity and mobility; agility in business functions and safety in their journey towards technology adoption.\"\n\nHe noted that opportunities that the Internet of Things (IoT) will create for local and regional businesses include the creation of new value streams for customers, speeding up time to market, and responding more rapidly to customer needs.\n\nEnterprises can also capture more data about processes and products more quickly and radically to improve market agility. The IoT will also enable enterprises to see inside the business, including tracking from one end of the supply chain to the other, which will lower the cost of doing business in far-flung locales.

While futures trading of 10-year Treasuries is close to an all-time high, bond-market volume for some maturities has fallen a third in the past year. In Japan's US$9.6 trillion debt market, the benchmark note didn't trade until midday on two days last week. As a lack of liquidity in Italy caused transaction costs in the world's third-largest sovereign bond market to jump last month, Lombard Odier Asset Management helped propel an eightfold surge in Italian futures by relying more on derivatives.\n\nThe shift reflects an unintended consequence wrought by central banks, which have dropped interest rates close to zero and implemented policies such as buying debt to restore demand in economies crippled by the financial crisis. Inefficiencies in the US$100 trillion market for bonds may make investors more vulnerable to losses when yields rise from historical lows.\n\n\"Liquidity is becoming a serious issue,\" Grant Peterkin, a money manager at Lombard Odier, which oversees US$48 billion, said on June 11 from Geneva. The worry is that when investors try to exit their positions, \"there may be some kind of squeeze\".\n\nThat concern has caused investors to pour into derivatives, which are contracts based on underlying assets that can provide the same exposure without tying up as much capital.\n\nAs bond trading has slumped, the notional value of over-the-counter contracts soared fivefold in the past decade to a record US$710 trillion, based on the latest data from the Bank for International Settlements compiled by Deutsche Bank AG.\n\nThe disparity has become more pronounced as at least two dozen nations dropped benchmark rates to one per cent or less since the financial crisis, while the US Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan (BOJ) and Bank of England sapped supply by purchasing trillions of dollars of debt in unprecedented stimulus programmes.\n\nIt has also depressed yields and deprived traders of the volatility they need to profit from buying and selling bonds.\n\nYields globally have dropped by more than half in the past five years to an average of 1.78 per cent, while a gauge of implied yield fluctuations using options on Treasuries is now within 0.1 percentage point of an all-time low, according to index data compiled by Bank of America Corp.\n\nAt the same time, regulations designed to curb financial risk-taking such as the Volcker Rule and Basel III are limiting the flexibility banks have to facilitate trades for clients.\n\nDealers globally have slashed their bond inventories 75 per cent since 2007. Five of the six biggest Wall Street firms reported declines in fixed-income trading revenue last quarter.\n\n\"That has to bite and prevent dealers from supplying the balance sheet they did in the old days,\" Gregory Whiteley, who manages government debt at Los Angeles-based DoubleLine Capital LP, which oversees about US$50 billion, said on June 10. \"It's the sort of thing that rears its ugly head when it is least welcome - when it's the greatest problem.\"\n\nSome cracks emerged in Europe last month, when investors dumped Italian, Spanish and Greek debt on speculation political parties opposed to the European Union would gain seats in parliamentary elections and derail the euro area's recovery.\n\nAs the sell-off intensified and liquidity decreased, the disparity in yields of 10-year Italian bonds between buyers and sellers based on bids and offers doubled to six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, on May 23, the highest this year.\n\nTo avoid being ensnared as transaction costs increased and trading shrivelled, Lombard Odier's Mr Peterkin used futures contracts to wager on Italian notes rather than buying or selling the actual securities. He's not alone.\n\nVolume on Italian futures, which give buyers the right to purchase the nation's debt at a future date and price, has soared more than 800 per cent since trading of the contracts began in 2009, Bloomberg data show. By contrast, average daily trading in Italy's US$2.43 trillion market for government bonds, Europe's largest, has tumbled 57 per cent in the past decade, according to the Ministry of Finance.\n\n\"During times of uncertainty, investors may find it harder to trade large orders when they want to,\" Carl Norrey, the London-based head of non-liquid European government bond trading at JPMorgan Chase & Co, said on June 12. \"Some of this liquidity may be more superficial than really deep.\"\n\nTrading in Japan, the world's second-largest bond market, has virtually ground to a halt as the central bank gobbles up about 70 per cent of the interest-bearing debt sold each month. On four days last week, the benchmark 10-year note opened late.\n\nBOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda said in parliament last month in response to a lawmaker's question that while he isn't concerned that trading is drying up in the Japanese government bond market, the central bank \"will continue to watch developments in the market closely to keep it stable\".\n\nThere were no trades at all on April 14, the first time that happened since 2000. Since the end of January, yields on the bonds haven't risen above 0.654 per cent or dropped below 0.561 per cent - a band of less than 0.1 percentage point.\n\nEven in the United States, the world's deepest and most-liquid government debt market with more than US$12 trillion outstanding, buying and selling has decreased as derivatives have surged.\n\nFor 10-year note futures, a total of 140.4 million contracts have traded in the first five months of the year, approaching last year's total of 149.8 million, the most on a year-to-date basis going back to 2007, according to CME Group Inc. Weekly trading of Treasuries with maturities between seven years and 11 years has fallen to US$96.3 billion, a 32 per cent drop from a year ago, data compiled by the New York Fed show.\n\n\"This is a global phenomenon,\" Yvette Klevan, a fixed-income manager at Lazard Asset Management, which oversees about US$170 billion, said on June 11.\n\nThe decline in liquidity will lead to greater stability as more investors buy and hold rather than focusing on short-term trading, said John Serocold, a London-based senior director for market practice and regulatory policy at the International Capital Market Association, an industry lobbying group. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": []}

Few female roles are, in fact, as rich and full-bodied as Nora in Henrik Ibsen's classic play A Doll's House - the wife and mother who leaves her husband and children because she feels her life is a sham.\n\nWhen A Doll's House was first staged in Copenhagen in 1879, it was hugely controversial because it showed a woman abandoning her family. In one German production, the actress playing Nora notoriously demanded that the ending be changed so that Nora stays with her family.\n\nToday, however, the play is recognised as a pioneering feminist play, with Unesco's Memory of the World register describing Nora as \"a symbol throughout the world, for women fighting for liberation and equality\". In 2006, A Doll's House was recorded as being the most staged play around the globe.\n\nNow, A Doll's House is getting a contemporary reboot by local theatre company Our Company. The play has been retitled Dear Nora and the setting changed to Singapore. The story has been adapted to show the grave and gradual dissolution of a marriage between two seemingly well-balanced, well-educated, well-off individuals, Nora and Thomas.\n\nPlaywright Michelle Tan, who adapted the classic into the Singaporean context, says: \"Like Ibsen, we see Dear Nora less as a feminist play than a humanist one. We're choosing to focus on the fragility of marriage and relationships and how they can start to unravel when, on the surface, everything seems perfectly fine.\"\n\nEthel Yap is the young actress who plays the mythical role of Nora. Speaking from her personal observations, she says: \"Not a few well-educated Singaporean women still play to the image of the contented wife, the good hostess, the attractive partner, the one who makes her husband feel good about being the man. She may be very intelligent, but she tries not to show that intelligence too much and risk turning off her man.\"\n\nDear Nora, then, attempts to show the journey of such a woman as she gradually comes to the conclusion that her life and identity are a lie, and her real needs and aspirations go beyond the bounds of her marriage. The only way she can realise the full extent of her potential is to abandon her husband and live on her own.\n\nFor director Luke Kwek, however, the story has much more resonance beyond the empowerment of Nora. Kwek, a corporate lawyer by day and theatre practitioner by night, says: \"In a sense, Dear Nora is also a story of the younger generation of Singaporeans and their relationship with the country. On the one hand, Singapore has sheltered us and given us almost everything we want.\n\n\"But there's a part of us that wonders if there could be so much more beyond what we have. And we wonder what sacrifices we would have to make in order to find those answers.\"\n\nDear Nora will be staged from June 18 to 22, 8pm, and June 19, 21 and 22 at 3pm at Drama Centre Black Box, The National Library.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/spore-potential-marketplace-gemstones", "site_title": "S'pore potential marketplace for gemstones", "publish_date": null, "content": "S'pore potential marketplace for gemstones\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Jun 18, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] The Republic has the potential to become the world's marketplace for gemstones, said London-listed gemstone miner Gemfields, which held its first-ever ruby auction in Singapore between June 12 and 17.\n\nThe firm, which sold 1.82 million carats of the 2.03 million carats offered at the auction, raked in sales of US$33.5 million, or an average of US$18.43 for each carat. Gemfields owns 75 per cent of a ruby mine in Mozambique and hopes to produce up to 30 per cent of the world's ruby supply in the next two to three years.\n\nSingapore is an ideal location for the inaugural auction as it is a neutral place for buyers from countries such as Thailand, the US, India, Germany and Israel to gather, said Gemfields' CEO, Ian Harebottle. \"It is safe, has great weather, and a tax-free environment.\"\n\nIn comparison, a city such as Dubai might not be as welcoming of buyers from certain countries such as Israel, he added. The buyers are typically gemstone cutters who would process and sell the stones to wholesale jewellery makers, who in turn sell to retail jewellery firms.\n\nMany of the auction participants, especially those from Thailand which has a large ruby market, were attending a Gemfields auction for the first time. Gemfields, which produces a fifth of the world's rough emeralds as well, also saw participants who had attended its emerald auctions previously, held in Singapore and cities such as Johannesburg and London.\n\n\"This cross-pollination of gem buyers across the range of gemstones produced by Gemfields is expected to further the company's vision for growth and development of the coloured gemstone sector internationally,\" the firm said.\n\nGemfields plans to hold three more ruby auctions in the next 12 months, likely in Singapore. The next one is expected to take place before the end of this year.\n\nIn preparing for the ruby auction, Gemfields developed a grading and sorting framework for rough rubies, a first for the market.\n\nBuyers were invited to inspect the stones at a row of booths set up at the Singapore Turf Club over the five days. They submitted bids - their own estimates of the value of the rubies - at the end, with the stones going to the highest bidder only if the price offered exceeds the firm's internal and undisclosed reserve prices for the lot. Of the 62 lots offered, 57 were sold.\n\nGemfields also vets beforehand the buyers it invites to the auction, ensuring that they have legitimate bank accounts and are registered with the relevant authorities, among other criteria.\n\nGemfields, whose share price on the London junior stock exchange AIM has more than doubled to \u00a351 in the past 12 months and now has a market capitalisation of \u00a3275.4 million (S$584.1 million), hopes to create higher demand for coloured gemstones through marketing and branding.\n\n\"Our vision is to do for coloured gems what De Beers did for diamonds,\" said Mr Harebottle, adding that the firm merely has to \"remind\" consumers of the value of gemstones.\n\nDe Beers is credited with increasing consumer demand for diamonds, transforming it into a symbol of love and creating the famous advertising slogan \"a diamond is forever\".\n\nGemstones have become more popular in recent years as consumers become more individualistic in their tastes and seek unique jewellery, Gemfields said.\n\nThe firm also markets itself as an ethical mining company, providing a certificate for every stone that passes from its hands - this guarantees that the gemstones are problem-free and can be traced back to the mine.\n\nBesides the usual 4Cs of cut, colour, clarity and carat, \"we have added a fifth C of confidence,\" Mr Harebottle told reporters, adding that in many instances in history, expensive paintings have become worthless for their owners when found to be stolen. \"Traceability is to ensure that the gemstone retains its value.\"\n\nThe firm, on its way to building a portfolio of various coloured gemstones, is now on the lookout for opportunities to buy sapphire mines. It also does not rule out buying mines in countries in the region such as Myanmar.\n\nMr Harebottle's dream is for gemstone jewellery to become like pieces of art, where a creation is worth more than the sum of its parts.\n\n\"When you can create art with jewellery, that is everlasting,\" he said. \"And to do that, you have to have the whole spectrum - all the colours of the rainbow.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its regional managing director, Michele Ferrario, told BizIT that buyers in Asia tend to spend a lot more time considering their purchases, and that conversion rates aren't as high as those of Western sites such as UK e-tailer\n\nAsos.com\n\n.\n\nTo that end, Zalora just launched a new \"virtual fitting room\" feature, which it hopes will increase the level of confidence for shoppers, and in turn the amount they spend on the site. The feature, created by Swedish technology company Virtusize, displays the exact measurements of an item, and allows users to overlay a silhouette of a piece over another, so they can get an idea of how the item will fit based on size and cut. Users can save items that they've bought in the past and compare other products against those.\n\nZalora's reason for implementing the Virtusize feature is markedly different from Western counterparts, agreed Virtusize's Asia-Pacific manager, Andreas Olausson.\n\nVirtusize counts Asos and Monsoon in the UK, and Danish chain Magasin du Nord as customers, and these players have come to Virtusize in order to keep return rates down, he said.\n\nAsos's typical return rate hovers in the range of 30 per cent and upwards, and many of Virtusize's other Western clients have implemented the virtual fitting feature in a bid to reduce the costs associated with processing returns. Asos.com is Virtusize's biggest customer in terms of traffic and purchases made through Virtusize's feature.\n\nIn Asia, Virtusize has Esprit and Jabong in its portfolio.\n\nMr Olausson said that the situation is quite different in Asia, where the relatively younger e-commerce scene needs encouragement, and demand is coming from e-tailers that are looking to raise conversion rates, he said.\n\nMr Ferrario said that Zalora's return rates are about 10 per cent over the eight markets it operates in across South-east Asia, and Australia and New Zealand. It has about 1.5 million customers in the region. The two-year-old company has over 1,500 employees regionally now, starting from a base of 10.\n\nRight now, Zalora has the measurements of popular brands such as Mango and River Island in its database, but it will take between several weeks and months before all 20,000 SKUs (Stock Keeping Units) per country will be covered fully, he said.\n\nIntegrating Virtusize into its system is \"pretty straightforward\", said Mr Ferrario. It's placed an additional station to its warehouse supply chain that measures and logs the data of each piece of clothing coming in.\n\nVirtusize touts its 2D silhouette overlay technology as being more accurate than the 3D virtual fitting rooms that allow shoppers to \"try on\" garments. Some 3D machines take scans of shoppers' bodies, and allow users to put on clothing virtually over avatars.\n\nThis technology has been trailed, with limited success, by start-ups such as triMirror and 3d-A-Porter, but UK start-up Metail has been more successful, raising \u00a35.4 million (S$11.4 million) to date since it launched in 2009.\n\nAnders Rindevall, Virtusize's head of sales, said that the human body is not the perfect reference for clothing, because fit changes between items. It makes more sense to compare a piece of clothing against another on the site that you've previously purchased that fits really well, he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We only received what I would call positive feedback.\"\n\nMaersk and its two allies said last June that they'd agreed to establish an operational pact with the aim of reducing costs on Asia-Europe, trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific routes. Container lines have been battling industry overcapacity after a boom in ship orders collided with the global financial crisis, triggering the worst slump in prices for the carriage of cargo since containerisation became global in the 1970s.\n\nShares of Maersk, the world's biggest container line, fell as much as 8.3 per cent, the steepest intraday decline since May 16, 2012. The fall pared 2014's gain to 12 per cent and giving a market value of 285 billion kroner (S$65 billion).\n\nThe company accepts China's verdict and with no alternative plan in hand, it will now \"give up on P3\", Mr Andersen said. CMA CGM, based in Marseille, France, and MSC, which has its headquarters in Geneva, are both closely held.\n\n\"The surprise here is that China has not approved this plan even after regulators in the US and European Union have given it the go-ahead,\" said Lawrence Li, China transportation analyst at UOB Kay-Hian Investment Consulting in Shanghai. \"And antitrust laws there are tougher.\"\n\nThe companies had planned to commit 255 vessels deployed on 29 trade loops to a joint centre that would have run a combined fleet independently. Maersk was slated to contribute 42 per cent of the total, including its Triple-E class, the largest-ever container ships with a capacity of 18,000 boxes.\n\nChina's rejection of P3 comes after the US Federal Maritime Commission approved the alliance in March and the European Commission closed an EU antitrust probe this month.\n\nTrade has been a mainstay of China's economic development since former leader Deng Xiaoping first opened up the nation more than three decades ago. It entered the World Trade Organization in 2001, helping secure annual growth in excess of 10 per cent on average in the following decade.\n\nWhile policymakers in the world's second-largest economy sought to reduce its reliance on commerce in the aftermath of the 2009 recession, exports remain a source of strength.\n\nShipments abroad advanced 7 per cent in May from a year earlier, with imports down 1.6 per cent, a government report showed. China recorded a US$35.9 billion surplus for the month.\n\nThe Commerce Ministry said yesterday that the P3 plan might have benefited Maersk, MSC and CMA CGM at the expense of other operators, and that in \"numerous discussions\", the applicants had failed to show that the positive elements would outweigh any adverse impact. The three companies - which had always pitched the arrangement as \"operational, not commercial\" - control a combined 46.7 per cent market share, it said.\n\nThe \"closely coordinated joint operations\" proposed in P3 would also have been substantially different from the \"loose cooperation\" of current alliances, the ministry said.\n\nThe two main existing accords are G6, which includes Germany's Hapag-Lloyd AG and five Asian carriers, and CKYHE, which features Cosco Container Lines Co, the Chinese No 1.\n\nMaersk CEO Andersen said the partners had worked hard to address the concerns of all regulators involved.\n\n\"We thought it was a good proposition and that it would allow us to get cost out and reduce fuel consumption,\" he said. \"There was no impact on the market side. We never saw this as consolidation and neither did the US and Europe.\"\n\nMaersk has a 14.9 per cent share of the global market, based on the number of containers available in its own fleet and as chartered capacity, according to Alphaliner, which provides a daily update. MSC has 13.4 per cent and CMA CGM 8.6 per cent.\n\nThe P3 pact had initially aimed to commence operations during the current quarter, before Maersk said on May 21 that the start date had slipped to autumn amid regulatory scrutiny.\n\nMaersk Line, the company's container unit, more than doubled its net income to US$454 million in the first quarter as lower costs and higher volumes countered the drop in rates.\n\nDrewry Maritime Research analyst Neil Dekker said P3 was so large that plans for fleet deployment and a London control centre will have been well advanced, though China's ruling won't hurt Maersk Group's earnings targets, according to Mr Andersen.\n\n\"P3 would have been nice to have but it's not a must- have,\" he said. \"Maersk is in a very strong position. We are very competitive and making very good profits.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Accidents happen but fret not, there's asherbws.com - an online alcohol delivery service that was started by 24-year-old Triston Ong last December. He got the idea for the business because his family owns an offline alcohol distribution business called Chuan Hoe Trading Co, which distributes beers, wines and spirits to retail and convenience stores around Singapore.\n\n\"I felt that the business has to keep up with the current trends, and right now that trend is online and e-commerce,\" says Mr Ong, who a final year business management undergraduate. \"I wanted to get involved in the family business, so I started working on the offline part last year to learn how things worked first. It's great because I get to build on the existing platform and connections that my dad and granddad have established over the years,\" he adds. Towards the end of last year, he decided to start the website under a new brand name Asher, which currently stocks a few hundred varieties of beers, wines and spirits from all over the world.\n\nWhat customers have to do is simply create an account, place an order, and then they get to choose a preferred delivery timeslot between 10am and 7pm. Delivery can be done within the same day, or even months later.\n\nCreating a membership account also gives customers 10 per cent off prices listed on the website, while the $7 delivery fee is waived for orders above $68. \"The alcohol market is very competitive, but our prices are just as competitive, and usually cheaper than say 7-Eleven or supermarkets, because we supply to such places so we are sensitive about how we price our products,\" says Mr Ong.\n\nBut even then, he still feels the need to include some value-added services as part of his business in order to draw more customers. One way he does this is by organising wine-tasting and pairing sessions where Mr Ong invites various alcohol brand ambassadors to come and teach his customers more about their alcohol for a fee.\n\nHe explains: \"Alcohol is not cheap, so when you buy something, you want to be able to appreciate it. We think that tastings, pairings and sharing sessions are a good way to do that because when people understand what they are drinking, they can appreciate it better.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Mischief and irony course through the show, with works ranging from paintings and sculptures to light installations and digital cartoons.\n\nOne of the first things to greet you is a dull grey standard-issue computer keyboard. But each of its keys has been replaced by small plastic tombstones, so the keyboard looks like a crowded graveyard.\n\nThe 2008 work is a simultaneous dig at the supposed dullness of corporate life, as well as the American corporations whose toxic financial practices destroyed many lives in the Global Financial Crisis of 2007/2008.\n\nThe work is wickedly titled Oh Why So Serious? - a nod to the Joker's famous line in The Dark Knight (2008).\n\nWitty as the work is, the nearby digital animation titled Happiness (Finally) After 35,000 Years Of Civilization (after Henry Darger and Charles Fourier) is even better. The 17-minute cartoon tells a funny but potent tale of suburban housewives who create a Utopia for themselves. They live together and cook for each other happily - only to have their jealous husbands call on the military to kill them all. Mixing Darger's escapist tales with Fourier's theories of Utopia, the work is a supreme satire as it pokes fun at utopian ideals, suburban fantasies, feminism and patriarchy.\n\nAlso featured in the exhibition is a work that's garnered Chan his widest acclaim yet - his 7 Light series. Here, against single shafts of light, one sees shadows of objects rise to the sky and people plummet to the ground, among other images. The work carries broad references, from the Biblical account of the Seven Days of Creation, to the 9/11 tragedy where trapped victims jumped off the burning towers.\n\nChan, 40, draws his art from a deep well of political, philosophical and literary concepts. But it is his bold and inventive fusion of ideas, as well as his industrial-strength sense of irony, that make him such an exciting figure in contemporary art.\n\n'Paul Chan: Selected Works' is showing at the Schaulager from now until Oct 19. Located at Ruchfeldstrasse 19, 4142 M\u00fcnchenstein, Basel, Switzerland, it can be reached on Tram 11. Closed on Mondays\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Priced at HK$3.76 each, the share sale raises funds to expand facilities at Qingdao port in eastern China, the world's seventh busiest by shipping volume.\n\nThe company and its bankers chose the fixed-price strategy as it \"made it more efficient, simpler\" and faster to execute, one of the sources said. The sources, who weren't authorised to speak publicly on the matter, said they expect fixed-price deals to remain the exception as markets gradually stabilise.\n\nWeak demand and unfavourable market conditions saw Chinese pork producer WH Group Ltd pull a Hong Kong IPO late in April that once targeted up to US$5.3 billion in proceeds, while Lotte Shopping Co Ltd postponed an up to US$1 billion Singapore real estate investment trust listing three weeks ago.\n\n\"It's still a tough market. The problem is, apart from anything else, investors haven't made a lot of money in recent IPOs, so not a huge incentive for people to be too aggressive,\" a separate source said. \"You have to be very careful and very focused.\"\n\nThe Qingdao deal closed after just 31/2 days of bookbuilding, according to the sources, rather than the typical two weeks for most IPOs, when management and underwriters travel around the world to gauge demand at different price levels for the stock.\n\nQingdao Port International is the primary operator of the port of Qingdao. It handles about 76 per cent of the port's total cargo, according to the company's IPO prospectus.\n\nThe company plans to use 90 per cent of the proceeds to invest in new storage facilities for commodities such as oil and iron ore, as well as the construction of two crude oil berths, two general berths and two liquid chemical berths.\n\nBOC International, Citic Securities International and UBS AG were joint sponsors of the IPO and will share the US$6 million in sponsor fees.\n\nCLSA and Deutsche Bank also acted as joint bookrunners with the sponsors, with the group of banks standing to earn a combined US$6.5 million, equivalent to a 1.72 per cent underwriting commission, according to the IPO prospectus. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}
