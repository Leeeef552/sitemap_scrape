He declined to give a new forecast. That compares with 10.7 million tons produced a year earlier, he said.\n\n\"A lot of cane got cut for fodder in the last one month,\" Mr Gaikwad said by phone. \"Farmers are more than willing to sell cane for cattle feed as it's more profitable for them.\"\n\nSugar cane prices, which are fixed by the government, generally stay above fodder prices, except in some unusual years when poor rains boost prices of cattle feed ingredients. India, which jostles with Brazil as the biggest producer, swings between being a sugar importer and exporter, depending on the size of local output.\n\nA setback in the western state could further hurt the country's total output. India is expected to see its sugar production dropping to a three-year low of 28.2 million tons from a record of 32.95 million tons this year, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association. A bigger drop in production may reduce the country's record surplus, potentially curtailing exports and supporting global prices.\n\nWeather Woes\n\nMaharashtra is facing a shortage in fodder after several months of dry weather. The arrival of the monsoon brought some relief, but several areas are still suffering from scant rains.\n\nThe Marathwada region's rainfall since June has been 29 per cent lower than normal, while Vidarbha saw rains that were 19 per cent below average, according to the India Meteorological Department. Total rainfall across the state has been 7 per cent more than normal since June 1.\n\nSugar cane crushing in Maharashtra is likely to be delayed by a few weeks as the mills may wait for the plants to mature further for the chance of a better sugar recovery, Mr Gaikwad said.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nEnergy & Commodities\n\nPartners Group transfers Techem stake to its infrastructure fund\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:41 PM\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nGold hits three-week high as Trump widens trade war\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:16 AM\n\nOil rises over 2% as investors weigh market outlook, tariffs, sanctions\n\nJul 12, 2025 06:12 AM\n\nGold rises after Trump announces fresh tariffs on Canada, tariff threats to others\n\nJul 11, 2025 09:35 AM\n\nAster said to be in talks to buy Exxon Singapore stations: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 04:49 PM\n\nOil\u00a0falls amid bearish Trump tariff outlook\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:21 AM", "images": []}

Singtel will likely have weaker financial metrics in the coming year, S&P Global Ratings said, even as it affirmed its \"A+\" long-term and \"A-1\" short-term issuer ratings on the firm. Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings had also lowered their outlook to negative in March, while S&P warned in the same month that the telco was skirting closer to a ratings downgrade trigger. Shares of Singtel closed down four cents at S$3.33 on Wednesday before the company released a statement on S&P's outlook.\n\nGreat Eastern Holdings: Its\n\nsecond-quarter net profit fell 29 per cent\n\nto S$169 million from S$237.6 million for the year-ago period on the back of non-operating losses, the insurer said on Thursday morning. Great Eastern attributed the loss\u00a0to \"higher valuation of long-term insurance contract liabilities\" due to \"a decline in the discount rate used to value these liabilities\". The counter fell 31 cents or 1.2 per cent to close at S$25.42 on Wednesday.\n\nSingapore Airlines (SIA): The national carrier's first-quarter\n\nnet profit slipped 21 per cent to S$111 million\n\namid higher share of losses from associated companies, net finance charges and expenditure. For the quarter to June, improvement in Vistara, SIA's joint-venture airline in India, was offset by higher estimated losses at Virgin Australia while the adoption of accounting rules on leases and additional financing for fleet renewal and growth pushed up finance charges. SIA shares closed down five cents to S$9.67 on Wednesday before the results were out.\n\nSingapore Exchange (SGX): Net profit for its fourth quarter\n\nrose 24.1 per cent from a year ago to S$103.9 million,\n\nthe bourse operator said on Wednesday evening after trading hours. Revenue in the three months ended June 30 rose 16.5 per cent to S$248 million, led by record derivatives revenue of S$130.1 million. Earnings per share for the quarter was 9.7 Singapore cents, up from 7.8 cents in the same period a year earlier. Shares of SGX ended down three cents to S$7.92 on Wednesday.\n\nRoxy-Pacific Holdings: The mainboard-listed property group's net profit for the second quarter to June 30\n\nfell 16.2 per cent to S$4.21 million\n\n, while revenue rose 38.9 per cent to S$51.4 million on contributions from projects in Singapore and Australia. Roxy-Pacific said on Wednesday evening that it will prioritise shifting private homes in the Singapore market. But selling apartments turned out to be costly work as well, even as earnings slid on a lack of fair-value gain. Shares of Roxy-Pacific closed up 0.5 cent at S$0.39 on Wednesday before the results were released.\n\nBRC Asia: The mainboard-listed steel dealer\n\nshould return to the black in its third quarter\n\n, helped by its purchase of industry peer Lee Metal, it said on Wednesday evening. Commercial and cost synergies from the Lee Metal acquisition, \"as well as an improving business environment\", helped to lift the latest quarterly performance, the board said. BRC had reported a wider loss of S$7.74 million for the same period in the previous year. Its shares shed two cents to S$1.35 on Wednesday before the guidance was issued.\n\nLian Beng Group, KSH Holdings, Heeton Holdings: The trio of property developers\n\nconsolidated their stake in a plot of land in Brisbane, Australia\n\n, according to bourse filings on Wednesday after the market closed. They bought out their Australian partner, paying A$5.5 million (S$5.23 million) for the remaining 67 per cent stake in 186 Wickham Street, Fortitude Valley. All three counters ended Wednesday in negative territory before the announcement was made: Lian Beng shares slipped two cents to S$0.50, KSH fell 1.5 cents to S$0.455, while Heeton lost 0.5 cent to S$0.44.\n\nNo Signboard Holdings: Catalist-listed seafood restaurant operator No Signboard will\n\nlikely extend its losses into its third quarter\n\nto June 30, it warned on Wednesday evening. The group - which had rung up losses of S$337,500 in the three months prior - \"is expected to report a net loss... resulting mainly from lower revenue coupled with higher operating costs\", the board said. The counter closed up 0.1 Singapore cent to 6.2 cents on Wednesday before the profit guidance was filed.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

She renewed the criticism that gave her a viral moment in the first debate by accusing Mr Biden of making light of his work with the segregationists he served with in the Senate in the 1970s.\n\n\"The vice-president has still failed to acknowledge that it was wrong to take the position that he took at that time,\" the lawmaker said.\n\nThe crisp attacks came after the deep fault lines in the party between centrists and the progressive wing were exposed during the first night of debates between 10 other candidates.\n\nRARE UNITY\n\nIn one of the few moments of broad unity onstage, several candidates joined Mr Biden in condemning Mr Trump.\n\nSenator Cory Booker called him a \"demagogue,\" Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard said the president \"is not behaving like a patriot,\" and Julian Castro, the only Latino in the field, branded Mr Trump an outright \"racist.\"\n\nBut much of the night was consumed with clashes between the candidates, and Mr Biden - under pressure to come out re-energised and surefooted - was poised to counterpunch against Ms Harris after she got under his skin in the first debate.\n\nBut even as his advisors urged him to be more aggressive, the 76-year-old Biden took a curious first step: disarming and dismissing perhaps his most formidable rival.\n\nMoments before the debate began, Mr Biden greeted Ms Harris, a 54-year-old former California attorney general, by shaking her hand and saying, \"Go easy on me, kid.\"\n\nThe intense debate the night before exposed deep fault lines between the party's progressive wing led by candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and centrists who warned that overzealous liberal policies would turn off millions of voters across the country.\n\nWednesday's progressive candidates highlighted the divisions, too.\n\n\"Middle ground approaches are not enough,\" said Washington Governor Jay Inslee, whose singular issue is climate change and has released a trillion-dollar plan to tackle it.\n\n\"We must confront the fossil fuel industry,\" he added.\n\n'NO REDEMPTION'\n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio, in the race's far left lane, laid down the gauntlet demanding bold change, saying he was fully prepared to \"restructure society.\"\n\n\"We will tax the hell out of the wealthy,\" he boomed.\n\nLow-polling candidates on the stage like Mr de Blasio, Mr Inslee, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and entrepreneur Andrew Yang are desperate for breakout moments to boost their exposure and justify staying in the race, but few were evident.\n\nThe stakes are high, with the 20 candidates likely to be winnowed by as much as half ahead of the next showdown in September.\n\nMr Booker, seeking his own breakout, entered into a searing exchange with Mr Biden over his criminal justice record.\n\n\"There are people right now in prison for life for drug offenses, because you stood up and used that tough-on-crime phony rhetoric that got a lot of people elected, but destroyed communities like mine,\" Mr Booker said.\n\nMr Biden countered by arguing that Newark's police department was troubled when Mr Booker was mayor there and advocated a stop-and-frisk policy targeting blacks.\n\n\"This isn't about the past. This is about the present,\" Mr Booker shot back. \"I'm happy you evolved, but you have offered no redemption to the people in prison right now.\"\n\nMr Castro also attacked Mr Biden for standing with Mr Obama amid ramped up deportations.\n\n\"It looks like one of us has learned the lesson of the past and one of us hasn't,\" Mr Castro, who served as Mr Obama's housing secretary, told Mr Biden.\n\nBut Mr Biden hit back at Mr Castro's controversial proposal to decriminalise illegal border crossings: \"I have guts enough to say his plan doesn't make sense.\"\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:54 PM\n\nSuspended Thailand PM Paetongtarn hit by ethics investigation, source and media say\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:07 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/ef196a6af30c5125f57b952634e25e14c0894075ae3feb1e8b0fac5f05b3cf03?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "US Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden went on the offensive on Wednesday against his main 2020 opponents but was rapidly assailed on the debate stage over key issues like health care, race, immigration and criminal justice."}]}

Study in mice offers clues", "publish_date": null, "content": "Can diet help cancer treatment? Study in mice offers clues\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Aug 1, 2019 \u00b7 03:40 AM\n\n[TOKYO] Diet is already a key part of managing diseases like diabetes and hypertension, but new research adds to a growing body of evidence that it could help cancer treatment too.\n\nThe study, published Thursday in the journal Nature, found restricting intake of an amino acid found in red meat and eggs significantly enhanced cancer treatment in mice, slowing tumour growth.\n\n\"These are very strong effects, and they are effects that are as strong as we would see with drugs that work,\" said lead researcher Jason Locasale, an associate professor at Duke University's School of Medicine.\n\n\"What this study is showing is that there are many situations where a drug by itself doesn't work, but if you combine the drug with the diet, it works, or the radiation therapy doesn't work well, but if you combine... with the diet, it works well,\" he told AFP.\n\nThe study focused on restricting intake of the amino acid methionine which is key to a process called one-carbon metabolism that helps cancer cells grow.\n\nMethionine restriction has already been associated with both anti-aging and weight loss, but its importance to cancerous cells suggested it could also be a promising way to enhance cancer treatment.\n\n- 'Starving the cancer' -\n\nThe researchers first tested methionine restriction in healthy mice to confirm it was having the desired effects on metabolism and then moved to testing it in mice with colorectal cancer and soft tissue sarcomas.\n\nThey found that a low dose of chemotherapy, which on its own had no effect on colorectal cancer, led to \"marked inhibition of tumour growth\" when combined with methionine restriction.\n\nSimilarly, combining methionine restriction with radiation therapy in the case of the soft tissue sarcoma reduced tumour growth.\n\n\"You're starving the cancer cells of certain nutrients, at a very basic level,\" explained Mr Locasale.\n\nHe cautioned that the results should not be extrapolated beyond the cancers tested so far, and that the research was far from being tested in humans.\n\n\"This is certainly not a be-all, end-all to cancer, this is not some panacea,\" he said.\n\n\"What it's showing is that there are very interesting interactions between the food we eat, how it changes metabolism... and then how those changes in cellular metabolism might have an effect on tumour growth.\"\n\nIndependent experts also warned against reading too much into the study just yet.\n\n\"Before drawing any conclusions about the potential for dietary restriction as an approach to treating cancer, human studies are needed,\" said Paul Pharoah, a professor of Cancer Epidemiology at the University of Cambridge.\n\n- 'Really exciting' -\n\nMr Locasale and his colleagues extended the research by testing a methionine restricted diet in six healthy humans, and found that the effect on human metabolism appeared similar to that seen in mice.\n\nThat suggests that the diet could have a similar effect on certain tumours in humans, though Locasale warned it was far too early to draw any definitive conclusions.\n\nAnd Tom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King's College London, warned that \"there is no evidence from this study to suggest following a vegan diet with help patients with cancer.\"\n\nMr Locasale said he hoped to eventually test the research in humans with cancer, but noted that nutrition research often struggles for funding because it proposes treatments that are not easily monetizable.\n\nStill, he said the work adds to a body of research that suggests diet may play an important role in cancer treatment.\n\nLast year, a study showed one type of chemotherapy drug was more effective in combination with a diet low in sugar and high in protein and fat. Other cancers appear to be better combatted in combination with low-sugar diets.\n\n\"It's just a really exciting area right now... where we're seeing that diet has a huge effect on human health,\" Mr Locasale said.\n\nHe hopes for a future where doctors will eventually be able to advise cancer patients to follow specific diets to assist their treatment.\n\n\"We're not there yet, but the goal is to eventually get there.\"\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nLifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}

While an agreement may be reached soon, talks are ongoing and could still fall apart, the people said. Other health-care companies and buyout firms have expressed interest in acquiring the assets, the people said.\n\nInvestment firm Columbia Pacific Management had been considering selling Columbia Asia for as much as US$2 billion, people familiar with the matter said in November, when Bloomberg News first reported on the sale.\n\nRepresentatives for Seattle-based Columbia Pacific and Hong Leong didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

Columbia Pacific also owns a separate health care business in China.\n\nPrivate hospital operators in Asia have emerged to meet the demands of middle-class and affluent consumers looking for better medical care. That's attracted interest from investors seeking to tap into the growth potential.\n\nAnother example of the trend is billionaire Anthoni Salim's plan to sell a stake in his Metro Pacific Investments Corp.'s hospital unit that could value the business at more than US$2 billion, people with knowledge of the matter have said.

The Korean won fell, while the benchmark bond yield rose.\n\nJapan's planned revision of a law to take South Korea off its so-called \"white list\" comes amid a deepening row over compensation for wartime forced labour and after Japan tightened curbs this month on exports to South Korea of high-tech materials used for making memory chips and display panels.\n\nSouth Korea's foreign minister Kang Kyung-wha warned that if Japan removes South Korea from its list of countries with minimum trade restrictions, Seoul would have to review bilateral security cooperation.\n\nRelations between Japan and South Korea are arguably at their lowest since they normalised ties in 1965, with a spiralling diplomatic and trade row threatening to disrupt the global supply of semiconductors and undercut security cooperation on North Korea.\n\nMs Kang asked her Japanese counterpart to keep the country on a \"white list\" of countries that enjoy minimum trade restrictions, Japan's Kyodo News reported. Investors hold lean hopes of a positive negotiation between South Korea and Japan, said Lee Won, an analyst at Bookook Securities. The Kospi index has been affected by remarks of diplomatic officials, he added.\n\nThe Seoul stock market's main Kospi index ended down 7.22 points or 0.36 per cent at 2,017.33 points.

Treasury yields and the US dollar rose in Asia on Thursday though a decline in stocks eased.\n\n\"The perceived hawkish rate cut will probably take a bit of steam out of a market rally in dollar Asian credit,\" said Todd Schubert, head of fixed-income research at Bank of Singapore. \"We were expecting more of a coupon clipping type of performance during the second half of 2019. Powell's comments don't change this base case.\"\n\nAsian central banks, including those in India, Indonesia and Korea, had already preceded the Fed in cutting rates, boosting the attractiveness of corporate debt for investors looking for spread. While bets on future Fed rate cuts eased after Mr Powell's comments, bond buyers are still counting on central bankers globally unleashing more stimulus to forestall a rapid slowing in the global economy, which should be supportive of credit.\n\nAsian dollar bonds have handed investors gains of about 8.9 per cent year to date, with high-yield notes out-performing investment-grade offerings.\n\n\"This is going to be a short-term setback for the market,\" said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income. \"People are going to continue pushing the edge of their comfort zone in order to get some yield in the portfolio because in the end these central bankers do not want an economic slowdown.\"\n\nHere's how the Asian dollar bond market reacted to the Fed's dovish turn in 2019:\n\n\u2022 Issuance\n\nAfter a solid start to the year, Asian dollar bond issuance has taken off in the last few months, with record monthly sales in May, June and July, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Issuers still have a lot of incentive to sell, with memories fresh of the credit crunch in the market in the last quarter of 2018.\n\n\u2022 Junk Wave\n\nLed by Chinese developers, Asian speculative-grade issuers have really racked up sales this year, with year-to-date dollar bond issuance already topping past full-year highs.\n\n\"For fixed income, given that global central banks are mostly pointing towards rate cuts, high-yield corporate debt and emerging market debt should be well supported by yield-seeking institutional investors, even though their valuations are rich,\" said Tai Hui, Chief Market Strategist, Asia Pacific, JPMorgan Asset Management.\n\n\u2022 Tight Spreads\n\nSpreads on investment-grade Asian dollar bonds crunched to the lowest in 15 months in July.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:54 PM\n\nSuspended Thailand PM Paetongtarn hit by ethics investigation, source and media say\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:07 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/ed10a7fff4b1d204653c98a924a5e49af0644941034556e5478312077815d09a?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's surprise hawkish tone on Wednesday will likely slow this year's rally in Asian dollar bonds, but market participants see the wave of disappointment as just a speed bump."}]}

I want universal suffrage.\"\n\nDuring an unprecedented siege of the legislature on July 1 -- as Hong Kong marked the 22nd anniversary of its handover -- a colonial flag was briefly draped in the debating chamber.\n\n- Wrong message -\n\nBut the colonial flag did not stay up for long -- an indication of the mixed feelings it provokes among protesters, the majority of whom are not advocating for independence and fear that overseas flags play into Beijing's narrative.\n\nBy far the most popular flag of choice at the rallies has been a wilting version of a Bauhinia flower -- Hong Kong's official emblem -- on a black background, a nod to the idea that the city's unique freedoms and character are rotting away.\n\nSome Hong Kongers say people's discontent with China should not provoke admiration for Britain, a colonial master that never granted democracy to the city's inhabitants either.\n\nA popular forum used to discuss news around the protests asked users to vote on whether they thought protesters should display colonial-era flags during marches, with 3,500 responding no and a mere 250 saying yes.\n\n\"Foreigners might misunderstand when seeing it,\" one person wrote. \"Hong Kongers want to rule Hong Kong, instead of being ruled by the Chinese mainland or the United Kingdom.\"\n\nThere have also been confrontations among protesters over colonial flags at rallies.\n\nDuring a blockade of the city's police station this month, AFP witnessed protesters confronting another elderly man who is a regular at the protests waving a colonial flag.

It will account for about half its global production capacity of 4.5 million tonnes annually by 2022.\n\nThe company is currently the only one offering renewable diesel on a global basis, according to Neste chief executive officer and president Peter Vanacker. The expansion will increase renewable fuel output from 1 million tonnes per year to 2.3 million, while the plants in the Netherlands and Finland account for the rest of its production capacity. With the new facility, Singapore will also become Neste's first site to produce renewable jet fuel at a commercial scale as the company expands its product slate beyond renewable diesel.\n\nThis was announced by Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for Social Policies Tharman Shanmugaratnam in his speech at Neste's foundation stone ceremony on Wednesday to mark the extension of the new production line. In his speech, Mr Tharman said that the upcoming expansion will create over 100 local jobs, and commended the firm for its commitment and emphasis on training.\n\n\"Neste has developed specialised in-house training for their workers to equip them with the necessary skills in its niche technology. These include e-learning and simulated on-site training, as well as sending workers to Neste's sites in Finland and Netherlands,\" he said. The company is also working towards using lower-quality waste and residues in its process of creating renewable products.\n\n\"We are exploring extensively with other companies and other industries to identify these streams, make them commercially viable, and utilise them to replace fossils,\" said Mr Vanacker.\n\nFor instance, innovative capabilities to process dirtier waste animal fat and residual plant oils will be developed in the Singapore facility.\n\nThe firm is also looking at ways to introduce liquefied waste plastic as a future raw material for fossil refining.\n\nMr Tharman said that this increases material efficiency, and reduces crude oil dependency and carbon footprint. The expansion plans also come amid a critical need for innovations to tackle climate change.\n\n\"Without innovations to create efficient, affordable and scalable forms of clean energy, the cost to economies and societies of transiting to clean energy will be far higher. It will then be far more difficult to secure the necessary political commitment in any democracy to make that transition,\" said Mr Tharman.\n\nWhile most of the demand for Neste's products come from Europe and North America, Mr Vanacker told The Business Times that Singapore is \"definitely at the forefront\" among countries in the Asia-Pacific, contributing to the choice of the Republic as a development site for Neste.\n\nAmong other reasons are high technology as well as good infrastructure and logistics systems.\n\nThe expansion follows an investment of S$2.1 billion by Neste. Construction of the expanded plant started earlier this year and is expected to be ready in the first half of 2022.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They include lower taxes for manufacturers and buyers of electric cars, and benefits for EV (electric vehicles) owners, such as special parking areas, the draft that's only awaiting the president's approval shows.\n\nThe country is vying with nearby Singapore and Thailand to become the dominant force in South-east Asia for electric cars, part of an effort to fortify the local economy and reduce reliance on imported oil. Indonesia, one of the largest untapped markets for electric vehicles, wants EVs to constitute a quarter of its car production by 2030 as it tries to bring in more global companies.\n\nPresident Joko Widodo is set to sign the new rules into force \"very soon\", Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said on Tuesday. Teten Masduki, head of the presidential special staff, declined to comment, while a presidential spokesman, Erlin Suastini, didn't return calls.\n\nThe rules would change taxation of vehicles so they would be levied based on fuel consumption and carbon emissions instead of body type and engine size, favouring electrified vehicles. Under current rules, a US$65,000 BMW X3 sDrive sport utility vehicle carries a lower luxury tax rate than a US$58,000 Hybrid-powered Toyota Camry because sedans have been considered a more luxurious car type.\n\nThe new rules will also require carmakers to gradually increase the amount of locally produced parts to 80 per cent by 2029, according to the draft.

Toyota, which has the biggest market share in Indonesia, has said it plans to spend US$2 billion to build hybrid vehicle plants in the country.\n\nHyundai Motor Co is set to build two plants, including an electric-vehicle unit, in Indonesia by investing US$1 billion, according to Indonesian Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs Luhut Pandjaitan.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/startups/trouble-narrowly-backed-startup-accelerators", "site_title": "The trouble with narrowly backed startup accelerators", "publish_date": null, "content": "The trouble with narrowly backed startup accelerators\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Jul 31, 2019 \u00b7 11:22 PM\n\nThe spotlight on South-east Asia's startup ecosystem has never shone brighter. Startups have mushroomed in every corner of a region that has attracted record levels of venture capital and private equity investment, and that is expected to produce at least ten unicorns within the next five years. The pace of such development owes mainly to the convergence of several market conditions such as young and tech-savvy populations, robust regulatory support and not least, the glut of startup accelerators which have sprung up to bolster the ecosystem.\n\nThere are 53 active accelerators headquartered in the region, all looking to identify and support ambitious founders in transforming their ideas into the next multimillion-dollar and globally significant company. Yet, for every new accelerator program that launches with fresh capital to stoke the boom, just as many seem to be closing their doors with alarming frequency. In Singapore, the recent exits of JFDI and Telstra's muru-D have raised questions about the viability and sustainability of such models in the region. Is there a replicable model to Y Combinator's legacy of success?\n\nThere are two main models of accelerators in the regional ecosystem:\n\nEach has its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSelf-supporting programs have historically experienced a cash-flow challenge. Can their portfolios quickly produce enough exits to reinvest into the program? Even then, the proceeds might be in stock, which cannot be used to cover the requisite overhead costs of running the program. The runway is often shorter for independent programs, which may revise their terms to be less founder-friendly, relocate to a smaller space farther from attractive areas or take other measures to narrow the gap. While these steps might preserve enough operating expense to sustain the program for a little longer, they also create a negative feedback loop whereby lower quality startups apply to and are admitted to the program, thus diminishing the odds for exits, and so on. At some point, it collapses in upon itself, and the doors close.\n\nHowever, self-supporting programs do not have to concern themselves with corporate alignment and can remain vertical agnostic. They are able to create more innovative cohort groups comprising diverse founders and startups. They also enjoy the advantage of not constantly having to worry about how well their corporate sponsor is faring. In a sense, they operate more like startups themselves, which offers advantages such as nimbleness, independence and program innovation. Consequently, startups generally enjoy a better experience in these programs.\n\nCorporate accelerator programs tend to have very different problems. Rather than a slow drain of cash, leading to death, these programs need to strike a balance between nurturing startups and ensuring that the sponsors are receiving sufficient value for their investment. As a result, participating startups may have to deal with exclusivity clauses, interference from corporate staff and events that prevent them from focusing on their business. The investment terms are often not as attractive to the best startup founders, creating a negative feedback loop similar to the one for independent programs. In many cases, there is also minimal real access for startups to the corporate sponsor.\n\nAt Accelerating Asia, we believe there is a need to break the typical accelerator model that often gives rise to competing interests through the reliance on a single source of funding. Operating independently allows us to better align our outcomes with the startups we work with and ensure our founders will always be our priority from day one. We also work with governments and organisations to design and manage effective startup engagement programs.\n\nThe crux of Accelerating Asia's model is an ecosystem built around the core accelerator. The core programme attracts quality startups, which in turn draws top investors and mentors. Connected into this core are the other programs that we design and run in partnership with organisations looking to build a valuable platform for startup engagement. These programs add their own high-quality startups, mentors and investors that can be shared across the ecosystem.\n\nBy designing and running startup engagement programs for our partners, we generate revenue that we can use to diversify the income streams and invest in resources that benefit the AA ecosystem as a whole as well as each individual program. Most programs in South-east Asia are \"putting all their eggs in one basket\", which is inherently risky should the sponsor change tack.\n\nThe high quality of Accelerating Asia's first cohort speaks to the success of the program. These 10 teams all have revenue and customers with aggregate monthly revenue exceeding S$100,000, had raised more than S$1 million in investment prior to joining and have raised more than S$1 million in the first six weeks of the programme.\n\nSouth-east Asia's thriving startup ecosystem is developing at an incredible pace and as startups and investment activity continue to grow exponentially, so too must accelerators evolve to meet these new challenges head-on. A little over a decade ago, accelerators were merely a foreign concept viewed by investors as an unproven, complicated model. Today, scaling a tech community to a critical mass without accelerators in place as enablers is almost unthinkable.\n\nIn a region as complex and disparate as South-east Asia, success is also often predicated on the compatibility between startups and accelerator programs. This requires a fundamental shift in the operating models of existing programs that often focus on identifying the best but not necessarily the right founders.

This is one of the biggest ever data breaches.\n\nThe hacker, 33-year-old Paige Thompson from Seattle, went by the moniker \"erratic\" online and used to work for Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is yet unclear if her actions were driven solely by criminal intent. But one major concern is, prima facie, the relative ease with which she managed to get into the highly secure database of a bank that is not just the 10th largest in the US but one with a long-held reputation for its digital prowess.\n\nPredictably, questions have again been raised about how safe consumer data is in the hands of service providers. Data, especially personal data, has become the new currency of today's rapidly digitalising global economy. For hackers, there is financial profit to be gained from selling such data, but there could be even more nefarious motives. The Capital One breach, which occurred in March, is but the latest that has come to light in a string of high-profile data break-ins across the world, including Singapore. Other big names that fell victim to cyber attacks include credit monitoring firm Equifax and Internet giant Yahoo.\n\nDespite the all-too-frequent regularity in which breaches occur, the good news is that for every breach that is reported, cyber defences thwart literally hundreds of hacking attempts. According to a Cisco study, in 2018 Asia-Pacific companies faced six cyber threats every minute.\n\nIn the Capital One incident, information available so far indicate that Thompson accessed a firewall that was not properly configured and used basic hacking tools such as an anonymous browser and a virtual private network (VPN). The bank got to know of the breach only through an anonymous e-mail tip-off after she had apparently boasted about her exploits on social media.\n\nTo be clear, current security systems used by large organisations like banks - not least one as tech-savvy as Capital One - are mostly highly robust and fairly state-of-the-art, thanks to the use of technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. So what went wrong? These systems are geared to thwart hacking attempts by criminal gangs, many of whom have the support of nation-states. These hackers use a number of sophisticated techniques, including what is known in cyber security lingo as APT or advanced persistent threat. In an APT, the hacking attempt could last for months using a combination of different methods, such as customised malware that could compromise employees' personal devices and, from there, gain access to a particular network.\n\nIt is possible that the Capital One hacker was successful because she used a less sophisticated method that exploited a known vulnerability with the help of insider knowledge. As companies increasingly put valuable data in the cloud on third-party servers, the network becomes more complicated. Thus, many more such vulnerabilities are likely to go undetected. A network's cyber defence is only as strong as its weakest link.\n\nAs Singapore increasingly uses the cloud to store the voluminous data generated every day, the Capital One hacking is yet another lesson that cyber breaches can happen from the most unexpected quarters. There is a need for a 360-degree view for cyber security.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Wildlife experts say better safety monitoring and stricter wildlife polices have helped the tiger population grow to its largest in about two decades.\n\n\"Once the people of India decide to do something, there is no force that can prevent them from getting the desired results,\" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at a news conference on Monday announcing the figures.\n\nBut as the number of tigers has increased, so have the human-tiger conflicts in India, a country of 1.3 billion.\n\nIndia has created nearly two dozen tiger reserves in the past decade, but many are surrounded by villages. As development projects shrink the space separating humans and tigers, the animals are spilling out of reserves in search of prey - wild pigs, cattle and sometimes people.\n\nFor more than two years, a female tiger that authorities had named T-1 stalked the hills of central India, where she was blamed for the deaths of at least 13 people. Last autumn, hundreds of officers and veterinarian sharpshooters riding elephants tried to tranquilise her. When that failed, T-1 was shot and killed.\n\nLast week, a group of villagers beat a tiger to death in the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve, about 200 miles (about 320 km) east of New Delhi, after it attacked several people. In a video of the incident that was shared widely, the tiger appeared to be trying to block the blows with its paws. Four people were arrested and charged under a wildlife protection law.\n\nPrerna Singh Bindra, a conservationist and author of The Vanishing: India's Wildlife Crisis, said the country needs \"a sound strategy\" to avoid human-animal conflicts. \"Forests are being fragmented,\" she said. \"We are saying yes to about 98 per cent of development and other projects in protected areas. If we keep cutting habitats, this tiger utopia is going to come crashing down.\" The tiger census released on Monday, which covered nearly 150,000 square miles (about 390 sq km) and tracked \"carnivore signs\" using thousands of camera traps, found that India's tiger population rose to 2,967 in 2018, about 700 more than in 2014. The world has only about 4,000 tigers left in the wild.\n\nThe report found that tiger populations had increased across India, with the highest number in Madhya Pradesh, a hot, shrubby state with more than 500 cats. Apart from the camera traps, thousands of wildlife officials covered more than 300,000 miles (about 480 km) on foot to collect dung samples and take photographs from thick green canopies.\n\nThe authors of the report, which was prepared by the central government's National Tiger Conservation Authority, called it \"the world's largest effort invested in any wildlife survey.\"\n\nValmik Thapar, a prominent Indian naturalist and a wild tiger specialist, said India had yet to realise its potential as a wildlife tourism destination, which would create jobs for some of the same villagers who are currently hostile toward the cats.\n\nAnd some parts of eastern India are still losing tigers, despite additional funds intended to save them. In several premier reserves, Mr Thapar said, there are \"no tigers at all\" . \"We need to focus on doing something about these problems,\" he said. \"We must look after these national treasures.\" NYTIMES\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nLifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}

Operating profit improved by 3.6 per cent to S$200 million\n\nRevenue came in 6.7 per cent higher for the quarter under review to S$4.1 billion from S$3.8 billion. Flown revenue was up 6.3 per cent with passenger flown revenue improving by nearly 9 per cent, buoyed by traffic growth and increase in capacity.\n\nDespite the significant capacity injection, RASK (revenue per available seat-kilometre) improved 1.3 per cent. Cargo flown revenue declined 8.4 per cent on lower cargo yield and cargo load factor due to weak cargo demand amid trade uncertainties.\n\nEarnings per share stood at 9.4 Singapore cents versus 11.8 Singapore cents previously. No dividend was recommended, same as the previous corresponding period.\n\nOperationally, both the parent airline company and the group's engineering arm SIA Engineering fared better over the first quarter while SilkAir and budget carrier Scoot put out weak showings.\n\nThe parent airline company's operating profit rose 28 per cent to S$232 million on the back of \"robust\" passenger flown revenue growth owing to a 9 per cent increase in passenger traffic. Passenger load factor rose 1.2 percentage points to 83.2 per cent, the highest on record for the first quarter, notwithstanding a 7.4 per cent capacity growth. RASK improved 2.4 per cent or 4.9 per cent on a constant currency basis.\n\nSIA Engineering's operating profit rose 80 per cent to S$18 million led by lower expenditure.\n\nSilkAir turned in an operating loss of S$16 million against a marginal profit of S$200,000 a year ago as it was significantly impacted by the grounding of its six 737 MAX 8 aircraft. The resulting capacity reduction coupled with a 2.9 per cent yield contraction led to lower revenue while expenditure rose 2.5 per cent primarily due to costs related to the MAX 8 grounding.\n\nScoot posted an operating loss of S$37 million from a S$1 million operating profit a year ago on higher expenditure. Other contributing factors included restrained capacity growth and lower yields.\n\nSIA said that passenger bookings in the forward months are tracking closely against capacity growth, supported by premium cabin traffic to key markets.

That contributed to a heavy drain on cash in the first half of the year.\n\nPlane parts are exempt from default World Trade Organization (WTO) tariffs under a 1980 pact signed by both the EU and Britain in its own right. But Airbus is worried extra red tape could slow supply chains and hamper the movement of engineers.\n\nMr Faury also sounded a broader alarm about rising global tensions and in particular recent US threats to impose sanctions on European planes and other goods following WTO rulings against European government subsidies to Airbus.\n\nThe French CEO called for a settlement in the long-running dispute, while Airbus included a warning in its results for the first time of damage to deliveries and finances if the punitive tariffs go ahead. The EU is gearing up to impose counter-tariffs after the WTO ruled separately against US subsidies to Boeing.\n\n\"It's important that there is a resolution at a given point, a settlement before tariffs are applied,\" Mr Faury said.\n\n\"We see the trade wars around the world growing and we don't believe this is something ... industry can benefit from and citizens can benefit from,\" he said.\n\nEurope's largest aerospace group said second-quarter adjusted operating profit rose 72 per cent to 1.98 billion euros (S$3 billion), led by strong demand for jetliners. Revenues rose 23 per cent to 18.32 billion euros.\n\nAnalysts were on average forecasting adjusted quarterly operating income of 1.77 billion euros on revenues of 17.82 billion, according to a company-compiled consensus.\n\nShares in Airbus opened up 1.2 per cent against a flat market.\n\nAirbus is trying to overcome industrial delays at a newly expanded plant in Hamburg, Germany, which has been struggling with enhanced cabins for the in-demand A321neo single-aisle.\n\nAirbus kept annual delivery and financial targets, but said it was studying how to increase the share of the A321neo within the wider A320neo family, with more details expected in months.\n\nAirbus is nonetheless on course to be the world's largest planemaker in 2019 as US rival Boeing faces a longer-than-expected grounding of its 737 MAX, ordered by worldwide regulators in March in the wake of two fatal accidents.\n\nBoeing last week posted its largest-ever quarterly loss due to the crisis.\n\nAirbus took 75 million euros in new charges in the second quarter related to the cost of winding down its A380 superjumbo programme after deciding to scrap output due to weak demand.\n\nAir France-KLM on Tuesday announced plans to retire the world's largest jetliner to concentrate on smaller models like the A350, which Airbus said was on track to break even this year after progress in curbing costs.\n\nAirbus took 90 million euros in other charges including compliance costs as it pursues an investigation into the use of middlemen in aircraft and other sales.\n\nPeople familiar with the matter have said Airbus hopes to submit the results of its own internal probe to UK and French investigators around the end of the year - a step towards what it hopes will result in a fine rather than criminal charges.\n\nMr Faury declined to comment on the probe.\n\n\"It's going in the right direction, it's progressing, but I'm unable to tell you when it will come to an end,\" he said.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/higher-audit-costs-are-price-worth-paying-big-4", "site_title": "Higher audit costs are a price worth paying for the Big 4", "publish_date": null, "content": "Higher audit costs are a price worth paying for the Big 4\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Jul 31, 2019 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nWHENEVER big companies crash and burn - Enron in 2001, banks in 2008, Carillion last year - investors invariably demand, where were the auditors, and why didn't they warn us?\n\nThe Big Four auditors - PwC, KPMG, Deloitte and EY - equally invariably respond that investors and politicians have unrealistic expectations about what auditors do, given how much money and time they are given to do their work.\n\nThat did not stop the US from tightening the rules in the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley corporate accountability act, including mandatory audits of internal controls. Companies and auditors complained bitterly about the costs of compliance.\n\nEuropean bank failures in the financial crisis sparked a further spate of new rules, and now the Carillion collapse has prompted the UK to consider going further still and forcing firms to split auditing from consulting. Concerns about rising costs are already starting to roll in.\n\nEY recently sent letters to all of its FTSE 350 clients warning that it would be boosting its audit fees due to \"unprecedented market forces\", while KPMG is scaling back its exposure to the building society sector partly out of concerns that smaller lenders cannot afford to pay for the additional work that now needs to be done.\n\nAuditors say there are three main drivers of higher fees. First, the EU decided to require companies to tender their audits once a decade and change auditors at least every 20 years. Tendering and getting to know a new client adds costs, and shorter contracts mean investments in new people and technology can't be spread over many years.\n\nSecond, UK regulators and international accounting standards setters are demanding that auditors up their game by providing more sophisticated modelling of risks, as well as more documentation of what they have done to challenge management assumptions.\n\nThird, if firms do have to split auditing and consulting, they must ensure audit businesses are profitable on their own, rather than being loss-leaders for the larger firm.\n\nMost of the Big Four firms, and Grant Thornton, which is No 5, have announced or carried out big hiring pushes as they seek to bulk up on experienced auditors and modelling experts, as well as invest in artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\nAt EY, that has led to the letters warning of higher fees. Head of audit Hywel Ball explains that the increases \"reflect the significant investments we have already made in new technology, regulatory compliance and talent, plus recognising the tendering and switching costs. This is about delivering sustainable, high-quality audits\".\n\nBETTER OVERSIGHT\n\nKPMG isn't sending out formal letters, but it is also warning clients about the cost impact of tougher standards and rethinking its fees. The firm, which used to audit half of all UK building societies, has dropped about a dozen clients in the sector. Part of this is due to mandatory rotation, but there is also a financial motive. \"We are making sure that we are getting paid appropriately when more work is done,\" says Michelle Hinchcliffe, who heads audit at KPMG.\n\nAs the UK government gears up for a further crackdown, it is worth asking whether companies and investors are getting their money's worth from what has already been done.\n\nIn the US, once teething problems were sorted out, Sarbanes-Oxley became just another part of the regulatory landscape. And a 2017 study found that companies identified by auditors as having weak internal controls were 80 per cent more likely to have a future fraud revelation.\n\nIn the UK, the auditor-rotation rules are having an impact. PwC calculates that 287 of FTSE 350 companies have tendered their audits since 2012, and 73 per cent of those have changed providers. It is too soon to tell whether fresh eyes will lead to better audits in Europe, but American studies have found that companies with new auditors have significantly higher restatement rates than those which stayed with the same firm.\n\nThe UK needs auditors with backbone, who are willing to stand up to even the most difficult managers. Grant Thornton has made a start by telling regulators that it plans to quit as Sports Direct's auditor after the retailer revealed a 674m-euro (S$1.03 billion) tax bill just hours before the accounts were due to be signed off. If that costs a bit more, it would be well worth it.

Her operational and strategic competences in the areas of culture and heritage will be valuable to enable the Foundation to pursue its development and address its future challenges.\"\n\nAnnouncing the appointment, the IOC noted that \"Ms Teo has acquired extensive experience in museum management, especially at the National Museum of Singapore, where she has been director for the last six years.\n\n\" She has also worked on the renovation of several galleries and initiated many innovative digital experiences. In addition, she has been responsible for organising three large festivals: the Singapore Heritage Festival, the Singapore Night Festival and Children's Season.\"\n\nThe International Olympic Committee is a not-for-profit independent international organisation made up of volunteers, which is committed to building a better world through sport. It redistributes more than 90 per cent of its income to the wider sporting movement, which means that every day, the equivalent of US$3.4 million goes to helping athletes and sports organisations at all levels around the world.\n\nThe Olympic Museum was inaugurated in 1993 and is the embodiment of the universal values of sports, culture, sharing and education.\n\nChang Hwee Nee, CEO of NHB, says: \"Angelita has been an energetic leader with a strong focus on innovation and experimentation. She has shown us that by putting history and technology together, we can enhance knowledge and increase enjoyment and access for audiences.\n\n\"I thank her for her strong contributions and congratulate her on her new role with the Olympic Foundation for Culture and Heritage in Lausanne. This speaks highly of Singapore's cultural professionals. I look forward to her flying the Singapore flag high and further strengthening international collaboration with Singapore.\"\n\nIn an interview with The Business Times, Ms Teo says the opportunity to work overseas and gain international exposure is beyond amazing.\n\n\"The Olympic Museum is a world class museum that shares inspiring stories about the history of the Olympics, and more importantly the strength of the human spirit over body and mind. I think there will be so many opportunities for collaborations and to spread this message internationally\".\n\nShe believes that her 17 years of experience in the culture and heritage industry was a definite advantage as her new role includes the management of the Olympic Foundation for Culture and Heritage.\n\n\"There are many qualified museum professionals for this job, but I think I had an added advantage because of my eight years of experience managing both the Singapore Heritage Festival and the Singapore Night Festival. I dare say there are not many museum directors who are festival directors as well.\"\n\nShe is going to be busy when she joins on Oct 1. There is the Youth Olympic Winter Games in Lausanne in January 2020 and the Olympic Games in Tokyo in July 2020. \"But I think the most important and immediate priority goes to knowing my new colleagues and creating opportunities to better understand the role that the museum and the Foundation play in contributing to the goals and aspirations of the International Olympic Committee.\"\n\nShe says the Olympic Museum is housed in a beautiful building. \"The sense of arrival when you see the museum can be emotional. The other thing that struck me was how engaged visitors were with the exhibits. I saw many parents explaining and sharing stories with their children while going through the exhibition, and that's a very good way to judge if a museum is doing its job well.\"\n\nOn the significance of her appointment for Singapore: \"I think it is such an honour to be the first Asian taking on a Director role at the IOC. Since the announcement, both Sport Singapore and the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) have reached out to me... The SNOC has been doing a great job in promoting the value of sports and the Olympic Games in Singapore for years, and I will definitely continue to work with them.\"\n\nShe says her role in Lausanne will involve the implementation of the IOC's cultural action plans, facilitate synergies between various cultural platforms and departments within the IOC, including the academies and Olympic museums internationally, and coming up with new ideas to develop cultural activities to promote Olympism in society.\n\nOn her interest in museums and heritage: \"I have loved watching documentaries since I was a child, and studying anthropology and archaeology in school made it very natural for me to join this industry.\n\n\" I must say I have been very fortunate because I found my calling where doors have opened and opportunities presented themselves for me to contribute to the sector.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/pianist-composer-tunes-her-swiss-singapore-roots", "site_title": "Pianist-composer tunes in to her Swiss-Singapore roots", "publish_date": null, "content": "Pianist-composer tunes in to her Swiss-Singapore roots\n\nShe's signed to Sony Classical; is a Young Steinway Artist; and grew up in Switzerland speaking Mandarin and Hokkien at home.\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Jul 31, 2019 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nMEET talented young pianist Rahel Johanna Kai Zhiah Senn who is making waves in the music world. The daughter of a Swiss father and a Singaporean mother, she grew up in Switzerland's largest city - Zurich - in a multicultural and multilingual environment.\n\nRahel Senn, as she is popularly known, was trained in classical piano by Russian piano maestro Konstantin Lifschitz at the University of Lucerne. She graduated with a Master of Arts degree in 2011 and has been performing in Asia, Europe and South America since then. Her repertoire is wide and ranges from classical to pop.\n\n\"Since graduating, I've been touring the world and releasing my own piano CDs. In 2018, I've been exclusively signed to Sony Classical which means a big change for me: an international label, a new management and new people to support my career,\" she tells The Business Times in an interview from her home in Zurich.\n\n\"I try to practise as much as possible, but lots of my time is invested in composing and producing new songs, too.\n\n\"Being a Young Steinway Artist means carrying responsibility too. I have a super international team from Steinway supporting my career through providing me the best instruments to play on and having me perform around the world.\"\n\nShe says her family isn't into the arts at all. In fact both her parents wanted her to become a doctor. When she started to study law at the University of Lucerne, she also received the opportunity to study under Lifschitz.\n\n\"I had to decide: either music or law. During the years of my studies my concert career started to grow, and quite soon I could make a living by playing the piano.\n\n\"It was my mum who introduced me to the piano - she is a big fan of Richard Clayderman. My parents always supported me in my musical education, and later I met people who supported me and pushed me forward.\n\n\"This positive energy keeps me going. My way is rather formed by destiny than through decisions. I believe in good forces and in predestination. Being named Young Steinway Artist in 2012 is an example. Being signed by Sony Music is another.\"\n\nShe says she grew up in Switzerland and \"spoke Mandarin and Hokkien at home and visited Singapore for five weeks every year. Thus, we had a very close relationship to our Singapore family\".\n\n\"As a composer, you're being inspired by: your childhood, your adolescence, your environment and experiences. I grew up with a heart half Swiss, half Singaporean, finding home nowhere but in music.\n\n\"When I was young, I had some bad experiences, too, due to my two-race background. In Switzerland, people shouted \"Ching-Chang-Chung\" at me, and in Singapore people spoke to me in English.\n\n\"Nowadays, I am thankful for who I am. Times have changed in the past 20 years, I have the impression that people everywhere have become more open minded and that borders begin to vanish. But sure, the feeling of not finding home here or there has influenced my style of composing.\"\n\nOn her music: \"Music comes from the heart, for this reason I am not keen to categorise it. My work is called neoclassical... I currently find myself in the comfortable situation that my music is being loved and distributed by Sony. A strong partner lets your confidence grow and you stop thinking of categories. It allows me to work genuinely and be myself. I'm enjoying this moment and hope to continue as long as possible.\"\n\nHer earlier CDs - Retour \u00e0 l'Art Brut, Temps, Opus Z and Patagonia contain her first piano works. But as she got more and more into producing (generating electronic sounds via computer and electronic instruments), she stepped away from the classical form of composing.\n\n\"In this sense, I see my works as a panorama of my growth. My new CD Lightness is the first one that I will release under a major label, Sony Classical, in September 2019. Through Sony, I can reach many more people than I did before.\n\nShe says the CD is so named \"because now is the right time to spread our wings and fly, and dream. I hope that through my music I can share some of the feeling of lightness with all those who feel or are captured in dark space, anxiety, stress, hate or fear.\"\n\nShebelieves in working hard to achieve her dreams. \"My philosophy is that every human being should continue learning no matter how old you are. Never stand still in life. Everything is possible if you work hard. As a pianist, I keep practising since there is so much to learn from the classical literature and through the ancient composers.\n\n\"As an artist, I wish to meet and work with as many people as possible. Fellowship is one of the most important things in today's life, I guess.\"\n\nWhile she lives in Zurich, she says she spends at least a month in Singapore every year as she feels a strong connection. Her mother has spent half her life in Switzerland. Her father worked as a physics professor in Zurich.\n\nMs Senn and her younger brother lived in Singapore for a year in 2011. \"That was a special experience for us as we came to know where we come from, spent time with our Singapore family and actually saw our bonds become firmer.\n\n\"This gave us the possibility to meet our relatives in our daily life. Before, we used to spend our summer holidays in Singapore.\n\n\"My brother and I speak Mandarin and Hokkien fluently. We love the Singapore lifestyle, and sometimes we feel sad about things changing and the loss of heritage in Singapore. There are so many hawker centres and wet markets which we knew since our childhood closing nowadays.\n\n\"I perform here regularly, most often in collaboration with the Embassy of Switzerland in Singapore. I'm planning my next concert at Shaw Symphony Stage at the Botanic Gardens in 2021.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Hang Seng Index has lost nearly 10 per cent since May, and the time lag between its moves and property prices is typically up to three months.\n\nAfter a brief correction late last year triggered by rising Sino-US trade tensions, Hong Kong home prices had rebounded nearly 10 per cent in the first half of 2019.\n\nOver the past decade, ultra low interest rates, limited housing supply and large capital flows from mainland Chinese buyers have pushed housing prices up more than 200 per cent.\n\nIn June, a flat of 60 square metres (646 square ft) on Hong Kong Island cost an average of HK$11.1 million (S$1.95 million), according to official data.\n\nSome property agents said the protests will have only a short-term impact on the housing market, which will be supported by pent-up demand, a shortage of land and expectations of lower interest rates.\n\nColliers International forecast housing prices will fall 4 per cent in the second half, while Midland expected housing prices to rise another 3 per cent to 5 per cent.\n\nOn the supply side, property developers could be more sensitive to market sentiment. \"They might slow down construction work on their new projects if market sentiment and the outlook are not optimistic,\" property consultancy JLL said.

A weighted 22 per cent of manufacturers expect a softer business outlook, while only a weighted 11 per cent anticipates business conditions to improve.\n\nOverall, this equates to a net weighted balance of 11 per cent of manufacturers predicting a declining business situation. This was a sharp dive from a year ago, which saw a net weighted balance of 7 per cent of firms which expected an improvement for the same period in 2018. It also worsened from the previous quarter, where a net weighted balance of one per cent anticipated a better business outlook between April and September 2019.\n\nOCBC economist Selena Ling said that the results \"clearly reflect the erosion of business confidence amid the persistent global trade tensions which has dragged on for a year\".\n\nManufacturing - which makes up about one-fifth of Singapore's economy - has been roiled by uncertainties from the trade conflict, slowing demand in China, and the peaking of the electronics cycle in the past year.\n\nIt has been the main drag to Singapore's economy in 2019 and reflected in a slew of dismal data, including double digit declines in exports, contracting Purchasing Managers Index figures (a barometer of manufacturing activity), and falling industrial production numbers.\n\nBut according to the EDB survey, not all is doom and gloom in the manufacturing sector. The biomedical manufacturing cluster is the most optimistic, supported by the pharmaceuticals segment which anticipates higher export demand for biological products.\n\nIn contrast, the chemicals, electronics and precision engineering clusters are the most downbeat. The chemicals cluster is concerned about declining refining margins and weaker demand, particularly China. In electronics and precision engineering, the weaker outlook is mainly due to the subdued demand for semiconductors and semiconductor-related equipment, as well as uncertainties from the US-China trade conflict that has broadened to the global technology sector.\n\nOn the employment front, a net weighted balance of 1 per cent of manufacturers plan to hire fewer workers in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the preceding quarter. Among the clusters, firms in the general manufacturing industries and precision engineering project a smaller workforce in the next three months.\n\nOn the outlook for the sector, Ms Ling said: \"Looking ahead, we expect 3Q19 to remain challenging for the manufacturing sector, barring a quick resolution in the US-China trade and tech war.\"\n\nWith manufacturing particularly hard hit, it was hoped that the services sector - which makes up about two-thirds of the economy - could cushion the impact and help prop up the economy.\n\nHowever, in a separate survey by Singstat, it was found that the business expectations of services firms have also moderated for the second half of 2019, even though it remained in positive territory.\n\nSome 12 per cent of firms foresee slower business, while 14 per cent of firms are optimistic about business conditions. This results in a net weighted balance of 2 per cent of firms predicting a more favourable business outlook - weaker than the 9 per cent recorded for the same period last year. It also eased from the 4 per cent seen in the previous quarter.\n\nThis comes as the services sector is also vulnerable in Singapore's open economy, although export-oriented factories fare the worst in a global trade war.\n\nWithin the services sector, the accommodation and food & beverages (F&B) services are the most upbeat, mainly due to the year-end festive season and the upcoming Formula One night race in September 2019. Meanwhile, the retail trade, wholesale trade and financial & insurance industries are the most pessimistic, partly due to the trade conflict.\n\nIn terms of employment, the services sector still expects an increase in hiring activity in the third quarter, with a net weighted balance of 5 per cent. Firms in the retail trade expect to cut back on hiring, while those in F&B services and real estate are the most positive about adding to their headcount.\n\nThe survey results - conducted over June and July 2019 with a total of about 1,897 firms - came out hours before the US Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade on Wednesday, amid a global economic slowdown.\n\nWith Singapore at risk of a technical recession, or two straight quarters of quarter-on-quarter contractions, expectations are high among economists that the official full-year growth forecast for 2019 (which currently stands at 1.5-2.5 per cent) will soon be cut. Market watchers are also projecting that monetary policy could also be eased in October, if the outlook continues to deteriorate.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Mr Abe has put greater importance on growth to safeguard the fragile economy than fiscal reform.\n\nSolid domestic demand has helped offset weaker exports so far this year, but a planned sales tax hike in October to 10 per cent from 8 per cent could curb consumer spending.\n\nMr Abe voiced his readiness to boost fiscal spending if the tax increase hurts consumption. \"As we aim to achieve our fiscal reform target, we'll do the utmost to steer economic and fiscal policy appropriately and flexibly,\" Mr Abe told government's top economic council. \"We will respond as appropriate while watching to see any swings in demand after the tax hike, and the most up-to-date economic situation.\"\n\nWeak external demand forced the government to lower economic growth forecasts from the January estimate. It now expects real and nominal GDP growth at 2 per cent and above 3 per cent , respectively, from fiscal 2023, which many private-sector economists see as rosy.\n\nThe government on Monday cut its fiscal 2019 real GDP growth forecast to 0.9 per cent from 1.3 per cent .\n\nIn Wednesday's report, inflation was not forecast to reach 2 per cent until 2024, a further setback for the government's and the central bank's aim of meeting the inflation target.\n\nBased on government's more conservative 'baseline scenario', in which real GDP growth is estimated to hover around 1 per cent in the coming years, the primary budget was seen in the red through the forecast period to fiscal 2028.

Instead, they're deepening America's affordability crisis.\n\nWhat began on the coasts, in areas like New York and San Francisco, is now radiating into the nation's heartland, as well as to cities from Las Vegas to Charleston, South Carolina. Entry-level buyers are scrambling to purchase homes that are in short supply, sending values soaring.\n\nExpectations that the Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates this week will do little to change the sober reality: For many, prices have risen much faster than incomes, pushing homeownership out of reach for a new generation of hopeful buyers. That's cooling the market, with the 2019 spring season shaping up as the slowest for sales in five years, according to CoreLogic Inc.\n\n\"All signs point to a housing market that should be doing really well and it's not,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com. \"The No 1 constraint, despite low mortgage rates, is that people can't find housing that they feel is affordable.\"\n\nDean Rusch, a 29-year-old chemical-plant worker, has been trying to buy a starter home for less than US$200,000 in Louisville, Kentucky, since April. On three occasions, houses he planned to tour were snapped up before he could get there. He was outbid on another. He finally had an above-asking offer accepted on a house listed for about US$199,000, but only after his agent locked the door during a showing, keeping another buyer out. For much of his hunt, it was slim pickings.\n\n\"I've looked at some crappy ones,\" Mr Rusch said. \"I used to be in the fire department, and smelled some crazy stuff. But one smelled so horrible that it gave me a headache.\"\n\nRecent months have shown a growing divergence between the high and low ends of the US market. Prices in the bottom third jumped about 9 per cent in June from a year earlier, compared with 1.1 per cent growth for the top third, data from Redfin shows. Meanwhile, sales for lower-priced homes plunged almost 20 per cent as buyers struggled to find properties in their range, according to Zillow.\n\nThere are some signs of a pick-up in the market. Contracts to buy previously owned homes rose 2.8 per cent in June from the previous month, exceeding economists' forecasts, the National Association of Realtors reported on Tuesday.\n\nStill, the outlook is particularly bleak for first-time buyers. The number of new homeowners created in the second quarter was the lowest since 2006, and just a third as many as a year earlier, the Census Bureau reported last week. Black homeownership fell to the lowest level since at least 1970.\n\nUnequal recovery\n\nThe housing recovery that began in 2012 has been unequal from the start. About six million Americans lost homes in last decade's crash and needed time to rebuild their credit. Private equity firms such as Blackstone Group Inc. swept in to buy foreclosed properties at deep discounts and rented them back to many of those displaced former homeowners.\n\nNow those people are back in the market, along with the bulging population of millennials eager for their first crack at homeownership. But many of the properties they want have already been picked over.\n\nAffordable homes disappeared first in technology and financial hubs like Silicon Valley and New York, where buyers with big paycheques pushed up prices. Now values are flattening after many would-be homeowners have been forced to the sidelines.\n\nIn some areas, demand has also been hit by a pullback in foreign buyers and new federal limits on property-tax deductions, as well as fears that a recession may be around the corner.\n\nIn Louisville, fewer than one-fifth of listings were affordable to buyers in the bottom 30 per cent of incomes in April, according to Realtor.com, down from 23 per cent a year earlier. The trends are similar in other low-cost cities from Grand Rapids, Michigan, to Charleston, where only 6 per cent of listings meet that affordability threshold.\n\nClogged up\n\nLas Vegas, which was hit hard by the last crash and then sharply rebounded, now is seeing a rapid decline in sales because there's little on the low end worth buying. Many single-family houses were purchased by investors, and now are rentals, so there aren't enough owners of entry-level homes to move up to the next rung of the ladder, said Thomas Blanchard, president-elect of the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors.\n\n\"Our inventory is clogged up, causing a back-up of people that want to buy,\" he said. \"It's a self-fulfilling prophecy - nobody is willing to move anywhere because they're afraid they won't find a house to buy.\"\n\nMike Manesiotis, a 28-year-old who works in software sales in Charleston, wants to live in or near downtown, within a short walk or Uber ride to bars and restaurants, and pay less than US$350,000 - near the median price for a single-family home in the city. But he hasn't found anything he likes. The return of low mortgage rates hasn't helped.\n\n\"It's not the interest rate; it's the sheer cost,\" he said. \"You're spending US$300,000 on a home that's 1,000 square feet. You get two bedrooms, one bath and it needs a lot of work.\" BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM", "images": []}

Components sourced from parent companies in mainland Europe and Japan would also attract duties and cost more to buy.\n\n\"We don't see that as compensatory for the application of tariffs,\" SMMT chief executive officer Mike Hawes said in a briefing in London, referring to the weaker pound. Carmakers have already devoted at least \u00a3330 million (S$550 million) to no-deal preparations and will need to spend more in preparation for the latest Oct 31 deadline for the split, he said.\n\nThe likelihood of a hard Brexit has increased since Boris Johnson took over as prime minister last week. The former foreign secretary has said he will take the country out of the bloc by the deadline with or without an agreement. The pound fell to its lowest level in more than two years on Tuesday as markets became increasingly worried about that prospect.\n\nCarmakers have already been scaling back operations in the UK. Ford Motor is planning to close a UK engine factory as the last major step in an overhaul of its unprofitable European operations. Honda Motor is shuttering a plant in Swindon, west of London, employing 3,500 workers, while Nissan Motor no longer plans to build the X-Trail sport utility vehicle in Sunderland, northern England.\n\nCar production in the UK fell by a fifth in the six months through June compared to the same period in 2018, the SMMT said. Newly pledged investment also fell by more than 70 per cent to \u00a390 million in the same period and has effectively stalled, Mr Hawes said.\n\nThe CEO reiterated that a no-deal exit is the \"worst imaginable\" outcome for the auto industry and said that some companies would be less prepared for the Oct 31 deadline than they were for the original end-March leaving date. That's because they will not be able to repeat the tactic of bringing forward annual planned shutdowns, he said.

Digital leaders must balance innovation with data and tech, and get their workers future-ready.\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Jul 31, 2019 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nDESPITE jumping fast on board the digital train to keep up with the new-world dynamics, most businesses today find themselves in a quandary as they pause, look back and realise they haven't really gained much out of their digital transformation journey thus far.\n\nThe biggest stumbling blocks: Limited understanding of what it really means to go digital and the lack of a roadmap strategically designed to pave the way to digital success. What is most worrying however, is the paucity of digital leadership. Aside from the skills gap, we believe, it is this digital leadership deficit that will hurt Singapore businesses the most in the near future.\n\nWhat is digital leadership? It is all about fine balancing innovation, human insights and new technologies while preparing a future-ready workforce. It is about capitalising on data value to create unique people experiences. It simply refers to new ways of solving problems, creating unique customer and employee experiences and boosting businesses beyond financial performance. In doing all of this, digital leaders are able to tactfully toss disruptions into the transformation and scale new heights as they lead the digital revolution.\n\nIn contrast, many may have just about implemented technology across operations in the name of digital transformation - good, but not enough to survive, let alone thrive in the digital future.\n\nThe big questions then are: How can today's business leaders morph into digital leaders of tomorrow? Amid unprecedented business challenges and new risks, what must they do to secure the future of their business in today's digital-everything world?\n\nThe fundamental change businesses are coping with is the accelerated pace of change in the digital world. It is hence essential to first transform the internal dynamics: change people's mindset. This is happening, albeit slowly.\n\nMany leading businesses are beginning to consider failures to be the foundation of future success; several others are setting non-traditional management key performance indicators or KPIs that go beyond the financials. Companies and their boards are moving away from the culture of rewarding exact certainty, to celebrating experimentation.\n\nBusiness leaders must not hesitate to emulate such organisations, to create a culture that values mindset and innovation beyond profitability.\n\nIt is important to enable mindsets to look at things differently. For instance, even as we harness technology to grow our businesses, it is a good idea to use technology to meet the needs of people and their communities. Why not pursue technology to rejuvenate crumbling trade links between nations, as well as manage environmental issues for sustainable living?\n\nInnovation is building on what you have today and creating new, exciting and interesting models that shape the future. Who would have thought a phone would be making payments at the grocery stores?\n\nTo remain competitive and capture emerging opportunities, it is imperative to stimulate innovation. Technology can intensify and scale those innovations to create more value and improve customer experiences.\n\nFrom the outset, create a culture and vision that motivate innovative minds. Allow your people to generate ideas and develop them into something that works and creates value. It is key to align innovation with business goals and take a customer-first approach in driving innovation. Help your customers fulfill \"a need\" that they may not have yet imagined. Take a step further, ask and address what are your customers' needs.\n\nEngage with your innovators consistently and identify ways to make your innovations real.\n\nWork with teams across geographic locations and constantly enhance your ideas using external insights. Bring together a group of traditional and non-traditional skill sets, technologists and humanists, in ways traditional organisations would never think of.\n\nTechnology has radically driven change at work, from AI and automation to digital mobility, virtual collaboration and more. People are being pushed to acquire more and different new skills. Social and environmental pressures are creating demand for more flexible working conditions. These forces are making people insecure and anxious about the future of work, and how many or which jobs will be automated out of existence.\n\nCreate a strong narrative as to what the future of work means for the company and your people. Take workers along as you share the strategic direction and support them with reskilling or redeployment. Be transparent about the commercial pressures while still supporting your people.\n\nCultivate talent not replaceable by automation anytime soon, as these people will play a pivotal role in how your organisation develops, competes, innovates and, ultimately, drives success. Lead the collaboration between technology and humans, with an emphasis on harnessing human skills like creativity, empathy and ethics alongside digital skills.\n\nCreate engaging people experiences beyond training programmes and harness the potential of flexible talent from the wider labour market. Use workforce analytics to gauge future talent needs, create compelling people experiences and eliminate potential biases in selection, assignment and appraisal.\n\nTreating data as an asset, managing it well, curating and being aware of its value requires a focused strategy, and will be a strong determinant of future success. Design a robust corporate data strategy by defining the principles, priorities and purpose of the data valuation programme. Create enhanced capabilities around data management and data analytics to enable its monetisation. It will spur innovation, design new products, boosts customer relationships and experiences.\n\nIt is also important to implement data governance to enable trust in data. It ties people, processes and technology together to formalise data management throughout the data life cycle. Ensure data integrity and security as it underpins an organisation's ability to derive and drive value from data.\n\nHarbouring clean data is the only way to harness the AI opportunities. In today's digital-everything world, new technologies such as AI are defining what's next for companies, competitors and industries. PwC research shows that AI will add US$15.7 trillion to global GDP by 2030, which is more than the current output of China and India combined.\n\nWhat makes transformation-led growth unique include: i) the speed at which it is implemented, ii) the agility around delivering change through quick steps, iii) the rate of adoption and bringing people along, and iv) the trust that you build around your digital initiatives.\n\nBe a digital transformation leader. Given employees are fearful of losing jobs to machines, focus on optimising the human-technology relationship. Retrain and upskill to help employees shift to new roles and take on new activities.\n\nHelp employees make the digital transition by creating a narrative, a purpose and a culture that inspires people to create value. When employees feel supported, they respond with high levels of engagement and willingly bring in their intelligence, commitment, intuition and creativity to work.\n\nAs your company deep dives into digital transformation programmes, it is important to understand the vulnerabilities and how to proactively manage cyber and privacy risks. It is critical to build a digital trust environment. Digital world leaders must demonstrate how to lead with safety, security, reliability, privacy and data ethics.\n\nLeading the digital revolution\n\nYou don't need decades of experience to be a digital leader. That however, cuts both ways.\n\nFor sure, it makes identifying and breeding a pool of future digital leaders relatively easier. So, as you transform your business model, cultivate a pool of digital leaders across your organisation. As much as they are young, agile, tech-savvy future leaders who are re-imagining the possible, they must also be humanists, capable of blending creativity, empathy and ethics into their digital business models.\n\nOn the flip side, it leaves today's CEOs with no choice, but to stand out as digital champions, drive their business towards a successful future while leading the digital revolution.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These architects will oversee smart home projects and incorporate HOMI's products into these projects.\n\nThe startup believes that the absence of a proper smart home ecosystem in the region and the lack of smart home services result in low penetration rates for smart homes in Asia, it said in a press statement. This fuelled the firm to build products tailored to the Asian market.\n\n\"The culture of Do-It-Yourself (DIY) doesn't really exist. Therefore, we decided to focus on providing smart home services to help bridge the gap for consumers interested in getting a smart home. We believe that smart home services are key to the entire experience,\" Mr Dhillon said.\n\nHOMI aims to alleviate the current situation by offering customers an entire set of smart home products for the region with consultation, installation and support for about US$2 a day.\n\nPlans to launch a comprehensive suite of smart home products through affordable payment plans in the next quarter are underway. This will allow customers to customise their homes with devices that will include light switches, smart locks, cameras and modules to control various appliances. All of these will be controlled using one integrated app.\n\nFounded in 2017, HOMI seeks to address commonly overlooked aspects of creating a smart home, which revolve around set up and support. After receiving initial funding, the startup went on to introduce devices that could be installed by a certified electrician in a home within three hours.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its centre here is its only research institute outside Switzerland.\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Jul 31, 2019 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nSWITZERLAND'S top university, which has a presence here in Singapore since 2010, has been named the sixth best university in the world in the recently released latest edition of the closely watched QS World University Rankings.\n\nThis is the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, or ETH Zurich's best performance in a global university ranking. Moving up from 7th position in the previous prestigious ranking, it is once again the top ranked university outside the English-speaking world and in continental Europe. The university can count over 20 Nobel Prize laureates as alumni, including Albert Einstein.\n\nThe Swiss institute established the Singapore-ETH Centre (SEC) here in 2010. The centre was set up at the invitation of Singapore's National Research Foundation to be a part of its Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE), which is an international research campus and innovation hub.\n\nAs ETH Zurich's only research centre outside of Switzerland, the centre has strengthened the research capacity of ETH Zurich to develop sustainable solutions to global challenges, particularly in the context of the rapidly urbanising Asian region.\n\nETH Zurich president Joel Mesot says he sees three main reasons for the continued success of his institute.\n\nFirst is having excellent students and faculty. \"Students at ETH Zurich have to achieve a lot with a strong willingness to persevere. Our students develop critical thinking skills based on the fundamentals of mathematics and physics, which serve them well beyond their degrees. We know this because graduates of our university are in great demand in the job market and often reach positions of great responsibility,\" he says in an interview with The Business Times.\n\nSecond is intellectual freedom and autonomy. High-quality research can only be achieved in an environment with free competition of ideas and solutions, unhindered by external control and pressure, which are counterproductive. Research breakthroughs often occur at the margins of the disciplines, where they are not expected. Another condition that goes hand in hand is the unhindered access to the global talent pool, he adds.\n\nThe third prerequisite is strong support and secured funding. For more than 160 years, the Swiss parliament, government and society have been ensuring that ETH Zurich can concentrate on teaching and research of the highest quality and on the transfer of knowledge to society.\n\nETH Zurich has been actively involved in promoting and fostering scientific cooperation with key institutions in the Asia Pacific region as the leading house for the Swiss Science and Technology Programme with Asia since 2008.\n\n\"Setting up the Singapore-ETH Centre in 2010 has helped us to further broaden and strengthen our network in the Asian region,\" says Gerhard Schmitt, founding director of the Singapore-ETH Centre.\n\n\"The Asia-Pacific region is among the most dynamic regions of the world, with megacities like Shenzhen, Shanghai and Jakarta requiring innovative solutions to keep pace with their growth.\n\n\"Our presence in Singapore, therefore, also provides our students with a unique opportunity to be close to where rapid urbanisation is unfolding and where research plays an important role in informing and shaping more sustainable development and more resilient cities.\"\n\nProfessor Dr Schmitt says: \"Bringing together researchers from diverse disciplines, the centre provides a multidisciplinary, multicultural and collaborative environment for research and innovation.\n\n\"Our first research programme, the Future Cities Laboratory, combines science and design to shape a sustainable urban future with an Asian perspective. This is followed by the Future Resilient Systems programme, aimed at making infrastructure systems more resilient to ensure the reliable delivery of energy, transport, water, finance, and other critical services.\"\n\nResearchers at the centre actively collaborate with universities and research institutes, and engage with industry and government agencies to translate knowledge to practical solutions for real world problems.\n\nAs part of the CREATE programme, the centre also benefits from the opportunities to collaborate with centres established by Singapore and leading international universities. These include the National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Technical University of Munich, UC Berkeley, University of Cambridge, University of Illinois, and the French National Centre for Scientific Research.\n\nCurrently, SEC is looking at conducting research in the field of digital health.\n\n\"SEC is working on a research proposal on future health technologies. We feel that research in this area is timely as Singapore is actively looking at shaping the future of healthcare in the country. It aims to address healthcare challenges of the urban and ageing population by developing health technologies geared towards a people-centric healthcare model,\" says Prof Schmitt.\n\n\"The high level of digitalisation and digital literacy in Singapore makes it viable to bring the screening, monitoring, diagnosis and intervention of diseases outside of hospitals, and closer to patients through smart mobile digital health technologies.\n\n\"The research seeks to develop wearable sensors, wearable robotics, intelligent diagnostics and other health technologies to prevent falls and fractures, reduce diabetes and obesity, and rehabilitate stroke patients.\n\n\"To ensure that the new health technologies are meaningful for patients and can be integrated into the Singaporean healthcare system, we will work closely with local stakeholder groups and healthcare providers to test these technologies in proof-of-concept studies and ultimately in clinical trials.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Countries including Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam contest the territorial claims.\n\nChina has unnerved the region and angered the United States by installing military equipment and other facilities on artificial islands it has made by reclaiming land and building up reefs and shoals.\n\nResearchers and analysts say the latest standoff between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels could give the United States a new incentive to pressure China.\n\nBut they said China was unlikely to want to inflame the situation given its trade dispute with the United States and protests in Hong Kong.\n\n\"That tension right now going on between China and Vietnam will be the United States' anchor into making any statements on the South China Sea,\" said Jay Batongbacal, an expert on the South China Sea at the University of the Philippines.\n\n\"What China will be more concerned about is if the US tries to rally international support against China's activities,\" he said.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:54 PM\n\nSuspended Thailand PM Paetongtarn hit by ethics investigation, source and media say\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:07 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/1a0dd5ebd5cf27bbd28dfd3045f2cf635b56169817d4adfe289e21308a415214?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Chinese Councillor Wang Yi touted progress on an eventual Code of Conduct with the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) after meeting counterparts in the Thai capital."}]}

Now it's up to governments with more pro-active fiscal policy to step in as the ECB cannot do it alone.\"\n\nThe slower price growth comes even though the unemployment rate fell to 7.5 per cent of the workforce, its lowest in 11 years, data showed.\n\nMr Antonucci said the inflation and growth data, with downside risks for both, provided clear grounds for the ECB to push though a new package of measures as soon as September.

Pizza Hut sales also performed better than expected, the company reported in its second-quarter earnings.\n\nKFC comparable sales rose 5 per cent in the quarter, the company said Tuesday. Analysts had estimated a 3.9 per cent gain, according to Consensus Metrix. Pizza Hut same-store sales rose 1per cent -- higher than the 0.4 per cent estimate and a positive sign for a chain that's been a trouble spot for Yum China.\n\nKey Insights\n\nShanghai-based Yum China has been trying to turn around its Pizza Hut chain with faster delivery times, remodels and new desserts to entice customers. The chain has been looking to sister brand KFC to help it grow its digital presence as well. So far it's starting to work: it just logged its second straight same-store sales gain after four quarters of declines.\n\nThe company is facing more competition as the Chinese restaurant market gets increasingly crowded. Burger King, Tim Hortons and Starbucks Corp. are expanding quickly. But so is Yum China, which has said that expansion is a \"key priority.\" The company now expects 800 to 850 new locations this year across multiple brands, up from an earlier estimate of 650.\n\nYum China is facing higher food costs this year, especially for its key ingredient of chicken. That weighed on margins in the quarter, which were 14.7 per cent, compared with 15.1 per cent a year ago. The company also said it expects sales growth to moderate, as it faces comparisons with successful value campaigns that started in last year's second half.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nConsumer & Healthcare\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nChina biotech\u2019s stunning advance is changing the world\u2019s drug pipeline\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nWith medical costs under the microscope, IHH Healthcare group CEO continues to eye expansion\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\nJul 13, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nKraft Heinz explores grocery business spinoff worth up to US$20 billion: source\n\nJul 12, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM\n\nEven 190% tariffs can\u2019t shake US shoemaker\u2019s reliance on China\n\nJul 11, 2025 11:31 AM\n\nLevi sees revenue growth offsetting most of tariff impact\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:15 AM", "images": []}

The terrorism victims attempted for the first time to argue that social-media companies could be held liable under the US Anti-Terrorism Act.\n\nThe plaintiffs sued the company in federal court in New York in 2016, alleging it provided Hamas with a communications platform that enabled the attacks. A district judge dismissed the case in 2017, finding that the Communications Decency Act of 1996 prevents civil liability for claims that treat computer service providers or users as the publisher or speaker of information provided by someone else.\n\nThe appeals court said that if Facebook were even partly a creator or developer of the terrorism-related content, it wouldn't be protected under the law. But it disagreed with the plaintiffs' arguments that the company helped developed Hamas's content by directing it to users who are interested in the group and its terrorist activities even if they aren't seeking it.\n\n\"The algorithms take the information provided by Facebook users and 'match' it to other users - again, materially unaltered - based on objective factors applicable to any content, whether it concerns soccer, Picasso or plumbers,\" the court wrote.\n\nOne of three judges on the panel, Robert\u00a0 Katzmann, partly disagreed in a 35-page dissent, saying the decision takes a law intended to encourage service providers to shield minors from obscene material \"so that it now immunises those same providers for allegedly connecting terrorists to one another.\"\n\n\"Moreover, in part through its use of friend, group and event suggestions, Facebook is doing more than just publishing content: it is proactively creating networks of people,\" Judge Katzmann wrote. \"Its algorithms forge real-world (if digital) connections through friend and group suggestions, and they attempt to create similar connections in the physical world through event suggestions. The cumulative effect of recommending several friends, or several groups or events, has an impact greater than the sum of each suggestion.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:54 PM\n\nSuspended Thailand PM Paetongtarn hit by ethics investigation, source and media say\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:07 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/187b1593771d237314df444401d928ab23484d1e025613e2e1b524d226336337?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Facebook Inc doesn't have to face a lawsuit by victims of Hamas attacks and their relatives who claimed that the social network unlawfully assisted the terror group, a federal appeals court ruled."}]}

Now they will lose again,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Wednesday.\n\n\"They have not benefited much from the tourism boom, and with the relocation they will be isolated even more, despite evidence that local people help conservation efforts.\"\n\nGlobally, there is a growing awareness - and backlash against - the negative impacts of tourism, from environmental damage to the destruction of neighbourhoods as local residents are priced out.\n\nPoorer countries in Southeast Asia are particularly ill-equipped to limit the \"invisible burden\" of overtourism, according to a report earlier this year from The Travel Foundation charity in Britain.\n\nGrowing tourist numbers forced authorities in Thailand last year to close a beach made famous by the Leonardo DiCaprio film \"The Beach\" to give its ecosystem time to recover.\n\nThe Philippine holiday island of Boracay also shut for a clean-up last year after the president raged it had become a \"cesspool\" and warned of an environmental disaster.\n\nBut shutting down destinations is not the right approach unless it is an ecological emergency, said Megan Epler Wood, director of the International Sustainable Tourism Initiative at Harvard University.\n\n\"Relocation of villagers is a drastic act,\" she said.\n\nInstead, the system should be revamped to \"build local communities into the revenue generation process, and manage tourism flows,\" she said via email.\n\nKomodo National Park, a conservation area between the islands of Sumbawa and Flores, drew more than 176,000 tourists from across the world last year.\n\nThe park, a World Heritage Site, is home to more than 4,500 dragons which can grow to up to 3 metres in length.\n\nIt has seen a steady uptick in visitors as cruise ships made stops and a nearby airport was upgraded.\n\nVisitors have worsened pollution, damaged the ecosystem and driven up land prices, forcing local residents to abandon farming and make a living from selling souvenirs, said Cypri Jehan Paju Dale, a researcher on Indonesia at Bern University.\n\nIndigenous residents, who have held protests against the shutdown and relocation plan, had ensured a \"harmonious relationship of humans and animals\" for hundreds of years, he said.\n\nPlans to promote the park as a premium tourist destination would further hurt the community and conservation efforts, he said.\n\n\"The irony is that while the local community is relocated in the name of conservation, the park is exposed to the tourism business, with the economic benefits going to only big national and trans-national firms,\" he said.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nLifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}

But Levi's top executive says that really comes down to one main laggard: Sears.\n\nAlthough the jeansmaker reported earlier this month that its US wholesale business was down 2 per cent in the latest quarter, the business is healthier than it looks, said Levi Chief Executive Officer Chip Bergh. That key division would have been up 2 per cent excluding sales to Sears Holdings Corp. and the off-price retailers Levi has been intentionally weaning off.\n\n\"The one area that really concerned investors was our US wholesale business. Had we known the reaction that that was going to get, we would have done a much better job explaining what was going on,\" Mr Bergh said in an interview Tuesday at Bloomberg headquarters in New York.\n\nThe day after the Goldman downgrade, the stock sunk to its lowest level since its March IPO.\n\nSears used to be the San Francisco-based company's largest wholesale customer a decade ago. Now, Mr Bergh described the company as a \"shadow of itself.\"\n\nWholesale Reduction\n\nLevi has been reducing its dependence on wholesale customers overall, including at discount retailers like TJ Maxx and Ross -- where it can't get the same margins as in full-price stores. It has also become less reliant on struggling brick-and-mortar department stores contending with falling foot traffic. About eight years ago, the US wholesale business was 47 per cent of the company's overall business. At the end of fiscal year 2018, it contributed to just under a third worldwide, Mr Bergh said.\n\n\"What we've been telling investors is expect US wholesale to be choppy,\" Bergh said. \"There are customers that are challenged and struggling financially and still need to close stores. So it still is going to be bumpy.\"\n\nTo guard against this, Levi has been diversifying where it sells its products. It has started to offer premium merchandise at Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom, higher-priced retailers known more for their designer denim. Within the last year, it also launched six Macy's Inc. in-store shops where customers can buy directly from the jeans company and get help from Levi associates. Under the deal, Levi gives Macy's a percentage of the sales. That trial run could expand to 20 or 30 locations, Bergh said.\n\n\"It's not hundreds of doors,\" Mr Bergh said. \"But they're bigger, more important doors where we can demonstrate that we can lift the business by having service there in the pad.\"\n\nTarget Push\n\nThe Levi brand is also pushing into new big-box retailers like Target Corp. While Levi was already selling its Denizen brand in stores, Target now offers Levi-branded men's jeans at about 20 locations that sell for around US$50, about double the average pair of Target jeans. The inventory, which also includes tops and jackets, could expand to 50 Target stores or more.\n\n\"At full potential it's probably about 200 doors,\" Bergh said, noting that Levi jeans do best at Targets in urban centers and college towns. \"If you were to map the United States of where we've got distribution, many of these stores fill white spaces for us,\" he said.\n\nOutside of wholesale, Levi has also been expanding its own branded storefronts, adding about 100 company-operated stores globally this year, about two-thirds of which are outside the US It has also been increasing sales through its own website. Although its digital site isn't yet profitable, Mr Bergh says he's optimistic it will be by the end of next year.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nConsumer & Healthcare\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nChina biotech\u2019s stunning advance is changing the world\u2019s drug pipeline\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nWith medical costs under the microscope, IHH Healthcare group CEO continues to eye expansion\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\nJul 13, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nKraft Heinz explores grocery business spinoff worth up to US$20 billion: source\n\nJul 12, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM\n\nEven 190% tariffs can\u2019t shake US shoemaker\u2019s reliance on China\n\nJul 11, 2025 11:31 AM\n\nLevi sees revenue growth offsetting most of tariff impact\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:15 AM", "images": []}

In the electronics and precision engineering cluster, the weaker outlook is mainly due to the subdued demand for semiconductors and semiconductor-related equipment, as well as uncertainties arising from the US-China trade conflict that has broadened to the global technology sector.\n\nManufacturing - which makes up about one-fifth of Singapore's economy - has been roiled by uncertainties from the trade conflict, slowing demand in China, and the peaking of the semiconductor cycle in the past year.\n\nA separate survey by the Department of Statistics (Singstat) on the services sector, also released on Wednesday, showed the business expectations of services firms have moderated for the second half of 2019.\n\nSome 12 per cent of firms foresee slower business, while 14 per cent of firms are optimistic about business conditions. This results in a net weighted balance of 2 per cent of firms predicting a more favourable business outlook for the period of July to December 2019 - this is weaker than the 9 per cent recorded for the same period last year. It also eased from the 4 per cent seen in the previous quarter, which looked at business conditions for April to September 2019.\n\nWithin the services sector, the accommodation, food & beverages services, information & communications and transport & storage industries are among the more upbeat. Meanwhile, the retail trade, wholesale trade and financial & insurance industries are the least optimistic.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Healthy inflows of 9.5 billion francs (S$13.14 billion) into wealth management contrast with outflows at rival UBS Group. In the trading units, fixed income revenue gained 6 per cent, more than offsetting a 1 per cent drop in equities.\n\nSix months after emerging from Mr Thiam's painful turnaround, an industrywide slump in trading and the prospect of lower interest rates for longer are testing Credit Suisse's new business model. The CEO has pivoted the bank away from volatile investment banking and more toward wealth management, particularly in Asia, where most of the world's millionaires are created.\n\n\"It's been a good quarter for us,\" Mr Thiam said in an interview. The environment \"is very difficult, every quarter has been really mixed.\"\n\nShares of Credit Suisse rose 2.8 per cent at 9:20am in Zurich, bringing gains this year to 11 per cent.\n\nMr Thiam has held off on drastic job cuts announced this year by competitors including Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale. Credit Suisse said it saw \"healthy levels of client engagement\" so far this quarter, contrasting with warnings from peers that clients were staying on the sidelines and lower rates would hurt income from lending. Mr Thiam had earlier forecast that he was \"cautiously optimistic\" on the three-months through June.\n\nSHARING COSTS\n\n\"Negative interest rates are a challenge,\" Mr Thiam said in the interview with Bloomberg TV's Francine Lacqua. Credit Suisse will announce some measures in August to change pricing and protect income from lending, he said.\n\nLike rival UBS Group, Mr Thiam's bank has to pay the Swiss National Bank to park excess cash at home, but it's less affected than its larger neighbor by the reversal in US interest rates expectations, after exiting its US private banking operations in 2015.\n\nThe two bank have been exploring options to share back office costs, people familiar with the matter said last year. Mr Thiam confirmed those discussions on Wednesday, saying they continue and make good progress.\n\nBEATING PEERS\n\nNet income at Credit Suisse rose 45 per cent to 937 million francs, beating the analyst consensus of 788 million francs in a survey done by the bank. Credit Suisse said it has bought back 570 million francs from a total of a planned 1 billion francs of shares this year.\n\nAt the global markets unit, revenue from fixed income trading rose 11 per cent when reported in US dollars, and equities trading gained 3 per cent. The bank benefited from its skew towards fixed-income trading, which held up better across the industry. In Asia, fixed income trading slumped 29 per cent and equities trading fell 9 per cent.\n\nWall Street peers recorded 8 per cent lower equities revenue and a 7 per cent drop in fixed income, adjusting for a one-time effect. At local rival UBS, equities fell 9 per cent and fixed income 7 per cent. Only France's BNP Paribas SA recorded similar gains as Credit Suisse, with debt trading revenue rising almost 9 per cent in the second quarter.\n\nUBS relied on cost cuts and rising income from advising clients on deals and stock issuance to compensate for earnings disappointment at its most important private banking business, which contended with wealthy clients in the US withdrawing funds to pay tax bills, resulting in net outflows of US$1.7 billion.\n\nCredit Suisse earlier in July lost the head of its international wealth management unit Iqbal Khan, who was seen as a potential successor to the CEO. Mr Thiam said in the interview he was wishing Khan well and that the bank had found a very good successor in Philipp Wehle, the unit's former finance chief.\n\nCompetition for the best private bankers has been increasing as numerous lenders follow the lead of UBS in building up their wealth management. Deutsche Bank hired a team of around a dozen private bankers from Credit Suisse earlier in July. The German lender offered some bankers pay increases of up to 40 per cent, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM", "images": []}

This was the sixth straight month that the segment saw a decline, and the magnitude has enlarged from the 0.1 per cent month-on-month and the 0.3 per cent year-on-year contraction seen in May.\n\nThis was borne out by the contraction seen in the Republic's biggest housing loan lender DBS's mortgage book. The bank, with a 31 per cent share of the local market, experienced a further decline in housing loans in April to June, after its first drop in years in the January-March quarter. But bookings have gone up by 60 per cent as compared to the January-March quarter. The effect of the S$2.5 billion worth of new bookings would only be reflected in the bank's balance sheet in subsequent quarter(s).\n\nThe government implemented measures last year to cool the \"exuberant\" property market in Singapore, tempering demand and sentiment as a result.\n\nTotal consumer lending also declined on the back of weaker housing loans - which make up about three-quarters of total consumer loans, down 0.1 per cent month on month to S$263.58 billion. Compared to a year ago, the drop was 0.6 per cent.\n\nIn contrast, loans to businesses came in strong at S$423.5 billion in June, up 1.3 per cent month on month and 3.8 per cent year on year.\n\nThanks to business loans, total loans momentum was maintained with the same magnitude of increase - 0.8 per cent month on month and 2.1 per cent year on year - to S$687.08 billion.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Many say the US economy does not need additional stimulus.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell is due to announce the outcome of the latest two-day policy meeting on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nBut others see on the horizon a slowdown in China's growth, the European Union on the brink of an unknown Brexit outcome, added to a drop off in US business investment and rising corporate debt levels, and say the Fed is right to retreat for now.\n\nMohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, said \"unwinding\" the December increase in the Fed's benchmark lending rate will put the central bank back \"where some of us thought it should be going into 2019.\"\n\nAnd, he said on Twitter, \"the Fed's dramatic dovish pivot has opened the way/forces other central banks to also loosen monetary policy.\"\n\nThe European Central Bank, which has held the policy interest rate at zero, indicated it is ready to provide more stimulus - even turning rates negative - as did the central banks of Britain and Japan.\n\nThe Fed in the past has for the most part been ahead of the curve, cutting quickly as the global financial crisis erupted in late 2007, and then raising rates as the United States began to recover before other advanced economies.\n\nROLLER COASTER\n\nThe Fed's goal with its nine increases since December 2015 - bringing the range to 2.25-2.5 per cent - was to get rates high enough to keep the recovery going while also allowing it room to cut in the event of another economic slowdown.\n\nThe Commerce Department on Tuesday confirmed that inflation remained tame last month, meaning policymakers have little reason to fear a breakout in price pressures even with low rates.\n\n\"Unfortunately, last 8 months' roller-coast(er) journey has exposed the world's most powerful central bank to a larger set of threats to operational autonomy/policy credibility,\" Mr El-Erian said.\n\nOne complication has been Mr Trump's unrelenting campaign against the Fed's efforts to normalise policy. He wants credit to flow freely to supercharge economic growth going into presidential election season next year.\n\n\"I would like to see a large cut,\" Mr Trump told reporters on Tuesday. \"I'm very disappointed in the Fed.\"\n\nBut the drop off in business investment, setbacks in manufacturing, and falling exports have been attributed to Trump's barrage of tariffs against China and others, that have created uncertainty.\n\nSome economists expect the Fed to cut as much as twice more in the coming months.\n\nHowever, several former central bank officials, including Janet Yellen who preceded Jerome Powell as Fed chair, have said they support a single rate cut as insurance against a downturn.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:54 PM\n\nSuspended Thailand PM Paetongtarn hit by ethics investigation, source and media say\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:07 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM", "images": []}
