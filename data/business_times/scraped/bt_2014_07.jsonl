On Tuesday, two different numbers from Twitter's second-quarter results fought for investor attention: its net loss of US$145 million based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), versus its non-GAAP net income of US$14.6 million that came about when a hefty stock-based compensation expense was excluded. Non-GAAP appeared to triumph over GAAP. Twitter's share price soared 29 per cent after hours, that day.\n\nNon-GAAP metrics are not new or uncommon, but tech firms tend to go the furthest with them. Some exclude large stock-based compensation expenses. Others exclude acquisition-related ones. The gulf between GAAP and non-GAAP realities can be significant.\n\nOne study found that 56 tech firms reported non-GAAP income that was 23 per cent higher than their GAAP earnings on average, in 2011 and 2012. Investors also tend to give non-GAAP numbers more credence than usual because of all the unknowns that loom on a tech firm's horizon. On top of that, today's tech firms have popularised non-financial metrics that have evolved into key measures.\n\nOn Tuesday, another number that excited investors was Twitter's monthly active users (MAUs) figure, which grew 24 per cent to 271 million.\n\nThe microblogging site is not the only platform whose MAUs have been made a proxy for monetisation potential. Facebook, WhatsApp and WeChat also have MAUs that are closely watched. When Twitter went public last year, it also had a metric in its filing that raised many eyebrows: \"advertising revenue per 1,000 timeline views\", used in lieu of the more conventional \"average revenue per user\" (ARPU).\n\nThis week, the former was reported matter-of-factly; ad revenue per 1,000 timeline views was up 100 per cent for the second quarter. This metric had - just nine months after causing incredulity during Twitter's listing filing - joined the ranks of the oft-cited. It might eventually follow in the footsteps of the ARPU, which has achieved informal legitimacy.\n\nWhether an unconventional metric is accepted more for its robustness than for the mere passage of time and frequency of use, only shareholder returns will tell. There is a place for all kinds of metrics. GAAP earnings are valued because, by and large, they allow comparability between firms, but are also seen to understate earnings. Non-GAAP or non-financial measures, however, help investors take into account how two firms are different, but can be prone to abuse.\n\nThe truth, like all truths, is worth getting at, and it lies somewhere between the two approaches. But in the tech industry, where one magnate indirectly popularised the term \"reality distortion field\", actually arriving at the truth might take much more work.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The global economic recovery bodes well for some, even as domestic labour and property-related policies are dampening the business sentiment of others.\n\nFor the services sector, a weighted 21 per cent of the 1,500 firms polled by the Department of Statistics (DoS) between June and mid-July expect business to pick up in the coming six months, up from 15 per cent of those polled in April. The proportion of pessimistic firms also dipped to 8 per cent, from 10 per cent a quarter earlier.\n\nTaking the difference between the share of optimistic and pessimistic firms, DoS derives a measure it terms the net weighted balance. This was a positive 13 per cent for the six months ending in December, a jump from the net weighted 5 per cent that felt positive about the April to September period.\n\nBut manufacturers have become less optimistic.\n\nThe Economic Development Board's (EDB) survey of 410 manufacturing companies between June and July showed that a net weighted balance of 6 per cent are positive about the next six months - down from 7 per cent a quarter ago.\n\nOnly 9 per cent expect business to improve, down from 12 per cent of manufacturers polled in April. This offset the drop in the share of pessimistic manufacturers to 3 per cent in the latest survey, from 5 per cent in the previous poll.\n\nThe global economic recovery drove the positive outlook for some, such as the banks. A net weighted 25 per cent of those in financial and insurance services expect brighter prospects over the next six months.\n\nImproved economic conditions in the US and Asia also underpin the higher orders forecast by machinery and systems and precision modules and components companies, EDB said. These contributed to a net weighted 11 per cent of precision engineering firms projecting better business, making precision engineering the most optimistic industrial cluster.\n\nSimilarly, better global economic conditions are expected to lift orders for manufacturers in the aerospace and land segments, while marine and offshore engineering firms are set to benefit from higher demand for oil rigs and more oil and gas-field equipment orders.\n\nFor some other business sectors though, domestic constraints trump any impact better global economic conditions may have.\n\nReal estate was by far the most gloomy sector - a net weighted balance of 23 per cent of firms expect business to decline in the second half of 2014. Property demand continues to be dampened by policy measures levying additional stamp duties on home buyers and stricter home loan rules (the total debt servicing ratio).\n\nRestaurants continue to struggle against a shortage of labour - in part due to tighter foreign manpower policies - resulting in a net weighted 5 per cent of food and beverage firms which are pessimistic.\n\nFor a couple of sectors, the change in sentiment was more seasonal.\n\nAccommodation was the most optimistic services segment, with a net weighted 37 per cent of firms expecting business to improve. DoS noted that hotels tend to expect a higher business volumes in September, as the Formula One race rolls into town then.\n\nThe chemicals cluster, meanwhile, was the most pessimistic manufacturing cluster with a net weighted 3 per cent of firms expecting business to worsen. But this was largely due to plant maintenance shutdowns that the specialties segment is expecting in the second half, EDB said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

According to Liu Thai Ker, Singapore should not stop its population growth projection at the figure of 6.9 million listed in the 2013 White Paper on Population.\n\n\"That is an interim figure and projection and obviously Singapore is going to grow beyond that,\" he said yesterday at a seminar, \"Building a Nation: Tomorrow, Challenges and Possibilities for a Liveable Singapore\".\n\nAs architect-planner and CEO of the Housing Development Board from 1969 to 1989, Mr Liu oversaw the completion of over half a million public housing units, and as CEO and chief planner of the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) from 1989 to 1992, he spearheaded the major revision of the Singapore Concept Plan and key direction for heritage conservation.\n\n\"The question is: How long do you want Singapore to exist as a sovereign state? Certainly beyond 2030, so we should plan for the longer term and for this 10 million figure as we cannot curb population growth after 2030.\"\n\nMr Liu explained that it was necessary for Singapore to plan for the longer term than for the 17 years it had planned for in the White Paper. He suggested that even though Singapore has a lot of land to be reclaimed and there is a lot of land set aside for industrial purposes that can be converted for other use, it is still better to plan for the long term so that there is a better estimate of the amount of land that is required.\n\n\"So if we need to reclaim more land from the sea, we can plan for it and do so.\"\n\nConversely, Mr Liu argued that shorter-term population planning would result in higher density as each time the population projection is made, the government may increase land density as it does not have a longer-term view of the amount of land that may be needed and that it has available. \"Overall, this results in Singapore's land density increasing.\"\n\nMr Liu told BT that the 10 million figure was projected on how much Singapore could grow long term for the next 80-150 years at a population growth rate of less than one per cent each year. He said that if the growth rate were based on the upper limit of the projection of the 2013 White Paper, at 6.9 million, then Singapore could reach a population of 10 million by 2090. If however, it is based on the lower limit of 6.5 million then we may reach 10 million by 2200.\n\nThe director of RSP Architects & Engineers since 1992 and the founding chairman of the Centre for Liveable Cities said that, over time, Singapore's growth rate could contract with education, technology and productivity gains as is the case of the Scandinavian countries, which are small like Singapore, but still managed to achieve economic growth with a population growth of less than one per cent per year.\n\nBut this will take time, he added, as Singapore was not as mature as those economies and therefore still needed immigration to grow its population.\n\nEven though he acknowledged that Singaporeans may be uncomfortable with the thought of the country ever having a population of 10 million, Mr Liu believes that it is better for the country to anticipate this and to plan for it so that the adjustment can be smoother.\n\n\"If you look at from 1960 till now, Singapore's land density has tripled but even with that, we have built a good environment through more skills and knowledge. So if we can do it then, Singaporeans should believe that we now have the ability to solve these problems and that we will have a good environment even though population density may increase.\"\n\nChew Hock Yong, CEO of the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and a panellist at the seminar, noted that while this projection of 10 million is Mr Liu's personal view, it will guarantee a critical mass for Singapore to thrive economically and in other areas. However, he admitted that there is a consideration of the human dimension and whether Singaporeans would be able to adjust to having twice the number of people and what kind of city-state they would like to live in. The seminar was organised by The Business Times in collaboration with Singapore Institute of Building Limited. It was supported by Hitachi and co-hosted by InterContinental Singapore.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The top Chablis are like the top wines of the Cote d'Or; difficult to find, and quite expensive relative to other Chablis.\n\nBut leaving aside the very top ones, there are innumerable good to very fine Chablis at affordable prices. Nonetheless, among local wine lovers though, and I stress \"local\", it is a rare occasion to be served a Chablis at dinner!\n\nChablis is the northernmost appellation of Burgundy, which may explain why it tends to escape the attention of burgundy seekers. Curious to learn more about Chablis early in my Burgundy learning curve some 25 years ago, I visited Chablis and sought out a few of the top producers. Chablis is a small town, its best hotel there being Hostellerie des Clos whose restaurant we found to be quite good then - and judging from the Michelin Guide, it still is!\n\nAt the time too, there was quite a bit of discussion going on in the wine press, that Chablis producers were divided into two camps, those who used wood for ageing and those who did not. The first group consisted of only two at the time, Raveneau and Dauvissat. All the others were in the no-wood group.\n\nI made sure I visited representative producers of both groups. Raveneau is to Chablis what Romanee Conti is to Cote d'Or. Their wines are regarded with the same awe (and the same stratospheric prices) as DRC's wines.\n\nChablis Grand Cru Vaudesir 1988, Joseph Drouhin\n\n(Purchased 1992, Singapore agent Hock Tong Bee; drunk July 27, 2014.)\n\nMedium-gold colour, surprisingly light for its age. Very fine, very lovely light aroma of citrus and nuts; bright youthful taste on the palate; a little short I thought. Lovely drink notwithstanding. What impressed was its youthfulness despite being 26 years old.\n\nA bottle of Chablis Grand Cru Vaudesir 1986, Joseph Drouhin drunk a year ago was just as fresh. The current price of Drouhin's Chablis Vaudesir 2011 is S$123. A very modest price for a Grand Cru white burgundy from a very reputable producer.\n\nIt is not generally known that Joseph Drouhin, Louis Jadot, Joseph Faiveley and Bouchard Pere et Fils, known usually as negociants, or wine merchants, are also major vineyard owners in Burgundy. In reality, they are Negoce-Domaines.\n\nDrouhin has extensive holdings throughout Burgundy, including Chablis in which they own parcels in most of the Grands Crus. I have happily found that Chablis from anyone of them to be true to character, and best of all, value for money. Bouchard Pere et Fils acquired ownership of one of Chablis's best known producers, William Fevre in 1998.\n\nChablis can taste very dry, and minerally. I have found that Chablis Premiers Crus need at least five years before becoming anywhere near drinkable. With Grands Crus, it takes at least seven years, preferably more. Both Premiers and Grands Crus benefit hugely from much longer storage, preferably 15 or more years. The problem, quite simply, is storage capacity - which could mean some investment in storage facilities!\n\nThe white burgundies from the Maconnais district, Pouilly Fuisse and Macon, are wonderful value. I like in particular the Macons (as expressed by Leflaive and Lafon). Clean pure chardonnay character, good density and freshness, very inexpensive at prices around the S$50 mark for the Macons, and not much more for the Pouilly-Fuisse.\n\nPOUILLY-FUISSE\n\nis another white burgundy that is seldom seen, if at all. It is well worth exploring. Softer and a bit richer than Chablis, it should have better appeal than the latter.\n\nPouilly-Fuisse 1990, Chateau de Fuisse\n\n(Bought from London in the early 90s, \u00a318 per bottle. Drunk three nights ago.)\n\nDeep yellow; fresh nutty bouquet with citrus edge, lovely wine, mature, toasty; has an edge that Bourgogne does not have. Very good. Still at peak. A very enjoyable wine, showing no signs of age.\n\nPouilly-Fuisse Vieilles Vignes 1983, Chateau de Fuisse\n\n(Bought 1988, Wine Society, England \u00a319.)\n\nDrunk Aug 28, 2008: deep golden colour, fully mature rich bouquet, balanced, still fresh. A very intense wine, too rich for the fish course.\n\nJust two of many examples of Pouilly-Fuisse from perhaps the best, certainly the most well-known producer, Jean-Jacques Vincent of Chateau de Fuisse. Both wines were more than 20 years old, another example of the ageing potential of these wines.\n\nFor those who find Chablis too linear, too tight and even severe, Pouilly Fuisse is a worthwhile wine to consider. The wines are bigger-bodied, softer and fruitier than Chablis. The appellation is situated at the bottom of the Maconnais, its area dominated by its landmark, the high limestone hill, Solutre, on the top of which is a very charming and quite good restaurant. This is an area which is very charming, not too far from Beaune, and producing very good inexpensive burgundies.\n\nAnother asset they have over Chablis is their drinkability even when young, although as shown by the above examples they are, like Chablis, very age-worthy.\n\nChateau de Fuisse\n\nThis is more or less the acknowledged top producer in Pouilly-Fuisse, its unofficial First Growth! It has been in the Vincent family since 1862.\n\nAt the time, around 1990, when I visited the property, we were warmly received by Jean-Jacques Vincent. Both the regular Pouilly Fuisse and the Vieilles Vignes bottlings are well worth taking a good look at. Both are available locally at prices well below S$100.\n\nRegretfully, I have to confess to total ignorance of Pouilly Fuisse by other producers. Given the almost total absence of even Chateau de Fuisse's wines on the table, one can hardly expect to see any other producer's Pouilly Fuisse in Singapore, except of course those from the big negoce-domaine houses of Drouhin, Jadot, Faiveley, Louis Latour and Bouchard Pere.\n\nMore next week\n\nNote: Chateau de Fuisse's wines can be obtained from Vinum's Caveau Chablis can taste very dry, and minerally.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

You can literally trace the history of China - even the world - with it, as a new exhibition at the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) seeks to do.\n\nPorcelain dates as far back as the 9th century, when it was a major source of export trade for China.\n\nIt was sold to the likes of Europe and South-east Asia, in the process documenting the cultural interactions and influences over the centuries.\n\nExplains ACM director Alan Chong: \"Porcelain was seen as something magical, special and unobtainable. It was highly prized for its decoration and the brightness of its colours. Everyone struggled to make imitations of it.\"\n\nTo trace the importance of porcelain and its role in history, over 180 pieces from all over the world will go on show at the ACM from tomorrow till December in China Mania! The Global Passion for Porcelain, 800- 1900.\n\nAlong with the original Chinese pieces on display are imitations made in other places like Vietnam and Europe.\n\n\"The iPhone and Samsung war is nothing compared to the 16th and 17th century,\" says Dr Chong. \"People copied each other, trying to corner the market and dominate the trade and export. People made a lot of money from porcelain and it was a very lucrative commodity. It was for centuries something that Europe could not produce,\" he points out.\n\nDr Chong hopes that, besides allowing visitors to learn about the struggle for world porcelain dominance, the exhibition will also help them appreciate how the world has been trading for a very long time, and how economic exchanges are another way in which cultures influence one another.\n\nIn some cases, the porcelain wares made for exporting overseas have even influenced the ones made for the domestic market.\n\nSome examples include white figurines of the Virgin Mary, which were meant for the European market. But along the way, these figurines morphed into images of Guanyin (the Chinese goddess of mercy) to cater to domestic demand.\n\nSays Dr Chong: \"This exhibition is trying to show the dynamics of the trade. It started very early, it was wider than we suspected, and there are all kinds of interesting stories about how individual cultures wanted certain kinds of things.\"\n\n\"The rest of the world wanted not only the physical substance (porcelain), they also wanted the Chinese decoration . . . these people didn't want to avoid China. They wanted to collect a part of it,\" he adds.\n\n'China Mania! The Global Passion for Porcelain, 800-1900' runs from tomorrow to Dec 14 at the Asian Civilisations Museum. Opening hours are 10am to 7pm daily, and 10am to 9pm on Fridays. Admission is free for Singaporeans and PRs. Log on to\n\nwww.acm.org.sg\n\nor call 6332-7798 for more information\n\nEXHIBITION HIGHLIGHTS\n\nINCENSE BURNER\n\nOne of the most significant pieces in the exhibition is this horse-shaped incense burner made up of multiple components from different parts of the world. Though the entire piece was assembled in Europe, the porcelain horse came from China, the red lacquer bowls from Japan, and the bronze mounts from France.\n\nSET OF FIVE BOAR-SHAPED DISHES\n\nRustic-looking Chinese porcelain dishes like these were often used in meals that accompanied Japanese tea ceremonies. This particular set came from the 17th century.\n\nBOAR'S HEAD TUREEN WITH STAND\n\nFancy drinking your soup out of a boar's head? Many Europeans did just that in the 18th century, with Chinese porcelain tureens shaped like geese, ducks, chickens, fish and boars.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He includes this video as part of his new solo exhibition at Yavuz Fine Art, titled Machine for (Living) Dying In, where the overall aim is to look into the notion of Home as well as the uncertainties surrounding its concept.\n\nHome is as specific as the 20th place of residence he's stayed at in Singapore. Or it could be the sense of comfort one might find in less homey places, like public spaces you encounter on your travels. \"Home doesn't have to be defined in a physical way,\" he notes.\n\nBut how does the video, with its macabre theme, mesh with the notion of Home? Lee chuckles, saying that in his view it's actually a very optimistic piece. \"For a start, we need to understand why people are not comfortable or don't like to engage in the topic of death. And then there's the idea that one of the KPIs (key performance indicators) of a good life is to die with friends and relatives surrounding you on your deathbed.\"\n\nWhat spurred this video work was news of the death of his former army mate in 2012. \"He was younger than me. It was winter in Berlin when I read the report, cold and alone. In a sense, I was in a situation that could have landed me in the same predicament,\" he recalls.\n\nHis exhibition title was inspired by the two architects Le Corbusier and Douglas Darden, and their definitions of house and home. Le Corbusier, for example, defined a house as a \"machine for living in\". Darden, 70 years later, said that a house is for dying in. That morbid thought came from his unbuilt proposal for a client with chest injuries, who requested that an oxygen pump be built into the house that could be connected to his chest, so that when he died, the pump would stop.\n\n\"On the one hand, we often think of home as being safe and comfortable, but the other aspect of reality is that it's the place where we die a bit each day,\" muses Lee.\n\nFocusing on space as a metaphor for physical existence and as a reflection of humanity, Lee's show is deliberately raw. He's also deviated from his usual style with a collage series titled Hazards, with a message that one is not safe anywhere, even in the sanctity of one's own home. In Slab, he rearranges everyday furniture into three-dimensional puns, such as a reference to public housing blocks. Script for an Unperformed Performance features a hammock tied across two pillars in the gallery and text that is painted on the wall describing a series of mundane activities or actions.\n\nIf it all looks very disparate, it's meant to be. After all, by creating collages, \"I collect information and make connections between unrelated things - hopefully, there's some sense of reality that can be felt by the audience\".\n\n'Machine for (Living) Dying In' by Michael Lee will show at Yavuz Fine Art, 51 Waterloo Street, #03-01, from Aug 16 to Sept 21. The artist will hold a tour of the exhibition on Aug 16, from 2-4pm.

The latter is about capturing and sharing beautiful and powerful moments with the world; Bolt is about quickly sharing those fun and meaningful moments (that just can't wait) with people you're close to.\"\n\nContent on Bolt does not stick around forever too; once users have seen a photo or video, they can literally swipe it away, and it will be deleted for good.\n\nThe app has been available for download here on Apple's App Store and Google Play since Wednesday. Users can also expect to see install ads on Instagram and Facebook, prompting them to download Bolt.\n\nApart from Singapore, Bolt is making its debut in New Zealand and South Africa too.\n\n\"We chose these countries as they are diverse and primarily English-speaking. While the US is, of course, our biggest market, the international market is important too - over 65 per cent of our users are outside the US,\" said the spokeswoman.\n\nInstagram has chosen to start small with Bolt, so it can pay special attention to its first group of users and ensure it gets the experience in the app just right.\n\nDaniel Chia, a Singaporean entrepreneur and founder of social networking app BlastOut, said: \"I think Bolt is a great idea, because it's something like Snapchat and the new features make peer-to-peer photo messaging even more efficient. But it will be interesting to see how Bolt grows. Because its core concept is still temporal photo sharing with friends, whether you use Bolt depends on what your friends are already using.\"\n\nSnapchat, a mobile app that allows users to capture and share photos or videos (known as \"snaps\") that self-destruct after a few seconds, is recently reported to be in talks with Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba for a financing round that would value the company at US$10 billion, according to a Bloomberg report citing anonymous sources.\n\nBlastOut, which lets users create their own private temporary social networks around an event (where they can connect and share content anonymously with people nearby), is valued at S$2 million in venture capital terms, said Mr Chia.\n\nFor now, Bolt does not have any monetisation plans and says it is focused on building user experience first.\n\nLikewise, Instagram launched in 2010 with no monetisation plans. But four years and an acquisition later, the unprofitable 200 million user-strong service announced that it should be ready to begin selling ads next year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And with global interest rates set to rise only next year, there is no pressing need for the Singapore government to lift its cooling measures now, according to market watchers at the Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore (Redas) property market update seminar.\n\n\"There is no shortage of liquidity now, which is an issue, because everyone is waiting for that 10-15 per cent decline in property prices,\" said Song Seng Wun, executive director and regional economist at CIMB Research, noting that a lot of liquidity in Asia is now waiting on the sidelines.\n\nThis is keeping the government from lifting its cooling measures on the property market before the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates. The Fed hike, however, may come sooner than expected given the recent positive economic data in the US, Mr Song predicted.\n\nFor now, developers will have to contend with the double whammy of falling residential prices and rising land costs as a result of a reduction of residential land supply in the second half of the Government Land Sales programme.\n\nAlso speaking at the seminar, Chua Yang Liang, head of research for South-east Asia and Singapore at JLL, noted that the government has historically intervened in periods when the property price movement deviates from economic growth by a certain margin. He is expecting the government to step in when the gap between the change in the property price index and GDP growth is wider than two percentage points and deems a 10-15 per cent price correction by 2016 \"an acceptable level\".\n\nIn the absence of any further government intervention, home sale volumes are likely to stay tepid and this market adjustment could be prolonged, Dr Chua said.\n\nResidential prices started to correct only in the third quarter of 2013 after the total debt servicing ratio was introduced, as earlier cooling measures had short-lived impact on residential sales by developers.\n\n\"In this environment,\" said Mr Song, \"unless you see a huge external shock that triggers a crisis of confidence, that triggers cashflow problems for businesses and households, the government is quite happy to keep the total debt servicing ratio in place. I don't think that is going to disappear.\"\n\n\"What will happen is that it may be tweaked. And how much it may be tweaked will depend on whether the economy is still generating jobs. Broadly speaking, we are seeing fundamentals still supporting the property market,\" he added, referring to rising wages and the full employment situation in Singapore.\n\nMeanwhile, the office sector is holding up well with healthy business formations even though businesses are facing a tight labour market and wage inflation, property consultants at the seminar observed.\n\nToby Dodd, managing director at Cushman & Wakefield, said at the seminar that he expects office rents to rise in 2014 and 2015 and occupancy rates to improve on the back of tight supply of prime grade space in the next two years. He forecast that net demand would exceed 1.5 million square feet by end-2016, underpinned by economic growth and a positive business outlook. While he expressed optimism on the plan to decentralise commercial activities to regional centres outside the city centre, he stressed that it would require the right price offerings and discounts to draw tenants from the CBD to these new commercial clusters.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Century-old chandeliers and antique cabinets are not exactly in keeping with the populist de Blasio image.\n\nSo to smooth their transition into grander confines, the de Blasios turned to a decorator that better reflected their unpretentious style: West Elm.\n\nA popular Brooklyn-based purveyor of on-trend home pieces, West Elm said on Wednesday that it had donated US$65,000 worth of furniture so New York's first family could reimagine the mansion's upstairs residential quarters.\n\nOut: an exquisitely hand-carved, Dutch-inspired cupboard, circa 1690. In: Capiz orb pewter pendant lights, circa 2014.\n\nThe newly casual rooms feature plain, midcentury-style sofas and striped accent beanbags, and are a stark contrast with the baroque look installed by Gracie's last decorator, the celebrity designer Jamie Drake, who was paid US$7 million by former mayor Michael Bloomberg to refurbish the mansion in 2002.\n\nThe latest redesign was overseen by Mr de Blasio's wife, Chirlane McCray, who has shopped at West Elm for the family's home in Park Slope. \"She really was gravitating toward the midcentury look,\" said Johanna Mele, a stylist at West Elm who worked with Ms McCray on the project.\n\nGracie Mansion, Ms Mele said, \"is very heavy, ornate, and that doesn't represent the family's style at all; they've got a simpler, fresher vibe.\"\n\nOn a recent morning, Ms McCray and the couple's children, Chiara and Dante, took a private tour of West Elm's Chelsea showroom before it opened to the public, the company's standard practice for high-profile clients. \"It was such a cool opportunity for them to come in and pick out their dream home,\" Ms Mele said.\n\nSome accommodations had to be made for the mayor's 6-foot-6 frame. Sofa depth was a prized asset, and the family picked out large desk chairs for support.\n\nMr De Blasio and his aides are determined to be low-key about his move from the family's unadorned Park Slope rowhouse, which became a symbol of his populist campaign, to Gracie Mansion, with its Upper East Side setting and domestic staff.\n\nGracie d\u00e9cor has proved a thorny subject for its residents. Mr De Blasio's old boss, former mayor David Dinkins, faced tabloid turmoil after it emerged that the city had spent US$11,500 to handcraft a custom headboard for the mayoral bed.\n\nThe cost for the de Blasios' furniture was covered by West Elm, which earned a fair amount of product placement from the exchange. Images of the mayor's new living area were posted on the West Elm website, with commentary by the company's creative director.\n\nOutside observers gave the design decent reviews on Wednesday, saying it was pleasing, if generic. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

It is every bit as nonchalant as the title (named after a 1990 Billy Joel song) sounds and the lukewarm script by Mark Andrus - who also penned James L Brook's similarly-themed As Good As It Gets (1997) - could have used at least a dozen more jokes to keep things from going downhill fast.\n\nAll this despite enjoyable performances from old-timers Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton; possibly the only two reasons to catch this. The former lets loose as a grumpy old man who appears hard on the outside but is, as you've guessed it, soft as marshmallow on the inside.\n\nIn one of the film's most ludicrous scenario, this bad-a** actually helps a neighbour whom he's more used to squabbling with, deliver her baby. (It's not Douglas' fault for choosing to be in this movie; it's his agent's and Andrus'.)\n\nKeaton's character might go down a little easier with the audience though she's often guilty of playing it a little too cute for someone her age; that's something perhaps best left to child star Sterling Jerins - from TV's Deception and last seen on the big screen as Brad Pitt's daughter in the zombie apocalypse thriller World War Z - who plays Douglas' granddaughter.\n\nGood thing Keaton adds a charming comic edge to character - that of a jazz singer who can get a little emotionally overwhelmed by the sad lyrics of the songs she croons - so the cringe factor is kept to a bare minimum.\n\nAs an on-screen couple, the Douglas-Keaton pairing lights up the screen and they have an easy chemistry with each other despite Andrus' tired script introducing the romance between them very late in the film. Too much time instead is spent on building Oren (Douglas) into the guy you want to hate by making him an all-round meanie who seems to have a bad day in the office ... everyday.\n\nThere is, of course, a \"good\" reason behind all this behaviour - Oren has lost his zest for life after years of caring for and then eventually watching his wife pass away. For closure, the real estate agent has one final deal on his hands which he'd like to see through personally - to sell his own family home.\n\nThings get a little more complicated when his estranged ex-junkie son, Luke (Scott Shepherd), shows up to drop off his daughter, Sarah (Jerins) with her grandfather before he starts his prison sentence. Oren doesn't know any better what to do with her so he leaves things to his neighbour, Leah (Keaton) to care for the little girl.\n\nIt gets predictable from here, and before the film's brief-but-strangely-draggy 94-minute running time is up, Leah brings out the good in Oren while he also teaches her a lesson or two in building her self-esteem.\n\nReiner directs with heart and his lead actors display plenty of it even with the lacklustre plot in their hands.\n\nAnd So It Goes might work as a nice little made-for-television movie but on the big screen, it comes across as a missed opportunity and a waste of everybody's star wattage.\n\nRating:\n\nC\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The remaining 350 million yuan of the project cost will be funded by bank borrowings.\n\nSaid CEFC CEO Zang Jian Jun: \"The entry into the oil storage business is a major milestone for CEFC. We view this synergistic partnership with RPG as an extension of our turnaround story, where we have successfully restructured CEFC's business by moving from the previous loss-making beauty product business to a new strategic focus in the more profitable oil trading business.\"\n\nRPG and its subsidiaries are involved in port management businesses in China, including port loading and unloading and cargo warehousing for bulk cargo such as coal, cement and steel. Rizhao Port Oil Terminal owns and operates the existing infrastructure of Rizhao port, and also runs the existing 750,000 cubic metre crude oil and fuel oil storage facilities in the port area.\n\nCEFC, formerly known as Sun East Group Ltd, suffered consecutive years of financial losses in the beauty product business. It entered the petrochemical and fuel oil trading business in late 2012, and the relative success of the new business led to its exit from the exchange's watchlist on Aug 7 last year.\n\nThe group expects to be able to leverage its inventory of oil and petrochemical products stored at the new facilities upon its completion in two years, which will increase its trade volume and margins. Surplus capacity may also be leased to third parties to generate more revenue and cross-selling opportunities for the group, it said.\n\n\"Our strategy is to take on a multi-pronged approach to expand vertically and horizontally along the petroleum and petrochemical distribution value chain,\" said Mr Zang. \"We are excited about this greenfield investment in Rizhao port, which is China's ninth largest and Shandong's second biggest port with rapid growth potential. This collaboration with state-owned RPG is expected to raise the group's profile as well as pave the way for future collaboration opportunities.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But in recent years, science has added more to the list - the ability to detect movement and position, balance, time, and pain.\n\nThe Singapore Art Museum's (SAM) latest exhibition, Sensorium 360: Contemporary Art and the Sensed World, explores these important components of the human body that keep us alive and allow us to experience life.\n\n\"Our senses are so integral to the way we navigate the world,\" says SAM's curator Joyce Toh. \"We want people to have a renewed awareness and appreciation for our senses, and how they work with the mind. They're so vital for us to get through the world and yet we often take them for granted because we simply expect our senses to work,\" she adds.\n\nSensorium 360 will showcase the works of 11 artists from Singapore and Asia - including Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, and China. Their works are contemporary art installations that explore nine different senses by interacting with the audience in creative ways.\n\nExplains SAM director Susie Lingham: \"You think you can close your eyes and then you don't see art, but this time around you close your eyes and you'll see nothing, but the art is still there. And it will invade your senses without you intending it because you will be hearing it and smelling it.\"\n\nFor example, Filipino artist Christina Poblador's work titled May Puno sa Dibdib ng Kamatayan (There is a tree in the heart of death) is an installation where she has paired a range of different smells to a selection of musical compositions that are significant to her. You're supposed to put on a pair of headphones and listen to the music, while sniffing an arrangement of 10 test tubes that correspond to each piece of music. Through this, the artist wants to examine the relationship between the sense of smell and hearing, especially since both are effective at evoking nostalgia.\n\nWhile you are encouraged to interact with the artworks in this exhibition, it's not all without a purpose, says Ms Toh. \"This will be an engaging show, but it's not just entertainment. There are a lot of rich concepts and so much about the human condition can be learned by looking at the mind and body in tandem and how they work in mysterious ways.\"\n\nSome of the works discuss more serious issues like CCTV surveillance or seeing the world through the eyes of visually-impaired people. But ultimately, it all starts with just experiencing the works, says Ms Toh. \"Sometimes, talking about the work diminishes some of the enjoyment because it makes it too explained,\" she says. \"Yes, there's a lot of thinking behind it, but first and foremost is the experience of the artwork itself.\"\n\nrachloi@sph.com.sg\n\n@RachelLoiBT\n\n'Sensorium 360: Contemporary Art and the Sensed World' runs at the Singapore Art Museum till Oct 22. Opening hours are from 10am to 7pm daily, and 10am to 9pm on Fridays. Admission is free for Singaporeans and PRs. Log on to\n\nwww.singaporeartmuseum.sg\n\nor call 6589 9580 for more information\n\nCAGE\n\nChinese artist Li Hui's installation uses laser beams to create two virtual cages in a dark room. Although the lasers do not actually hurt, they tend to affect people psychologically and make them feel trapped. On a philosophical level, the work also acts as a metaphor for the imaginary boundaries people create for themselves, which might not actually affect them in reality.\n\nUNSEEN\n\nLocal artist Alecia Neo's installation began in 2012 during a residency in Taiwan. There, she worked with six visually-impaired people and gave each of them a 35 mm disposable camera to take photos of the world from their perspective. From those photos, she created tactile prints, or \"braille drawings\" that line the perimeter of a dimly-lit room so audiences can \"see\" these photographs by touching them.\n\nTHE OVERVIEW\n\nINSTALLATION\n\nThis work by local artist Eugene Soh invites members of the public to put on a pair of goggles to navigate a maze painted on the floor. The goggles replace the participant's normal view, so they see themselves going through the maze from a different perspective such as a \"god-view\" from above, or with lateral vision like that of a chameleon, among others.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The steady loan growth was broad-based across territories and industries.\n\nUOB chief executive Wee Ee Cheong said that the global economy is more stable than six months ago and the region is benefiting from that.\n\n\"Six months ago, markets were concerned about QE (quantitative easing) tapering and the impact on Asia,\" said Mr Wee at the results briefing.\n\nUOB saw that as positive as it meant that the US economy was recovering, he said.\n\nLoans growth for the full year will be a high single digit, he said.\n\nThe bank's net interest margin remained unchanged at 1.71 per cent in Q2 2014.\n\nThe net interest margin is expected to be maintained for the rest of the year, as the group has to balance funding costs, said Lee Wai Fai, UOB chief financial officer.\n\nBanks have been competing fiercely for deposits in Singapore which have not kept pace with loans growth.\n\nDeposits in June rebounded after a contraction in April and May, official data show. The loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) stayed flat at 110.6 per cent in June, but was still a record high since 1998.\n\nDeposits were up by 0.8 per cent month-on-month (m-o-m) in June, mainly led by ACU or US dollar deposits, up 2.6 per cent m-o-m. Domestic banking units deposits, or SGD deposits contracted for the third consecutive month, and were down 0.3 per cent m-o-m.\n\nUOB has also been diversifying its funding sources. The bank increased its US commercial paper programme limit from US$10 billion to US$15 billion and raised more than S$12 billion of short-term funds as at end-June.\n\nUOB said that customer deposits at end June was S$216 billion, up 8.5 per cent from a year ago across a broad base of current and savings accounts and fixed deposits. Its LDR at end June was 87.8 per cent, up from 85.3 per cent a year ago.\n\nNon-interest income grew 21.1 per cent from Q2 2013 to S$760 million with increased gains from investment securities. This was offset by a fall in fee and commission income, down 6 per cent at S$410 million due to lower wealth management, fund management and loan-related fees.\n\nCosts increased 8.4 per cent over Q2 2013 to S$787 million on higher staff and revenue-related expenses. Expense-to-income ratio improved, recording 41.7 per cent in Q2 2014 compared to 44.2 per cent in Q2 2013.\n\nUOB shares closed trading yesterday at S$24.16, up 11 Singapore cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The cloud agrees to do so, only after the yaksa describes in detail all the astonishing sights and wonders the cloud would see on its way to his wife's home.\n\nThis 1,500-year-old story has, in the hands of Haresh Sharma and Alvin Tan, transformed into a contemporary play about the experiences of seven graduating students of the Intercultural Theatre Institute (ITI).\n\nMost of them are foreigners who've spent three years away from home to pursue the ITI theatre course, so the ancient tale resonates with them.\n\nCalled Cloud Messenger, the play has three concurrent storylines: the first involves the students talking about their experiences of being in Singapore and how they stay in touch with their loved ones; the second has the students playing foreign workers (a maid, a security guard and a cleaner) who also experience estrangement coming here for work; and the third is a fable about young clouds who have to come to the cloud academy to train to become cloud messengers - just like the one in Kalidasa's story.\n\nSharma and Tan were invited by the school to work with the graduating class, and the play was created after numerous workshops with them.\n\nTan raves: \"The students are so disciplined and committed. We'd tell them what we're trying to achieve in a scene, and they'd discuss among themselves and come up with ideas. It's a joy working with them.\"\n\n'Cloud Messenger' is playing at Drama Centre Black Box on Aug 8 and 9. Tickets at S$25 from\n\nwww.ticketmash.sg/cloudm\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However, the atmosphere quickly changes from cheerful to tense as the characters become intoxicated, and prejudices are laid bare and inner personalities are revealed, causing the audience to ponder over the notion of friendship - both the character's and the audience's own. When the group decides to play a game that requires each character to make a confession, the result will shock and intrigue the audience.\n\nThe play also discusses social issues like monogamy and status. It stars actors like Chris Bucko, Nelson Clemente and Tim Garner and Robert Jenkin.\n\n'The Boys in the Band' runs from Aug 7 to Aug 16 at the Alliance Francaise Theatre.

Linc Energy arrived at the A$133 million figure in royalty revenue based on this.\n\nThe mine, which by some estimates will provide fuel to generate electricity for up to 100 million people in India, is expected to contribute about A$3 billion to the Queensland economy each year at full capacity, and generate thousands of jobs.\n\nAll coal will be transported through a privately-owned railway that Adani will build with South Korean firm Posco E&C, which connects to the existing Aurizon rail infrastructure near Moranbah, and shipped through coal terminal facilities at the Port of Abbot Point and/or the Port of Hay Point.\n\n\"From a personal viewpoint, it was Linc Energy that explored the area and discovered this great coal resource, so every Linc Energy shareholder should be proud of the fact that this significant project exists because of the entrepreneurial endeavours of our team and our company,\" said Mr Bond. \"We look forward to watching the Carmichael project develop into Australia's largest coal mining operation.\"\n\nThe counter closed 0.5 cent lower at S$1.25 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It also marked the launch of pioneer sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, which created a dedicated space for creatives to put their ideas out and await interested supporters.\n\nNow, the industry has evolved to spawn a new generation of crowdfunding platforms - those which provide customised services catered to niche industries.\n\nIn Singapore, Haystakt was the first one out of the stable in 2012. Unlike most crowdfunding platforms which cater to project ideas from any genre, Haystakt zeroes in on the creative market. Designers of furniture, for example, can make a campaign page with a target number of pre-orders for a chair, and only start production once they hit their target.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The total employment growth a year ago was 33,700.\n\nCitigroup economist Kit Wei Zheng noted that the second-quarter drop in job creation contrasted with the average increase of 16.5 per cent quarter-on- quarter in the past two years.\n\nThis, he added, was a possible reflection of the cyclical slowdown in economic activity seen in the first half of 2014.\n\nFemke Hellemons, country manager of human resource firm Adecco Singapore, felt that the slower job creation was due to the impact of sunset industries and sunset jobs, where certain jobs were made redundant or replaced by technology.\n\nIn all, the MOM report found that Singapore's total employment stood at 3.54 million in June, 3.6 per cent higher than a year ago.\n\nServices continued to generate the majority of employment gains with 20,100 jobs, although this was lower than the 24,900 figure in the first quarter.\n\nThe news wasn't as good for the manufacturing sector, however. The industry shed some 2,600 workers - a sharp contrast from the growth of 2,300 workers a year ago - and also marks the largest quarterly fall in manufacturing jobs since the third quarter of 2009.\n\nGrowth in the construction sector, meanwhile, slowed to 4,300, almost half the 8,500 jobs created in June last year.\n\n\"With the exception of manufacturing, the low unemployment rate suggests that it may have been supply constraints that led to lower job creation,\" said Citigroup's Mr Kit.\n\nAs far as layoffs are concerned, MOM found that redundancies declined across all the major sectors.\n\nAbout 2,300 workers were released in the second quarter, down from the 3,110 who were let go in the previous three months and the 3,080 laid off in June 2013.\n\nServices formed the bulk of the retrenchments with 1,500 people affected, followed by manufacturing (500) and construction (300).\n\nKelvin Wong, chief technical strategist at City Index Asia, reckons that job creation in the coming months in Singapore should show signs of improvement.\n\nThis is provided the key economic data of Singapore's major trading partners - such as the United States employment payrolls and China manufacturing data - continue to stabilise and surprise on the upside.\n\nCommenting on the tight labour market, Ms Hellemons of Adecco said that companies were facing challenges with the ongoing labour crunch here.\n\nWhile the lower number of layoffs could point towards a continued optimistic economic outlook, she said that it could also mean that companies were being more cautious in releasing employees due to the limited talent pool in some areas.\n\nWhile the tight labour market was proving to be a strain on companies in terms of hiring, one silver lining is that younger workers could benefit as a result.\n\n\"It does provide interesting opportunities for young job seekers who can observe trends in the job market and specifically skill and train for a career in areas where there may not be an abundance of available talent,\" said Ms Hellemons.\n\n\"We have seen this take place in the hospitality sector, which has created an additional number of job openings over the past few years,\" she added.\n\nThe full MOM report is available at\n\nhttp://stats.mom.gov.sg\n\n. The ministry said it would release more comprehensive labour market data for the second quarter on Sept 15.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But, for the more experienced, looking at smaller less liquid markets like Spain where yields are higher but so are the risks, it is a natural progression,\" David Green-Morgan, JLL's global capital markets research director said.\n\nChinese real estate outbound investment totalled US$5.4 billion during the period, with commercial investment contributing US$4 billion.\n\nJLL noted that developers and insurance companies remained the most active investors, and while the interests mainly focused in core office and mixed use development projects in global gateway cities, there was an increasing interest for hotel and hospitality products in popular Chinese tourist destinations.\n\nThe introduction of the Golden Visa in many southern European counties has also raised the profile of these locations among Chinese mainland investors, it added.\n\nSeparately, on retail investments, the United States was the country most favoured by Chinese home buyers, according to Juwai.com, the largest real estate portal that targets Chinese buyers looking abroad, based on inquiry data from first-half 2014.\n\nAustralia ranked second and Canada third, even though it cancelled the Immigrant Investor Programme in February.

At Lippo Plaza, the average passing office rent held steady at RMB9.11 psm per day as at end-June.\n\nAsked if it has plans to inject any more properties into its portfolio, CEO Tan Shu Lin said: \"We do want to grow; we are always looking out for opportunities.\"\n\nUnits of the Reit rose half a cent to reach 83 Singapore cents yesterday, the highest ever since its January listing, although the run-up in share price mostly occurred a week ago - coincidentally after a prominent substantial shareholder Tong Jinquan did an 'internal restructuring' with the shares he owned in the Reit through different entities.\n\nMs Tan said she cannot explain the correlation between the price increase and Mr Tong's transaction. It could be herd instinct - \"maybe people see certain people transact and follow\" - but it could also be due to analysts' recent bullish forecasts for Singapore's office property sector.\n\nMr Tong currently owns about 16 per cent of the Reit, which Ms Tan says is \"not worrying\" as the Reit sponsor still holds a majority 49 per cent stake. Mr Tong, a property developer and reportedly China's 35th richest individual, has amassed significant stakes in at least nine Singapore Reits recently, which has unnerved some Reit managers.\n\nLooking forward, the Reit expects the limited new office supply in Singapore's CBD over the next two years to boost rental rates for Grade A offices, which will ultimately benefit the Reit's lease renewals at OUE Bayfront.\n\nIt noted that the Chinese government's mini-stimulus measures appear to be filtering through to the real economy. \"The authorities are expected to continue to maintain a supportive fiscal and monetary policy stance until economic growth stabilises,\" it said.\n\nEven so, vacancies in Puxi (west of the Huangpu river where Lippo Plaza is situated) rose in Q2, although rents managed to increase modestly nevertheless.\n\nBut new supply coming onstream in Puxi and competition in decentralised areas for the rest of the year is likely to pose competition, and rental growth is expected to be subdued, it said.\n\nOUE Commercial Reit closed trading yesterday at 83 Singapore cents, up half a cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

If all goes as planned, the asset-purchase programme will end by October. Even so, the Fed has said that interest rates will be kept low for some time after QE3 ends.\n\nIn recent months, investors have taken the Fed completely at its word. Money managers such as Pacific Investment Management Co (Pimco) argue that the world is in a \"new neutral\" mode, where interest rates are low along with global growth. Asset prices around the world are at record highs, while bond yields are at record lows. In the short term, it looks like one can do no wrong by investing in most financial assets, including stocks, bonds and property.\n\nBut it is worth remembering that markets do not listen to the Fed all the time, nor is the Fed spot-on with its views. For example, in June 2008, then Fed chairman Ben Bernanke notably said that \"the risk that the economy has entered a substantial downturn appears to have diminished over the past month or so\". The S&P 500 by then had already fallen 200 points from its peak of around 1,550 a year before, and would crash in the months ahead. The US economy would slide into recession.\n\nToday, as the Fed winds down its asset-purchase programme, Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen is maintaining that, on the whole, the US market is not frothy; nor does she think that inflation - which has inched up close to the Fed's 2 per cent long-term target - is a problem.\n\nThere is some room for scepticism. Goldman Sachs last week downgraded its global stock allocation to \"neutral\", pointing out that geopolitical risks have risen while global growth seems to have stalled. What is of some comfort to bubble watchers is that overheated segments of the market have started correcting. Junk bonds, for example, have been sold off in the past two weeks after they hit a high a month ago. Pricey Hong Kong and Singapore property markets have also shown declines.\n\nIf inflation trends higher, and more than 200,000 US jobs continue to be created each month, markets could very well resume their focus on the imminent rise in interest rates to cool things, regardless of what the Fed says. Bonds will be the most obvious asset class that will take a hit, raising borrowing costs.\n\nAfter being at near-zero for five-and-a-half years, interest rates' eventual rise will make assets around the world costlier to finance. There was a taste of a post-QE world last June-August, when both stocks and bonds fell, along with emerging market currencies. Markets might have jumped the gun then.

So far, his conclusion is: not yet.\n\nEven as China stocks look cheap and are rallying, the investment director at insurer Prudential's asset management arm, Eastspring Investments, is staying cautious.\n\n\"You probably want a bigger capitulation. We had a grinding de-rating,\" he said.\n\nHe is instead bullish on Japan because of fundamental reasons when comparing the two countries. Profitability and free cash flows are rising at Japanese firms while falling at Chinese ones. Japanese firms are also paying off their debts while Chinese firms are taking more debt, he said.\n\n\"We recently went back to overweight on Japanese equities (again, after 2012-13) ... this is not just about Abenomics. There's been genuine improvement in Japanese profitability, which is converging to the rest of the world,\" he said.\n\nReturn on equity (ROE) ratios in Japan have gone up to 10 to 11 per cent from sub-10 levels, even as Japanese balance sheets are already in shape since 2005, he said.\n\nWith China, operating cashflows are flat at non-financial companies while free cash flows have been negative - one of the few markets in the world to exhibit that statistic. Interest coverage, or how much earnings can take care of interest payments, has been falling.\n\n\"They are overinvesting, leverage is rising,\" he said, adding that he prefers to take positions on China through Australian mining firms, which have stronger balance sheets.\n\nInvestors have been widely negative on China due to rampant credit growth in the Chinese economy amid a large shadow banking sector that is difficult to get a grasp on.\n\nBut stocks there have been on the rise, bolstered by a recovering manufacturing sector and what seems like a stabilisation of gross domestic product growth at around 7.5 per cent.\n\nSome investors, notably Templeton Emerging Markets Group executive chairman Mark Mobius, are saying it is not too late to buy into the rally. Mr Mobius calls for a further upside of 20 per cent. But others like Mr Ferres, analysts at Bank of America and Deutsche Bank point out that high debt and low free cash flow are negatives for stocks.\n\nYesterday, a gauge of China stocks listed in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, had a price-to-earnings ratio of 8.1 times and a price-to- book ratio of 1.2 times.\n\nThe only market that is cheaper is Russia's Micex Index, trading at 5.8 times earnings. Investors have been bearish on the country due to instability in the Ukraine region as well as the potential damage Western sanctions could inflict.\n\nBut here, Mr Ferres sees opportunity. He has allocated one per cent of the World Value Equity Fund he oversees to Russia and another one per cent to emerging Europe, which is also exposed to the Russian economy.\n\nIn the short term, things could get worse, he admitted. But he said the bearishness is overdone, pointing out that Russia's corporates have low debt, Russia itself has a large foreign reserves buffer, and stocks are trading at four to five times earnings and at or slightly below book value.\n\n\"Russia is the cheapest market in the world by a long way ... it's so cheap, it's so unloved,\" he said.\n\nSberbank, Russia's largest bank, is trading below book value and is profitable with an ROE of 16 to 20 per cent, he noted.\n\nAnother opportunity lies in gold mining companies, he said. \"Gold miners are trading at their biggest discount to global equities since the 1980s ... hopefully the gold price stabilises at this level. Gold is a nice diversifier for some positions; often gold has rallied when we had problems with oil in the Middle East,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The region's carriers are seeing yields come under pressure as a result of overcapacity in the market.\n\nMr Lee said that the group will work at pushing up load factor and then improve yield.\n\nIn July, Tigerair Mandala's key shareholders - which include Tiger - officially shut down the loss-making Indonesia-based budget carrier after the double whammy of overcapacity in the market and the sharp depreciation of the Indonesian rupiah made it impossible for the carrier to pull itself out of the red.\n\nTiger also recently sold its 40 per cent stake in Tigerair Philippines to Cebu Pacific after it was limited to a small market share in the Philippines. Before that, it divested a 60 per cent stake in Tigerair Australia to Virgin Australia.\n\nMeanwhile, industry veteran JY Pillay retired yesterday as Tiger's chairman, with United Overseas Bank chairman Hsieh Fu Hua taking over. In his opening comments at yesterday's AGM, Mr Pillay recounted Tiger's \"chequered\" history over the last decade, which included \"a possibly premature initial public offering\" and subsequently the rapid exit of its private equity investors. Mr Pillay also highlighted that a hefty order for 50 aircraft were placed in 2007 for expansion into new territories.\n\n\"The group had no choice other than to proceed with the expansion into Indonesia and the Philippines,\" he said.\n\nNow, Tiger has reversed its earlier expansion efforts in the region, leaving it with Tigerair Singapore, a 40 per cent stake in Tigerair Australia and a 10 per cent investment in a new carrier based in Taiwan.\n\n\"Notwithstanding the burdens we inherited, we acknowledge we could have taken some action earlier. We express our regrets to the shareholders that we were not able to do better under very trying conditions,\" Mr Pillay added.\n\nAs part of its turnaround efforts, Tiger is seeking to deepen strategic alliances with carriers such as Scoot, restructure its network, implement cost-saving initiatives and garner more revenue from overseas. To address the overcapacity issue, it is grounding eight planes this financial year and aims to place out a further four planes which came from now-defunct Tigerair Mandala.\n\nNoting that Singapore Airlines competes with Tiger on certain routes, one shareholder stressed during the Q&A session that investors would like to see stronger support from SIA, describing Tiger as the stepdaughter who has never been allowed into the main house. SIA holds a 40 per cent stake in Tiger.\n\nAlso stepping down from the board yesterday was Mr Koay, while former Jetstar Asia chief Chong Phit Lian joined the board as an independent director.\n\nShares in Tiger closed at 42.5 Singapore cents yesterday, down one cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For the quarter under review, earnings per share were three Singapore cents, down from 10.4 Singapore cents.\n\nExpenditure eased 3.1 per cent to S$3.64 billion with fuel costs - a major expense for airlines - coming down from S$1.44 billion in 1QFY13/14 to S$1.37 billion in 1QFY14/15. The group recorded a hedging gain of S$20.4 million in the quarter, versus a hedging loss previously.\n\nHowever, operating profit slumped nearly 52 per cent to S$39.5 million.\n\nShare of losses of associated companies widened from S$2.9 million in 1Q13/14 to S$18.9 million in 1Q14/15 due largely to Tiger Airways, in which SIA holds a 40 per cent stake.\n\nThe group said that share of profits from joint venture companies dropped from S$27 million to S$16.3 million due to weaker performance from engine repair and overhaul centres.\n\nIn the first quarter, the parent airline company registered an operating profit of S$45 million - as yield fell by 1.8 per cent - down from S$89 million previously, while SIA Engineering reported an operating profit of S$21 million, versus S$28 million. Regional wing SilkAir's operating profit plummeted from S$14 million to S$2 million, while SIA Cargo's operating loss narrowed from S$40 million previously to S$18 million in the quarter under review as it continues to work at better matching capacity with demand.\n\nIn 1QFY14/15, passenger yield for the parent airline slipped from 11.1 cents/passenger km (pkm) to 10.9 cents/pkm, while yield for SilkAir declined from 14.1 cents/pkm to 13.3 cents/pkm. But cargo yield rose from 32.7 cents/load tonne kilometre (LTK) to 33 cents/LTK.\n\nExceptional items worked out to S$0.3 million as a S$7.3 million additional gain from the earlier sale of a stake in Virgin Atlantic was offset by SIA Cargo's additional impairment loss of S$7 million on two surplus freighters that were grounded and marked for sale.\n\n\"The outlook for the air transportation industry has become more challenging with continuing uncertain global economic climate, geo-political concerns in the region and elevated fuel prices,\" SIA said in a release to the Singapore Exchange after the market closed.\n\nEarlier this month, Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 crashed in eastern Ukraine, a tragic incident which comes just four months after the disappearance of MH370. Meanwhile, travel demand has dampened for Thailand, where the military seized power in May.\n\nSIA added that load factors in the current quarter are expected to remain stable year-on-year, although capacity injection and competitive pricing from rivals will continue to put downward pressure on yields.\n\nThe carrier has been facing stiff competition from regional and Middle Eastern full-service airlines as well as budget carriers.\n\nMeanwhile, overcapacity in the market will continue to dog the cargo business, which is simultaneously struggling with a slow recovery in airfreight demand. \"SIA Cargo is targeting specific product segments and traffic lanes to boost performance,\" SIA said.\n\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter stood at S$5.63 billion.\n\nThe counter closed at $10.60 yesterday, unchanged.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is despite lower contribution from its overseas properties which led revenue to fall 1.4 per cent to S$48.4 million.\n\nNet property income rose marginally by 0.2 per cent to S$39.2 million, however, as operating expenses for its Singapore, Japan and China properties fell.\n\nThe Reit's Singapore portfolio - which includes stakes in Orchard Road heavyweights Wisma Atria and Ngee Ann City - contributed two-thirds of its total revenue in Q2.\n\nBut while revenue and net property income from its Singapore operations rose 3.6 per cent and 5.5 per cent, respectively, on positive rental reversions, it was offset by weaker overseas contributions.\n\nNotably, revenue from China fell 35.7 per cent on lower sales amid a contraction of the high-end and luxury retail segment. This followed the Chinese government's austerity drive, as well as increased competition from new and upcoming retail developments in the city of Chengdu where its property Renhe Spring Zongbei is located.\n\nIts Japan segment also saw a loss of income contribution from its divestment of Holon L, a Tokyo retail property, in March this year.\n\nMalaysia, its second largest contributing country, also reported lower earnings due to the depreciation of the ringgit against the Singapore dollar (SGD), and higher property taxes in the quarter.\n\nAustralia, its third-largest contributor, reported lower income as the Australian dollar depreciated against the SGD as well.\n\nThe Reit manager said that tight labour conditions continue to limit the expansion plans of retailers in Singapore, but it sees healthy demand for prime Orchard Road retail space from new-to-market retailers.\n\nBut its outlook for its Chengdu business remains bleak as the high-end luxury retail landscape in China continues to be impacted by weakened consumer sentiments and austerity measures.\n\nFor its first six months, the Reit's gross revenue has fallen 5 per cent to S$97.6 million, while net property income has dipped 3.4 per cent to S$78.3 million.\n\nUnitholders can expect to receive their latest payout on Aug 28.\n\nUnits of the Reit closed unchanged at 84 Singapore cents yesterday before its results were announced.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Which explains why, since the box-office success of the X-Men in 2000, Marvel has become a fixture in Hollywood's summer blockbuster season with one superhero after another brought to life on the big screens this time every year.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy is the 10th instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. First introduced to comic fans in print 35 years ago before being rebooted in 2008, the superhero ensemble never came anywhere near to becoming the household names X-Men or Fantastic Four are; but they have always been a fan favourite and a best-kept secret for comic book nerds.\n\nAll that could well change with this rollicking movie adaptation, co-written and directed by James Gunn (Scooby Doo). It's made with the sort of giddy fanboy love not seen since Joss Whedon turned The Avengers into the granddaddy of all Marvel superhero films.\n\nThe result is an out-of-this-world rock and roll space adventure with a retro-cool soundtrack of pop hits from the seventies to boot.\n\nBest of all, Guardians of the Galaxy doesn't take itself too seriously - like Chris Nolan's Batman movie franchise is often guilty of - but instead just focuses on delivering two hours of solid entertainment.\n\nGunn, a low-budget specialist who made his screenwriting debut with Tromeo and Juliet (1996), a horror send-up of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, brings his energetic B-movie vibe to this outrageous intergalactic roller-coaster of a film. He gives Guardians ofthe Galaxy its own distinctive irreverent humour, setting it apart from the other Marvel superhero flicks.\n\nPlot-wise, there isn't much to write home about; Gunn and his newbie co-writer Nicole Perlman don't stray far from the typical good-versus-bad epic sci-fi showdown storyline.\n\nA highly-likeable Chris Pratt (TV's Parks and Recreation) plays Peter Quill, the Walkman-toting space hunter with great taste in music, who unwittingly becomes a wanted man after he steals an orb that has the power to destroy the universe.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it's something Ronan (Lee Pace), the biggest bad-a** in outer space also wants. So to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands, Quill (or Star-Lord, as he prefers to be known by his hero alter ego) must ally with a fellow bunch of interplanetary misfits to save the galaxy.\n\nThis bunch includes a high-kicking female alien, Gamora (Zoe Saldana, looking hot even in full green body make-up); an angry beefcake called Drax the Destroyer (wrestler David Bautista); a wise-cracking raccoon that's handy with a machine gun, Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper, who merrily hams it up); and his walking tree sidekick, Groot (Vin Diesel, who has a grand total of one line in the whole film).\n\nEven though the special effects can be blindingly overwhelming at times, Guardians of the Galaxy still proves to be a trippy ride - animals and plants talk; while the colours of the various aliens are macaron-pretty - and its all-round zany spirit should ensure it is guided to box-office success, even if nobody has heard of it (yet).\n\nRating:\n\nB+\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We should just do away with derivatives, companies should stop dressing up liabilities as equity instruments, insurers should stop mixing insurance with investment products, and the list goes on.\n\n\"If we do all that, accounting will become very simple. But complexity is a reality we have to live with.\"\n\nMr Hoogervorst did add, however, that there are ways in which the complexity can be made more manageable. \"We share the widely held view that, often, disclosures do not contain useful information. Many aspects of the disclosure problem have to do with behavioural factors - for example, many preparers will err on the side of caution and throw just about everything into disclosures, just to be sure; they do not want to risk being asked by the regulator to restate their financials.\n\n\"After all, no CFO (chief financial officer) has ever been sacked for excessive disclosures; restatements, on the other hand, can be rather career-limiting.\"\n\nTo change this mindset, he said that the IASB has come up with ways to cut out unnecessary disclosures. For example, it made changes recently to International Accounting Standard (IAS) 1, on the Preparation of Financial Statements, to clarify that non-material disclosures ought to be excluded, even in the notes to the accounts.\n\nMr Tham, however, raised the point that it is perhaps about time that accountants call a spade a spade - and state upfront that a transaction is complex, that perhaps the current financial reporting standards do not cover such a transaction or suggest a range of ways in which to account for it, and that the accountant needs to use his own judgment to figure out how to report it.\n\n\"It doesn't help us, as an accounting profession, to say that 'because the world is complex, bear with me, guys - everything I say is complex' . . . We totally abdicate our responsibility.\n\n\"The challenge I'm throwing to you, Hans, is this: if we look at this company and say this company is generating profits in a complex manner that defies all known ways of the entire accounting profession to describe, to account and to disclose, when do we - as professionals - actually say that to the readers of the financial statements? Because that's when we truly begin to deal with complexity.\"\n\nMr Hoogervorst said, in response, that he strongly believed that, that no matter how complex a company or transaction is, there is a way to present one's financial statements in a clear manner. \"I have seen financial reports from complex multinational companies that read like a book, where they have managed to summarise their disclosures and present a clear story.\"\n\nAs for the IASB and the standards they issue, he said: \"We try not to unnecessarily complicate standards. We sometimes do. We can do better. And we can help companies declutter their disclosures.\"\n\nMr Hoogervorst also spoke on the IASB's attempts to achieve full convergence on accounting standards with the US's Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), saying that one single set of global accounting standards is no longer an achievable project.\n\nThe divergence came with FASB deciding to stick to US practices on several aspects of IFRS 9 on financial instruments, out just recently.\n\n\"It's a pity. Convergence would have allowed the US to make the ultimate jump to IFRS. But nobody can force it to do so; if it wants to stick with US GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles - the US financial reporting standard), that's its choice. But IFRS moves on - we have a large part of the world to take care of. That's the new reality.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Goodpack's independent directors have accordingly recommended shareholders to vote in favour of the scheme when they convene on Aug 14 to give their approval for the acquisition.\n\nAccording to the terms of the acquisition, shares in Goodpack will be transferred to IBC Capital Limited, a company held by a fund affiliated with and advised by KKR. Goodpack's shareholders will then be entitled to receive S$2.50 per share in cash - representing a 23.3 per cent premium to the counter's closing price on March 18, being the day before the company first announced a possible transaction. The consideration values the company at about S$1.4 billion.\n\nEarlier, equity analysts have similarly also called the offer price \"fair\" and \"decent\", although they felt uncertain about the unclear intentions of other large shareholders in Goodpack, including institutional funds such as Capital Group and Universities Superannuation.\n\nGoodpack's executive chairman David Lam and a holding company that he controls - collectively owning 32 per cent of the company - have already put up irrevocable undertakings to vote in the deal's favour, however.\n\nFor KKR's acquisition to succeed, a majority of shareholders present at a meeting have to vote for it, and those who do have to hold at least 75 per cent of the value of Goodpack shares held by all the shareholders present at the meeting. Earlier this month, Goodpack also succeeded in having the holders of all but one of its bonds agree to waiving certain conditions that would be non-compliant as a result of the acquisition by KKR.\n\nIts counter ended three Singapore cents higher yesterday at S$2.41.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Faster wage growth would help to further spur sentiment and provide the wherewithal for bigger gains in consumer spending.\n\n\"Stronger job growth helped boost consumers' assessment of current conditions, while brighter short-term outlooks for the economy and jobs, and to a lesser extent personal income, drove the gain in expectations,\" Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said in a statement. The figures \"suggest the recent strengthening in growth is likely to continue into the second half of this year.\"\n\nThe Conference Board's gauge of present conditions rose to 88.3 from 86.3 in June. The barometer of consumer expectations for the next six months increased to 92.7, the highest since February 2011, from 86.4 a month earlier.\n\nThe share of Americans who said jobs were currently plentiful advanced to 15.9 per cent in July, the highest since May 2008, from 14.6 per cent. Consumers said they expected greater employment opportunities in the six months ahead.\n\nPayrolls surged 288,000 in June after a 224,000 gain the prior month that was bigger than previously estimated, figures from the Labour Department showed this month. The unemployment rate dropped to an almost six-year low of 6.1 per cent.\n\nMore employment opportunities will probably keep Federal Reserve policy makers on the path to reduce monetary stimulus as they begin a two-day meeting today.\n\nThe share of respondents in the Conference Board's survey that said they expected their incomes to rise in the next half year rose to 17.3 per cent in July from 16.7 per cent a month earlier.\n\nAnother report showed homeownership rate in the US fell to a 19-year low as rising prices and tight credit kept many first-time buyers out of the property market. The share of Americans who own their homes was 64.7 per cent in the second quarter, down from 64.8 percent in the previous three months, the Census Bureau said in a report yesterday.\n\nThe rate matched the level in the second quarter of 1995. Housing has become less affordable and more difficult to finance for entry-level buyers, even as mortgage rates have held close to record lows.\n\nFirst-time purchasers accounted for 28 per cent of all sales of previously owned homes in June, compared with about 40 per cent historically, according to the National Association of Realtors. \"The first-time buyers are the ones who would be the net addition to homeownership,\" Millan Mulraine, deputy head of U.S. research and strategy at TD Securities USA LLC in New York, said in an interview. \"Those people, who are generally college grads or the ones who just got married, are not owning homes like they used to.

For the six months to end-June, net profit for the hotel group decreased 15.8 per cent y-o-y to S$7.76 million from S$9.22 million.\n\nRevenue for the period fell 5.5 per cent to S$28.29 million, as the group saw its average occupancy rate fall to 85.9 per cent from 91.4 per cent a year earlier, and average revenue per available room decrease to S$91.90 from S$93.60. Cumulative earnings per share were 0.74 cent, a decrease from 0.88 cent a year ago.\n\nGlobal said that this year continues to be challenging as the visitor arrivals' decline is coupled with the new supply of rooms in the market. However, it hopes to see better performance in the next six months with the full operation of the new hotel Parc Sovereign Hotel - Tyrwhitt, and the completion of asset enhancement works at Fragrance Hotel - Pearl.\n\nGlobal's shares ended trading unchanged at 38.5 cents on Tuesday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

JMC is the Joint Ministerial Committee established by Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nIn a recent interview, he stated that the link was targeted to be completed \"by 2018 or latest by 2020\".\n\nGiven reports that the JMC was expected to have made the decision last year, the target seems ambitious.\n\nIndeed, Mr Ismail revealed that multiple configurations have been put before the JMC. The four options - high bridge, low bridge, sunken tunnel or bored tunnel - come with 29 alignment alternatives (combining the four options), in part because Malaysia has yet to decide where to locate its station.\n\nIts choices are JB Sentral, Tanjung Putri or Bukit Chagar while Singapore has elected to site its station on the Thomson line, where the first phase is to open in 2019.\n\nPlans for an intercity rail also do not appear in the distant horizon even though it has been nearly a decade since Iskandar's launch.\n\nWhat has been far swifter getting off the ground are property projects as evidenced by the number of construction cranes that now juxtapose the landscape, particularly after Chinese developers including Country Garden Holdings and Guangzhou R&F Properties descended on Iskandar, inundating the domestic market with their \"carpet bombing\" strategy of building and selling in the thousands rather than taking a more phased approach.\n\nMr Ismail insists that there isn't an issue.\n\n\"Firstly, I don't think the supply of high-end units is sufficient for potential purchasers. If we take Iskandar, all the hype about development constitutes less than 5 per cent of the total 2,217 sq km, and this is mainly in Medini, Putri Harbour and Danga Bay. \"Secondly, the price is within their reach and determined by supply and demand\" here, referencing Iskandar's main catchment target of Singaporeans or residents working there.\n\nAccording to data from the National Property Information Centre (Napic), some 300,000 homes are either under construction or in the pipeline, amounting to about 42 per cent of the current 702,000 homes in the state. Even so, Napic's figures often lag the market. How many of these are high-end or costing at least RM1 million (S$390,000) is also unclear.\n\nThe lack of clear property statistics adds to concerns and IRDA was not able to offer any data either.\n\nBut Mr Ismail trusts that \"the developers have done their forecasts\". Local builders are similarly careful about criticising the deluge of units planned since the Chinese developers are experienced players. Moreover, many purchasers are now viewed as global citizens who are content to buy an apartment for use as a holiday pad.\n\nIn any event, Mr Ismail was quick to point out that IRDA's executive powers are limited. Facilitation and planning might come under it, but not enforcement, he stressed, adding that the onus is on the relevant authorities, including local councils responsible for approvals, to consider the feasibility of a proposed development.\n\n\"IRDA is only involved in catalytic projects involving real estate that have a multiplier effect, for example industrial and tourism. We can't stop others if they want to develop real estate.\n\n\"But if the authorities vested with powers act in the way they are supposed to, things should be okay.\"\n\nThe numerous property developments notwithstanding, the controversy surrounding two to three planned massive reclamation projects has added to the negative sentiment.\n\nForest City, a proposed man-made island of 2,000 hectares of reclaimed land near the Second Link involving Country Garden and state investment agency Kumpulan Prasarana Rakyat Johor as well as the state monarch recently had work halted by the federal government after Singapore lodged a complaint that its shoreline could be adversely affected.\n\nThe development was said to lack a detailed environment impact assessment despite its size and potential ramifications to the surroundings.\n\nTwo other proposed reclamation projects involving listed Benalec Holdings and members of the royal family off Tanjung Piai and off Pengerang have also set alarm bells ringing. Local media has reported that a delay in approving the EIA had prompted a rebuke from the Sultan.\n\nWould such potentially disruptive developments - not provided for in the Iskandar Comprehensive Development Plan - put a dampener on further investments which to-date total some RM146 billion? Mr Ismail side-steps. He observed that \"a lack of consultative process and engagement with stakeholders\" may have contributed to the bearish sentiments at present. If IRDA had been consulted at the planning stage, it would have advised on the suitability of such projects, he said.\n\nHe prefers to talk about the many jobs that will be created from catalyst developments such as the US$27 billion Petroleum Integrated Complex (PIC) in Pengerang, and said that in 2013, some 98,440 vacancies were created, out of which about a third were skilled or semi-skilled (mainly in electrical & engineering), and the rest, low and unskilled work. Even so, only 11,180 jobs were filled mainly in E&E, hospitality and tourism.\n\nThe first phase of the PIC, to be developed over some 15 years, is scheduled to commence operations around 2019 and according to projections, when completed, will result in some 14,000 jobs, about 4,000 of those professionals.\n\nUnder Iskandar's comprehensive development plan, the workforce is projected to touch 1.4 million by 2025, from 660,000 now.\n\nGiven the estimated 800,000 jobs to be created over the period, Mr Ismail argues that some 600,000 units are required over and above the existing housing stock. \"I can confidently say the project will bring in the right people to create demand for high-end homes.\"\n\nAs the billions get invested on the ground, it remains to be seen how much of the ideals underlined in the Comprehensive Development Plan is adhered to. But the tepid rollout of public infrastructure to match investments is likely to crimp progress, especially when more and more homes are completed.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The trade group said that spending on business travel would rise about 7 per cent this year, to roughly US$1.18 trillion - US$292.3 billion of that in the United States, up 3 per cent.\n\nBut as the industry representatives geared up over the weekend for five days of meetings, exhibitions and after-hours parties, there is a lot of sober discussion about travel safety and risk management.\n\n\"I've been at this 28 years - military, US government, different response companies - and this is the greatest concentration of threats that I've ever seen, because of the frequency and severity of these incidents, but also because companies and institutions are global now,\" said John Rose, chief operating officer of iJet, a travel risk management company.\n\nOn Sunday, executives from iJet and another travel security and emergency response company, International SOS, jointly presented a four-hour training session for a group of travel managers concerned about safety policies and health issues, for both highly experienced travellers and younger, novice travellers, \"who tend to believe they are invincible\", said Wendy Stachowiak, director of global travel partnerships for International SOS.\n\nRecent events have focused attention on growing corporate responsibilities for their travellers. \"With everything that has happened in the last eight days, people are looking at things differently,\" Mr Rose said on Sunday.\n\nHe asked the group gathered around tables in a conference room what they were hearing right now as main travel safety concerns. The first two responses, he said, were \"Malaysian airliner shot down\" and \"outbreak of Ebola\".\n\nIn the last two weeks, a concentration of events has forced travel managers to focus more intensely on legal and ethical responsibilities for managing travel risk: the Malaysian airliner shot down by a missile in Ukraine and two other deadly plane crashes elsewhere; the halting of some air routes in the Middle East because of fears about ground combat; and the temporary suspension of some flights to Israel.\n\nIn addition, the US evacuated its embassy in Libya; street protests reached a boil in Hong Kong; and, just as disturbing to security managers, an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus was spreading in West Africa.\n\n\"The thing that really keeps me awake is Ebola,\" Mr Rose said.\n\nThat has dire implications, added Myles Druckman, medical director for International SOS, including a threat posed by returning international travellers who have been exposed to the virus. \"These things were simply not on people's radar in the past,\" Mr Druckman said.\n\nSimilar themes were sounded on Monday at a panel discussion titled \"Get Me Out of Here!\" sponsored by the trade association's risk committee.\n\n\"How do you plan for these things, and how do you decide what your responsibilities in general are to your travelling population?\" said Pablo Weisz, a regional security manager for International SOS. \"What kind of travellers do you have? Experienced? A traveller on their first or second international trip? What kind of training do those individuals need?\"\n\nMany travellers baulk at keeping their companies closely apprised of their day-to-day activities and locations. But knowing where people are in a crisis is crucial, security specialists say.\n\nMr Weisz said: \"Young travellers might arrive in Beirut and announce that arrival on Facebook, but at the same time they might question why the company wants to know exactly where they are. It's a matter of getting them used to it: Your company does need to know where you are.\"\n\nIncreasingly, travel management involves legal issues, including potential criminal penalties in some countries for not maintaining adequate so-called duty of care for travelling workers.\n\n\"There's a lot of risk associated with not meeting your duty-of-care responsibilities,\" Mr Weisz said. In a lawsuit, for example, a company travel manager might be asked in court, \"what did you do to protect your traveller?\", he added.\n\nWith business travel growing around the world (China is likely to surpass the US in business travel spending by 2016, the trade group says), \"today, you have a different dynamic in managing business travel\", said Michael McCormick, executive director of Global Business Travel Association.\n\n\"In the old days, it was Chicago to New York, New York to Los Angeles,\" he said. \"Now, in a sense, every company is global, and they're sending their travellers all over the world to do business.\" - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM", "images": []}

Oil revenues from the northern oil fields could fuel Kurdistan's fight for independence.\n\nThe Iraqi government warned Kurdish officials to stop the illegal exporting through Turkey, which began in December, according to the complaint. The crude shipment, currently docked off Galveston, left Ceyhan, Turkey, on June 23, and has \"changed destinations multiple times\" while at sea, according to the filing.\n\nIf a US refinery accepts shipment of the crude, it will send a signal to the rest of the world that it is acceptable to do business with the Kurdish government, said Carl Larry, president of Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC.\n\n\"It opens the door to some kind of breakup in that region where you could have a separate Kurdistan and Iraq,\" Mr Larry said in a telephone interview. \"It's definitely going to create that separation, and more people are going to recognise that and respect it.\"\n\nThe Iraqi Oil Ministry asked US marshals to oversee lightering operations to remove crude from the tanker and store it onshore at Iraq's expense. A proposed arrest warrant filed with the complaint doesn't ask to seize the United Kalavrvta, the Marshall Islands-flagged tanker, which is too large to enter the Houston Ship Channel and offload cargo directly.\n\nA lightering contract has already been signed, according to the complaint, and the tanker has been cleared to proceed with offloading by the US Coast Guard, according to an agency spokesman.\n\n\"The United Kalavrvta has completed all the standard procedures with the Coast Guard to conduct business here,\" Andy Kendrick, a Houston-based spokesman for the agency, said in an e-mail. \"We are not imposing any additional criteria.\"\n\nPhillip Dye, a Houston attorney representing the Iraqi Oil Ministry, didn't immediately return telephone or e-mail requests for comment after regular business hours.\n\nOil producers are actively pursuing resources in coordination with the Kurdistan Regional Government, which estimates the northern territory holds 45 trillion barrels of oil reserves. The Kurdish government expanded its control over the country's resources in early June, when Kurdish Peshmerga armed forces took control of northern Iraq's key oil hub, Kirkuk, after militants routed the Baghdad government's army. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM", "images": []}

These Travel Smart Network companies will be offered three new initiatives.\n\nThe first is a Travel Smart Grant of up to S$160,000 annually for three years to co-fund the cost of initiatives which companies put in place to support the adoption of flexi-travel arrangements by their employees.\n\nThese include arrangements that give employees the flexibility to travel to work earlier or later after the morning peak period, use more sustainable modes of transport like cycling, or reduce the need to travel by working away from the office.\n\nUnder this grant, there are several claimable initiatives, such as the enhancement of transport infrastructure or systems to support flexi-travel or to support demand aggregation of transport services.\n\nThese could be the development of a bus shuttle service, or the installation of shower and bicycle parking facilities, or converting car park spaces for bikes.\n\nBreakfast discounts or vouchers for staff who travel early are also included, as are incentives to appoint so-called Travel Smart Ambassadors within the organisation to promote Travel Smart efforts among employees.\n\nThe second initiative is a Travel Smart Consultancy Voucher of up to S$30,000 to engage approved consultants to conduct employee travel pattern analysis and develop travel demand management action plans tailored to the needs of the company and its employees.\n\nLTA says these will help companies gain an insight into their employees' travel patterns and understand the motivating factors, as well as determine potential Travel Smart measures.\n\nThe final perk is cash rewards. The employees of Travel Smart Network companies who travel from 6.15-7.15am and 8.45- 9.45am will get Travel Smart rewards in the form of bonus points, which can be redeemed for cash prizes of between S$1 and S$200. In addition, there will be a monthly lucky draw of S$1,500.\n\nAccording to LTA, employers play a pivotal role in enabling shifts in the travel patterns of their employees. Since October 2012, 12 companies have participated in a pilot to implement various initiatives such as tele-commuting and allowing staff to work from home before travelling to the office after the morning peak period. In a survey of about 3,800 employees from the companies between October 2013 and January 2014, close to 12 per cent of respondents said they had shifted out of the morning peak of 8.30-9am.\n\nSome reasons cited for wanting to travel earlier include a more pleasant ride, the availability of flexi- work arrangements, and both time and cost savings.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n2\n\nDollar-selling is becoming a bubble, which may burst, HSBC says\n\n3\n\nStocks to watch: SGX, Frasers Centrepoint Trust, NTT DC Reit, BRC Asia\n\n4\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\n5\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value", "images": []}

He also predicted that other carriers would re-route their flights.\n\n\"This is a political animal but . . . the fact of the matter is MH17 changed everything, and that was very nearly in European airspace,\" Mr Clark said.\n\nAbu Dhabi's Etihad Airways said in a statement that it, like Qantas, would continue to fly over Iraq at this stage, adding that the \"nature of the current security environment in Iraq is significantly different than in the Ukraine\". - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM", "images": []}

If there is indeed a new toll, or an increase in toll charges, at the Causeway, the Singapore Government will match the new toll and increase in toll charges in due course,\" the LTA spokesman said.\n\nThe spokesman added that the Singapore government has not yet heard from the Malaysian authorities about this new toll or increase in toll charges, and has asked for official confirmation of the changes from the Malaysian government.\n\nCurrently, private cars entering Johor from Singapore pay a one-way charge of RM2.90 (S$1.13). There is no charge for cars crossing over from Johor to Singapore.\n\nReports over the weekend said that Malaysia intends to collect a two-way toll from Aug 1.\n\nCars passing through the CIQ would have to pay a total of RM16.50 for a day trip to Singapore or Johor and back. A fee of RM9.70 will be charged while entering Johor and an extra RM6.80 will be charged on the way out. Buses will have to pay RM13.30 per two-way trip while taxis will be charged RM8.20.\n\nThese changes follow Malaysia's announcement earlier this month of a new entry fee on foreign-registered vehicles entering Johor. That came shortly after Singapore said on July 1 that it would raise the Vehicle Entry Permit (VEP) and Goods Vehicle Permit (GVP) fees for foreign-registered vehicles entering Singapore.\n\nSingapore's Ministry of Transport has said that its VEP and GVP fees are not discriminatory and are there to \"equalise\" the cost of owning and using foreign-registered vehicles on Singapore's roads with that of vehicles registered here.\n\nMalaysia has not said when it will roll out the entry levy and how much it will be. LTA said yesterday that Singapore has contacted the Malaysian authorities on this matter as well, and is awaiting a reply before deciding its response.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A lack of new homes coming onto the market has been cited as an important factor.\n\nBank of England governor Mark Carney last week reiterated his view that the housing market represented the biggest domestic risk to Britain's economic recovery.\n\nHowever, there have been some signs that the market might be cooling off including a fall in measures of house prices compiled by Halifax and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. \"People believe that it's a good time to sell but not buy, particularly in London and the South East where house price expectations are generally higher and buyers appear to be less inclined to rush into buying a property as we have seen over the past 12 months,\" said Halifax Mortgages director Craig McKinlay.\n\nPositive sentiment towards selling was highest in the East and South East, where 65 per cent of respondents thought it would be a good time to sell. In Scotland, only 36 per cent felt positive.\n\nHalifax said that seven in 10 British adults predict the average UK house price will rise over the next year.

Mr Bajaj declined to comment on that figure.\n\nAlthough earnings figures are not directly comparable as banks include different businesses in their commercial banking units, HSBC's is much larger. It had profits before tax for its commercial bank in Asia Pacific of US$4.4 billion last year, according to its annual report.\n\nCiti also said it will begin commercial banking in Vietnam, adding around 18 staff to the 600 it has there.

Both sides describe talks as \"productive\".\n\nNegotiators for the International Longshore and Warehouse Union and management's Pacific Maritime Association are set to meet again on Aug 4 after discussions were paused on July 25 for unrelated contract talks in the Pacific Northwest, the union and the Association said.\n\nThe ports from San Diego to Bellingham, Washington, which contribute 12.5 per cent to the US gross domestic product, have remained open, and about 20,000 dockworkers have continued loading and unloading cargo since their contract expired on July 1.\n\nThe union and the maritime association are negotiating over work rules, salaries and healthcare.\n\n\"They see the wisdom of reaching an accord on both sides without any disruption,\" said Jock O'Connell, an international trade economist in Sacramento. \"They know this is the worst possible time to obstruct movement of goods through seaports because this is when most of the importers are bringing in merchandise for the back-to-school season and the end-of-the-year holidays.\"\n\nDiscussions that ended on July 25 \"after several days of productive contract talks\" will resume in San Francisco.\n\nThe maritime association, which represents shipping lines and terminal operators, locked out workers in 2002 after contract talks broke down. The 10-day shutdown ended when then-president George W Bush invoked the rarely used Taft-Hartley Act to reopen the ports. The cost of that interruption was US$1 billion a day, according to the maritime association.\n\nAnother stoppage that long would put 169,000 people out of work, cost US$7.1 billion in lost imports and exports and sap US$2.1 billion a day from the US economy, according to a report in June from the National Retail Federation and the National Association of Manufacturers.\n\n\"Everybody still remembers what happened in '02,\" said Jonathan Gold, vice-president of supply chain and customs policy at the retail federation in Washington. \"That's playing a pretty heavy role as importers and exporters are planning out their supply chains and trying to get their goods to markets when they need to be there.\"\n\nWhile it's a positive sign that the union and the association have issued joint statements announcing progress in the talks and pledging to keep cargo flowing, Mr Gold said, some companies have put in place contingency plans such as relying ports in Canada or shipping merchandise earlier. \"Everybody is planning for that what-if scenario.\"\n\nThe West Coast ports are responsible for almost half of all US maritime trade, including more than 70 per cent of imports from Asia. The largest of the ports is the Port of Los Angeles, where cargo volume has rebounded to almost the peak in 2006, before the recession, and could surpass that next year, based on port statistics.\n\nWest Coast ports have been squeezed by competitors in Mexico, Canada and the Gulf Coast and East Coast in the United States, and will be pressured by the opening of the expanded Panama Canal in 2015.\n\nThe West Coast ports' share of US shipping trade volume fell to 43.5 per cent in 2013 from 48.6 per cent in 2008, according to a maritime association report. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM", "images": []}

The number of transactions for contracts on China's CSI 300 Index fell on Monday to the lowest level in 10 months versus share volumes in the cash market, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The last two times the ratio fell this low, in September and February 2013, the CSI 300 sank an average 8.2 per cent over two months.\n\nChina's most sophisticated traders favour futures because the contracts make it easier to add leverage to high-conviction wagers, Hong Hao, the Hong Kong-based strategist at Bocom International Holdings Co, said in an interview.\n\nWhile the highest equity volumes since 2010 show increased confidence among individual investors in China's economic expansion, the lack of interest from futures traders is a sign the recovery is already reflected in stock prices, Mr Hong said.\n\n\"The probability for at least a correction, even if not sizable, is very high,\" Mr Hong said on Monday. \"The recovery has long been a consensus and is already in the price.\" Bocom International Holdings is a unit of Bank of Communications Co, China's fifth-biggest lender.\n\nHerding Effect\n\nMr Hong's pessimistic view puts him at odds with bulls, including Standard Chartered Plc's Erwin Sanft and Templeton Emerging Markets Group's Mark Mobius, who say that the rally will extend as low valuations lure investors and the government supports growth with stimulus. The CSI 300 surged 2.8 per cent on Monday to 2,323.9, the highest since Dec 31, extending its gain from a five-year low in March to 11 per cent.\n\nThe CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite Index were little changed at 10:20 am. Trading of CSI 300 companies rose to about 18 billion shares on Monday, the highest level since October 2010, and has climbed about 73 per cent since the gauge began rallying from its March low, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nThat compares with a 15 per cent drop in trading of CSI 300 futures during the same period, to about 991,000 contracts.\n\nWhen volumes in the futures market were this low relative to cash equities in February 2013, it came two days before the peak of a bull market in the index.\n\n\"We attribute the recent market rally as a typical herding effect,\" Lu Wenjie, a strategist at UBS AG in Shanghai, said.\n\nIndividual investors account for about 80 per cent of equity trading on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, versus about 14 per cent on US bourses, according to data compiled by the Chinese exchange and TABB Group LLC.\n\nBullish investors see the combination of government stimulus and reform lifting Chinese stock valuations from some of the lowest levels in emerging markets. Mr Mobius, whose US$12 billion Templeton Asian Growth Fund has outperformed 93 per cent of peers this year, said last week that he sees Chinese stocks rising an additional 20 per cent. Mr Sanft, the Hong Kong-based head of China and Hong Kong equity research at StanChart, predicts the rally will continue through year-end.\n\nChina cut reserve requirements for some banks, accelerated infrastructure spending and loosened property curbs as Premier Li Keqiang seeks to keep growth from falling below his 7.5 per cent target. State-owned companies such as PetroChina Co, the nation's largest energy firm, and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd, the top lender by market value, have been among the biggest contributors to the rally as the government pledged to open state-run industries to private capital.\n\nRelative Value\n\nThe CSI 300 index is valued at 8.6 times estimated earnings for the next 12 months, versus a multiple of 11.2 for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\"China is up for a re-rating, quite a significant one,\" said David Gaud, a Hong Kong-based senior portfolio manager at Edmond de Rothschild Group, which oversees about US$179 billion.\n\n\"They managed to combine both reforms and maintaining a certain momentum in the economy, which would be the perfect pair if it works.\"\n\nWhile valuations are low relative to peers, they've gotten more expensive during the past four months. The CSI 300 now trades at about a one per cent premium versus its one-year average, and is approaching the three-year mean multiple of 9.5, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nThe CSI 300's gain has lifted its 14-day relative-strength index to 80.9, the highest level since October 2010. In the Shanghai Composite, 256 of the 1,004 members had an RSI of more than 70, the most since Nov 23, 2009.\n\nThe Shanghai gauge fell 29 per cent from that level through July 5, 2010. Readings above 70 are a signal to some traders that the rally has gone too far, too fast.\n\n\"Investors should start reducing risk,\" Mr Hong wrote in a note to clientson Monday. \"There will be another entry point.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Wealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom: survey\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/058dc5f79ec81a0fafccbf7b916552f43dc1d3505dd71a49bf10e0adc0d30371?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "PHOTO: BLOOMBERG"}]}

That in turn weakens American public support for the president and doesn't inspire confidence in American leadership around the world.\n\nIt's true that President Obama isn't responsible for the eruption of international conflicts and civil wars around the world. While the end of the Cold War wrecked the relatively stable unipolar system of the Cold War, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq helped erode American hegemony and made it much more difficult for the United States to exert its influence in the Middle East and elsewhere. Moreover, against the backdrop of the changing global balance of power and the growing isolationist mood at home, much of the cautious approach that President Obama adopted in response to the crises in the Middle East and Ukraine, and in particular, his reluctance to use military force to end the civil war in Syria, as well as his willingness to use diplomacy to resolve the differences with Iran and Russia, made a lot of sense.\n\nYet President Obama has failed to articulate a clear and coherent vision of his foreign policy and to present a set of priorities he wants to advance around the world, and he sounds sometimes more like a pundit than the Leader of the Free World when he discusses America's role in the world.\n\nHence, he announces his determination to shift US geo-strategy from the Middle East to East Asia, but at the same time, continues to deploy his Secretary of State to Europe and the Middle East. And while pledging to conclude historic free trade deals with the Pacific economies and the European Union, President Obama has yet to use his political capital to advance this goal.\n\nSo instead of continuing to discuss what he doesn't plan to do in Syria or Ukraine, President Obama needs to explain what exactly he considers to be core US national interests today and to outline a strategy to protect them. Not only the American people but also America's allies abroad are waiting for that message to come from the White House.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Up to date this year, the performance of global equity markets has been patchy and seems at times inconsistent to the fundamentals. This of course can be attributed to the fact that we continue to get unexpected events that have affected sentiment or the market's misperception of economic reality.\n\nLooking back at the first half of the year, the key assumption of most market participants was that a strengthening recovery of the United States economy would be the driver for equity outperformance and a more broad-based normalisation in both the global economy and monetary policy. But due to an unexpected harsh winter in the United States, growth stalled in Q1 and only in Q2 are we experiencing a sharp rebound in growth. Even though the momentum in growth is reappearing, there was a dampening effect on investor sentiment overall. Furthermore, the unexpected flare-up in the Ukraine and the subsequent annexation by Russia of Crimea raised tensions in Europe. Geo-political uncertainties are usually bad for markets and those involving large countries do have a major impact on financial markets.\n\nWe do expect that unless the tensions de-escalate, this issue may continue to affect investor sentiment going forward.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

On July 23, an ATR-72 turbo-prop crashed on the Penghu Islands in Taiwan, leaving 48 people dead.\n\nRecovering the wreckage in Mali may prove difficult as some of the debris is covered by rainwater after storms across the country, Burkina Faso authorities said.\n\nWhile it's \"probable\" weather may have been a factor, \"it is too early to draw any conclusions,\" French President Francois Hollande said in Paris after meeting relatives of the 54 French citizens who were on the plane.\n\nThe bodies of all the victims will be brought to France for identification and delivery to families, Mr Hollande said.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/transport-logistics/sulphur-emission-enigma", "site_title": "Sulphur emission enigma", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nSulphur emission enigma\n\nShipping industry anxious about how uniform enforcement would be in North America and northern Europe\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Jul 29, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIN five months' time, we will be just a day away from the implementation of the 0.1 per cent sulphur limit for ship emissions within the Emission Control Areas (ECAs) of North America and northern Europe. There are three obvious and related questions. Is the shipping industry ready? Will the limits be rigorously enforced? And will that enforcement be uniform?\n\nThe answers are not perhaps as straight forward as it might seem. Taking the first question first, the answer has, generally speaking, got to be no. But the retort could justifiably be \"ready for what?\". That is a point I will return to later.\n\nSo, what about enforcement? Will it be rigorous? The signs are that it probably will. The Netherlands, Germany and the Nordic and Baltic countries generally take a tough line on the environment and the likelihood must be that they will apply the same zeal to the new regime.\n\nThe US and Canada will have no problems in ratcheting up their current enforcement on the limit. And, in North America, lack of uniformity is hardly likely to be an issue.\n\nIn northern Europe, things look rather different. Most countries are likely to take enforcement seriously. In Rotterdam, for example, the authorities already have in place equipment that can detect the sulphur content of emissions from passing ships.\n\nHowever, a number of large and prestigious shipping companies take a different view. The newly formed Trident Alliance describes itself as a \"coalition of shipping owners and operators who share a common interest in robust enforcement of maritime sulphur regulations and are willing to collaborate to help bring it about\". The alliance says it will also partner other stakeholder groups, that share similar interest in robust enforcement, to work towards the same objective.\n\nThe initial membership list includes: American Roll-on Roll-off Carrier (ARC), EUKOR Car Carriers Inc, H\u00f6egh Autoliners, J Lauritzen, Maersk, Rickmers-Linie, Stena, Torvald Klaveness, UECC, Unifeeder and Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics.\n\nRoger Strevens, vice-president, environment, of Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics, has been elected chairman of the group. He said: \"Robust enforcement of sulphur regulation is needed for health and the environment and, from the perspective of maintaining a level playing field, it is a business imperative. Already during its formation, the Trident Alliance has raised awareness of the current shortcomings of enforcement and related consequences, particularly in the European ECA. Now, our work starts in earnest.\"\n\nIf enforcement is to be robust, then it will need to be uniform. That is an issue in northern Europe. There are quite different views on important technical issues to be found among the countries bordering the North Sea and Baltic ECAs. This has spurred the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) to encourage the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control (PSC) to ensure that a harmonised approach to PSC inspections has been developed by Jan 1, 2015.\n\nCompliance\n\nICS has underlined the shipping industry's commitment to full compliance with the IMO sulphur ECA requirements from January 2015. However, ICS says that it is concerned that information collected by its member national shipowners' associations suggests that many governments are not yet prepared to implement the requirements in a uniform manner, in order to ensure the prevention of a potentially serious market distortion.\n\nICS secretary-general Peter Hinchliffe says: \"The shipping industry is investing billions of dollars in order to ensure compliance with this major regulatory change, and the huge costs involved could have a profound impact on the future structure of the entire shipping industry. We therefore think it is vital that governments get the details of any PSC intervention right as we enter a new world in which fuel costs for many ships will increase overnight by 50 per cent or more.\"\n\nICS has just written to the Paris MOU in order to draw attention to the global shipping industry's serious concern with respect to the sulphur ECA implementation. With the exception of the United States, all of the coastal nations that are located within the IMO sulphur ECAs (including Canada) are party to the Paris MOU.\n\nICS has raised a number of issues. It wants confirmation that - as ICS believes should be the case - the principal method of inspection will only involve looking at the bunker delivery note (BDN), with further sampling/analysis of fuel only normally taking place when examination of the BDN suggests clear grounds to suspect non-compliance, or when there is a previous history of non-compliance with International Maritime Organization (IMO) environmental regulations.\n\nThe shipowners' body also wants to know procedures are to be followed, with reference to applicable IMO Guidelines, if sampling or analysis is undertaken during PSC inspections;\n\nThen, there is the question of how the limits can be enforced against ships that transit an ECA without calling at a port state located within it.\n\nConsistency\n\nICS is also asking if there will be a consistent approach regarding discretion for minor technical violations. These violations could arise from fuel switching when a vessel enters an ECA as opposed to deliberate use of the wrong grade of fuel.\n\nCrucially, ICS is asking for the criteria to be applied during PSC inspections where ships are fitted exhaust gas cleaning systems (scrubbers) or LNG. ICS believes that there should be a harmonised approach to the acceptability of \"closed loop\" and \"open loop\" scrubber systems, and whether overboard discharges will be subject to inspection.\n\nAll these questions need to be answered by the Paris MOU. Getting all the governments involved to agree on this wide range of complex issues is a tall order. The chances must be high that shipping faces considerable uncertainty over PSC inspections enforcing the new limit. If so, that would be bad news all around.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Malaysia Airlines crash occurred after Ukraine left open air corridors that lay within the range of the missile blamed for destroying the jet.\n\nAirlines, represented by International Air Transport Association, will tell the meeting they urgently need improved access to \"neutral information based on objective criteria\", the industry source said. \"Airlines do not have CIA operatives working for them,\" said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"At the end of the day, airlines have to decide whether to fly or not based on accurate information. Yet some countries will never, ever say there is a problem with their airspace even if there really is a problem with their airspace. This does not make it easy for airlines.\"\n\nICAO currently has a limited role and cannot open or close airspace. It issued an advisory this year, warning of a jurisdictional risk posed by two sets of air traffic controllers directing traffic over the Crimea region. Enhancing ICAO's role to give it the authority to tell airlines where to fly, or to tell its members what to do with their airspace, would test rules that dates back to World War I peace agreements and are enshrined in ICAO's founding charter.\n\nIt would also require the agency to obtain sensitive information from its member states about their internal military and political affairs. Diplomats say any attempt to tamper with the sovereignty of airspace could set broader precedents that make quick results unlikely. The United States has already said it is not seeking changes to ICAO's guidelines.\n\nThe Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation, involved in yesterday's meeting, has also said it is not pushing for a central body to provide oversight or issue advisories. While ICAO is unlikely to gain broad regulatory powers, some UN agency insiders and industry experts said the agency could help keep country regulators better informed.\n\nIt already publishes a Global Risk Context Statement, which describes risks to airliners in broad terms. The document highlights the risk of shoulder-mounted missiles, for example. But it does not say where in the world these risks are most severe, information of crucial interest to airlines.\n\nOne council representative raised the possibility of expanding the Risk Context Statement to include more details about regional conflicts. \"Nonbinding advisories may be possible,\" said another source familiar with ICAO. \"Airlines want ICAO's involvement as ICAO may have better access to government sources of security intelligence, and thus could help make better information available to airlines.\"\n\nBut governments may not be eager to share sensitive military intelligence, and singling out particular regions could anger some states. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM", "images": []}

More starkly, visitor arrivals from China fell a sharp 27.4 per cent in the same period.\n\nAccording to a recent report from STB, tourist arrivals from China took a hit during the first quarter, diving 14 per cent from a year ago. The finalised numbers for the second quarter are not out yet, but anecdotal evidence from industry players is not encouraging.\n\nChina is Singapore's second biggest tourist market and Chinese tourists are the biggest spenders among all visitor groups here.\n\nSeveral factors have combined to keep Chinese tourists away, industry players said.\n\nThe main reason for the drop in Chinese tourist arrivals appears to be the aftershocks from the MH370 saga, the high-profile - and still unsolved - case involving the disappearance of the Malaysia Airlines (MAS) flight which carried mostly Chinese passengers.\n\nThe incident, and the perception of how it was handled by the Malaysian authorities, had apparently turned off many Chinese travellers to the region, according to travel industry insiders.\n\nAdding fuel to this is the long-drawn political crisis in Thailand, as well as the recent spate of airline crashes that have dented overall travel confidence.\n\nArrivals were also affected by new tourism laws implemented in China last October to curb cheap tours which have hidden extra costs for tourists that are added on later.\n\nSingapore is simply \"collateral damage\" in all of this.\n\nIt is often bundled with its neighbours, like on the Singapore-Malaysia-Thailand route, Lex Travel's general manager, Edmund Chua, noted.\n\n\"Once they don't travel to Malaysia, we become the collateral (damage),\" he added.\n\nBoth Siam Express and Timesworld Travel & Educational Tours said that sales of their inbound leisure and student tours, respectively, have dropped by about a fifth compared to the period before the disappearance of MH370 in March.\n\nTimesworld's director Cynthia Teo attributed this to parents discouraging their children from flying after the Malaysian plane went missing, with a knock-on impact on Singapore. While some travel agencies have seen improving demand from the summer holidays, this still falls short of that in previous years.\n\nSummer holidays for schools in China typically last two months from July to August. Being the longest break in the annual school calendar, it is also a popular period for travel among well-off mainland Chinese families.\n\nThe silver lining is that things could be starting to improve.\n\nCompared to the slack period from April to May, SA Tours' manager for inbound tours, Dan Tan, said Chinese bookings and enquiries for Singapore-Malaysia combined tours have picked up by a fifth since June.\n\nSentiment towards Malaysia is also improving somewhat, and sales are improving, added Mr Tan. But sales for this holiday period are still down 10 per cent from last year.\n\nSince early July, CTC Travel said it has seen 5 to 10 per cent more enquiries from Chinese tourists, partly due to the summer holidays, about customising tours to include a Malaysia leg. Vice-president for channel distribution Sylvia Tan sees this as a \"positive indication\" of a pick-up.\n\nThe steady flow of enquiries has yet to be reflected in sales figures for such customised tours, which have dropped about 5 per cent from last year.\n\nMore recent incidences such as an air crash in Taiwan and the downing of a MAS flight, MH17, over Ukraine could even dampen travel demand further, cautioned travel trade specialists.\n\nA recent report on China tourism by the Centre for Aviation showed that the number of outbound Chinese tourists grew at a slower clip of 16 per cent last year, compared to growth rates of 18 to 20 per cent from 2010 to 2012. There has also been a shift towards the North Asian markets such as Japan and South Korea.\n\nMeanwhile, STB has launched a new mini-movie to woo Chinese tourists.\n\nLex Travel, along with other industry partners, launched a S$1 million campaign last month to draw Chinese tourists. Offering various packages with minimum three-night stays here, it aims to market Singapore as a mono-destination.\n\nSince the launch, Lex Travel has garnered a \"few hundred bookings\" for campaign products, said Mr Chua. He expects the campaign to have a spillover effect on other travel agencies.\n\nAlthough it will take time, Chinese tourists may come to see Singapore as a quality destination offering a different experience in its own right, he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will allow the bank to increase provision coverage on impaired assets on its remaining UK commercial property portfolio to 60 per cent from 51 per cent, it said.\n\n\"We've progressively reduced our exposure to UK commercial property loans,\" incoming CEO Andrew Thorburn said in the statement. \"We continue to look at opportunities to optimise return on equity by accelerating the sale of non-core assets.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 8.05 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 16,973.54.\n\nThe EU measures, endorsed today by representatives of national leaders, will take effect when the legal texts are published on July 31.\n\nConstrained by the need for consensus among the 28 governments, the EU had lagged behind the US - with fewer business links to its former Cold War enemy - in upping the pressure on Mr Putin.\n\nRival interests among Europe's leading powers prevented the EU from going further today, with France resisting a retroactive embargo that would scrap the sale of two warships to Russia.\n\nUntil now, the EU had blacklisted 87 people and 20 companies and groups accused of engineering Russia's annexation of Crimea in March and the subsequent infiltration of eastern Ukraine. Yesterday, the EU extended the blacklist to cover business associates of Mr Putin. Those names will be released today.\n\nEU attitudes were hardened by the downing of a Malaysian passenger jet over eastern Ukraine on July 17 and evidence that rebels equipped with Russian anti-aircraft artillery were responsible. All 298 people aboard were killed, the bulk from the Netherlands.\n\nFor the first time, the EU sought to hobble broad swathes of Russian industry, with the goal of accelerating the flight of capital from the country. Russian economic growth will slow to 0.2 per cent in 2014 from 1.3 per cent last year, the International Monetary Fund said last week.\n\n\"Russia needs the opposite, Russia needs internationalization, globalization to make Russia a better place to do business,\" Tim Ash, chief economist at Standard Bank Group Ltd. in London, said yesterday.\n\n\"In the short term, the impact of sanctions could be to push Russia into recession.\"\n\nTaking aim at the Russian financial system, the EU prohibited state-owned banks from selling securities with more than 90 days maturity to European investors. The result will be \"sharply increased costs of issuance,\" the European Commission predicted in a background paper last week.\n\nRussian companies have drawn increasingly upon state- controlled lenders OAO Sberbank and VTB Group since the Ukraine crisis deterred outside banks. Dollar loans from international banks slumped to US$7.9 billion in the first half of 2014 from US$25 billion a year earlier.\n\nFinancial curbs \"could be very important for Russia,\" Yannick Naud, who helps manage US$190 million at Sturgeon Capital Ltd. in London, said.\n\n\"Both the banks as well as companies are relying a lot on foreign capital.\"\n\nSeeking to starve Russia's oil industry of capital for expansion and modernization, the EU restricted the export of technology for deep-sea drilling, shale oil production and Arctic exploration. Natural gas projects weren't affected. The EU also barred the export of \"dual-use\" technologies for military purposes. - Bloomberg, AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

This has borne results. From a net profit of S$7.5 million on S$61 million of revenue in 2011, the firm grew exponentially to record a net profit of S$36 million and S$405.9 million in revenue last year. In the same period, it has built up a 120,000-square-metre complex in Henderson in West Australia, where it has various facilities for surface treatment and heavy engineering and also a newly built office headquarters.\n\nIn June last year, it acquired an offshore logistics base in Darwin to act as its second node to serve resources development in north Australia, and is now establishing yet another base in Broome, also in West Australia, to undertake offshore logistics services. And while news headline after news headline laments the state of Australian mining industry - from which Civmec derives about 65 per cent of its annual revenue - as metal prices fall, the firm still sees \"a huge amount of opportunities\" in the sector.\n\nBesides the \"still substantial\" capital expenditure by mining firms, the investments in the past years have generated operating expenditure opportunities, said its CEO, Patrick Tallon. \"When you build plants you need to maintain it and keep it at maximum capacity. . . We're in a good position to do that, and have developed good relationships with our clients during the capex stage.\"\n\nWhat is changing, however, is the preference by mining firms to reduce their supplier count. \"They're looking for a one-stop shop, and they see us as a strong unit where we're heavily involved in all the disciplines,\" said Mr Tallon. In the past two years, the firm has built on its core capabilities in pre-cast, fabrication, site civil works and modular assembly to include structured mechanical and piping installation and offshore logistics.\n\n\"Now we're at that stage where holistically we can integrate them altogether and we see huge opportunities,\" Mr Tallon said. This means that Civmec can now work on larger projects across different geographics simultaneously.\n\nIts competitors, on the other hand, offer a more narrow suite of services, said Mr Tallon. Civmec has the option of doing a full project, or taking on parts of it. \"Other companies are feeling the pain because they've pigeonholed themselves into specific disciplines,\" he added.\n\nBut even with that said about the mining industry, the firm sees greater growth to come from the oil and gas sector, which now contributes up to 35 per cent of its revenue.\n\nRevenue from both sectors will even out over the next year, and eventually Mr Fitzgerald expects Civmec to derive more of its revenue from oil and gas than mining.\n\nThat is where the Singapore office and possible acquisitions in South-east Asia can give the firm a leg up.\n\nThe Singapore office would first start with 10 staff handling business development, investor relations, procurement, and back-office functions such as payroll and accounts, and could eventually reach a size of 30 people.\n\nSingapore could also be more than a commercial hub; Civmec does not rule out establishing a facility in the Republic by renting a yard in Tuas.\n\nIn the meantime, Civmec has also invested significant efforts in developing an in-house IT system called Civtrac to drive efficiencies in its processes.\n\nIn particular, Civtrac allows the firm - and its clients - to track labour and materials, which make up 85 per cent of project costs, across the lifespan of a project, enabling it to ensure \"a good delivery at the end\", said Mr Fitzgerald. \"The good thing is we've got no legacy system. There is no change. We started off with this ourselves.\"\n\nOn top of helping the firm to make changes early when a job is not moving as quickly as planned, Civtrac has become a key differentiator for the firm in giving its clients confidence.\n\nCivmec's clients can log on to the system to monitor work progress and quality.\n\n\"Basically they don't want cost blowups on their projects,\" said Mr Fitzgerald. The firm is confident that wherever it expands to, it will be able to plug in its system and hit the ground running.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The travel industry is one such example.\n\nSeniors generally prefer a leisurely pace of sightseeing, and cruise tours are popular among them as they are less strenuous with no switching of hotels, said Chan Brothers Travel's manager for marketing communications Jeremiah Wong. He added that tour consultants ensure tours and the amount of walking involved are suitable for seniors.\n\n\"There is also a camp of silver travellers or young seniors who are increasingly well travelled and discerning in their demand for interesting experiences and new modes of travel,\" said Mr Wong. Younger seniors below 60 are more open to flexi-holiday options and new travel modes like self-drive vacations, he said.\n\nFor Chan Brothers, those 50 and above account for over 40 per cent of bookings to Europe and Asia, and about 60 per cent of bookings to China.\n\n\"We are also seeing an increasingly strong co-relating trend of higher spending and frequency of purchases compared to other age groups,\" said Mr Wong, adding that seniors have more leisure time. He said that bookings by seniors increase 10 per cent yearly, with further market potential due to Singapore's fast-ageing population.\n\nInsight Vacations also sees a similar 10-15 per cent yearly increase in senior customers. The bulk of its clients are above 45. Those aged 46-50 make up 54 per cent of its customers. The tour operator has thus slowed the pace of its itineraries, ensuring minimum two-night stays in most destinations and central accommodation.\n\nSeniors are quite travel-savvy and do not like being herded around, said Insight Vacations' regional director for Asia, Sheryl Lim. When returning to Europe, they prefer to visit places off the beaten track, she said, adding that many of those aged 46-50 travel every 12-18 months.\n\nAs the company's next largest group of customers matures (the late-20s to early-40s), Ms Lim said itineraries need to be revamped with seniors in mind.\n\nAs senior drivers hit 65, they encounter problems such as higher premiums, excess or are denied coverage. Singapore's first motor insurance policy for those aged 65 and above was launched in January to address these problems.\n\nJointly created by the Automobile Association of Singapore (AA) and Liberty Insurance, the AA Senior Motor Plus considers driving experience and claim records instead of discriminating based on age, said AA president Bernard Tay.\n\nIt also includes benefits such as free car inspections. AA represents over 83,000 motorists, almost one-fifth above 65.\n\nTo meet the retirement needs of those aged 55 and above, Hong Leong Finance launched Golden 55 Plus in 2006, a fixed-deposit account that pays a maturity bonus. Monthly interest is credited to a linked savings account for seniors to use if they wish.\n\nCompared to single-premium endowment products, Golden 55 Plus has shorter tenures of 1-2 years. A bank spokesman said the product was designed to give seniors flexibility in their finances.\n\nBesides managing their finances, seniors are becoming aware of \"age-well\" products that support ageing-in-place through media and government campaigns, said Geared For Life. The provider of age-well products said that baby boomers are starting to test such gear as they encounter ageing-related issues.\n\nLee Chang Xi, co-founder of eldercare products provider The Golden Concepts, said baby boomers have more discerning tastes. They tend to prefer lifestyle products or designer mobility aids. \"We have had some customers who purchase several walking sticks with different designs to match their different outfits,\" said Ms Lee. She noted that there are more companies providing ageing-in-place products and services.\n\nAsia's first \"virtual retirement village\", Aspire55, was started by market consultancy Ageing Asia last year to support ageing-in- place for those aged 55 and above. Like physical retirement villages, it offers social, health and care services, except that members continue living in their own homes.\n\nAgeing Asia's founder and managing director Janice Chia said that instead of a physical retirement home, virtual ones like Aspire55, which offers its services out of an activity hub called a wellbeing innovation lab, would suit Singapore as most of the population have their own flats.\n\n\"Why take them out of their house and put them in another house?\" said Ms Chia. Small hubs serve more seniors and do not isolate them in one environment, she added. Aspire55 caters to over 700 people, of whom 82 per cent are baby boomers aged 55 to 67.\n\nMembers take part in health activities such as strength and brain training exercises. By monitoring health indices and comparing them to the number of doctor visits made, Ms Chia said people age better with the virtual village than on their own. Seniors exercise within a community that can encourage them, she added.\n\nAgeing has been viewed more as a social issue, but Ms Chia believes more businesses will see it as an economic opportunity. \"Ageing is going to impact us at every level. So the question is: how can we create an environment that's friendlier to our own family members essentially - and to ourselves in the future?\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The bank said yesterday that it had secured 97.5 per cent of Wing Hang at the close of its offer.\n\nBecause the percentage of acceptances of its S$6.2 billion offer crossed the 90 per cent mark, OCBC has the right to acquire all other shares that it does not control. It plans to do so, it said in a regulatory filing yesterday, and will proceed to delist Wing Hang.\n\nAt the time of the offer announcement in April, OCBC had already received acceptances of its offer that amounted to 50.7 per cent of Wing Hang. But there had been recent speculation that OCBC would have to raise its offer price of HK$125 per share, after US hedge fund Elliott Capital Advisors accumulated a 7.8 per cent Wing Hang stake.\n\nTwo weeks ago, OCBC declared that it would stick to its offer. Thereafter, the level of acceptances accelerated, with Aberdeen Asset Management, Wing Hang's third-biggest shareholder, saying last week it had agreed to sell.\n\nSamuel Tsien, CEO of OCBC, said that the bank was very pleased with the outcome, and that the process of integrating the operations and businesses of Wing Hang with OCBC will now pick up speed.\n\n\"Wing Hang Bank gives OCBC more access in the Greater China region; we can offer a wider selection of services to Wing Hang Bank's customers as well as to Chinese companies expanding into Singapore and South-east Asia, where we have a dominant presence,\" he said in a press statement.\n\nWith the Wing Hang purchase, OCBC will now control 88 branches in the Greater China region, including those at Pearl River Delta, the world's manufacturing hub.\n\nThe offer price represented 1.77 times of the book value of Wing Hang. The acquisition is expected to be accretive to OCBC's earnings per share and return on equity by 2017, the bank had said.\n\nShares of OCBC closed two cents higher from the last trading session to end at S$9.76 yesterday. The shares have gained about 2 per cent since the offer was officially announced.\n\nShares of Wing Hang shed HK$2.20 yesterday to end at HK$121.80.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They want to know when is the flight and especially the flight number,\" said Mr Takom, 37. \"The pressure from my family to stop (working on planes) is there. They ask me to think about it.\"\n\nMalaysia Airlines' once-strong reputation has been shattered by the still-unsolved disappearance of flight MH370 in March with 239 aboard, and the downing of flight MH17 in Ukraine on July 17, which killed all 298 on the plane.\n\nThe twin tragedies claimed the lives of 27 Malaysia Airlines crew.\n\n\"Obviously MH17 is a very traumatic situation where you see it happening - the plane going down,\" said Ismail Nasaruddin, president of Malaysia's national flight attendants union, referring to grainy video of MH17's fiery last moments. \"It will take quite a while to accept. We have to wait and see what are the side effects. Some have lost their very good friends.\"\n\nNo reports have yet emerged indicating any exodus by the carrier's cabin crew - who have won numerous industry quality awards over the years.\n\nBut it is with heavy hearts that many now don the carrier's distinctive blue batik-design cabin-crew uniforms.\n\nAt an interfaith prayer session held last Friday at the airline's training centre on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur, many staff arrived in uniform, some in tears.\n\nMany lingered afterwards, crying openly and hugging each other.\n\n\"We are still feeling the pain, but we have to go on,\" said a 39-year-old female flight attendant, a 17-year veteran with the carrier.\n\nMost airline staff spoke on condition of anonymity as the company generally requests them not to speak to the media.\n\n\"It's very hard. We were just coming out of the shock of MH370,\" said another flight attendant, 41.\n\nAnother colleague said the tragedies were fuelling a sense of togetherness, while Mr Takom and others were buoyed by well-wishes, hugs and even gifts of flowers and chocolates from sympathetic passengers.\n\n\"I will continue flying but deep inside when we work we think of all those who are still missing. Anything can happen to any of us,\" Mr Takom added. \"We are like family.\"\n\nZulkifli Abdul Rahman, brother-in-law of MH17 flight attendant Azrina Yakob, a mother of two, said his family was stunned by the twin disasters.\n\n\"We were shocked by the news,\" he said at his home in a residential area near the airport where many Malaysia Airlines staff live. \"We did not expect there will be another incident. It was a big surprise.\"\n\nTribute walls have gone up on- and off-line, including photo montages of crew aboard MH17.\n\n\"RIP.

Continued gains in employment and a bigger supply of available homes will be needed to help accelerate the industry's progress, while increases in home prices may encourage more Americans to put their properties up for sale.\n\n\"Housing is a significant question mark, while many other sectors of the economy seem to be performing adequately,\" Louis Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP LLC in Jersey City, New Jersey, said before the report. There are a variety of reasons behind the sluggish growth in the industry, \"ranging from credit availability to finances to just general attitudes about housing\". Stocks dropped as industrial shares sank and investors watched crises overseas before a Federal Reserve policy decision this week. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 0.3 per cent to 1,971.9 at 10.01am in New York. The S&P 500 Homebuilding Index declined one per cent.\n\nPurchases were down 4.5 per cent from the year prior, on an unadjusted basis, after a 6.9 per cent decrease in the 12 months that ended in May, the association reported.\n\nThe pending home sales index was 102.7 on a seasonally-adjusted basis. A reading of 100 corresponds with the average level of contract activity in 2001, or \"historically healthy\" home-buying traffic, according to the NAR.\n\n\"Supply shortages still exist in parts of the country, wages are flat, and tight credit conditions are deterring a higher number of potential buyers from fully taking advantage of lower interest rates,\" the group's chief economist Lawrence Yun said.\n\nEconomists consider pending sales a leading indicator because they track purchase contracts. Existing-home sales are tabulated when a contract closes, usually a month or two later.\n\nThe housing market has been slow to emerge from a lull induced last year as rising interest rates, tight lending standards and higher home prices combined to make it difficult for some buyers to enter the market. Data paint a choppy picture of residential investment, which subtracted from gross domestic product for the past two quarters in the first-back-to-back declines since 2009.\n\nAnother report showed activity in the services sector held at its highest level in 41/2 years in July, though readings for new business and employment growth weakened, a survey showed yesterday.\n\nFinancial data firm Markit said that its preliminary services Purchasing Managers Index was 61.0 this month, unchanged from last month and above expectations for a reading of 59.8.\n\nA reading above 50 signals expansion in economic activity, and last month's reading was the highest final reading since the survey began in October 2009.\n\nThe services sector continued to add employees, though at a slower pace. The employment index fell from 56.1, the fastest rate on record, to 52.8 this month. The new business sub-component also fell from last month's record level. \"While a cyclical upswing appears underway across the service sector, the latest survey provides some indication that a smoother ride is not yet fully entrenched,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. - Bloomberg, Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

Five budding artists aged 16 or 17 from the Little Arts Academy were making their first attempts at selling their paintings to the public - all in the name of raising funds for The Business Times Budding Artists Fund, a charity for underprivileged kids.\n\nAfter all, it's not enough to just create the work - one must also know how to market and sell it. And for that the young artists had Chinese ink master painter Hong Zhu An to teach them the ropes, as well as critique their techniques and inspire them to do better.\n\nThey also had the support and network of popular gallery Ode To Art, which provided the platform for the exhibition.\n\nThe five artworks, all priced at S$1,000, are now on display at the foyer of the fourth floor of Raffles City Convention Centre. Meanwhile, the skilfully-executed works of Hong hang on the opposite walls. Ode To Art is located in the same building on the first floor of Raffles City Shopping Centre.\n\nThree of the five young artists are beneficiaries of The Business Times Budding Artists Fund, which pays for their art classes at the Little Arts Academy. The fees come up to S$1,600 per student, and the academy has 64 similarly-aged students, most of whom are supported by the fund.\n\nWorking on the exhibition theme Our People, Our Home, 17-year-old Kang Joosoon dug up old black-and-white photographs of his parents when they were still living in a kampong (village) to depict a similar image.\n\nMr Kang says: \"Listening to Mr Hong Zhu An talk about the challenges and struggles artists face, I realise that art is not just a hobby - it is a lifelong passion and commitment. His words were a wake-up call to me.\"\n\nThe other four artists are Tan Chong Hui, Tan Wen Hao, Fernandez Leong and Hong Ming Jie.\n\nTo date, The Business Times Budding Artists Fund has assisted 13,000 children in their arts education. Approximately 90 per cent of the current batch of 481 students at the Little Arts Academy are supported by the fund. The remaining 10 per cent pay fees which go into the running of the art academy.\n\nThe five student artworks are currently on display at the foyer of the 4th floor of Raffles City Convention Centre. They are priced at S$1,000. All proceeds go to BT Budding Artists Fund\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Revenue was down 19 per cent to S$76.7 million.\n\nThe company said revenue was down due to three reasons. Firstly, there was the lack of a \"vessel campaign\" in its Neptune Marine Services subsidiary compared to the year before. This referred to a bundled series of higher-value, lower-margin jobs.\n\nThere were also lower sales from its oilfield engineering businesses in Singapore. Binder Group, a pipe support and pipe suspension Australian company it acquired earlier this year, also experienced a \"quiet start\".\n\n\"As Binder operates in a project-driven environment, revenue recognition depends on (when a) project kick-starts. Enquiry levels are still healthy,\" a spokeswoman told The Business Times.\n\nLooking ahead, CEO Kuah Boon Wee said the company will focus on getting orders from Bahrain, Singapore and for Binder.\n\n\"We are also conscious of the need to continue to improve the operating performance of the Neptune division,\" he said.\n\nDMG & Partners analyst Lee Yue Jer maintained his \"buy\" recommendation for the counter with a target price of S$2.16. This is derived from 12 times the company's projected 2015 fiscal year's earnings after a bonus share issue. \"Bahrain is now delivering stronger gross profits, and MTQ is taking in more orders there. We continue to see healthy organic growth from all its oil and gas businesses,\" he said.\n\nMr Lee added that MTQ's Bahrain facility is twice the size of its facility in Singapore, and the Middle East is growing its rig count at the highest pace in the world. Neptune delivered a net margin of only 3.5 per cent in the last fiscal year and there is room for improvement, he noted. Binder can also improve its performance, he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Either way, you might beat a stock picker", "publish_date": null, "content": "Heads or tails? Either way, you might beat a stock picker\n\nThis is borne out by a recent S&P Dow Jones Indices study\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Jul 29, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[NEW YORK] Imagine a world where investors in the stock market have no skill whatsoever. The investors themselves don't understand this, however, and many truly believe that they are good at what they do.\n\nBut in this thought experiment, there's no doubt about the underlying reasons for fund managers' success: When they turn in an outstanding performance, it's just a matter of dumb luck.\n\nWhat would stock fund managers' performance numbers look like in such a universe? Very much like the world we live in now, but with an important difference: Over the last five years, actively managed stock mutual funds have performed even worse than would have been predicted if the fund managers were flipping coins instead of picking stocks.\n\nThe real-world statistics to which I'm referring were contained in a recent S&P Dow Jones Indices study that I recently summarised. But, I didn't say how mutual funds would have fared if their performance had been a matter of pure chance - a random draw, as statisticians sometimes call it.\n\n\"The results were actually very close to what you'd find in a random draw - or a series of coin flips, except they were a little bit worse,\" William D Nordhaus, a Yale University economics professor, said.\n\nThe empirical data supports the inference that it's wise to use passively managed index funds for the core of most people's investment portfolios, he said, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that some investors excelled for reasons other than dumb luck. In the real world, he said, it's possible that some rare individuals may actually possess exceptional investment talent.\n\nBriefly put, the results of the S&P study, Does Past Performance Matter? The Persistence Scorecard, were bleak enough on their own. They showed that very few mutual funds were able to consistently outperform their peers, and that those that did so in one given year were likely to be poor performers five years later.\n\nIn fact, only two out of 2,862 broad domestic stock funds were able to outperform their peers consistently over five years, according to one measure: performance in the top quartile of funds over five consecutive 12-month periods ended in March 2014. That translates into just 0.07 per cent of the funds, which means that more than 99.9 per cent of funds fell short of that feat.\n\nThat's an unimpressive performance, to be sure. And if you compare it with a series of coin flips - a series of random choices - it looks even worse.\n\nFor those interested, this is how the coin-flipping comparison works: You toss the coin. Is it heads or tails? There's a 50 per cent chance of either outcome. Let's say the coin lands on heads. If you flip it again, the probability that the coin will land on heads the second time is also 50 per cent. Because there are four possible outcomes for the two flips, there's a one-in-four, or 25 per cent, chance that your coin will land on heads twice in a row.\n\nRepeat those double flips five times and you'll find the probability of a mutual fund ending up in the top quartile five times in a row through chance: 0.098 per cent. (We're flipping the coin twice for each year of mutual fund performance.) That's a bigger probability than the 0.07 per cent scored by the actual funds. This means that if mutual fund managers had just flipped coins, roughly three of them - not two - would have been expected to end up in the top quartile for five years in a row.\n\nStill, the dismal results of the real-world fund managers were very close to what Burton G Malkiel, the Princeton University finance professor, once described as \"a random walk\". \"Taken to its logical extreme, it means that a blindfolded monkey throwing darts at a newspaper's financial pages could select a portfolio that would do just as well as one carefully selected by the experts,\" he wrote in his guide to investing, A Random Walk Down Wall Street.\n\nAs a group, managers who ran the 2,862 funds examined by S&P Dow Jones Indices didn't do as well as a blindfolded monkey. The hypothetical monkey, or a serial coin flipper, beat them in several other tests, too.\n\nWhat should we make of this?\n\nPaul Samuelson, the late Nobel laureate from MIT, with whom Prof Nordhaus collaborated on the textbook Economics, wrote several influential academic papers that dealt with the issue. In Challenge to Judgment, a 1974 paper that inspired John C Bogle to create the first index fund at Vanguard, Samuelson said that deep, liquid markets like the stock market were efficient enough to make short-term investing very much like a random draw. Index funds would be a better choice for most people, he said.\n\nYet Samuelson also believed that some investors were truly talented - even if they faced steep odds in beating the market consistently.\n\n\"Paul thought that Warren Buffett was a true genius,\" Prof Nordhaus recalled. Indeed, in a 1989 paper, Samuelson pointed to Mr Buffett as an outlier, an investor who appeared to have \"flair\". Yet he said that even Mr Buffett could be expected to have difficulty keeping ahead of the competition in the future. One reason was that if anyone starts to beat the market in a noticeable way, imitators will eliminate his edge.\n\n\"The market shows some efficiency in recognizing the occasional genius,\" Samuelson wrote. And, as it's turned out, Mr Buffett's recent performance has been quite ordinary, as a study by Salil Mehta, an independent statistician, found earlier this year.\n\nMr Mehta was also among those who emailed and blogged about the S&P findings. And he said in his blog that the exercise doesn't show \"that the cause of the selected managers' success is due to luck as opposed to skill\". But it does illustrate how rare it is for funds to outperform for any reason.\n\nAs Keith Loggie, senior director of global research and design at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said: \"It's quite possible that a number of fund managers have real skill. A few funds in the study did very well, and you'd think there was some skill involved in that level of performance ... But what the study did show is that the chance of any outperformance persisting for any extended period is very low. And it's extremely unlikely that you can pick an outperformer based on past performance.\"\n\nIt wouldn't be unreasonable to draw another conclusion.

In Australia, where borrowing is surging, regulators are just watching.\n\nAustralian household debt is at a 25-year high, according to statistics bureau figures, and a government inquiry this month found housing to be a significant source of risk to the financial system. The average mortgage is at least four times household income in almost 80 per cent of the country, research by Digital Finance Analytics shows.\n\nWhile the UK, Denmark and New Zealand introduce measures including loan limits, caps on interest-only mortgages and repayment tests, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the country's banking regulator are holding their fire, saying that risky loans haven't increased significantly. The central bank also has said that the price gains so far are spurring needed construction, easing housing shortages in some areas.\n\n\"If we think there is a need for higher construction, which we do, an environment of declining prices is probably not conducive to that outcome,\" RBA governor Glenn Stevens said on July 3. \"Some pick-up in housing prices as a result of lower interest rates was to be expected.\"\n\nAustralia has the third-most overvalued housing market on a price-to-income basis, after Belgium and Canada, according to the International Monetary Fund. The average home price in the nation's eight major cities rose 16 per cent as at June 30 from a May 2012 trough, the RP Data-Rismark Home Value Index showed.\n\nIn Sydney, the most populous city, where price growth has been strongest, values soared 15 per cent over the past 12 months. That compares with a 5.4 per cent increase in New York City in April from a year earlier and a 26 per cent jump in London prices in the June quarter from a year ago.\n\n\"There's definitely room for caps on lending,\" said Martin North, Sydney-based principal at researcher Digital Finance Analytics. \"Global house price indices are all showing that Australia is close to the top, and the RBA has been too myopic in adjusting to what's been going on in the housing market.\"\n\nAustralian regulators are hesitant to impose nation-wide rules as only some markets have seen strong price growth, said Kieran Davies, chief economist at Barclays Plc in Sydney.\n\nHome values in cities including Adelaide, Hobart and Canberra rose less than 3 per cent over the year to June 30, and house prices in areas outside the major cities gained less than 4 per cent in the 12 months to May, according to RP Data.\n\nThe central bank has reduced its benchmark interest rate to a record-low 2.5 per cent to aid a recovery in non-mining industries, including residential construction, as the nation's resources boom slows.\n\nThe interest rate cuts and subsequent home price gains have helped building approvals climb 14 per cent in May from a year earlier, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\n\nMr Davies said: \"The RBA's probably got at the back of its mind that we're only in the early stages of the adjustment in the mining sector. Mining investment still has a long way to fall, and also the job losses to flow from that. So to some extent, the house price growth is a necessary evil.\"\n\nThe central bank in its quarterly monetary policy update called declining resources investment a \"significant headwind\", for the economy.\n\nAs prices climb, the value of new mortgages also rose 16 per cent in May from a year ago, and overall housing credit increased 6 per cent in the quarter ended March 31 from 12 months earlier, statistics bureau data show. The average new home loan grew 6.7 per cent to A$433,960 (S$507,000) in June from a year ago, according to broker Australian Finance Group, which processes about A$4 billion in home loans every month.\n\nThe increase in new mortgages, while significant, doesn't appear \"imprudent\", Mr Stevens said in Hobart. With total credit growth only slightly above the increase in incomes, \"it's hard to mount the soap box to complain about that pace\", he said.\n\nSpurring the rise in loans are the lowest mortgage rates in almost five years, after the RBA cut the cash rate by 2.25 percentage points since late 2011. The average rate on variable mortgages, which about 85 per cent of Australian borrowers are on, is 5.95 per cent, the lowest since September 2009.\n\nFixed rates are also on their way down. Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank and Westpac Banking Corp last week cut their five-year fixed rates to 4.99 per cent, a record low for CBA, the least in 20 years for NAB, and a five-year low for Westpac. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group reduced its five-year fixed rate by 30 basis points to 5.49 per cent.\n\nMr Stevens this month urged investors in Sydney to be cautious, after loans to buy rental properties in the city's home state, New South Wales, surged 30 per cent to a record A$5.2 billion in May from a year ago, doubling from February 2013, according to statistics bureau data. He also warned that loans to investors covering more than 80 per cent of a property's value have been climbing.\n\nAustralians owed almost 1.8 times their 2013 pretax disposable incomes, higher than Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK and the US, the statistics bureau said in a report last month. Household debt was equivalent to A$79,000 per person at the end of 2013, and has risen at almost double the pace of assets over the past 25 years, it said.\n\nSince 1997, when Australia held its last major financial system inquiry, household debt has almost doubled as a proportion of income, with more than 90 per cent of that due to housing, the government inquiry found. Mortgages account for two-thirds of banks' loan books, from 47 per cent in 1997, it said.\n\nThe Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority, which oversees banks, in May issued draft guidelines urging lenders to conduct mortgage book stress tests, ensure brokers' compensation doesn't encourage risky lending and ascertain borrowers can repay loans, especially when rates rise. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Property\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/a813aee6860938d5d5f53643be5f13b5dc76b78adc006b90e2b2c5cea414a4e7?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Home truth: Australian household debt is at a 25-year high, according to statistics bureau figures, and a government inquiry this month found housing to be a significant source of risk to the financial system. -\u00a0PHOTO: BLOOMBERG"}]}

Experts say the silver industry - businesses catering to the needs and wants of seniors - has not developed here, despite optimism that it will pick up like in Japan and South Korea. Talk of such an industry emerged as early as 2006, along with Singapore's ageing population.\n\nPerhaps the most telling sign of the lack of activity in the silver market is the defunct Silver Industry Committee (SIC) previously headed by SPRING Singapore chairman Philip Yeo. Set up in 2006 to fund innovative ideas and promote awareness of the ageing population's business potential, SIC stopped operating in 2010 when Mr Yeo stepped down.\n\nFor the silver industry to develop, senior counsel and Wong Partnership partner Wong Meng Meng, then SIC's deputy chairman, said structural development has to be handled differently from the \"retail element\".\n\nStructural development is the physical and systemic development of \"big-ticket\" items like transport, housing and healthcare. \"It cannot be left to the private sector - partly because they lack the resources, and partly because some degree of central planning or lead is necessary,\" said Mr Wong.\n\nThe Housing and Development Board's studio apartments for those aged 55 and above launched in 1998 and equipped with elder-friendly features is one example. Both structural and retail development have to integrate - there must be suppliers of things like alarm systems in such flats, said Mr Wong. \"Clearly the retail side must come in to help that structural side.\"\n\nJanice Chia, founder and managing director of market consultancy Ageing Asia, said there will be a heavy tax burden if the industry's development is left entirely to the government; bringing in the private sector will create a sustainable and innovative market.\n\nEven without much structural progress, this year's Pioneer Generation Package launch has pushed the elderly into the limelight, leading to some businesses marketing products with the \"Pioneer Generation\" tag.\n\nTim Ho Wan gave pioneer citizens - those aged 65 and above in 2014 - a 20 per cent discount in May while Hong Leong Finance had a 65-day fixed-deposit promotion in April with higher rates for \"the country's Pioneer Generation\". Science Centre Singapore currently offers free admission to pioneers until year-end.\n\nAre businesses beginning to see opportunities in this segment? Not quite, as seniors here are still perceived as financially strapped, experts said.\n\nGeared towards handouts, the Pioneer Generation Package gives the impression that seniors are less well-off, said Gerard Ee, former chairman of the Council for Third Age. Mr Ee is also president of the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants.\n\nKim Walker, chief executive officer of Silver Group, a business consultancy in the 50-plus market, agreed. Many companies respond to the elderly in line with government initiatives, which have focused largely on the needy. \"They look at it as the glass half-empty instead of half-full,\" he said.\n\nThe tendency in Singapore is for companies to see this market as frail, incapacitated and needy. \"But they should be going to East Coast Park to look at the 50- and 60-somethings on their roller blades and expensive bikes, zooming up and down - that's where the money is to be made,\" said Mr Walker.\n\nThe silver market is heterogenous. \"You can't think of seniors in one cohort,\" said Mr Ee. Discounts and promotions to help the late-60s and older are welcome, but the mid-60s and younger - the baby boomers who are often healthier, wealthier and better educated - will have different tastes and aspirations, he said.\n\nData from the Department of Statistics last year shows that those aged 55-64 made up 13.1 per cent of the population. Those aged 65 and above made up 10.5 per cent, and are expected to double in number by 2030. Comparatively, those 65 and above make up a quarter of Japan's population, and 12 per cent of South Korea's population.\n\nAgeing Asia's Asia-Pacific Silver Economy Business Opportunities Report 2013 projected that household savings of the over-60s will hit US$974 billion in Japan, US$148 billion in South Korea, and US$37 billion in Singapore by 2017\n\nWhile the elderly segment offers much economic potential, experts are not optimistic that a silver industry will develop here soon, as most businesses have not caught on. Besides featuring successful seniors in the media, government support is also key.\n\nThe success of Japan's silver industry is partly due to its long-term care insurance programme, a social insurance system which has encouraged private sector participation by deregulation and subsidies to service providers.\n\nIn Singapore, incentives could be given to companies that engage in preventive health, suggested Ms Chia of Ageing Asia. This could be through tax rebates or a healthy ageing fund for businesses that can prove their products or services help people age better. Ms Chia added that the amount of support can be measured against delivered health outcomes.\n\nIf companies can deliver preventive care with tangible benefits, the population will age with fewer health needs, and rely less on government resources, she said. Besides, preventive care supports dignified ageing; in Ms Chia's words, \"there is no joy in wearing adult diapers\".\n\nThe development of standards in elderly nutrition, eldercare and liveability in homes and community by the Silver Industry Standards Committee (SISC) could also drive growth in these areas.\n\nThe silver industry standards address the needs of the elderly. \"When the industry develops products and services that meet the standards, they are meeting elderly needs,\" said Robert Chew, SISC's chairman.\n\nFor that to happen, businesses must first choose to adopt the standards. Some may think it unnecessary and see it as additional overheads, said Mr Chew. Getting to an inflection point where the standards gain mass adoption requires raising awareness and education, he added.\n\nIn standards development, SISC has involved industry partners such as MKPL Architects and St Luke's Hospital who can be early adopters and help in standards promotion, said Mr Chew. The first set of standards on nutrition is almost complete and expected to be released this year.\n\nMr Wong of Wong Partnership said a holistic approach - one that will involve seniors themselves - is needed. Less well-off seniors holding menial jobs could be trained as independent household cleaners as most flats today lack facilities for live-in maids.\n\nInstead of giving them handouts, make them active participants, create jobs for them and let them have dignity in their jobs, said Mr Wong. \"If they don't have a role to play, it won't work.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Gerard Tan\n\nPublished Sun, Jul 27, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nHARDLY a week passes without a media report on a data security breach somewhere in the world. Singapore is not spared.\n\nIn June, the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) made public the fact that 1,560 SingPass accounts (used for online government transactions) may have been compromised. Subsequently, it reported that three of those accounts were used to make six fraudulent work pass applications.\n\nNot too long before that, there were media reports of the theft of bank statements of 647 wealthy clients of Standard Chartered Bank, the defacement of the Istana website, and the hacking of the Prime Minister's Office website.\n\nPwC's 2014 Global Economic Crime Survey revealed that, globally, 22 per cent of economic crimes committed (15 per cent for Singapore) relate to cybercrime.\n\nThese incidents and statistics should raise concern in boardrooms.\n\nBoard's role\n\nIndeed, it is the role of boards to worry about the state of the information technology (IT) risks in their companies.\n\nThe Code of Corporate Governance requires the board to comment on \"the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal controls, including financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls, and risk management systems, in the company's annual report\". (Guideline 11.3)\n\nRecently, as part of the judging process for the 2014 Best Annual Report Award, I reviewed 50 of the annual reports of Singapore-listed companies. I found 14 of them (28 per cent) did not express a specific opinion on their IT risks and mitigation; they only opined on the adequacy of financial, operational and compliance risks in general. While it can be argued that IT risks are a subset of operational risks, nevertheless the great exposure and impact of IT risks in most companies today mean that it merits a separate focus and disclosure.\n\nBoards should fulfil their role in respect of IT risks by bolstering their own capability in this area and proactively ensuring that appropriate IT controls and practices are installed.\n\n'Digital directors'\n\nA review of most listed boards would show that they have a good mix of finance, legal and business backgrounds. However, it is rare to find board members with IT security expertise.\n\nThere has recently been a call for including \"digital directors\" on boards. These are directors mostly with working experience in high-tech companies. The focus of these digital directors are often and, importantly, focused on the strategic application of technology to the business of the company.\n\nHowever, from a risk management standpoint, there is a need for directors who understand and have a focus on cyber security and other technology risks. Such individuals could come from the IT audit or compliance units of large commercial companies and professional firms.\n\nRegardless of the presence of directors with a strong background in IT risks and security, all board members should be equipped to understand and deal with IT risks. They should attend regular training on the latest IT developments and related security challenges in a fast-moving world. Such training would help them to better understand company IT policies and practices, and place them in a more comfortable position to opine on the adequacy and effectiveness of IT controls.\n\nKey agenda point\n\nThe state and review of IT controls and security should be a key and regular component of the agendas for the Risk Management Committee, Audit Committee and, indeed, the whole board.\n\nDirectors should ensure that there is a well-documented set of Corporate IT Security Policies, Standards and Processes in place. Some security experts argue that infiltration and security breaches are inevitable, and therefore the best practice is to provide for all contingencies.\n\nGood IT controls can be found at five key levels:\n\nThe key is in effective execution. Therefore, ensuring that there are technically qualified IT security personnel to implement and maintain the policies and standards is critical. The nature and costs of IT have resulted in some companies outsourcing this important capability. The risks and management of outsourcing and the selection and qualifications of the specific outsourced vendor should be key considerations for the board when it oversees the execution and monitoring of IT controls.\n\nThe above approaches should go some way in providing board members greater comfort in opining on the adequacy of IT controls in their annual reports.\n\nFor more articles, go to\n\nbtd.sg/BMatters\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It says that the solutions are smarter, better customised and differentiated.\n\nExplaining the thinking behind these new solutions, Samsung's Andy Sim noted that the proliferation of new communications technologies was transforming the way customers interact with businesses.\n\nTaking into account the ongoing need for collaboration, communication and information consumption all in real time, Samsung provides businesses the ability to deliver differentiated experiences by integrating new formats, channels and solutions, Mr Sim, who is GM for Enterprise Business at Samsung Electronics Singapore, said. \"We have set out to pioneer the new business experience. Our goal is to help more brands unlock the benefits of digital signage and make the transition from static signs to dynamic digital messaging,\" Mr Sim added.\n\nSamsung has a wide variety of displays that meet the various needs of customers, from high-end displays with state-of-the art technologies and features, to entry-level ones with simpler design and essential functionality. \"As a total display solution provider, we also offer management software to better cater to the B2B display market that has transcended from being a simple hardware purchase to a total display solution market,\" Mr Sim added.\n\nHe noted that GEMS World Academy (Singapore) became the first international school in the country to fully integrate the Samsung MagicIWB (Interactive White Board) solutions in all their classrooms. The solution removes the need of using single-brand devices, enables teachers to integrate a wide range of student devices, and makes classroom collaboration easy and fun, Mr Sim said.\n\nDavid Edwards, the school's founding education principal added: \"The high level of interaction enabled by Samsung MagicIWB fits well with our style of teaching, which focuses on engaging students through various learning platforms. It allows a seamless learning experience as students and teachers move from working on their devices to effectively displaying content on the e-boards.\"\n\nExplaining how the system works, Mr Sim said that the Samsung MagicIWB solution is a software package consisting of three components that transform how information is presented in the classroom. They are:\n\nLast week Samsung also introduced the Samsung Smart Signage Platform (SSSP), an integrated platform for digital signage that eliminates the need for external media players. Mr Sim said the second generation SSSP streamlines the deployment process, saving time and money for businesses. It also offers improved power and additional functionality, allowing more capability and system integration than its predecessor.

These and 20 other items are going under the hammer at the \"Celebrities Give Back to Singapore\" auction organised by Marina Bay Sands (MBS), as part of its \"Sands for Singapore\" Festival.\n\nThe festival is the integrated resort's annual corporate social responsibility programme, which takes place from Aug 1-3. Auction proceeds will go to two local charities. One is The Business Times Budding Artists Fund, which helps underprivileged children aged five to 19 develop their talents in music, dance, theatre and the visual arts; the other is The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund, which gives a monthly stipend to students from low-income homes to help them with school-related expenses.\n\nThe auction, which opened on June 14 and will close next Friday, is being managed by Auction Cause, a cause-marketing and auction-management agency. Each of the 22 auction items has a minimum bid price; all but two of them have garnered at least one eligible bid.\n\nThe bid price for the pink Beckham boots, donated by the former England national team captain and Manchester United player during his visit to Singapore last month, was US$3,010 at press time. The Adidas boots bear the names of the 39-year-old's four children - sons Brooklyn, Romeo and Cruz and daughter Harper.\n\nHis wife Victoria, has donated two personal items - a pair of acetate sunglasses (current price US$410) and an A-line mini dress, which has yet to receive a bid. The starting price for the dress is US$500.\n\nAmong other items are a set of boxing gloves signed by Pacquiao and American Brandon Rios, the man Pacquiao defeated at a major fight in Macau last November. There are nine bids so far and the current price is US$800.\n\nThere are also two caps signed by the main cast and director of this year's The Amazing Spider-Man 2 movie (US$500), and a Manchester United jersey signed by the club's former defender Rio Ferdinand (US$200).\n\nMBS chief executive and president George Tanasijevich said: \"The online auction is doing well and gaining momentum as we ramp up to the festival. In the next week, we hope the public as well as guests at the BT Dream Ball will bid generously to help the BT Budding Artists Fund and ST School Pocket Money Fund to help fulfil the potential of the next generation.\"\n\nThree auction items will be up for open bidding at the BT Dream Ball next Friday, a dinner event that will feature performances by international ballroom dancing champions. The items are the David Beckham boots, Victoria Beckham's hexagonal bag and a Waku Ghin dinner experience along with a signed Tetsuya Wakuda cookbook.\n\nAll in, MBS hopes the funds raised from the celebrity auction and other events will surpass the S$3.6 million raised from its inaugural festival last year. The money will also benefit various designated charities, such as the Singapore Association for the Deaf, Art Outreach Singapore and the Association for Persons with Special Needs.\n\nThose interested in the auction may visit\n\nauctioncause.com/sandsforsingapore\n\n.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Steve Matthews and Jeanna Smialek\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jul 27, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nNICKOLE Gambrill is still paying the price for graduating college at the wrong time. She and other students who earned diplomas in the aftermath of the deepest US recession since the 1930s are experiencing an earnings hangover that could last a lifetime, even as the labour market heals.\n\nMs Gambrill accepted the first paralegal job she could get after finishing classes at Towson University in Maryland in December 2010, when the unemployment rate was 9.4 per cent.\n\n\"I've been here for three years, but I still consider myself entry-level,\" said the 27-year-old from Baltimore, who makes about US$44,000 annually. \"Your raises and income are based off of your original salary. If it were a better economy, I would have started off at a higher salary.\"\n\nStudents entering the job market in 2010 and 2011 took a 19 per cent pay cut from what they could have expected without a recession, according to economists at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut - about double the penalty in prior downturns.\n\nMany of the estimated 3.37 million graduates earning baccalaureate degrees in those two years accepted positions they were overqualified for out of desperation.\n\nThose entering the workforce in the shadow of the recession were 2.2 per cent of an approximately 154 million-member labour force competing for fewer jobs and now may have eroded skills and sparse resumes.\n\nLasting disadvantages\n\nAs the labour market improves, new graduates may outshine them. \"If you come out now, it really is a much better world, you'll have much better success,\" said Anthony Carnevale, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce in Washington, who said those who got diplomas closer to the recession will experience lasting disadvantages.\n\n\"The employer looks at the one who just graduated and the one that's five steps back, and they think the new one is better.\"\n\nRecent college graduates \"were and continue to be hit hard\", during and after the recession, two researchers for the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco wrote in a study dated July 21. They experienced low wage growth across almost all occupations compared with other full-time workers.\n\nWhile the pattern is consistent with the period after the 2001 slump, \"earnings growth following the most recent recession has been held down longer than in the past, which reflects the depth and severity of the recession\", they said.\n\nThat reality is haunting a segment of millennials, the 82 million people born between 1981 and about 2000.\n\nFull-time 25- to 34-year-old workers saw income erode to a median of US$38,000 in 2012 from US$38,760 in 2007, based on National Center for Education Statistics data. Salaries for bachelor's degree-or-higher grads fell to US$49,950 from US$52,990 in 2007.\n\nMany of these recession grads are stuck - either unemployed, working part-time or in jobs that don't require the education they have - and lack skills or opportunities to switch to higher-earning positions or bargain for more pay.\n\nJoblessness for 25- to 34-year-olds is down from 10.6 per cent in October 2009. Yet at 6.5 per cent in June, it's still higher than total unemployment, which fell to a six-year low of 6.1 per cent, and the age group's 4.9 per cent level when the 18-month recession started in December 2007.\n\nPay penalties from entering a difficult labour market are long-lasting, research from prior contractions shows. Earnings shortfalls have persisted for 15 years, University of Maryland at College Park researcher Shu Lin Wee reported in a paper last December. That's because early years are critical to lifetime income growth, with half of gains between 18 and 46 occurring by age 30 as workers switch jobs and climb corporate career ladders.\n\nThe effects of graduating during a stockmarket shock for Stanford Business School graduates have lasted about 20 years, Paul Oyer, an economist at the California university, reported in a 2008 paper. For the 2007-2009 recession, \"the hit will be significant on average\", he said.\n\n\"The evidence indicates long-term scarring, not just short-term effects that go away as soon as the recession ends,\" said Jesse Rothstein, a former Labor Department chief economist now at the University of California at Berkeley.\n\nBen Henderson has experienced the cost firsthand. After graduating from Winthrop University in Rock Hill, South Carolina, with a bachelor's degree in business in May 2009, he searched for months, only to land work as a substitute teacher paying US$9.53 an hour with no benefits near Tampa, Florida. Five years later, after moving from one part-time job to another while also pursuing coaching positions, Mr Henderson, 27, earns US$11.81 an hour as an assistant testing coordinator for an area high school.\n\nHis checkered work history is a barrier from better-paying work. \"The running joke is they won't hire you if you don't have experience, and you can't get experience if they won't hire you,\" he said. \"Obviously, this is not the plan you made.\"\n\nMs Gambrill, though she has found steady work, has reached a similar conclusion: \"People want you to have a certain amount of education, a certain amount of experience, but you really aren't paid what you're worth.\" What's more, \"once you have experience in a certain industry, it's really hard to change your career\".\n\nTough economics has caused young people to delay big purchases. Just 36.2 per cent of households under age 35 owned a home in the first quarter, down from 41.3 per cent in Q1 2008, Census data shows.\n\nSkills depreciation\n\nGraduates who start on the wrong foot have fewer \"training and promotion opportunities, resulting in a lasting disadvantage\", said Joseph Altonji, who co-wrote the Yale paper. Those who are unemployed or take jobs that don't match their education can suffer skills depreciation, he added.\n\nIn 2012, about 44 per cent of recent grads worked in roles that don't usually require a bachelor's degree, up 10 percentage points from 2001, Federal Reserve Bank of New York researchers reported in January. They warned that such underemployment may cause \"permanent negative effects on wages\".\n\nSome graduates fare especially badly. Over 60% of liberal arts and communications majors were unemployed or underemployed in 2009-2011; by contrast, 75% of engineering, education and healthcare students held jobs matching their skills. Just 33 per cent of leisure and hospitality graduates found work requiring their degree in that period - the least of any group in the New York Fed report.\n\nCompounding the situation is the level of student debt. College loans \"combined with underemployment and high unemployment among today's graduates is a fairly toxic combination\", she said.\n\nDana Katz, 27, is watching peers from Pennsylvania State University's School of Hospitality Management in State College pay the price for graduating with the Class of 2009. \"I have a lot of friends, countless kids whom I graduated with, who should have been put into a better place out of school because they were really promising, but there was nothing available,\" said Ms Katz, who works at Kimpton Hotels in Washington as an assistant director of finance. \"Kids got put into a bad place to start, and it's been reflected in their career path.\"\n\nJob-market healing is under way, so the Class of 2014 may fare better than their predecessors. Today's graduates \"are entering into a stronger labour market, full stop\", said Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.\n\nOpportunities look brighter for Abigail Estevez, 22, and her classmates. She graduated from Penn State in December 2013 and landed a spot in the management- training program at the Waldorf Astoria in New York, turning down other offers. Many of her friends are in similar jobs.\n\n\"Right now, the market is fairly strong,\" she said. \"I definitely think I'm in a good place.\" Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/0d38c42b39276395aeccfd35f442b0449089f3dab7eb8f1f12f3a256869a2b1d?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "STUCK Paralegal Nickole Gambrill says 'I've been here for three years, but I still consider myself entry-level'. - PHOTO: BLOOMBERG"}]}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/s4990-question", "site_title": "The S$49.90 question", "publish_date": null, "content": "The S$49.90 question\n\nJaime Ee debates the merits of an all-you-can-eat teppanyaki buffet at Shima versus a fine-dining set lunch\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jul 27, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nRESTAURANT REVAMP\n\nShima\n\n22 Scotts Road, Goodwood Park Hotel\n\nTel: 6734 6281\n\nOpen daily for lunch and dinner: 12pm to 3pm;\n\n6pm to 10.30pm\n\nSO I had lunch the other day with my alter ego: a penny-pinching, bulk-buying, conveyor belt sushi-guzzling consumer activist who once campaigned against selling doughnut holes separately from the doughnuts they came from. \"It's just morally wrong,\" says alter ego. \"You can't have two bites of the cherry - it's almost as bad as double-dipping.\"\n\nWe were at Shima - which in its heyday in the 80s shaped a whole generation's view of Japanese restaurants as smoky counter-top cooking joints with bandana-clad chefs tossing ladles in the air and shovelling cooked meats and vegetables onto your plate ala minute. Going home smelling like grease and soya sauce was a proud sign of your ability to pay for such a meal - not poor ventilation.\n\nFast forward a couple of generations and Shima is still amongst us, albeit in a totally different playing field. We have real Japanese chefs these days, and teppanyaki has long been pushed aside in favour of more fashionable - and smoke-free - sushi and omakase. In a case of sticking to what you know, Shima closed for two months and re-opened recently with new furniture and owners, but with the same all-you-can-eat teppanyaki buffet, plus an ala carte menu thrown in.\n\nStepping into the new-old Shima is a bit like turning off the switch to the bright afternoon sunlight outside. The interiors are cramped and broody-dark, lit mainly by spotlights and glistening steel teppanyaki counters. If you don't want to sit around the two counters (which are quickly filled up) opt for the more comfortable booths and try not to find fault with its plasticky upholstery and the black-tiled floors.\n\nThere is a Chinese restaurant feel about the place - maybe it's the dim sum lunch efficiency of the waitresses in business-like attire who don't pander to your rose-tinted stereotype of genteel Japanese hospitality. They know what you're here for - the S$49.90 buffet (S$59.90 on weekends) so they'd rather just cut to the chase.\n\nThe S$49.90 buffet lunch is the reason that my alter ego is here. To debate which is the better meal - this, or a similarly-priced set lunch at a fine dining restaurant. However, the alter ego displays a clear bias by demolishing the first round of salmon sashimi and maki, which is instantly replaced by a plate of thick-crusted, mushy prawn and shisamo tempura.\n\n\"A good meal is subjective,\" the alter ego manages to say between mouthfuls. \"Price is real. Would you pay S$49.90 for this or a couple of grams of white truffle on your pasta? Ooh, garlic fried rice!\"\n\n\"That's not the point,\" I argue. \"You can get a three-course set lunch for this money at any restaurant. Less, in fact. You can get a good meal with better quality ingredients, cooked with more flair, for S$35. This rice is clumpy and sloppily fried.\"\n\n\"Sure, but I can't get a refill of anything,\" says alter ego. \"You sure you don't want another serving of this salmon poached in a sweet shoyu broth? It's nice and moist.\"\n\n\"No. You can't order it now anyway. You have to go through the full set first. You've still got saut\u00e9ed prawns, steak, chicken, oysters and fried bean sprouts to eat still. Are you storing fat for the winter months?\"\n\n\"If you're so picky, order something from the ala carte menu,\" challenges alter ego. \"Look, four kinds of sashimi for $45 - pallid tuna, so-so shrimp, waterlogged octopus and decent white fish. Is that worth the money? Or would you rather have steak that's done passably, ordinary prawns and chicken, odd-tasting fried oysters and the screaming baby at the counter as a free extra?\"\n\n\"You sure I can't buy you a nice S$45 set lunch at Les Amis? It's just across the street. They use real chandeliers, not spotlights.\"\n\n\"No, I like it here. I want to get my money's worth. You're just a snob.\"\n\n\"Your brain can't tell the difference because all the blood's gone to your stomach.\"\n\nMoral of the story? Don't take your alter ego to lunch. And the next time you're deciding between a buffet or a fine dining set lunch, ask yourself: which one will you really enjoy?\n\nRating: 5.5\n\njaime@sph.com.sg\n\n@JaimeEeBT\n\nWHAT OUR RATINGS MEAN\n\n10: The ultimate dining experience\n\n9-9.5: Sublime\n\n8-8.5: Excellent\n\n7-7.5: Good to very good\n\n6-6.5: Promising\n\n5-5.5: Average\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/scorecards-economy-earnings-jobs-could-make-or-break-bull-market", "site_title": "Scorecards on economy, earnings, jobs could make or break bull market", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nScorecards on economy, earnings, jobs could make or break bull market\n\nBut all these could be pushed aside by war developments at Ukrainian border, Israel and Palestine\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jul 27, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHIS week could make or break the bull market as scorecards on the broad economy, corporate earnings and jobs arrive along with a policy statement from the US Federal Reserve.\n\nAnd all these headlines could be pushed aside by war developments as Russian troops reportedly muster again on the Ukrainian border while Israel and Palestine bombard each other.\n\nThese conflicts are already affecting the global economy, and investor sentiment. Stocks fell sharply on Friday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished below the psychologically significant 17,000 level after disappointing earnings reports from Visa and Amazon.com. Credit-card processor Visa generates a substantial portion of its revenue in Russia, where sanctions and other fallout from the Ukrainian conflict have slowed spending.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon's investors have complained for some time about the online retailer's strategy of establishing long-term market-share dominance in various businesses over short-term profitability. When these pillars of the modern consumer economy shake, investors rush for cover.\n\nSeparately, a relatively weak June durable goods orders report outside the volatile transportation and defence sectors left economists wondering if corporate capital expenditure would ever come back. Judging by the capex component of the report, Amazon may be the only major American corporation sinking money into new premises, research and heavy equipment.\n\nIn response to the durable-goods report, some economists pared their forecast for second-quarter gross domestic product growth. Economists at brokerage Nomura Securities estimate economic output grew at the optimum level of 3 per cent in the second quarter. The economy has a hole to climb out of after the first-quarter freeze, and anything less than 2.9 per cent could hurt the stock market when the Commerce Department gives the first official read on second-quarter GDP on Wednesday.\n\nThe housing market is another worry. New-home sales growth slowed last month, while builder DR Horton, reporting a drop in quarterly profit, said that sales in the Chicago area were slow. Home price data this week is likely to be another reminder that most housing markets in the US have reached a plateau after the dramatic recovery from the 2009 crash. Should the Federal Reserve hint at plans for interest-rate hikes in its statement on Wednesday, housing stocks could take a further blow.\n\nInvestors do not expect any changes in course in the Fed's gradual retreat from stimulus. But the smallest shift in emphasis in Wednesday's statement will cause market ripples in the absence of a press conference this time around, said Quincy Krosby, investment strategist at Prudential Financial.\n\nThere were some positive signs last week: Facebook's earnings growth trounced analyst expectations again, and its shares rose to levels that made it the best performing stock on the Standard & Poor's 500 in the last 12 months. For Facebook and its chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, it's a vindication: The social network's shares had slumped in the immediate aftermath of its 2012 initial public offering because of fears it could not make any money off mobile users. Now, mobile advertising revenue is growing so fast that Facebook is catching up with the presumptive king of digital advertising Google. Another one of Facebook's Silicon Valley elders, Apple, impressed investors with its sales tally, and with hints that the new iPhone 6 is ready to go.\n\nBut Silicon Valley has been booming for a half decade. The rest of American industry has had fortunes more mixed. This week, earnings from energy giants such as Exxon Mobil and drug makers such as Pfizer may not be received with such aplomb.\n\nOn average, economists expect the Labour Department to report roughly 234,000 workers were added to US payrolls last month, and that the unemployment rate has retreated to 6.1 per cent. A \"miss\", or shortfall, on jobs growth would likely cause a sell-off; but a \"beat\", or higher-than-projected growth, may cause one, too. That's partly because of fears that a red-hot jobs market would encourage the Fed to react more quickly to recent signs of inflation and raise interest rates. It also reveals that many observers believe US workers are struggling in ways that are not captured by the data.\n\n\"The work force participation rate is a lot lower\" than it was before the recession and wage growth for unskilled workers has been negligible, said Carter Worth, chief market technician at brokerage Sterne Agee. \"And all the while, the cost of living has gone up.\"\n\nWhile broad inflation statistics show prices are stable, prices of the most vital staples for working families, such as petrol and chicken are at or near records, said Mr Worth.\n\nWall Street strategists have also picked up on negative signals in the markets themselves. Junk bonds, which are often the \"canary in the coal mine\", for the stock market, have been alarmingly weak this month, said Mr Krosby, investment strategist at Prudential Financial.\n\n\"We know that merger and acquisition activity is just gangbusters. M&A activity is very robust and makes records not at the market bottom, but at the market top,\" said Mr Worth.\n\n\"We've had a lot of corrections along the way; we haven't had in a while and we're due for one.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Buyers outweighed sellers with eight companies that recorded 21 purchases worth S$1.57 million versus four firms with nine disposals worth S$0.63 million. The buy figures were down from the previous week's 12 companies, 27 purchases, and S$1.9 million. On the selling side, the number of firms and trades were not far off from the previous week's five companies and five disposals. The sell value, however, was sharply down from the previous week's S$4.2 million.\n\nAlthough buyers outnumbered the sellers, the bulk of the significant director trades last week were disposals with sales in Hiap Hoe, Sky One Holdings, and M1 Ltd. On the positive front, a director of Pacific Radiance resumed buying after the stock rose by 35 per cent. Meanwhile, there were key institutional purchases in Biosensors International, Fortune Reit and Mapletree Commercial Trust.\n\nHiap Hoe\n\nNon-executive director Chan Wah Tiong recorded his first on-market trades in residential property developer Hiap Hoe Limited since the stock was listed in 2007 with the sale of his entire holdings (direct interest) of 94,000 shares on July 24 at an average of 91.2 cents each. The shares sold represented 0.02 per cent of the issued capital. The disposals were made on the back of the 17 per cent rise in the share price since February from 78 cents. The counter is also sharply up since October 2011 from 40 cents. The counter closed at 92 cents on Friday.\n\nSky One Holdings\n\nCOO Lau Hon Kit and CEO Dicky Suen Yiu Chung recorded their first on-market trades in integrated logistics services and customised solutions provider Sky One Holdings since October 2012 with a combined 1.05 million shares sold from July 21 to 24 at an average of 12.4 cents each. The disposals, which accounted for 27 per cent of the stock's trading volume, were made on the back of the 26 per cent rebound in the share price since May from 9.9 cents. The counter is also up since March from 7.5 cents. Despite the rebound in the share price, the stock is still down since October 2013 from 48 cents.\n\nMr Lau unloaded 545,000 shares on July 24 at 12.3 cents each, which reduced his direct holdings to 23.631 million shares or 7.38 per cent. He also has deemed interest of 13.219 million shares or 4.13 per cent. He previously sold two million shares in October 2012 at 33 cents each and 754,000 shares in May 2012 at 28 cents each. Prior to his sales since 2012, the COO acquired 159,000 shares from September to October 2008 at an average of 7.4 cents each and sold 251,000 shares in August 2008 at nine cents each.\n\nMr Suen, on the other hand, recorded his first on-market trades since his appointment in January 2008 with 500,000 shares sold from July 21 to 22 at an average of 12.5 cents each. The trades lowered his direct holdings to 15.968 million shares or 4.99 per cent. He also has deemed interest of 30.858 million shares or 9.64 per cent. The sales were made at a profit based on the 3.6 million shares that he acquired via exercise of options on June 10 at five cents each. The counter closed at 12.1 cents on Friday.\n\nM1 Limited\n\nCEO Karen Kooi Lee Wah resumed selling shares of mobile voice, data communications, broadband and fixed communications services provider M1 Limited at a higher price with 100,000 shares sold on July 24 at S$3.76 each. The trade reduced her direct holdings by 10 per cent to 900,000 shares or 0.097 per cent. The sale was made after the company announced on July 21 a 12.1 per cent gain in second quarter profit to S$43.9 million. Earnings in the first half rose by 8.2 per cent to S$86.7 million. She previously sold 100,000 shares on June 6 at S$3.56 each. The disposals in the past two months were made on the back of the rebound in the share price since December 2013 from S$3.17. The sales were made at a profit based on the one million shares that she acquired via exercise of options from Jan 10 to 15 at an average of US$2.04 each. Prior to her trades this year, the CEO sold 1.56 million shares from February to September 2013, some of which were options-related sales, at S$2.78 to S$3.40 each or an average of S$3.10 each. The stock closed at S$3.77 on Friday.\n\nPacific Radiance\n\nIndependent director Goh Chong Theng resumed buying shares of offshore vessels and support services provider Pacific Radiance at a higher price with 10,000 shares purchased on July 23 at S$1.39 each. The trade increased his direct holdings by 13 per cent to 90,000 shares or 0.01 per cent. The acquisition was made on the back of the 35 per cent rise in the share price since April 14 from S$1.03. He previously acquired 30,000 shares on April 4 at S$1.10 each and an initial 50,000 shares in November 2013 via allotment at 90 cents each.\n\nThe sentiment is not entirely positive this month as independent director Choo Boon Tiong unloaded his entire direct stake of 80,000 shares or 0.01 per cent on July 8 and 9 at an average of S$1.41 each. Those are his first on-market trades since the stock was listed in November 2013. Investors should note that non-executive director Yong Yin Min sold 1.15 million shares from May 19 to 29 at an average of S$1.22 each, which lowered his direct stake to 27.713 million shares or 3.82 per cent. Those disposals were made at a huge profit based on the 1.12 million shares that he acquired in November 2013 at 88 cents each. The stock closed at S$1.405 on Friday.\n\nBiosensors International\n\nFIL Limited became a substantial shareholder of medical devices developer and manufacturer Biosensors International on July 17 following the purchase of 6.2 million shares at 87.5 cents each. The trade increased its deemed holdings by 8 per cent to 86.066 million shares or 5.07 per cent. The initial filing was made on the back of the 15 per cent drop in the share price since May from S$1.025. The counter is also sharply down since February 2012 from S$1.675. Investors should note that there were buybacks by Biosensors earlier this year with 300,000 shares purchased on Feb 14 at 87 cents each. The group previously acquired 6.4 million shares from Dec 30, 2013, to Jan 8 at an average of 83.5 cents each, 21 million shares from August to October 2013 at an average of 88.2 cents each and 12.75 million shares from April to June 2013 at an average of S$1.15 each.\n\nPrior to the repurchases since April 2013, the company acquired 19.8 million shares from November to December 2012 at an average of S$1.11 each. The repurchases since November 2012 are the company's first buybacks since listing in May 2005. The counter closed at 87 cents on Friday.\n\nFortune Reit\n\nSchroder plc recorded its first notice in retail shopping malls investor Fortune Reit since May 2013 with a purchase-related filing on July 23 of 17,000 units at HK$7.27 each. The trade increased its deemed holdings to 243.057 million units or 13.0 per cent. The filing was made on the back of the 30 per cent rebound in the unit price since March from HK$5.60. The fund manager previously acquired 52.8 million units from January to May 2013 at HK$6.79 to HK$7.50 each. Prior to its purchases since 2013, the shareholder unloaded a net 17.8 million units from February 2011 to May 2012 at estimated prices of HK$3.57 to HK$4.29 each. Prior to its filings since 2011, the group acquired a net 142.7 million units from March 25, 2008, to Aug 12, 2010, at estimated prices of HK$5.15 to HK$2.20 each and an initial filing (for the second time since July 2005) on March 24, 2008, of 1.107 million units at HK$5.15 each, which raised its interest to 5.01 per cent. Overall, Schroder's stake is up by 160 per cent since that initial filing in March 2008. The unit trust closed at HK$7.20 on Friday.\n\nMapletree Commercial Trust\n\nAIA Group Limited recorded its first buy in real estate investment trust Mapletree Commercial Trust since it became a substantial shareholder in April 2011 with a purchase-related filing on July 23 of 181,000 units at S$1.38 each. The trade increased its deemed holdings to 125.680 million units or 6.01 per cent. The group previously reported a disposal-related filing on June 12 of 2.5 million units at S$1.29 each. The notices in the past two months were made on the back of the rebound in the unit price since December 2013 from S$1.135.\n\nPrior to its filings this year, the shareholder reported a disposal-related filing in November 2013 of 618,000 units at S$1.21 each. Before that, the group became a substantial shareholder in April 2011 after it subscribed for an initial 142.045 million units or 7.63 per cent in the IPO at 88 cents each.\n\nInvestors should note that there were purchases by Schroders plc and non-executive director Hiew Yoon Khong this year. Schroders reported a purchase-related filing on May 19 of 15,000 units at S$1.34 each, which boosted its deemed stake to 125.089 million units or 6.0 per cent. The group previously reported an initial filing on Feb 24 of 74,000 units at S$1.18 each, which raised its interest to 5.0 per cent. Overall, Schroders' stake is up by 20 per cent since that initial filing in February.\n\nMr Hiew, on the other hand, purchased 110,000 units on April 24 at S$1.29 each, which increased his deemed holdings to 2.320 million units or 0.11 per cent. He also has direct interest of 489,000 units of 0.02 per cent. He previously acquired 210,000 units on Feb 17 at S$1.19 each. Prior to his purchases this year, the director acquired 200,000 units in October 2013 at S$1.27 each and 600,000 units in June 2013 at S$1.22 each. The purchases by Mr Hiew since June 2013 are his first on-market trades since the unit trust was listed in April 2011. It closed at S$1.405 on Friday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In a press release, GIC said that its investment in Flipkart stems from its belief in the strong growth potential of India's e-tailing industry.\n\nFlipkart's latest round of funding is one of the largest for any e-commerce company globally - and the single largest by an Internet company from India.\n\nIt will use the funds to make long-term strategic investments in the Internet space in India, especially in mobile technology.\n\nOther investors in this latest round of funding by Flipkart include existing investors Accel Partners, DST Global, Iconiq Capital, Morgan Stanley Investment Management and Sofina.\n\nFlipkart founders Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal said: \"The focus at Flipkart is to continue to make shopping online simpler and more accessible through the use of technology. We have close to 22 million registered users today. We handle five million shipments a month.\n\n\"These numbers were unheard of a few years back and we are excited about the scale we have managed to achieve. But what is even more exciting is the huge opportunity that we still see before us.\n\nIndia has 243 million Internet users and this number continues to grow very fast, they added. \"We want to enable every Indian to either shop or sell online. And we believe that the power of the mobile Internet is going to help us achieve this goal.\n\n\"By 2020, India will have more than half a billion mobile Internet users. Our intense focus on mobile and technology puts us in a unique position to take advantage of this massive opportunity.\n\n\"This new funding will enable us to step up our investments for innovations in products and technologies, setting us up to become the mobile e-commerce company of the future.\"\n\nGIC said that Flipkart's pioneering efforts in putting Indian e-commerce on the global map have led to initiatives that have \"redefined the ecosystem, becoming trendsetters\".\n\n\"Innovation in supply-chain and technology has been a part of Flipkart's DNA - including Cash on Delivery, Payzippy, a dedicated logistics, In-a-Day guarantee in 50 cities and the subscription service Flipkart First.\"\n\nLaunched in October 2007, Flipkart.com now offers over 15 million products across more than 70 categories, including books, media, consumer electronics and lifestyle. It employs some 14,000, and its registered users now clock over four million daily visits.\n\nGIC is a leading global investment firm with well over US$100 billion in assets under management.

What do the firms need to have most when venturing abroad?\n\nPublished Sun, Jul 27, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nOlivia Lum\n\nExecutive Chairman and Group CEO\n\nHyflux\n\nTHERE are many Singapore companies that have established themselves globally in their industries. The brand value of \"Singapore Inc\" has contributed to the overseas success stories of Singapore businesses.\n\nAt Hyflux, we started to explore new territories some 20 years ago. Even back in the 1990s, we realised that our growth and expansion would be limited if we only looked within our borders. Recognising the tremendous potential of China and Africa, we became one of the earliest Singapore companies to make a footprint in the emerging markets through investments and execution of large projects there. To date, we have some of the largest desalination plants in the world in Algeria and China.\n\nIt is critical for companies going overseas to understand the local business landscape, laws and culture. Companies venturing abroad must have an appreciation of and willingness to adapt to local business cultures, have a sense of adventure, courage and patience when heading out to lesser-known territories. There are definitely risks, but if managed well, the results are very fulfilling.\n\nLukas Raska\n\nChief Operating Officer, Apac\n\nESET\n\nSINGAPORE is an ideal breeding ground for business, with strong home-grown entrepreneurial talent. For Singapore companies, the wider region presents a myriad of exciting market opportunities with the chance to target millions of new customers.\n\nIt's no surprise then that Singapore businesses continue to expand their horizons into neighbouring markets. Going regional has its challenges, however, particularly due to the inescapable differences between markets in such a diverse economic landscape.\n\nAs a company which has a presence in all major markets across the region, we know that having the right in-market partners, distributors and resellers to provide cultural knowledge and invaluable market insight is essential for ensuring the success of any venture abroad. Business starts and ends with relationships and will always be crucial for any Singapore enterprise looking to position itself for success in a foreign marketplace.\n\nYeoh Oon Jin\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nPwC Singapore\n\nMANY local businesses are indeed venturing overseas given the relatively small size of the Singapore market coupled with challenges around manpower and rising costs. There are many obstacles Singapore firms face going overseas, but those who recognise and overcome them do very well.\n\nThe key is to understand where Singapore's strength lies. Trustworthiness and integrity are qualities that differentiate the Singapore businessman. Singapore companies who are successful abroad are those who make the extra effort to understand and embrace the local culture while ensuring that business risks are mitigated. The ability to apply Western management concepts while maintaining Eastern values makes the Singapore businessman an ideal business partner.\n\nOne key remaining challenge, however, is that with the competition for talent being so intense, management bandwidth will be stretched when companies venture overseas without additional resources.\n\nIn a nutshell, successful businesses are the ones that begin the localisation journey the moment they set foot in another country. Many of them are reaping the benefits of this forward-looking step now.\n\nPang Yee Ean\n\nCEO\n\nSurbana International Consultants\n\nSINGAPORE Inc is a trusted brand overseas that's often associated with high quality and reliability. Singapore companies must treasure this unique status and the respect earned by our earlier business and political leaders. Singapore companies should also strive to maintain this hard-earned reputation by conducting their businesses overseas responsibly and with integrity.\n\nThere are always inherent challenges in entering new markets, which is why selecting good local partners on the ground is important. Good partners reduce our risks with their local establishment and network. For Surbana, we are taking it a step further by looking into strategic acquisitions to enter new markets. This will also allow us to grow our global talent base and increase our competitiveness in overseas markets.\n\nLaletha Nithiyanandan\n\nManaging Director\n\nTalent Design Potential\n\nSINGAPORE is often the first stop for international businesses coming to Asia so our firms are used to competing with these companies and in this way have more going for them when it comes to doing business overseas. However, many of us rely on efficiency and effectiveness as competitive tools to gain growth in other markets. But this is not as important in some countries, and so one of the areas that Singapore firms struggle with has to do with building relationships and using local expertise to guide us in penetrating that market. We tend to have a low threshold for inefficiency and take ourselves too seriously. Taking Singapore Inc to the next level requires us to learn how to not compare everything to Singapore but instead to fall in love with the virtues and advantages that each market has to offer and a willingness to live somewhere else for some time.\n\nThomas Klotz\n\nManaging Partner, South-east Asia\n\nRoland Berger Strategy Consultants\n\nBANKING typically is not a sector in which companies are able to achieve major market shares abroad. Most countries are protective of their banking system and incumbents. It would take a very liberal government or regulator and a small country for foreign banks to have any chance at dominating - New Zealand comes to mind as the only example in Asia-Pacific.\n\nThere is no reason for Singapore firms to not be successful abroad, but they will have to go through a learning curve: what works at home does not necessarily work outside - localisation is key. This has to be accompanied by the acceptance of higher risks and flexibility in managing. Mistakes and failures will be made; these will need to be accepted as the cost of doing business and have to be addressed quickly, serving as a source of rapid learning.\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nFOR years, several local brands and companies have been flying the Singapore flag high on the world stage, with names like Singapore Airlines, Tiger Beer, BreadTalk and OSIM easily coming to mind. Aside from these stalwarts, Singapore Inc has gained more traction in recent years thanks to some newer players on the scene such as the Spa Esprit Group and Thai Express, which are enjoying growing success in the region and beyond.\n\nFor firms to effectively venture abroad, they require not only solid balance sheets but also to first and foremost conduct proper feasibility studies and do in-depth research into the viability of the market they intend to enter. Failure to do their homework will severely negate their chances of success.\n\nBesides sufficient business preparation, they should also look into tapping any government grants or assistance that supports such overseas expansion programmes. Having the right supportive framework and ecosystem in place can make all the difference when venturing into unknown territories.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPLAN-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\nSINGAPORE Inc has had limited success overseas. Most of it can be claimed by our GLCs (government-linked companies). Sharing the honours list are a few large homegrown companies, such as OSIM, Hyflux and Tee Yih Jia. We still have some way to go to have more successful homegrown companies on the global stage, in terms of geographical coverage and magnitude of business. The banking sector is not a good example. Host countries' financial regulations and requirements make it near-impossible for Singapore banks to build scale and a presence to be of any challenge to the entrenched local players.\n\nThat said, Singapore companies in other industries can emulate the success of OSIM, Hyflux and Tee Yih Jia. If there is one area where local firms can venture abroad and be very successful, it is to own intellectual property. Although the risks are high, the returns are also very high. It is all about finding the killer app that meets a compelling need to allow the company to transcend all global barriers and reach. Creative Technology has demonstrated this before. There is, therefore, no reason why Singapore Inc cannot produce more clones of Creative.\n\nDavid Crammond\n\nFounder and CEO\n\nMaachu\n\nTO foreign companies and their governments, mention Singapore Inc and they think of the government-linked and not private sector companies, which have made an impact on foreign soil.\n\nWith the exception of a handful of successful companies, the direct footprint of Singapore companies overseas is not significant in global terms. In my opinion, the main reason is a lack of understanding of the clients' needs in the overseas markets. Singapore Inc tends to focus on building their businesses to \"work in Singapore\". What needs to be done is to \"build the business to work anywhere\". We must not forget that what works here may not necessarily work outside Singapore.\n\nI have met many budding entrepreneurs in Singapore and found that their ideas are just not scalable. This is because they are focused on the unique opportunities and challenges in Singapore. When asked about overseas expansion, they have either not thought about it or have done only basic research. One solution to this \"lack of market insight\" is to bring in experienced outside talent to help drive overseas strategies and growth.\n\nAnother solution is to tap our overseas Singaporean talents by luring them back and giving them leadership roles. For entrepreneurs and companies, there must be attractive incentives to encourage them to expand beyond the shores of Singapore and spread their wings and hopefully over time, Singapore Inc will have more footprints globally.\n\nKong Chee Min\n\nGroup Chief Executive Officer\n\nCenturion Corporation\n\nMAKING an impact overseas is a challenge, not only for Singaporean firms but also for companies worldwide looking to operate in a foreign market outside of their own. Singapore remains Centurion Corporation's home market but over the last two years, we have successfully ventured overseas into Malaysia, Australia and the United Kingdom providing workers' and student accommodation. From our own experience, we believe that firms must be able to comfortably leverage their current expertise and strengths in Singapore before moving to capture opportunities abroad.\n\nFirms need to understand the key differences in the foreign market, such as its economic situation and outlook, considering how these factors may impact their own operations, best practices, and financial standing, for example.\n\nWithout a clear strategy of what they wish to accomplish in the targeted overseas markets, companies may find that their investment falls short of their expectations. Firms should recognise that success is based on a prudent approach when venturing abroad, requiring a long-term view in their investment approach.\n\nMax Loh\n\nCountry Managing Partner\n\nErnst & Young LLP\n\nSEVERAL notable Singapore companies have grown into global players in their fields; yet many can do better at venturing abroad. Companies have traditionally entered new markets through partnering local distributors or contract manufacturing, but not many have truly entrenched their presence. When venturing overseas, companies need highly flexible business models to respond to new opportunities and risks. Increasingly, success depends on the level of granularity and customisation in analysing and capturing opportunities, and developing new routes to markets, including acquisitions as a quick and enabling way.\n\nAlso, supply chain effectiveness is important, in addition to product innovation, branding, sales and marketing. It is also important to establish an operating model that balances headquarter and local empowerment for responsive decision-making. Additionally, there is the need for diverse talent both in management and teams, to ensure the necessary mix of global and local market perspectives that are needed to drive tailored strategies for different markets and customer segments.\n\nSonya Madeira\n\nManaging Partner\n\nRice Communications\n\nSINGAPORE firms have for many years been encouraged to internationalise. We are seeing a growing number of Singapore companies entering frontier markets like Myanmar, where there has been successful trade delegations from Singapore's logistics, oil and gas, and financial sectors in recent months. Agencies like International Enterprise (IE) Singapore and Economic Development Board should also be lauded for their efforts in helping local companies expand abroad.\n\nHowever, these initiatives can only do so much. What is most important is a sound cultural understanding of the market they are entering. We have all heard of large corporations going confidently into a market only to pull out later. In many instances, it was not due to their business model but their inability to adapt to local market conditions. A country's culture ultimately should shape the way firms behave and strategise. Investing time to understand how business is conducted and immersing in the local way of life will bode well for Singapore firms looking to spread their wings overseas.\n\nToh Han Li\n\nChief Executive\n\nCompetition Commission of Singapore\n\nGIVEN its limited domestic market, Singapore has been encouraging local firms to venture abroad to expand their market base. To this end, various financing and assistance schemes have been established by government agencies to help firms internationalise. Trade agreements such as the Transpacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), when concluded, will offer firms benefits like tariff reductions, greater market access and fair competition.\n\nAt the government level, we also strive to harmonise regulations and technical requirements across borders so as to reduce uncertainty and regulatory costs for firms as they navigate overseas laws and regulations. At the same time, firms need to possess certain critical success factors to ensure success in their overseas ventures including a deep understanding of the relevant market as well as staying competitive, innovative and responsive to customers' needs.\n\nRon Totton\n\nManaging Director, South-east Asia\n\nBT Global Services\n\nIT infrastructure and technology-related factors stand in the way of Singapore organisations expanding overseas. According to our latest Art of Connecting Global Business survey, an overwhelming majority (96 per cent) of Singapore business leaders say they are hindered by the digital infrastructure of their most desired markets and therefore find it difficult to expand into those markets. They also find their organisations' current technology inadequate. They believe having \"reliable communications amongst all branches/territories\" is the most crucial in contributing towards the successful operation of an organisation.\n\nThe study also highlighted that Singapore businesses cited the United States and Hong Kong as their desired destinations for expansion due to their potential customer base, followed by China, Indonesia and Thailand.\n\nTechnology and networks can transform the environment in which these businesses operate, at home and abroad. They help to orchestrate businesses, bring people together, identify opportunities and allow Singapore businesses to deliver great business outcomes.\n\nTang Boon Ping\n\nDirector, Asia\n\nLinksys and Belkin\n\nEXPANSION should always be on the radar for organisations, big or small, but organisations need to ensure that this is in line with their business objectives before undertaking such a move. It is important to recognise that the business environment in countries differ and as such, venturing abroad is very different to expanding locally. Through Linksys' expansion in this region and having successfully established ourselves in several markets, we found three \"must-haves\" for success - flexibility, people and marketing.\n\nThere is never a one-size-fits-all model for operations and organisations need to be flexible to adapt to local market conditions, while its people need to adopt an open mindset to understand the local idiosyncrasies of the market. Marketing is then the final piece of the puzzle that is critical in brand establishment, understanding and reaching out to the right target segments for growth.\n\nStephen McNulty\n\nManaging Director,\n\nAsia-Pacific and Japan\n\nProgress Software\n\nTHE number of Singapore companies that have successfully expanded overseas over the years is commendable. Data from IE Singapore found that more than 26,000 Singapore companies were seeking business opportunities overseas in 2013, of which over 85 per cent were small and medium enterprises (SMEs). With stiff competition from local players in the overseas markets, especially those who are able to offer competitive price points for their products and services, Singapore companies can succeed by establishing strategic partnerships with local players and authorities. Based on our experience in the technology industry, we have seen how collaborations with local government agencies help Singapore businesses thrive in overseas markets. Singapore startups looking to venture into emerging markets can work with local agencies like Indonesia's Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology and the Philippines' Department of Science and Technology to identify pain points faced by local enterprises, which can help them better develop and deploy the right solution that meets the needs of the end-users.\n\nDumont Jean-Michel\n\nChairman\n\nRuder Finn Asia\n\nSINGAPORE has in the last 49 years developed a very strong brand name for itself. We have seen government agencies as well as homegrown brands roll out brand campaigns to position Made-in-Singapore products and services that are built on trust, quality and innovation, having recently claimed the top spot for Asia in the recent Global Innovation Index (GII).\n\nAs Singapore continues to play on the global economic stage, efforts to strengthen the country's brand must remain, if not intensify. Beyond country branding, companies must also look at their communication infrastructure as this is fundamental to their success - an area where Singapore companies can do much more regionally and globally.\n\nDeveloping and implementing a robust communication roadmap that dovetails the company's business plans not only enhances its brand but also protect its reputation. This will help augment the company's business development efforts, achieving the desired results. The communication must also be all-encompassing, helping to set the stage and positioning the company in the right space regionally and globally from the very onset.\n\nHerbert Vongpusanachai\n\nManaging Director\n\nDHL Express Singapore\n\nINTERNATIONALISATION is no longer an option but a necessity for Singapore companies who want to enjoy strong and sustainable growth. By expanding their footprints abroad, these firms can escape the confines of our limited domestic market by capitalising on the many opportunities present in our growing Asian neighbours, such as China and Myanmar.\n\nIn 2013, a heartening 46 per cent of local SMEs already have overseas operations, and of these, 43 per cent are generating up to 30 per cent of revenue from abroad. We believe that the internationalisation trend will continue to grow as Singapore further enhances government initiatives to provide companies with funding to expand globally.\n\nBesides capital, businesses will also need to overcome the complexities of shipping overseas and have the right network to reach their target customers. By partnering with a logistics provider such as DHL, companies will not need to worry about customs and will also have constant visibility on their shipments' status. Additionally, DHL has a global reach of 120,000 destinations in over 220 countries and territories, allowing businesses to reach their target buyers quickly and effectively.\n\nPhilippe Huinck\n\nRegional Managing Director, South and South-east Asia\n\nInternational SOS\n\nINNOVATION is critical if you want to grow. Without creating new products and solutions, existing offerings quickly become commoditised and it becomes difficult to stay ahead of the competition. It is important to always have a customer-centric mindset and look at how the company can adapt to customers' changing needs.\n\nCross-cultural management is another key factor. It is important for a Singapore company to have emotional intelligence and bear in mind cultural differences when venturing overseas. It impacts how clearly your company's values will be perceived amongst stakeholders such as your customers, regulators and employees.\n\nThe success of International SOS is based on innovation, adaptation and continuous evolution. Founded and headquartered in Singapore almost 30 years ago, the company has grown from strength to strength. The company started small, offering 24-hour medical care and evacuation services with a single control centre in Singapore in 1985. With increasing corporate travel and rising medical costs, our founders saw the need to provide Western multinationals in South-east Asia with top-notch medical services for expatriate staff. It was a whole new concept that just hadn't existed before at that time. From the early medical services, other areas of business were subsequently established, and the company started to offer security planning, medical consulting and crisis management in addition.\n\nInternational SOS has come a long way as we expanded over the years, operating in over 89 countries today. But our mission has not changed - we continue to help organisations protect their employees across the globe. Singapore remains our home to a diverse workforce comprising Singaporeans and 29 other nationalities. We are proud to have contributed to, and be a part of, Singapore's growth here and abroad.\n\nDaniel Soh\n\nManaging Partner\n\nLeadership Advisory Inc\n\nON the whole, Singapore Inc has done well overseas. We can take a quick look at Keppel Corp, CapitaLand, Hyflux, BreadTalk Group, Charles & Keith, OSIM, Adam Khoo Learning Centre, Pico Art ... and many more. It is never easy to start. But over the years, Singapore businesses (and leaders) have earned a strong reputation of delivering high-quality products, impeccable integrity and the discipline of getting things done.\n\nFor companies venturing overseas, they have to be mindful of the myriad of differences, from culture and language to regulatory regimes, and economic maturity means that companies cannot apply a one-size-fits all solution. For this reason, products and services, as well as business strategy, have to be localised to ensure that they address the specific needs of the local market.\n\nBesides possessing the hard science of market knowledge and competitive analysis, business leaders driving the growth must also possess the soft skills, which include having the highest standards of integrity, adaptability, flexibility and agility to respond quickly to a changing business environment.\n\nNeeraj Swaroop\n\nChief Executive Officer, Singapore\n\nStandard Chartered Bank\n\nWITH Singapore being an entrep\u00f4t economy, having access to regional and global markets is important for Singapore-based companies. Increasingly, our clients are looking to expand overseas. Smaller Singapore companies tend to look towards expanding in Asean countries such as Malaysia and Thailand, while larger ones with the capacity to go further geographically set their sights on China, India and even Africa.\n\nWhen venturing overseas, SMEs may face challenges such as operating in an unknown market, understanding domestic regulations, obtaining marketing intelligence and most importantly, funding.\n\nClients' feedback showed that having the right partner with in-depth knowledge of local market conditions and the ability to open doors and arrange for funding, will help them greatly in getting their operations running smoothly in the new market.\n\nStanChart's Global Account Managers who coordinate the financial requirements of SME operations overseas across multiple geographies have been assisting clients with their expansion plans by connecting them to the right people and arranging for funding by leveraging the strength of the clients' Singapore operations. This is how we value-add to clients and help them fulfil their business ambitions.\n\nKanwal Nain Sahney\n\nManaging Director\n\nSpecvision\n\nSINGAPORE is the regional hub for finance, distribution and in providing headquarter functions for both multinational corporations (MNCs) and homegrown firms. The government has been successful in pursuing the policy of internationalisation. Foreign direct investment by Singapore firms rose four times to S$400 billion from the year 2000 to 2010. It was just S$17 billion in 1990. This is impressive, but the corporate value creation overseas largely remained concentrated either in a handful of sectors or in setting up industrial parks. The fact is that we could never truly penetrate consumer or mass market segments abroad. Key reasons contributing to this scenario are: unfamiliarity with local laws; language barrier; and above all, lack of an entrepreneurial ecosystem back home.\n\nMoody's recent survey results about how Singapore banks fare in the neighbouring markets, therefore, do not come as a surprise. Over the past couple of years, this story has been unfolding with a new twist. Rising costs and acute manpower shortage at home are driving local firms either out of business or to relocate operations elsewhere.\n\nTo venture abroad we need to integrate the Singapore quality, brand and reputation into our products. Due diligence in identifying niche sectors like hospitality, infrastructure, research and development, logistics, waste management, as well as good local joint venture partners and a good understanding of the overseas country's laws are imperative. Our government can continue to play an active role in helping to bridge partnerships.\n\nLee Fook Chiew\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nInstitute of Singapore Chartered Accountants\n\nSINGAPORE firms are in a good position as the government has a slew of initiatives to support their internationalisation efforts. However, SMEs also need to have the right knowledge, network and infrastructure. For example, they need to have an understanding of local cultural nuances, laws and regulations and cross-border taxation requirements besides having suitable business partners and systems. SMEs can mitigate these challenges by tapping on the expertise of our accounting firms, including the small and medium practitioners (SMPs). Our accounting firms possess specialist knowledge in areas like tax and regulations, making them suitable business advisers.\n\nIn addition, SMPs, being SMEs themselves, can provide more personalised services based on their intimate knowledge of their clients' strength, weaknesses and needs. To better help their clients globalise, our SMPs can bolster their capabilities by joining international accounting networks or partner foreign SMPs where they can further leverage on existing local expertise and infrastructure.\n\nRobert Wilkes\n\nManaging Director, Singapore\n\nTowers Watson\n\nACCORDING to Towers Watson's Asian Trailblazers study, Singaporean companies have so far adopted well-defined globalisation strategies, adapting quickly to the challenges brought on by Asia's rapid growth environment. Singapore's business leaders must become even more comfortable with the region's ambiguity and develop skills that are effective in cross-cultural contexts to ensure their success continues. Some understanding of how their offering is likely to be perceived in a new market is important and a structured mergers and acquisitions (M&A) approach is vital if they plan to expand via a merger or acquisition, given the changing nature of this area and the shorter time between deal announcement and completion. Companies also need intelligent talent management strategies. If internationally mobile employees are expected to fill critical overseas positions, marketable retention plans will be key.\n\nTom Evrard\n\nManaging Director\n\nFTI Consulting Strategic Communications Singapore\n\nWITH the support of organisations such as IE Singapore, Singaporean companies, and indeed companies across South-east Asia, have been stepping up the expansion of their global footprints, both through M&A and organic growth. We see stakeholder engagement and reputation management as key success factors for companies taking this step, as they face new unknown audiences, increased scrutiny and new regulatory regimes and business environments that have to be navigated.\n\nThe media can be a key channel through which to raise awareness, build trust and demonstrate commitment to a new market, so it's important that expansionist companies are armed with a strong media relations strategy. They also need a well-planned approach to engagement with regulators and other relevant authorities - starting conversations early with key decision-makers can make or break M&A transactions and strengthen an organisation's market-entry efforts.\n\nIt is also important to recognise the value of integration planning, should expansion be through M&A, as well as the cultural challenges that a Singaporean firm may have with employees in new markets so that new workforces understand the shared goals to realise both value and the new global vision.\n\nLionel Lee\n\nGroup CEO and Managing Director\n\nEzra Holdings\n\nEXPANDING a business overseas can be very challenging and is certainly not for the faint-hearted. However, the key to success is careful planning. Companies should ensure that they allocate the necessary time, resources and investment to a new overseas venture. Leaders of organisations will need to invest significant time and energy into overseeing the launch of a new overseas venture. For example, when Ezra took over the office in Houston after our acquisition of AMC in 2011, I had to stay in Houston for an extended period of time, relocating with my family, in order to oversee the set-up of the business. Companies also need to be mindful of the cultural differences and regulations that might impact their operations in a new country; hiring local talent on the ground is essential to navigate these challenges.\n\nJohn Keung\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nBuilding and Construction Authority\n\nCOMPANIES from Singapore's built environment sector have been active in emerging markets such as China, South-east Asia, India and the Middle East. Their overseas projects include residential and infrastructure ones, averaging S$2.2 billion of construction volume a year from 2004 to 2013.\n\nTo succeed in overseas ventures, Singapore firms need to have good corporate governance, be agile in adapting to changing local business conditions, have a good knowledge of the local business culture and suitable local partners. To this end, the Building and Construction Authority has been assisting Singapore companies by providing market intelligence through seminars and overseas trade missions, as well as promoting Singapore's niche construction capabilities and services overseas. We also promote quality and timely delivery as the hallmark of our firms venturing overseas.\n\nMany Singapore firms are now enjoying the success of exporting consultancy works in the areas of green building, master planning, MEP (Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing) engineering designs as well as our know-how in Building Information Modelling (BIM).\n\nKoh Wee Lih\n\nCEO\n\nAIMS AMP Capital Industrial Reit\n\nSINGAPORE is a regional hub across a number of industries from financial services, property services to logistics. Companies based in Singapore enjoy the advantages of an established and open economy with clear regulations and policies in place. As they expand overseas, they take with them successful business models backed with capital. Nonetheless, to successfully establish a presence in a foreign market, strong networks and relationships on the ground are essential.\n\nIn February this year, AIMS AMP Capital Industrial Reit leveraged the local networks of its sponsors AIMS Financial Group and AMP Capital to expand its geographic footprint and enter Australia. With the strong networks on the ground, the Trust successfully acquired 49 per cent of indirect interest in Optus Centre in New South Wales in a complex transaction with the strong support of its sponsors. The acquisition strengthened the Reit's asset base, diversified its portfolio and ensured greater returns to unit holders. It is a great example of the importance of having a strong offshore network to understand and tap the local market.\n\nLeong Soo Yee\n\nSingapore Head\n\nAcca\n\nIN a 2011 Acca (Association of Chartered Certified Accountants) survey commissioned by the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (Acra), an overwhelming majority of Singapore's SMPs in the accountancy sector recognised that expanding overseas will provide an avenue for future growth and risk diversification. However, nearly three quarters of them sourced only 5 per cent or less of their revenue from clients located outside Singapore. This brings into focus the enormous unrealised potential waiting to be tapped by SMPs.\n\nTo facilitate expansion, SMPs need to familiarise themselves with foreign regulations, as well as come to grips with cultural and language differences. These were the most common impediments to overseas expansion and SMPs would do well to address these challenges early. Assistance from a trusted foreign partner may alleviate some of these \"teething problems\". Individual firms may also explore how they can collaborate with other SMPs or large audit firms in Singapore to launch a broader and more robust value proposition to foreign partners and clients. Other spin-offs in collaborating with other like-minded local firms may include referrals of audits and other engagements and the sharing of best practices.\n\nWhile we enumerate the challenges, we should not overlook the inherent advantages that Singapore SMPs have over their counterparts in the region, in particular their long familiarity with global standards on financial reporting, audit and ethics. Most firms are also already managing a multi-cultural mix of clients. These comparative advantages will ensure that Singapore SMPs who set their sights on expanding overseas will be equipped to play an active part in developing the \"external wing\" of Singapore's accountancy sector.\n\nNasim Shahzad\n\nManaging Director\n\nMeinhardt Singapore Pte Ltd\n\nTHE Singapore domestic market is small. The cost of doing business in Singapore is high, including manpower costs due to a limited labour supply. Consequently, Singapore private sector companies are relatively small.\n\nArguably, Singapore's success is down to an inward investment-based model where the focus has been on creating a business-friendly environment where foreign MNCs can thrive. This is due to Singapore's sterling reputation for good governance. However, this may have hampered the success and growth of homegrown firms.\n\nSteps to remedy this situation include strong government support and fostering entrepreneurship in an entrenched risk-averse culture. This culture is seen in the difficulties in obtaining funding support from Singapore banks due to a conservative approach to business that does not support overseas ventures.\n\nThe framework to develop Singapore Inc overseas is in place but we must continue to evolve a unique model that works for Singapore. We need to move on from a value-supporting and value-adding role to create value through innovation and entrepreneurship. As the Ministry of Trade and Industry has rightly pointed out, much of it \"depends on whether our human capital is able to develop to its fullest extent and realise its potential\".\n\nThe globalisation of Singapore companies requires not just strong support from government agencies, embassies and local banks but, more importantly, the willingness of Singaporeans to relocate overseas. Unfortunately, the number of people who are willing to be posted overseas is extremely limited. This will inevitably limit the growth of Singapore Inc overseas.\n\nAnnie Yap\n\nManaging Director\n\nAYP Associates Pte Ltd\n\nGENERALLY, Singapore Inc has not been that successful overseas with the exception of a few well-recognised retail and F&B brands such as Charles & Keith, OSIM and Paradise Group. When venturing abroad, what firms need the most is government support, a local network and an understanding of their environment. The government has indeed been providing us entrepreneurs with support via various organisations such as Spring and IE, be it in funding, branding or manpower training for our staff to venture abroad. Other considerations that the firms need to have would be a well-researched business plan - draft the worst-case scenario, be prepared for a two-year lead time - and the boldness to have the vision of expanding overseas. Compared to other countries, Singapore's entrepreneurial culture is rich. And, slowly but surely, more of the younger Singaporeans are choosing to set up their own businesses. Overtime, I am sure we will see more and more successful Singapore businesses overseas.\n\nAlan Leong\n\nVice President, Asia-Pacific\n\nSilver Peak\n\nFACTORS such as plentiful land, labour and resources may be driving forces for Singapore Inc to expand overseas. However, as businesses become more sophisticated, fundamental elements that govern the survival and fuel the meteoric success of new entrants in any environment are data availability, cyber security and network performance. The primary challenge of offshore expansion for firms is their ability to replicate solid control over those elements on foreign soil, while seeking alignment in business operations across borders. The problem is compounded when markets differ in regulatory policies and industrial benchmarks such as trade agreements, data sovereignty laws and network connectivity standards.\n\nWhile businesses can only learn to adapt to native policies, they are empowered to adopt technology, such as WAN optimisation, which ensures maximal network performance across headquarters and satellite offices. With optimal data transfer rates and unabated business connectivity across boundaries, firms become fundamentally more resilient to deal with market forces beyond their control.\n\nChris Comer\n\nCEO and Property Developer\n\nCastlewood Group\n\nREPUTATION is key when expanding overseas, and Singapore firms are fortunate to have an extremely strong foundation as a modern city known for its success as an efficient and effective business hub - capped off by an extremely accessible location and a forward-thinking government.\n\nHowever, certain industries will always struggle - such as the banking sector competing with local incumbent wide-scale rivals in neighbouring countries - and for a firm to truly validate itself when setting up shop in other markets it will still have to rely on the strength of the goods or services that it provides. Sustainable expansion must always be at the forefront for a Singaporean-based company to ensure survival.\n\nBefore Castlewood Group began building our flagship luxury buy-to-lease hotel property development in Thailand for Singaporean investors, we kept true to the age-old tried-and-tested property rule of location, location, location, and ensured that Phuket was proven to be the tourist mecca for Asia in the years ahead. As you look into other markets for business opportunities to either establish a presence or for the next venture, the company needs to have done its due diligence and have its bases covered.

Between 120-125 cargoes are forecast to be fixed for the whole of August, the broker said.\n\nRates for VLCC cargoes from West Africa to Asia recouped the losses from the previous week as tight tonnage matched the limited cargo demand. \"We're not seeing a lot of West Africa cargoes in the market, although we are expecting charterers to come in,\" the broker said.\n\nRates for a VLCC voyage on the benchmark route from the Middle East to Japan rose to W52.50 on the Worldscale measure on Thursday from W46 a week ago.\n\nRates for West Africa to China climbed to W52.50 on Thursday against W47.75 a week earlier. \"The general sentiment is firm for the VLCCs for the time being,\" Norwegian ship broker Fearnley said in a note on Thursday.\n\nIn other trades, rates for 80,000-tonne aframax tankers from South-east Asia to East Coast Australia climbed to W109.75 on Thursday from W96.25 a week earlier buoyed by general positive sentiment and an increase in cargoes.\n\nClean tanker rates from Singapore to Japan edged up to W108.25 on Thursday, against W107.50 a week ago amid tighter vessel supply, a Singapore clean tanker broker said.

At first glance, this indicates customers are taking longer to pay back the firm.\n\nAnother reason for higher receivables and revenue is the termination of an asset financing programme Yongmao used to have.\n\nAsset financing packages were kept at around 10 per cent of sales to keep the company's finances conservative, Yongmao's chief financial officer, Yap Soon Yong said.\n\nBut tighter credit in the Chinese economy last year caused the bank that Yongmao worked with to stop offering asset financing to the firm and its customers, he said.\n\nOne effect is to bring forward revenue recognition, and cause customers, now bereft of an asset financing package, to ask for longer payment terms.\n\nPreviously, revenue from these customers was recognised more slowly, over the course of the customer repaying its loan from the bank.\n\nNo receivables were recognised for these bank-financed sales. Instead, the balance borrowed by the customer was recorded in deferred income and deferred costs.\n\nCashflow to the company improves when customers take up asset financing packages because the bank pays the full amount to Yongmao after 90 days. These packages also served as a marketing tool.\n\nWithout an asset financing package, customers who do not immediately have cash on hand are asking for a longer time to pay for their purchases, beyond the usual 90 days.\n\n\"We still want to do business and the Chinese customers are of good quality, so we extended payment terms to 120 to 180 days,\" Mr Yap said.\n\nBecause sales are now all recorded directly, revenue is recognised immediately, instead of over a period of time under a bank financing package.\n\nThe balance that the customer owes also gets recorded in receivables immediately. This led to part of the higher revenue and receivables.\n\nBut the firm has no problems with bad debt as customers pay back their commitments, said general manager Sun Tian.\n\nA 30 per cent downpayment, required by Yongmao, also helps.\n\n\"When I first started out, state-owned enterprises were offering 30 per cent downpayment while we insisted on 100 per cent. Then now they offer 0 per cent downpayment. And we offer 30 per cent,\" he said.\n\nBecause the proportion of sales made through asset financing was relatively small, the effect of the lack of asset financing was not big, Mr Yap said.\n\nNevertheless, the company is talking to local banks in Fushun to see if they can offer asset financing packages, he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Plus, \"he\" has as much energy at the start of the day as at the end of it - and sometimes even does two consecutive shifts without a wage.\n\nWelcome to the world of a robot co-worker. A company in Denmark, Universal Robots (UR), makes machines that can work alongside human workers on production lines in various industries. And because of their relatively cheap price, they are found in many small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs).\n\nThere have been instances (mainly in Europe) of companies, due to labour shortage, deploying UR robots to replace workers who were on prolonged sick leave.\n\nIndustrial robots are not something new. They have been around for several decades, especially in industries such as automotive and aerospace. However, these have usually been big clumsy machines which require a large operating area sealed off with safety fences to prevent accidental injury.\n\nThanks to miniaturisation of electronic components as well as advances in software programming, companies such as Universal Robots have managed to build robots which are easy to install, safe and require an area of operation that's the size of what a human operator needs.\n\nIn a recent interview with BizIT, Enrico Krog Iversen, CEO of Universal Robots, noted that through a rigorous process of research and development, the company has created lightweight robots which can be mounted on the wall with the same ease as mounting a TV. If required, they can also be shifted from one location to another very easily.\n\n\"This empowers users with the flexibility to maximise the potential of the robots. Unlike previous-generation products, our robots can be taken in and out of production lines with ease without the need to overhaul the floor layout.\n\n\"This is a big boon for manufacturers who require robots to complete one-time tasks for small batches or seasonal production orders. The robots reduce unnecessary costs.\"\n\nUniversal Robots owes it origin to a project started by three young men from the Southern University of Denmark. They were exploring the commercial market for robots with emphasis on the food industry.\n\nThey found that there weren't too many companies using robots, and those that wanted to had to make do with whatever was available in the market. They found that only large companies could afford to deploy industrial robots to automate their production lines.\n\nMr Iversen recalls that in those days, robots were expensive, unsafe, unwieldy and heavy. \"The troika of young engineers was bewildered when they came across a 100kg robot being used to place pepperoni on pizza. So in 2003, they came up with an idea of creating a robot which was light, affordable and easy to install, program and use.\"\n\nUniversal Robots was founded in 2005 with the help of funding from Syddansk Innovation. By 2008, fresh funding was required and that was when Danish venture capital fund V\u00e6kstfonden and Mr Iversen pitched in with more funding.\n\nThe total investment from 2005 to 2008 was around S$2.3 million. Mr Iversen invested in his personal capacity and became one of the majority shareholders. Shortly after, he was appointed Universal Robots' CEO with the primary task of commercialising the product.\n\nAccording to a review done by the National University of Singapore, Universal Robots has experienced substantial growth since the first UR robot entered the market in 2009. It has secured orders from many well-known European brands such as Lear, Oticon, Boch, BMW and Volkswagen. In Asia, it counts companies such as Indian automotive giant Bajaj, and South Korea's LG and Samsung among its customers.\n\nThe review also notes that investing in UR's technology presents good value for manufacturers. Due to the technology used, companies can start to use the robot the day they receive it.\n\nMr Iversen says a significant change that has been ushered in by the company's products is the concept of \"co-bots\" in which humans and robots work side-by-side without the need for expensive fencing (subject to risk assessment) or sacrificing expensive real estate to provide a safe working environment.\n\n\"Our robots are equipped with a state-of-the-art 'stop-force' safety feature. The built-in software generates a protective stop if the robot meets substantial resistance - hugely minimising the occurrence of serious workplace accidents.\"\n\nMr Iversen adds that the robots have found traction in the market because of the ease of use, low installation time and the variety of jobs they can carry out.\n\n\"Having robots that are easy to program and deploy gives manufacturers the edge in today's fast-paced environment, where output must be delivered cost-effectively and manpower is scarce.\n\n\"Far from requiring a background in engineering, our robots can be programmed by shop-floor workers with ease using an intuitive program via a teach pendant which functions like an iPad. Making the set-up and installation user-friendly reduces deployment time, downtime and maximises return on investment.\"\n\nMr Iversen says that, financially, 2013 was a great year for Universal Robots. \"Worldwide, our revenue grew more than 70 per cent year-on-year. We are very bullish about the impact that our products will have in the market . . . We are opening new offices and expanding our distribution network by partnering multiple distributors in more countries and unexplored markets. Globally, we are 100-people strong.\"\n\nHe adds that Asia-Pacific has performed even better than the global average. Business in this region grew more than 400 per cent in 2013 as companies here are starting to become more receptive to the idea of automating their production lines.\n\n\"We are aiming to double our turnover this year in the region,\" he adds.\n\nThe Universal Robots CEO adds that manufacturers in countries such as Japan, Korea, China, Germany and North America have been at the forefront in adopting robotic solutions to automate their factories.\n\n\"However, I believe that we will soon see that manufacturers in countries such as Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore will have a deeper understanding of the benefits and importance of automation in their drive to stay cost-competitive and ensure higher productivity,\" says Mr Iversen.\n\n\"We can expect to see industrial robots moving into the era in which being lightweight and possessing flexible capabilities are the norm.

The changes needed to make products more age-friendly and accessible may not be dramatic, said Kim Walker, chief executive officer of Silver Group, a business consultancy in the 50-plus market.\n\nIt could be modifying the formulation or packaging to suit the changing physical needs of an older body. \"It's not headline news,\" he said. Insight Vacations increased brochure and font sizes for easier reading while Hong Leong Finance equipped its Hong Lim branch with wheelchair-friendly facilities.\n\nIn addition, the silver industry may not be a visible market camp as it does not want to be labelled as such, said Spire Research and Consulting's chief executive officer Leon Perera. He noted that businesses should position their products as age-neutral, as an approach too age-specific will likely fail.\n\nSeniors may not buy items like pureed food or motorised wheelchairs, as some do not like being seen as old and can find it embarrassing, said Mr Perera. Age-specific products like assistive devices and special nutrition should thus be carefully marketed, said Mr Walker.\n\nThen there are age-neutral products which everyone needs. The over-50s still need to wear clothes, wash their hair, be physically active or entertained, said Mr Walker. \"Opportunities for companies are in every single category, to understand what is different about older consumers and make sure all aspects of the business are open, and accommodate to those changes,\" he said.\n\nTargeting seniors in an obvious way will turn away both young and old customers. Businesses should look at attitudes or interests wherever possible to capture both audiences instead of age-segmented marketing, as few seniors want to be reminded of their age.\n\n\"If some people in their 30s like the latest technology, they're likely to remain early adopters later in life,\" said Mr Walker, adding that seniors are more economically stable.\n\nWhile Chan Brothers Travel offers gourmet tours for those seeking gastronomic experiences, Insight Vacations has photography and wine tours. The latter's easy-paced tours were also launched for travellers at large who enjoy a slower pace, but caught up with the seniors.\n\nFitness First Singapore said gym-goers including seniors want a safe and non-intimidating exercise environment with expert support, and what seniors require most is assistance to use the equipment properly. It will thus have all staff from the chief executive down to the front office staff, fitness certified by next year to ensure members have access to professional expertise.\n\nNot all products appeal to everyone, for example, teenage fashion or retirement products. But Mr Walker said unless there is a clear distinction, businesses should not exclude anyone in this demographic climate.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/fujifilm-future-comes-many-hues", "site_title": "For Fujifilm, the future comes in many hues", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nFor Fujifilm, the future comes in many hues\n\nIt has gone into life sciences, healthcare, cosmetics sectors\n\nPublished\n\nMon, Jul 28, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] The story of Japan's Fujifilm - how the company not only survived, but thrived as its once market-leading rival Kodak fell into bankruptcy - is now standard fare for business school case studies.\n\nBut few who knew Fujifilm for rollfilm and its green shopfronts, perhaps, know of how Fujifilm's transformation has led into the realm of medical and life sciences systems, healthcare supplements, and even its own cosmetics line.\n\nTo Hiroyuki Sakai, managing director at Fujifilm Asia Pacific here in Singapore, that story, so closely intertwined with his own 37-year career at Fujifilm, now continues here in Asia.\n\nBack in 2004, he was put in charge of Fujifilm's 4,000 employees-strong wholesale photo finishing business in America. That year, film demand plunged as digital cameras hit the mass-market, and he found himself in a front-row seat to some of the most dramatic and painful changes the company has had to make.\n\n\"Unfortunately, I had to ask many people to go. But it was really necessary. Not just downsizing, but also taking stock of what we had and identifying new areas to invest in for the future,\" he says. Photofilm now contributes less than one per cent of the group's global revenue.\n\nMr Sakai notes that Fujifilm's hunt for new businesses was by no means random. \"Film making is one of the finest chemistries. We had huge assets, technology wise. So we made sure to pick up business areas where we can use our technology assets.\"\n\nThe company now dominates the supply of protective, polarising film to the global LCD panels market. And its expertise in nanotechnology made venturing into the pharmaceuticals sector sensible, says Mr Sakai. But, cosmetics?\n\n\"Many people wonder why Fujifilm is doing cosmetics or skincare. But skin and film have many properties in common, such as collagen,\" he says. Fujifilm's knowledge of how to prevent the oxidation of photographic layers and fading colours has been applied to skin, via its range of anti-ageing skincare products, marketed under the Astalift brand.\n\nNow in its third year in Singapore, Astalift has seen year-on-year growth of about 70 per cent. Mr Sakai deems this encouraging, given that the cosmetic and skincare industry is a tough one to break into.\n\nWhile the company has aggressively diversified its lines of business, home-turf Japan still generates 40 per cent of Fujifilm's sales.\n\nThe company's leadership has thus made it a business priority to speed up global expansion, and raise revenues from overseas markets to 80 per cent.\n\nExpectations for the Asia-Pacific region are high and the pressure is on, Mr Sakai says. \"Now, we're really accelerating, establishing our own subsidiaries in this region.\"\n\nThree years ago, Fujifilm started its own units in Indonesia and Vietnam. In 2012, it also set up a subsidiary in Philippines, while another was set up in Myanmar last year. And Singapore serves as regional headquarters, from which this regional push is orchestrated.\n\nThis also explains why last year, the three separate Fujifilm entities in Singapore merged into one - Fujifilm Asia Pacific. Leaner operations meant a cut in headcount to the current total of about 200 employees at the Tuas factory and its headquarters office.\n\nHowever, growing South-east Asia has also entailed relocating certain business functions out of Singapore. Headquarters for Fujifilm's medical business have been shifted to Bangkok. \"We are supposed to be doing emerging business. However, Singapore is one of the advanced places for the medical business. Also, the market itself for medical business in Thailand is bigger than here,\" says Mr Sakai.\n\nFor similar reasons, the photoimaging business is now headquartered in Malaysia. \"I'm not saying Singapore is not important. Of course, I still keep Singapore as headquarters,\" Mr Sakai says, citing better legal and financial services, better access to the airport and international maritime, as well as a more international labour force as factors in Singapore's favour.\n\nHe adds that lower costs in Thailand and Malaysia were immaterial to these decisions. \"It's more strategic. Costs here are high of course, but taxes are lower here too.\"\n\nMr Sakai is optimistic about the opportunities for Fujifilm in South-east Asia. \"The economy is still growing, it has a young population that is still growing,\" he said.\n\nNot only does this mean greater demand for the chemicals manufacturing, healthcare and other industries it supplies to, it has yielded unexpected bonuses for Fujifilm's consumer-facing photography segments.\n\n\"Polaroid\"-style instant photography has seen a sudden resurgence in popularity among young people in Japan, China, South Korea and South-east Asia. And no matter that, its Instax brand of instant cameras is still not as well known as Polaroid, which went bankrupt in 2001. Instax sales have more than doubled over the last three years, with 2.31 million sold globally in FY2013.\n\n\"An old concept, but a new idea. And it's growing in a big way,\" Mr Sakai says.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

As a result, the group sought shareholders' approval to increase the total fee ceiling for non-executive directors by S$240,000 to S$2.95 million at the AGM. While the previous financial year's aggregate fee ceiling was S$2.71 million, only about S$2.1 million was actually paid out to the non-executive directors.\n\nAt the AGM, which saw a record turnout of more than 800 shareholders yesterday, several of them took issue with both Mr Israel's fee increase and the introduction of shares to his fee package. Two-thirds or S$640,000 of his new fee will be in cash while the remaining third will be in SingTel shares that he is obliged to hold for two years before he is able to sell them.\n\nDavid Chua, a shareholder, called Mr Israel's fee increase \"way overboard\" at the meeting yesterday. \"The chairman is still a non-executive one . . . I think the executive part of the work is normally by the group CEO and the rest of the executive management, and they should be rewarded handsomely, not the board of directors,\" he said.\n\nIn making its case for its chairman\"s fee hike, SingTel had cited his \"significant leadership role\" on the board. It also noted that the board had agreed with Mr Israel that he would commit a \"significant proportion of his time\" to his role as chairman.\n\nSingTel's lead independent director, Kai Nargolwala, told shareholders that in arriving at Mr Israel's fee, comparable benchmarks from other listed firms had been taken into account. These included firms here, in Australia and in Europe. \"The talent for these companies, both management and boards, is drawn globally,\" Mr Nargolwala said.\n\nAnother shareholder, Philip Smith, expressed discomfort at the notion of non-executive directors receiving share awards.\n\n\"I'm personally against non-executive directors getting share awards in all groups because that tints their view. They're not doing the job as professionals anymore, they're sharing in the rewards of the growth of the company,\" Mr Smith said.\n\nMr Nargolwala conceded that there were \"two sides to the argument\" where the matter was concerned, but also noted that: \"There are quite a lot of shareholders in many companies that feel that the board should hold shares.\"\n\nHe added that the shares awarded to Mr Israel do not carry any performance conditions.\n\nOne shareholder, Christopher Cheong, made himself unpopular with several other shareholders after he voiced support for raising Mr Israel's fee. Mr Cheong said that given how the bulk of SingTel's profit came from overseas, good business strategy was important and that the chairman played a critical role in that respect. \"Dear shareholders, considering the importance of business strategy, the (additional) time required of the chairman, and the reasonable increase in director's fee, supporting the resolution, in my opinion, is not only the right thing to to do but also a wise thing to do,\" Mr Cheong concluded.\n\nIn response, another shareholder, KH Tan, archly noted that Mr Cheong's speech appeared to have been prepared in anticipation of objection from fellow shareholders.\n\nEven so, the resolution to increase the directors' fee ceiling was passed with an overwhelming majority, along with all other resolutions tabled at the AGM. All four resolutions at the extraordinary general meeting that followed were also passed.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For the full year ended June 30, net profit fell 32.5 per cent to 509.5 million yuan while revenue eased 10.8 per cent to 2.9 billion yuan.\n\nSignificantly, full-year revenue contribution from the processed business segment fell 20.4 per cent to 1.44 billion yuan. The segment, which contributed 49.6 per cent of China Minzhong's full-year revenue, saw a sharp decline in fresh-packed products which, in light of food inflation and rising labour costs, have become less competitive relative to other South-east Asian countries.\n\nRevenue for the cultivation business segment also recorded a decline, from 1.16 billion yuan to 1.09 billion yuan. This was mainly due to lower selling prices for fresh vegetable produce, but partly offset by increases in mushroom spore sales.\n\nIts branded business segment bucked the trend with a sales increase of 30.2 per cent from 282 million to 367.2 million. This was supported by a 71.2 per cent increase in revenue from the beverage business to 335.5 million yuan. The increased beverage business is largely due to the growth of its domestic distribution channels for branded products, said the company.\n\nOther income increased by 190.6 per cent to 44.4 million yuan, a factor being the increase in interest income from bank deposits of 20.7 million yuan.\n\nNet cash generated from operating activities rose 57.7 per cent to 1.41 billion yuan.\n\nLooking ahead, the global and domestic consumption demand for both fresh vegetables and processed vegetables remains healthy, said the group. It is also experimenting with the use of industrialised farming methodology for other high value crops to capitalise on the rising affluence in China.\n\n\"Our new industrialised farming capacity for champignon mushrooms cultivation at our Tianjin cultivation base has already started contributions and will capitalise on the growing demand in the domestic markets and increase the raw material self-sufficiency for the group's processing needs going forward. The group's new industrialised farming base in Jiangsu province is expected to commence operations by the end of this year,\" said Lin Guo Rong, the group's executive chairman and chief executive officer.\n\nIts counter ended trading unchanged at 83.5 Singapore cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's the second round of layoffs this year after Bombardier postponed the commercial debut of the CSeries, its biggest-ever model, for a fourth time.\n\nEven as Montreal-based Bombardier moves to stem the drain from the new aircraft, the corporate reorganisation deals another blow to fragile bondholder confidence, said Steve Michaels, a money manager at First Western Capital Management.\n\nChief executive officer Pierre Beaudoin bills the CSeries as the centrepiece of Bombardier's growth for the next decade, a model big enough to challenge Boeing Co and Airbus Group, which dominate the single-aisle jet market. That plan has gone unfulfilled, with most major airlines shunning the plane and the first delivery, now set for 2015, more than two years late.\n\nFive-year credit-default protection on Bombardier bonds has surged 40 basis points since July 14, or 0.40 percentage point, to 311 basis points. The contracts reached a 2014 peak of 335 basis points on Jan 29, the most since June 2013, following the disclosure of the latest delay.\n\nMr Michaels said he sold most of his holdings in Bombardier debt last year because yields weren't enough to compensate for rising risks.\n\nWith 203 firm CSeries orders, Bombardier lags behind a goal of about 300 by the time the jet enters service. Guy Hachey, 59, who retired as aerospace CEO last week, said on July 13 the company sticks by a target of \"between US$5 billion and US$8 billion\" a year in CSeries sales \"once we're at full capacity\".\n\nUnder the reorganisation, the aerospace business will be split into three units - business jets, commercial aircraft and aerostructures, the division that makes plane components.\n\n\"They are trying to reduce the number of layers,\" Manish Somaiya, analyst at Citigroup, said. \"The performance in aerospace hasn't been acceptable for a while. Dividing aerospace into three different segments will provide investors with greater transparency.\"\n\nBombardier has been increasingly reliant on bond markets for borrowing as the CSeries' development cost balloons, with the latest projection of US$4.4 billion marking an increase of US$1 billion over the previous forecast.\n\nA bond sale in March raised US$1.8 billion, with Bombardier using US$1.3 billion to pay off existing debt that would have matured in 2016. The company owes bondholders US$7.06 billion, according to first-quarter financial statements.\n\nBorrowing costs implied by Bombardier's bond spreads have increased an average of 39 basis points to 332 basis points since the start of 2014, according to Merrill Lynch indexes. That compares with a 23-basis point narrowing for peers in the US High Yield & Canadian Issuers Index.\n\nBombardier is rated BB- by Standard & Poor's and an equivalent Ba3 by Moody's Investors Service, three levels below investment grade.\n\nInvestors demand an average yield of 332 basis points more than government bonds to hold Bombardier across all maturities, closer to the average of 375 basis points for B-rated borrowers, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Single-B US High Yield Index. Peers in the BB index pay an average spread of 267 basis points, according to the Merrill Lynch data.

The Kuala Lumpur-bound passenger plane was allegedly shot down by the rebels with a Russian-made missile, killing all 298 people on board.\n\nFootball's world governing body Fifa said last Friday that it remained committed to Russia's organisation of the 2018 tournament, arguing that a boycott would not be an effective way of reducing tensions in the region.\n\nThe tournament, Fifa insisted, could be a \"force for good\" - one that serves as a \"powerful catalyst for constructive dialogue between people and governments, uniting teams and nations\".\n\nThat did not stop British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg from declaring that it was \"unthinkable\" for Russia to still be able to host the World Cup if Russian President Vladimir Putin was \"not prepared to play by the basic rules of world affairs\".\n\nMr Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader in the UK, went so far as to suggest that the EU's enhanced package of sanctions against Russia should include sporting events.\n\nBesides the 2018 World Cup, which would be the first to be held in Eastern Europe, he said the Russians should also forfeit the right to host their inaugural Formula One grand prix in October.\n\nIt's worth noting that calls for a boycott are customary whenever Russia hosts a major international sporting event, as was the case earlier this year when Russia's policies against homosexuality received widespread attention up to and during the Winter Olympics in Sochi.\n\nRussia is, of course, no stranger to protests when it comes to sports. No fewer than 64 countries, including the United States and Germany, withdrew from the 1980 Olympic Games to protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nUnderstandably, emotions are still running high in the wake of the MH17 disaster after the airliner was shot down on July 17.\n\nTalk of a boycott or a ban of the World Cup, the Sochi grand prix or any other major event in Russia is premature at this stage, given that investigations into the plane crash are still ongoing.\n\nThe World Cup is still four years away and there is plenty of time for Mr Putin to repair Russia's battered global image.\n\nAfter the spectacle that was the Sochi Olympics, Mr Putin, who enjoys record approval ratings at home and is likely to seek re-election in 2018, will regard the F1 race and the World Cup in Russia as ideal opportunities to cement his legacy and showcase Russia to the world.\n\nAs things stand, Russia is going ahead with plans to spend in excess of US$20 billion to build new stadiums and other infrastructure for the World Cup - nearly double the US$11 billion that Brazil spent to host this year's tournament.\n\nIt must be said, however, that football or any other sport cannot and should not be seen as a solution for all issues, particularly international politics issues. History has shown that sports and politics do not mix well; they never have, and never will.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For example, the conglomerate disclosed details on the process by which it appointed its new chief executive officer (Loh Chin Hua), including the criteria for CEO succession, in its annual report.\n\nLee Boon Yang, Keppel Corp's chairman, said of the recognition: \"Keppel is committed to upholding the highest standard of corporate governance and transparency in the conduct of our business. We believe this is essential for high and sustainable performance. The board and management have a strong sense of accountability towards our stakeholders. We have always aligned the company with the best practices and abided by the Code of Corporate Governance 2012. We are pleased to be ranked as Singapore's most well-governed and transparent company, and for our efforts to be recognised by the business and investing communities.\"\n\nKeppel Corp finished a hair's breadth ahead of SingTel, scoring 116 points to the telco's 115 points in this year's GTI.\n\nSembCorp Industries came in third with 113 points. SGX, last year's winner, chalked up 112 points to come in fourth, despite dropping just one point from last year's score.\n\nGateway services and food solutions provider SATS came into the top five for the first time, bagging 108 points to be ranked fifth. This, after it put in place a fully independent remuneration committee and disclosed the exact remuneration of its executive and non-executive directors.\n\n\"The annual trends and detailed GTI rankings over the last six years show that Singapore-listed companies are making positive strides in reinforcing the values of good corporate governance, risk management and transparency, which are at the core of financial infrastructure and foundation,\" said associate professor Themin Suwardy, Singapore divisional president at CPA Australia. \"While there is room for improvement among listed companies in the broader market, it is clear that well-governed entities create sustainable value for organisations and are trusted by investors big and small.\"\n\nOverall, the study found that the majority of listed companies have embraced the new Code of Corporate Governance, which came into effect in November 2012. For example, more companies disclosed the exact remuneration of both executive and non-executive directors, and more have whistleblowing policies in place and are implementing voting by poll during annual general meetings.\n\nStill, there remains room for improvement. Companies could provide more detailed disclosures on board matters and investor relations; for the 2014 GTI, only 4.4 per cent of companies revealed succession plans, and only 10.4 per cent responded to investor relations queries.\n\nAssociate professor Lawrence Loh, project leader of the GTI at the CGIO, said: \"Current efforts must be sustained to attain higher standards of corporate governance, which are essential to not just safeguarding shareholders' interests, but also protecting the reputation of firms.\"\n\nAt the panel discussion that followed the presentation of the results, the issue of whether small companies could do as well as large companies in sustaining exemplary corporate governance practices was raised. William Liem, CEO of Tuan Sing Holdings, said it depended on a company's resources - of which smaller companies typically have less - and its targets, for example, some companies' shareholders are more focused on its net-profit performance and dividend payout.\n\nIan Macdonald, president of Hong Leong Finance, agreed it was a matter of resources, but added: \"There is one exception - Kenny Yap (of Qian Hu Corp, a relatively small company which regularly scores highly in corporate governance rankings).\"\n\nAssociate professor Mak Yuen Teen, a well-known corporate governance advocate, stoked a discussion on independent directors when he asked the panel if they thought it would be a good idea to have non-controlling shareholders vote on the election/re-election of independent directors, as is the case now in Malaysia and Hong Kong.\n\nLim Ho Seng, chairman of Baker Technology, said the idea was attractive as it would give minority shareholders a greater say in the issue, but that he was not sure about how it would be executed.\n\nIrving Low, head of risk consulting at KPMG in Singapore, said he felt that the state of mind of an independent director - manifested in his actions - was more important than how independent he appeared on paper.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Almost half of the passengers were French citizens, an airline official said.\n\nTwo French fighter jets based in the region have been dispatched to try to locate the airliner along its probable route, a French army spokesman said. Niger security sources said planes were flying over the border region with Mali to search for the flight.\n\nAlgeria's state news agency APS said authorities lost contact with flight AH 5017 an hour after it took off from Burkina Faso, but other officials gave differing accounts of the times of contact, adding to confusion about the plane's fate.\n\nSwiftair, the private Spanish company that owns the plane, confirmed it had lost contact with the MD-83 operated by Air Algerie, which it said was carrying 110 passengers and six crew.\n\nA diplomat in the Malian capital Bamako said that the north of the country - which lies on the plane's likely flight path - was struck by a powerful sandstorm overnight.\n\nWhatever the cause, another plane crash is likely to add to nerves in the industry after a Malaysia Airlines plane was downed over Ukraine last week, a TransAsia Airways crashed off Taiwan during a thunderstorm on Wednesday and airlines cancelled flights into Tel Aviv due to the conflict in Gaza.\n\nAn Air Algerie representative in Burkina Faso, Kara Terki, told a news conference that all the passengers on the plane were in transit, either for Europe, the Middle East or Canada.\n\nHe said the passenger list included 50 French, 24 Burkinabe, eight Lebanese, four Algerians, two from Luxembourg, one Belgian, one Swiss, one Nigerian, one Cameroonian, one Ukrainian and one Romanian. Lebanese officials said there were at least 10 Lebanese citizens on the flight.\n\nA spokeswoman for Sepla, Spain's pilots union, said the six crew were from Spain. She could not give any further details.\n\nAir Algerie's last major accident was in 2003 when one of its planes crashed shortly after take-off from the southern city of Tamanrasset, killing 102 people.

By Jaime Ee\n\nPublished Fri, Jul 25, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nFIRE Dragon Breathing On Beetroot may not be a martial arts fighting stance, but it kind of describes Joshua Skenes - a nod to his kung fu instructor past and his mastery of a primitive cooking form that is key to the painstakingly crafted compositions that land on the tables of his restaurant Saison in San Francisco.\n\nCase in point: the humble beetroot - cooked and suspended for two days over the perpetually glowing embers of the kitchen hearth until dehydrated, then cooked in beetroot juice until it rehydrates and achieves an amazing, intensely-flavoured chewy, gummy bear-like texture. Paired with roasted bone marrow, sour red berries and fir needles, it's a crimson-hued still life on a plate and an epiphany in the mouth.\n\nMind you, it was already dish number 10 in a long evening of highs at a restaurant once dissed for serving pricey US$248 menus but which now offers US$398 Discovery menus without a whisper of dissent. Now that Saison has been named 'the one to watch' at this year's World's 50 Best Awards, it's getting a lot more buzz, not that it affects Chef Skenes in any way. Instead, he's much more interested in perfecting his craft and sourcing the best ingredients, whether it's vegetables grown on the restaurant's own farm, or fish and abalone caught and harvested specially for them.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/editioned-artworks-buy-or-not-buy", "site_title": "Editioned artworks: To buy or not to buy?", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nEditioned artworks: To buy or not to buy?\n\nHelmi Yusof\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Jul 24, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nARE editioned works a good investment? According to some gallerists here, editioned works - or artworks that appear in multiples, such as prints - are not popular among Asian collectors because they're perceived to be less valuable and exclusive than paintings, which are typically one-off or unique. In other words, that Murakami print that comes in an edition of 300 that you paid US$2,600 for could one day be hanging in 299 other homes.\n\nHowever, a lively and informative panel discussion at the recent Edition(ed) art fair organised by Art Galleries Association Singapore reveals that those attitudes may be changing here.\n\nThe knowledgeable panel comprised founder and CEO of online gallery The Artling, Talenia Phua Gajardo; chief printer of artspace STPI, Eitaro Ogawa; art historian Louis Ho; and artist Belinda Fox. The discussion held at Helutrans was moderated by Benjamin Hampe, director and co-owner of Chan Hampe Galleries.\n\nSome panel members noted that editioned works are more popular in the West where it's common to purchase at more pocket-friendly prices a signed and editioned print of an artwork by a famous artist, whose original artworks would cost much more than what most collectors can afford. These prints can appear in editions as small as two and as large as 500 or more.\n\nIn recent times, however, the editioned work has taken a life of its own. Auction house Sotheby's and Christie's now hold auctions exclusively of prints. Last year, Christie's sold a Picasso print for US$251,179, a Kirchner print for US$270,271 and a Bacon print for US$107,989. Of course, these figures are still a fraction of what an original painting by these artists would go for.\n\nBut flip through any recent auction catalogue of Asian art and you'll find very few - if any - prints by Asian artists for sale. If there are, they are likely to be those of Murakami, Kusama, Nara or Walasse Ting.\n\nYet, at the Edition(ed) art fair, the 70 works by 30 artists from Singapore and abroad were selling from as low as S$1,000 to as high as S$82,000 - a sum that could have gotten you a unique artwork or two by a top contemporary Asian artist. In the case of photography, the works typically come in editions. But in the case of paintings, should you risk buying a reproduction of the work on paper, notoriously hard to preserve in Singapore's weather?\n\nAccording to Ms Phua Gajardo, the secondary market for prints is not as active in Asia as it is in the West. But she predicts that that \"will change with time\". Notably, she and Mr Hampe both think that art buyers here are more concerned about the quality of the image, the reputation of the artist, and the price of the work - rather than whether the work is unique or editioned.\n\nBoth feel that collecting editioned works is a good way to start for collectors with less deep pockets. Whether the work can fetch a higher value - or any value - in the secondary market afterwards depends, not unpredictably, on the reputation of the artist.\n\nMs Phua Gajardo had this advice to give when buying prints, though. She says: \"At The Artling, buyers often want to know how large the edition size is, and what's the edition number of the work we're selling (say, edition number 7 of 15, or 135 of 500).\"\n\n\"But if current auction records are any indication, the edition number shouldn't matter. At a recent auction, a Francis Bacon print, out of an edition of 150, sold for US$80,000.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There are some very stunning wines which we're happy to taste.\"\n\nMr Fedkiw, agreeing, added that certain Old World wines had surprised the judges with their outstanding quality.\n\nA new category for the Wine Challenge this year - added in response to feedback last year - features dessert wines. Mr Lim said that the quality of the submissions vindicated the decision to add this category to the challenge. \"What stood out in the dessert wines were the freshness and cleanness of the wines. We did not find fault with any of the dessert wines. They were clean, well-made and of high quality. And because of that, we really had to be very stringent with our selection.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

More than the required 80 per cent of owners have consented to the collective sale.\n\nThe gross plot ratio is 1.05, and its gross floor area (GFA) is 43,300 sq ft. If the GFA of the redevelopment exceeds this, development charges will be payable. Based on the Urban Redevelopment Authority's typical plot size for a terrace unit, developers can build up to 25 strata terrace units; they may also go for any alternative combination of detached, semi-detached and terrace units.\n\nKheam Hock Gardens is within walking distance of Botanic Gardens MRT Station on the Circle Line. Accessibility to the Marina Bay central business district area will improve when the station is extended to become part of the Downtown Line as well.\n\nThe site is a three to five-minute drive away from the Pan Island Expressway, Dunearn Road and Bukit Timah Road. Tucked within a private residential enclave, Kheam Hock Gardens sits amid lush greenery, said CBRE, the sole marketing agent.\n\nCBRE's director of investment properties Galven Tan said: \"The natural topography allows a developer the flexibility in designing a development that will take advantage of this tranquil and lush environment.\"\n\nHe added that with the \"very manageable\" development size, he expected keen interest from developers.\n\nThe tender for Kheam Hock Gardens closes on Sept 15.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But Singaporeans should not grow complacent about price pressures.\n\nThe monthly inflation rate has been tame this year, far from the alarming 4-5 per cent levels of the last three years. On Wednesday, the government said inflation in June fell to 1.8 per cent. This was a sharper drop from May's 2.7 per cent than economists were expecting. But calmer headline inflation figures - thanks largely to stabilising vehicle certificate of entitlement (COE) premiums and home prices - must not mask the impact of rising prices on households, especially lower-income ones.\n\nThe official figures also show that inflation hit the poorest 20 per cent of households hardest - at 2.1 per cent over the first half of 2014. The Department of Statistics points out that imputed rentals on the homes people own and live in (a component of the consumer price index) weigh more in the lowest-income group's consumption basket, but are not out-of-pocket expenses. This does explain the figures for 2012 and 2013: once imputed rentals were excluded, the poorest faced a lower inflation rate than middle- and high-income households did in both years. But in the first half of this year, after excluding imputed rentals, the poorest fifth of households continued to experience the highest inflation rate of 2.0 per cent - compared to 1.7 per cent for the middle- and high-income groups.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This included a charity auction at which it raised S$1.08 million (including the government's dollar-for-dollar matching grant) to increase the number of recipients in its Temasek Polytechnic and Institute of Technical Education (ITE) scholarship programmes.\n\nWith the donation money, the group wanted to expand the scholarship programmes - hence the LAwards, an annual inter-institution culinary challenge, at Singapore Hotel and Tourism Education Centre (SHATEC) Institutes.\n\nTo be officially launched in August, the Culinary Challenge is the brainchild of Les Amis chairman Desmond Lim and was created with the goal of sparking interest in the culinary profession, to grow the pool of young local talent that will join the F&B industry.\n\nThe Challenge will see budding chefs from local cooking schools competing for a prize of S$3,000 cash and the ultimate sweetener: an all-expenses-paid \"10 Michelin Stars\" trip to Japan or Europe to dine at top-rated restaurants.\n\nBut first they have to impress a judging panel comprising Mr Lim, quasi-professional chef Melina Yong, Singapore Chefs Association VP Eric Neo, Tetsuya and Waku Ghin chef-owner Tetsuya Wakuda and Singapore Tourism Board executive director John Gregory Conceicao.\n\nThat's not all Les Amis has in store for the industry. The LAwards challenge is part of the group's new career initiative, LEAPFROG, that it rolled out in March as well.\n\n\"LEAPFROG is inspired by the idea of progressing by leaps and bounds, overcoming obstacles and constantly jumping ahead. This is exactly the experience that the Les Amis Group offers to promising talents who are ready to step up,\" says Mr Lim in a statement.\n\n\"With the current manpower crunch, many schools provide a very sustainable source of manpower for the F&B industry. So it's only natural that we work together with the schools,\" adds group director Raymond Lim. Even so, it hasn't been easy, as \"it's a relatively new idea\".\n\nIt's still too early to tell how many such graduates will eventually take up jobs in the Les Amis group, \"but we've seen a steady increase and it's slowly starting to bear fruit\".\n\nBesides Les Amis, Deliciae Hospitality Management Pte Ltd is another group working on similar projects. CEO Olivier Bendel says Deliciae has started collaborating with School of Hotel and Resort Management this year, to recruit students as trainees in the kitchen and service sectors.\n\nMr Bendel said: \"Les Amis Group has always been one of the big players in the food and beverage industry in Singapore, and once again, they have come up with a unique concept such as this.\n\n\"Typically, the F&B sector portrays an image of hard labour and long hours. We need to turn this around and show young Singaporeans that it can be a glamorous industry that offers fantastic career opportunities.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Earlier this month, the menswear heavyweight announced the acquisition of a majority stake in an Australian superfine wool farm Achill, where merino wool sheep are raised.\n\n\"The opportunity to better understand the daily work of the graziers, sharing the culture and the philosophy of quality and the technical side of this magnificent fibre is quite exciting,\" explains Paolo Zegna, chairman of the Ermenegildo Zegna Group. \"By supporting the work of a young, talented farmer, we have a unique and sizeable opportunity to faithfully look at the future of an industry which we want to preserve and protect for future generations.\"\n\nToday, the Zegna Group treats and consumes 1.5 million kg per year of the highest grade wool available. With over 500 standalone boutiques around the world, the fourth-generation family business also produces suits for brands such as Gucci and Tom Ford, and is one of the biggest producers of luxury fabrics in the world. To maintain its demand for ultra-fine wool fabrics, company reps explored the idea of being in the business of producing the raw material during a trip to Sydney. Inking the deal with the family-owned wool farming company then officially completed the brand's supply chain.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Using no words and few props, Meyyappan and his actors rely on literal, mimetic and symbolic gestures to conjure complex, layered stories. At times, his masterful storytelling is more effective than an ordinary play with words.\n\nHowever, just as one may be awestruck by the guilelessness of his storytelling, one may also be perplexed by the stories' naivete that feels anachronistic in this day and age.\n\nIn Butterfly, his latest play for the Esplanade Studios series, Meyyappan has created the tale of a beautiful and innocent woman whose life is torn asunder when two men fall for her. Set sometime in the 1920s in Scotland, the tale largely takes place in a shop where the gentle and unassuming Butterfly (Ashley Smith) makes and sells kites.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

DYLAN TAN reports\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Jul 24, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSINGAPORE might not have a Harry Potter or Twilight in the making yet but the gap between the local literary and film scene is closing with the return of Utter, the annual Singapore Writers Festival initiative where homegrown literature is brought to life through other art mediums like theatre or film.\n\nAdaptations of local books have been few and far between through the decades though there are a handful of notable ones including Army Daze, Michael Chiang's rib-tickling National Service tale that was turned into a movie in 1996 and resurrected on stage numerous times since it became a play in 1987; and The Teenage Textbook, Adrian Tan's coming-of-age novel that made it to the big screen in 1998.\n\nOther efforts include AlterAsians, a series of TV movies based on the works of local writers such as Colin Cheong, KK Seet and Simon Tay that were dramatised by filmmaker Lee Thean-Jeen for TV12 (now okto).\n\nSince 2011, the Singapore Writers Festival has introduced Utter, a pre-festival programme to extend the reach of works of local writers by getting other arts practitioners to adapt them into either theatre productions or films.\n\nGetting the word out there\n\nThe aim is not only to target a new audience who might not previously be familiar with the literary scene but also for readers to gain a deeper appreciation for the work through a new art form.\n\nFor the second year running, the cinematic treatment has been chosen though producer Nicholas Chee of Sinema Media, a consultancy and project management company that has been championing Made-in-Singapore films for years, says a different approach has been used for Utter 2014. Each short film, for instance, will be made in one of Singapore's four official languages with the directors from their respective races helming it \"for authenticity\".\n\nThe four titles are Wee Li Lin's That Loving Feeling, based on Homecoming by the late Gopal Baratham; Sanif Olek's Tin Kosong, based on the story of the same name by Muhammad Salihin Sulaiman; Don Aravind's At Your Doorstep, based on Peaks by Kamaladevi Aravindhan; and Kenny Tan's Going Home, based on the short story of the same name by Lin Jin.\n\nFor maximum big-screen impact, Chee (who counts himself as a big fan of local literature since young) has insisted the screenings be held in a real cinema hall.\n\nThe 35-year-old adds that besides using Utter as a platform for the next generation of local filmmakers - Olek, for instance, has been winning rave reviews and awards on the international festival circuit with his debut feature film, Sayang Disayang - the project is also important because of the opportunities for trans-medium cross-pollination between various storytelling forms; especially with the wealth of ready-written local stories for directors to tap.\n\n\"It should become a norm for directors looking to make new short films (and) schools should do this,\" he says.\n\nAs Wee puts it: \"It can be a very lonely process when you're trying to come up with your own story because you don't know who's going to like it or not. (Adapting) gives you a certain anchor point and somewhere to root.\"\n\nYet it might come as a surprise that for many of the filmmakers, working on their projects for Utter 2014 marked the first time they were not directing their own material. This is mainly because directors, like writers, generally tend to see themselves as storytellers too and hence may give priority to their own works.\n\nNot only that, some books are also difficult to adapt for various reasons. Olek cites Peter Jackson's comment that he would need more than four hours if he wanted to squeeze everything from The Lord of the Rings into his movie as one challenge of trying to bring something from print to screen faithfully.\n\nLikewise, Wee notes that Forrest Gump the movie was very different from the book, which felt more episodic; and the most common complaint about big-screen adaptions is the film being unable to capture the essence of the book.\n\nOlek adds that some classic Malay texts are also difficult to bring to life on screen because the language tends to be very refined and sounds unnatural as movie dialogue. \"I don't want to make a film where my characters are (silent and) just staring into space all the time like Wong Kar Wai,\" he jokes.\n\nAravind reasons that \"film and literature have their own language\", so adapting dialogue from a book for a movie isn't as straightforward as just lifting it straight off the page.\n\nTan adds there is the fear of messing up the original author's vision. \"The writers from the literary world are a different breed. So even screenwriters get stressed about converting their work into a screenplay,\" notes the 32-year-old. \"But it's not always fair to compare both - instead they should be viewed as companions because you get to see the world of a book through the film.\"\n\nThankfully, some of the pressure has been taken off the directors because they were given full creative control and freedom with their adaptations - though everybody made an effort to be respectful towards the original texts.\n\nNone has spoken to the authors since completing their movies and the writers will be viewing the finished product for the first time together with the public when Utter 2014 kicks off next week.\n\nThe key is picking elements of the text that would translate well cinematically - such as the square dance sequence in Wee's The Look of Love. Hokkien features in Tan's Going Home because he felt it would be more natural for two old men to be conversing in that dialect even though the book's dialogue was originally in Mandarin.\n\nLoving the language\n\nBut more than anything, being involved in Utter 2014 turned into a chance for the filmmakers to discover the literary scene - and their own roots - after mostly losing touch with it through the years.\n\nTan admits even though Chinese is his mother tongue, he often feels intimidated by books in that language because he lacks the confidence to be able to read it from cover to cover and understand it. Yet the freelance director surprised himself by finishing The Starry Night Still Sparkles: Selected Works of Flash Fiction of Singapore, from which Lin Jin's (Lim Boon Gim) Going Home was culled: and he even got his mother hooked on it.\n\nAravind claims the experience has even reignited his love for his mother tongue. \"I didn't do well in Tamil and would never read a Tamil book (before) but all that has changed,\" says the 31-year-old. \"I love it more than ever now.\"\n\ndylantan@sph.com.sg\n\n@DylanTanSYBT\n\n'Utter' will take place at GV VivoCity on July 30 at 7pm-9pm, Aug 3 at 4pm-6pm, and Aug 6 at 7pm-9pm.

Year-on-year, prices rose 3.9 per cent in Q2, slower than the average increase of 18.8 per cent annually over the past four years.\n\nRentals have stabilised, dipping by 0.1 per cent in Q2, after registering a slight 0.4 per cent growth in Q1.\n\nYear-on-year, they rose 5 per cent, still slower than the average 10.2 per cent increase annually over the past four years.\n\nThe increase in industrial prices in Q2 was partly driven by multiple-user factory space, whose prices rose by 2.5 per cent because a larger proportion of those transacted in the quarter were freehold properties compared to Q1.\n\nThis led several analysts to flag problems with JTC's price index which does not distinguish between different lengths of tenures. This may pose problems in future as industrial land tenures have been capped at 30 years, down from up to 60 years before, and shorter-tenure spaces tend to have lower selling prices.\n\nSavills Singapore research head Alan Cheong said: \"The index is still not satisfactory. We have to wait until JTC starts stratifying the index according to tenure and backtrack it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, industrial occupancy rates fell for a third consecutive quarter by 0.9 percentage points to a seven-year low of 90.7 per cent from Q1.\n\nYear-on-year, they were also down by 1.7 percentage points, from 92.4 per cent a year ago.\n\nThis came as industrial space released exceeded the rise in occupied stock during the quarter, which will likely continue. In the second half of this year, about 1.8 million sqm of space is estimated to come onstream.\n\nAfter that, between 2015 and 2017, an average of around 1.6 million sq m of industrial space will come on every year, representing 3-4 per cent of the current available stock. It is also higher than the average annual supply of 1.3 million sqm and demand of 900,000 sqm over the past three years.\n\nChia Siew Chuin, director of research and advisory at Colliers, said the dip in occupancies of multiple-user factories to 87.3 per cent in Q2 - itself also a seven-year low - is cause for concern.\n\nThis happened because completed redevelopment projects in the private sector, from the red-hot 2010-2012 period when developers were plunging headlong into building strata-titled factories to feed speculators' appetite, have started coming onto the market, she said.\n\nThe government has since moved to clamp down on their permissible uses. \"Now landlords, agents, occupiers want to be careful not to flout the regulations, so they go through a more stringent and lengthy process, which affects the lead time to a successful deal and eventual occupancy.\"\n\nJTC's recent moves to limit the amount of space that can be sub-let may lead to similar caution and stringent checking processes for JTC premises and properties on JTC land, she added.\n\nSavills' Mr Cheong believes that occupancy rates are more reflective of the state of the market, over rentals.\n\nThis is because a lot of vacancies are coming from some \"speculative grade factories\" boasting manufacturing-unrelated \"extras\" like air-con ledges, planter boxes, high ceilings and private enclosed spaces and which ask for rents north of S$3 psf. Most conventional spaces do not charge above S$2 psf.\n\nThe rental index, however, does not reflect their higher asking rents because transactions are not being closed at those prices, he said. He expects vacancy rates to further widen to double digits.\n\nAs more supply comes onstream, it will be the \"run-of-the-mill\" multi-tenant light industrial factories, properties without a strong positioning, or shorter-tenure factories that will suffer as there is already an ample supply of them in the market, analysts say.\n\nBut prices for buildings with better locations or specifications or with longer tenures will likely hold up better due to their scarcity.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And overlooked architectural gems? At this point, surely nothing in the Bay Area has been overlooked.\n\nBut every now and then the impossible happens. And so it was in the autumn of 2011, when Charles DeLisle and Ralph Dennis stumbled upon a listing for a home in Mill Valley on Craigslist. The language was somewhat vague: \"unique architect's house\", it read. Still, it was worth a look.\n\n\"We came up the hill, went up the stairs, walked into this glass-and-cedar house with 180-degree views of Oakland,\" Mr DeLisle recalled, \"and got really excited.\" And not just about the views. The house, it turned out, had been built in 1951 by Donn Emmons, a highly regarded midcentury architect, for his young family. A 1,200 sq ft, two-story cedar structure, it had a ship's ladder instead of a staircase and a facade that was almost entirely glass, to take advantage of the views. It was still owned by the Emmons family, so it was in its original state.\n\nSure, that meant it had drafty old doors and a less-than-stellar heating system, but the rent was US$2,800, significantly less than the going rate for most two-bedroom houses in the area - and exactly what the pair had been paying for their much smaller apartment in the city, which they shared with two big dogs.\n\nThere was just one problem: Someone else got there first.\n\nNevertheless, Mr DeLisle, who is now 46, and Mr Dennis, 41, refused to be deterred. The couple, who have been together for 11 years and married for six, are both designers: Mr Dennis is the design director for Steven Volpe Design, an interiors firm in San Francisco, and Mr DeLisle has his own furniture and interior design firm. More importantly, they are big midcentury architecture buffs; their previous house was an Eichler, one of the affordable modernist homes built in the postwar years by the visionary developer Joseph Eichler. That had to count for something.\n\nSo Mr DeLisle drafted a letter to the Emmons children. \"I explained that we had both worked on modern houses - a William Wurster, a Richard Neutra, a Joseph Esherick - and that we used to live in an Eichler house,\" he said. \"And that if we were to build a house, this is what we would build.\" They got the lease.\n\nFurnishing the house presented a different sort of challenge. The couple set about furnishing it in what seemed like an \"organic\" way, with a mix of things belonging to Mr Delisle, who is the \"more obsessive collector,\" he admitted. But \"most things go through Ralph's eye,\" he said. \"Otherwise it would look like we lived at a yard sale.\" - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

Set in LA's decadent Sunset Strip in the 1980s, the jukebox musical features classic songs from popular heavy metal bands of that period like Bon Jovi, Poison, Europe and Twisted Sister.\n\nPlot-wise, it traces the journey of a small-town girl who falls in love with an aspiring musician but gets carried away by the bright lights after a big-city rocker sweeps her off her feet.\n\nThe show made its debut on stage in 2006 before it was adapted into a movie starring Hollywood hunk Tom Cruise and British comedian Russell Brand in 2012. It is currently the 30th longest-running production on Broadway with over 2,000 performances and counting - on top of numerous other touring versions playing every night all over the world, including one onboard a cruise liner.\n\n\"The music speaks for itself - everybody loves hearing the hits of the Eighties,\" says Rock of Ages' assistant director Matthew DiCarlo, of the show's popularity. He has been working on it since its off-Broadway debut.\n\n\"Rock of Ages shifts a bit with each company that performs it - the story and the songs remain the same but the show itself is always reinvented with each new company. It has been thrilling to hear so many different performers interpret the iconic music over the last six years,\" he adds.\n\nDiCarlo is not the show's only long-timer as lead actor Dominique Scott has been playing the character Drew, the budding musician, for the past three years.\n\nAs a real-life rocker, he found the role almost tailor-made for him. \"We share almost every single trait,\" he says, \"In fact, I don't think there is a character that I am more like in real life in the entire musical theatre repertoire. Drew is a young kid with rock-star qualities who gets to live out, to some degree, his rock-star dreams in the show - (and) getting to do that every night is exhilarating.\"\n\nHis co-star Shannon Mullen (who plays Sherrie, the wide-eyed girl who comes to LA) shares that the best thing about her role is getting her hair crimped and wearing fishnets every night onstage. \"I definitely connect with Sherrie and her dreamier side,\" adds the child of the '80s. \"(We are) always optimistic and look at the world with excitement (but) I can't say I'm quite as naive as (Sherrie); we have our faults.\"\n\nWorking on a heavy metal musical, it's only natural for the cast and crew to have their own rock-star moments. For DiCarlo, he admits to occasionally letting his hair down at the karaoke while belting out Def Leppard's Pour Some Sugar On Me, while Scott has a slightly wilder tale.\n\n\"People get so excited when they see me perform that they sometimes feel compelled to throw their panties at me onstage in a moment of heated passion,\" he says.\n\n\"I have kept every article of clothing that's ever been thrown at me onstage and made a wall with them in my recording studio where all the trophies of love now hang,\" Scott adds. \"This is a true story - I'm not kidding.\"\n\nAnybody who needs more proof that the actors rock the stage like they mean it only need to ask Mullen about her most unforgettable show. \"My wig fell off once - it was definitely one to remember,\" she recalls. \"But let it be a note of how much headbanging we do!\"\n\ndylantan@sph.com.sg\n\n@DylanTanSYBT\n\n'Rock of Ages' runs from Aug 6-24 at Resorts World Theatre at Resorts World Sentosa.

This has been made possible in part by earlier detection of heart disease through the use of various technologies to scan the heart.\n\nScans of the heart can broadly be divided into those with and those without X-ray radiation. If the heart scan is done for a good reason and the centre has a proven track record for accuracy and uses low dose X-ray radiation, the potential benefits from the medical information obtained from the scan will far outweigh any theoretical risk resulting from the exposure to X-ray radiation.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The characters she inhabits, whether in comic sketches on Saturday Night Live or fully-formed personas in feature films, often walk the delicate line between real and imagined worlds, between sad and funny. It's a place she seems comfortable in.\n\nIn Hateship Loveship, a film adapted from a short story by Alice Munro with a screenplay by Mark Poirier and directed by Liza Johnson, Wiig is wholly convincing as Johanna Parry, a plain-looking yet practical-minded and hard-working housekeeper. There is a grim determination about everything Johanna does, whether it's scrubbing the kitchen floor, shopping for groceries or dressing a just-deceased old woman in a favourite dress.\n\nThere is a deep neediness about her as well, a condition brought about by her lonely, love-starved existence. She has devoted her life to caring for others but she's also a woman alone and in search of emotional well-being.\n\nAnd so the situation is ripe for exploitation when Johanna shows up in a small Iowa town, ready to take on a new job that requires her to look after Mr McCauley (Nick Nolte), a crusty widower with a teenaged granddaughter Sabitha (Hailee Steinfeld) and a built-in distrust of Sabitha's deadbeat dad Ken (Guy Pearce), whose drug-taking and drink-driving was responsible for the accident that killed his wife. \"He couldn't run a one-pump gas station,\" says McCauley dismissively of his son-in-law.\n\nJohanna's arrival stirs up curiosity among the local townsfolk and also between Sabitha and her best pal Edith (Sami Gayle), who devises a cruel trick by misleading Johanna into thinking that Ken - who lives in Chicago where he has a vague plan to renovate a run-down motel - has a romantic interest in her. The girls send mushy emails from \"Ken\" to Johanna, who is completely taken in by the ruse. In one sad, startling scene, Johanna's desire gets the better of her as she imagines herself locking lips with Ken, kissing the bathroom mirror with undisguised passion.\n\nJohanna is nothing if not stubbornly resolute and she heads for a rendezvous in Chicago with Ken, a first-class loser whose drug-addled girlfriend Chloe (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is no match for her - and neither is Ken. Johanna has found her man - whether he knows it or not - and she's clinging on for dear life. Her mission has been to take care of people who can't take care of themselves but this time around, there's plenty of self-interest at stake.\n\nHateship Loveship is an intense, slow-moving and quietly humorous drama, filmed with care and filled with interesting detail. The story hums with Johanna at its heart but the narrative is also uneven at times and the movie never really takes flight. This is a classic character study of a restrained, unsmiling and not unattractive woman. As interpreted by Wiig, that's more than enough to hold our attention.\n\nRating:\n\nB-\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This year, DFF will run from Sept 5 to 14, at Shaw Theatres Lido. This is the fourth edition of the festival, since it began in 2010. It skipped a year in 2012.\n\nFestival producer Germaine Chong says there was nothing like DFF when it was started. \"We wanted to create an event that even non-designers could participate in. We learnt that non-designers are interested in design, but are intimidated by it.\"\n\nShe adds: \"Film was chosen as a medium that could be accessible to everyone, hence a film festival.\"\n\nMs Chong is also the co-founder of Anonymous, a multidisciplinary studio that provides creative direction, content and design. The firm is also the organiser for DFF.\n\nThis year's edition marks several firsts for the festival. Among them - a festival theme. On a Scale of Art to Design, is this year's theme, derived from an observation of the blurring boundaries between art and design.\n\nMs Chong says: \"In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to maintain a clear distinction between art and design with many designers creating art and many artists applying design in their works.\"\n\nThis year's selection of works include a few films where the content addresses the blurred boundaries.\n\nThey include Obey The Artist, a 14-minute short film on street artist, graphic designer and activist Shepard Fairey bringing a 12-foot mural to life, and Larger Than Life, a film on Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman, of the giant rubber ducky fame, who is popular with the general public but lacks recognition in the art world.\n\nJapanese foodies will not want to miss the festival's opening film, Hakusho: The Story of Rice, which takes audiences from the rice fields where the food staple is planted to its harvesting stages. The film's director Yu Yamanaka will also be present to introduce the film. DFF marks the world premiere for Hakusho.\n\nThe makers' movement which is fast growing in Singapore, will also be seen on screen, through the film Maker, which delves into the emerging ecosystem of design and manufacturing, and looks at how the community is subverting traditional manufacturing in the Internet age.\n\nFor the first time, there will be limited edition T-shirts for sale at S$55 each. Seven international designers have been invited to design the T-shirts.\n\nAnd if you miss the festival, don't fret. Between September and December, a selection of present and past festival films will be screened on Singapore Airlines flights.\n\n'A Design Film Festival 2014' is on from Sept 5 to 14, at Shaw Theatres Lido. Tickets are priced at S$15 each for all screenings, S$25 for the opening film, and are available at\n\nwww.designfilmfestival.com\n\n, which will go live from tomorrow at 7 pm.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Released domestically in Taiwan last year, the rom-com has toured the global festival circuit heavily since, playing everywhere from Udine, Italy to Hawaii, Bangkok and Buenos Aires.\n\nThe plot, which revolves around the relationship between a feisty Mainlander and her mild-mannered Taiwanese male host, is inspired by Hsieh's own real-life friendship with a Chinese schoolmate, Gu Qiao, during his university days in New York.

The harp is reportedly the longest stringed instrument in the world, with strings that stretch up to 300m in length.

Despite these two former prime ministers of Singapore and Malaysia in his publishing stable, thus having a hand in both countries' political histories, the late Donald Moore should also be known for his key contribution to Singapore arts and culture.\n\nBut few know his name. And fewer still realise that Mr Moore was a key player in developing Singapore's arts scene in post-war Singapore - with businesses that provided the foundation for the cultural landscape for both Singapore and Malaya, from 1947 until 1976.\n\nAn exhibition opening at The Arts House next month will throw the spotlight on this Renaissance man who has unfortunately been largely forgotten in Singapore and Malayan history.\n\nUnder the imprint Donald Moore Press, Mr Moore wrote and published many books on Singapore, including Alex Josey's Lee Kuan Yew: The Critical Years, Dr Mahathir's The Malay Dilemma and The First 150 Years of Singapore, a book he co-wrote with his wife Joanna.\n\nAs an arts lover and impresario, Mr Moore also produced three plays before the end of the 1950s for The Little Theatre and eventually went on to establish Singapore Arts Theatre, with hopes that it would become a national theatre for the people.\n\n\"We were intrigued by this figure, and thought that someone should excavate more information about him, and accord him a proper place in Singapore history,\" says William Phuan, director of The Arts House.\n\nAfter being approached by publisher Goh Eck Kheng about Mr Moore, The Arts House decided to curate the exhibition and also conduct research to flesh out more details of his works.\n\n(Re)Discovering Donald Moore: Singapore's Art Pioneer is a major retrospective dedicated to his multi-faceted life and career. It includes items from Donald Moore Galleries, a lifestyle-concept store owned by Mr Moore and his wife.\n\nThere are some 80 artefacts on display, comprising books that he published and programme leaflets that he designed for the shows that he brought in, such as a Martha Graham performance, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and the legendary Mohammad Ali - for his five-round exhibition at the National Stadium in 1973.\n\n\"The final act he brought in was a circus act from Spain, which unfortunately did so badly that he went bankrupt and left Singapore after he wound up his companies,\" relates Mr Phuan, who said that The Arts House worked on the exhibition for about a year as they gathered personal recollections from Mr Moore's children and other people who knew him. Mr Moore died in 2000.\n\nThe most challenging part of the exhibition was tying all the pieces together and showing the scope of Mr Moore's interests and work. \"We wanted to give a comprehensive sense of what he had done and accomplished in Singapore,\" he adds.\n\nMr Goh, who first mooted the idea of the exhibition, says that his interest stemmed from two personal angles. His father worked for Mr Moore in his publishing house, and Mr Goh later also became an avid collector of Singapore books.\n\nMr Goh, along with members of the advisory committee which includes Lai Chee Kien, Tan Dan Feng, Robert Yeo and Verner Bickley, will loan books and artefacts from their collections. The Singapore audience will be pleasantly surprised by a couple of things from the exhibition, he thinks. The main takeaway would be how there was so much going on in arts and culture at that time - so Singapore wasn't a \"cultural desert\" which is a common misconception - and that it was the result of one man's passion for the arts.\n\n\"He did it all for the love of Singapore as well, and wanted to bring arts and culture to the island.\"\n\nuihoon@sph.com.sg\n\n(Re)discovering Donald Moore: Singapore's Art Pioneer will be held from Aug 7- 29 at the Blue Room and the Print and Film Gallery, The Arts House, from 10am to 8pm daily. Admission is free. For more details, please go to\n\nwww.theartshouse.com.sg\n\n. On Aug 7, at 7.30pm, there will be a panel discussion with Mr Moore's children and his associates in Singapore about his legacy here\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This translates to an annualised distribution yield of 6.6 per cent based on the unit price of S$1.58 on July 23.\n\nIncreased shopper traffic and tenant sales suggest that recent concerns over the impact of e-commerce in China are overblown, CRCT chief executive Tony Tan said yesterday.\n\nThe retail operator in China remains open to expanding its portfolio, which is worth 10.4 billion yuan (S$2.1 billion) as at June 30, by acquiring malls from its sponsor CapitaLand or external third parties, he told analysts and reporters. \"But the asking price remains sticky on the upside,\" Mr Tan said, adding that there are not many distressed assets for the picking in China.\n\nIn the second quarter, CRCT racked in a 29.5 per cent growth in net property income to S$34.2 million and its distributable income grew 18.7 per cent to S$21.3 million from a year ago, thanks to the new contribution from CapitaMall Grand Canyon and stronger revenue from the reopened CapitaMall Minzhongleyuan.\n\nCRCT's portfolio enjoyed a 5.5 per cent year-on-year increase in shopper traffic in the second quarter and a 13.6 per cent growth in tenant sales. Rental reversion hit a robust 24.9 per cent in the second quarter, up from 23 per cent in the first quarter and 17.3 per cent in the second quarter of last year.\n\nCapitaMall Xizhimen and CapitaMall Wangjing in Beijing achieved rental reversions of 19.1 per cent and 23.9 per cent respectively during the quarter. CRCT chalked in higher gross rents at CapitaMall Xizhimen, CapitaMall Wangjing and CapitaMall Saihan in Inner Mongolia after improving their tenant mix.\n\nWith the exception of CapitaMall Wuhu, CRCT's multi-tenanted malls are above 90 per cent occupied as at June 30. Mr Tan said that CapitaMall Wuhu, which is now 89.3 per cent full, is expected to take another one to two years to stabilise.\n\nFor the first half, CRCT's net property income grew 27.3 per cent to S$66.6 million, while distributable income rose 16 per cent to S$40.9 million from the year-ago period. Its DPU for the first half was 4.99 Singapore cents, up from 4.69 Singapore cents in first half 2013.\n\nThe ground sentiment in China, according to Mr Tan, is not as gloomy as what some industry players have painted - some shopping mall operators are consolidating while others are still expanding or merely relocating. A severe oversupply situation is not happening in places where CRCT's malls are located, he said.\n\nAccording to reports from Colliers International and Jones Lang LaSalle, four new shopping malls in Beijing with a combined gross floor area of 388,000 square metres are slated to be completed by end-2014 in Daxing District, Wangfujing shopping belt and the Central Business District. In Shanghai, some 236,029 sq m and 416,476 sq m of retail space are expected to be completed this year respectively in prime locations and the decentralised region.\n\nMr Tan said he remains positive on China's long-term outlook and underlying consumption growth. Units of CRCT closed 2.2 per cent higher at S$1.615 after the release of its Q2 results. The ex-date for the distribution is Aug 6 and it will be paid out on Sept 25.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/too-early-ease-property-cooling-measures-mas", "site_title": "Too early to ease property cooling measures: MAS", "publish_date": null, "content": "Too early to ease property cooling measures: MAS\n\nRisk factors have not changed, property prices still at elevated levels\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Jul 24, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] The Monetary Authority of Singapore said it is too early to ease property cooling measures as prices remain high.\n\nRisk factors have not changed, MAS managing director Ravi Menon said at the MAS annual report 2013/2014 press conference yesterday.\n\nProperty prices remain at elevated levels although they have started to soften, he said.\n\nPrices went up 60 per cent over the last four years but have declined by just 3.3 per cent over the last three quarters, he said.\n\nGlobal interest rates are still at historical lows, and \"if you relax property measures in the current easy environment, you may set off another spiral of price increase,\" he said.\n\nThe level of debt among highly leveraged households remains high, though the growth of debt has moderated, he said.\n\nFor these highly leveraged households, reducing the level of debt will take time and they need to work with their banks and commit to debt repayment plans, he said.\n\n\"On the whole, MAS's view is that it's premature to ease property cooling measures now.\"\n\nMr Menon's comments come amid increasing calls by developers and other parties urging the authorities to start rolling back cooling measures such as the additional buyer's stamp duty and the seller's stamp duty.\n\nEarly this month, the National Development Ministry responded by saying it was still too early to roll back property cooling measures. It said that although home sales have decreased, prices have remained relatively stable.\n\nYesterday, Mr Menon said that it is important to secure gains in stabilising the market and restoring financial prudence.\n\nThe number of over-leveraged households to property purchases remain broadly similar to last year - 5-10 per cent, he said. Over-leveraging is seen when total debt servicing payments exceed 60 per cent of monthly income.\n\n\"It's stopped getting worse,\" but people take time, \"a couple of years\" to adjust and reschedule their debt repayments.\n\nThat's why it's important to be pro-active in cooling the market, Mr Menon said.\n\nThe property cooling measures have helped to strengthen overall household balance sheets in two ways, he said.\n\nFirst, they have tempered the growth of household debt. Year-on-year growth of household debt has moderated from nearly 13 per cent in the third quarter of 2011 to 5.5 per cent in the first quarter of this year.\n\nSecond, the risk profile of new housing loan borrowers has improved.\n\nAlmost all new housing loans granted since the introduction of total debt servicing ratio or TDSR, were within 60 per cent threshold.\n\nMr Menon also said that there's no timeline or target on when the government might decide to relax some of the measures.\n\nA sharp reduction in property prices will impact the economy. He said that the MAS does not want to see a collapse in the property market, it's not good for the economy.\n\nBanks here are resilient to property market shocks, he said.\n\nStress tests of our banks during last year's Financial Sector Assessment Programme by the International Monetary Fund showed they were resilient against various stress scenarios.\n\nThese stresses included a combination of domestic interest rates increasing by more than 200 basis points; the unemployment rate rising above 10 per cent; cumulative decline in equity prices up to 70 per cent over three years; and cumulative decline in residential property prices up to 50 per cent over three years.\n\nMAS's own stress test this year - assuming more disorderly unwinding of quantitative easing in the US and higher levels of US dollar funding squeeze - shows similar results, he said.\n\nLatest data show a big jump in private home purchase in Q2 over Q1. DTZ's analysis of URA Realis caveats data showed a 37.1 per cent quarter-on-quarter increase in the total number of private homes transacted to 3,369 units in Q2.\n\nDespite the recovery in Q2, the 5,826 total private homes sold in the first-half of this year is less than half the 13,651 units transacted in the first-half of last year - reflecting the dent on transactions created by the TDSR framework since its introduction in late-June 2013, noted Lee Lay Keng, regional head (SEA), research at DTZ.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The restriction on investment in development was one central reason holding back growth in the city's Reit market, he added.\n\nHong Kong has 10 actively traded Reits, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The market value of Reits in Hong Kong stood at US$17.2 billion at the end of 2013, compared to US$71.2 billion in Japan and US$40.3 billion in Singapore, according to an April paper released by the association.\n\nHong Kong issued rules allowing Reits in 2003 and the Link Reit, which owns neighbourhood malls, food markets and car parks, became the first such trust to list in the city in 2005, according to the SFC and data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe earlier restrictions were imposed to ensure Reits mainly invested in income-generating properties and because real estate development may require different skills from Reit management, SFC said in its January consultation paper on the rule change.\n\nAllowing Reits to invest in redevelopment of their existing assets as they age will potentially be more important, Mr Yeung said.\n\nOtherwise, Reits will either have to manage an older and thus less competitive portfolio or sell the older assets to someone else for redevelopment, he added.\n\nWhen Reits participate in property development, they are in general required to hold the properties for at least two years after completion, SFC said in the latest statement. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

Why, make movies, of course - lots of them. After various incarnations over the years in a variety of sword-and-sandal epics, kid- friendly Disney animated features (Hercules, 1997) and campy B-movies (The Legend of Hercules, 2014), the adventures of the son of Zeus have proven to be rock-solid fodder for filmmakers.\n\nIt's only appropriate then that the actor formerly known as The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) has taken on the title role in the latest version to hit the big screen. Hercules, directed by Brett Ratner and based on the graphic novel Hercules: The Thracian Wars, is a revisionist take on the original Greek myth, infused with modern-day sensibilities, lightweight humour and more ugly hairstyles than a convention of Premier League footballers.\n\nIt's just as well that Ratner and screenwriters Ryan Condal and Evan Spiliotopoulos didn't take themselves or Hercules too seriously. Their version of the club-wielding Greco-Roman demigod with the ripped abs and the lionskin hoodie is a little bit removed from the stuff of legend. Instead, he's reinvented as muscle for hire, fighting not for glory but for gold.\n\nHercules and his band of merry mercenaries are well versed in the art of warfare and can help to transform a ragtag army into a mean fighting machine - the kind any self-respecting despot would want at his disposal. Hercules may (or may not) have undertaken the so-called Twelve Labours that sealed his reputation - slaying the multi-headed Hydra and other assorted beasts - but he's certainly doing nothing to dispel those feats of derring-do.\n\nThe backstory, involving the brutal murder of his wife and children, causes our hero anguish and nightmares but he fights on with grim resolve and a heavy heart, hoping to one day lay that particular beast to rest. Meanwhile, he cracks jokes as well as heads for a living.\n\nThe main mission, given to Hercules by Ergenia (Rebecca Ferguson), daughter of the Thracian King Cotys (John Hurt), is to protect Thrace from the clutches of Rhesus (Tobias Santelmann), a warlord whose army is rampaging through the Thracian countryside. Have Hercules and his travel buddies - including Amphiaraus (Ian McShane), Autolycus (Rufus Sewell), Atalanta (Ingrid Bolso Berdal) and Tydeus (Aksel Hennie) - bitten off more than they can chew this time?\n\nAs portrayed by Johnson, an actor whose screen presence far outweighs his acting range, Hercules is believably larger than life. Compared to mere mortals, everything about him is magnified: his legs are the size of tree trunks, he has a four-horse chariot (everyone else has two), and his weapon of choice makes Thor's hammer look like a limp toothpick.\n\nThe CGI action is interesting in parts but limited in scope; after all, we expect the good guys to win in the end. Despite a twist or two in the plot and some doubt as to who in Team Hercules won't make it out alive, there's barely any suspense to keep us on the edge of our seats. Even demigods can have a bad day in the battlefield but when push comes to shove (and there's a fair amount of shoving at the end), the hero always rises to the top.\n\nRating:\n\nC\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The show brings to the stage 50 horses and 43 artists (including riders, acrobats and musicians), putting together what Mr Latourelle calls \"a dream-like performance for audiences who just want to forget about the outside world for a while\".\n\nThe White Theatre Tent is the largest touring tent in the world, 35 metres high and with a space of 2,440 square metres, all for the benefit of their star acts. About 10 other tents occupy the area, including a VIP tent and a stable for the horses.\n\nCavalia was created by Mr Latourelle 11 years ago, although the original idea came to him a decade before that. \"I had created a show in Montreal, and there was this one horse that was an extra in the show, but I noticed the moment it stepped on the stage, it just stole all the attention.\"\n\nThe name Cavalia was created by Mr Latourelle from a combination of the word \"horse\" or \"rider\" in different languages.\n\nMr Latourelle says Singapore is their starting point as they felt it would be easier to transition into Asia from here.\n\n\"Firstly, everyone speaks English,\" he notes. \"And we felt the Singapore market was ready for something like Cavalia. Also BASE entertainment, who we're working with, suggested we come during the Year of the Horse, which we felt would be a nice touch.\"\n\nThe show might include riding tricks, but Mr Latourelle is quick to dismiss comparisons of Cavalia to circus acts, saying that the concept and philosophy of Cavalia is anything but circus-like. \"It's not really a theatre show either - there are no storylines. Cavalia is like a poem. They don't have storylines, but you can still feel the connection and have different emotions with it,\" he explains. \"It's actually closer to a horse ballet.\"\n\nIn fact, some parts of the performance consist of simply the horses on stage, interacting with their trainers. Also, unlike a circus, you need not worry about sweating it out in a tiny tent; the performance area is air-conditioned.\n\nThe animal activists and horse-lovers need not worry, Mr Latourelle says, as Cavalia's horses are the most well-treated in the world. In fact, even on stage they are encouraged to horse around, so to speak. \"We don't use spurs or whips to train our horses either. That's not our philosophy, we are not a circus,\" he points out.\n\nNot that managing the horses is easy. Mr Latourelle compares them to three-year-old kids. \"They can travel well, but you have to be organised, you have to entertain them. There can be no waiting.\" To keep the horses happy, they travel in their own planes, with masseuses and caretakers as well.\n\n\"For Cavalia, a happy horse is a good horse. We accept that horses don't do perfect tricks. We adapt to them, and create a stage where they enjoy working and playing,\" says Mr Latourelle. He adds, laughing: \"In fact, when something goes wrong, we believe it is never the horse's fault, it is the person's.\"\n\n'Cavalia' runs from Aug 12 to Sept 14, under the White Theatre Tent at Marina Bay Sands Bayfront Avenue.

June was the first month this year to see a contraction in aircraft movements.\n\nThis takes the tally for the first six months of this year to 26.61 million passengers, edging up just 1.4 per cent year on year, while the number of flights taking off and landing grew at a stronger 2.9 per cent to 171,680. Meanwhile, cargo shipments inched up 0.6 per cent to 910,100 tonnes.\n\n\"Travel demand within the Asia-Pacific region spurred traffic growth for the half year, with traffic to North-east Asia and South Asia growing 5.1 per cent and 4.1 per cent, respectively,\" said airport operator Changi Airport Group (CAG) in a release.\n\nChangi's five busiest routes were Jakarta, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Manila, according to CAG. Bali saw a surge of 31 per cent in passengers in H1, making it the fastest growing route among Changi's top 10.\n\nChina and Thailand saw weaker traffic. For H1, traffic to and from China and Thailand declined 1.8 per cent and 18.1 per cent, respectively.\n\nTravel demand for Thailand has felt the impact of ongoing political tensions, which culminated in the Thai military seizing control of the country in May.\n\nPassenger traffic from China has also declined in the wake of the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in March, which had many Chinese citizens onboard. Chinese travellers - who typically visit countries such as Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand together - have been avoiding travel to Malaysia.\n\nPreliminary numbers on the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) website showed that visitor arrivals in Singapore for January to April were down 0.6 per cent at 5.13 million. On average, visitor arrivals from China were down nearly 22 per cent for the four-month period.\n\nLast week's fatal tragedy, where commercial flight MH17 was downed over eastern Ukraine, could see visitor arrivals from Europe to South-east Asia drop, analysts have said. This could affect loads for full service carriers from South-east Asia.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Category A - for cars below 1,600cc and 130 hp - was S$900 higher at S$62,890, while Cat B - for cars above 1,600cc or 130 hp - inched up S$112 to S$65,001.\n\nCat E - the open category which currently tracks Cat B - was up S$2,001 to S$65,002.\n\nMeanwhile, Cat D - for motorcycles - advanced S$251 to S$4,252.\n\nBut it was Cat C - for goods vehicles - that posted the biggest increase among the categories; it shot up S$8,620 to S$52,010.\n\nThe spike, however, was not completely unexpected. Last week, it was announced that the next August to October 2014 quota would have 33.1 per cent fewer Cat C COEs, or one-third. This translates to 515 a month, or fewer than 260 pieces per tender.\n\n\"That is too little for the whole market,\" says the sales director of a mid-sized commercial vehicle dealership.\n\n\"ETS can only help existing owners who want to upgrade,\" he added, referring to the successful Early Turnover Scheme, under which a buyer of a commercial vehicle does not have to bid for a COE but instead pays a pro-rated COE based on the prevailing quota premium. \"New buyers who do not have an existing vehicle cannot take advantage of ETS.\"\n\nBased on the current situation, the sales director says he believes the Cat C COE premium may rise to S$55,000 or more next month.\n\n\"And if the Cat C quota continues to be cut further, goods vehicle premiums will be as high as passenger car premiums,\" he says.\n\nAs for the Cat A and B premiums, they are \"flat\" because sentiment is \"no good\", according to the managing director of a large dealership.\n\n\"There's no interest,\" he says. \"The stock market is not moving, so people can't make money there. And many retailers are feeling the pinch because of fewer Chinese tourists.\"\n\nEven the launch this week of the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class may have limited impact.\n\n\"The C-Class is a popular model and many people have been looking forward to its arrival,\" he says. \"It will definitely spark a lot of interest but because the overall market is weak, I don't think it will affect premiums much.\"\n\nThe extra COEs for the small and big car categories from next month onwards should also temper any upward pressure. From August to October, Cat A and B will enjoy a 13.1 and 4.6-per cent increase in COEs respectively.

Worst hit were the bottom 20 per cent of households: their larger expenditure shares on food and healthcare costs meant they experienced a higher inflation rate (excluding imputed rentals on owner-occupied accommodation) at 2 per cent, compared to the middle 60 per cent income group and the richest fifth of households (both at 1.7 per cent).\n\nCIMB and DBS economists agreed that much of the increase in food and healthcare costs was the result of ongoing restructuring efforts, where a tight labour market has pushed costs (and therefore prices) up.\n\nSaid DBS's Irvin Seah: \"Restructuring is inflationary in nature, and it will affect everything. Even if we are unable to bring healthcare costs lower, we should try to moderate the pace of increase.\"\n\nAccording to a report released by the Department of Statistics (DOS) yesterday, Singapore households experienced a 1.7 per cent inflation rate in the first half of this year compared to the same period in 2013. This was lower than the 1.9 per cent rise seen in the preceding six months.\n\nExcluding imputed rentals on owner-occupied accommodation, the consumer price index (CPI) went up by 1.7 per cent in H1 2014 - slightly higher than the increase of 1.5 per cent in the second half of 2013.\n\nAs for the second half of this year, the government expects headline inflation to ease, due to lower car prices and accommodation costs.\n\nWhile the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) had said last month that car prices are likely to \"add negligibly\" to inflation, they now believe these will in fact exert \"a slight drag\" on overall inflation - given the larger-than-expected increase in vehicle certificate of entitlement (COE) quotas.\n\nImputed rentals on owner-occupied accommodation are projected to be lower too (instead of stabilising as earlier anticipated); economists say this reflects the large supply of newly completed housing units and the continued effects of property cooling measures.\n\nIndeed, the drop in last month's headline inflation figure was led by private road transport costs and rentals. Consumer price inflation eased more than expected to a three-month low of 1.8 per cent in June from 2.7 per cent in May - falling far short of the market's projection of a 2.4 per cent year-on-year rise.\n\nPrivate road transport costs edged up 2.8 per cent in June, which was a smaller rise compared to the 8.1 per cent surge a month earlier, largely due to the sharp correction in COE premiums in May.\n\nContributions from other major categories, except food, were also slightly lower.\n\nAccommodation costs increased at a slower pace of 0.5 per cent in June compared to 0.9 per cent the month before, as imputed rentals on owner-occupied accommodation picked up more modestly.\n\nServices inflation eased to 2.2 per cent from 2.5 per cent in May, owing to lower contributions from the cost of holiday travel, telecommunications, and medical insurance.\n\nBut food inflation came in at 3.2 per cent in June - higher than May's 3 per cent and the fastest monthly increase since January 2012 - reflecting steeper price increases of both non-cooked food items and prepared meals.\n\nMAS core inflation inched down to 2.1 per cent in June from 2.2 per cent a month before, as the steeper increase in food prices was more than offset by the decline in services inflation.\n\nFollowing MAS and MTI's narrower inflation forecast, several private sector economists yesterday downgraded their inflation projections. These included Bank of America Merill Lynch's (BAML) Chua Hak Bin (1.8 per cent, from 2.2 per cent); CIMB's Song Seng Wun (1.5 per cent, from 2 per cent); and Citi's Kit Wei Zheng (1.2 per cent, from 1.5-2 per cent).\n\nUOB's Alvin Liew and Quek Ser Leang said they were \"looking to review\" their forecast, which currently stands at 2.8 per cent.\n\nWhile analysts expect MAS to keep its \"modest and gradual\" Singapore dollar NEER (nominal effective exchange rate) appreciation stance, at least two economists have flagged the \"small\" possibility that this will change come October, at the next monetary policy meeting.\n\nSaid BAML's Dr Chua: \"Slowing GDP growth may prompt a shift in view. GDP growth expanded just 2.1 per cent in Q2, as restructuring hurt both manufacturing and services. In our view, there is now a small probability of MAS shifting gears to a neutral bias, if the downturn intensifies and core inflation slips below 2 per cent.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The other element of this is that we need to market ourself more like a network carrier, rather than a point-to-point carrier.\"\n\nRegional carrier Tiger and medium/long-haul budget carrier Scoot have previously applied to the Competition Commission of Singapore to deepen their partnership, which - if approved - would allow them to work together on areas such as scheduling and provide better connectivity across both their networks. Tiger also has alliances with other carriers such as Cebu Pacific.\n\nIn addition, Tiger wants to widen distribution channels overseas, such as by roping in travel agents.\n\nThe group yesterday unveiled a net loss of S$65.22 million for the first quarter ended 30 June, 2014, widening from a loss of S$32.77 million in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. Its performance was weighed down by a S$35.33 million share of loss from associate Tigerair Mandala and a S$14.61 million provision for the shutdown costs of the Indonesia-based carrier. The bleeding Tigerair Mandala ceased operations on July 1. Loss of loss of associates and a joint venture in the year-ago period was S$26.6 million.\n\nTiger, which previously announced plans to ground eight aircraft, will receive another four from Tigerair Mandala. It is aiming to place out these planes.\n\nRevenue slumped 28.4 per cent to S$169.04 million due to the exclusion of Tigerair Australia which ceased to be a subsidiary of the group from 8 July 2013, while loss per share (LPS) worked out to 6.61 Singapore cents, versus a LPS of 3.32 Singapore cents previously.\n\nThe group turned in an operating loss of S$16.4 million in 1QFY15, deepening from a loss of S$6.21 million in 1QFY14.\n\nTigerair Singapore's revenue grew by 3.2 per cent to S$166 million, but it recorded an operating loss of S$19.8 million vis-a-vis an operating profit of S$5.9 million previously as yields fell 11.5 per cent and expenses went up 20 per cent. South-east Asian budget carriers are seeing yields come under pressure as a result of overcapacity in the region.\n\nThe number of passengers carried increased 16.4 per cent and load factor climbed 0.8 percentage point to 84.7 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, Tiger's unrecognised cumulative share of loss from Tigerair Australia as at 30 June 2014 was S$16.9 million.\n\nThe group said that it will continue to rationalise its network, while striving to manage costs. Tigerair Singapore is suspending Lijiang from its network over July-September and axing Trivandrum from its network, while reducing frequencies on routes such as Bangkok, Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur. It is, however, boosting frequency to Manila.\n\nThe counter closed at 44.5 Singapore cents yesterday, unchanged.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Chamber of Commerce has published a brochure for local shopkeepers with Russian phrases. Residents sometimes stop their cars to get a glimpse of the Russians playing soccer or sunning themselves near where their ship is docked.\n\nSaint-Nazaire, a shipbuilding city on the Atlantic coast south-west of Paris, is used to seeing sailors from around the world. But few have been the subject of as much interest and debate as those who arrived here last month to begin training on the first of two warships built for the Russian navy by France.\n\nEven before the downing of a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet over Ukraine put new pressure on Europe to impose stiffer sanctions on Russia, France's decision to proceed with the sale of the warships to Moscow and to train the Russian navy in how to operate them had prompted opposition and concern from the United States and other nations.\n\nNow, with much of Europe showing signs of taking a harder line with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Saint-Nazaire has become a symbol of the difficult trade-off between diplomatic and national concerns on the one hand, and jobs and an economic future on the other.\n\nThe challenge facing France is one that many European nations are grappling with: Is Britain willing to risk the huge sums of Russian money that flow through London's financial district? Is Germany willing to endanger the supply of natural gas from Russia?\n\nBut in few places is the trade-off quite as stark or direct as it is here. Like many shipbuilding centres, Saint-Nazaire has fallen on hard times. The unemployment rate is around 14 per cent. In 2009, the main shipbuilder, STX France, put half the shipyard's 2,500 employees on reduced hours, forcing them to take partial unemployment benefits.\n\nIn that kind of climate, the US$1.6 billion deal signed in 2011 by then-president Nicolas Sarkozy to build two Mistral-class amphibious assault ships for Russia, and to train the Russians in operating them, was viewed here as a triumph. The Russian sailors are now in Saint-Nazaire to train on the first of the ships, the Vladivostok, which is scheduled for delivery in November. The second, the Sevastopol, is scheduled for delivery next year.\n\n\"I hope that the sale of the Vladivostok will be the start of a sustainable cooperation with Russia,\" said Christophe Morel, a union delegate at the STX France shipyard. \"It doesn't happen often, and helps 7,000 to 8,000 people make a living.\"- NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM", "images": []}

Didi Supriyanto, a member of his legal team, said yesterday that \"we are filing a lawsuit not merely to become the president, but more to show an election process that we consider has legal defects due to violations during the process.\"\n\nAlongside a court contest Mr Prabowo will seek a parliamentary special commission to investigate the election and ask police to probe the alleged fraud, his spokesman Tantowi Yahya told reporters in Jakarta. Mr Prabowo had pulled out of the tally after calling the ballot \"undemocratic\".\n\nBut many analysts believe it would be near impossible for Mr Prabowo to overturn the result of the election, seen as among the cleanest in the country's history. The losers in the previous two presidential elections also went to the Court to raise objections, but to no avail.\n\nIndonesia shares and the rupiah rose on news of Jokowi's win. The currency rose 0.9 per cent in the biggest advance since July 7 to close at 11,505 per dollar, prices from local banks show. It reached 11,483 earlier, the highest level since May 20. The Jakarta Composite Index of shares gained 0.2 per cent to close at 5,093.23.\n\nWhile Indonesia has lured record overseas investment in recent years, supply bottlenecks and limited public transportation have held back its potential.\n\n\"We must be realistic,\" Jokowi said of his country's economic challenges. The onetime head of a furniture business has pledged to curb fuel subsidies that have sapped funds needed for infrastructure, and to rein in corruption, in part by moving to an online tax system.\n\nAsia's fifth-biggest economy saw growth slow to 5.21 per cent in the first quarter, the weakest pace since 2009, and hasn't seen a pace of 7 per cent or more on an annual basis since the years before the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis - the turmoil of which helped bring down dictator Suharto.\n\nClad in an untucked white shirt with the sleeves rolled up in the living room of his house, a barefoot Jokowi embodied the down-to-earth image that resonated among millions of voters in the July 9 election. The interview was conducted over cups of tea, with the television on in the background and no uniformed security in sight.\n\nJokowi secured 53.15 per cent of votes, according to the General Elections Commission, beating Mr Prabowo, a 62-year-old former army commando who was once married to Suharto's daughter and won 46.85 per cent. The contest divided Indonesia between those looking for a more liberal democracy and those nostalgic for a leader who projects strength and decisiveness.\n\nLooking ahead to his agenda after taking office in October, Jokowi cast a robust economy as key to projecting a revitalised Indonesia in the region. \"When our economy grows more than 7 per cent I am very confident for Indonesia to play a role in the world, not only in the Asean Economic Community but also in international forums,\" he said, referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations' efforts towards economic integration.\n\nJokowi's coalition has 37 per cent of seats in parliament after elections in April. Some officials in parties in alliance with Mr Prabowo, such as Golkar, have indicated they may switch to Jokowi, which would make it easier for him to pass laws even as a more diverse group could make it harder to get consensus on policy changes.\n\n\"He's faced with a fragmented parliament and potentially a parliament that he might not have control of,\" Euben Paracuelles, a Singapore-based economist at Nomura Holdings Inc, said of Jokowi. \"Where he could make an impact is medium-term potential growth for Indonesia which would obviously take time to show up. But the reforms that are needed to get there have to be done now.\"\n\nJokowi said that as he transitions to power he will start discussions on a Cabinet line up, and is open to current ministers joining. He will also seek further details on the budget position from the finance and trade ministries and the national planning ministry, \"because I really want to know the real condition\" of the economy. \"I'm willing to take the professional, the technocrat and only the best,\" he said in the hour-long interview.\n\nSpeaking on Monday, Jokowi said that dealing with the burden of state fuel subsidies will be a challenge. \"I'm confident but it must be done gradually,\" he said.\n\nJokowi has also pledged to tackle corruption to boost growth, by moving tax collection and government services online, including procurement. \"If we can build the new system it can save our money, our budget, after that I think we can cut the corruption 70 per cent if we can build the new system,\" Jokowi said. \"Thirty per cent is law enforcement.\"\n\nThat means adding staff to the graft-busting agency, he said.\n\nFor Jokowi, that means replicating the processes he put in place first as mayor of the Central Java city of Solo and then as Jakarta governor beginning in 2012.\n\n\"My experience in Solo city is very important, my experience in Jakarta province is also very important to manage this country,\" he said. \"More or less similar - this is small scale, this is on a medium scale, this is on a large scale.

The LTA's numbers include both official and parallel imports.\n\nAt McLaren, four units were registered in the first six months, against 17 a year ago.\n\nThings were so bad that one dealership with a waiting list apparently had some customers deferring registration of their cars when the vehicles arrived.\n\nOne person familiar with the situation said: \"They asked to pass their allocation to the next buyer in line.\"\n\nThe year-to-date dip is further magnified by H1 2013's high base. After a tiered Additional Registration Fee (ARF) structure and new vehicle financing restrictions were imposed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore from Feb 25, 2013, many buyers of such high-end sports models \"fast forwarded\" their purchases in order to beat the cooling measures.\n\nThis was possible because transferable Category E or \"open\" COEs are valid for three months, while non-transferable Category B COEs for big cars expire six months after they are secured.\n\nAfter the registration rush, demand tapered immediately.\n\nAt Ferrari's Italian rival, Lamborghini, only two units have been registered this year - an Aventador coupe and an Aventador roadster, which start at S$1.588 million.\n\nBut Lamborghini's situation is compounded by the fact that sales of its entry-level Gallardo model, which used to cost between S$800,000 and S$900,000, ended in mid-2013.\n\nHowever, Lamborghini hopes to make up for lost time when its replacement, the Huracan, starts arriving in early September. It is understood that so far, a few dozen units of this S$1.168 million car have been booked.\n\nThe relatively strong demand for the Huracan is what some supercar dealers now call their biggest problem.\n\n\"Unless it's a new model, something that is considered 'worth buying' for its novelty, you won't get many customers these days,\" said the director of a sports car dealership.\n\nHe said that it's because buyers find it hard to stomach the increases in ARF, which went from a flat rate to being a progressive tax.\n\n\"Take what used to be a roughly S$1 million car early last year,\" he said. \"Suddenly, the price goes up by over S$200,000. It's still the same car, but now it costs 20 per cent more. Buyers don't like paying more for the same thing. But if it's a new model, they don't mind as much.\"\n\nThe 50 per cent cash downpayment is another roadblock.\n\n\"It's a double whammy,\" said the director. \"But it's not a question of affordability, because these high net worth individuals are still spending on luxury watches and overseas properties. They just don't feel good about the credit terms, or prefer to use the cash for other things.\"\n\nThe managing director of another high-end dealership described the high taxes as a \"mental block\".\n\n\"It's affecting the whole price spectrum and it will take time to overcome. Those who used to take high loans can't do it now, while those who can afford it find the price hike hard to justify.\"\n\nFortunately, new buyers - that is, those who are new to the super car segment - are less affected by the tax increases.\n\nThe managing director said: \"They have no basis for comparison, so they don't feel like they are paying more.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Tragedy and political upheaval provide a chance for Malaysia Airlines and Thai Airways to restructure deeper than before. The state shareholders of the two similarly sized loss-making national carriers are backing reform after crisis hit. Yet, the problem is widespread. Even when in good shape, running an airline in an oversupplied region is a tough business.\n\nMalaysia Airlines was already battling falling ticket sales after one of its flights en route to Beijing disappeared without a trace five months ago. The missile that brought down MH17 in Ukraine last Thursday may push its finances over the brink. The airline will almost certainly need a capital injection by next year. Thai Airways, meanwhile, saw its passenger numbers slump 31 per cent year-on-year last month after the military took power in the country. It is highly leveraged too, with net debt to reach 9.5 times its Ebitda this year, according to Eikon estimates.\n\nAirlines in the region already face intense competition, especially from low cost carriers such as AirAsia, which as a group have almost 60 per cent market share by capacity. South-east Asia is the only part of the world where airlines have more planes on order than in their fleet, according to the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation. Nearby Middle Eastern carriers backed by rich governments are expanding rapidly too. At the same time, oil prices have kept costs high.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM", "images": []}

The overall US stock market, which leads global stock markets, has a current PE of 20; ie, the market is saying that it will take 20 years on current average US earnings to reach present stock prices.\n\nAnalysts also maintain that several companies have effectively massaged earnings via share buybacks. The most undervalued markets are Russia, because of its deteriorating economy and sanctions, and China because of market fears about its banking system and opaque accounting.\n\nRegardless of geopolitical risk, US and global markets have risen, with limited setbacks, because of the liquidity of the US Federal Reserve Board's quantitative easing (QE) programme. Persistent uncertainty continues on how this monetary easing will end.\n\nThe United States has tightened sanctions against Russia and the alleged shooting down of the Malaysian Airline plane with a Russian missile is expected to bring in its wake more stringent European Union sanctions against that country.\n\nBoth Britain and the Netherlands (which had the worst casualties) have appealed to Germany and other European Union members to sanction trade unless Moscow withdraws support to pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine.\n\nUntil the tragedy, Germany, France and several other EU nations were reluctant to impose tough sanctions because of their trade with Russia and their dependence on oil and gas imports from the country. Trade has already declined sharply, according to official EU statistics, but it will now be difficult to resist demands from the Netherlands and Britain.\n\nIn Washington, hawks want even tougher economic sanctions, which would sharply reduce Russia's oil and gas exports and revenues, hit foreign investment and slash Russian growth. They would also like to boost US and Nato forces near the Polish border, Baltic republics and north-east Romania.\n\nThe US and EU are trying to help the new Ukraine government, which cannot be regarded as blameless in the conflict. The government has bombed the rebels and this has precipitated the counter attacks on war planes and tragically the Malaysian airline.\n\nRussia could squeeze Ukraine by demanding much higher prices for its energy and its financial requirements are estimated at US$36 billion this year. The failed state would have defaulted but for a US$18 billion IMF rescue package and a US$15.5 billion aid plan from the EU.\n\nIran, the US and the five other countries negotiating over the future of the Iranian nuclear programme have agreed to a four-month extension from the July 20 deadline. The spin from the participants is that the delay will give them more time to try to either persuade or force Iran to dismantle parts of its nuclear infrastructure.\n\nAmerican officials say that even the additional time may not prove sufficient, but US Secretary of State John Kerry said that under the extension, Iran would still get access to US$2.8 billion in assets that have been frozen in the United States. Sanctions against oil sales and other major sources of income would not be lifted, he added.\n\nPessimists fear that the lax policy of the Western negotiators opens the door to sanctions busters and that Iran will use the extra time to build a nuclear device.\n\nIran is regarded by geopolitical analysts as a mischief maker in the Middle East. The nation has supplied some 10,000 rockets to Hamas and also numerous rockets to Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nIsrael has been widely criticised for firing missiles at Gaza which has a high population density, but the Israeli response is that thousands of rockets have been fired by Hamas.\n\nThere is also a claim that Iranian engineers who built tunnels for Hezbollah during a conflict a few years ago, have built munitions and attack tunnels for Hamas. The Iranian government, via their proxy Hezbollah, is also involved in the Syrian and Iraq conflict, it is alleged.\n\nWhile international attention has been focused on the airline disaster and Israel's conflict in Gaza, the expansion of the so-called ISIS caliphate of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Sunni insurgent, continues in both Iraq and Syria. Oil prices have fallen slightly in the northern hemisphere summer, but they could easily rise again.\n\nOther geopolitical problems include North Korea and its nuclear capability and the rift between China and Japan.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

While dealing with armed rebels and looters isn't unprecedented, investigators are limited if they can't get to a crash site at all.\n\n\"This has nothing to do with the aircraft or the air-travel system - it's all about a wartime atrocity,\" said Richard Aboulafia, vice-president at Fairfax, Virginia-based Teal Group Corp, an aviation consultant.\n\n\"I can't imagine any company would be eager to force its way into a situation that won't yield a result. There'll be no clarity until the site is secure, and in the hands of a responsible body of adults.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian government set up a special commission, led by the deputy premier and including interior ministry, intelligence and aviation officials, to study who fired the missile and why.\n\nRepresentatives of the UK, the Netherlands and the US are in Kiev helping the Ukrainian government set up a separate structure under United Nations rules to investigate the aviation aspects of the case, a US government official who's been briefed on the group's progress said on Sunday.\n\nMalaysia's Transport Minister, Liow Tiong Lai, said that his country is also on the investigations team and has sent 133 officials and specialists to Kiev.\n\nThe aviation team hasn't been allowed to go to the crash scene, which is being patrolled by hundreds of armed men from the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, the US official said.\n\nFor now, the group will study airspace restrictions in eastern Ukraine at the time of the incident and the history of the flight, said this person, who asked not to be identified because he wasn't authorised to speak about the situation.\n\nWhile the Ukraine conflict has created unusual challenges, accident investigators have dealt with armed rebels and looted crash sites before, said John Purvis, the former chief accident investigator for Boeing.\n\nAfter the Dec 29, 1994, crash of a 737-400 in eastern Turkey that killed 57 people, investigators from Boeing were hindered because the area was involved in a insurrection by anti-government rebels, he said.\n\n\"The military got in control of the site, but you couldn't come in by road,\" he said. \"You had to fly in because the rebels controlled the surrounding ground areas.\"\n\nThe government forces sent to protect them weren't very reassuring, Mr Purvis' subordinates at the scene told him.\n\n\"The place was patrolled by 14-year-olds with rifles,\" he said.\n\nInvestigators eventually got the two crash-proof recorders, known as black boxes, that they usually rely on after aviation accidents to piece together what happened. They determined the Turkish Airlines pilots were confused and hit the side of a mountain in a snowstorm, he said.\n\nThere were conflicting reports on Sunday on the whereabouts of the Malaysian airliner's black boxes.\n\nAn aide for the Donetsk Peoples' Republic's self-proclaimed prime minister, Alexander Borodai, said on Sunday that some \"technical parts\" that may be the recorders are in Donetsk and will be turned over to international organisations. That hasn't been confirmed by any of those organisations.\n\nPress representatives for the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the United Nations agency that separatists earlier said would get the recorders, didn't return phone calls and e-mail messages for comment.\n\nA number of world leaders and the Moscow-based Interstate Aviation Committee have said that the ICAO should lead the probe.- Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM", "images": []}

Singapore's Ministry of Transport (MOT) has also expressed concern that the move was directed at Singaporean vehicles, given that the fee would be imposed only in Johor and not at any other checkpoint.\n\nWhile the implementation date and the exact amount have not yet been revealed, Johor's Menteri Besar Mohamed Khaled Nordin was reported to have proposed a fee of RM20 (S$7.80). There has been some talk that it could be as high as RM50 - an amount cited by Johor's State Public Works, Rural and Regional Development Committee chairman Hasni Mohammad earlier this month.\n\nSome commentators have wondered if Malaysia's decision is a retaliatory one, given that it was made just a little over two weeks after Singapore's Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced that it was raising the Vehicle Entry Permit fees for foreign-registered cars from S$20 to S$35 per day from Aug 1. The fees for goods vehicles will also go up from S$10 to S$40 per calendar month.\n\nLTA, however, has clarified that the basis of increasing those fees was not discriminatory, but one that served to \"equalise\" the cost of using foreign-registered vehicles on Singapore roads with that of Singapore-registered vehicles.\n\nAny fee increase, be it on the Singapore or Malaysia side, doesn't bode well for either nation. For Singapore, it might result in Malaysian companies passing on the extra charges to consumers. On Malaysia's part, its new levy could deter Singaporeans from going to the new Iskandar Malaysia zone, at a time when the facilities and attractions are being ramped up at a furious pace.\n\nAs the debate over the higher levies rages on, this also underscores the lack of public transport links between Singapore and Malaysia. It is perhaps time for the authorities on both sides to beef up the existing links, so as to give commuters more choice when travelling from one country to the other.\n\nThere will be a Rapid Transit System link between Woodlands and Johor Baru, but this will be ready only in 2018. While bus services are fairly frequent, they are often packed on weekends and public holidays.\n\nThere is a new customs, immigration and quarantine complex and ferry terminal in Puteri Harbour that plies a ferry service between Johor and Batam and Karimun in Indonesia. There are reportedly plans to expand the route to include a service between Johor and Singapore's HarbourFront Centre terminal in the near future. This should be expedited to help ease the congestion at the land checkpoints. The bumper-to-bumper traffic jams that are a common sight at the Causeway only underscore the need for more and better options for commuters.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Overall industrial market rents are expected to remain stable or ease over the next six months,\" it said. This is part of governmental efforts to boost industrial space supply in order to ease rents.\n\nJTC also recently revised its subletting policy to increase the amount of space in a building that must be occupied by anchor tenants from 50 per cent to 70 per cent, which is likely to affect some industrial Reits here.\n\nUnits of the Reit finished trading one Singapore cent higher at S$1.45 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It was the plumpness of a strawberry that had distracted him.\n\nMr Gimbel, who once headed the hedge fund division of Credit Suisse, now spends more time discussing crop yields than stock or bond yields.\n\nHe is the man on the ground for a group of investors - including New York's biggest real estate dynasty, two Florida sugar barons and the founder of a multibillion-dollar investment firm - who have been buying up farms across the US through a real estate investment trust (Reit) called American Farmland Co.\n\nHedge funds are not new to farmland. For nearly a decade, they have scoured the corners of the globe for cheap land as food prices have soared, positioning themselves to profit from the growing demand. Hedge funds now have US$14 billion invested in farmland, according to data provider Preqin.\n\nBut in the latest twist, a small but growing group of sophisticated investors and bankers are combining crops and the soil they grow in into an asset class that ordinary investors can buy a piece of.\n\nFarmland Partners and Gladstone Land Corp, two Reits that also own and lease farmland, are trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange.\n\nFor now, American Farmland is a private company, and its founder, D Dixon Boardman, is pitching the vision to Wall Street. Corn, cotton, lemons, walnuts, avocados: if it grows in the ground and has an attractive income stream, he is peddling it.\n\n\"It's like gold, but better, because there is this cash flow,\" Mr Boardman said. The income stream comes from the rent farmers pay American Farmland and also often includes a share of the revenue from the crops. The company buys farms with permanent crops like almonds and avocados, and row crops like cotton and corn.\n\nDown the line, if American Farmland follows the same path as Farmland Partners and Gladstone Land and lists on a public exchange, Mr Boardman will have another audience to pitch his vision to: ordinary investors.\n\nAmerican Farmland has spent US$131 million on 16 farms and more than 4,450 hectares of tillable land. It's a small start, but Mr Boardman, Mr Gimbel and their partners have big ambitions. They are competing with investors that have huge war chests. Alaska's state pension fund, for example, had US$485.9 million invested in farmland in 2013. The world's biggest asset manager, BlackRock, has US$180 million of its clients' money in an agricultural fund, according to Preqin.\n\nThe latest wave of interest was generated by the 2008 financial crisis. As global food prices soared and opportunities to buy land abounded, investors like BlackRock, Whitebox Advisors, Ospraie Management and George Soros's hedge fund, Soros Fund Management, offered their clients ways to invest in the heartland. Investors were wary of the exotic sliced-and- diced securities that had contributed to the crisis, and farmland seemed more tangible.\n\n\"It was a major inflection point,\" said Philippe de Lap\u00e9rouse, managing director at agriculture consulting firm HighQuest Partners. \"At that time, investors were looking at farmland as an attractive asset to hold.\"\n\nMany individual investors were soon presented with a different challenge: farmland can be difficult to sell quickly. Some hedge funds stopped offering agriculture investments. But the flow of money from some of the country's largest pension funds has remained steady.\n\nWall Street's foray into farmland may present its own challenges. Shares in Farmland Partners and Gladstone Land have been volatile, indicating investor uncertainty. \"It's a question of whether it is really, in the long term, something that's going to appeal to investors,\" Mr de Lap\u00e9rouse said.\n\nMr Boardman and his partners think it will. They include Harrison T LeFrak, of the LeFrak real estate empire in New York; Alfonso and Pepe Fanjul, the Cuban-American owners of a sugar conglomerate; and William von Mueffling, founder of Cantillon Asset Management.\n\nMr Gimbel said: \"It's unlike any other asset class.\"\n\nAmerican Farmland teamed up with Prudential's agricultural-investment arm, Capital Agricultural Property Services, which runs a farm management and real estate brokerage business. The unit provides loans to farmers and manages farmland, giving American Farmland access to information in an often opaque real estate market. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Wealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom: survey\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

Almost anyone can post good numbers in a bull market, though. It's like sprinting downhill with the wind at your back - the chances are good that you'll be pleased with your own performance. Outperforming most other people consistently, year in and year out, is obviously a much more difficult feat in any competition. But how rare is it, exactly, for stock market investing?\n\nA new study by S&P Dow Jones Indices has some fresh and startling answers. The study Does Past Performance Matter? The Persistence Scorecard provides new arguments for investing in passively managed index funds - those that merely try to match market returns, not beat them.\n\nYet it won't end the debate over active versus passive investing, because it also shows that a small number of active investors do manage to turn in remarkably good streaks for fairly long periods.\n\nWhat's moving the markets?

In Singapore, demand for commercial space came from tenants in sectors as diverse as IT, multimedia and telecommunications, consultancy, oil-and-gas and the insurance sectors, FCOT said.\n\nNew, renewed or committed tenants in the third quarter included Xiaomi Singapore, SThree, Chain IQ Holding AG, and Yuan Tai Petrochemical.\n\nLow Chee Wah, the chief executive of the Reit manager, said: \"We will continue to focus on maintaining the strong occupancy rates for the portfolio and managing the expiring leases proactively. We are looking forward to the upcoming expiry of the master lease at Alexandra Technopark in August 2014, as this will further boost the performance of the Trust and provide greater growth.\"\n\nOnly 2.7 per cent of the remaining portfolio leases will be expiring in the financial year ending Sept 30.\n\nFCOT said its Singapore properties continue to enjoy rental uptrend, with positive rental reversions of 10.7-11.5 per cent in the third quarter. As at June 30, FCOT's S$1.8 billion portfolio of five properties in Singapore and Australia enjoyed a total occupancy rate of 98 per cent.\n\nThe declared DPU will be paid out on Aug 29.

Boardroom fights have also led to slow decision-making and a lack of coherent strategy, sources in the company say.\n\nThe junta led by Prayuth Chan-ocha has told the chief of the Royal Thai Air Force to fix the airline. Prajin Juntong, who also oversees economic matters for the military government, said on Friday that a detailed restructuring plan aimed at returning the carrier to profit will be considered by the board at a meeting on July 24.\n\nThe success or failure of Air Chief Marshal Prajin, who has little practical experience in running a business, will have wider implications for the government. The junta needs to assure foreign investors of its ability to manage the economy and that it is not out to merely weed out allies of previous prime ministers.\n\n\"You are right in noting that Prajin is a military man with little experience in running a company,\" Monthon Satchukorn, a spokesman for the Thai Air Force and a Prajin aide, told Reuters in an interview. \"Prajin is a man whom he (the junta leader) can trust,\" Air Vice Marshal Monthon said.\n\nAir Chief Marshal Prajin, who declined to be interviewed for this report, will be chairing the upcoming meeting with a smaller board this week. Five members have resigned since the junta came to power, reducing the board to 10 members.\n\nAmong the five who left was Ampon Kittiampon, who had been accused by the Thai Airways union of interfering with management and influencing executives whom he had close ties with. Mr Ampon, who resigned as chairman in March but had remained on the board, has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nMr Ampon was also the cabinet secretary under former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra. Her government was overthrown by the junta in May following months of sometimes violent street protests aimed at ousting her.\n\nThe other four board members include Adul Sangsingkeow, the national police chief under Ms Yingluck's government.\n\nFour of the five who left have links with former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the elder brother of Mr Yingluck, a source at the airline said, declining to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThaksin was removed in an earlier coup in 2006. A military-backed government later re-wrote the constitution to try to limit the political influence of the Shinawatra family.\n\nThe junta's reshuffles within the civil service and its restructuring of the national police force - seen as a bastion of support for Thaksin - are part of efforts to dismantle his support base and ensure parties linked to him do not return to power, analysts say. Air Chief Marshal Prajin said that the restructuring of Thai Airways will proceed in two phases, with the first focusing on boosting the efficiency of services and their quality. Cost-cutting will kick in during the second phase. \"We need to get rid of the excess fat for restructuring,\" he said after a board meeting on Friday.\n\nThe carrier shoulders too many expenses, such as paying taxes for employees who started working for the airline before 2004, Piyasvasti Amranand, a former president of the airline, told Reuters. \"Thai Air has a malicious cancer inside the body,\" he said. \"It has to be cured from the inside.\"\n\nMr Piyasvasti, sacked by Ms Yingluck's government in June 2012, took the helm at the airline in October 2009. The former energy minister was credited for turning around the loss-making carrier, which swung back to a profit in 2009-2012.\n\nSo far, the army-led government has not announced a concrete reform strategy, Mr Piyasvasti said, adding that the recent removal of free air ticket privileges for board members has had little impact on bringing down costs.\n\nFree tickets for board members account for just 3-4 per cent of the company's costs, while 25,000 employee-related expenses make up 15-20 per cent of the total, he said.\n\nA deteriorating bottom line has prompted investors to dump the airline's shares. Thai Airways's market value has dropped by a third in the past year to below US$1 billion.\n\nPassenger traffic plunged 25 percent on year in May when the military seized power. Thai Airways, which has extensive routes to Europe and the rest of Asia, is due to report its earnings for the April-June quarter next month. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM", "images": []}

Even so, service revenue for the first half of the year was up 1.5 per cent at S$412.9 million.\n\nYesterday, the telco also said that the number of subscribers for MiBox, its Internet TV service, had crossed the 10,000 mark - the minimum number that the service needs to qualify as a receiver of cross-carriage content.\n\nM1 said yesterday that it was still in the process of applying for a nationwide TV licence through the Media Development Authority, which is a pre-requisite for cross-carriage. If its application is successful, it will then need to apply to be a qualified receiver of cross-carriage content such as English Premier League and World Cup matches.\n\nFor the second quarter, mobile revenue grew 3.4 per cent to S$167.9 million while revenue from fixed services grew 13.5 per cent to S$17.4 million. International call services revenue, however, fell 19.9 per cent to S$23.7 million.\n\nWithin the mobile segment, second-quarter postpaid revenue grew 5.3 per cent to S$147.6 million, with gross monthly average revenue per user (ARPU) holding steady at S$62.30, unchanged from the second quarter last year. Some 58 per cent of M1's postpaid customers are on tiered data plans, up from 54 per cent in Q1.\n\nM1 CEO Karen Kooi said yesterday that she expects this proportion to \"stabilise\" at about 60-65 per cent.\n\nAs at the second quarter, about 20 per cent of these tiered data users busted their monthly data caps, also an increase from 16 per cent in the previous quarter.\n\nAcquisition cost per postpaid customer was down 19.3 per cent year-on-year, from S$332 to S$268 in Q2, as subscribers held out for premium handsets slated to launch later this year and also as a result of shared mobile plans during the quarter. These plans allow primary subscribers to share voice, data and SMS bundles with subsidiary users, but do not offer subsidised handsets to the latter.\n\nOn the prepaid front, quarterly revenue fell 8.7 per cent to S$20.3 million on a lower prepaid customer base. The operator's prepaid customer base shrank by 130,000 year-on-year to 855,000 because of a regulatory change that lowered the number of prepaid SIM cards an individual could have from 10 to three. This change kicked in on April 1 this year.\n\nM1's fibre customer base continued its upward climb, finishing the second quarter at 94,000 compared to 67,000 a year ago, but its monthly ARPU was 11.4 per cent lower year-on-year at S$41.90.\n\nEarnings per share for the group stood at 4.7 Singapore cents and 9.4 Singapore cents for the quarter and six-month period, respectively, up from 4.3 Singapore cents and 8.7 Singapore cents during the corresponding periods the year before. The group declared a cash interim dividend of seven Singapore cents per share, up from 6.8 cents per share for the same quarter a year ago.\n\nThe operator repeated its expectation of \"moderate growth\" in net profit after tax for 2014. Its counter closed one cent higher at S$3.63 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

During the second quarter, 93,000 sq ft of attributable net lettable area (NLA) were renewed.\n\nWith the early renewals, K-Reit has only 0.7 per cent of its portfolio (by NLA) to be renewed and 6.1 per cent for review for the rest of this year. Ms Ng explained that it is better to play safe, especially with the larger leases, to provide unitholders \"with the security of income and steady cashflow\".\n\nWhile K-Reit is still on the look-out for acquisitions, it has not tabled an offer yet to its sponsor for Marina Bay Financial Centre (MBFC) Tower 3, she disclosed.\n\nFor the first half of this year, K-Reit's DPU dipped 1.8 per cent to 3.87 cents while distributable income grew 3 per cent from a year earlier to S$108.3 million. Net property income grew 18 per cent from a year earlier to S$78.7 million.\n\nAfter divesting its 92.8 per cent stake in Prudential Tower for S$512 million, K-Reit's Singapore portfolio will consist of a 99.9 per cent interest in OFC, one-third interest in MBFC Phase 1 (Towers 1 and 2 and Marina Bay Link Mall), one-third interest in One Raffles Quay and 100 per cent of Bugis Junction Towers.\n\nIn Australia, K-Reit owns five commercial assets, including a 50 per cent interest in a new office tower to be built on the Old Treasury Building site in Perth.

Closed on Mon and Tues.\n\nTHAI food is a little bit like its politics. You have a cacophony of different flavours - sweet, sour, salty, spicy - exploding in your mouth, each wanting to dominate the other until they realise that harmony and balance are the key to tasting really delicious. But what do we know. Maybe there is a reason why you rarely see gaeng phet (red curry) and gaeng leuang (yellow curry) served together on the same dinner table.\n\nHow Thai chefs are able to juggle such disparate flavours into a cohesive whole is what makes the cuisine stand out for its complexity, even if the methods seem deceptively simple. Who can't pound together the requisite ingredients of lemongrass, chilli, shrimp paste and the like into a green curry paste, or turn fish sauce, lime juice and chilli into your garden variety papaya salad dressing?\n\nSo you think. Thai food is the stuff of alchemy - and getting it right is what separates indigenous chefs who've had it built into their DNA, and everyone else.\n\nWe're reminded of this at Soi 60, which gets its creative stamp from Aussie chef Martin Goetz - who spent 13 years at the helm of the two-hatted Longrain in Sydney before packing it in to start a non-Thai food business revolving around his own farm outside the city.\n\nAs consultant chef to Soi 60, he's passed on some of his old recipes to buff up the dining component of this cocktails-plus-food hangout that's prevalent in the hipster scene today. Even in Australia, he's pitched his cooking as modern Thai - which pretty much means that you shouldn't expect the bombastic, gritty, hygiene-challenged authenticity of the original.\n\nAs expected, the food at Soi 60 is tame and civilised - the equivalent of a walk in the Botanic Gardens as opposed to crossing the street at Bangkok's Erawan Shrine without using the overhead bridge. There are no highs, a few lows, and a general sense of ambivalence.\n\nA starter of the traditional Thai miang kham ($13) of betel leaves wrapped with dried shrimp, sweet tamarind sauce, toasted coconut, herbs and ginger is turned into a more luxe, open-faced canap\u00e9. Large betel leaves are carefully arranged with pomelo segments and the usual condiments, topped with a small whole shrimp. Chewy, strong-flavoured dried shrimp leads the flavour parade, followed by the crunch of nuts and the herbal bite of the betel leaves, making for a palatable meal kick-off.\n\nThe faint-hearted will find joy in the papaya salad ($10) which tempers hardcore acidity with sweetness, although the shredded green fruit spiked with mild chilli and its even-tempered dressing also elicits the same non-committal reception.\n\nThere seems to be a deliberate avoidance of extreme flavours, so the tom yum soup ($14) is more tamarind broth-based and easy to enjoy without the usual challenge of keeping your brain in your skull with the unadulterated original. Crisp-fried whole fish ($35) lives up to its description with the textural contrast of crunch and tender flakes of flesh beneath - though it's hard to fully enjoy given its blanket of thick, cloying sweet-sour sauce like a Chinese restaurant cliche trying desperately to assert itself.\n\nWhat hits the spot, though is a hunk of beef short rib on the bone ($30) lovingly slow-cooked in panaeng curry - the mildest of all Thai curries. Although it deviates from Thai convention which dictates that meat be cut into bite-sized pieces so you can't recognise the actual animal, this fork-tender caveman version is vaguely cloying but clocks up points for the rich interplay of spices and coconut cream. It also makes a surprisingly good partner with the green papaya salad which lightens the beef's heft.\n\nWhile we pass on the more fusion likes of sashimi-style tuna and roast duck salad, we can't resist trying the street food staple of pad thai ($22) - a homey if not stellar stir fry of bouncy rice noodles wok-fried in a slightly too-sweet tamarind sauce.\n\nDessert-wise, fusion wins hands down with the wobbly-good coconut panna cotta ($10) amped up with tangy-sweet stewed pineapple that makes this the highlight of the meal. The opposite can be said of the mango sticky rice ($10) - very sweet fresh mango slices done in by a mound of rice that might have tried to be sticky but gave in to its inner desire to be risotto instead. A smear of gula melaka syrup is not appreciated, either.\n\nSoi 60 fills the gap for easy-going Thai that's like the dining equivalent of Muzak. It's safe, not unpleasant, but doesn't linger in the memory. If you want a jolt to the tastebuds, you'll need to run through the real sois (streets) of Bangkok.\n\nRating:\n\n6\n\nWHAT OUR RATINGS MEAN\n\n10: The ultimate dining experience\n\n9-9.5: Sublime\n\n8-8.5: Excellent\n\n7-7.5: Good to very good\n\n6-6.5: Promising\n\n5-5.5: Average\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

On Kairos Watches' website, various models are offered for pre-order at prices ranging from US$549 to US$1,249. The first deliveries are targeted for December.\n\nOn Crowdtivate where the firm is looking to raise S$20,000, Kairos Watches will offer customised units to the people who contribute to the campaign - known as \"backers\".\n\nAnother project, the WaryBee, is a wearable \"smart panic button\" that uses a smartphone app to send the wearer's location information to specific people when it is pushed.\n\nThe S$50,000 that WaryBee's founders are hoping to raise will go towards production tooling and manufacturing the initial batch of hardware, among other things.\n\nCrowdtivate is designed along rewards-based lines, just like other crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter or Indiegogo. S$58, for example, gets a backer a limited-edition WaryBee in anodised red, while S$78 produces a matte white or topaz WaryBee unit.\n\nWhile most of the Crowdtivate projects have fundraising targets of S$3,000 to S$50,000, one of them - Cloudmining.SG - is looking to raise S$150,000, the largest sum of the lot. The two-month-old startup is offering a platform for people to rent servers for Bitcoin mining.\n\nEven as Crowdtivate takes off, there is little chance that Singapore will see its own version of the Kickstarter potato salad - a project posted on the US-based crowdfunding site earlier this month.\n\nThere, a campaign to make some potato salad has bafflingly raised more than US$60,000 from more than 6,000 backers - a development that is possible on a site which only reviews projects to make sure they fit some general criteria.\n\nStarHub and its partners, in contrast, will continue to curate the projects that appear for funding. Organisations such as Home-Fix Experience Centre, the National Book Development Council of Singapore and the NUS Design Incubation Centre are providing mentorship and consulting on the Crowdtivate projects.\n\nThe telco has also formed a partnership with Indonesian operator Indosat, which has begun to work with Indonesian entrepreneurs to put up campaign proposals on Crowdtivate.\n\nWhile other established crowdfunding sites already exist, Crowdtivate could tap a regional market with specific Asian needs.\n\nAmbi Labs, the firm behind Crowdtivate contender Ambi Climate - a device that pairs with air conditioners to manage indoor temperatures - had previously struggled with global crowdfunding sites, according to the firm's founder, Julian Lee. These sites focused on Western lifestyles that tended to feature central air-conditioning instead.\n\n\"We have a very different problem that we're trying to solve here in Asia,\" Mr Lee said. Already, it appears as if Ambi Climate and its promise of a more temperate indoors have struck a sweaty chord. By yesterday evening, the project had raised the most money of the lot - more than S$4,000 of the S$50,000 that it is seeking.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The majority of the units are offered to Japanese investors \"by way of public offer without listing in Japan\", said the trust.\n\nAG Trust intends to distribute 100 per cent of its distributable income to unitholders from the date of listing to March 31, 2015, and at least 90 per cent of its distributable income thereafter.\n\nThis translates to an annual distribution yield of up to 9.1 per cent for the forecast year 2015, and normalised distribution yield (excluding non-recurring items) of up to 7 per cent.\n\nCEO of the trustee-manager Accordia Golf Trust Management Pte Ltd Yoshihiko Machida said: \"AG Trust will provide unitholders with a unique opportunity to invest in a new asset class, providing access and exposure to the Japan golfing market and an acquisition platform that delivers growth opportunities in the golfing sector in Japan.\"\n\nThe Singapore public offering closes at 4pm on Thursday.\n\nAG Trust's initial portfolio comprises of 89 golf courses located across Japan, with 86.4 per cent of the golf courses located in Japan's three largest metropolitan areas. Ten of the golf courses have hotel facilities. Independent real estate appraisers CBRE and Tanizawa have valued the initial portfolio at an aggregate of about 150.91 billion yen (S$1.85 billion) as at Sept 30, 2013.\n\nNet proceeds from the listing will mainly be used to fund the acquisition of the initial portfolio golf courses, which are operated under the Accordia brand, high profitability and attractive yields after value up restructuring by the sponsor, and profits largely derived from operating revenues rather than golf club membership fees.\n\nThe total number of outstanding units immediately after the completion of the offering will be about 1.1 billion units, meaning a market capitalisation of up to about S$1.1 billion.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The compact machine can churn up to 20 pieces of the tortilla-like flat bread each time.\n\nThose who have pre-ordered the gadget will receive it only early next year.

OCBC's forecast was 2.4 per cent.\n\n\"Property prices in Singapore have reacted to curbs in (total) debt servicing ratios, and the slight temporary increase in vehicle quota has dampened car prices. We see this reflected in the moderation of overall inflation expectations,\" Aurobindo Ghosh, co-creator of the SInDEx survey, said of the findings.\n\nSelena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy for OCBC Bank, agreed: \"I'm generally not surprised by the drop in headline inflation expectations, given that the year-to-date consumer price index (CPI) prints have been more subdued compared to market forecasts, and the macro-prudential measures have put a big dampener on domestic asset prices.\"\n\nHowever, she cautioned that core inflation has consistently stayed above 2 per cent (apart from an outsider print of 1.6 per cent year-on-year in February), and the manpower shortfall is likely to pressure the pass-through of labour-intensive services industries into consumer prices.\n\nThe latest decline in inflation expectations is also a result of global economic uncertainty arising from the winding down of bond buying activities and record low unemployment rates in the US, according to the report.\n\nAnd continued global uncertainly - likely caused by supply shocks to oil and gas prices or war - will only adversely impact inflation expectations in the long term, said analysts.\n\n\"There are certainly risks in the near term, for instance, the potential for US and European Union sanctions to push up oil and gas prices, which will feed through into inflation,\" said Michael Wan, economist at Credit Suisse.\n\n\"Nonetheless, these risks seem quite manageable at the moment. Our estimates show that even if oil prices inch up to US$114 per barrel (from US$106 per barrel currently), this should be very comfortable for CPI inflation in the region as a whole. A sustained oil price rise to US$125 per cent barrel will have a much bigger impact,\" he quantified.\n\nBut Francis Tan, economist at UOB Bank, noted that it is difficult to forecast external risks such as war, which can lead to supply shocks to food and oil.\n\n\"What is more certain is the reduced and eventual stop of bond buying activities in the US, which could in fact raise prices rather than lower them.\"\n\nIf the US commits to the tapering of quantitative easing, its economy and demand for consumption and investment will recover, leading to higher nominal interest rates, export prices and eventually, consumer prices, Mr Tan said.\n\nThe SInDEx survey, originally developed by the Singapore Management University's Sim Kee Boon Institute for Financial Economics in collaboration with MasterCard, polled some 400 Singapore individuals to understand the behaviour and sentiments of decision makers in Singapore households.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Apartment towers take far longer to get approved and built, spreading the gains over several years.\n\nThat's inconvenient for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which had hoped housing would be running hotter right now to help offset a cooling mining sector, and only adds to the case for it keeping interest rates at a record low of 2.5 per cent for longer.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Property\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n2\n\nDollar-selling is becoming a bubble, which may burst, HSBC says\n\n3\n\nStocks to watch: SGX, Frasers Centrepoint Trust, NTT DC Reit, BRC Asia\n\n4\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\n5\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/92fce04f56a29a2e84acbedd10be0f958f807e553e632c30fc6ae37b6e3607de?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Looking up: Currently, two high-rise apartments are being built for every five detached houses, which is double the historical rate, says an analyst. -\u00a0PHOTO: BLOOMBERG"}]}

And just how do you bring humanity to the confines of an 2.4-by-12-metre box?\n\nIf the economics work and people actually enjoy living in lovingly repurposed steel husks, the architects on the project have bigger dreams, including floating hundreds of sea container apartments on a barge in the Potomac River and creating a homeless village on the river to serve Georgetown.\n\nFirst, though, things have to go smoothly this week in a booming swath of the District just down the street from Catholic University, where theology graduate Matthew Grace, 31, and his business partner Sean Joiner, 31, are living with the anxiety-inducing results of a decision they made on a snowy day last winter.\n\nInstead of fixing up the aging rental house they bought in 2009 as moonlighting real estate investors, they tore it down.\n\n\"There's not a lot of going back from that,\" Mr Joiner said.\n\n\"You go from something you can rent to a big hole,\" Mr Grace said.\n\nFor years, the young real estate entrepreneurs had been tapping the architectural mind of Mr Grace's fiancee for free: wall colours, building materials, general notions about design. Mr Grace had met Kelly Davies at Catholic and travelled with her and architecture lecturer Travis Price, to Ireland, where Mr Price had taken students on a design expedition he started decades ago.\n\n\"We were building monuments, and we needed hands,\" said Ms Davies, who is now at Mr Price's firm.\n\nWatching her work has helped Mr Grace see the beauty in independent-minded modern architecture.\n\n\"You ever read The Fountainhead?\" Mr Grace asked, referring to the Ayn Rand novel about a rebellious architect's fight against conformists. Mr Price and Ms Davies could be the protagonists. \"They're like the Howard Roark guys,\" Mr Grace said.\n\nMr Grace and Mr Joiner had tried getting into real estate back when they were roommates at Catholic. But it wasn't until the easy-credit housing boom of the mid-2000s that they bought their first rowhouse on Capitol Hill.\n\nThey lived together in the basement, fixed it up and rented out the upstairs, and slowly pieced together a half-dozen properties, which they manage when they're not working their day jobs at a Bethesda financial-planning firm.\n\nAs landlords, they've rented to Catholic's football players and other students, young professionals and others trying to keep up with soaring District rents, they said. They've tried to keep their costs low and avoided being too ambitious in their overhauls.\n\nBut problems with the foundation at their house on Seventh Street NE, just down from the university and a towering new development at the Brookland Metro station, left cracked walls, and they needed to do something big.\n\nThey decided to hire Ms Davies and her boss.\n\nAs Mr Price sketched ideas and cost estimates for remaking the house, \"I was like, 'Stop what you're doing. What is that number?'\" Mr Grace recalled. They couldn't afford it.\n\nThen \"Travis kind of sits back from the table and says, 'How about we do it with shipping containers?'\" They thought it was crazy.\n\nThen they didn't.\n\n\"I wanted to do this since I was in college myself,\" Mr Price said last week.\n\nIn the 70s, as he pondered the question of \"how to solve mass housing\", Mr Price proposed building a 10-storey steel frame for holding sea container homes - \"like a kind of Blade Runner look,\" he said. It was supposed to be \"plug-and-play\", meaning a family could detach the utilities and move. \"You're in a new city in your same house,\" Mr Price said.\n\nHe ended up putting the idea aside in favour of what he thought was a better one: building a \"passive solar house\", which used sunlight and shade to light, heat and partially cool the space inside.\n\nNow, he's reached back into what he calls his \"spiritual backpack\" with a chance to figure out if building a sea container apartment really makes sense. While designers around the world have crafted creative dwellings out of containers in recent years, Mr Price's clients have balked once they have seen the cost of the radical modifications they expect in the simple rectangular structures.\n\nHere, though, \"we're actually using those existing units, and we're not violating them dramatically,\" Mr Price said. \"That makes the difference. You cut and paste. We could be a lot more theatrical, but then you pay.\"\n\nSome longtime Brookland residents view the coming sea container house as part of a broader rush of development that has violated their neighbourhood.\n\nFor Ms Davies and the others behind the SeaUA project - a play on CUA, the abbreviation for Catholic University of America - the container apartment is a chance to make a beautiful and practical improvement to the neighbourhood.\n\nMs Davies and Mr Grace met in Brookland, and Mr Grace has a home there. The questions they ask themselves, Mr Joiner said, are: Would we live here? And would we want our sister to live there? \"It's almost like the golden rule,\" Mr Joiner said.\n\nMs Davies, the project architect, can sound euphoric describing what they've done to try to bring the rusted boxes to life.\n\nWorkers in Baltimore cut steel panels from the containers so there will be open space for a kitchen and living room when the containers are pushed together. The containers will be on three levels, six containers per level, with a cellar unit. Each of the four floors is designed as a single apartment, each with six bedrooms and six bathrooms.\n\nAfter the containers are welded together this week, the remaining construction is scheduled to be competed by the end of August.\n\nIt's an iron deadline.\n\n\"It's more than a want. It's a 'better be' on my end,\" Ms Davies said. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

It also said that it planned to secure more partners from a mix of local and international brands ahead of its opening early next year.\n\nKidZania Singapore will span some 7,600 sq m.\n\nKingsmen's shares rose half a cent to close trading at S$0.92 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

On Oct 9, 2013 and Jan 22, 2014, train services along the East-West Line were disrupted after a train passed a red signal light, damaging a track point in the process.\n\nOn Jan 20, 2014, train services along the North-South Line (NSL) were disrupted when a train stalled between Yio Chu Kang and Ang Mo Kio stations after its on-board battery drained out. The battery had failed to charge up as two circuit breakers on board the incident train were not closed after routine nightly checks by SMRT.\n\nFinally, on May 2, 2014, north-bound train services on the NSL between Yio Chu Kang and Yishun stations were disrupted due to a traction power fault because of SMRT's failure to remove a safety device to prevent electrocution, which had been installed for sleeper replacement works that morning.\n\nAs for SBST, train services on the North-East Line were disrupted on March 21, 2014 and April 6, 2014 due to tripping of the overhead catenary system traction power supply. The first incident was caused by staff error during maintenance work at Potong Pasir station, while the second was due to an aluminium-foil helium balloon that was accidentally released into the station by a passenger. But no action was taken against SBST for the latter incident as it was caused by a passenger.\n\nThe total penalties of S$1.65 million will be donated to the Public Transport Fund to help needy families with transport fares.\n\nSMRT and SBST have 14 days to appeal.\n\nMeanwhile, the LTA said that train service withdrawals across the network have continued to fall from 2013. In particular, the number of train withdrawals for the North-South and East-West Lines, normalised to 100,000 train-km travelled, has dropped to 1.3 by the second quarter this year, compared to 3.3 in 2012 and 2.2 last year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Like other Asian banks, they have stepped into the gaps that opened up when European banks retreated from providing loans in this region.\n\nBut they have to fight entrenched domestic banks. Data shows that despite their years in markets such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, their presence is hardly a challenge to the domestic banks there.\n\nThe market share of local banks in markets such as China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand is between 40 and 60 per cent, a Moody's report this month showed.\n\nUnited Overseas Bank (UOB) and OCBC Bank have made the most progress in Malaysia, where they each hold about 5 per cent market share. DBS Bank does not operate there.\n\nWith scale, bigger domestic banks in Asia enjoy lower funding costs, thanks to a larger and sticky deposit base, which translates to stronger returns than those of second-tier local competitors, Moody's said.\n\nMeanwhile, foreign banks that insist on building a retail presence for access to deposits in Asia must put up with hefty accompanying costs.\n\nAnalysts have also questioned if the universal banking model - where a bank offers a suite of retail services, corporate lending, investment and private banking in several markets - is sustainable amid today's regulatory costs and constraints.\n\nMultinational banks that have gone into these regional markets have failed to challenge the big boys in most jurisdictions in Asia, and have not built scale, according to a Macquarie report in May. \"A main challenge of the Singapore banks is to avoid the most severe mis-steps of the multinational banks.\"\n\nIt noted that for multinational banks, most of the network value and benefits get diluted by cost inefficiencies, regulation and increased complexity.\n\n\"Most often, international expansion is usually about top-line growth story, but it rarely improves the banks' profitability profile. We prefer a strong market position in the home market and manageable exposure to a limited number of overseas markets.\"\n\nAlso, there is a sense that going regional to diversify risk is a strategy that has been worn down.\n\nA Bank for International Settlements (BIS) study in March looked at the banking systems of emerging markets, and noted that \"gains from diversification may be harder to reap if countries' business cycles - and economic shocks - are or become more closely correlated\".\n\nTo be clear, banks in Singapore report a stronger return on equity (ROE) - the income returned as a percentage of equity - than many of their Western peers, whose ROEs are in the single digits.\n\nIn Singapore, the best performer on an ROE basis is UOB, with 12.3 per cent last year.\n\nOne caveat, Macquarie noted, is that Western banks had been reporting inflated ROEs as a result of financial leverage, opportunities for which have been mostly reduced with regulations.\n\nStill, Singapore banks' cost profile as a percentage of income is also lower than that of the Western lenders' operations in Asia, the report said.\n\nUOB will continue to invest in its regional network, but is vigilant on how it uses its balance sheet for growth, said chief financial officer Lee Wai Fai.\n\nThis means being selective in extending credit to the banks' target client segments to keep a strong liability base. \"Rather than compete in all markets at a domestic level, we look to invest to support our customers' regional ambitions.\"\n\nStill, a branch network ensures that its regional subsidiaries are self-sufficient with local currency funding, given the capital controls across the region, said Mr Lee. \"With more intra-regional trade and rising incomes from Asia's middle class, clients are looking for banking partners who can support them across the region in their business expansion as well as personal wealth management.\"\n\nThe bank will further diversify its funding sources, particularly as Basel III rules on banks' liquidity coverage kick in, and will look at debt, he added.\n\nA DBS spokeswoman said that DBS's focus in the rest of Asia is on corporate banking, SME banking and wealth management. The bank's S$200 million investment in digital banking will help alleviate the pressure of building a bigger retail presence in Asia, she said.\n\n\"If we are able to deliver superior banking services digitally, we will be able to gain access to large retail markets outside Singapore while obviating the need for traditional branches and expensive points of presence.\"\n\nOCBC chief financial officer Darren Tan said that the bank has access to stable low-cost customer deposits in the retail and corporate segments.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They had explored doing so in Australia, Hong Kong and even Malaysia.\n\nBut Mr Kwan thinks the firm needs to be bigger.\n\n\"In my view, (the firm has to hit revenues of) at least S$250 million to S$300 million so that you can really swing with the boys over in markets like Malaysia, Japan and China.\"\n\nAlready, the group has 450 retail points in Singapore. It operates another 64 restaurants, of which 18 are overseas in countries such as Malaysia, China and the Middle East.\n\nHe noted that while the group is poised to expand further overseas, the move to get listed will also facilitate such plans.\n\n\"We really have not capitalised on the credibility that the Singapore government has built, to take it really internationally and globally.\n\n\"In our previous business, we were in some 31 countries and we had something like 1,200 franchisees around the world. We think we can do at least that, if not more, in the food space.\"\n\nAnd doing more is exactly what Mr Kwan has in mind.\n\nFor the past six months, the company has been in talks with an international Swiss group comprising medical doctors on a joint-venture to develop functional foods - foods that are not just healthy but purposefully consumed, such as those that are cardio-friendly.\n\nDiscussions are also ongoing between the company and an Australian group \"to offer convenient food that is highly nutritious\".\n\nExpressing excitement over these ideas which he described as \"exportable\", Mr Kwan said that the aim is to be able to deliver foods with high nutrition to the consumer's doorstep, without them having to cook.\n\nHe pointed out that there is a ready market and it is \"as large as a quarter\" of Singapore's population, but Mr Kwan added that these plans will take a bit more time to realise if they want to get it right.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is a drop from 4.7 Singapore cents a year ago.\n\nEarlier this month, the Reit inked conditional agreements to acquire three properties in Kuala Lumpur, Xi'an and Wuhan which it had said together will boost its FY13 DPU by 1.2 per cent to 8.81 Singapore cents on a pro forma basis.\n\nAt yesterday's analyst and media briefing, Ronald Tay, CEO of the Reit manager, said: \"Contributions from the China and Malaysia properties will come through sometime in August, so we will have at least four months of contribution this fiscal year.\"\n\nWhen asked about his acquisition and fund-raising plans for the rest of the year, Mr Tay said that since the Reit's gearing will effectively rise to 40 per cent following the completion of the three latest purchases, any further acquisition will most likely have to be funded by a mix of both debt and equity.\n\n\"Obviously the numbers will have to stack up before we can make any significant acquisitions, (but) we will try to manage our timing a little better to manage the dilutive effects of any fund-raising,\" he said.\n\nThe hospitality Reit's revenue rose 14 per cent to S$88.1 million due to contributions of S$9.4 million from new properties acquired in 2013 and 2014, as well as stronger contribution from existing properties. Its gross profit climbed 14 per cent to S$46.5 million.\n\nSingapore as a market did not perform well in Q2, with revenue falling 10 per cent to S$6.6 million and gross profit sliding 16 per cent to S$3.1 million. Revenue per available unit (RevPAU) fell 9 per cent to S$207 on lower demand from project groups.\n\nBut Mr Tay noted that this seems to be turning around in Q3, with its properties - Ascott Raffles Place, Somerset Liang Court and Citadines Mount Sophia - trading above 90 per cent in July. \"On a full-year basis, Singapore's performance will probably be a bit flat to slightly positive,\" he said.\n\nHe highlighted Australia as a market that will continue to be difficult going forward. Already, it suffered in Q2, with revenue falling 8 per cent to A$1.2 million, while gross profit plunged 20 per cent to A$400,000 and RevPAU fell 7 per cent to A$145. The Citadines St Georges Terrace Perth is Ascott Reit's only property there.\n\n\"In Western Australia, the main industry is really oil and gas and mining which continue to struggle on the back of sluggish demand, so that has affected the performance of our property in Q2,\" Mr Tay said.\n\n\"Unfortunately, I think Australia will continue to be under pressure this year. Everybody's hoping that the government will repeal the Carbon Tax - a big thing that all the mining companies are looking for. But that's still a big if.\"\n\nThe Reit in its latest annual report also mentioned a review of the Super Mining Tax which will unlock many projects that have been warehoused and will help in stimulating the mining industry and activating new developments. For now, Mr Tay said that Australia, being quite small in the Reit's portfolio, will not materially affect its overall performance.\n\nAs for Indonesia, he said that if Jakarta governor Joko Widodo wins the presidential election, it is likely to attract more foreign direct investments (FDI) into the country. \"We focus on corporate travellers, so a good leading indicator for us in our world is typically GDP and FDI. If there is an improvement in both, that would directly translate into better operating performance or demand for our properties,\" he said.\n\nFor its first half, the Reit's revenue and gross profit both rose 15 per cent to S$168.5 million and S$85.7 milllion respectively.\n\nIn the stock market, the counter rose 0.5 Singapore cent to S$1.265 yesterday before its results were announced.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Ukraine made the changes on Monday, the same day a Ukrainian AN-26 military cargo plane was destroyed by a missile while flying at 21,000 feet. Russia followed with similar restrictions effective at midnight on Wednesday, hours before Flight 17 took off from Amsterdam.\n\nThe decision by government officials to restrict the airspace, rather than close it completely, raised unanswered questions.\n\nThe attack on the cargo plane, American and Ukrainian officials said, indicated that a more powerful missile than those previously fired in the conflict had been used. These missiles, including SA-11s, SA-17s and SA-20s, can readily strike aircraft at standard cruising altitudes for commercial passenger jets, changing the nature of the menace to civilian aviation.\n\nBut the new restrictions underestimated the risks to a startling degree, aviation officials said, leaving Flight 17 exposed at 33,000 feet to missiles known to fly to more than twice that height. Officials in the United States said on Friday that the jet, with 298 people aboard, was most likely downed by an SA-11, which carries a large high-explosive warhead at roughly three times the speed of sound. Variants of the missile can hit targets at altitudes exceeding 70,000 feet, according to IHS Jane's, a defence consultancy.\n\nMalaysia Airlines flight dispatchers, who draft flight plans, and the jetliner's crew, which followed the plan provided them from Kuala Lumpur, observed the restrictions imposed by Russia and Ukraine, according to European aviation authorities and the airline.\n\nOne European aviation official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the airspace restrictions set by Russia and Ukraine were inadequate, but the airline dispatchers still had the option of plotting routes around the conflict area.\n\n\"The general feeling is that if the airspace is closed to 32,000 feet, the last thing I am going to do is fly at 33,000,\" he said. \"We wouldn't have gone anywhere near it once we knew they were shooting things out of the sky.\"\n\nAt a news conference in Kuala Lumpur, Liow Tiong Lai, Malaysia's transport minister, said that the aircraft had been following a safe route that Malaysia Airlines had used for years and, through Thursday, was still used by several Asian and European airlines. \"During that period of time, there are also many other aircraft using the same route,\" he noted.\n\nPrime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia pointed out earlier in the day that the International Civil Aviation Organization had kept the flight corridor open, the International Air Transport Association had not restricted travel in Ukrainian airspace, and European air traffic control officials had continued to direct flights through the area. Malaysia Airlines came up with a flight plan within air traffic control parameters, but air traffic control agencies said they did not play an extensive role in evaluating it.\n\nSergei V Izvolsky, the spokesman for the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency, said that it was not up to Russia to give recommendations to foreign air carriers regarding the flight routes for their planes. \"They make up their flight plans and coordinate them with their information services,\" Mr Izvolsky added.\n\nAnother aviation industry official said that restricting the airspace, rather than closing it, implied that the route was safe even when it was not. \"Airlines depend on governments and air traffic control authorities to advise which airspace is available for flight, and they plan within those limits,\" Tony Tyler, the director general of the International Air Transport Association in Geneva, said.\n\nNico Voorbach, president of the European Cockpit Association, a regional pilot's union, said: \"We have to be able to rely on the information we have from security agencies, governments and national civil aviation authorities. They are normally in a better position to judge if it's safe.\"\n\nMalaysia Airlines issued a statement on Friday saying it had filed a flight plan to cross the area at 35,000 feet, only to be told by Ukrainian air traffic controllers that the plane should maintain an altitude of 33,000 feet. Either elevation was above the restriction, but within range of an SA-11.\n\nA European aviation official confirmed the change to the flight plan. \"That was in accordance with normal air traffic control procedures,\" said Brian Flynn, the head of network management and external relations with Eurocontrol, the Brussels-based agency that coordinates air traffic in the region. \"It would not have been considered unusual.\"\n\nBased on the radar data, Flight 17 was steady at 33,000 feet at the time of the attack and was on track to stay at that level, Mr Flynn said.\n\nHe said that airspace restrictions were introduced by Ukraine on July 1, initially restricting flights below 26,000 feet, and did not have much effect on the volume of air traffic over the area, indicating that many carriers considered the route safe. Before June 30, around 400 daily flights passed through the area at all altitudes, he said. After the first set of restrictions, traffic dropped by a few dozen flights per day. When the restriction was extended to 32,000 feet on July 14, the daily traffic decreased only about 50 flights from a month earlier, a reduction of around 12 per cent.\n\nThe majority of air traffic crossing the area where Flight 17 was struck consists of international overflights that were already at cruising altitude and would not be required to adjust their normal routes to accommodate the new restrictions. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM", "images": []}

After all, we are strongest at the broken places and after a defeat, it is said.\n\nBut what was Khazanah Nasional thinking when it said it would come up with a revival plan for MAS within six to 12 months - following the loss of MH370 on March 8, which led to a reputational fallout, and amid slumping sales and hefty compensation payouts and the worst January-March quarterly loss in two years.\n\nThe controlling shareholder doesn't seem to realise that MAS is in dire straits. It simply had no time to lose.\n\nMAS had some RM3.4 billion (S$1.3 billion) in the kitty as at end-March, but which was fast depleting on the back of a worryingly high daily cash burn rate of RM5 million.\n\nEmbattled MAS chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya had promised sweeping and radical changes operationally and financially to reset the flag carrier. Not many were holding their breath as neither MAS's top management led by Mr Ahmad Jauhari - a good guy but evidently, not the right one for the beleaguered airline - nor Khazanah seemed to have the wherewithal to steer the carrier's recovery.\n\nTrimming the state-controlled airline's bloated staff force and cutting some routes were deemed inevitable but they were unpopular and hard decisions no one wanted to make, partly due to the potential political backlash as well as protests by the airline's vociferous trade unions.\n\nAt the heart of the unions' opposition is that employees should keep their pay cheques for as long as lucrative and lopsided procurements dished out to cronies - a legacy issue yet to be tackled - and perceived extravagance among senior management persist and these costly leakages are not plugged.\n\nBut now, after the MH17 catastrophe, when the ill-fated plane was shot out of the sky by a sophisticated missile over Ukraine's troubled airspace, everything has changed.\n\nFor one, the timeline for the airline to start working on a recovery plan reflects more urgency - one week to have a rough sketch and about a month to beat the plan into shape.\n\nMr Ahmad Jauhari's term at the helm of the airline ends in mid-September, which would lead to a much-needed top management shake-up to light up the carrier's recovery. The plan to spin off and list MAS's profitable businesses such as MAS Engineering, Firefly and MASwings could finally see the light of day, while privatising MAS, not a widely preferred route, still remains an option. None of these are out-of-the-box solutions but they are long overdue.\n\nThe twin catastrophes have turned MAS's shortcomings, earlier a source of bitter discontent and stinging criticisms, now somewhat more forgiving and this in a way, could lift public angst over MAS while it beats a path to recovery.\n\nFrom hereon, MAS's rehabilitation, if it bears fruit, will no longer be a mundane, text-book narrative of how a state-controlled airline, known for its problems and mired in red ink, managed to turn around amid a tough and competitive business environment. Instead, it would be an against-all-odds account of how an airline, hammered by harsh crosswinds of disaster in five months, found renewed will to stay afloat and, by doing so, turned a story of destruction into survival.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Then it stayed on the charts for months after, proving it wasn't a flash in the pan.\n\nToday, Angry Birds has been downloaded more than a whopping two billion times - making it bigger than titles from other entertainment media like movies and music, pointed out Peter Vesterbacka, Rovio Entertainment's chief marketing officer.\n\nInstantly recognisable as its flagship, Angry Birds is certainly Rovio's Mickey Mouse, he said, but it'll be some time before Rovio gets to be a multi-brand house like Disney.\n\n\"Everything in due time,\" Mr Vesterbacka said, adding that Rovio is staying focused on Angry Birds but has also launched other titles like Bad Piggies: a spinoff of the villains in the Angry Birds series.\n\nBad Piggies, launched in 2012, was an experimental step in a different direction by not leading with the Angry Birds brand. But Rovio was careful not to depart too far from its leading characters.\n\nThe experiment proved successful: Bad Piggies hit the No 1 spot on Apple store's paid charts, and subsequently received good ratings on online gaming sites.\n\nBut the experiment highlighted what might happen to Rovio if it moved too far from its Angry Birds core. Just prior to Bad Piggies, Rovio released a game called Amazing Alex. While the game managed to hit the top of the charts because of the Rovio name, it failed to stay there, tumbling to 73rd spot on the top-100 list after just two months.\n\nPointing back to Disney, Mr Vesterbacka said that Mickey Mouse is iconic for the brand, but over time it has been able to own and grow other huge names, such as the Star Wars franchise. Star Wars wasn't grown out of Disney organically, but came into Disney's stable via its acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012.\n\n\"Disney is a good role model, and we want to learn from the best,\" he insisted. \"In due time, we will launch other franchises.\"\n\nFor now, there remains much potential in the Angry Birds formula.\n\nHalf of Rovio's 2013 revenue of US$216 million was brought in by licensing products such as lunch boxes and toys.\n\nThe company also reported a 50 per cent drop in its profit, to US$37 million last year, which it said was due to investments made in new business areas such as animation and video distribution, in order to continue expanding the Angry Birds brand.\n\nMr Vesterbacka also pointed to this: \"We launched an animated series - Angry Birds Toons - in March last year, and our (2011) purchase of an animation studio, Kombo, gave us the biggest one in north Europe.\"\n\nThe company has managed to distribute its \"toons\" to all 1.3 billion players in its network, by cross-promoting the animated series within the game, he added.\n\nHe was clear on Rovio's profit objectives: \"We just want to be able to offer more ways for people to spend money on Angry Birds, whether it's physical or digital.\"\n\nAnd later this year, Rovio plans to launch another Angry Birds spinoff called Angry Birds Stella. This is based on gameplay similar to the Angry Birds series, but has a dollhouse within that users can stock with items. It's planning to pitch the game to young girls aged 6-9 years.\n\n\"It represents what we've been doing with Angry Birds - keeping it fresh with new animations, new games all the time.\"\n\nThe company doesn't break down its revenue, but Mr Vesterbacka said the US remains Rovio's biggest market for now. Still, Asia's large emerging markets of India and Indonesia, especially, hold promise for the next phase of growth for Rovio, as these markets quickly warm to smartphones, he noted.\n\nRovio has about 800 employees, with about 600 of those in Helsinki. Shanghai was its first office outside Finland, and it later opened up other offices in Seoul, Tokyo, Shanghai and Santa Monica, California.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A locomotive had been put at the head of the train, which one worker said would be sent southwest to an undisclosed location. Western officials have voiced concern about the handling of the remains of the 298 people killed when the airliner crashed on Thursday and the Dutch foreign minister has said his country is \"furious\" to hear bodies were being \"dragged around\".\n\nAfter lying there for two days in the summer heat, by yesterday the bodies had been removed from a large swathe of the crash site, leaving only bloodstained military stretchers along the side of the road.\n\nSergei Kavtaradze, a senior official of the pro-Russian rebels' self-proclaimed Donetsk People's republic, said all 196 of the bodies found so far had been loaded into the wagons in Torez, an eastern town in the Donetsk region. \"They will stay there for now, until the issue (of what to do with them) is resolved. We are waiting for the experts,\" he told Reuters, saying he did not understand why the experts had been delayed. \"We've been waiting for the experts for three days.

All three Singapore banks have a branch in the SFTZ, with DBS the first among the three to begin operations at its sub-branch there in January.\n\nBoth UOB and DBS have announced trade-financing loans to Chinese firms since their SFTZ sub-branches began their operations.\n\nUnder Chinese rules, offshore yuan can already flow into the zone, provided the money is meant for activities such as trade.\n\nBut having the account offers additional, and specific, perks, BT understands. For one, the account allows offshore yuan to be used to pay off loans made on the mainland; given the better offshore borrowing rates, a company with operations in the SFTZ can choose to service the more expensive debt first with money borrowed from offshore.\n\nThe account can also be used by non-resident individuals working in the SFTZ, a PBOC circular showed. This means they can invest in China in a personal capacity.\n\nThe Chinese banks have already received permission to open these trade accounts, which were made available only in May.\n\nThe foreign banks understand that the Chinese banks had a head start because their systems already matched the PBOC's. Those banks are also expected to be used to test the overall strength of the SFTZ structure.\n\nAll of these are steps towards liberalising China's capital market, even as the PBOC noted that \"efforts will be made to improve macro-prudential regulation over all kinds of foreign debts\".\n\nIn response to queries, a DBS spokeswoman noted that the SFTZ was a \"testing ground for economic reform\".\n\n\"DBS Bank (China)'s FTZ sub-branch is now working on developing its free trade account system according to PBOC's requirements,\" she said.\n\n\"The FTZ is a pilot and the focus is on innovation in step with regulatory changes. Our development of the FTZ business is in step with the pace of regulatory reforms, and the FTZ will evolve steadily and gradually, which is the stated intent of the pilot.\"\n\nOCBC China's head of business banking Roy Tan said that since the opening of its Shanghai sub-branch in the FTZ in June, it has formed a task force to work on getting the necessary approvals for the permit.\n\n\"Receiving the permit will allow our SFTZ sub-branch to broaden the existing range of specialised financial solutions to include cross-border settlement and financing products and services.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The so-called BRICS group of nations - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - that launched the project last week will have an equal say in the bank's and the reserve fund's affairs. The Contingent Reserve Arrangement will have US$100 billion to head off potential economic volatility, most immediately perhaps with problems linked to the winding down of the US Federal Reserve's stimulus policy.\n\nThe desire for an international lending agency independent of the West goes back a few decades. For instance, there was fierce criticism of the World Bank and the IMF during the 1997 East Asian financial crisis as it became clear that the two Bretton Woods institutions were bent on pushing the \"Washington Consensus\". The IMF would only proffer emergency funds contingent on recipients agreeing to deregulate their economy, an idea touted in those days by the Washington establishment as a remedy for all economic ills. Then, the Bretton Wood twins took to regularly upbraiding nations that resorted to capital controls or held fast to their sovereign right to maintain an industrial policy.\n\nThere has also been resentment over the governance of the Bretton Woods institutions. Always, the World Bank was headed by an American and the IMF by a European. The voting structure of both institutions remains heavily tilted towards the West. Governance reforms have been much discussed but little has really changed.\n\nRussia and, to a lesser degree, China and India, have also been vexed with Washington's use of the US dollar as an intrument of its foreign policy. America's use of the dollar for political ends goes all the way back to the 1956 Suez crisis. More recently, BNP Paribas was fined US$9 billion for violating US sanctions on Sudan. The display of the reach of US law enforcement agencies has unsettled many countries.\n\nNevertheless, the new BRICS institutions will operate with the US dollar. But the eventual intent to cut off what has come to be called America's \"exhorbitant privilege\" as owner of the world's reserve currency, seems clear. So, the idea behind the move is the creation of institutions that will cut dependence on the West and create a more multi-polar world financially.\n\nThe BRICS group represents 42 per cent of the world's population and about 20 per cent of the world's economy. Total trade among the countries is worth US$6.14 trillion, or nearly 17 per cent of the world's total. They also account for 11 per cent of global capital investment. It remains to be seen how much difference the new institutions will make in the world. At the very least, it must be hoped that the BRICS institutions will avoid the recent mistakes of the Bretton Wood twins.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Bids for the proposal are due today.\n\nThe No 1 search provider is stepping up efforts to provide digital access in the US and around the world as it seeks to get more consumers on the Internet, benefiting its own user and ad services. The company, which is working towards rolling out broadband services in several US cities, already provides wireless access in Mountain View and New York's Chelsea neighbourhood, where it has an office.\n\nKelly Mason, a spokeswoman for Google, declined to comment. Other companies that attended the presentation were Cisco Systems, IBM and Samsung.\n\nThe project calls for new designs to replace pay phones, providing \"advertising, Wi-Fi and phone services\" in all five boroughs. While the companies can charge for phone service, except for calls to emergency numbers, they cannot charge a fee for Internet access, a document said. There are more than 7,300 pay phones in the city.\n\nThe Wi-Fi stations will be located in the city's most densely trafficked corridors, with revenue generated by advertising on their side panels, according to the city's request for proposals. Of the 4,325 pay phone locations that already have advertising side panels, about two-thirds are in Manhattan, 15 per cent in Queens, 12 per cent in Brooklyn, 6 per cent in the Bronx and a small number in Staten Island. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Technology\n\nSingapore ranks among top cities for tech talent as AI job listings surge globally: report\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:37 AM\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

If you are a fitness buff, with a connected wristband, you can keep track of your activity level, watch your progress over time and compare your performance with others.\n\nBut this, the experts say, is only the tip of the iceberg. If this year's consumer technology events are any indication, the Internet of Things (IoT) and wearable computing are about to go mainstream in a big way.\n\nThese new technologies won't just make our daily lives more convenient and homes more automated, they will change the way we work as well. The Asia-Pacific market for IoT could be worth as much as US$100 billion over the next few years, depending on which analyst report you view.\n\nSo what does this all mean for the data centre landscape? All that data will need somewhere to go. According to Cisco, there will be upwards of 50 billion connected devices worldwide by 2020. All these devices will generate huge amounts of data which will end up in, or passing through, data centres.\n\nIoT data won't purely be the concern of companies that provide IoT products and services or their ecosystem of partners and suppliers - it will affect every government or private organisation that adopts IoT or machine-to-machine or wearable technologies to improve operations.\n\nIn a report published recently, analyst firm IDC expects IoT technology and services revenue worldwide to grow from US$4.8 trillion in 2012 to US$7.3 trillion by 2017. The report notes that the greatest opportunity will initially be in the consumer, discrete manufacturing and government vertical industries.\n\nThe same trends are expected to be mirrored in Asia, with smart cities, intelligent utilities, metros, homes and cars, as well as wearable devices all contributing to the mix. But many verticals will see growing adoption of IoT. Organisations will thus need to think carefully about how they will manage and where they will put all of this valuable data.\n\nData security will be a primary concern as connected devices proliferate. Certain types of data or devices will be relatively innocuous, such as the egg carton that tells you when you're out of eggs. After all, how much damage could scammers really do if they accessed that data or hacked the egg carton? But the damage done if hackers accessed other types of IoT devices or data could be quite significant.\n\nI suspect that many enterprises will be more comfortable keeping their own IoT data safely tucked away within their own data centre or private cloud, but in other cases, putting it on the public cloud will be perfectly suitable.\n\nAs more of the physical world is connected, any down time will also create more frustration, or worse. Think about how frustrated we all get when email or even Twitter is down briefly. But when an M2M (machine to machine) system in a manufacturing plant goes down temporarily, or cash withdrawals are affected at an ATM overseas, the productivity loss could be more acute.\n\nA significant amount of the value of connected devices will come from analysing all the data these devices produce. This will drive the need for powerful computers and big data analytics to crunch the data the devices spew out. These systems will require space, power, cooling and connectivity to get the job done.\n\nIoT data will be highly dynamic, too. The continuous flow of data will often be shared with an ecosystem of partners or packaged with content to deliver different types of services. Or it will be combined with other data to create new insights. As such, the need for direct and secure access to partners and suppliers will drive the need for a range of connectivity options.\n\nFor certain applications, latency will also be a concern. Lag time, for example, could create a disorienting effect for users of wearable devices such as Google Glass. In those situations where latency is a factor, organisations will need to put their data and computing infrastructure in close proximity to users and the devices, and be able to connect directly to their trading partners and digital supply chain.\n\nSupply squeeze\n\nIoT initiatives will leverage a combination of public cloud, private cloud and enterprise data centres. Regardless of the mix, it is conceivable that the trend will contribute to a squeeze on the supply of data centre and cloud resources, particularly in areas near large population centres, major metro areas or even industrial and manufacturing hubs, where data centre space is already at a premium.\n\nWhile it is still too early to tell exactly how the IoT story will unfold over the next few years, one thing is clear: data centres will play a critical role. Any IoT initiative will require a tailored data centre strategy that balances current needs with future growth and potential applications involving governments, private enterprise and even consumers. Chief information officers will, therefore, need to think carefully about their data centre strategy to ensure it provides the flexibility, scalability, security, availability and connectivity that the emerging IoT trend will demand.\n\nThe writer is chief technology officer of Digital Realty\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Thai Airways reportedly expects flight delays of up to half an hour for flights to and from Europe.\n\n\"At this point, we are no longer using Ukrainian airspace and have re-routed all our flights to alternative flight paths that are away from the region,\" said an SIA spokesman. The airline immediately made the changes after the MH17 incident on Thursday.\n\nOther Asia-Pacific carriers - such as Korean Air, Asiana, Qantas Airways, Cathay Pacific and China Airlines - had started avoiding the airspace over eastern Ukraine months ago when Russia marched into Crimea, raising questions as to why other carriers hadn't followed suit.\n\nBut airline bodies International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), International Air Transport Association (Iata) as well as European air traffic regulator Eurocontrol have stepped forward to point out that the flight path adopted by MH17 was not subject to restrictions.\n\nReacting to news of the Boeing 777 aircraft going down, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak stressed that MH17's flight route was declared safe by United Nations' aviation body ICAO.\n\nKuala Lumpur-bound MH17 was flying at 33,000 feet when it fell off the radar, a level which was open at the time as Ukrainian authorities had only closed the route from ground to 32,000 feet, said Eurocontrol.\n\nSince the crash, the Ukrainian authorities have closed off routes from the ground up to unlimited altitude, effectively declaring it a no-fly zone.\n\nWhile National University of Singapore (NUS) professor Ted Hopf reckons that altering flight paths by a few hundred kilometres to bypass Ukrainian airspace shouldn't add significantly to the fuel bill for carriers, he also noted that the price of fuel could go up given simultaneous crises in Iraq, Gaza and Syria.\n\nBrent crude futures rose to nearly US$108 per barrel in the wake of the MH17 crash. UOB Kay Hian analysts said SIA and Cathay Pacific have hedged most of their fuel requirements for the year, however, which could help insulate them from a spike in fuel prices. Prof Hopf also said it would be difficult for carriers to avoid flying over all hotspots as it means \"having to avoid large swathes of the globe\". Still, Korean Air Lines Co announced plans to suspend all flights to Tel Aviv over the next week to address flight safety concerns as Israel mounted a ground offensive in the Gaza Strip.\n\nUOB Kay Hian analysts reckon that visitor arrivals from Europe to South-east Asia - which already have taken a hit in the wake of flight MH370's disappearance in March - could fall as a result of this latest tragedy, translating to lower passenger loads for South-east Asian carriers.\n\n\"A greater portion of the sector's air travel will now transit via the Middle Eastern or Turkish hubs,\" they wrote in a report.\n\nAlicia Seah, director of marketing and communications for Dynasty Travel, told BT that Europe-bound travellers are concerned that airfares could rise if higher fuel costs are passed onto consumers, especially during the current peak travel season. While there is no indication of this at present, Ms Seah noted fares could rise in future if fuel surcharges trend higher.\n\nMeanwhile, Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said yesterday that there have been no reports of Singaporeans on MH17 at this point.\n\nMAS has released a list of the 298 passengers and crew by nationality, which included 189 Dutch passengers, 44 Malaysians and 27 Australians at last update. Four of the 298 have yet to be verified by MAS as they were transit passengers who boarded the plane in Amsterdam.\n\nSeven passengers onboard MH17 were bound for Singapore, via Kuala Lumpur, BT understands.\n\n\"MFA remains in close contact with MAS and the relevant airport authorities to ascertain the nationality of the unverified passengers,\" the MFA said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

After dropping slightly into the red, the Straits Times Index yesterday managed a net rise of 3.64 points to a new 52-week high of 3,310.53. This brings its gain for the week to 17 points or 0.5 per cent.\n\nTurnover has been poor for many months now and yesterday's 1.5 billion units worth S$819 million was the seventh consecutive day that dollar business was under S$1 billion. Excluding warrants there were 191 rises against 207 falls.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday dropped 161 points or 0.9 per cent to 16,976 and the S&P 500 lost 1.2 per cent to 1,958 after news of the crash reminded markets that Ukrainian political instability is very much a worry that until now has been brushed aside as inconsequential.\n\nUS news reports also mentioned Israel's offensive in Gaza and Hamas's retaliatory rocket strikes on Israel as factors behind the selling.\n\nHere, United Overseas Bank has been the main blue chip in play throughout the week, with DBS and the Jardine group in supporting roles. UOB was queried by the Singapore Exchange (SGX) a week ago and after it replied that it did not know why its shares were in play, SGX issued a Trade With Caution notice. The stock yesterday bounced 10 cents to S$23.65; over the five days it lost 38 cents or 1.6 per cent.\n\nIn the second line, Jaya Holdings was queried by SGX on the unusual trading volume in its shares and, like UOB last week, received a Trade With Caution notice after it replied that it could not explain the unusual activity.\n\nJaya's shares fell 0.4 Singapore cents to 7.3 cents yesterday with 142 million traded. Formerly a shipping firm, Jaya is now a shell company after selling its business to Mermaid Marine Australia in June.\n\nOn the domestic front, the main news yesterday was that non-oil domestic exports (NODX) contracted 4.6 per cent year-on-year last month, after falling 6.6 per cent in May.\n\nIn its Daily Breakfast Spread yesterday, DBS Group Research asked why exports have been so disappointing and said the reason is that most people probably had been too optimistic about the global recovery, particular in the US.\n\n\"And when growth momentum slumped in the first quarter, the blame was on the bad weather,\" said DBS. \"As it appears now, the recovery was never strong and probably will remain slow in the coming quarters. With such an outlook on the US, one can't reasonably expect a strong performance in Singapore's exports. This is further compounded by the fact that the Eurozone is unlikely to offer much respite and that China has decided to grow slower this year.\"\n\nIn its Rates Strategy yesterday, Rabobank said the airplane disaster and the situation in Gaza raise the clear risk of a spike in geopolitical tensions and a move to the highest quality assets.\n\n\"As noted in one of our comments earlier in the week, this bid for safe-haven assets could replace the anaesthetic of central bank stimulus if the latter were to recede. . .'' said the bank.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Lobster rolls are the gourmet fast food du jour. Essentially a butter-griddled hot dog bun stuffed with cold mayonnaise-coated lobster meat chunks, the luxe snack drew three hour-long queues when lobster-only Duxton eatery Pince and Pints opened its doors a fortnight ago.

The others on trial are Ms Ho's husband, senior pastor and co-founder Kong Hee, deputy senior pastor Tan Ye Peng, finance manager Sharon Tan, and former finance manager and board member Serina Wee.\n\nLam's lawyer, Senior Counsel Kenneth Tan, had said in his opening statement on Monday that Lam had played a much smaller role than the others in the transactions in question: \"All John Lam is, is a volunteer . . . he seems to pop out here and there.\"\n\nBut, under cross-examination by the prosecution yesterday, Lam admitted to being involved in all major decisions of the church.\n\nChief prosecutor Mavis Chionh produced a transcript of an extraordinary general meeting held by CHC on July 7, 2007; at that meeting, Kong had described Lam, head of the church's investment committee, as being \"very qualified\" and who has \"been with us in every major decision we've made from Day 1\".\n\nMs Chionh asked Lam if it was correct to say he had been with the church in every major decision made from Day 1.\n\n\"Yes, I can agree with that,\" Lam replied.\n\nShe showed minutes of other meetings - one in March 2010 with the church's executive members, at which he addressed accusations made against Kong; at another meeting months later, he presented audit findings to the executive members.\n\n\"When we look at (these), the history of your involvement in the church, the key appointments you have held, the responsibilities you have held, it is clear that you are not just an ordinary member who happens to 'pop in and out' of the church,\" Ms Chionh said.\n\nLam disagreed, saying: \"My statement, and as my counsel has said, regarding this case, my position has always been (that I) popped in and out . . . I'm not disagreeing that I'm qualified, that I have experience, but I am an ordinary volunteer.\"\n\nHe also asserted that entities such as Xtron, while aligned with CHC's objectives, were independent.\n\nBut Ms Chionh put it to him: \"(On Thursday), you were the one who told us that (CHC senior pastor Kong Hee) wanted the directors of all these companies listed to be responsible for the running of their company . . . If these companies are all independent of the church, why should Mr Kong, as pastor of the church, be in a position to say that he wants the directors to be made responsible for the running of the companies?\"\n\nShe produced evidence showing the church's role in the running of these companies - in particular, Xtron. The court was shown a document listing individuals whom Lam, Wee, Chew and Tan Ye Peng suggested to Kong and the CHC board as being suitable directors for the \"independent\" companies.\n\nShe also produced another document on the agreement between Xtron and CHC on CHC's subleasing of Singapore Expo Hall 8 from Xtron, for which Xtron did not charge the church a mark-up for renting the Expo space.\n\n\"Assuming Xtron is an independent commercial entity that deals with the church at arm's length, why is it that it would not charge any mark-up on the rental of Expo?\" she asked.\n\nLam said he believed there was a mark-up provided for in the sub-leasing agreement. Ms Chionh then produced another document: an e-mail from Wee to senior church members which said a CHC board meeting had decided CHC would pay Xtron a mark-up, \"as only then will it be deemed an arm's length transaction\"; the e-mail also carried Wee's calculations on how the mark-up was to be done.\n\n\"Do you have any explanation as to why, if Xtron is an independent commercial entity, . . . is Serina (Wee), the church's finance manager, proposing in this e-mail how much mark-up Xtron should charge CHC for renting the Expo premises? It doesn't make sense for the church, if it is dealing at arm's length with Xtron, a commercial entity, to say, 'Hey, I want to pay you more rent than you are now charging me. Please, can I pay you more rent?' You would expect Xtron to be the one to propose a rental mark-up. Do you agree?\"\n\nLam, not answering the question directly, only said that CHC was prepared to pay a mark-up because it wanted Xtron to be independent.\n\n\"Mr Lam, if you have no answer to what I've been asking for the last 10 minutes, I suggest to you then that what we see here (in the e-mail) suggests that your evidence about City Harvest and Xtron being two entities that operate independently of each other and at arm's length is not true. Do you agree or disagree?\"\n\n\"I disagree,\" Lam said.\n\nThe hearing is adjourned until Aug 4.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For the full year ended March 31, 2014, SingTel saw a 15.9 per cent easing in acquisition cost per postpaid customer here, from S$302 to S$254.\n\n\"Fast-falling handset subsidies are another positive trend that would benefit margins,\" Maybank Kim Eng Research's Mr Yap noted in his May report.\n\nOn the fibre broadband front, things are expected to heat up in an already competitive environment. In previous quarters, the telcos have taken hits from new and smaller fibre broadband players entering the market with cutthroat prices.\n\nThis is set to continue, with fibre broadband average revenue per user expected to dip further or stay flat, analysts say.\n\nAnd while the spectre of a fourth telco looms now that broadband firm MyRepublic wants in on the full-fledged telco scene, industry watchers do not seem particularly perturbed.\n\nA UOB Kay Hian report earlier this week noted how some fund managers have \"questioned the business case\" for incurring the massive capital expenditure that a fourth player would need, given the current high penetration rate.\n\nThe report maintained its \"overweight\" rating on the telco sector. \"In the near term, we remain positive on M1 due to positive trends for mobile, such as increased usage of data and lower handset subsidies,\" the report said.\n\n\"We see SingTel as a hedge against regulatory risk in Singapore, and there could be a potential reversal of yield compression.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Debbie Yong and Georgine Verano give updates on new collaborative working communities - with a difference\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jul 18, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWoolf Works\n\n176 Joo Chiat Rd, #02-01 Tel 9002 3724\n\ninfo@woolfworks.sg\n\nwww.facebook.com/WoolfWorksSg\n\nAH, the power of great writers to articulate sentiments that hold true long after they're gone. When Virginia Woolf wrote her 1923 essay A Room Of One's Own, did she know that it would later become the inspiration for Singapore's first women-only co-working space?\n\nChristened Woolf Works in tribute, the week-old space in Joo Chiat is Michaela Anchan's circa-2014 manifestation of Woolf's belief that \"a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction\". The New Zealand native felt that message keenly. She juggles dual roles as a writer of short stories and fiction and as a stay-home mother with two children aged five and 12. She says: \"After taking care of the kids and the family, I hardly get any free time or space at home where I can focus on my writing.\"\n\nThat kicked off her search for a personal office space six months ago, which was shortly called off when the options proved too costly. Then she discovered the concept of co-working. \"I thought maybe other women and mothers in the same predicament could benefit from a collective space,\" says Ms Anchan.\n\nBesides, as an active member of several business networking groups for women, \"I enjoy the energy of women working together and very often we have to deal with the same struggles such as balancing our domestic responsibilities with our personal ambitions,\" she says. Open to \"anyone from business professionals to writers and bloggers\", Woolf Works additionally targets a group that Ms Anchan believes to be growing: the \"mum-preneur\", or stay-home mothers turned entrepreneurs.\n\nExisting co-working spaces in the Central Business District tend to be too corporate for this group, while the more edgy co-working spaces are typically skewed towards technology entrepreneurs, she says.\n\nWhat Ms Anchan wanted to create instead was \"a calm and peaceful space for women looking for a place where they can be themselves\", she says. Besides the usual office amentities such as free wireless Internet access, printing facilities, a library of magazines and business publications, and a cosy meeting room that seats up to three, the 1,400 sq ft space on the second floor of a Joo Chiat shophouse has plenty of female-oriented features.\n\nA bouquet of fresh flowers is delivered by neighbourhood florist, Hiew, daily. Soft music plays in the background and the communal pantry is stocked with Sarnies coffee and healthy snacks such as dried fruit and nuts from local brand, Fave. Lots of wide open spaces and a white and bright yellow colour palette conceptualised by a Dutch architect-friend gives the space an airy, contemporary feel.\n\n\"I've even had someone enquire if she could sign up just to have a quiet space where she can read a book,\" laughs Ms Anchan.\n\nRates start at S$500 for the five permanent desks and part-time use for the 25 \"hot desks\" are charged at S$200, S$300 and S$400 monthly for weekly, twice weekly and thrice weekly visits. Or drop in on an ad-hoc basis for S$50 per day. Permanent members get 24/7 use of the space, whereas others can use the space from 9am to 6pm daily. A conference room upstairs that can hold 12 people seated and 25 standing can be booked for S$40 per hour and upwards - for everything from business meetings to group pilates classes.\n\nMs Anchan will engage guest speakers to conduct professional workshops on goal-setting and business incorporation in the space, along with regular business networking social events for women. Talks start from next week and are free for members (S$5 per entry for the public).\n\nA tad too sexist? While men can't sign up as members, they can, however, accompany members as guests for these events, says Ms Anchan. On the rise in popularity of co-working spaces, she observes: \"The nature of how we all work is changing. More people are choosing to work from home these days and office space is simultaneously getting more and more expensive.\"\n\nIf this space takes off, she would like to open further spaces in the western part of Singapore, preferably next to a childcare centre. \"But let's do this one step at a time,\" she says.\n\nDRAWN TO CO-WORKING\n\nArt Social Haus\n\n#10-08 Oxley Bizhub 2\n\n62 Ubi Road 1\n\nwww.facebook.com/artsocialhaus\n\nAS anyone who has dabbled in creating art can attest, it is a messy affair.\n\nPaint splatters and stains. Solvents stink up the room. The cat might trample all over your drying masterpiece, and good luck trying to pack all of that up quickly when your children demand that your \"art studio\" - really the family dining table - be returned at meal times.\n\nSo weary of having to deal with such issues were graphic designers Sheau Chan and Erica Tsirtsakis that the two women came together to start art-centric co-working studio, Art Social Haus, last month.\n\n\"We initially thought of renting an art studio to share between us, but since we both have full-time jobs, we decided to find a place we could open up to others like us to fully utilise the space,\" says Ms Chan. Both she and Australia-raised Argentinian Ms Tsirtsakis work with foreign design agencies based here. They met two years ago when Ms Tsirtsakis attended a diploma course in visual design that Ms Chan taught.\n\nPositioned somewhere between a professional art studio and an art-jamming space, where amateur artists rent easels, brushes and paints on an hourly basis, Art Social Haus is targeted at \"people who are slightly more serious than the hobbyist painter, but who are not established enough yet to be able to afford a studio of their own\" - such as fresh graduates from the various art schools, says Ms Chan. Her day-job is also based out of a co-working space in the Central Business District.\n\n\"Most artists like to work on their own, but sometimes when you run out of inspiration, it's also nice to have people to talk to or just to walk around the premises to see what others are doing,\" she adds.\n\nRates at Art Social Haus start from S$280 per person per month, which gets you a 1.5 m by 1.2 m personal workspace that includes an easel, a stool and a trolley. Members also have free use of communal facilities such as two manual inking stations for print makers, a large wooden table for meetings, a cosy sofa lounge with a pantry stocked with teas and coffee, and a bathroom with an industrial metal sink. Dry on inspiration? Dip in the outdoor pool or take a treadmill break in the shared gym on the top floor in the brand new light industrial building. Art Social Haus can fit up to 10 easels and eight work desks for a total of 15 people at full capacity. There is minimum rental period of six months for desks and three months for easels. For the non-committal artist, workstations are also open for daily rentals on weekends at S$35 per 4-hour morning or afternoon session, and S$60 for a full eight-hour stretch.\n\nEach monthly member will be given an access key which gives them 24-hour access to the studio, \"because we know a lot of creative people are most productive from midnight to sunrise,\" laughs Ms Chan. \"We want to create a community where people can feel comfortable, learn from each other, even bake cookies to share with one another,\" adds Ms Tsirtsakis of the 1,000 sq ft rectangular room kitted out with hand-restored kitchenware and second-hand furniture from the Salvation Army. In the spirit of camaraderie, members who sign up for monthly rentals can opt to share the space with up to two other friends for S$350 per person for two people per month; and S$400 per person per month for a three-person sharing arrangement.\n\nAll members get to hold one free exhibition held at the space within the membership period. There are no restrictions on the types of artists and their mediums that the space can accommodate, say Ms Chan and Ms Tsirtsakis, who hope to attract everyone from painters to sculptors, and printmakers to ceramic artists to sign up.\n\nThe two women plan to gradually host creative workshops showcasing less conventional art forms such as tattoo art, talks by female artists, poetry readings and even art-themed whisky and food pairing dinners in the space. Groups of painters can also rent the easel spaces collectively for private tutelage and events.\n\nThe place will not be manned by a community manager all the time, adds Ms Tsirtsakis. \"We hope to encourage people to take ownership of the space. We're not a stiff service office.\"\n\nTEAM-BUILDING, LITERALLY\n\nThe Tool Room\n\n12 Dunlop Street Tel 8233 9810\n\nhttp://toolroom.me\n\nWHEN the going gets tough, the really tough keep going at it - with a hammer.\n\nThat's what cocktail bar owner Abhishek Cherian George did when he found out that the Little India shophouse he had taken over could not get a liquor licence. No, he wasn't unleashing a vengeful rampage for his dashed dreams of running a second speakeasy in the area. The hammering and sawing was part of Mr George's Plan B: to transform the three-storey shophouse into the co-working space of his dreams. \"The objective was to solve all the problems I had when I was trying to find a place to work,\" says Mr George of The Tool Room, which opened last month.\n\nFor the sufferer of chronic back problems, this meant equipping each workstation with eye-level monitors, standing-height desks, personal orthotic Equilibras slippers and, depending on the membership package you take up, even S$800 ergonomically designed Locus Seats. Worked too late into the night and missed the last train home? Just hop on one of the four foldable bicycles that you can borrow to get home. Or take a quick nap till morning on the \"napping loft\" upstairs.\n\nThe three-level shophouse has 12 workstations on the ground floor, with 10 more under construction on the second floor. Membership comes in three tiers, priced from S$650 to S$850, and drawing on Mr George's F&B background - he also runs Boat Quay speakeasy The Spiffy Dapper and Dapper Coffee - some of the packages entitle members to personal bar fridges stocked with 20 bottles of cold-brew coffee every month, and complimentary cocktails when they visit the bar. The space cost $120,000 and four months to set up - half of what it would have cost if he had hired contractors instead of doing everything up himself.\n\nTembusu Terminal, the makers of Singapore's first Bitcoin ATM, are permanent tenants. The space will be an incubator of sorts for the private equity business that Mr George hopes to launch in the future, along with a second F&B outlet by year-end.\n\nINCUBATOR WITH SOME JAVA JIVE\n\nThe Cub\n\n48 Niven Road\n\nTHERE may be no such thing as a free lunch, but a free office space? Perhaps, though it comes with one catch: it is only for the very enterprising.\n\nTo get a seat at The Cub - a large oval meeting table that fits up to 12 around it - you have to first pitch your business idea to venture capitalist Joel Sng. For the table sits in the middle of the hubbub in a 2,000 sq ft shophouse along Niven Road, an office and startup incubator for the various businesses that Mr Sng invests in.\n\nHe explains the generosity: \"We want to give out the space to support budding entrepeneurs, I have excess capacity. Even if I charge S$100 a month for a seat, it doesn't move the needle from a returns point of view.\"\n\nEven if the pitch is not successful, startups are welcome to use the space. \"I don't see it as a loss, if they are here for awhile and we've shared great ideas and learnt from each other, there's value in that too,\" says Mr Sng, a Harvard graduate who runs his family's investment business, and who co-founded a venture capital firm, Formation 8, which also runs out of the shophouse. Two of his other businesses, LifeOpp, a site which pairs jobseekers with employers started last March, and Asiagenomics, which owns the distribution rights for genomics testing in Singapore, occupy the rest of the space.\n\nStartups at The Cub can get legal advice from Mr Sng's legal team and \"piggy back on good rates\" offered by partner accounting firms, he says. Besides free Internet connection, budding entrepeneurs can also lounge in a nook at the back of the second floor furnished with colourful bean bags and carpet grass, or hold more formal discussions in a glass-encased meeting room that seats up to eight.\n\nStartups which have used the space range from single-person ventures to a four-man team, and include businesses such as Learnemy, an online marketplace for teachers and students, and Mr Huntly, an online global network of headhunters. There is no time limit to how long startups can use the space, says Mr Sng, but there is one rule: Everyone has to come in at 9am. \"It promotes discipline and keeps you on track,\" he explains. Tenants are welcome to stay on to work through the night, if they prefer.\n\nShould a caffeine kick be required, there's Whale & Cloud, a colourful office pantry stocked with coffee beans that Mr Sng has accumulated from his business trips around the world, and used by the various startups for meetings with their clients and potential investors on weekdays.\n\nWhen the office is shut on weekends, the 300 sq ft space morphs into a weekend-only cafe-cum-retail store that has been gradually drawing a steady stream of largely young expatriate residents from the condominiums nearby and local cafe-hoppers. You enter the cafe through the back alley by knocking on a closed door numbered 48 and 3/4.\n\nCO-LIVING FOR LIKE-MINDED\n\n13\n\n13 Lorong 24A Geylang\n\nhttp://thirteen.99.co\n\nWORK-LIFE separation? So last generation.\n\nAccording to Darius Cheung, there is a growing demand for people who want to sleep where they work. Six months ago, he founded 13, a co-working and co-living space \"for people who want to live with a purpose,\" he says.\n\nNamed for its house number and part of the Lorong 24A Shophouse Series collective of architect-designed conservation shophouses in Geylang, 13 is a sprawling 4,000 sq ft, five-storey shophouse that comprises six reidential rooms and 15 co-working office desks that can be rented on a monthly basis.\n\nWhile the co-living concept isn't new - similar projects exist in cities such as New York, Berlin, Stockholm, Kyoto and even Matera in rural Italy, where residents have individual rooms but share community-managed work spaces and facilities - 13 was particularly inspired by Mr Cheung's two weeks spent in the eight-room Sandbox House in Berkeley and the 30-room Embassy in San Francisco last year. There, he observed technology entrepreneurs living among designers and food innovators who manned the apartments' edible gardens, recalls Mr Cheung, who is also the co-founder of 99.co, an online apartment rental search platform.\n\nThe all en-suite rooms at 13 range from 300 sq ft to 800 sq ft in size and cost between S$1,300 and S$2,000 in monthly rent. Each resident has to commit to a minimum stay of six months, as required by law, and potential housemates are first invited to the house's dinners or monthly house parties that gather the local startup community to see if they would fit in with the mix.\n\nThere is no strict criteria as to who can join as residents, but Mr Cheung believes the unconventional nature of the space and its Geylang location makes it a \"self-selecting process\". \"We did have some bankers who were keen to live here because of the space, but they didn't quite fit in with the rest of the housemates so we had to say no,\" says Mr Cheung.\n\nThe house is currently fully tenanted out to a French couple who work in fashion, a graphic designer from England, a fashion designer from India, a Singapore-educated Indian national who runs a startup specialising in drone technology, and the teams behind software engineering company Watt Digital and short film online platform Viddsee.\n\nBesides the rooms, there are also 15 \"hot desks\" that non-residents can rent for S$350 a month, which includes 24-hour access to the shophouse and all its facilities and events. The open-counter kitchen is fitted with a projector screen so it can double as a meeting room in the day time.\n\nWhile 13 is \"just barely breaking even\" for now, \"we're not doing it for profit, but because it's interesting,\" says Mr Cheung, who came across the shophouse when visiting an art exhibition in a neighbouring unit last year.\n\n\"It could be profitable if we took a less costly space, but we intentionally wanted a place that is design-centric and inspiring,\" he adds. Other units in the Shophouse Series have a current tag of S$9,000 to S$11,000 in monthly rent.\n\nWhile Mr Cheung believes there is room for more co-living projects in Singapore, particularly another one close to the local universities and the startup hub at Block 71, Ayer Rajah, in the western parts of Singapore, he has no concrete plans to launch a second venue yet.\n\n\"It was very risky at first, we didn't know if anyone would even be interested,\" he admits.\n\nBy Debbie Yong\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\n@DebbieYongBT\n\nONE-STOP SHOPS FOR STARTUPS\n\nHome-Fix XPC (Experience Centre)\n\n19 Tai Seng Avenue, Home-Fix Building #06-01 Tel 6671 9000\n\nwww.home-fix.com\n\nMon - Fri: 9.30am-6.30pm; Sat: 10am-6.30pm; Closed on Sundays and public holidays\n\nSTARTED by hardware store Home-Fix's founder and managing director Low Cheong Kee, Home-Fix XPC is the third in a series of \"makerspaces\" to have opened here this year, and possibly the largest.\n\nA makerspace is an area that provides not only co-working space but also tools and workshop facilities for members. The 10,000 sq ft Home-Fix XPC is really a large workshop and office that sits on the first two levels of Home-Fix's headquarters in Tai Seng Avenue.\n\nWhat was originally intended to be a knowledge resource centre for hardware enthusiasts to meet and swap ideas developed into a \"makerspace\" late last year when Mr Low was approached by the Singapore Makers - an online community of about 1,000 enthusiasts (600 of whom are in contact with Home-Fix) - who were looking to use Home-Fix's headquarters to host Maker Meetups. XPC is fully equipped to house those whose projects range from woodworking to electronics and 3D printing. Level 2 is divided into four glass-walled rooms housing a meeting room, a prototyping lab, an electronics room with benches lined with power tools and a well-stocked workshop which provides materials such as table saws and drills.\n\nFor added convenience, they've even set up a materials store, where members can purchase wood, fabric or other materials for their projects. Ernest Hu, the creative executive who runs XPC's operations, says that they are planning to move the workshop areas to the first floor, and provide more co-working spaces for members.\n\nThough it was only started in June, Home-Fix XPC's roster of members now includes a full-time carpenter, 3D printer developers and even a bicycle crafter. Mr Hu says that although not all the spaces have been taken up yet, reaction has been strong enough for them to further expand the co-working space. Members can utilise the space from S$20 daily to SS$400 monthly. For S$20, you get to use the workshop space and all its tools, equipment and machines for a day. You will be assigned a workbench with your personal tools. For a monthly rate of S$120, you will receive unlimited access to the same facilities for a month, and for SS$400 a month, you will receive a co-working table, free Wi-Fi as well as free use of the pantry, workshop and meeting rooms. For uncompleted projects, there is an optional storage locker for S$50 per month.\n\nThe Merry Men Collective\n\n315 Outram Road, Tan Boon Liat Building #05-01 Tel 6223 6856\n\nwww.tmmcollective.com\n\nTHE Merry Men Collective, owned by Shawn Heng and Eugene Fung, is a co-working space for companies to work not just side by side, but together.\n\nThe partners purchased the space in the Tan Boon Liat building two months ago while hunting for an office of their own. Although it was too big for their still-growing company, they didn't want to pass up on the sun-soaked space with its 3m-high ceilings. This, in turn, inspired sharing the space with like-minded startups, creatives, or young businesses which did not need or could not afford a proper office space.\n\nMr Heng and his partner engaged an interior designer friend to help them redesign the 1,600 sq ft space, with 14 tables, a meeting room at the back as well as a pantry for their clients. Being in the bar business, they incorporated a mini-bar section that fully stocks beers, champagnes and wines for clients as well.\n\nRentals range from S$500 to S$600 a month; S$500 gets you a standard desk with four storage shelves, while S$600 gets you a slightly larger desk with eight storage shelves. Mr Heng insists they're not in this for the money - they even have a barter system with some clients, swapping skills for rental payment. One example is photographer Joshua Sim, who owns The Beautiful Moment Photography, whom Mr Heng says takes photos for The Merry Men Collective in exchange for rental sometimes.

Japan Foods, the group behind Japan- themed restaurants such as Ajisen Ramen, Menya Musashi and Osaka Ohsho, is however taking these in its strides - having put in the necessary measures in the past years.\n\nJust this year, in view of a staff shortage and the need to raise salaries to keep its existing staff, the group started placing an iPad at every table in its restaurants, enabling patrons to place their orders themselves. This helps the group keep expenses in check. \"We will increase salaries, but we're going to reduce the number of staff,\" says chief executive officer Takahashi Kenichi in an interview with The Business Times.\n\nThere will, of course, be some customers who don't know how to use the iPads. When that happens, there are staff on stand-by to help them, he says. \"But 90 per cent (of our customers) can do it.\"\n\nBesides the iPad menu, Japan Foods in 2007 expanded the small central kitchen it had since 2002. Now, the facility at Kampong Ampat makes everything from gyozas to salmon teriyaki.\n\n\"So our restaurant operations are kept simple, and this reduces the need for manpower,\" the engineer- turned-entrepreneur explains.\n\nOn top of that, the group bought its own noodle machines three years ago. Cost-cutting measures such as these, as well as a strong Singapore dollar against the Japanese yen, have helped to reduce the proportion of Japan Food's materials cost from 21.7 per cent in the 2012 financial year to 18.4 per cent in the 2014 financial year.\n\nAsked about escalating rental costs, which have been voiced by many a retailer, Mr Kenichi says that the increases have been acceptable for the group so far and within \"single-digit levels\".\n\nAn astute sense of what landlords want has helped. \"Customers and management (of shopping malls) are always looking for new brands,\" he says. Hence, while Ajisen is the main brand for the group, Japan Foods has also branched into new brands, especially since 2008.\n\n\"Landlords want new ones, especially when they build a new shopping centre . . . And if I have many brands, in a good shopping centre, we can put three to four brands.\"\n\nOf the group's 45 outlets in Singapore, three are in Ang Mo Kio hub and VivoCity each, while four are in Bugis Junction. This approach also lends the group greater negotiation power when the time comes for renewal of leases.\n\nAnother advantage of having multiple brands is that when one brand doesn't work, the group can easily substitute it with another. For example, when the group's dessert brand Let's Sweets at Bugis Junction and Junction 8 started performing badly about six months after its launch in 2010, Japan Foods switched the space to other brands.\n\n\"Conversion costs aren't too high,\" says Mr Kenichi.\n\nThe group's relationships with landlords are so important, it was partly why Japan Foods embarked on the listing route. The restaurant operator launched its initial public offering in February 2009, bravely staring down low valuations in the capital markets after the global financial crisis.\n\nThe group said then that it was optimistic about the defensive nature of the food and beverage industry, even under difficult economic conditions. But more important than raising funds from the IPO was increasing the group's appeal to customers and landlords, says Mr Kenichi.\n\n\"Many ramen shops were coming, and if a landlord has good space, it could give (that space) to either us or the newcomers. So with the IPO, we could get a better place, and also at a slightly better price.\"\n\nThe increased competition it saw then included famous Japanese ramen chain Ippudo, which opened here in October 2009. Now, ramen chains, including BreadTalk's Ramenplay and Marutama Ra-Men, are commonplace - a far cry from the time Ajisen first started in Singapore in 1997, when people here mistook ramen for laksa.\n\nThe IPO also helped to raise the profile of the group, with Japanese restaurants contacting Japan Foods for collaboration opportunities after that. In the past, it was a one-way courtship process with Mr Kenichi doing the pursuing.\n\nWith various franchise licences under its belt, Japan Foods is now looking for joint venture partners in Southeast Asia, especially since the group holds the licence for the Ajisen brand in Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam as well.\n\nAlready, the group has had a successful joint venture collaboration with Ajisen China (Holding) for the Menya Musashi brand in Hong Kong and China, a market where a strong local partner with good relationships with landlords is critical, Mr Kenichi says.\n\nIn Singapore, it plans to bring in one or two new brands in the next few years, possibly opening up to 100 outlets in a few years. The group had only 27 outlets when it listed.\n\n\"The Singapore market is quite small, but if you have a lot of brands, it's fine,\" he says. \"It's competitive but from our results you can see that we've been progressing every year.\"\n\nIn the longer term, the group could possibly expand beyond just running restaurants. While now it makes food for its own outlets at the central kitchen, in future it could sell these to other restaurant firms and directly to consumers through supermarkets.\n\nThe group closed its financial year on March 31 setting a new record for both its revenue and net profit, and prompting its board to raise its annual target dividend ratio from 35 per cent to 40 per cent of its audited net profit. With a cash hoard of S$19 million and no borrowings, Japan Foods will hardly have any trouble meeting such increased dividend obligations.\n\nsandrea@sph.com.sg\n\n@AndreaSohBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Growth in the 45 emerging economies of Asia is still forecast to reach 6.2 per cent in 2014 and 6.4 per cent next year, however, the ADB said.\n\n\"External demand is forecast to be somewhat weak as the moderate pace of growth in developing Asia persists and as strengthening in the major industrial economies, in particular the US, disappoints earlier expectations,\" the report warned.\n\n\"Growth in South-east Asia softened in the first half of 2014 largely because of country-specific factors in Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam,\" it noted.\n\nIn Indonesia, growth in the first quarter of 2014 slowed to 5.2 per cent as soft external demand, low commodity prices, and a temporary ban on exports of selected minerals undermined recovery in net exports, the ADB said. Domestic demand remained robust, however, with growth in private consumption driven by election spending, easing inflation and improved consumer confidence.\n\nThailand's political deadlock, meanwhile, has affected domestic demand and tourism there. The Thai economy contracted by 0.6 per cent in the first quarter and is likely to have contracted further in the second quarter. However, improved consumer confidence since the military takeover in May is a tentative sign that a modest recovery may take hold in the second half of the year.\n\nVietnam's growth forecast has been slightly reduced by the ADB to account for tensions with China and their effect on economic activity, including recent factory riots. Growth forecasts for other South-east Asian economies are generally in line with ADO 2014 expectations.\n\nThe 2014 forecast for the South-east Asia sub-region has been downgraded by 0.3 percentage points by the ADB to 4.7 per cent. But as the factors slowing growth in 2014 are expected to be temporary, the forecast growth of 5.4 per cent in 2015 has been maintained.\n\n\"Developing Asia as a region continues to perform well,\" ADB's deputy chief economist Juzhong Zhuang said in a statement accompanying the Manila-based development bank's latest bi-annual update of regional economic prospects.\n\n\"The pace of the growth moderation in China is in line with our expectations while the stage is set for India to pursue reform that could unlock its growth potential,\" the report said.\n\nChina's growth \"is moderating in line with earlier expectations and should achieve the (ADB'S) forecast 7.5 per cent in 2014 and 7.4 per cent in 2015, while East Asia as a whole is similarly paced to meet growth projections of 6.7 per cent in both 2014 and 2015\".\n\nIndustrial production in China expanded by 8.8 per cent in the second quarter, slightly above the 8.7 per cent growth recorded in the first quarter, the ADB said.\n\n\"More rapid expansion of services lifted their growth rate to 8 per cent for the first half of the year from 7.8 per cent in the first quarter. Retail sales grew by 10.8 per cent in the second quarter of 2014, pointing to healthy consumer demand. Real estate indicators, by contrast, signal continued weakness but this is compensated by accelerated infrastructure investment.\"\n\nWith parliamentary elections over, India is expected to pursue long-delayed reforms, the ADB suggested.\n\n\"India's growth forecast is maintained at 5.5 per cent in fiscal year 2014 but upgraded to 6.3 per cent in fiscal year 2015. With this improved outlook for the largest economy in South Asia, expansion in the sub-region is expected to reach 5.4 per cent in 2014 and pick up to 6.1 per cent in 2015.\"\n\nJapan, meanwhile, grew by a \"robust\" seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.7 per cent in the first quarter 2014, driven by both private consumption and investment, the ADB report noted.\n\nJapan's stronger performance in the first quarter of 2014 suggests slightly faster growth in 2014, now forecast at 1.5 per cent, up from 1.3 per cent in April, the report said.\n\nDeclining food prices and relatively stable oil prices are meanwhile keeping developing Asia's inflation in check at 3.5 per cent in 2014 and 3.7 per cent in 2015, it added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These reforms, however, are expected to bring many benefits.\n\nFor a start, the Stock Connect between Hong Kong and Shanghai that opens the way for Chinese residents to buy Hong Kong shares and for Hong Kong investors to buy shares on the Shanghai bourse will be a booster to the languishing A-share market, and there is market talk that this initiative could be extended to London and Singapore in the future.\n\nSSE chief economist Hu Ruyin told BT: \"When the domestic listing regime is liberalised and the valuations are right, that will be a good window for the Shanghai international board to be launched, and by then, it can be rolled out fairly quickly.\"\n\nFor now, a conducive market for domestic companies to raise funds is more critical, said Dr Hu in Mandarin on the sidelines of the Future China Forum yesterday, after delegates were told that mom-and-pop investors account for some 99 per cent of total trading accounts in China and 80 per cent of trading volumes.\n\nSeveral reforms are underway to stimulate the lacklustre A-shares and spur growth of the underdeveloped stock market. The Stock Connect between Shanghai and Hong Kong could be extended to Singapore and London in 2016, projected Cheah Cheng Hye, chairman of Asian-based fund Value Partners Group.\n\nChina also lifted a 14-month moratorium on initial public offerings in January; the unprecedented ban had closed a crucial exit door for many private equity firms on their investments and created a huge backlog of companies wanting to tap the market for funds.\n\nSince the IPO market's reopening, 52 IPOs have raised 35 billion yuan (S$7 billion) in Shanghai and Shenzhen, said Frank Lyn, PwC China & Hong Kong markets leader. He added that the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has projected another 100 IPOs in the second half of the year (it is not usual for regulators elsewhere to make such market forecasts), reflecting the influence that Chinese regulators still have on the stock market.\n\nThe Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges have a combined market capitalisation of 23 trillion yuan but they are not home to the largest and most profitable Chinese Internet giants Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, which have streamed to the US bourse. \"This reflects a major failure of the Chinese securities market in that it is not providing the services that it ought to be providing,\" Dr Hu said.\n\nThe new reforms seek to address these inadequacies by shifting the IPO regime from approval-based to registration-based, with IPO prices set by the market rather than the government. Delisting rules are also being introduced to get loss-making companies and those that have breached regulations to delist.\n\n\"The pricing mechanism is distorted,\" Dr Hu said. \"Some large blue- chip companies have low valuations of not even one times of earnings while there is too much speculation in small caps. With the market opening up, there will be greater rationality and more investors undertaking value investing.\"\n\nThis market infancy has also hindered the introduction of listed Reits and business trusts, despite the many years that the regulator spent on preparing a listing framework for these products.\n\nCapitaLand China deputy CEO Lucas Loh said at a panel discussion that if such a platform becomes available in China, this would provide another funding source for developers and local governments, and serve as an exit option for capital recycling. Retail investors would also have another option of investing in real estate, giving the sector greater sustainability.\n\nDr Hu told BT that with the outlook for Chinese developers clouded by fears of \"bubbles\" in some companies, rolling out such a listing framework now would be tough. \"With more product innovation, investor sophistication also has to go up.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There were perhaps more goalless draws than fans would have liked to see, but then again we were also treated to a rare display of football perfection when Germany tore up the history books by beating hosts Brazil 7-1 in the semi-finals.\n\nAs we look back on an amazing tournament, it's time to recognise those who played their part in making this year's World Cup the most memorable of all time.\n\nBest team: Germany\n\nThis was the easiest category to declare a winner. The Germans were more than deserving of their first World Cup trophy in 24 long years. Teamwork, discipline, talent, charisma and sheer determination, this youthful squad had all of these traits in abundance. They swept past some of the biggest names in the sport with ease and all signs point to a long period of German dominance in The Beautiful Game.\n\nBest coach: Louis van Gaal (The Netherlands)\n\nGermany's Joachim Loew was a hot favourite for this honour, but the nod goes to the Dutch boss for transforming a team that put in a disgraceful showing at the 2010 final to a cohesive unit that played attractive, attacking football. Holland ended their World Cup campaign unbeaten and left with the bronze medal after trouncing Brazil 3-0 in the third-place playoff match.\n\nVan Gaal's standing as one of the world's top managers has been boosted many times over, and he will hope to deliver the same level of success with his new employers, Manchester United, when the new English Premier League season kicks off next month.\n\nBest player: James Rodriguez (Colombia)\n\nHow this youngster was not named Player of the Tournament is beyond me. Argentina's Lionel Messi eventually took home the Golden Ball award, but it doesn't take a genius to figure out who the real star of the World Cup was. The 23-year-old Rodriguez had a breakout performance in his country's five games in Brazil, scoring a tournament-high six goals in the process. He was voted Man of the Match against Uruguay, Ivory Coast and Greece.\n\nBest goal: Mario Goetze (Germany)\n\nGoetze's amazing extra-time goal in the final against Argentina stands out not just for its sheer quality, but also for the significance of being the one that won Germany their fourth World Cup trophy. Goetze, who had been on the field for barely half-an-hour after coming on as a second-half substitute, took Andre Schurrle's cross neatly on his chest before volleying the ball straight into the net. World class.\n\nBiggest surprise: Costa Rica\n\nI had declared the Latin Americans the most surprising nation of the World Cup after the group stages, and I haven't changed my mind since. Costa Rica, tipped to be one of the minnows, topped a group that contained Uruguay, England and Italy. They then went on to beat Greece in a penalty shoot-out to reach the quarter-finals for the first time, where they lost to the Netherlands on penalties after a heroic 0-0 draw.\n\nAlgeria was a close second for this honour, the North Africans making it to the Round of 16 for the first time where they gave Germany an almighty scare before losing 1-2 in extra time.\n\nBiggest flops: Spain, England, Italy\n\nThese three European giants fluffed their lines on the big stage. Spain, winners of the last three major football tournaments, crashed out in the first week. England self-destructed as usual, earning just one point from three very listless performances. Italy, a country that some had predicted to go far in Brazil, couldn't even get out of their group.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/semi-permanent-beauty", "site_title": "Semi-permanent beauty", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nSemi-permanent beauty\n\nFor time-strapped women, the latest in time-saving beauty treatments help cut down face- prepping considerably. But are some of the treatments worth the risks? By May Yip\n\nPublished Fri, Jul 18, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nFORGET the five-minute face. Recent research by US morning TV programme The Today Show and mass media corporation AOL found that the average woman spends 55 minutes on her appearance every day - or two weeks in a year.\n\nBut if a similar study were to be made on women here, those numbers may take a big dip. Today, minutes could be shaved off one's beauty routine thanks to a slew of lasting beauty treatments - from hair straightening sessions that don't leave tresses looking totally limp, to natural-looking brows that mimic Cara Delevingne's voluminous arches.\n\nHomegrown semi-permanent make-up chain Erabelle has seen a 24 per cent increase in annual revenue from its eyebrow embroidery packages last year; while Strip, another local beauty chain initially known for its waxing services, notes that over 70 per cent of customers now opt for permanent Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) hair removal treatments. Half the customers at nail salon chain Manicurious also choose gel manicures over regular polishes. The earlier procedure lasts an average of two to three weeks, compared to mere days for old-school manis.\n\n\"Such spikes (in eyebrow embroidery) could well be attributed to the fact that more people realise how well-groomed brows can make a great difference to their appearance,\" says general manager and founder of Erabelle, Esther Kerk. \"Unkempt brows can easily downplay one's tidiness. And such a procedure makes it convenient for clients to look fresh from the moment they wake up in the morning, without spending additional time trying to balance their eyebrows or groom them.\"\n\nState-of-the-art brows\n\nCorporate finance executive Linda Lee, for example, has opted for laser hair removal and semi-permanent brow and eyeliner make-up in recent years. \"It is mainly out of convenience, I am just lazy, quite simply put,\" says Ms Lee, who would return to the salon for touch-ups on a yearly basis.\n\nThe latest breed of lasting beauty fixes is a far cry from the damaging treatments of yore, which often yielded unsightly results. Gone are the days of blue-tinted tattooed brows, for example, or nail extensions that destroy your digits. Instead, the focus is on looking naturally accentuated without wrecking one's God-given assets. \"If you are comparing the earlier generations of embroidery and now, the colour pigment quality is definitely higher, and geared towards looking natural in the skin,\" explains Ms Kerk.\n\nThe brow embroidery chain employs European-made machines and pigments as it claims the continent is an innovator when it comes to medical tattooing. Procedures include areola re-pigmentation for patients who have undergone mastectomy; camouflaging burns and surgical scars with flesh-coloured pigment. The current needle-based technique by the centre is said to offer greater control to its brow artists and help create subtler eyebrows, and costs from S$1,314 for four sessions, for customers who have not had eyebrow embroidery done previously. The downside: Such techniques require touch-ups every three to six months, depending on one's lifestyle and skin condition.\n\nHowever, this means greater flexibility for clients. In countries such as Hong Kong, customers may opt to tweak their brows according to the seasons, trends and their hair colour, says Erabelle's spokesman. Similarly at Browhaus, a wide range of colour pigments is available to match one's tresses. Its selection of 100 per cent vegetable dyes are also safe and don't fade out into unsatisfactory hues - like a reddish undertone often associated with brown-based dyes. Technicians wield a flexible carving tool to manually create three-dimensional-looking brows, and \"Brow Resurrection\" services range from S$963 to S$2,140.\n\nBut while such treatments have caught up with the times, not all semi-permanent procedures are made the same. With a huge variance in pricing also comes a wide range in hygiene and safety levels. Since such treatments have long-term effects, there is also a higher level of risk involved.\n\nGel manicures, for example, may be the holy grail of nails but they run the gamut from hard gels to gel polishes. While \"true gel\" nails are cured to a hard, long-lasting finish, a hybrid variant - the gel polish, is cheaper and dries faster, but could contain noxious ingredients.\n\n\"A certain ingredient found in most gel polishes, and not gel nails, is BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole), which is considered a cancer-causing agent,\" says Shawn Tan, co-owner of Manicurious, which offers the more nail-friendly \"true gel\" brand from Japan, Presto. \"So, it is recommended to pay more for a reputable gel brand rather than choosing cheaper options.\"\n\nAnd although recent studies have noted that there is a low chance of getting skin cancer from using traditional ultra-violet (UV) lamps to dry nail polish, Presto gels are cured with LED lamps instead, which emit lower levels of UV radiation and require a shorter curing time. The nail colours from the brand are also tailored to Asian skin tones. A normal non-gel manicure costs about S$30.\n\n\"With the right manicurist and company culture, much of the damage can be prevented,\" explains Mr Tan, who prices his gel manicures at S$85. \"Although pricier, proper gel removers are a lot less harsh than the use of pure acetone to soak off gels, and if a manicurist is not rushed into scraping off the gel overlay because of waiting customers, obviously your nails will be healthier.\"\n\nLikewise, while it appears that anyone with basic motor faculties could zap away a couple of stray follicles, the criteria for picking an IPL or laser hair removal centre should go beyond a low price. In lesser hands, IPL treatments may require numerous sessions before results can be seen, cause discomfort or even result in burns, says a spokesman for Strip, which also employs FDA-approved machines proprietary to the company. Prices start from about S$80 for the removal of fuzz from one area of the face, to just under S$2,000 to treat the legs of male clients.\n\n\"All our therapists are trained to identify skin issues such as dry and dehydrated skin, inflammation, rashes, eczema and rosacea on sight, and will advise you to treat your skin condition before returning for your IPL treatment,\" adds the spokesman. \"Even if your skin issue could not be detected by the naked eye, the therapists are trained to be able to tell if you should continue with the IPL treatment based on the feel of the applicator as it glides on your skin.\"\n\nFurthermore, hygiene should be of utmost importance for the professionals executing such beauty services, and at Browhaus, work areas and tools are sterilised with hospital-grade disinfectants, and new blades and needles are used for each session to prevent cross-contamination. Always held in private treatment rooms, rather than at an eyebrow artist's home or the atrium of a shopping mall, sanitation is also better managed.\n\n\"It is not cheap to undergo laser hair removal, but I do think that these treatments are worth investing in, especially for a lazy girl like myself,\" admits Ms Lee.\n\n\"I have not had any bad experiences, but I do hear of stories of girls going to less established salons to get their hair removal or eyebrows done, and end up with unsightly eyebrow shapes or adverse skin reactions.\"\n\nUltimately, such procedures may appeal to slothful sorts, but one has to put in the time and effort to track down the right treatments, or else possibly live with the undesirable results.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}

Out of all fixed-income trading, 60-65 percent is now done online, he said. Amundi oversees the equivalent of about US$1 trillion in trading globally, according to its website.\n\n\"The main advantages of electronic trading are efficiency and transparency,\" Mr Logerais said in a July 14 interview. \"There's a lot of time and cost saved, and it annihilates risk of trading error.\"\n\nElectronic transactions climbed in 2013 to about three- quarters of global foreign-exchange trading volume, according to Greenwich Associates data. At least a dozen regulators on three continents are investigating whether traders in the US$5.3 trillion-a-day market colluded with counterparts in other firms to manipulate benchmarks such as WM/Reuters rates.\n\nWM/Reuters rates are published hourly for 160 currencies and half-hourly for the 21 most-traded and are used by money managers and pension funds to determine what they pay for foreign currency. The benchmarks are based on trades in a minute-long period starting 30 seconds before the beginning of each half-hour. The most widely used is the 4pm London fix.\n\nBenchmark WM/Reuters rates are collected and distributed by Thomson Reuters Corp and World Markets Co, a unit of Boston-based State Street Corp. Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, competes with Thomson Reuters in providing news and information as well as currency-trading systems.\n\n\"Whenever we aren't required to comply with the fixing time for executing orders, we try to avoid it so we can open the trade to competition,\" Amundi's Mr Logerais said. \"Our top priority is to preserve the interest of our clients.\"\n\nWhile the asset manager doesn't get a lot of requests in Asia for trades to be executed at the London fix, it is being \"very sensitive\" to updates from regulators on the matter, he said.\n\nThe Financial Stability Board, which is led by Bank of England governor Mark Carney and reports to the Group of 20 (G-20) nations, published this week details of plans to overhaul the process of setting benchmark currency rates.\n\nBloomberg News reported last month that US prosecutors have broadened their probe into currency dealing by targeting the mark-ups that the world's biggest banks may impose on some customers.\n\nThe investigations are compounding troubles for foreign-exchange traders this year, who face their biggest-ever loss as volatility fell to a record.\n\nA Parker Global Strategies LLC index that tracks the performance of 14 top currency funds has fallen an annualised 6.4 per cent - the biggest drop in data going back to 2003. Deutsche Bank AG's Currency Volatility Index fell to an all-time low of 5.02 per cent on July 3.\n\nPrice swings in equity markets have also diminished. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index fell 4.6 per cent to 10.32 on July 3 - the lowest close in more than seven years.\n\n\"Maintaining your profitability is the biggest concern for the industry when trading volumes drop,\" Mr Logerais said. \"Less activity means people not being occupied on the desk, so there may be pressure to eliminate positions.\" Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nNvidia to resume H20 AI chip sales to China in US reversal\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nIndonesia looking at levy on coal exports to boost state coffers\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:03 PM\n\nAsia: Markets mixed as China\u2019s economy meets forecasts\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:49 AM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nFCT extends Northpoint City South Wing management by a year\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:28 AM\n\nChina\u2019s quant funds boost US recruiting after Trump\u2019s visa curbs\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nGold holds ground with spotlight on US inflation data\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:51 AM", "images": []}

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/slicker-city", "site_title": "Slicker city", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nSlicker city\n\nThe new Honda City is a small family sedan with surprisingly good performance. By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jul 18, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nFIRST, the bad news. The new Honda City isn't much to look at. The stubby sedan is ungainly, to say the least, with a design that looks like something someone using a 3D printer at home came up with.\n\nBut the good news is that the City is a great drive. It may have only a 1.5-litre naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine to power the front wheels but the unit is super responsive and, like most Hondas, the car has impeccable handling.\n\nThe fourth-generation City has a brand new platform which is based on a modular design that the shorter Jazz and other Honda models will also share.\n\nThe suspension, which comprises MacPherson struts in front and a torsion beam behind, is on the firm side but still sufficiently damped for ride comfort. Together with the new Earth Dreams continuously variable transmission (CVT) and electric power steering, it is set up for a surprisingly high level of driving fun.\n\nThe CVT is a brand new transmission with smaller-diameter pulleys for a wider range of ratios. The high-friction CVT fluid used also reduces slippage under acceleration.\n\nThis makes the CVT more direct without the rubber-band effect usually noticed in such transmission. Hence, there is less power loss and a smoother drive.\n\nAll this enables the City engine to seem bigger than 1.5 litres. Drive the sedan hard and it takes off like a pocket rocket. Never mind that the noise from under the hood is louder than galley slaves being flogged - the responsiveness of this heavily modified i-VTEC unit is impressive, thanks to new pistons and friction reduction measures to make it more efficient. A low kerb weight of 1,100 kg is helpful too.\n\nAs a result, the new City is more potent than its predecessor, which had a conventional five-speed automatic and whose transmission ratios were not as wide as the new CVT, which can have much shorter ratios when accelerating and taller ones when cruising. The seven-step CVT can also be manually \"shifted\" using steering wheel-mounted paddles, with crisper shifts than a conventional car.\n\nThe electric power steering (EPS) is also new and it is both precise and well-weighted. It is light at low speeds but immediately becomes meatier at highway speeds.\n\nThe motion-adaptive EPS also comes with the Vehicle Stability Assist system - first seen on the previous generation Odyssey - which constantly monitors all four wheels and together with the steering wheel angle sensor, automatically counter-steers if the car is under or over-steering in a corner.\n\nThat means constant correction for the optimum cornering line with positive steering feedback. Throw the City into one fast corner after the other and it will reward the keen driver with its composure and well-controlled ride. It is that good.\n\nInside, the City boasts a new seven-inch touchscreen that can be synced with a smartphone so that Honda-approved navigation and music apps can be used.

As cost pressures rise, they have been prompted to recalibrate their Asian operations.\n\nBut they still insist on the merits of the universal banking model in Asia, as they seek deep access to the region's growing wealth.\n\n\"With higher capital buffers, running a universal bank is becoming a lot harder,\" David Sayer, KPMG's global head of banking, told BT in an interview.\n\nThe universal banking model - under which lenders offer a combination of consumer, corporate or private banking services - is fractured across the two axes, he said.\n\nIn Europe, the increasing negative synergies between investment banking and retail banking are making the pairing unviable. In Asia, the growing sense that banks have to operate as subsidiaries (which are more expensive to run than branches) also means banks cannot move surplus liquidity within the group.\n\n\"One of the reasons they have been in Asean was to have access to savings. If you can't transfer it, there's no point in being here,\" Mr Sayer added.\n\nThe universal banking model was attractive due to the idea that \"a cross-selling supermarket would entice customers and smooth out cyclical fluctuations of each product or service\", said a 2013 report by Bain & Company. But today's regulations discourage this.\n\n\"They are going to be much more selective about what they get into,\" said Mark Austen, CEO of trade body Asifma (The Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association). \"If the banks are not in the top five, they are starting to pull back.\"\n\nReflecting this, Standard Chartered Bank this year sold two consumer units in South Korea, following a US$1 billion write-down for these units last year. It has also exited its securities services business in Taiwan, and is reportedly selling a consumer finance unit in Hong Kong.\n\nThe bank, which makes most of its profits from emerging markets, has warned of a 20 per cent fall in its first-half profit this year.\n\nHSBC and Citigroup - which, like StanChart, are heavily exposed to Asia - have exited businesses in Asia. HSBC bowed out of most, if not all, of its retail banking businesses in Japan, South Korea and Thailand. Citi sold its investment in India's largest mortgage lender, Housing Development Finance Corp, in 2012.\n\nBut a Macquarie report that compared HSBC and StanChart with the three Singapore lenders, said the two global banks are still running expensive franchises. This is despite the foreign banks being more productive with their assets.\n\n\"It's not a revenue problem that they have - it's a cost-efficiency issue.\"\n\nStanChart has a market cap that is one-and-a-half times larger than that of DBS, but it is active in four times as many countries.\n\n\"StanChart has not managed to achieve the leading market position in any of its larger markets,\" Macquarie said.\n\nHSBC also cites 20 markets as priorities (with many in Asia Pacific) - which are still too many, Macquarie said. Even with its trillion-dollar balance sheet, \"it will be impossible to achieve meaningful scale in more than 10 markets globally\", it said, adding more sales and restructuring should be on the cards.\n\nMeanwhile, Citi has said it will miss an internal profit target next year that measures earnings as a ratio to equity. Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat also shied away from the universal bank label. \"We don't put ourselves out there and talk about just being a universal bank. People shouldn't want us to be everything to everyone,\" he told Bloomberg early this year.\n\nBut this model remains relevant in Asia, said Michael Zink, head of Asean at Citi, given the trends of urbanisation and digitisation.\n\n\"Asia's emerging affluent consumer clients want to bank increasingly via digital channels, and as they travel, they want a banking partner who is global.\"\n\nA StanChart spokesman told BT the bank would avoid \"nice-to-haves or distractions, to ensure we optimise the use of every dollar of capital and investment\".\n\nThe bank said last November it would review its business portfolio. \"There is not a long list of peripheral businesses. So this is not going to move the dial substantially but should sharpen our focus.\" It pointed to the \"huge opportunity\" in the wealth management business in Asia, and plans to grow this substantially.\n\n\"As the only truly universal bank in Asia, Africa and the Middle East with a heritage of more than 150 years in these markets . . . we have the capability to link clients seamlessly across our footprint and especially as they internationalise.\"\n\nAn HSBC spokeswoman said the bank believes in the benefits of a universal banking model, and that the diversity translates to \"tremendous stability\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is especially true given the increasingly stringent new legal compliance rules and stock exchange guidelines now in place, said Heidrick & Struggles' Asia-Pacific Corporate Governance Report 2014.\n\nHarry O'Neill, the managing partner for the Asia-Pacific at the Nasdaq-listed professional services firm, said: \"In places like Hong Kong and Singapore, where many listed companies are family-owned, boards should regularly benchmark themselves against their peers to identify key differences that impact performance and share price.\"\n\nThe biennial report said: \"If agendas are organised to allow more time for business rather than compliance discussions, our research would suggest that there would be a positive impact on the capacity of boards to discuss risk and innovation, which could lead to improved performance.\"\n\nThe report drew on data from 170 publicly listed companies on stock exchanges in six Asia-Pacific markets - India, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand - and surveyed more than 165 board members. It suggested that high-performing boards focus on four key capabilities: people, leadership, vision and innovation. Key drivers that support these core capabilities include a balance between executive and non-executive directors, regular meetings, clear criteria for the replacement of directors, identification of opportunities to improve the board, gender and ethnic diversity and a sufficient number of independent directors to provide a balanced view.\n\nThe report said: \"Our survey shows a sharp contrast between the importance of these capabilities, and how Asia-Pacific directors say their boards are performing in reality.\" In fact, most respondents in Singapore and Hong Kong said that they felt their own board was underperforming in terms of identifying board improvement opportunities, with executive directors being least positive.\n\nThe report highlighted that Singapore boards had the lowest number of meetings and lacked improvement in gender mix. It said that while frequency of board meetings was not rated as highly as the other drivers, it was nevertheless an important contributor to board effectiveness. \"Certainly, with all the pressures on boards today, it would be difficult to deal with all regular and ad-hoc issues in five to eight meetings a year.\"\n\nSingapore boards meet an average of 5.8 times a year; Hong Kong ranks second lowest at 5.9 per year. Australia boasts the highest, at 11.1 per year.\n\nWhile gender diversity was hotly debated, the report said that it was more important for boards to focus on creating diversity of thinking from a broader pool of candidates: \"Women directors bring their own variety of experience, as well as their networks to the table. Similarly, international experience, combined with a board's wide and diverse networks, can, if recognised, have positive impacts on discussion and debate.\"\n\nIt noted that regionally, non-national directors on boards have risen in number, while the all-important Singapore, Japan and India representation has fallen.\n\nIn terms of gender mix, Singapore boards have made little progress; the percentage edged up to 6.3 per cent last year, from 6.1 per cent in 2011. Elsewhere in the region, gender diversity on boards has continued to improve, albeit still lagging behind Europe's 17 per cent for 2013; women made up 11.8 per cent of Asia-Pacific boards last year, up from 8.8 per cent in 2011.\n\nAt the end of the day, the report said, it is all about the people on the board. \"It is the ability of the directors to work together in a collegiate and sharing culture that makes top-performing boards. Without a common culture and a strong bond between directors, boards will be compliance-driven and not high-performing, effective boards.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Starting next month, across six weeks, you'll be treated to an array of music, opera, dance and theatre treats. We pick out the three must-watch shows, and the best of the rest. By HELMI YUSOF\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Jul 17, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nMUST-WATCH #1\n\nTurning Peter Pan inside out\n\nWITH chalk-white faces and black-rimmed eyes, the characters of Robert Wilson's plays appear like gothic, macabre corpses who have just stepped out of a Tim Burton animated feature.\n\nBut like Burton, Wilson has a way of making the macabre entertaining. And his hypnotic, avant garde interpretation of the children's book Peter Pan will likely be one of the most surreal experiences you'll have at the theatre this year.\n\nMake no mistake: Wilson's version of Peter Pan would give Walt Disney the chills. But for adventurous theatre-goers, Wilson's version offers a darker perspective on the popular tale, one that exposes the murkier side to the boy who never grows up. Here, the happy innocence of childhood is upended while the stark realities of youthful desires and disappointments come to the fore.\n\nSpeaking from Romania where he's opening a show, Wilson says: \"I was familiar with the Walt Disney version of Peter Pan, and didn't like it. I was somewhat familiar with the Broadway production too. And I was asked to direct it many years ago and chose not to do it.\"\n\n\"But a few years ago I read the original story from the 19th century and was surprised to see that it was so different from the Disney version. I was intrigued by the darkness and the light of the story so I decided to make my own production based more on the text.\"\n\nWilson says that the original story portrays Peter Pan as a \"prism of many personas\" - there are both light and dark sides to his character. The original story is also more cruel than what the cartoon and film versions made it out to be.\n\nIndeed, you can expect less of a linear narrative than a multi-faceted story that will captivate you with its stunning imagery, unusual choreography, atypical characterisations and the odd music of indie band CocoRosie.\n\nPeter Pan is both dashing and doubt-ridden. Captain is quietly dangerous. And Tinkerbell takes pleasure is giving children electric shocks with her wand.\n\nWilson made his name in the 1970s with the ground-breaking Einstein On The Beach, a musical collaboration with Philip Glass that is still raved about 38 years after its debut.\n\nHe went on create many acclaimed works, such as the CIVIL warS (1984), Alice (1992), and, most recently, The Life and Death of Marina Abramovic (2013).\n\nHe has frequently worked with the Berliner Ensemble, the renowned German theatre group founded by Bertolt Brecht, and Peter Pan marks their fourth collaboration.\n\nWilson has nothing but raves for his collaborators.\n\nHe says: \"The Berliner Ensemble actors have an amazing range and they can speak verse as well as prose with a beautiful command of language. They're able to render intelligently a dark tale with light.\"\n\n'Peter Pan' plays at the Drama Centre from Sept 11 to 13 at 8pm. Tickets from S$40 available at Sistic\n\nMUST-WATCH #2\n\nCalling out to the gods in 'Sambaso'\n\nIT may be unlike anything you've ever seen. But it promises to be spellbinding.\n\nSambaso is an ancient dance from Japan that depicts how the gods descended to earth, according to Japanese beliefs. Sambaso is an important ritual in Shinto, the indigenous religion of Japan, and it is carried out with utmost respect.\n\nA Japanese spokesman for the production describes it as having \"strong aspects of supernatural power, rather like a benediction ... Even before the programme starts, as the players prepare themselves in the dressing room, the ritual is begun. And this ritual of prayers continues until all the performers exit onto the stage.\"\n\nWhen Sambaso was performed at the Guggenheim Museum in New York last year, it received nothing but raves - even though several in the audience admitted they did not fully understand the intricate language of the dance.\n\nThe dance is made even more spectacular by the fact that it's performed by the great actor Mansaku Nomura, who has been awarded the Japanese government's title of Living National Treasure of Japan for his contributions to the performing arts. Mansaku and his very talented son, Mansai, will be performing the central role on different nights.\n\nFurther lending artistic heft to this production is acclaimed artist Hiroshi Sugimoto, perhaps better known to the wider public as the designer of Hermes limited edition scarves last year. Sugimoto is considered one of the most important photographers in the world, and he has designed Sambaso's stage curtains and costumes, using the lightning motifs from his famous Lightning Fields series of photographs.\n\nSays the spokesman: \"The curtains and costumes designed by Sugimoto, along with his stage direction, play an important part in invoking the deities.\" She adds: \"When the sambaso is performed, it releases the energy of humans. The energy that is emitted is felt by the audience - the more the performer concentrates, the more the audience is influenced and their imaginations are aroused. When this multiplier effect reaches its height, time and space become one and the divine spirit descends.\"\n\nThe dance, however, is only part of the show. It is followed by a kyogen, which is a comic story told using exaggerated, slapstick movements. Though it is narrated in Japanese, the skill and precision with which the actors play their roles ensure you don't need surtitles to enjoy it.\n\nFor lovers of world cultures, Sambaso is the one you shouldn't miss.\n\n'Sambaso' will be performed at the Victoria Theatre on Aug 28 and 29 at 8pm. Tickets from S$40 on sale at Sistic\n\nMUST-WATCH #3\n\nDisabled dancers set to move you\n\nIT may be hard to watch at first, but it could well be the most satisfying production in the entire festival.\n\nDisabled Theater by Jerome Bel and Theater Hora puts performers with mental disabilities on stage and asks them to express themselves through music. While some people might be appalled at the thought of such a show, the work has turned out to be very well-received by most critics and audiences. Rather than appearing exploitative or distasteful, it has achieved the impossible - creating an instant bridge of understanding between ordinary people and people with disabilities.\n\nAt first, the sight of mentally disabled dancers standing on stage might upset some folks who are not used to be seeing the disabled put in the spotlight. But when these dancers allow their bodies to sway naturally to their favourite music, unencumbered by notions of how dancers typically move on stage or TV, the audience quickly sees the raw and honest connection these dancers make with the music.\n\nThe audience gains a rare and moving insight into the hitherto unexplored world of music as experienced by the mentally disabled.\n\nBel, the production's choreographer, has been challenging the traditional vocabulary of dance for more than a decade. Speaking from Paris, he says: \"I have hesitated a lot to make this piece. I realised it was a real issue to work and put on stage mentally disabled people. The representation of disability is still a problem and that is why I decided to do it.\"\n\nAcknowledging the mixed emotions it typically elicits from audiences, Bel explains: \"I think our relationship with disability is quite complex. For most of us, it is a relationship which has not been taught or thought about. We have to question ourselves why we get so emotional watching it. It takes time, and the confrontation is needed. It's not easy because it touches very deep things in each one of us.\"\n\nIn 2004, Bel premiered the poignant Veronique Doisneau, in which a retiring ballet dancer stands before a packed audience at the Paris Opera and recounts the physical and emotional sacrifices she has made in her career as a dancer. In similar fashion, the mentally disabled dancers in Disabled Theater begin by telling the audiences about themselves before they start dancing.\n\nWhat's unique, though, about this work is that Bel resisted giving directions to his performers: \"I wanted to find a way where they could be as free as possible on stage because I wanted to show who they were. I directed them as little as possible ... Society wants everybody to obey the same rules. But some cannot; they resist this majority. And I wanted for once to give this freedom to these performers.\"\n\n'Disabled Theater' by Jerome Bel and Theater Hora plays at Sota Drama Centre from Sept 3 to 6 at 8pm. Tickets from S$30 at Sistic\n\nThe best of the rest...\n\nOPERA: FACING GOYA\n\nSINGAPORE'S most renowned director Ong Keng Sen, who is also the festival director of Sifa, will raise the curtain next month with the opera Facing Goya.\n\nComposed by Michael Nyman and directed by Ong himself, with a libretto written by Victoria Hardie, the modern opera examines the debate on social engineering, centred on attempts to clone legendary painter Francisco Goya.\n\nOng says he has always been drawn to \"new opera and new interpretations\" such as those by Tandun and John Adams. He says: \"My entry into music is really the 1960s avant garde. Even though I enjoy the grand and emotional sweep of traditional opera, there's something old-fashioned there that needs to break through.\"\n\nFacing Goya received mixed reviews when it premiered in Spain in 2000, and again for its latest revival which opened in the United States two months ago. Though a portion of the American audience gave it a standing ovation, The New York Times called the vocals \"terrific\" but the music \"taxing\".\n\nThe Singapore show will feature the same cast of singers, including soprano Anne-Carolyn Bird, a regular with the Metropolitan Opera.\n\n'Facing Goya' plays at the Victoria Theatre on Aug 12, 14 and 16 at 8pm. Tickets from S$40 at Sistic\n\nMUSIC: LISTEN TO THE 20TH CENTURY\n\nFOR classical music lovers - a veritable buffet of four acclaimed concerts covering the span of music from the 20th century.\n\nThe London Sinfonietta will collaborate with the Yong Siew Toh Conservatory Orchestra to present a condensed version of a 12 concert-series called The Rest Is Noise, performed last year at London's Southbank Centre.\n\nGillian Moore, Southbank Centre's head of classical music, describes the London Sinfonietta as \"an ensemble of soloists, all of whom play music from all periods, but have a special affinity for 20th century and contemporary music. Some of the musicians hold principal positions in leading UK symphony orchestras, but they come to the London Sinfonietta to satisfy their craving for new and adventurous music. Some of the older Sinfonietta musicians worked extensively with the giants of 20th century music: Stockhausen, Cage, Boulez, and others.\"\n\nThe four concerts will take the audiences through a rich odyssey of music in the 20th century, beginning with early modernists such as Schoenberg, Debussy and Stravinsky in the first concert, then Russian maestros Shostakovich and Prokofiev in the second concert. They will be followed by post-World War II composers such as Stockhausen, Boulez and Ligeti in the third, and finally the more radical Ades, McMillan, Toru Takemitsu and Unsuk Chin in the fourth.\n\n'Listen To The 20th Century' plays at the Sota Concert Hall on Sept 3, 5, 6 and 7 at different times.\n\nEach concert has a different programme.\n\nTickets from S$40 at Sistic\n\nVISUAL ARTS: GIVE ME YOUR BLOOD AND I WILL GIVE YOU FREEDOM\n\nFOR sheer stamina, Nikhil Chopra is hard to beat. The Indian artist will be performing and creating a large painting for 50 hours. The audience can come and go as they please during the two days - though it's recommended that they don't miss the last hours of the show.\n\nThe work owes its title to Subhas Chandra Bose (1897-1945). Bose was the charismatic Indian leader who fought to rid India of British rule. In a speech to rally the Indian National Army on July 4, 1944, Bose cried: \"Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom!\" Responding to his call, a group of women formed the all-female combat army called Rani of Jhansi regiment.\n\nIn his performance, Chopra will assume the character of a female warrior, Jhansi, who must shed her skin and spill her blood. Chopra will simultaneously play the role and paint scenes of a battleground on a massive white canvas. It is no coincidence that the performance will begin on Aug 15, which is India's Independence Day.\n\nChopra is an internationally acclaimed artist known for collapsing the boundary between visual arts and live performance. He typically draws on India's complex colonial history and his personal history to create fictional characters, whom he inhabits for as long as three days. His works have been featured at various galleries, festivals and biennales.\n\n'Give Me Your Blood And I Will Give You Freedom' will unfold at the 72-13, Mohamed Sultan Road, on Aug 15, 7pm, and end on Aug 17, 9pm. Standard priced tickets at S$35 from Sistic\n\nTHEATRE: AMID THE CLOUDS\n\nHUMAN migration is one of the pressing issues of our time. With an estimated 45 million refugees worldwide fleeing their countries and caught in migratory limbos, this poignant and powerful play puts a human face on the bare statistics.\n\nAmid The Clouds centres on two refugees hoping to find a safer, more prosperous country than the one they left behind. Imour (played by Hassan Madjooni) is an illegal immigrant working in a cafe on the Croatian-Slovenian border. Zina (played by Baran Kosari) is an unmarried, pregnant woman escaping persecution in Iran.\n\nDreaming of a better life in the United Kingdom, they travel across the Balkans towards the English Channel, which they must risk their lives to cross.\n\nThe play is written and directed by Amir Reza Koohestani, one of the leading lights of cutting-edge Iranian theatre. Koohestani says he is interested in showing \"the situation of today's human being, notwithstanding borders and nationalities, to stage brief moments of his desires and his regrets while coming to a dead end\".\n\n\"With Amid The Clouds, I got pretty close to my idealistic form of theatre ... the stillness, the directness and the use of lengthy monologue ... The dialogue parts, too, are stripped of any decoration; thus, the unfolding of the story becomes the exclusive focus.\"\n\nhelmi@sph.com.sg\n\n@HelmiBT\n\n'Amid The Clouds' plays at Sota Theatre Studio from Sept 11 to 13 at 8pm.

The overnight policy rate was raised 25 basis points to 3.25 per cent, the first hike in three years. The central bank described the move as \"normalisation\" of monetary policy, presumably a reference to the eventual rate hikes expected in the US post-taper. It's about time.\n\nThere were various reasons for a hike before this. The weak ringgit, for one; negative real interest rates, for another. Given current inflation rates, savings deposit rates are now at minus 0.8 per cent. That's not only depressing but it penalises savers and probably accounts for the drop-off in term, or fixed, deposits that had become apparent since the last quarter of 2013.\n\nIn its policy statement explaining the rate hike, the central bank said that with growth remaining firm but \"with inflation remaining above its long-term average\", it had decided to adjust the degree of monetary accommodation. That's central bankspeak for \"tighten\" and it's easy to see why. Economic growth so far has been robust at 6.2 per cent in the first quarter and all the signs - strong export growth amid resilient domestic demand - point to Q2 growth at around 6 per cent. But inflation was 3.3 per cent in June and is expected to clock in at an average of around 3.6 per cent for the whole of 2014.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Now the property outlook is softening, and they are exploring other asset classes, including Reits,\" said Vikrant Pandey, an analyst at brokerage UOB Kay Hian.\n\nThe 15 per cent stamp duty the Singaporean government imposes on foreign buyers of properties also helps push investors to seek alternatives and Reits have been appealing, Mr Pandey added. \"For the high net-worth individuals, the current 6-7 per cent Reit yield is pretty attractive,\" he said.\n\nWith a portfolio of four properties in Germany, IReit is expected to have an initial focus on Germany and the UK.\n\nDBS Bank Ltd is sole global coordinator for the deal and is a joint bookrunner with Barclays.\n\nMr Tong's holdings in nine Singapore-listed Reits add up to about US$780 million, Thomson Reuters data showed.\n\nHe owns 64.75 per cent of Viva Industrial Trust, 4.58 per cent of Suntec Real Estate Investment Trust, 12.93 per cent of Cambridge Industrial Trust and 16.2 per cent of OUE Commercial Real Estate Investment Trust, among others.- Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nAlibaba to Baidu lead surge in equity-linked bond sales in Asia\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:48 AM\n\nFederal Reserve\u2019s Powell asks watchdog to take fresh look at renovation project: Politico\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:16 AM\n\nTikTok urgently pitches Canada security solution to avoid shutdown\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:07 AM\n\nStablecoin has long road to mainstream payments, Mastercard says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:49 AM\n\nOil\u00a0falls as Trump gives Russia 50 days to avoid new sanctions\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:24 AM\n\nEurope: Shares end lower as Trump\u2019s tariff threats keep markets on edge\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:18 AM\n\nUS: Nasdaq hits new record as markets shrug off tariff talk\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:13 AM\n\nZuckerberg says Meta will invest hundreds of billions in superintelligence\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:48 PM", "images": []}

Stay and watch or be totally freaked out?\n\nFrench choreographer Xavier Le Roy challenges the viewer's notion of an exhibition with a work that he originally created for a museum in Barcelona in 2012, but which has since travelled to the likes of Hamburg, Rio de Janeiro and Paris. He now brings it to 72-13 in Singapore, working with 12 local dancers, and it promises to be a unique \"performed exhibition\" experience. \"It proposes a different relationship to time and space, theatre and exhibition,\" says the choreographer.\n\nIt all started when he was invited by the artistic director of the Antoni Tapi\u00e8s Foundation in Barcelona to make an exhibition with people, not 2D or 3D works. \"And the brief is that viewers can walk in anytime, like they would to a gallery, during opening hours.\"\n\nSo Le Roy came up with a \"choreography of actions\" entitled Retrospective. In Singapore, when visitors walk into the first room, they will see four performers; and in the second room, two performers.\n\nThe dancers will perform excerpts of solo works created by Le Roy from 1994-2010, but frame or retell the movements with their own \"stories\", he explains. Part of the choreography could refer to a sculpture, for example, or a loop of movements like in video art, or tell a narrative kind of story.\n\nThere will also be a section where artists talk to visitors about their lives and their experiences as artists.\n\n\"While the choreographed actions refer to theatre, at the same time, it also refers to an exhibition space,\" explains Le Roy, who studied molecular biology at the University of Montpellier but has worked as a dancer and choreographer since 1991.\n\nIn the second room, two performers will welcome visitors and engage in conversation with them, to make it go beyond the experience they just had in the first room. It's here too, that Le Roy's previous solo dances can be viewed on computers. \"Visitors have a choice of staying for five minutes, or five hours, and come back day after day,\" says Le Roy.\n\nThe title Retrospective doesn't just refer to excerpts from Le Roy's works, he highlights, but in the sense of looking backwards. Incidentally, Le Roy has performed as a dancer twice before in Singapore, at Jubilee Hall (1999) and The Esplanade (2009).\n\n\"Dancers use their own lives and experiences in their choreography as well, after a dialogue with me. The idea is to make a current journey made up of past experiences,\" he says.\n\nIn an exhibition, the works are static so it's up to the individuals to decide what to see and when to move on. In a theatre, a performance is played to a captive audience. Le Roy's Retrospective takes these two experiences and merges them, to present a different challenge on time and space for visitors.\n\n\"The work is also continuously a work in process, and they can change in a day and anytime in the duration of the exhibition,\" he adds. \"This bond is also formed between the performers and the viewers - producing a particular kind of experience.\"\n\nGiven that Le Roy is turning \"exhibition\" and \"performance\" on their heads, what should a viewer come prepared for? \"They should come with a sense of curiosity and a readiness to encounter,\" says Le Roy.\n\n'Retrospective' by Xavier Le Roy is in collaboration with Aaron Khek, Bernice Lee, Chan Sze Wei, Jereh Leong, Joavien Ng, Kai Eng, Loo Zihan, Max Chen, Melinda Lee, Mohd Fared Jainal, Norisham Osman, Scarlet Yu, and Wiing Liu.

BIS - which is known as the bank for central banks - said that even as economies struggle to recover from 2008-09's Great Financial Crisis (GFC), capital markets are \"extraordinarily buoyant\" thanks to the ultra-accommodative policies pursued by central banks and warned them not to fall into the trap of raising rates \"too slowly and too late\".\n\nWorryingly, the response to the BIS report from leading central banks has been denial. On Monday this week, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi told the European Parliament that ultra-low interest rates have not fuelled asset bubbles and that \"macroprudential\" policies were the best defence against bubbles forming.\n\nOn Tuesday, US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen in her Congressional testimony reiterated that the Fed neither was responsible for asset inflation nor should it do anything about it other than to consider \"macroprudential measures\". When asked during the question and answer session that rather than stop bubbles through regulation, it might be better not to have policies that created bubbles in the first place, Ms Yellen said that ultra-low interest rates are needed with the economy performing below its potential, employment below its maximum and inflation remaining below its target. Moreover, she added, hiking interest rates would risk weakening the economy, which could in turn destabilise financial markets.\n\nTherein lies the core of the problem currently confronting central bankers. Having adopted the approach that what is good for the market has to be eventually good for the economy, and having rescued financial markets from a catastrophic collapse in the wake of the GFC, central banks now find themselves unable to reverse this stance - even as stocks rise to dangerously high levels amid a stuttering economic recovery. Granted, raising rates prematurely could choke off the recovery and so using macroprudential measures such as property restrictions and mortgage curbs are well-advised. But to deny that asset bubbles exist or that they are the consequence of monetary policy is risky and ill-advised.\n\nWall Street is now about 150 per cent up from its GFC lows and is at an all-time high, while volatility has virtually disappeared. The VIX Index - which measures the options market's expectations of future volatility - is hovering at a seven-year low, and has been at current levels for several months. This suggests that markets believe that there is no risk present, surely an unnatural state of affairs which bears close watching. Central bankers should take this into account when formulating monetary policy while also acknowledging that their actions are directly responsible for inflating asset prices, possibly beyond fundamentals.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Such deals have often had a positive impact on sentiment and with trading conditions as weak as they are, anything that helps keep interest in local stocks alive is to be welcomed.\n\nHowever, increased corporate activity adds to the challenges that the regulators face in treading a fine line between protecting investors' interests and not stifling those of companies.\n\nConsider, for example, the case of a potential takeover. There have been instances of companies announcing that heightened interest in their shares is probably because talks are underway that could lead to a takeover. The announcements invariably include a qualifier that because of the need for confidentiality, no names can be mentioned, no prices can be quoted and no guarantees can be given.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The guys known collectively as The Four Seasons managed two out of the three: It wasn't an easy ride, but it worked out alright in the end.\n\nAny band with more than a hundred million records sold and a solid catalogue of enduring pop songs - many of them now more than half a century old - must have done something right. Jersey Boys tells the tale of how - despite doing their level best to mess up success - they struck musical gold.\n\nEastwood, a filmmaker with a deliberate storytelling style and a taste for jazz, isn't an obvious choice for this gig, but he must have found something appealing in the stage musical, which has been playing to packed houses for close to a decade. The creators of the musical, Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice, contributed the screenplay here, and don't deviate too far from the original.\n\nThis includes having the primary characters talk directly to the audience, an intimate if sometimes distracting narrative device that draws us naturally into the story. Like the characters it portrays, this film has a take-it-or-leave-it Jersey attitude, and our level of enjoyment depends on how deeply we buy into the conceit. Those classic songs will help tip the scales in its favour.\n\nThe main narrator is Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza), a small-time hood who deals in stolen goods and has a sideline playing in a band with his buddies. After a few false starts, Tommy co-opts young neighbourhood friend Frankie Castelluccio (John Lloyd Young) into the group as lead singer.\n\nThe reason is readily apparent - Frankie's pure, high-pitched voice is a \"gift from God\", opines Gyp DeCarlo (Christopher Walken), the local Mafia boss and Frankie's Number One Fan.\n\nFrankie changes his name to Valley and then Valli. \"'Y' is a bullshit letter,\" advises his wife Mary (Renee Marino), who is soon relegated to a back-up role as frustrated, alcoholic housewife while Frankie and the band - now called The Four Seasons - go on the road as a minor act while also trying to hook onto a record label.\n\nAnother regular member is bassist Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda), who stays in the background - until one memorable scene near the end.\n\nTheir big break comes when they meet Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen), a gifted young songwriter with business savvy who becomes the pivotal fourth member of the band.\n\nHe and Frankie pitch a song to producer Bob Crewe (Mike Doyle) and before you can say \"Who Loves You?\" the Seasons and their distinctive four-part harmony are on their way to stardom with three number one hits and a horde of appreciative fans.\n\nLife in the limelight and on tour takes a heavy toll on relationships, Frankie suffers a personal tragedy and Tommy's selfish, destructive behaviour doesn't endear himself to the others.\n\nBut you better believe they do things differently in Jersey. The music is great of course, but ultimately Jersey Boys is about family, finding yourself - and each other in the process.\n\nRating:\n\nB-\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Some say the segment is already in an upcycle while others say it is too premature to call it a trend.\n\nAn O&M analyst with a major equity research house here pointed out that this wave of upswing has already been going on for a while. \"The momentum has already been there since the later part of last year and just because some companies have won orders in the last couple of weeks coincidentally, it does not necessarily mean that it will create a precedent for orders to really surge,\" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nHowever, he acknowledged that he expects the momentum to continue for a while longer even if it may not result in orders being lumped together to create a trend.\n\n\"If you look at Tidewater, one of the largest OSV (offshore support vessel) builders listed in the US, their CEO recently said that the industry is in an extended period of upcycle. He feels that some of the analysts out there have an overly bearish outlook on the sector and he does not agree with them,\" said the analyst.\n\nThe main underlying driver of this extended upcyle, this analyst explained, were oil prices remaining firm and high. \"(Oil) prices have actually stayed above US$100 per barrel for the last two to three years and remain the underlying driver for offshore activities. In the past, even when there was a period of strong supply growth, at that point of time when oil prices were relatively weak, at around US$80 per barrel, that was more of a cause of concern.\"\n\nEven though he admitted that oil prices are expected to come down a bit, they will stay at a relatively healthy level for offshore activities to continue and is one of the key reasons why the optimism has actually remained in the O&M sector.\n\nMoreover, with a large order book of rigs standing, there will be a greater demand for OSVs, particularly larger ones, to support the number of rigs coming in. He also pointed out that since about 25 per cent of the current offshore fleet is more than 25 years old, there will be quite a lot of capital coming in for refreshment of these fleets.\n\nSome others were a little less optimistic about this being a wave and also if the orders will continue at the same levels.\n\nSince the recent contracts won have been for different products and not from the same segment, it was also difficult to infer if this was any trend, Lim Siew Khee of CIMB said. \"(However), I am still expecting orders to come in, but it will probably not be a lot and may not exceed last year's amount.\"\n\nLee Yue Jer of OSK-DMG acknowledged that even though the surge of orders coming in for companies here may be a coincidence, he does see a tightening of the OSV market over the next two years. \"The supply of the OSVs is getting tighter so rates are being bid up and utilisation levels (of vessels) are going up as well.\"\n\nMr Lee highlighted, however, that even within the OSV market the increase of rates and utilisation levels was more prevalent within the shallow OSV market as deepwater vessels continue to be under pressure.\n\n\"I do expect (this trend) to continue. Shallow water will continue to do well and I see that as a safer region to be in because the oil majors are cutting capex (capital expenditure) and a lot of the cuts are not being done evenly across the spectrum,\" he said.\n\nHe explained that since deepwater work is riskier, with a longer exploration time and payback period, the spending cuts by oil majors are generally falling harder on deepwater OSVs than shallow-water OSVs.\n\nIt seems that although the current surge of orders may only be a coincidence, there is reason to believe that the upturn the sector has seen in the last year will continue for a while longer and especially for the shallow-water OSV market.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Under such terms, the reserves cannot be counted towards a company, which books only its share of revenue from oil sales.\n\nRex also said then that it will invest only in assets that have been scanned - either in whole or in part - with the Rex Virtual Drilling (RVD) technology, since this proprietary technology lowers the risk of drilling dry wells.\n\nWhere RVD has not been used, any negative drilling result could affect the public perception of the firm and its proprietary technologies \"in a most severe and adverse way\", Rex said. \"This has been identified by the company as a key risk which must be mitigated.\"\n\nRVD enables the group to \"see oil in the ground\" by pinpointing the location of oil reservoirs below the ground surface, in what Rex says is the world's first hydrocarbon detector using seismic data.\n\nRex's chief executive officer Mans Lidgren said in yesterday's announcement: \"While the field is a conventionally attractive asset, it does not fulfil our investment criteria as it is not covered with adequate recent 3D seismic data to be effectively derisked with RVD. We are pleased that the field fits well into LGO's operations and growth plans in Trinidad.\"\n\nAfter the divestment, Caribbean Rex will still have in Trinidad and Tobago a 100 per cent working interest in the South Erin block in south-west Trinidad, and a 20 per cent interest in Cory Moruga in southern onshore Trinidad. The latter will be increased to 51 per cent when the group finishes its drilling obligations at the end of the year.\n\nUnder the agreement, if the transaction is not completed by Sept 27 due to LGO Trinidad \"acting without cause\", the firm will pay a US$250,000 break fee to Caribbean Rex.\n\nOn the stock market yesterday, Rex's shares rose 0.5 cent to close at 65 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This cuts its stake in Biosensors from 21.78 per cent to 19.46 per cent.\n\nIn a note to clients, CIMB said that the fund could be pulling out of Biosensors, putting to rest earlier speculation of a takeover offer. CIMB has a \"hold\" call on the stock, with a target price of $1.01.\n\nIn February, Bloomberg had reported that Citic was considering buying out the medical devices maker. The China-based fund had acquired the stake in Biosensors last year from Shandong Weigao Group Medical Polymer Co.\n\n\"We do not like the management changes and restructuring within Biosensors,\" CIMB said in the note. \"Also, management has hinted that they are going back into the balloon catheter market. If we go along the line with what the medical world is thinking, (a) new wave of balloon catheters could spell the end to stents. That is the reason medical giants from Abbott Lab, Metronic, Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson are focusing their efforts in the balloon catheters market.\"\n\nIt noted that while the company's fundamentals haven't turned bad overnight, its corporate governance has taken a \"big hit\".\n\nFor FY14, Biosensors reported a revenue of US$323.8 million, down 4 per cent year-on-year as product revenue growth was offset by lower licensing and royalty revenue.\n\nNet profit for the financial year ended March 31, 2014, worked out to US$40.6 million (including exceptional items), down from US$115.5 million previously.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This offering also includes an international placement of units to investors outside the US.\n\nAt the same time, Wealthy Fountain Holdings Inc and Tong Jinquan have entered into a separate subscription agreement with the trust's manager to subscribe for a total of 253,882,000 trust units at the offering price. Mr Tong owns Shanghai Summit Pte Ltd, which in turn owns 65 per cent of IREIT Global Group Pte Ltd.\n\nThe manager also plans to draw down 96.6 million euros (S$162.5 million) from a term loan facility that it has with DekaBank Deutsche Girozentrale immediately prior to the listing date.\n\nThe trust's IPO portfolio will be made up of four office properties in Germany, with an aggregate net lettable area of 121,506 square metres. These four freehold properties are valued at about $483 million, according to the preliminary prospectus.\n\nAssuming a listing date of July 1, 2014, IREIT Global's gross revenue forecast for the six months ending Dec 31, 2014, stands at 10.9 million euros. Its income available for distribution to unitholders stand at 8.3 million euros.\n\nBased on the offering price, its distribution per unit for that period is forecast at 3.33 cents, assuming a foreign exchange rate of one euro to S$1.70. This works out to an expected annualised distribution yield of 7.6 per cent.\n\nIREIT's policy is to distribute 100 per cent of its annual distributable income for the period from the listing date to Dec 31, 2016, and at least 90 per cent of its annual distributable income after that.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth/wealth-investing/value-stocks-get-upper-hand", "site_title": "Value stocks get the upper hand", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nValue stocks get the upper hand\n\nGrowth investing has ceded ground to value investing in the US, with many growth investors taking their lumps, especially in smaller stocks\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Jul 15, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIN 2013, the Buffalo Emerging Opportunities fund returned a stunning 61.7 per cent. Lipper, which tracks mutual funds, named it the best small-capitalisation growth fund over the previous three and five years, and investors stormed in. It began 2013 with just US$66 million in assets and attracted US$380 million in new money for the year.\n\nBut in the first half of this year, even after a June rebound, the fund was down 6.66 per cent, badly trailing the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which had total returns, with dividends, of 7.14 per cent. The fund also had net outflows of US$97.6 million.\n\nThe portfolio manager, John Bichelmeyer, is philosophical about the reversal. \"It's a healthy correction,\" he said. \"Sometimes you take your lumps.\"\n\nIn the tug of war between growth and value investing, value has gained ground, and many growth investors have taken their lumps, especially in smaller stocks. Growth stocks promise above-average expansion in revenue and profit; value stocks are deemed relatively cheap as gauged by ratios such as price-earnings and price-book.\n\nCorporate earnings growth\n\nMutual funds that focus on large-cap value stocks returned 7 per cent, on average, in the first half of the year; those concentrating on mid-cap value stocks returned 7.8 per cent, according to Morningstar.\n\nLarge-cap growth funds had gains of 4.7 per cent, while mid-cap growth funds were up 4 per cent. Small-cap growth funds were hit hard this spring but recovered some momentum in June and ended up 0.9 per cent, on average, for the first six months. But small-cap value funds gained 4.7 per cent.\n\nExchange traded funds that track both mid-cap and large-cap value stocks have done especially well this year. The mid-cap Guggenheim S&P 500 Pure Value ETF and the PowerShares Fundamental Pure Mid-Value ETF were each up roughly 10 per cent through June. The PowerShares Dynamic Large-Cap Value ETF returned just under 8 per cent.\n\nBrian Belski, chief strategist at BMO Capital Markets, said that the run on value stocks was not likely to end soon, in part because he expected the economy to improve and to bolster corporate earnings. \"When corporate earnings growth is expanding, it's positive for value,\" he said.\n\nBMO screens for value stocks using several criteria. It seeks companies that haven't had an earnings loss in the previous two years and those that have less debt than equity and have price-earnings and price-book ratios lower than those of the overall Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.\n\nAmong large-cap stocks that clear these screens are Norfolk Southern, UnitedHealth Group, Target and Principal Financial Group. Mr Belski specifically cites the financial sector as having \"a lot of long-term value\".\n\nBrian Boyle, who manages the large-cap Valley Forge fund, also sees value in financials. \"They've been raising capital,\" he noted, adding that \"reserves for loan losses are more than sufficient\".\n\nThe Valley Forge fund holds shares and warrants of Bank of America, which has faced problems stemming from the mortgage crisis. Despite that, \"they have tremendous core earnings capacity\", he said.\n\nBank of America can earn US$2 a share beginning in 2018, he estimated, versus 75 US cents a share in the trailing 12 months through March 2014.\n\nAt less than US$16 on June 30, its shares traded at less than eight times what he called \"normalised\" earnings.\n\nValue investors often pride themselves on the ability to overlook bad news that may prompt others to overreact. When Wall Street downgrades a stock, \"that for us is an invitation to opportunity\", said Matthew P Kaufler, co-manager of the Federated Clover Value fund.\n\nSenior management changes and corporate restructuring often lower share prices, which may create a buying opportunity, he said. \"There's a contrarian streak in what we do.\"\n\nThe troubles at General Motors (GM) are creating a contrarian opportunity, he said. GM has recalled millions of vehicles for an ignition switch problem that the automaker has linked to at least 13 deaths. \"The recall issue is very well publicised, very real,\" he said.\n\nYet he is optimistic about the stock. \"My sense is that as they put this problem behind them, GM's stock is going to be a lot higher,\" he said.\n\nHillshire Brands is a value bet that has already paid off for his fund. When it bought shares in the first quarter, Mr Kaufler said, the company was under-appreciated. \"It was trading at a discount to its private market value,\" he said. \"It was at least a 20 per cent discount.\"\n\nWith Pilgrim's Pride and Tyson Foods making buyout bids for the company, Hillshire shares climbed to just over US$62 at the end of the quarter from a mid-May price of around US$36.\n\nOften, no bright line separates growth and value stocks. \"There are quite a few value stocks that have under-appreciated growth potential,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Fund Management.\n\n\"There are also growth stocks trading at a significant discount to intrinsic value.\" Such \"mispricing\" creates buying opportunities, he said.\n\nHe cited the energy sector, which typically falls under the value umbrella. Many oil and gas drillers, using fracking technologies, have strong growth potential, and the market has rewarded them with premium prices, making them growth stocks.\n\nBut Mr Jacobsen said some service and engineering companies that support the shale drillers were still selling as cheaply priced value stocks.\n\nHe also said he thought worries over Chinese economic growth had excessively punished some Asian companies. He cited South Korean semiconductor companies as growth stocks that had been marked down and were \"very attractive\".\n\n'Spectacular' profit margins\n\nJames T Swanson, chief investment strategist at MFS Investment Management, said \"spectacular\" profit margins had allowed many large caps to grow without taking on debt. This, too, has enhanced the value appeal of some growth stocks.\n\nNet margins for the top 200 companies in the S&P 500 were 9.9 per cent, on average, in the first quarter, far above the 50-year average of 4.5 per cent.\n\nIs this superior performance sustainable? Mr Swanson says he thinks it will be, at least for a while. Low interest rates and relatively low corporate tax payments have contributed to margin expansion, he said, and this should be sustained. And the low price of natural gas has aided many manufacturers.\n\nHe also noted fundamental structural factors that were unlikely to disappear overnight. Workers, for example, are likely to continue to fall short in sharing gains of the economic recovery.\n\n\"The labour component of the economy is not getting its share of GDP,\" he said. \"That's good for the owners of capital.\" - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom: survey\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

Reasons cited include lower net property income and higher profit expense incurred on higher borrowings.\n\nThe Syariah-compliant industrial Reit said that the Q2 DPU was largely unchanged from Q1's 1.88 cents. \"This was despite an increase in unit base by approximately 2.7 million as a result of new units issued in Q2 2014 under the distribution re-investment plan established in April this year,\" it said.\n\nHigher property expenses led net property income to fall 9.3 per cent to $18.4 million.\n\nThe distribution will be paid on Aug 19, but unitholders may choose to receive their distributions in units instead of cash.\n\nFor the quarter, its gross revenue rose 17.6 per cent to $25.4 million, thanks to contributions from 508 Chai Chee Lane acquired last September, and higher turnover from 151 Lorong Chuan, which was converted into a multi-tenanted lease arrangement in Q4 last year.\n\nFor its half year, DPU was 22.2 per cent lower at 3.74 cents. Net property income fell 9.3 per cent to $36.7 million, while gross revenue rose 15.9 per cent to $49.9 million.\n\nAs at end-June, the Reit had outstanding borrowings of $455.8 million, of which 91 per cent was effectively fixed. Its weighted average debt tenor stood at 2.5 years, with $10.2 million due for refinancing in November this year.\n\nIts portfolio occupancy stood at 90.8 per cent, steady from a quarter ago. The Reit secured six new leases and 12 lease rene-wals in the quarter.\n\nAcknowledging slowing growth in Singapore's ma-nufacturing, stagnant capital values and rents for industrial space, as well as JTC's new subletting policy which reduces the minimum space that can be leased by non-anchor tenants, the Reit said: \"The market conditions are expected to remain challenging.\n\n\"We will continue to intensify our marketing and leasing efforts to improve our portfolio occupancy. We will also continue to make selective acquisitions. In addition, we will look for opportunities to recycle our capital by divesting underperforming assets,\" it added.\n\nUnits of the Reit closed half a cent lower at $1.045 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This implies a possible sharp increase in yields and a drop in bond prices if views begin to converge on the positive side, analysts say.\n\nHowever, a BOJ official sought to allay fears on this yesterday, saying that continued heavy buying of JGBs by the central bank should serve to prevent any sharp jump in bond yields, and that \"stress tests\" had shown Japanese financial institutions to be able to absorb sudden falls in bond prices.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Kuroda said that domestic demand in Japan, including capital expenditure, remained firm, and that a virtuous cycle in economic activity was clearly in place. Companies expected to increase spending, reflecting increases in sales and profits and corporate appetite for spending remained strong.\n\nHowever, he acknowledged at the same time that \"from the medium to long-term perspective, a country's economic growth is determined by production capacity, so efforts to boost production capacity are necessary\".\n\nMr Kuroda also admitted during the briefing that some members of the nine-member BOJ policy board held what he called \"more cautious views\" of the BOJ's ability to achieve its 2 per cent inflation target by the middle of next year.\n\nHe argued that while the effects from energy prices had begun to fade, downward pressure from this would be offset by tightening labour market conditions. The two factors will offset each other, keeping consumer inflation at around one per cent. \"As the effects from energy prices begin to disappear, price rises will begin to accelerate. Price rises are broadening and are expected to continue broadening, allowing for consumer inflation to diverge towards 2 per cent.\"\n\nBoth corporate prices and wages are on the rise, he added.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England appear to be heading towards an exit from quantitative monetary easing earlier than other major central banks, Mr Kuroda noted, but he rejected the idea that this could put pressure on the BOJ to begin contemplating an exit.\n\n\"There will probably be something to learn from their exit strategies, but Japan and the US each have their own appropriate means and timing for when to exit, reflecting their economic and financial conditions. So it's not a case of other central banks automatically following in the Fed's footsteps.\"\n\nThe policy board voted yesterday to keep in place the BOJ current monetary policy, which is designed to increase Japan's monetary base by around 60 trillion yen (S$734 billion) to 70 trillion yen annually through monthly purchases of JGBs totalling around 50 trillion yen.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The others on trial are Ms Ho's husband, senior pastor and co-founder Kong Hee, deputy senior pastor Tan Ye Peng, finance manager Sharon Tan and former finance manager and board member Serina Wee.\n\nChew, in a clear break from the others, quit the church in June last year; he also discharged his lawyer, Senior Counsel Michael Khoo, and is now defending himself.\n\nWhen his turn came to cross-examine Lam, he challenged the latter's assertion that it was Chew who came to Lam with the idea of setting up Xtron Productions to manage CHC's evangelical effort, the Crossover Project. Through his line of questioning, Chew accused Lam of submitting false evidence:\n\n\"Mr Lam, I'm putting it to you right now: I didn't approach you, I didn't have this grand vision of a media events company. I had a full-time job - State Street Bank at the time. I was not into entertainment, nor into concerts; I wouldn't even have had the time to think about it.\n\n\"So I put it to you that the evidence you have given to the court - that it was my idea - is false.\"\n\nLam maintained that he had testified that Chew was the originator of the idea because it was Chew who approached him in May 2003 about having Xtron act as the artiste manager for Ms Ho. Chew argued that, since this hearing began, Lam has had sight of e-mails that showed that Chew was not the originator of the idea; the correspondence showed that others - included Kong and Tan Ye Peng - were discussing the idea before Chew came into the picture.\n\nChew said to Lam: \"These two e-mails (exhibits), E-653, E-281, weren't they already in your hands since the trial started? So, you would have read them before you gave your statement.\"\n\nLam replied: \"My statement was that, at the time, in May 2003, I had no knowledge that someone else was asking (Chew) Eng Han to tell me to set up Xtron . . . because it was Eng Han who approached me about being a director in Xtron.\"\n\nTo which, Chew said: \"Mr Lam, I'm not asking for your recollection of May 2003. I'm asking for your recollection since the trial started - you would have access to these two e-mails, and you would have gone through them. And (I'm) asking - (having) read through those e-mails, how could you come up with the statement that it was Chew Eng Han who started Xtron?\"\n\nAt which point, Chief District Judge See Kee Oon stepped in: \"Mr Chew, you are basically saying that Mr Lam has given evidence which is at least inaccurate. So, do you agree with this, Mr Lam?\"\n\nAt this point, Lam conceded, replying: \"Your Honour, yes, I agree.\"\n\nSenior Counsel N Sreenivasan, who is representing Sharon Tan, pointed out Chew's lack of legal credentials, but this has been a shortfall to which Chew has not been adverse to admitting.\n\nWhen he opened his cross-examination of Lam, he had quipped: \"I would just like to make a bit of a request: when the counsel in front, when you hand out new exhibits, don't forget there's a little junior counsel here. I need some of the documents too.\"\n\nAt another point, following an argument between the prosecution and defence counsel over a point of law, Chew said: \"I don't understand what all these counsel are saying.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But in the first half of this year, trusts lent real estate firms 39 per cent less than in the previous six months, according to trust research company Use Trust based in Nanchang. At the same time, the average interest on 48.3 billion yuan (S$9.67 billion) in loans made through wealth management products climbed 16 basis points to 9.67 per cent.\n\nThat bodes ill for Chinese developers who must repay nearly 600 billion yuan worth of trust loans next year, according to brokerage firm Jefferies. \"Default risk is heightening because trusts rely heavily on house prices rising,\" said Xie Ya Xuan, an economist at China Merchants Securities' Research and Development Center in Shenzhen.\n\nTrust firms, under greater scrutiny from regulators worried about rapid growth of shadow banking, are finding it harder to raise money themselves and growing wary of lending to developers, particularly smaller ones, while the market cools.\n\nNew home prices in China fell last month for the third straight month, private sector surveys show, as some developers cut prices to spur sales, with many expected to offer steeper cuts as they scramble to meet this year's sales targets.\n\nThat could squeeze developers with trust loans coming due in the next 12 to 18 months as a supply glut clouds the outlook for the property sector.\n\nWith its 15 per cent share of China's economy and direct impact on 40 other sectors, many economists identify a property market downturn as the main risk to Beijing's 7.5 per cent growth target for this year.\n\nTightening credit conditions make it tougher for developers to refinance and roll over their trust loans.\n\nTotal funding for real estate developers this year added up to 4.7 trillion yuan at the end of May, up 3.6 percent from a year earlier, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. It marks a significant slowdown from a 32 per cent growth in the same period of 2013. \"If the trust loan can't be rolled over, then the company will be in trouble,\" said an executive at a Hong Kong-listed developer who declined to be named.\n\nWhile trusts are cutting their exposure to small developers, they appear to be ramping up loans to bigger companies. Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd, ranked as China's third largest developer by sales in the first six months, raised 3.3 billion yuan by July 7 via trust loan products for its projects this year, according to Use Trust.\n\nEvergrande declined to comment.\n\nTrust companies said that they have become more selective over real-estate related refinancing projects and they prefer infrastructure investments over property as they are usually backed by governments.\n\n\"We basically don't do developers smaller than provincial level or small to mid-sized developers anymore,\" said a trust manager at Minmetals International Trust Co Ltd, who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nBigger is not necessarily safer. Because these project loans are classified as equity rather than debt, they can make a company's balance sheet look healthier than it is. Barclays pointed out last month that Evergrande's total debt-to-equity ratio would be a steep 220 per cent if all its funding sources were counted as debt. \"We believe the company is over-leveraged, especially with regard to its perpetual securities products, and this may bring in a painful punch should sales continue to slow,\" Barclays analyst Alvin Wong wrote in a note to clients.\n\nTrust loans came into the spotlight this year after several delayed payments and defaults.\n\nLast month, China Ting Group Holdings said that it was unable to receive two interest payments for its HK$200 million (S$32.1 million) entrusted loans to Hangzhou-based developer Zhongdou Group, who was reportedly in two billion yuan debt. A Jiangsu shipbuilder also said in April that a 105 million yuan entrusted loan to a Nanjing developer was defaulted. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

There are lots of choices in products out there - many airlines and plenty of options to tailor your travel experience - but in today's world, it is not always easy to access these options. For example, you may be able to book extra leg room on an airline website, but it is much more difficult if you make the same request through a travel agent - even an online one.\n\nSpeak a new language\n\nWhy? Because travel agents rely on tried-and-tested systems that were largely developed before the Internet became available. They literally speak a different language. And that language does not have the capability to describe easily additional products and services that might be available, such as a seat with more leg room, a special meal or priority boarding.\n\nThat probably helps to explain why two-thirds of people usually choose to customise their travel via airline websites rather than through travel agents, said Iata's 2013 Global Passenger Survey.\n\nThis could soon change. Working with other partners in the industry, Iata is building standards for a new language for buying travel products called New Distribution Capability (NDC). When it is deployed, travellers who wish to use a travel agent or travel website will have access to a much richer shopping experience, with the ability to compare options based on full descriptions, including photos and videos.\n\nIata also wants to make things smoother and more convenient at the airport. It knows that air travellers do not like to stand in long lines to check in their bags and that many are comfortable doing more things themselves in return for shorter waiting times.\n\nIata's 2013 Global Passenger Survey found out that two-thirds of passengers would prefer to check in online or automatically by receiving a text message or e-mail from the airline.\n\nOnly 11 per cent prefer receiving their boarding passes from an agent at an airport check-in counter.\n\nThis is the premise behind Iata's Fast Travel project - to create more opportunities for air travellers to do things for themselves through six time-saving, self-service options covering many of the processes that travellers go through at an airport, from checking in to boarding the aircraft.\n\nDo a better job\n\nSimultaneously, Iata is looking at ways to do an even better job of reuniting passengers with their bags. Currently, just one per cent of bags are mishandled, but we want to reduce that to 0.5 per cent - less than one in every 100 by 2020, through the Innovation in Baggage (InBag) programme.\n\nThe agency is also targeting long lines at security checkpoints though Smart Security, a joint initiative with Airports Council International, which represents the world's airports. Smart Security aims to improve security by using information that governments already collect to allocate security resources where they are most needed. Simultaneously, by encouraging governments to invest in state-of-the-art screening machines and being smarter about some of the processes, much of the hassle associated with queuing and disrobing can be removed.\n\nThis year, Iata will conduct airport trials with Smart Security components at airports in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nWe are very excited by all of these efforts, but the industry needs regulators to do their part by keeping pace. An example is home-printed bag tags. Passengers like the option to bring their bags to the airport already tagged, and airlines have shown that they work. Now, governments need to do their part by making sure that regulations do not prevent this.\n\nCommercial aviation has come a long way since that very first flight 100 years ago. As commercial aviation moves into its second century, we look forward to giving passengers a smoother and more valuable travel experience, with less hassle.\n\nThe writer is the director-general and chief executive officer of Iata\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The measure touched 15.1 on July 8, the lowest in seven years. It climbed 4.5 per cent last week, compared with surges of 17 per cent on the benchmark US volatility index and 25 per cent in Europe.\n\nJapanese stocks have been aided by public institutions for more than a year. Unprecedented central-bank easing drove a 57 per cent jump for the Nikkei 225 in 2013, and expectations of inflows from the nation's biggest pension fund helped spur a 9.2 per cent rebound from a May low. The gauge will climb another 7.9 per cent by year-end, according to the average of 13 forecasts in a survey by Bloomberg News this month.\n\n\"There's been an enormous rally in the Japanese market,\" said Tim Schroeders, a portfolio manager who helps oversee US$1 billion in equities at Pengana Capital Ltd in Melbourne. \"Risks over the direction of the yen, which could negatively affect the exporters, haven't been priced in. Japan is on the right track but a lot of the stocks are probably priced to perfection.\"\n\nThe calm in Japan's stock market is mirrored in sovereign-bond trading. Historical price volatility on Japanese government bonds slid to a record low of 0.647 per cent on June 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg going back to December 1994.\n\nVolatility reignited\n\nThe Nikkei 225 volatility gauge added 0.5 per cent to 15.42 in Tokyo yesterday, as the underlying stock measure rose 0.6 per cent. Concern about financial stability in Portugal reignited US and European volatility last week, with the CBOE Volatility Index, the gauge of S&P 500 options prices known as the VIX, jumping 17 per cent to 12.1. That pared its decline this year to 12 per cent. The measure's European counterpart, the VStoxx Index, surged 25 per cent to 16.3 last week and has slipped 5.3 per cent in 2014.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan have purchased trillions of US dollars of debt to stimulate their economies. The European Central Bank last month became the first major policy- maker to charge fees on deposits, and is using measures including targeted loans to pump money into the region's financial system.\n\n\"Central bank stimulus provides a floor on risky assets, particularly in Japan,\" said Hans Goetti, a Singapore- based fund manager at Banque Internationale a Luxembourg SA, which manages about US$40 billion. \"The Japanese equity rally that started in May is to a large extent supported by public money.\"\n\nThe BOJ yesterday kept its record stimulus unchanged and forecast inflation will pick up to its 2 per cent price target. The central bank stuck with its goal of an annual increase in the monetary base of between 60 trillion yen (S$733.5 billion) and 70 trillion yen, it said in a statement in Tokyo, as forecast by all 34 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.\n\nIn Asia's second-largest stock market, the HSI Volatility Index tracking option costs in Hong Kong slid 2.3 per cent this year to 13.2. Chinese officials are rolling out targeted stimulus to help the nation reach its goal of 7.5 per cent growth, while shunning the large-scale quantitative easing undertaken by the Fed and BOJ. \"You do have probably a bit more to be worried about in China than in Japan,\" said Stuart Beavis, head of institutional equity derivatives at Vantage Capital in Hong Kong. \"There's optimism in Japan given the huge amount of economic stimulus from the central bank. While recent economic data in China is improving, people aren't getting carried away.\"\n\nYen's steep gain\n\nJapan's industrial production rebounded in May, indicating that manufacturers are riding out a sales-tax increase as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe seeks to steer the economy through its aftermath. Still, machinery orders plunged that month by the most on record, a July 10 report showed.\n\nAfter climbing as much as 12 per cent from a May 21 low, the broader Topix index fell 2.3 per cent last week as the yen capped its steepest weekly gain against the US dollar since April. Shares on the Nikkei 225 traded at 17.3 times estimated earnings on Monday, even after the gauge dropped 6.1 per cent this year. The multiple for the Topix was 14.2 times, compared with 16.6 times for the S&P 500.\n\nThe most-owned options on the Nikkei 225 are 16,000 calls expiring in December, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The gauge closed yesterday at 15,395.16. Investors held 1.09 bearish contracts on the Japanese measure for every bullish one last week. Options pricing in a 10 per cent decline cost 4.5 points more than wagers betting on a 10 per cent increase, three-month implied-volatility data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nInvestors who are bullish on Japan point to fiscal and monetary stimulus as well as the Government Pension Investment Fund's move to increase investments in Japanese equities. The nation will cut its corporate tax rate to below 30 per cent over five years, Economy Minister Akira Amari said on July 3. The US$1.2 trillion GPIF will probably complete its asset-allocation review this autumn, Yasuhiro Yonezawa, the head of its investment committee, said on July 9. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg in May expect the fund to increase its Japanese stock target to 20 per cent from 12 per cent.\n\n\"We remain overweight on Japan,\" said Khiem Do, Hong Kong-based head of Asian multi-asset strategy at Baring Asset Management Ltd, which oversees about US$55 billion. \"Japanese shares should benefit from the proposed cut in the corporate income tax rate and GPIF investments.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom: survey\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

Housing \"has shown little recent progress\" as higher mortgage rates discourage buyers.\n\nThe jobless rate fell to an almost six-year low of 6.1 per cent last month, close to the level most Fed officials predicted for the end of the year. Payrolls surged by 288,000 workers, boosting the average monthly advance so far this year to almost 231,000.\n\nEven so, some of the labour market gauges watched by Ms Yellen show continued weakness. The participation rate, which measures the share of working-age people in the labour force, was 62.8 per cent last month, matching the lowest since 1978. Among the unemployed, about a third have been out of work for six months or longer.\n\nEven before the latest jobs report, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants raised their projections for the level of the main interest rate over the next two years, while continuing to predict that the first increase would occur next year.\n\nEconomists are predicting growth will snap back from a first-quarter contraction as an improving job outlook and stock-market gains boost consumer confidence and spending.\n\nGross domestic product (GDP) will expand 3.1 per cent from July to December following a 3.3 per cent advance last quarter, according to the median forecast of 74 economists polled by Bloomberg from July 3 to 9.\n\nIt would be the first time since 2004-2005 that GDP has sustained such gains over an extended period.\n\n\"Economic activity will expand at a moderate pace over the next several years, supported by accommodative monetary policy, a waning drag from fiscal policy, the lagged effects of higher home prices and equity values, and strengthening foreign growth,\" Ms Yellen said.\n\nA pick-up in inflation towards the central bank's 2 per cent objective has also prompted some officials to say the Fed may have to consider tightening sooner. The Fed's preferred gauge, the personal consumption expenditures index, rose 1.8 per cent from a year earlier in May, the most in 19 months.\n\n\"Inflation has moved up in recent months but remains below the FOMC's 2 per cent objective for inflation over the longer run,\" Ms Yellen said.\n\nThe subdued expansion may warrant keeping rates low for some time even after employment and inflation are back to normal levels, Ms Yellen said, while repeating her warning last month that the economic outlook is uncertain and rates also may need to be raised sooner.\n\n\"Decisions about the path of the federal funds rate remain dependent on our assessment of incoming information and the implications for the economic outlook,\" Ms Yellen said. \"Should the labour market continue improving more quickly than anticipated, rate increases likely would occur sooner and be more rapid than currently envisioned.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

United Kingdom property company Bruntwood will develop the hotel on behalf of M&L Hospitality while Cycas Hospitality, which is M&L's operator for their Stratford City hotels, will manage the business.\n\nSaid Neil Maxwell, chief executive officer of M&L Hospitality: \"We are always exploring investment opportunities that have the potential to deliver stable and attractive returns. The UK hotel market continues to achieve solid performance and we are excited about the growth of internationally branded hotels here.\"\n\nThe development forms part of the university's \u00a31 billion Campus Masterplan which will create some of the most modern campus facilities in the world. M&L Hospitality said that it expects demand for the rooms to be driven by the new executive education centre adjoining the hotel complex, nearby science park and university hospitals, and its close proximity to Manchester City.\n\nFounded in 2009, M&L Hospitality is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Grandline International backed by the Kum family. The group, which had previously abandoned two separate attempts at an initial public offering here, has an international portfolio of 14 hotels around the world.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But several condos before Spring Grove have similarly asked for ambitious reserve prices and seen their deals lapse and expire without a buyer. The same fate seems likely for Spring Grove, consultants say.\n\nYesterday, Knight Frank, the marketing agent representing the condo unit owners, promoted the site as being \"one of the few residential plots remaining in the Orchard area to be made available for redevelopment into a large-scale luxury condominium\".\n\n\"Spring Grove is located in the very heart of the core central region (CCR) where there is a limited supply of land,\" Knight Frank's director & head of investment and capital markets, Ian Loh said.\n\nTrue enough, the enormous 263,513 sq ft site can be developed into a maximum gross floor area of 553,377 sq ft.\n\nSpring Grove currently comprises three blocks of 20-storey apartments with 325 units, plus the conserved Victorian-styled Spring Grove House - previously an ambassadorial residence and home to several renowned businessmen in Singapore, now integrated within the development as a clubhouse.\n\nBut the sheer size of the plot, coupled with its large price quantum which translates into a hefty $2,512 psf per plot ratio, will also likely deter developers, analysts said.\n\nThe reserve price of $1.39 billion includes a lease top-up premium for a fresh 103-year lease, to be paid to the US government, but Knight Frank's Mr Loh declined to reveal the sum of the top-up.\n\nThe tricky nature of the site is such that it has a 99-year lease which started in 1991 and reverts back to the US government at the end of the tenure as freehold land. A draft collective sale agreement obtained by The Straits Times last year put the top-up sum at $121 million, assuming a land price of $1.045 billion.\n\nCommenting on the price tag, CBRE research head Desmond Sim said: \"$1.39 billion is purely just the land cost, without including construction cost yet. It would almost definitely require at least a joint venture to pump so much equity and take on the higher developmental risks, given the large quantum.\"\n\nSLP International executive director Nicholas Mak added that a developer with a budget of $1.39 billion can, with the same amount of money, buy about four plots on average from government land sales (GLS) and still have change leftover.\n\n\"Every developer has a certain war chest, a certain budget. A developer will ask, 'Do I want to spread out my money over four GLS sites or do I want to put so many eggs in one basket?',\" he said.\n\nOne reason for the expensive price tag could simply be due to demand from Spring Grove's own unit owners for higher compensation. BT earlier reported that the condo's sales committee had to raise the price after its offer of $2,100 psf in March last year failed to obtain the requisite consensus from residents.\n\nThe en bloc sale market has been quiet in recent years, a marked change from 2005 to 2008, when homebuyers' demand for high-end projects led to developers rushing to replenish their land bank through en bloc sales.\n\nBut with loan curbs now restricting high-value purchases, this has tempered homebuyers' demand for luxury homes and in turn killed off appetite among developers for land in Singapore's prime residential region.\n\nAn optimistic Mr Loh nevertheless believes that subsequent new condos on the site can break even at around $3,400 to $3,500 psf.\n\n\"Luxury apartments in the new development could be sold for $3,800-$4,200 psf if it is launched for sale within the next few years,\" he said, taking reference from units at the nearby TwentyOne Angullia Park and Orchard Residences.\n\nThe tender for Spring Grove will close at 3pm on Sept 10, 2014. If it closes without a suitable bid, a 10-week private treaty period will ensue to allow for private negotiations, so the agent effectively has until March 22, 2015 to find a buyer and file an application to strata-title the plot.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Chicago-based planemaker may quickly punch back: it is close to announcing jet purchases valued at as much as US$9.2 billion by Air Lease Corp and BOC Aviation Ltd, people familiar with the talks said.\n\nAirbus' fast start at the event outside London was welcome news for a company that amassed only 290 net aircraft orders after cancellations during the first half, trailing Boeing's 499.\n\nToulouse, France-based Airbus also used the show's opening day to offer an upgraded version of the A330 wide-body, reaping a US$6.9 billion deal.\n\n\"Airbus has a fondness for airshow fireworks,\" Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Fairfax, Virginia-based Teal Group, said.\n\nThe annual forum, which alternates between Paris and Farnborough, spotlights the competition between Airbus and Boeing for global sales supremacy. The event brings together manufacturers, airlines, lessors, suppliers and inventors for a flurry of meetings and dealmaking.\n\nAirbus owed part of its first-day show bounce to lessors, whose support is important because they place jets with multiple airlines - a step towards ensuring wider customer acceptance of a planemaker's offerings.\n\nThe A330neo's first operator will be Los Angeles- based Air Lease, whose chief executive Steven Udvar-Hazy had urged Airbus to offer a version of the 20-year-old A330 with upgraded, more-efficient engines. Air Lease also booked an order for 60 of Airbus's single-aisle A321 model.\n\nAerCap Holdings said it would buy 50 A321neos worth US$5.14 billion, the first jet purchase since the world's biggest independent aircraft lessor bought Mr Hazy's former company, International Lease Finance Corp, for US$7.6 billion in May.\n\nThe early results do not fully reflect customer discussions that could yield more sales later in the year, John Wojick, Boeing's chief commercial aircraft salesman, said in an interview.\n\n\"Sales ebb and flow,\" he said.\n\nBoeing's opening-day order book included five sales of its single-aisle 737 Max and six orders for the 787-9 Dreamliner, the newest version of the carbon-fibre plane, to lessor Avolon Holdings Ltd.\n\nThe Bloomberg Industries tally for Boeing and Airbus included orders and options.\n\nAccording to the people familiar with Boeing's order discussions, Air Lease may buy 20 of the planemaker's 737 Max single- aisle jet and six 777 wide-bodies, while BOC Aviation is set to commit to at least 50 of the Max jets. The people asked not to be identified because the details are private.\n\nJet buyers typically negotiate discounted rates, so list-price aircraft valuations don't translate directly into revenue. Planemakers also draw a distinction between firm orders, such as Air Lease's agreement for the A321neos, and commitments, such as the planned purchase of the A330neo.\n\nFor Airbus, keeping all of the firm orders - and confirming the preliminary agreements - will be especially important after a first half marked by 225 cancellations. That compares with 54 for Boeing.\n\nSales of long-haul jets have cooled this year. Boeing announced just nine new wide-body orders in the first half of the year, while Airbus's twin-aisle jet order book shrank by 21 jets.\n\nPlanemakers and customers are absorbing a record backlog of almost 11,500 commercial aircraft orders placed in recent years with a collective retail value of more than US$1 trillion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Industries.- Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/51bf533dd2a27eaebb62fa4de5efd229be72ca082bddea3e52185977d48ce5a5?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Aerial display: An Airbus A350-900, part of the company's new A350 XWB family, during a flight demonstration at the Farnborough air show on Monday. - PHOTO: AFP"}]}

The deal continues a bumper year for Australian mergers and acquisitions (M&As) with transactions totalling US$79 billion in the six months to June 30, compared with US$45 billion in the first half last year, according to JP Morgan. So far in 2014, the country has had 20 deals worth over US$1 billion, compared to just 17 for the entire previous year.\n\nThe sale of the 25 per cent stake in Freeport LNG Development LP also shows the funds management sector's strong appetite for energy infrastructure assets globally. Hastings, owned by Australia's No 2 bank Westpac Banking Corp, sold the stake just as Freeport, which runs a LNG regasification terminal, starts construction on three new liquefaction plants which are expected to begin operations in four years. \"It was timely for Hastings to monetise the investment given strong market demand for assets exposed to the LNG value chain,\" Hastings executive director of global investment Peter Taylor said. \"We are long-term investors but we do not ignore the market and will move to maximise value.\"\n\nHastings has been managing the Freeport stake, bought for about US$200 million in 2010, for Australian funds Utilities Trust of Australia and The Infrastructure Fund, and Zachry American Infrastructure LLC.

Banks that are already struggling to keep up with regulatory costs have to keep an eye on competition from a new breed of lenders that are fleet-footed and have technology on their side, said PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in a report.\n\nIt has also left industry watchers wondering if traditional lenders can eventually pass on the cost from new investments to customers, as profitability erodes. \"Banks today are facing rapid and irreversible changes across technology, customer behaviour and regulation. The net effect is that the industry's current shape and operating models are no longer sustainable into the future.\"\n\nIn particular, the paradigm shifts in technology have become \"a major handicap for incumbents\", PwC said. The physical and software systems that banks have developed - and at a high cost - used to be a solid defence against start-ups. But with customers demanding services such as mobile banking, such rigid infrastructures have turned into liabilities.\n\nPwC and other consultancies have noted that such legacy issues are less problematic in this part of the world, compared to banking systems of much older financial institutions in the West.\n\nStill, the competition is knocking at the door. In China, the large technology players that include Alibaba and Tencent are already challenging the Chinese lenders in tapping the spending power of consumers - a factor oft-cited as the big benefit of urbanisation in emerging Asia.\n\nAlibaba's Alipay wallet allows users to keep their digital cash in their electronic wallet, transfer funds to friends, and more critically for the giant e-commerce player, to shop and pay for products and services. The money in the wallet can also be invested in Alibaba's money-market - which again points to Alibaba's ferocious challenge to the banks.\n\nAlibaba has risen to become China's biggest e-payments firm, the Chinese media reported. One report noted Alibaba, now a strategic investor in SingPost, had won particular favour from Chinese consumers by offering free inter-bank transactions.\n\nIn that vein, banks are eager to learn from e-commerce players, said David Sayer, KPMG's global head of banking. \"Amazon has earned the right to recommend things without being intrusive. I don't think that's product pushing. Banks have got to earn that right.\"\n\nBanks are working extensively at gathering and using data, to innovate in the way they engage customers for payment services, he added. \"Paradoxically, customers feel more in control.\"\n\nPwC also noted \"the exclusive domain\" of collecting deposits is becoming vulnerable, given the growth in money-market funds, peer-to-peer lending, and crowd-funding.\n\nThis is a growing market in the West, with Mr Sayer pointing to start-ups that offer loans to new graduates at rates based on the schools they came from.\n\nRegulation can only protect banks up to a point, said Paul Henaghan, managing director in the Asia-Pacific and Japan at ACI, a payment systems developer, noting that the taxi industry, which is tightly regulated, was disrupted by Uber. In Singapore, DBS and OCBC have upped the ante in offering fund transfers. In OCBC's case, its bank customers can now pay friends that do not hold OCBC accounts quickly, and send a payment notification through Facebook.\n\nFor DBS, it is looking to spur greater usage of the mobile wallet, and has kept transactions \"ring-fenced\" among DBS customers.\n\nSingTel has also edged into this space, tying up with Standard Chartered to develop a mobile wallet.\n\nDBS had noted earlier that while Singapore has a large number of smartphone users, its consumers have shied from mobile payment, citing security as one concern. Banks in Singapore, and Asia, should be able to fulfil that expectation of trust, though PwC noted the financial crisis has undermined the reputation of banks globally.\n\nBut these endeavours are costly for banks that are juggling higher regulatory costs. One way for banks to keep costs down is to share systems such as ATMs, which is the practice in South Africa, said Mr Henaghan.\n\nBut eventually, banks will have to find a way to charge customers for these new-fangled services.\n\n\"Banks need profit more than before.

Our overall goal is to achieve strong consistent returns with below-average volatility. Some people refer to the funds as 'eat well/sleep well' funds: you achieve nice solid returns and, hopefully, there won't be negative surprises.\"\n\nHis team manages the Franklin Mutual Series' longstanding Mutual Beacon Fund, the Franklin Mutual European Fund and the Franklin Mutual Euroland Fund. Roughly US$76 billion is invested in the Mutual Series.\n\nLately, there has been renewed interest in US and European equity funds among bank distributors here, as Asian clients are typically underweight those markets. Volatility has been muted, which has encouraged clients. The Mutual funds' relatively lower volatility is understood to be an added attraction.\n\n\"Correlations have dropped recently and that's a major positive for a bottom-up fundamental manager. That's a steep contrast to some years ago where you saw macro-driven risk on/off trades and markets traded in sync. Now stocks are trading once again on fundamentals . . .\"\n\nMr de Leon adds that a short-term correction would not be a surprise. \"But at the same time, through this five-year bull market, we've had a number of sceptics calling for a decline, which hasn't happened. Our focus is on trying to find great companies with attractive fundamentals versus trying to predict the direction of the market.\"\n\nBoth the Mutual Beacon and Mutual European funds are allowed allocations of up to 20 per cent in distressed debt and merger arbitrage strategies. The typical allocation, however, is smaller. At the moment, the Mutual Beacon, which invests mainly in US equities, has under 5 per cent in those strategies; and the Mutual European fund has around 1.6 per cent. The strategies are expected to enhance returns and lower risk through low correlations with equity markets.\n\nBeing contrarian investors, Mr de Leon's team is typically drawn to stocks associated with some degree of bad news. Its holdings, for instance, include General Motors (GM), which is currently grappling with product recalls and litigation due to a faulty ignition switch. It also owns Microsoft.\n\nMr de Leon says the key is that the potential upside of a stock should far outweigh the potential downside. In GM, for instance, the firm believes that a more stable car market in Europe will be a positive. On the recalls, he says: \"We think the actual monetary damage will easily be handled by GM given the strength of their balance sheet. We see positive developments for them going forward.\"\n\nMicrosoft, he said, \"continues to generate tremendous cash\" and is doing well on the enterprise part of the business. Some 3.3 per cent of Mutual Beacon Fund is invested in Microsoft.\n\nMr de Leon's team focuses on metrics such as cash flow and how effectively companies use cash. \"We like to see managers return cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We look at their acquisition history: Do they have a history of creating value through acquisitions, or do they destroy value by overpaying?\"\n\nHe says independent fundamental analysis helps to discern between deep value and a value trap. One key ingredient, however, must be present: a catalyst to unlock value. This may be in the form of new management, restructuring or a share buyback.\n\nThe Mutual Beacon Fund has underperformed the S&P 500 over three- and five-year periods. Over five years, for instance, it returned 15 per cent compared to the S&P 500's 18.4 per cent on an annualised basis. The firm says the fund's lower beta means it tends to underperform when markets are strong. Cash may also be a drag, as well as allocations into non-US equities which have not fared as well as US stocks.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

If either side is unsatisfied with the board's decision, the claim moves to arbitration in Miami.\n\nA separate claim for about US$888 million for work stoppages is still being discussed between the two sides, while another worth about US$497 million for the quality of aggregate used for the concrete mix is at the dispute adjudication stage, according to the canal officials.\n\nThe first US$180 million claim to reach arbitration, over the cost of draining an area to create work space near the Pacific locks of the 80-km-long canal, was to begin on July 21 with procedural hearings at the International Chamber of Commerce's arbitration court in Miami.\n\n\"Both sides will submit their terms and draft procedural orders for how things will work,\" said Carolyn Lamm, a lawyer with White & Case representing the construction consortium.\n\nLabour and cost disputes have plagued the effort to expand the 100-year-old canal, fanning fears of delays that could cost Panama millions of dollars in lost shipping tolls and posing a setback for companies worldwide that want to move larger ships through the waterway that links US South and East Coast ports to Asian markets.\n\nWork ground to a halt in early February due to the dispute over who would bear cost overruns that boosted the project's US$5.25 billion budget to nearly US$7 billion.\n\nIn a deal signed in March, the Panama Canal Authority and the Grupo Unido por el Canal consortium led by Spain's Sacyr and Italy's Salini Impregilo agreed to inject US$100 million to resume work. Both also agreed to extend repayment of US$784 million of advanced payments made by the Panama Canal Authority to the consortium until 2018 at the latest.\n\nPanama Canal Administrator Jorge Quijano in June said between 75 per cent and 76 per cent of the engineering project was complete, and a third set of locks to allow bigger ships to pass through the waterway should open in January 2016. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM", "images": []}

However, analysts say these restructuring plans could bring mixed fortunes for the group.\n\nOCBC analysts Low Pei Han and Andy Wong wrote that the consolidation of Emas Marine into EOC would lower the group's gearing and allow for greater transparency, which would facilitate financial revaluation of the stock.\n\nLee Yue Jer of OSK-DMG suggested that the Emas Marine sale may also boost growth for Ezra. \"This could lower Ezra's net gearing to 70 per cent from the current 96 per cent, offering more debt headroom for growth,\" he wrote.\n\nFurther, Kevin Chong of Deutsche Bank noted that the secondary listing of EOC would also help in raising its profile.\n\nHowever, several analysts were cautious on the possible listing of the group's subsea business, saying that this would effectively leave Ezra as a holding company with various listed entities.\n\n\"Investors may subsequently question the need to invest in the holding company itself since they can directly invest in the operational units,\" Mr Chong wrote.\n\nMoreover, analysts highlighted that Emas Marine post-sale could lead to an earnings dilution in the near term, even though future growth may be higher, as the new assets will not come online until 2017.\n\nEzra is expected to own 54-60 per cent of EOC after the transaction, depending on the quantum of share issues, but this is in effect a placement of ownership stakes in Ezra's assets, and could lead to an earnings dilution of 6-9 per cent for Ezra owners.\n\nThis is because analysts expect as much as 40-56 per cent of Emas Marine earnings will not flow out through minority interests to EOC shareholders, OSK-DMG's Mr Lee added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

At the same time, companies must maintain at least 25 per cent of shares as a free float to remain listed in Hong Kong.\n\nYesterday, OCBC reminded Wing Hang shareholders and option-holders that its offer closes on July 29 at 4pm, Hong Kong time.\n\nIn a separate filing yesterday, it also said that Wing Hang had become its subsidiary.\n\nIn April this year, OCBC offered to buy all of Wing Hang's shares for HK$125 a share, for a total offer of HK$38.4 billion (S$6.2 billion).\n\nEarlier this month, OCBC's offer for Wing Hang became unconditional after the former managed to gain ownership of more than 50 per cent of the Hong Kong lender's shares.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That is not only because it would be a nice time to visit that lovely Canadian city but also because it will be hosting Interferry's 39th annual conference.\n\nThe global ferry organisation has a knack of homing in on the most relevant issues, and has been working hard for several years to improve the safety of mainly small domestic ferries in developing countries.\n\nIronically, safety issues will take centre stage in Vancouver on Oct 4-8 because of a terrible accident on a relatively large ferry in a technologically and economically advanced country. Interferry has been in dialogue with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for some time about assisting in efforts to improve domestic ferry safety and has been involved in practical projects. These and other cooperative safety initiatives will feature in a wide-ranging conference agenda addressing the industry's major regulatory, commercial and technical challenges.\n\nIMO's latest safety strategies for both vessels on international voyages and domestic ferries will be examined by the conference's special guest speaker, Jeff Lantz, US Coastguard regulations director and chairman of the IMO Council.\n\nAfter reviewing current thinking on international passenger ship safety - notably arising from the Costa Concordia accident - he will outline IMO measures to help countries improve safety on purely domestic ferry services. IMO, of course, has a problem when it comes to ships on internal routes: they are outside its legal remit although it does offer advice and technical assistance.\n\nA panel discussion on the human side of safety includes John Garner, fleet director of UK-based P&O Ferries, who will describe how Maritime Resource Management (MRM) training aims to enhance company safety culture by changing attitudes and behaviours. The UK had to learn the need for MRM the hard way. The 1987 sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise, with the loss of 193 lives, is still engrained in the national psyche in the same way the Sewol will be in South Korea's. But things have changed massively in the way the country's ferries are operated.\n\nIn one of several pre-conference briefings provided by Interferry conference speakers, Mr Garner stresses that MRM is not about technical skills. He explains: \"It is about the use and coordination of all knowledge, experience, expertise and resources available to the crew to achieve established safety and efficiency goals. MRM includes an understanding of the importance of good management and teamwork. Importantly, engineers and shore- based fleet personnel are included on the courses with the captains and deck officers.\"\n\nThe same panel will also include input from Darren Johnston, safety and security director at conference host Vancouver-based BC Ferries. He will outline the company's SailSafe safety culture project, a joint initiative with the BC Ferry Marine Workers' Union. He notes: \"Things don't go right because people behave as they are told, blindly following the rules, but because they are capable of adjusting performance to match the conditions and challenges of the modern operating environment.\"\n\nCommon pathway\n\nFerry companies run their ships in the same waters as short sea cargo shipowners and it makes sense for the two groups to cooperate. So another special guest speaker argues for short sea operators to come together to define, defend and promote the industry. Kirk Jones, government affairs vice-president at Great Lakes and St Lawrence Seaway bulk carrier Canada Steamship Lines, says: \"We need to find a common pathway to ensure our interests are met in a continual and sustainable fashion at IMO. It will also be important to ensure policymakers are cognisant of the value of our movements and the effect that shipping policy has on modal choice.\"\n\nThat could be another way of saying: \"We were caught napping by IMO's implementation of the sulphur limits in the Emission Control Areas.\"\n\nHowever, the ferry sector is now very much alive to environmental issues, and recent Interferry conferences have included technical sessions on how to meet the impending regional and global restrictions of heavy fuel oil. This year, the business case for LNG fuel comes under scrutiny from John Hatley, vice-president, ship power, Wartsila North America. His update will summarise the key drivers of the shift to liquefied natural gas, compare the economic merits of LNG and diesel configurations, and forecast market trends for the new fuel over the next decade. Also, the requirements and options for LNG storage on passenger vessels will be discussed by P\u00e4ivi Haikkola, R&D manager at Finland-based naval architects Deltamarin. Her presentation will include design conclusions drawn from several case studies.\n\nAdding to disappointment at not being able to travel to Vancouver is a note from Interferry saying that the two-day conference is part of a five-day working and social schedule that includes an exhibition supported by event sponsors; a golf tournament; a whale-watching safari; and networking receptions. The programme concludes with a technical cruise on board the Coastal Celebration - one of three of the world's largest double-enders built for BC Ferries by Flensburger of Germany - when the crew will demonstrate emergency preparedness. Delegates and spouses will then have the option of a three-day post-event tour based in Victoria, the British Columbia provincial capital located on neighbouring Vancouver Island. Interferry knows how to run a good conference programme, and to drum up enough delegates to make the whole thing worthwhile.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Barry Callebaut, based in Zurich and the world's largest producer of bulk chocolate, has doubled capacity in Asia since 2009 as Cargill Inc and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co added bean-processing plants.\n\nGrowth in Asian demand has contributed to a rally in cocoa, the key ingredient for chocolate, which climbed to the highest level since August 2011 in New York on July 3. Rising consumption in emerging markets including China and India may spur shortages that extend into the next decade, with the global bean deficit seen reaching 1 million tonnes by 2020, according to Hardman & Co, a London-based research firm.\n\n\"In the longer term, the scarcity of quality cocoa is a serious concern for our entire industry,\" Barry Callebaut chief executive officer Juergen Steinemann said by e-mail in reply to Bloomberg questions.\n\nAsia, home to about 3.7 billion people, or more than half the world's population, will be the consumption \"powerhouse\" for cocoa and chocolate, said Gerard Manley, a managing director at Singapore-based Olam International Ltd, which supplies about 10 per cent of world beans. The shortage will push up prices at least 10 per cent through the end of 2014, he said recently.\n\nFutures climbed 14 per cent this year to US$3,083 a tonne on ICE Futures US in New York on on Monday and reached US$3,149 on July 3, the highest since August 2011.\n\nConsumption of chocolate confectionery in the Asia-Pacific region averaged 200 grammes per person last year, less than the Middle East and Africa, according to Euromonitor. Demand expanded 4.5 per cent, the fastest rate in the world and almost six times the global increase of 0.8 per cent. Australia and New Zealand munched the most chocolate with 4.8 kg per person, followed by Western Europe at 4.6 kg.\n\nBarry Callebaut doubled chocolate output capacity in Asia to 90,000 tonnes in 2014 from five years ago and a further increase is possible, Mikael Neglen, the Asia-Pacific chocolate president, said in a recent interview. The Swede moved to Singapore last year before his company spent US$950 million for the cocoa-ingredients unit of Petra Foods Ltd in the country.\n\nBean processors are adding facilities in growing areas to ensure supply, according to Yeong Chye, ADM's Asia cocoa managing director in Singapore, where capacity has quadrupled since 1984, when the plant opened. Cargill, based in Minneapolis, will start a 70,000-tonne plant in Indonesia in the second half, its first in Asia.\n\nOlam is starting a new facility in Ivory Coast this year and another in Indonesia in 2016, according to the company. Ivory Coast, Ghana and Indonesia are the top cocoa growers.\n\nShares of chocolate makers are advancing. Barry Callebaut climbed 34 per cent in the 12 months through Monday, while Mondelez International Inc, based in Deerfield, Illinois, surged 28 per cent. Mondelez owns Cadbury India Ltd, which holds a 65 per cent market share in a nation with 1.2 billion people.\n\nThe race to process more beans may be premature as demand expands more slowly than expected, said London-based analyst Caroline Bain of Capital Economics. Increasing prices may also deter purchases in emerging markets that are sensitive to higher costs, she said.\n\n\"While we see cocoa consumption growing steadily in Asia, we're more cautious than a lot of forecasters who assume that European-style consumption levels will be reached relatively soon,\" Ms Bain said in an e-mailed reply to questions.\n\nDemand in China, ranked 11th in the world in terms of market value, may take more than 10 years to overtake the US, according to Mohamed Elsarky, chief executive officer of Godiva, the luxury chocolate maker controlled by Turkish billionaire Murat Ulker.\n\nThe 88-year-old Belgian firm has opened more than 50 shops in China since 2009 and seeks to double that in five years, Mr Elsarky said.\n\nThe chocolate confectionery market in the Asia-Pacific region will expand to US$16.3 billion in 2018, a 23 per cent climb from last year, according to Euromonitor.\n\nThe world market, dominated by Western Europe and North America, will increase 13 per cent to about US$124 billion, it says.\n\n\"The Asia market is growing very fast as people are very fond of chocolate,\" said Philippe Daue, a fourth-generation Belgian chef who has spent 18 years in Asia and is Godiva's Beijing-based Pacific Rim chef chocolatier.\n\n\"The availability of cocoa beans to meet the growing demand for chocolate will become all chocolatiers' biggest challenge worldwide,\" he said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Companies & Markets\n\nNvidia to resume H20 AI chip sales to China in US reversal\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nIndonesia looking at levy on coal exports to boost state coffers\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:03 PM\n\nAsia: Markets mixed as China\u2019s economy meets forecasts\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:49 AM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nFCT extends Northpoint City South Wing management by a year\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:28 AM\n\nChina\u2019s quant funds boost US recruiting after Trump\u2019s visa curbs\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nGold holds ground with spotlight on US inflation data\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:51 AM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n2\n\nDollar-selling is becoming a bubble, which may burst, HSBC says\n\n3\n\nStocks to watch: SGX, Frasers Centrepoint Trust, NTT DC Reit, BRC Asia\n\n4\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\n5\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value", "images": []}

One amusing rumour is that LTA hopes to suppress new car demand and hence keep COE prices down.\n\nThe simple reason, though, is that car distributors will presumably try and circumvent the 130 hp rule. So, to thwart this, each new model will be tested on a dynamometer.\n\nThis is a device for measuring power and torque, but many are concerned because they do not know which make and model LTA has chosen. Different dynos have different baselines and will produce varying results. Then there is also a difference between dynamometers for front-wheel-drive, rear-wheel- drive and all-wheel-drive cars.\n\nLTA has, however, given the assurance that a \"correction factor\" will be applied to the power figure measured at the wheels.\n\nBut the experts say that the correction factor varies according to different power trains. There is no internationally recognised correction factor or range of factors. So the question is: will LTA apply more than one correction factor, and how will it be determined for each car?\n\nThe choice of a 130 hp limit to distinguish between a Cat A and Cat B car is already a unique standard, and it is noteworthy for having been adopted by the government agency of a non-vehicle manufacturing country. But to attempt to test each new model to ensure its conformity to this new rule may require a deeper understanding of engine-manufacturing technology.\n\nBecause even though an engine leaves a factory with a certain horsepower specification, the actual output recorded on a dyno will also vary according to the air pressure in the tyres and atmosphere, the type of engine lubrication used and the varying tolerance of each engine component.\n\nThat is why manufacturers usually quote a more conservative power rating to account for these factors. If testing yields different results, bitter arguments may ensue - resulting in even more confusion and further delays in the approval process.\n\nFor some, the COE quota system before February may have been unwieldy for its many rules and changes. But now, it seems the system has veered into a black hole with everyone in the dark about what is happening, except LTA.\n\nThose in the industry who had wanted LTA to apply the open market value (OMV) of a vehicle as a COE benchmark have been repeatedly given the rationale for the power-limit rule. But even if they accept the explanation, something must be wrong if a system becomes unnecessarily complex - or, worse, opaque.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They like that FindNest helps build trust and transparency, and is an added productivity tool,\" the self-proclaimed serial entrepreneur shared.\n\nSaid Tey Ying Hwee, senior sales manager at SLP Realty: \"While FindNest seems like a useful, disruptive technology, it remains a new, untested concept. Today, agents, buyers and sellers use 'last transacted prices' - easily accessible by the public via HDB and Urban Redevelopment Authority's websites - as the closest figures to market valuation.\"\n\nShe noted that prices on both government websites are \"already very transparent and updated\", and cautioned that those on FindNest - coming from the crowd - would be more opinionated.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Damac's US$650 million sukuk has lost investors 1.3 per cent this year through last week, Bloomberg data show. That's the worst of all Islamic bonds from the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, which returned an average 4.1 per cent.\n\n\"Damac's sukuk priced on the expensive side,\" Richard Segal, a London-based international credit strategist at Jefferies International Ltd, said on July 9. \"If sentiment changes in the real-estate industry, investors judge them among the entities most likely to suffer.\"\n\nReal estate prices are either close to or match pre-crisis levels in 2008, Moody's said in a July 8 report. The IMF said this month that Dubai's successful bid to host the World Expo 2020, and its planned US$8 billion spend before the event, could trigger a decline in real estate prices if not implemented prudently. The emirate is considering regulations to limit the sale of properties before they are built, the Fund said.\n\nThe proposed measures from Dubai would be welcomed by the industry and may help assuage investor concerns, Doug Bitcon, a Dubai-based fund manager at Rasmala Investment Bank Ltd, said on July 9.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the volatility it displays is down to its BB credit rating with Standard & Poor's, two levels below investment grade, which means many Islamic institutions aren't able to hold the credit, he said.\n\nDamac's sukuk was more than four times subscribed when it was listed on Nasdaq Dubai, said Niall McLoughlin, the developer's vice-president of corporate communications. \"The current price presents a significant investment opportunity given current interest rates, the predicted growth in Dubai tourism and the investment being made in infrastructure throughout the emirate.\"\n\nDamac is a \"Dubai story\" and fund managers are concerned about the company's ability to manage cash flow in the case of another crisis, Mr Safieddine said, adding that this real estate boom will probably end.- Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

We looked for simple demographic and financial factors that, in logic, would produce a winner. So we rated the World Cup teams according to population, participation, fan base and squad value. Why? We assumed that good soccer teams would come from populous countries with a large base of players. And that it would help if the game had produced big stars basking in the adulation of fans.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/traditional-fashion-retail-going-out-style", "site_title": "Is traditional fashion retail going out of style?", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nIs traditional fashion retail going out of style?\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jul 13, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] In the tragic Greek chorus of retail, the apparel business must surely be wailing the loudest. Some of them have stopped wailing altogether and simply disappeared.\n\nIn 2012, the \"wearing apparel\" category shrank to 2,576 establishments from 2,681 the year before, even as the majority of retail categories grew in number. The apparel segment was in terrible company, shrinking alongside the twilight category of \"books, newspapers and stationery\" retailers.\n\nRising rents and manpower costs have put the squeeze on retailers in general, but those in the business of hawking threads have felt the fallout particularly keenly.\n\nThe labour crunch, for example, has been more than a cost issue; having fewer shopgirls on the floor also stealthily eats away at revenue. Experienced salespeople help to upsell additional accessories or clothing items to a customer who'd originally come in to buy one specific thing. Now, the labour crunch indirectly encourages shoppers to do exactly what retailers dread: stick to buying what they need.\n\nAt the same time, while most retailers are buffeted by a combination of adverse factors, the fashion retail business is exposed to all of them, and to a larger degree.\n\nWhile Singapore used to be a regional tourist destination for fashion labels that were hard to find elsewhere in Southeast Asia, a proliferation of these brands elsewhere has diminished that status somewhat.\n\nLast year, international visitor arrivals hit a record high, growing 7 per cent to 15.6 million. Collectively, they spent 2 per cent more in Singapore compared to 2012 - but they weren't shopping more; tourism receipts for shopping actually fell one per cent.\n\nOn the domestic front, the fashion retail business is also suffering from what insiders call \"leakage\". Locals are postponing shopping sprees for large blowout sessions overseas, at places like Bangkok's Platinum Fashion Mall where dresses can go for $3 apiece.\n\nThe online shopping revolution has hit the apparel business the hardest. Earlier this year, Rakuten's global e-commerce index study found that clothing and accessories are the items most commonly bought online in Singapore, accounting for the purchases of almost 65 per cent of local online shoppers.\n\nElsewhere in the world, this trend is also taking its toll on clothing retailers. In America, Aeropostale and Abercrombie & Fitch each announced 50 or more store closings this year. Another clothing retailer, Express, will close 50 stores over the next three years.\n\nInternet retailers are not just taking a bite out of brick-and-mortar sales; they are swallowing chunks of their traditional counterparts too. In March, Alibaba took a 35 per cent stake in Intime Retail, the largest department store operator in China's Zhejiang province, for US$692 million.\n\nRetailers here that are not fortunate enough to be on the receiving end of Jack Ma's largesse will find going it alone online difficult, especially if they use the franchise model.\n\nSome fashion retailers here signed franchise agreements with foreign fashion labels at a time when physical and online retail were viewed as two separate animals. Now, while local franchise-holders might have the rights to the foreign brand on the physical front, the online channels for the Singapore market are handled by the foreign label's headquarters.\n\nBecause of this, local shoppers are able to buy the same items online - parallel-importing these clothes, as it were. For now, the impact on a brick-and-mortar franchise-holder is relatively muted as it tends to have price-parity agreements with the principals that handle the online offerings.\n\nEven so, fashion retailers here without labels to call their own risk the ground shifting beneath them. Inditex, the Spanish firm behind labels like Zara and Massimo Dutti, has started placing more of its chips on online channels.\n\nIt has online stockrooms in Russia, the UK, Poland and the United States. A \"standard\" delivery for them will soon take just one day.\n\nLast month, Inditex said it would launch Zara on Alibaba's Tmall, China's fastest-growing online marketplace. What happens on the mainland might seem remote, but it should worry fashion retailers here.\n\nAnswering analysts' questions about the Tmall tie-up last month, Inditex's CEO Pablo Isla simply said: \"It is like opening a store in a shopping mall.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Those are all measures that will make it easier for policyholders to get quality care.\n\nBut simply improving the policy's effects for holders, especially the less well-off segment of the population, goes only partly towards addressing the reason why those residents might need help in the first place. Without more aggressive steps to address cost and supply, there is a risk that policymakers may be healing only the symptoms and not the disease.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

While the strategists have a mixed record of being right, history shows the bull market has already lasted longer than average and individuals tend to pile in at the end of the rally.\n\n\"If Wall Street, after poring over all known data, comes up with a target and we're already there, and you still see individual investors buying and they're typically the ones that are late to the party, it would seem there is limited upside,\" Terry Morris, a senior equity manager at National Penn Investors Trust, said recently.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Wealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom: survey\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

We are creating many job opportunities in our economy, but we need a better, more systematic way to match job seekers to vacancies.\"\n\nSince WDA launched the beta version of the Jobs Bank in May, more than 4,300 employers and 12,900 job seekers have registered to use the platform. Singaporeans may use their SingPass to create an account on the Jobs Bank.\n\nWDA said that the website complements other existing job-search platforms, and not compete with them. WDA added that it is currently in consultation with private job portals and will be discussing possible collaboration arrangements in the coming months.\n\nWith the launch of the website yesterday at the Lifelong Learning Institute in Paya Lebar, WDA also organised a Jobs Bank career fair. More than 1,500 job opportunities were offered at the fair by 15 major employers from different industries.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Consignments from Mercedes-Benz cars to Adidas AG sporting apparel and Siemens AG power-plant technology drove the sale of German goods and services abroad to 1.09 trillion euros last year, about two billion euros shy of the record in 2012, according to data supplied by the Federal Statistics Office.\n\nAdidas, as the official sponsor of Germany and its contender Argentina, had a headstart going into Sunday's duel as \"the most visible brand\" in the final, chief executive officer Herbert Hainer said.\n\nThe bout ended 1-0 in Germany's favour, crowning Joachim Loew's eight-year reign as the national coach. Substitute Mario Goetze scored in the 113th minute, allowing the Germans to avoid a penalty shootout.\n\n\"Psychologically it has a positive effect on self- confidence,\" said Mr Boellhoff. \"While you can't calculate this in detail, it can have a positive influence on work motivation and confidence in producing quality.\"\n\nWorld Cup victories have coincided with periods of economic prosperity in Germany in the past. The 1954 defeat of Hungary in Bern marked the start of the country's post-war political and economic recovery, boosting the morale of a defeated nation. The 1974 winner's medal came at the dawn of another economic resurgence, and the year before, Germany became one of the founding nations of the Group of Six industrialised countries, which was subsequently extended to include Canada and Russia. The 1990 final in Rome, also against Argentina, came eight months after the Berlin Wall came down. \"It's true that in the three years after 1990, the German economy grew very strongly, but the reason was reunification,\" said Mr Boellhoff, referring to the merger of East and West Germany on Oct 3, 1990. \"We have to differentiate between causality and correlation.\"\n\nSunday's victory marks the first for a united Germany. No country has made it to more World Cup finals - eight - although Brazil holds the record for titles, with five to Germany's four.\n\nRegardless of the sporting success, the German economy is heading towards a period of renewed economic prosperity with the beckoning of the \"golden 2020s\", Mr Boellhoff said, citing a new report on Germany published by Prognos last week.\n\n\"Germany is the only country of the largest economies in Europe that is in a really strong situation right now,\" he said. \"This can improve even more when its neighbours gradually emerge from the crisis, and this will happen in the next few years.\"\n\nGerman economic growth accelerated more than forecast in the first quarter, propelled by domestic demand and a construction boom. The Bundesbank, in June, raised its growth forecast for the economy, predicting gross domestic product will increase by 1.9 per cent this year, higher than the 1.7 per cent it predicted in May. It expects GDP to climb by 2 per cent in 2015.- Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n2\n\nDollar-selling is becoming a bubble, which may burst, HSBC says\n\n3\n\nStocks to watch: SGX, Frasers Centrepoint Trust, NTT DC Reit, BRC Asia\n\n4\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\n5\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value", "images": []}

EDB had earlier announced that \"although this is a one-off event, the decline will be registered in the year-on-year growth for the rest of the year\".\n\nThe missing information, economists say, will help them better gauge where Singapore's manufacturing sector - and therefore the broader economy - is headed.\n\nSaid DBS economist Irvin Seah: \"Why all the hush-hush when it has had such a big impact? We don't need to know which company was affected, but we need to know the reason behind this so-called permanent change in semiconductor output. It has a huge impact on overall manufacturing growth and GDP, so more transparency in that regard is certainly required.\"\n\nAdded CIMB's Song Seng Wun: \"If nothing else, a bit more meat in terms of where the drop (came from) would help - at the moment we're all a bit blank.\"\n\nWhile most economists have interpreted the drop in semicon output to mean that a large firm had relocated out of Singapore, others think it's possible that a company could simply be upgrading its machinery - a more sanguine explanation for this year's downtime.\n\nBut no matter their theory, economists agree that the lack of clarity is hampering their ability to forecast overall economic growth.\n\nSaid UOB's Francis Tan: \"EDB has already told us that the effects will be felt until the end of this year, but without knowing whether this was due to a plant shutdown or a machinery upgrade, (our private-sector forecasts) will have a higher standard deviation.\n\n\"It really depends on which hypothesis the economist picks - if it's a plant shutdown, there'll be no upside; if it's a machinery upgrade, the growth rate should come back next year. (Our forecasts) will be more haywire, but there's no choice because we're not told what (caused the decline). There are still a lot of question marks.\"\n\nAt the same time, economists acknowledged that EDB could have contractual obligations preventing it from explaining the semicon output drop.\n\nSo far, EDB has continued to decline to share the name of the company, the specific reasons for the output fall, and the nature of the company's operations, citing company confidentiality reasons.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Embraer has been seeking to expand its manufacturing operations in China, a key market for the world's third-largest commercial planemaker.\n\nBut plans to refit its regional jet plant in Harbin to make the larger E-Jets were not approved by Chinese authorities as China is investing in a competitor in that size of aircraft. Instead, Embraer is making the Legacy 650 business jet in Harbin, though the outlook for Chinese business jet sales has dimmed recently with a general chilling of conspicuous consumption in China.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n2\n\nDollar-selling is becoming a bubble, which may burst, HSBC says\n\n3\n\nStocks to watch: SGX, Frasers Centrepoint Trust, NTT DC Reit, BRC Asia\n\n4\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\n5\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value", "images": []}

This resulted in SGX issuing a \"trade with caution\" advice for the stock.\n\nThe exchange query was a first for UOB in recent memory. A check showed that it was the first time SGX had queried the bank since 2009, said UOB spokeswoman Tan Ping Ping.\n\nUOB ended the day 3.58 per cent or 83 cents higher at $24.03, and is up 13.4 per cent year to date. Over 4.35 million shares changed hands yesterday, more than double the daily six-month average of 2.17 million.\n\nThe Straits Times Index is up 3.99 per cent for the year.\n\nDBS Group Holdings also did well yesterday. It rose 1.18 per cent to end at $17.17 and is up 0.41 per cent for the year. OCBC Bank closed unchanged at $9.40 and is down 7.84 per cent for the year as investors worry about a cash call from the bank to fund its US$5 billion bid for Hong Kong's Wing Hang Bank.\n\nOne analyst said banking counters are doing well overall (except for OCBC), and there are unlikely to be any new reasons for UOB's sharp rise.\n\nUOB's outperformance has been attributed to its focus on Asean and its lower China exposure, as well as its strong capital ratio. China's slowing growth and growing shadow banking fears are frequently listed as concerns though many observers have said they do not expect a hard landing from the world's largest trading nation.\n\nUOB is well capitalised and its margins will benefit from a sooner than expected rise in short-term rates in Q1 2015, said Macquarie Research earlier this month.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

What would be the main factors behind your decision?\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jul 13, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nAnnie Yap\n\nManaging Director\n\nAYP Associates Pte Ltd\n\nPossible new sites for the setting-up of a new factory would be the new emerging markets - for instance, countries such as Myanmar, Vietnam and Cambodia. In these countries, the growth and expansion opportunities that are available make it attractive to set up the next factory there. Cost of labour is neither the main factor nor the most important that should be considered. More important considerations include the ease of doing business, supporting infrastructure and the availability of technology in the country. Political stability is also a key element that an international manufacturer has to consider as political/social unrest can easily disrupt day-to-day business operations. Quality is more important than merely low business costs - otherwise it could become just a war on costs, with manufacturers ending up looking only for cheaper and cheaper alternatives, which would not be sustainable.\n\nKaren Reddington\n\nRegional Vice-President, South Pacific\n\nFedEx Express\n\nThe potential that we're seeing in emerging markets - such as the MINT (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria, Turkey) and CIVETS (Columbia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey, South Africa) countries - is tremendous. However, the decision to locate business and manufacturing facilities would depend on a variety of factors, including a domestic market with strong growth potential, availability of talent and labour, stability, attractiveness for foreign direct investment, and pro-trade, pro-business policies.\n\nSpecifically, the success of global commerce in these new markets will require the intersection of the right physical and informational infrastructure to be in place. This includes the development of ''hard'' infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, ports, airports, power and Internet access; as well as ''soft'' infrastructure, such as the liberalisation of trade policy and an advanced educational environment. The right investments will bring bright futures for these economies and enhance the role they play in the global marketplace.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPLAN-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\nI WOULD still site the next factory in China, which will evolve to be a super economic power. It makes strategic sense to be present in the largest domestic market. That said, the operation would not be a ''sweat shop''. It will pursue more value-add activities, which will take advantage of the creativity, innovativeness and talent in China, as it acquires more experience and builds its track record in the journey to become a super economic power.\n\nI expect China to evolve from a labour-intensive manufacturing centre to a knowledge-intensive one, much like what the United States and Singapore had gone through in the past. China will be a major global manufacturer of a wide range of products and a global provider of multifarious services. When that happens, China does not need to be a factory to the world; we can expect the country to expand its manufacturing footprint to capitalise on the comparative advantages offered by other less-developed countries, such as South and South-east Asia, Africa and South America, to complement its domestic operations.\n\nMany Chinese companies will become global and multinational. When this happens, there will be enormous opportunities to be tapped. It makes good business sense, therefore, to operate right in the backyard of China, if I have the next dollar to invest.\n\nRobin C Lee\n\nGroup COO\n\nBok Seng Group\n\nJUST a few decades ago, the United States and Europe were the main manufacturers producing for themselves and the world. Then, in stormed Japan to take over that role, but not for long. The Taiwanese and the Koreans then had their turn and more countries followed suit.\n\nThe country currently in the spotlight, China, will eventually lose its accolade as the world's factory with its labour costs rising and its people aspiring for better things in life, including higher wages. China is no longer just producing for others but is also itself a huge consumer, with the potential to rival the US and Europe soon.\n\nNow factories are springing up in Vietnam, Cambodia, Bangladesh and Indonesia, if they have not already done so, as these countries have plenty of labour to produce the goods the developed world needs. But these markets may not be the final destinations. There is no doubt that these manufacturing sites will eventually make way for newer and greener locales.\n\nIn my view, what is imperative is not just the cost and availability of labour but the long-term productivity and effectiveness that a country can offer to remain competitive in terms of stability, quality and price. A well-planned and well-designed plant with optimal use of efficient processes and labour-saving automation will triumph in the long run.\n\nA low-cost country will remain low-cost only until inflation, social pressure and growth set in; then its costs will soar just like in China. Ironically, it will not be long before we start seeing more manufacturing returning to the developed countries where everything is produced using minimal or no human labour.\n\nDr Jim Li Hui Hong\n\nCEO/Founder\n\nJSB Tech Pte Ltd\n\nRECENT years of global financial crises have unveiled the vulnerability of an overly services-driven economy, while manufacturing is now recognised as an important pillar to both the developing and advanced economies in forging sustainable development and growth. In particular, high-valued manufacturing is gradually re-shoring back to some advanced economies as part of efforts to halt declining job losses resulting from their decades of aggressive overseas outsourcing.\n\nChina, as the world's factory, took a leading role to increase wages for the past five years, effectively ending the ''cheap goods'' era and moving towards ''affordable goods''. This is likely to benefit the lower-middle income South-east Asian countries and perhaps India too.\n\nAs Singapore is a maturing and increasingly diversified economy having a relatively small manufacturing base, it would be highly strategic to retain a critical cluster of some key manufacturing sectors in order to ensure supply chain competitiveness and responsiveness, which are key requirements for a vibrant innovation-driven economy.\n\nTim Moylan\n\nPresident, Asia Pacific\n\nInfor\n\nTRADITIONAL factors that contribute to the choice of manufacturing sites today continue to be overheads, wages, taxes and the availability of skilled labour. As Asian economies transform and the global manufacturing model transitions from ''made-in-Asia'' to ''consumed-in-Asia'', manufacturers are looking for locations that provide both cost value - in terms of traditional factors - and centralised access to emerging Asian markets such as Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand.\n\nThat said, enterprises in today's global economy also need to evaluate their connectivity and IT infrastructure to enable them to manage and utilise offshore manufacturing sites more efficiently. These technology considerations are crucial, regardless of the actual physical location of a plant. New developments in enterprise software and the development of cloud-based systems provide manufacturers with flexibility as advances in IT infrastructure alleviate other business costs such as logistics and communication between the upstream and downstream supply chain.\n\nManufacturers will do well to consider their ability to navigate and access manufacturing data and resource allocation tools in real time, together with traditional considerations such as taxes and labour costs.\n\nNg Tian Beng\n\nVice-president and Managing Director\n\nDell South Asia\n\nBOTH government and market forces play a key role in determining manufacturing competitiveness of countries and subsequently an organisation's manufacturing strategy. According to Deloitte's 2013 Global Manufacturing Competitiveness Index, access to talented workers is the top indicator of a country's competitiveness, followed by a country's trade, financial and tax system, and then the cost of labour and materials. Dell is seeing ample opportunities in emerging markets globally from both a manufacturing perspective and also market growth. While China remains an important market for us, with several production factories, and design, R&D and solution centres, we have also invested in production facilities in countries across several regions. In Asia, Dell already has production facilities in Malaysia, India and China, and we continually assess any market's feasibility and potential as a production hub for the organisation to efficiently deliver our end-to-end solutions to customers.\n\nNatalie Shuman\n\nSenior Vice-President, General Manager, EMEA & APAC\n\nKelly Services\n\nPOLITICAL stability, robust infrastructure, costs and favourable regulations are factors that most businesses, including manufacturers, will consider before setting up international operations. However, another major consideration is the availability of talent. Business productivity and performance is often closely linked to the skill level of the labour force, and this is one of the reasons why manufacturers still look to China.\n\nAlthough labour may be cheaper elsewhere, the large and increasingly skilled workforce in China means companies can enjoy higher productivity as well as the flexibility to manufacture a variety of products. Although labour costs are increasing, they can often be offset by the reliability and sophistication of the Chinese supply chains, which are seldom available in emerging markets.\n\nCompetitor countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar have been quick to try and play ''catch up'' with China and if they continue to develop their talent, supply chains, business infrastructure and government regulations, they may well begin to offer a serious alternative to international manufacturers looking for new sites.\n\nYeoh Oon Jin\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nPwC Singapore\n\nAS cost competitiveness in China's big cities erode, many companies have moved their manufacturing facilities further afield to second-tier or third-tier cities where infrastructure is not as advanced. Consequently, they face logistical and other challenges. As a result, many MNCs are looking for alternatives and Asean presents a great opportunity.\n\nWith the progress made by the Asean Economic Community to provide a One Market and One Production Base, companies can leverage on the low-wage economies within Asean to establish their manufacturing base and use Singapore as an administrative and distribution HQ for the region.\n\nIn addition, Singapore's relative ease of entry and doing business (ranked top city state by the World Bank and IFC in ''Ease of Doing Business'';\n\nhttp://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings\n\n), large talent pool, ready infrastructure, coupled with an extensive network of favourable tax treaties and free trade agreements further strengthen the case for MNCs to use Singapore as a hub to serve the region.\n\nLaletha Nithiyanandan\n\nManaging Director\n\nTalent Design Potential\n\nDECIDING where to locate a manufacturing business is dependent on the type of products manufactured. If the products are more sophisticated requiring higher investments and skill levels and infrastructure, the manufacturer is better off locating his facility in a country that offers more transparency, security and skilled talent.\n\nOutsourcing manufacturing to lower-cost countries from a business point of view is purely opportunistic and short-term focused. In the longer term, it can erode innovation and increase competition because of poor enforcement of intellectual property laws in some of these countries. In many cases, quality has also suffered because of a lack of skilled workers.\n\nAll these factors lead to increased costs over time, which is the challenge China is currently facing. However, the government's educational reforms, financial support and substantial supply of raw materials, coupled with its competitive physical infrastructure, position China still as a promising manufacturing hub.\n\nJoshua Yim\n\nCEO\n\nAchieve Group\n\nBESIDES the ease of getting workers cheaply, the other key deciding factor on where to site a factory for me is the stability of the country's government. Investors usually look for political stability and that is why Singapore has always attracted a lot of foreign direct investment into the country.\n\nTake Thailand as another example. While labour is not that cheap, it is still lower compared with most developed countries. However, Thailand's prolonged political turmoil is very disruptive and crippling to businesses operating there and results in a loss of confidence by investors. Thus, even if business costs are generally low in a particular country, there may be other prices to pay due to political instability.\n\nBeing in the business of recruitment and human resources, my other concern would naturally be whether the country's infrastructure in terms of its labour policies are supportive of the management team running the operations on the ground. Is it easy to secure workers and deploy them as factory managers there, for instance? If the hiring laws are such that I would encounter a lot of difficulty in securing the right workers, this would pose a problem and thus should be an important consideration too.\n\nMark Newman\n\nCEO\n\nING Commercial Banking Asia\n\nINDONESIA'S manufacturing sector is set to receive a windfall from slower growth in China. The commodity boom caused by rapid China growth in the years before the global financial crisis turned Indonesia into a commodity exporter; the economy de-industrialised. The process reverses with slower growth in China, and Indonesia is likely to experience a ''manufacturing renaissance''.\n\nFurthermore, Indonesia's large and growing population - both in numbers and per capita income - will create significant opportunities for exports and domestic consumption.\n\nThat said, the Chinese economy will continue to lead the growth in Asia in the near future. As the Chinese economy transits, we are now seeing interest from Chinese corporates to expand beyond the region into Europe, especially in sectors such as industrials, energy, consumer, real estate and TMT (Telecommunications, Media & Technology), where Europe is more advanced and offers a lot of value to the Chinese corporates.\n\nScott Robertson\n\nVice-President, Asia Pacific\n\nWatchGuard Technologies, Inc\n\nMANUFACTURING is commonly known as a highly process-driven and employee-centric industry with constant demand for the highest levels of productivity. Hence, in order to ensure productivity, companies not only need to look at labour and operational costs, they will also need to focus on IT security and connectivity.\n\nAs organisations branch out internationally and tap virtual networks, they need to understand the importance of IT security and its impact on productivity. Issues such as denial of service disruptions (DDoS), malicious viruses and database breaches may result in the leakage of essential trade secrets or customer data. Security breaches can also shut down a company's ability to comply with regulatory requirements, leading to network and production downtime.\n\nAnother issue which may affect the daily workflow includes having an adequate network infrastructure in place to ensure that crucial data flow is secure and uninterrupted among branch offices.\n\nWhat this means is that it is critical for manufacturers to consider IT security and infrastructure, in addition to labour and operation costs, as key factors when selecting a host country. The combination of a robust backend IT solutions and a strong employee force at the forefront enhances productivity which will be translated into savings in labour and operations costs for organisations.\n\nRosalynn Tay\n\nCEO\n\nDentsu Singapore\n\nMAKING the right decisions about the location of manufacturing facilities is vital in order to compete in global markets. Those who make the best choices can gain a major source of competitive advantage. There are a myriad of considerations that go into the manufacturing equation; these typically involve factors such as facilities, labour availability, trade zones, governmental regulations and the local community in that region or country.\n\nAt the end of the day, the decision will have a direct impact on the quality of your product and your company's reputation. When choosing a manufacturer, you'll need to consider the nature of your company and how well the supply chain supports its business model. There's no one-size-fits-all rule. You need to be flexible and nimble.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The value of any potential deal is unclear.\n\nA Qantas spokesman declined comment on the matter, saying it was \"speculation\". Jetstar Asia and Lion Air also declined to comment. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore had no immediate comment.\n\nAny potential sale would help the bottom line of Qantas, which saw stiff competition at home and overseas pushing it deep into the red in the six months ended Dec 31.\n\nIn February, Qantas said it had shed staff, slashed spending and sold gas-guzzling planes as part of its most radical shake-up since it was privatised 20 years ago. It has also halted the expansion of Jetstar, all steps aimed at convincing the Australian government that it is worthy of the state assistance it says it desperately needs.\n\nLion Air, Indonesia's largest privately run carrier, is one of the world's fastest growing airline groups, with more than 500 aircraft on order.\n\nChief executive Rusdi Kirana told Reuters earlier this year he aimed to have 1,000 planes operating by 2030 and that he was toying with the idea of building his own airport that would have a private road and a complex for diplomatic staff and families, as well as a concert hall.\n\nJetstar Asia, whose majority shareholder is an investment vehicle controlled by Singapore travel agency tycoon Dennis Choo, is the biggest unit of Jetstar, flying to more than 20 destinations including the South-east Asian tourist hotspots of Bali, Phuket and Hanoi. It operates 19 aircraft.\n\nAccording to a Qantas statement, Jetstar Asia flew two million passengers in the six months ending December 2013, up 14.5 per cent from the year-ago period. Load factors eased to 78.8 per cent from 78.1 per cent.\n\nQantas did not give a detailed breakdown of the financials of Jetstar's affiliates, but overall, the Jetstar group swung to an underlying operating loss in the six months ending December 2013, with Qantas saying competitive pressures, especially in South-east Asia, were among the factors behind the weak results. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nNvidia to resume H20 AI chip sales to China in US reversal\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nIndonesia looking at levy on coal exports to boost state coffers\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:03 PM\n\nAsia: Markets mixed as China\u2019s economy meets forecasts\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:49 AM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nFCT extends Northpoint City South Wing management by a year\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:28 AM\n\nChina\u2019s quant funds boost US recruiting after Trump\u2019s visa curbs\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nGold holds ground with spotlight on US inflation data\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:51 AM", "images": []}

Firms in the precision engineering and food manufacturing sectors provide examples where productivity has increased by more than a quarter in just four years, noted the minister, even as he acknowledged that overall productivity figures are still weak.\n\n\"One reason is construction, which has been a laggard,\" said Mr Tharman. \"But, for the non-construction sectors, they are no longer at zero per cent . . . There are a lot of stories on the micro level, so you just have to wait for them to filter through the system as a whole.\"\n\nOne of the SMEs visited, Chan Kian Metal Works, designs and fabricates hydraulic manifolds with integrated circuits used in offshore/marine equipment and construction machinery. Upon moving into the facility in January this year, the company installed a goods handling system within their three-storey factory which has enabled them to integrate their production line vertically through the movement of raw materials and final products between floors.\n\nThis, says the company, has allowed it to enjoy immediate improvement in land productivity by three times. The unit also provides the company with sufficient space to take on higher value-added activities such as the sub-assembly of hydraulics systems. The result is an increase in production space of about 300 per cent which outpaced rental increase of 40 per cent. The other SME, Delta optics, manufactures lens moulds.\n\nJTC Space @ Tanjong Kling is developed by JTC Corporation and comprises 18 units of three-storey factories. The project incorporates structural provisions to allow companies the flexibility of installing their preferred material handling systems to move goods and machinery between floors. As operations can now be integrated over multiple floors, companies enjoy lower land rentals without sacrificing their gross floor area, optimising industrial land usage.\n\nOn average, industrialists located there have been able to lower their land rental costs by about 30 per cent, reduce set-up cost, and improve land productivity, thereby enhancing their competitiveness in the process, said JTC. Certain industries are growing their productivity rates faster than others and likewise, within industries, certain firms are moving faster. It is simply a matter of time before the firms that are upgrading gain market share and begin to exert pressure on their peers, said Mr Tharman.\n\n\"Then, you find that the whole industry starts moving to a different beat,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The $51 million facility can process about 200,000 tonnes of scrap metal a year, with only 20 new hires, or 12 per cent more staff.\n\nThe doubling of production capacity is mainly due to continuous shredding and separation processes employed in the new plant, located on Shipyard Crescent. Scrap metal was previously processed into smaller pieces by compression and shearing machines , which operate on a batch basis. Now, continuous shredders that handle about 100 tonnes of scrap metal per hour are used.\n\nProcessing is now continuous, with metals being fed into the machines on a conveyor belt. \"It's a slight difference but that's where the productivity gains are,\" said Lim Teck Siang, Kim Hock's general manager.

The question is: How long can the US consumer keep spending if prices are rising faster than wages? Something has to give, economists say. Either the prices of petrol and food must stop rising, or the average wages of Americans must start rising. Otherwise, consumers will spend less, and US companies will make less.\n\nThis week, a wholesale inflation index, congressional testimony from Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen and second-quarter earnings reports from a broad range of companies could help solve this important market riddle.\n\nThere have already been some promising signs for the bulls, who argue that consumers won't have to hold on much longer before a strengthening jobs market translates into wage growth.\n\nThere was a modest 2 per cent rise in average wages reported by the Labour Department for June - keeping up with inflation. Alcoa posted surprisingly strong operating earnings and bank Wells Fargo reported robust profit growth - though its interest margin, a key measure of loan profitability, was short of investor targets.\n\n\"Wells Fargo has become an important bellwether, given its footprint throughout the country and its product line,\"said Quincy Krosby, investment strategist at Prudential Financial. \"They talked about commercial lending picking up, which is very helpful because it indicates (demand) is growing.\"\n\nWells Fargo's peers such as Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase will chime in with their reports this week. These banks have more to lose than Wells from the slowdown in trading activity and volatility in stock and bond markets.\n\nDespite financial shocks such as the latest scare from Portugal and major armed conflicts, the broad Standard & Poor's 500 has not registered a daily move of more than one per cent in more than seven weeks, noted Ryan Detrick, an independent technical analyst.\n\n\"This is the longest streak in nearly 20 years and the reality is this super low volatility world we've been in isn't going anywhere soon,\" Mr Detrick said.\n\nSome contrarians would say that subsiding volatility is usually the calm that comes before the storm. The quiet markets could also be a tonic for investors in the short term, however. Many investors, such as seasickness sufferers, are still traumatised by the last storm - the extreme volatility of the 2009 financial crisis. Stockmarket watchers say that there has not yet been a \"stock craze\" among retail investors as usually happens during a bull market, and the calm waters may encourage more Americans to tiptoe back into the market.\n\nThe bears will study Ms Yellen's commentary and the earnings reports this week for signs that consumer spending will dry up before wages increase.\n\nThere are signs that poorer consumers are already feeling the pinch from rising petrol prices. Indeed, inflation may have been a factor in the paltry spring retail sales that stores and economists alike had attributed entirely to the weather. That's certainly a theory put forward by Family Dollar chief executive Howard Levine on a conference call, according to reports on Dow Jones Newswires.\n\nMr Levine reportedly said that poorer consumers were squeezed between government cutbacks, higher fuel prices and continuing struggles to find work.\n\nFrom another retail niche, Lumber Liquidators, which sells flooring and other hardware, cut its earnings projection because of waning demand. Tractor Supply, which sells machinery to farmers and ranchers, also saw a slowdown.\n\nWith most of the US bathing in summer sunshine, stores can no longer blame the weather.\n\nOn aggregate, second-quarter earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are expected to grow 6.1 per cent from a year earlier, according to data from Thomson Reuters.\n\nOther major reports next week include those from industrial conglomerate General Electric, which has a hand in almost every industry and every major economy; healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson, which has become a favourite of \"value\" investors, who care more about steady return customers and dividend payments than rapid growth.\n\nThese corporations, too, could struggle to meet targets if sales growth does not outstrip the rising prices of energy and raw materials.\n\nGoogle, which also reports earnings, may not worry about these costs, but the search and advertising giant depends on growth in consumer spending.\n\nTechnically, the stock market still looks like it's in a strong upward trend. The broad S&P 500 has held close to record highs, despite the bad news, and any positive surprises from earnings reports could be enough to push it back over those records.\n\n\"It seems like we've had a terrible week, but if you put it in perspective, considering the market's still within spitting distance of (records), it's incredible,\" said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade.\n\nAny weakness in earnings - or a resurgence of inflation or European banking worries - could mean another down week, however.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But for at least one optimistic property investment firm, this creates a \"compelling opportunity\" to enter the market.\n\nForum Partners, which manages US$6 billion in assets, plans to invest in China through its offshore private equity (PE) fund and is banking on a surge in developer demand for funding, Gregory Wells, head of Asia, told BT in a recent interview.\n\nForum Partners is currently investing in its third real estate fund in Asia, and although sector-agnostic, it sees the most opportunities in residential properties, particularly in first-tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. It raises funds from mostly US and European institutional investors, targeting returns close to 20 per cent.\n\n\"Right now, the cooling measures are creating constraints in liquidity, which gives us opportunities. We think the downturn on the macro level is cyclical, not structural, and it will pick back up again in the next 6-18 months. We don't think the property market is going to implode and give us liquidity issues, and now is a good time to invest.\"\n\nThe firm, he said, still believes in long-term Chinese growth - clearly not as robust as years before but still better than in much of the rest of the world. Going by private equity activity in the region, other such players in Hong Kong and China seem to think likewise, he added.\n\nForum Partner plans to invest another US$100 million in Chinese developers in the next 6-9 months, on top of its current portfolio of Chinese assets of around US$125-150 million.\n\nThis is despite the recent collapse of Ningbo developer Zhejiang Xingrun Real Estate in March, which fuelled speculation that other Chinese real estate companies could follow suit.\n\nIn April, Nanjing-based Sainty Marine Corp said that an entrusted loan (or inter-company loan) it made with a local property developer had gone bad. The latter failed to repay 90 million yuan (S$18.1 million) plus a dizzyingly high interest of about 18 per cent that Sainty was charging.\n\nThese are signs of a ticking time bomb in China's burgeoning shadow banking system, where alternative financiers (mostly trust companies) offer high-interest loans to businesses which are unable to borrow from banks.\n\nYet, Mr Wells is indifferent to the development of shadow banking in China - which he believes is \"a natural progression that financial markets develop to disintermediate away from banks, so that not all flows of credit have to involve banks\".\n\nHe noted that China's financial system is heavily weighted towards banks as the only financial intermediary. Typically, besides trust banks, shadow banking also includes other respectable lenders such as insurance companies and private wealth management firms.\n\nCiting data from BCA Research, he said China's shadow banking segment - which represents about 30 per cent of the financial system - is in fact \"underdeveloped\" compared to the US - where the segment is 100 per cent, or equivalent, to the banking system. Insurance companies are also a huge shadow lender in real estate in the US.\n\n\"This isn't happening in China yet, but you will see over time more of that disintermediation away from banks in China occur,\" he feels.\n\nWhat then warrants the market's concerns over shadow banking in China?\n\nIt is the astonishing growth of credit from the shadow banking system, coupled with the country's not-so-robust regulatory environment, which leads to the worry of a major blow-up in the loans made, Mr Wells said.\n\n\"But we don't think that will happen. If you look at real estate loans and the way trust companies are making loans, generally speaking, they are heavily over-collateralised.\n\n\"We expect more defaults to occur in industrial and natural resources. But even if you consider the likely worst-case scenario, the number of defaults and amount of losses shouldn't be significant enough to disrupt the financial system,\" he said.\n\nAsked if he isn't worried about developers defaulting, he replied: \"It's certainly something to be cognisant of. What we've seen is a couple of relatively small local developers who have had defaults, and there is usually not a good story behind them; maybe they were focused on a single city and became overextended.\"\n\nZhejiang Xingrun, for instance, is a small unlisted developer with projects mostly in Fenghua city in Zhejiang, a province which has experienced massive building in recent years.\n\n\"Some trust banks have undoubtedly made some loans to borrowers that will go bad just given the overall expansion in credit in the last few years,\" Mr Wells said.\n\n\"But most of the sponsors we work with tend to be larger regional players, have a broader sales base, and are not particularly focused (in one city or province). We would stay away from developers that are overextended irrespective of how much they are willing to pay for the money.\"\n\nIn the case of Singapore, the current property cooling measures and loan curbs could arguably create similar opportunities for the company, but Mr Wells said the company is not looking to actively invest here because the large local property firms that dominate the market have strong balance sheets and plenty of sources of capital.\n\n\"They can go to the local banks, which are cheaper sources of capital than ours. They don't need us,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The offer closes on July 18 and trading is expected to begin on July 22.\n\nThe company chose to list in Singapore as it believes investors here will be receptive to the South Korean entertainment market. SEGL is primarily involved in producing films - script-sourcing, filming and editing. These are paid for by film investors. Film investors share profits with the production company, but have to bear all the losses. A production company suffers no loss if a film is unprofitable.\n\nSEGL owns two prominent production companies, Zip Cinema and Opus Pictures. They have been involved in films such as Cold Eyes and Snowpiercer. These titles were among the top 10 grossing films in South Korea in 2013, according to Box Office Mojo, a website which tracks box office revenue.\n\nSEGL also invests in films, and typically holds stakes of 15 to 30 per cent in the films it produces. This increases earnings from successful productions, but comes with the risk of losses for underperforming films.\n\nA key risk in the film industry is the volatile revenues. It is difficult to predict the popularity of a film. Production work mitigates some of this risk and is thus crucial to SEGL's business model.\n\nThe firm reported 2013 revenue of US$11.9 million, up from US$4.4 million in 2012. It reported net profit of US$2.7 million, from a US$0.3 million loss in 2012.\n\nCharles Spackman, executive chairman of SEGL, believes the company can continue to thrive. Actors are willing to accept lower rates in exchange for the opportunity to work with famed producers Eugene Lee and Tae Hun Lee at Zip Cinema and Opus Pictures respectively, he said.\n\nThe reliance on these two producers is another risk the company cited in its offer document. Mr Spackman, however, believes they are personally invested in the companies, making any departure unlikely.\n\nOut of the expected net proceeds of about $10.84 million, $5.5 million is earmarked for investment in films by Spackman or third-party producers, and the remaining for expansion, establishment of overseas offices, and working capital.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Of late, theirs has been a tale of woe, with rentals high and manpower scarce. Online players are nipping at their heels, local shoppers are increasingly price-conscious and foreign ones are kept at bay by the strong Singapore dollar.\n\nEven so, life (and the show) must go on, and some retailers are regrouping or making do in the face of untenable conditions.\n\nClothing retailer FJ Benjamin, for example, now has a 15 per cent vacancy rate for employees across its network of stores in Singapore. To combat this, the firm moves staff from underperforming stores to those that are doing well, says Ian Lim, CEO of FJ Benjamin (Singapore). The underperforming stores are then downsized or earmarked for closure.\n\nAt the same time, the company has already begun to reduce the size of two or three of its stores where it believes the rental rates are fair but the stores are too large. Elsewhere, some leases up for renewal have had their rental rates negotiated down to \"acceptable\" levels, Mr Lim says.\n\nSometimes, however, push comes to shove, when store sizes or rentals cannot be made smaller or lower.\n\n\"We are looking at closing two or three stores in Singapore . . . to arrive at an optimal network size for the current sluggish market conditions,\" says Mr Lim.\n\nFJ Benjamin is not alone. Across the island, retailers are shuttering stores.\n\nChallenger Technologies, for example, will close its 112 Katong retail outlet when the lease expires this December.\n\n\"From time to time, we review our retail operations and will cease retail operations or not renew leases at locations that are not performing up to our expectations,\" its spokeswoman tells BT.\n\nOver 2012 and 2013, jewellery retailer Aspial opened 12 new stores, but closed 19. The consolidation seems to have worked. Even with a smaller network of stores, its jewellery business revenue rose 4.1 per cent in 2013 to $169.6 million. Profit grew 29.6 per cent on better same- store sales, lower rental expense and depreciation.\n\nWith the labour crunch expected to worsen, some retailers have also pumped money into raising productivity.\n\nSupermarket chain Sheng Siong, for example, invested in a warehouse management system that sped up the process of product picking. It also linked up its seafood purchasing at the Jurong Fishery Port to its back office, distribution centre and supermarkets, feeding all parties in the network real-time information.\n\nThese moves saw Sheng Siong making productivity gains of about 30 per cent, it says. A JPMorgan report in April noted that the supermarket chain had managed to lower its number of employees per store from 67 in 2011 to 58 in 2013.\n\nWhere you can't beat 'em, of course, you join 'em. Both Challenger and Sheng Siong are among the latest brick-and-mortar players to go online, setting up shopping portals on the Internet late last year.\n\n\"Despite a lack of publicity, Challenger's online sales have been growing month-on-month. In fact, it doubled from May to June 2014,\" its spokeswoman tells BT.\n\nSheng Siong's e-commerce foray also means that all the brick-and-mortar supermarket chains in Singapore are now online. They will go up against pure-play online grocers RedMart and a new upmarket contender, GoFresh, for a groceries market that is estimated to be worth $6 billion here.\n\nSheng Siong says it is too early to reveal volumes for its online shopping pilot project which started last November, but it knows that this form of shopping is here to stay.\n\n\"E-commerce will be a way of life in the future, and we are making full use of this as a mutual learning experience; to win over customers who prefer physical shopping and to adapt our model to accommodate their needs,\" it says.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A copy of the document was obtained by Reuters.\n\nIn the document, Vice-Adm Dunaway said that he was committed to returning the F-35 fleet to flight as soon as possible, but there was still \"no discernible event that represents a root cause\". The memo emerged after a lengthy meeting on Friday of the officials responsible for determining the \"airworthiness\" of the F-35, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\nIn the incident on June 23 at a Florida air base, the Pratt & Whitney engine on an Air Force F-35 A-model jet broke apart, pushing through the top of the airplane and catching fire while a pilot was preparing to take off.\n\nMarine Lieutenant General Jon Davis, deputy commandant for aviation, told Reuters late on Friday that the jets might not appear at the Farnborough air show, which begins this week. But he did not see the engine issue as a long-term setback. \"I think we're being very, very conservative in our approach to this, which is the right thing to do,\" he said. \"This is a fantastic programme and we don't want to do anything to screw it up . . . No one wants to do anything that isn't prudent.\"\n\nUntil the grounding is lifted, the US Marine Corps and Britain will not be able to ferry the F-35B aircraft to Britain for the jet's planned international debut at two air shows there this month - the Royal International Air Tattoo, the world's largest military air show that began on Friday, and the Farnborough air show, which starts today and runs until Sunday.\n\nIt would be a embarrassment to the United States if the jets miss both shows and could weaken the plane's export prospects just as two initial partners in the programme - Canada and Denmark - are weighing fresh orders.\n\nThe engine issue also prevented the F-35 from appearing at the July 4 naming of Britain's new aircraft carrier.\n\nVice-Adm Dunaway said that the Navy and other services are continuing to investigate the incident, and planned to update the flight directive no later than Wednesday - two days after the start of the Farnborough air show outside London.- Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM", "images": []}

That's why they need to set up a heterogeneous defence in an age of increasingly diverse threats targeting different corporate setups, which can include large machines on the backend down to mobile phones.\n\n\"There was a six-fold increase in mobile threats last year over the year before,\" he said, noting that companies are facing this challenge as they try to embrace the BYOD (Bring Your Own Devices) trend and allow staff to use their devices on the corporate network.\n\nUsing the mobile as an example of how much companies need to do to stay safe, he pointed out that securing that endpoint goes beyond installing software on the mobile itself.\n\n\"Mobile devices can be an entry vector into the whole company. Apps can root the device and get access to corporate mail,\" he said.\n\nThat's why companies need to secure their mail system and Intranet network accessible through the device, as well as harden any cloud services that will come in contact with the mobile. \"There's a range of things to do beyond 'basic' mobile device safety . . . Half of (mobile) experiences are driven by the cloud. We've been doing a lot more on cloud-based security,\" he said.\n\nThe next big challenge on the horizon for security firms such as Symantec is advanced persistent threats (APTs), said Mr Witten.\n\nThese attacks are far more sophisticated, and go through various phrases in order to infiltrate typical company defences.\n\nAPTs begin with attackers scanning targets and gaining information on weak points and people. This can be done through social engineering methods such as \"spear phishing\", which gets basic user credentials to get into the system by fooling a user to give it up. Other times, malware living on USB drives get plugged into a corporate device, quickly entering the company network.\n\nOnce it breaks in, the attacker lies low in order to avoid detection and maps out further weak points within for a bigger intrusion in the future. The \"seed\" that was in the system is also capable of installing more powerful malware to weaken existing systems.\n\n\"As a result, the (security) industry has moved from a simple model - block or allow, like what firewalls do - to a complex multiphase process,\" he said.\n\nSecurity firms now look for more nuanced signs and patterns in company networks that might reveal the existence of a Trojan Horse lying low within. Companies should look at any subtle changes in activity on their networks each week, which could point to subtle malware, he said.\n\n\"Some grey area things don't convict themselves of being malicious in isolation. But if you see two or three of them that look alike, that's how you might uncover something hiding on your network that could have snuck,\" he said.\n\nThe alarming thing about APTs is the ability for them to stay undetected for a long time. \"Last year, the longest time an APT went undetected was 243 days,\" he said, adding that his goal is to get these numbers down to days or shorter.\n\nTargeted attacks continue to rise, according to vendors. Over last year, Symantec itself found a 91 per cent increase in attacks that were customised for the target, and Russian security firm Kaspersky Lab found that 12 per cent of businesses had at least one such incident happen to them in the year.\n\nNaturally, governments are the prime targets of these APTs. Around 18 per cent of public agencies globally were the victims of targeted attacks last year, and the rate has been increasing over the years, said Mr Kaspersky.\n\nLate last week, the US Department of Homeland Security confirmed that it had been attacked by Chinese hackers in March this year. The attackers appeared to be targeting tens of thousands of employees who could have access to top-secret documents.\n\nLast year, hackers successfully made off with staff and contractors' data stored with the US Department of Energy.\n\nMr Witten said that the advent of APTs means companies need to overhaul their security processes and put these under the microscope. \"You need to look at the day-to-day residual risks for suspicious things . . . (Companies) still need to do homework on data loss prevention, and not just (secure) their endpoints.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/bukit-merahs-slow-steady-gentrification", "site_title": "Bukit Merah's slow but steady gentrification", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nBukit Merah's slow but steady gentrification\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jul 11, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTRENDY cafes may have come and gone in the Bukit Merah neighbourhood, but that doesn't faze new entrants such as Pan Delights and Butterscotch.\n\nButterscotch's Noorazman Abdul Manap, 31, believes he is creating something to serve the community - an all-halal cafe. Being the only halal-certified cafe in the area (and one of the few in Singapore), Butterscotch has gained a steady following. Jerome Siew, the 29-year-old co-owner of Pan Delights, doesn't think it's the area that is presenting a problem: \"The previous owner of my unit was also operating an F&B place, but it served very generic Western cuisine, such as fish and chips,\" he explains, \"so in his opinion, the place had no potential, and his business failed.\"\n\nMr Noorazman also admits that other tenants or older residents are sometimes a bit sceptical of his business. \"We were told (by current tenants and older people in the area) that we shouldn't get this space as the crowd here is 'dead,\" he explains, \"I guess they were afraid of competition.\"\n\nDespite this, he feels the area has much to offer. \"There's accessibility,\" he points out. \"There are schools, offices, and residential areas nearby, furthermore there aren't any cafes, not even a Starbucks or Coffee Bean.\"\n\n\"My take is that a good cafe, wherever it is situated, would make people travel all the way just to explore it, try the food and experience the ambience.\" he adds, \"I don't see why a cafe needs to sit in a 'fashionable' area. Bukit Merah is nostalgic and has its charms, away from bustling crowds.\"\n\nMr Siew agrees that there is hidden potential, in terms of the population shift in the area. \"It's time for the yuppies to move in after the enblocs,\" he says. Accessibility isn't the only plus point. \"A more reasonable rent is one of the reasons we picked the area,\" says Mr Siew. \"Property prices in Singapore have increased significantly over the years, and rent and manpower are the top killers for the F&B trade.\"\n\nHe adds that Bukit Merah won them over after surveying its \"lunch crowd potential\", and the saturation of regular hotspots such as Tiong Bahru. His customers include executives who \"wouldn't mind the occasional $12-$18 treat away from their regular hawker food.\"\n\nSite-specific challenges\n\n\"Many cafes and bistos have made their mark from unfashionable places, and have enticed people to travel there,\" he adds. Still, setting up shop in Bukit Merah, like everywhere else, has its own set of challenges. \"Being a new cafe, we really didn't know what the response would be,\" says Mr Noorazman, \"Especially since we are in a place which people might not frequent during the weekends. Another challenge I think is differentiating ourselves, making sure we are good enough for diners to come over to try our food and then come back for more.\"\n\nPrice sensitivity is another issue, considering the fact that both cafes are situated near hawker centres. \"We - together with Bakery Chef and Butterscotch - have become the dominant price leaders in the area,\" says Mr Siew. The area is also predominantly surrounded by three-room flats and is occupied by mostly older residents or locals with low spending power, meaning that most of their customers have to travel to the area to patronise the cafes.\n\nAlthough Mr Siew and Mr Azman insist that the new cafes popping up at the same time is just a coincidence, this might point to a sign that the rate of gentrification in this area might just be getting a sudden boost.\n\nAfter all, why travel all the way to town or some obscure venue for a meal, when you can just head across the street for an upscale cafe with reasonable prices? Mr Siew agrees, pointing out, \"If a place manages to survive increasing rental and food prices long enough, while updating their products till they draw in a crowd, others will follow suit, and the place will eventually be 'hip'.\"\n\nChoosing a neighbourhood area may not just be a brave move for entrepreneurs after all - it may be a smart one as well.\n\nButterScotch\n\n164 Bukit Merah Central #01-3625\n\nTel 6271-1164\n\nHours: 10am-10pm (Tue-Sun)\n\nNoorazman Manap originally started this 22-seater cafe as a project he could run after retirement, but then he got another lightbulb moment. Sensing the scarcity of contemporary eateries that serves halal dishes in Singapore, he then decided to fashion it as one of the few halal-certified cafes where Muslims could relax and dine as well. The six-month-old cafe is christened after his five-year-old web design agency, ButterScotch Creations, and takes over a 600 sq ft unit once occupied by another cafe. Mr Noorazman fell in love with the nostalgic and charming neighbourhood while hunting for units last year and quickly swooped in to transform it into a rustic, cosy space lined with brick walls and wood furniture. The cafe mainly specialises in sweet treats that contain its namesake ingredient, such as the Butterscotch Souffle, which comes with a scoop of butterscotch ice cream and chocolate sauce, and the Snickers Cheesecake Sandwich. Or tuck into a selection of Western and local fusion creations such as the Ramly Meets Wendy Burger. Prices range from $6.50 to $14.\n\nPan Delights\n\n161 Bukit Merah Central #01-3725\n\nBukit Merah Estate Tel 6223-7321\n\nHours: 12pm-2.30pm; 5.30pm-9.30pm (Tue-Fri); 11am-3.30pm; 5.30pm-9pm (Sat); 11am-3.30pm (Sun)\n\nThe casual yet upscale hangout is run by business partners Jerome Siew, 29, and Andrew Pan, 29, who have known each other for 11 years. Mr Siew is an entrepreneur, while Mr Pan has been in the F&B industry for about 11 years, with several of them spent working in Australia. They started Pan Delight with the goal of introducing customers to gourmet casual dining at a neighbourhood-friendly price.\n\nTheir 850 sq ft unit, which replaced another Western eatery, has been turned into a hip address - an air-conditioned, glass-fronted cafe with tasteful all-white tableware and furniture. Every single aspect - from the decor to its menu - was carefully planned and curated by both owners with their customers (young families and office crowd) in mind. The 22-seater cafe dishes out casual Western cuisine such as duck confit ($16.90), cheesy onion chicken ($14.90), beef stew ($16.90) and pan-seared salmon (15.90). They also serve up easy-drinking pours such as MAC's great white ($12 per pint) or bottled beers such as Black Mac ($10 for 330ml) and Magners Pear or Berry Cider ($11 for 330ml).\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There is going to be a heck of a spectacle at the Maracana this Sunday and everyone is invited!\n\nEven with hosts Brazil embarrassingly dumped out of the tournament, the World Cup final will still provide an electric atmosphere and a grand end to the globe's greatest sporting event. Hopefully, the on-field performances will provide as much reason to cheer and mirror, not sour, the atmosphere.\n\nGermany and Argentina could not have made their way to the final in a more contrasting fashion - Germany cruising through via the greatest ever World Cup semi-final thrashing and Argentina stumbling in through penalties in quite possibly the most boring World Cup semi-final ever played.\n\nBut that one fixture alone is insufficient to judge the fortunes of both teams come this weekend. Germany and Argentina both have deep World Cup history and have crossed swords in the final before. The Germans lost 3-2 to a Diego Maradona-inspired Argentina in 1986 but courtesy of a penalty, won 1-0 four year later in a rather uninspired final. So, the 2014 final could really swing either way.\n\nOn paper, Germany has the edge. Their morale is high after a historic semi-final win in Belo Horizonte in which it broke several team and individual records. Physically, too, they are in a more advantageous position, having played their last match a day earlier than Argentina. While Argentina needed a full 120 minutes and a penalty-shootout to book their place in the final, Germany arguably wrapped up their match in the first half, so German legs will definitely be fresher going into their encounter.\n\nOn the pitch though, it could be much tighter. Unlike his predecessors, Argentinian manager Alejandro Sabella favours defensive discipline over attacking freedom - which is a shame considering the range of attacking talent at his disposal. He demonstrated this inclination against Holland when he started the defensive Luca Biglia in midfield to replace the injured Angel Di Maria, effectively killing the supply-line to the forwards. If he sticks with this game plan, Argentina will play with a tightly packed defensive midfield in a bid to stifle Germany's free-flowing game where the outstanding Javier Mascherano will be key to their tactics.\n\nNeutrals (and, of course, German fans) hoping for another high-scoring performance by the Germans had better taper their expectations. Unlike the Brazilian defence, which did not turn up for their match against Germany, the Argentinian defence is much tighter. In the six matches they have played in the World Cup so far, Argentina has only conceded three goals, with two of those coming in the match against Nigeria. That is an impressive average of half a goal per game. An even more remarkable feat is that they have had four clean-sheets out of the six games they played in Brazil, as they have not conceded a single goal in the three knock-out round matches. You just cannot help but draw the comparisons with champions Spain when they won in the last tournament.\n\nBut the Argentinian defence arguably faces their sternest test of the World Cup yet. If Argentina have one of the best defensive records of the tournament, then Germany's attack is one of the most prolific. After 17 goals in six games, the Germans are averaging nearly three goals per game and the ability of their forwards to break down the stubborn Argentinian defence will be key to their team's chances.\n\nIf Germany can get an early goal, that may force the Argentinians to abandon their defensive shape and be more adventurous in search of an equaliser. That would suit Germany's fast attackers just fine as they try to catch the Argentinians in quick breaks.\n\nI hesitate to speculate on a high-scoring game and logically would go for a 1-0 German win. But, I would like to see more goals and hope that attack triumphs in this game of the best attack versus the best defence so my heart hopes for a 3-1 German win. It is the World Cup final after all, and I am allowed to dream!\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But when Jason becomes one of the most powerful men in Greece, he betrays Medea by leaving her to marry the daughter of King Creon.\n\nMedea takes revenge in the most spectacular fashion: First, she paints poison on the robe that the new bride is going to wear. When the bride crumbles from the poison, King Creon rushes to hold his dying daughter, only to be poisoned to death, too.\n\nMedea then proceeds to carry out the most heinous crime a mother can commit - kill her and Jason's children so that Jason would live in regret and sorrow for the rest of his life.\n\nAny production of the 2,600- year-old story of Medea thus pivots on the performance of the lead actress. Fortunately, director Kim Hyuntak has found a sorceress in Kim Mi Ok - an actress so vivid, versatile and volcanic, it's a wonder she isn't more famous.\n\nIn Theatre Group Seongbukdong Beedolkee's hip and hyperkinetic update, Medea is not just a scorned woman. She is a bona fide celebrity in a fur coat and dark glasses, hounded by the paparazzi. She is a guest on a Jerry Springer- style talkshow, throwing punches at her ex-husband and his new wife. She is a gun-toting sharpshooter from a John Woo movie battling three assassins who are after her.\n\nThis is a Medea for the age of information overload, where violence and vulgarity permeate many forms of mainstream entertainment, from TV cartoons to confessional talkshows to video games. Medea on Media, as this production is titled, cannily narrows the gap between the classical and the contemporary worlds.\n\nThe scenarios change constantly. One moment you're in a voice recording studio where Medea speaks in the cartoon voice of Astroboy threatening his enemies, the next you're in a videogame and Medea is a sword-wielding digital character. The chorus in this Greek tragedy changes with her.\n\nBut while these updates give the play striking immediacy, they also undermine the plot and characterisations of Medea, Jason, King Creon and others. The actors are constantly swapping roles and the tone of the play changes at the drop of a hat, so audiences unfamiliar with the story may struggle to make sense of what's going on.\n\nThe one chilling thing that cuts through is its message on media violence: If Medea is a woman who forfeits her humanity to satisfy her desire for vengeance, do we come close to forfeiting our humanity when we crave for violent screen entertainment?\n\nMedea in Media was shown as part of O.P.E.N, the pre-festival event to prepare the audience for the Singapore International Festival of Art in August and September. O.P.E.N. continues this weekend with Ways Of Wandering, a free mass performance at Tiong Bahru Park at 7pm tonight and at MacRitchie Reservoir at 8am tomorrow.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Ezra will receive US$150 million in cash and US$370 million in the form of about 280.1 million new EOC shares, based on the issue price of 8.18 Norwegian kroner per new share.\n\nCompletion of the transaction will raise Ezra's stake in EOC from about 45.7 per cent to approximately 84.6 per cent.\n\nThe enlarged EOC group will be one of the largest offshore support operators in the Asia-Pacific by asset value. It will manage an offshore services platform comprising over US$1 billion in offshore support assets, with a fleet of 50 vessels.\n\nSpeaking to The Business Times, Ezra's group chief executive and managing director Lionel Lee explained that there was a need to separate some of the business divisions of the group as a lot of its existing shareholders identified better with its traditional marine business, which EMAS Marine provided, and understood less the more profitable subsea division, EMAS AMC, which has become the group's main revenue generator. EMAS AMC makes up 80 per cent of its business.\n\nMr Lee said that with the subsea business growing, it had diluted its offshore support services division within the group.\n\nInstead, the consolidation will now provide EMAS Marine with its own balance sheet and allow it to capture the growth in the offshore support services market, particularly with growing demand from Brazil and Africa.\n\n\"The next area that we want the enlarged EOC to capture is the offshore accommodation market,\" Mr Lee told BT. He pointed out that with over US$128 billion of new capital expenditure planned for the offshore segment, there will be greater demand for high-end accommodation vessels, which will be a source of long-term revenue for EOC.\n\nThe consolidation is thus strategic, as EOC will be able to leverage on EMAS Marine's experience in vessel operation and asset management. EMAS Marine will also be able to tap EOC's accommodation vessel growth aspirations, allowing EMAS Marine to grow a new asset class and achieve economies of scale.\n\nThus, with the higher valuation of EMAS Marine now, Mr Lee said the consolidation will provide greater value to Ezra's shareholders.\n\nWith a highly experienced and committed independent management team helming the enlarged EOC Group, Ezra's management will be able to focus on developing the fast-growing subsea services business.\n\nThe enlarged EOC will seek a secondary listing on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) once the transaction is completed.\n\nFurther, Ezra may undertake a secondary sale of shares of up to US$20 million in the Norwegian market directed at EOC's existing shareholders in the Norwegian Central Securities Depository (VPS), at the same price as the proposed offering.\n\nThe proposed secondary listing will allow EOC to leverage the EMAS branding in Asia for greater access to competitive sources of debt and equity. It is expected to improve the overall trading liquidity in EOC shares.\n\nMr Lee said: \"EOC's current listing in Norway appeals to American and European investors. But to appeal to Asian investors, we need to list here and to build the company's identity in the Asian markets since they already have an identity in the European markets.\"\n\nEzra confirmed that the EOC initial public offering here, expected to raise about US$150 million, should be completed before the end of the fourth quarter this year.\n\nEzra shares closed trading yesterday at $1.18, down one cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

His earlier promises that the budget would be bold and would avoid \"mindless populism\" had raised hopes and sent the benchmark BSE stock index to a record high. The expectation was for spectacular change and policy reforms in almost every aspect of the economy.\n\nLet's take a step back and set aside the fact that Budget 2014 is not very different from the last budget or the one before that. In my view, the essence of the budget lies in what the finance minister said at the start of his speech: \"The steps that I will announce in this Budget are only the beginning of a journey towards sustained growth of 7-8 per cent or above within the next three to four years, along with macroeconomic stabilisation that includes lower levels of inflation, lesser fiscal deficit and a manageable current account deficit.\"\n\nOverall, the budget seems to have delivered in line with market expectations. Clearly, the finance minister has stayed prudent and attempted to strike a fine balance between aspiration and the bitter pill of reality. During his budget speech, he said: \"Fiscal prudence to me is of paramount importance because of considerations of inter-generational equity.\"\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/paradigm-shift-use-statins", "site_title": "Paradigm shift in use of statins", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nParadigm shift in use of statins\n\nA strategy that takes a patient-centric approach to managing cholesterol has been recommended by the American Heart Association\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jul 11, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nCHOLESTEROL measurements are routinely done for those going for a general health check-up or an assessment of their risk of heart attack and stroke. Most people believe that the \"bad\" cholesterol (also termed low density lipoprotein cholesterol or LDL-C) will clog their arteries and the \"good\" cholesterol (also known as high density lipoprotein cholesterol or HDL-C) will protect them against heart disease.\n\nFor years, cholesterol guidelines have advised physicians to commence treatment of cholesterol with drugs once the \"bad\" LDL-C exceeds certain recommended targets. Physicians will also commonly tell their patients to embark on measures to elevate the \"good\" HDL-C in the belief that higher HDL-C protects the individual against heart disease. Recent guidelines and trials will change longstanding paradigms.\n\nTreating risk and not numbers\n\nWhat do the new guidelines say about who needs and who does not need cholesterol lowering medication (statin)? The latest cholesterol guidelines issued by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology in November 2013 have attracted a storm of controversy for its paradigm shift.\n\nWhile the new guidelines are not based on new trial data, it has taken a whole new approach to managing cholesterol. Instead of using LDL-C numbers generated from a blood test as the basis for decision-making, the new strategy takes a patient-centric approach by recommending the commencement of statins if an individual falls within one of four defined risk groups. The new guidelines define those who have heart artery disease, stroke or narrowing of the lower limb arteries as having atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).\n\nThe four groups who are at risk of a stroke or heart attack are:\n\nSimply put, those with known arterial disease, severely elevated LDL-C, are middle-aged/elderly diabetics or those middle-aged/elderly with increased risk of ASCVD should be considered for statin consumption. It also means that if you are young and have no risk factors or known ASCVD, you do not need statin if the LDL-C is less than 190 mg/dl.\n\nIf you don't fall into the four defined risk groups but still have elevated LDL-C and are still uncertain about whether you should start on statins, here is another checklist that the newest guidelines provide. You need to discuss the necessity of taking statin with your physician if you have any one of the following:\n\nHow low should 'bad' cholesterol go?\n\nThere is general consensus and an overwhelming scientific data to illustrate that lowering LDL-C is beneficial in preventing heart attack and stroke.\n\nUnlike the existing guidelines which recommend achieving a target level of LDL-C < 100 mg/dl for those with known heart artery disease and multiple risk factors for heart disease, the new guideline takes the stand that while groups that are at risk of ASCVD should aim to lower the LDL-C levels, it does not recommend any specific LDL-C or HDL-C targets.\n\nAlthough the new guideline does not make reference to any specific LDL-C target to achieve, it does however recommend that if the LDL-C < 40 mg/dl on two consecutive visits, the dose of the statin can be reduced.\n\nThis approach has stirred a storm of controversy and other experts have referred to previous cholesterol-lowering trials that have validated the target of LDL-C < 100 mg/dl. The most interesting thing about the issue of setting an LDL-C target is that the new recommendation of not fixing targets is not based on new data but is based on the same data which lets the earlier experts who were writing the existing guidelines to recommend the target of LDL-C < 100 mg/dl. Hence, physicians are most likely to continue to use the recommendations of achieving a target LDL-C < 100 mg/dl for those with known heart artery disease.\n\nRisk calculator\n\nA new global risk assessment calculator was proposed about the time the new cholesterol guidelines were released to estimate the likelihood of getting a stroke or heart attack in 10 years or a lifetime.\n\nCritics have commented that when the new risk calculator is applied to existing ongoing trial populations, it significantly overestimates risk. The data is based on an American population and is not meant to be applied to Asian populations.\n\nFurthermore, one needs to understand the meaning of being at risk. When using a global risk assessment calculator and the risk score predicts that the person has a 20 per cent risk of a heart attack over the next 10 years, does it really mean that the person has a one in five chances of getting a heart attack within the next 10 years if he does not modify his lifestyle?\n\nAccording to the 2013 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association Guideline on Assessment of Cardiovascular Risk, no one has 10 per cent or 20 per cent risk of a heart attack during a 10-year period.\n\nWhat a 20 per cent risk within a 10-year period means is that within a group of individuals with the same risk profile, for every 100 individuals, there will be 20 individuals who will develop a heart attack within the 10-year period.\n\nOnly those who are predestined to have a heart attack will be able to take steps to prevent the heart attack event. There is no evidence to support the use of risk calculators for guiding drug treatment. The new guideline clearly states that risk calculation should be more appropriately used to motivate therapeutic lifestyle change in younger individuals.\n\nThe right approach to cholesterol\n\nDo not be alarmed when risk calculators estimate that your risk of heart attack or stroke is 20 per cent. What it means is that 80 out of 100 will not be at high risk. Using additional tests, doctors can sieve out the 20 out of 100 high-risk individuals who need treatment.\n\nIf you fall within the four risk groups defined in the new guideline, you will benefit from statin therapy. In principle, lowering the LDL-C is beneficial and if the LDL-C falls below 40 mg/dl on consecutive tests, the statin dose should be reduced. There are studies to validate the reduction of LDL-C to 100 mg/dl to reduce strokes and heart attacks for those with ASCVD and hence, it is reasonable to use this as a target despite the absence of fixed targets in the new guideline.\n\nAs statins do have potential side effects, including increasing the risk of diabetes in those who are predisposed, the general principle is to use the highest dose of statin to achieve the lowest LDL-C possible without any adverse effects.\n\nThis series is brought to you by Heart, Stroke and Cancer Centre.

The distribution will be paid to unitholders on Aug 14.\n\nNet property income for the quarter came in 2.7 per cent higher than forecast at $37.7 million, on the back of lower operating expenses. \"Continued savings in utilities attributed to higher efficiency in usage and more competitive utility rates,\" the Reit said.\n\nIt added: \"Net property income of Paragon and The Clementi Mall exceeded forecast by 2.6 per cent and 1.3 per cent respectively, due to proactive management of expenses.\"\n\nThese are the only two assets in the Reit's portfolio, although a third, Seletar Mall, is slated for completion by year end.\n\nGross revenue was in line with its forecast at $50.4 million. The total amount distributable to unitholders was 3.6 per cent higher than forecast at $33.9 million.\n\nBoth Paragon and The Clementi Mall were fully leased. The renewal of all the leases expiring FY14 have also been completed ahead of time, the Reit said.\n\nYear-to-date (from July 24, 2013 to May 31, 2014), it has declared a DPU of 4.6 cents, on the back of net property income of $127.9 million - both of which exceeded forecast.\n\nOver this period, Paragon also enjoyed rental uplift of 11.5 per cent, while The Clementi Mall's average rental rates achieved for its 121 expiring leases was 5 per cent higher than the average rates of the preceding leases typically contracted three years ago.\n\nSPH Reit has no refinancing requirement till 2016; its weighted average term to maturity is 4.3 years. Its gearing level stands at a healthy 26.9 per cent, with an average cost of debt of 2.33 per cent. Over half of its $850-million debt facility is on a fixed rate basis.\n\nSusan Leng, CEO of the Reit manager, attributed the positive performance to \"the strong positioning of both properties in our portfolio, proactive asset management and firm partnership with our tenants\". The Reit, however, flagged the continuing manpower crunch as a factor likely to take a toll on retailers' expansion plans.\n\nRetail sales (excluding cars) fell year-on-year in March and April, with the latter month registering a steep 16.3 per cent drop in sales of watches and jewellery. Economists suspect this might have to do with weakness in visitor arrivals this year.\n\nLast week, CIMB initiated coverage on SPH Reit with a \"buy\" rating at a target price of $1.06, citing its unique combination of prime Orchard Road and stable suburban retail, as well as its exposure to Singapore's rising medical tourism. Besides a mall, Paragon also comprises a medical suite and office property.\n\nUnits of the Reit added half a cent to finish at $1.03 yesterday before its Q3 earnings were announced.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/very-different-lexus", "site_title": "A very different Lexus", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nA very different Lexus\n\nThe Lexus NX200t gets a turbocharged engine and revolutionary styling. By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jul 11, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nDO goldfish have more than a three-second memory? Has the Lexus brand really embraced turbocharging? The surprising answer to both is, yes. Apparently, fish aren't as forgetful as we think they are, and the Japanese luxury marque which pioneered petrol-electric hybrid technology has unveiled its first turbocharged engine.\n\nThe 2.0-litre four-cylinder unit with forced induction is for the Lexus NX, the company's first compact SUV. Called the NX200t, this model slots in below the NX300h with a 2.5-litre petrol-electric hybrid. Both are all-wheel-drive but while the NX300h has the familiar continuously variable transmission (CVT), the NX200t gets a new six-speed automatic gearbox. Lexus says the turbocharged option not only allows for smaller engines, but also cater to buyers who want something more aggressive than a quiet hybrid.\n\nWhatever the reason, anyone considering the NX will probably be attracted first by its revolutionary styling. The sculpted \"3D\" surfaces and boxy wheel arches make it the edgiest Lexus design ever.\n\nUnderneath, the NX uses the same basic platform as the Toyota RAV4 (Lexus is the luxury division of Toyota). But engineers stress that 90 per cent of it is new, with the body structure benefiting from additional welding, laser screws and body adhesive (like the Lexus IS) to increase rigidity. The bonnet is made of aluminium not only for lighter weight but also to reduce pedestrian injury. The suspension incorporates MacPherson struts in front and rear double wishbones. The latter is the best choice for stability and comfort, says the assistant chief engineer, and thoroughly suited for a luxury compact crossover like the NX.\n\nHe isn't wrong. On the road, the NX200t displays a high degree of ride comfort. If the optional Adaptive Variable Suspension is chosen, the damping varies with the driving mode chosen, be it Normal, Sport or Sport+.\n\nIn Sport+, the steering and engine response are also tweaked but the NX200t still feels more refined than sporty. The twin scroll turbo was developed in-house (Toyota had extensive experience with turbocharging when it was involved in rallying a decade ago) and there is virtually zero lag - only smooth, seamless torque. But it is no WRC monster.\n\nIn fact, the unit stands out for being super efficient because it can switch between the Atkinson and Otto cycles automatically. The Atkinson cycle allows it to be more economical at low loads and engine speeds, while the standard Otto cycle provides good performance at higher loads and engine speeds.\n\nThe 1,800 kg kerb weight blunts the NX200t's performance somewhat. But the all-wheel-drive system's tendency to distribute 100 per cent of the torque to the front axle, and directing up to 50 per cent to the rear wheels only when needed, means handling is reassuringly stable while fuel economy is maximised. At 4.63 metres long and 1.63 metres tall with a 2,660 mm wheelbase, the cabin is a very nice place to be. The front seats are spaciously comfortable with good all-round visibility for the driver although rear legroom is only adequate.\n\nWhat's new is the NX's LFA supercar-inspired touches, such as the cosmetic screw bolts, leather-wrapped metal and boost gauge. The remote touch interface now features a laptop-like touchpad and is less sensitive than the mouse in current cars. There is also a wireless phone charger in the centre armrest. And for aural entertainment, the Active Sound Control function allows more engine and exhaust sound to be piped into the cabin.\n\nWith its new styling, engine and features, the NX is certainly a very different type of Lexus.\n\nsamuelee@sph.com.sg\n\nSPECS\n\nThe Lexus NX200t\n\nEngine\n\n1,998cc turbocharged\n\nGearbox\n\n6-speed automatic transmission\n\nMax power\n\n238 hp @ 4,800-5,600 rpm\n\nMax torque\n\n350 Nm @ 1,650-4,000 rpm\n\n0-100 kmh\n\n7.1 secs\n\nTop speed\n\n200 kmh\n\nDistributor\n\nBorneo Motors\n\nTel\n\n6631 1388\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Nor is it beautiful.\n\nBig AND beautiful, in a ground-shifting way, could have been that elusive deal where CIMB hooks up with Malaysia's largest bank Maybank and, with a fire power of $370 billion in combined assets, high jump to the second spot as South-east Asia's largest lender, scattering for the first time the stranglehold of Singapore's banking heavyweights in the top three spots.\n\nThat - the making of a formidable regional champion - would be worthy of the celebratory drumbeat of the kompang to mark national pride. But not this. This tripartite merger, which will vault the enlarged entity just one rung higher and depose Maybank to become Malaysia's largest bank by merely a 6 per cent gap in assets, while a Malaysian bank still remains stuck in fourth place in the region, is a deal deserving of the \"jaguh kampung\" (village champion) pride variety.\n\n\"It (the deal) is merely an incremental jump for CIMB . . . not a quantum leap,\" remarks a disappointed observer.\n\nWhen viewed deeper, beneath the lure of scale - muscling up on deposit base brings down funding cost, a wider clientele and plumper shareholders' funds opens up more regional opportunities - the value proposition of the deal, sans details, is somewhat murky.\n\nFor one thing, the merger of CIMB and RHB, Malaysia's second and fourth largest lenders, spawns a duplication dilemma, in client and portfolio mix, branch networks in Malaysia as well as the region and revenue streams, all of which could force big cuts. MBSB's role in the merger is mystifying; as an exempt finance company, it can do financing without a banking licence. Why would two licensed banks be drawn to such a business?\n\nMBSB, controlled by Malaysia's Employees Provident Fund (EPF), has put much of its bitter past of big losses and bad loans behind it, but it is no stand-out performer in the fund's portfolio. Residual bad loans remain as reflected by its high non-performing loan ratio of 7.6 per cent, still nowhere close to the 40 per cent peak some seven years ago.\n\nMerging with MBSB - a big part of its business is property financing and loans to civil servants - at a time when interest rates are clicking higher and Malaysia's household debt has stomped to a lofty 87 per cent of gross domestic product - could be risky business.\n\nThen there's RHB, a steady bank but one whose full potential has yet to be realised and not too long ago was hit by a talent drain at the top. For EPF, which scooped up the majority stake in the bank seven years ago, RHB is a reminder that it's best for the fund to stay with its key mandate - to preserve and reap best returns on contributors' mandatory retirement savings, not run a bank.\n\nFor that reason, more than any other party, EPF needs this merger-cum-rescue deal to pull through. But there's a big regulatory block to navigate - given its stake in all three firms and the conflict of interests, the fund may not get to vote on the merger. As majority owner of RHB and MBSB and if allowed to vote, EPF could very well dictate the outcome of the mega merger.\n\nThis, in turn, could serve an opening for Mr Nazir, backed no doubt by a talented pool of legal and finance experts, to show off his corporate finesse and fashion a remedy for that snag or risk the deal being stonewalled.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/foodie-wake-call-havelock-enclave", "site_title": "Foodie wake-up call for Havelock enclave", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nFoodie wake-up call for Havelock enclave\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jul 11, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE buzz over new businesses in hipster-saturated Tiong Bahru may have died down, but not before spreading its hum to nearby Havelock Road and Bukit Ho Swee.\n\nThe sleepy neighbourhood - once known for little more than its stretch of popular Teochew restaurants - is slowly stirring to life, thanks to contemporary new startups such as Sin Lee Foods and The Tastemaker Store.\n\n\"Tiong Bahru was dead before Forty Hands moved in,\" recalls Sin Lee Foods' founder Sean Lee, 24, who lives in Kim Tian Road and watched the area transform into the lively network of cafes that it is now. \"Forty Hands took a gamble and it paid off - just like we are taking a gamble with this neighbourhood now. If we don't try, we won't know.\"\n\nBesides, the ageing neighbourhood has plenty going for it, say business owners there. It is a three-minute walk from Tiong Bahru MRT, and sits between Raffles Place, Chinatown and shopping malls such as Great World City and those along Orchard Road. Well-heeled expatriates from the condominiums in River Valley make the occasional stopover after running their errands in Tiong Bahru.\n\nPlus, Havelock Road is no less steeped in historical significance than its more famous neighbour: it's among one of the older public housing estates in Singapore, and there was that historic fire that blazed through Bukit Ho Swee in 1961.\n\nBut chief of all its attractions is the deep sense of community, say the new entrants. \"I wanted to be in an area that had some local life. The alternative to this was for me to rent within an office block or a light industrial estate - but neither of those were appealing. It's nice to be part of a neighbourhood,\" explains Sasha Conlan, who runs a 300 sq ft office and pick-up point for her online food retailer The Barbie Girls at the bottom of a Havelock Road HDB block.\n\n\"Now the shop owners in the area all know us, we know the juice stall owner, the doctor, the pizza delivery boys from down the row,\" the chatty Briton says.\n\nThough she admits the common areas could do with some physical sprucing up, it isn't lacking in buzz. A new cluster of HDB flats at Havelock View completed in 2011 brought in young families to recently revitalise the otherwise ageing estate predominantly made up of blocks of two and three-room flats.\n\n\"The crowd is really a mix, there are older people but there are also a lot of school kids,\" observes Alvin Peh, of month-old minimalist cafe The Tastemaker Store. \"On weekends, we get a lot of families who come here to visit their grandparents.\"\n\nWhile gentrification is some way off, \"it will happen because of its central location,\" predicts Ms Conlan. Sin Lee's Mr Lee thinks the area could do with a few more modern bookshops, photography shops and art galleries, adding however that \"it really depends on who is operating them.\"\n\n\"If you're just here to be cool or to leech off the hipster market, that is the wrong idea,\" he says. \"We hope the new business owners will be just as passionate about the business they want to open, with the ultimate aim of attracting more people here so they can also learn about the area's rich history.\"\n\nSin Lee Foods\n\nBlk 4 Jalan Bukit Ho Swee #01-164 Tel 6377 3170\n\nHours: 10am-9pm (Tue-Sun)\n\nDON'T belittle its humble HDB void deck location, or its by-now-ubiquitous design template of exposed brick walls and concrete floors - Sin Lee Foods is one little cafe with big ambitions.\n\nThe couple who run the week-old eatery may be young, but they flaunt notable culinary chops. Jerraldine Chen, 23, was previously a trainee sommelier at Les Amis and recently completed a kitchen internship at Eleven Madison Park in New York, while Sean Lee, 24, worked at Dolce Vita at the Mandarin Oriental Singapore when it was helmed by Michelin-starred chef Marco Pedrelli, then the now-defunct Guy Savoy at the Marina Bay Sands, and two years ago headed the Singapore youth culinary team. The duo also run hole-in-the-wall creperie Batter in the National University Hospital Medical Centre.\n\nTheir 50-seater sophomore business venture in Havelock Road occupies the space previously tenanted by Sin Lee Coffeeshop, a famous lor mee and prawn mee stall whose elderly operators retired in January this year, after a half-century of running the business.\n\nIn Mr Lee and Ms Chen's hands, the 900 sq ft space - including a breezy al fresco pavilion - serves up a safe, crowd-pleasing menu of sandwiches, truffle fries, and egg-centric dishes targeted at weekend brunch seekers, such as an egg shakshuka ($17.90), a croissant royale of smoked salmon and poached eggs ($16.90), and their signature dish of crispy fried chicken on waffles ($21.90).\n\nOnce business picks up, however, the couple plan to add on bolder, Momofuku-inspired fusion creations such as beef with medium grain rice in prawn broth, fries coated with salted egg yolk sauce with crispy curry leaves, and kimchi-accented softshell crab buns. But despite endless customer suggestions, lor mee pasta or a similar tribute to the coffee shop's past is not in the works, they say. Just in case you ask.\n\nThe Tastemaker Store\n\nBlk 22 Havelock Road #01-705\n\nHours: 9am-9pm daily\n\ninfo@thetastemakerstore.com\n\nA trio of siblings who all have day jobs pool their various skills together to run Tastemaker, a month-old cafe in an HDB void deck near Beo Crescent.\n\nEldest brother and operations specialist Alvin Peh, middle sister Stacy and engineer and youngest brother Shing Jie, all in their 20s, took over the space from their 98-year-old grandfather who ran the traditional bookshop Shing Lee Books there from 1965 until he finally retired last year.\n\nMinimalist furniture and stark white walls conceptualised by architecture student Stacy give the space a Monocle cafe-meets-Muji store sheen, and makes it visually unmissable among a row of pet shops and antiquated provision stores. The menu offers Western cakes, kopitiam bites such as homemade glutinous rice and yam cakes, and mixed heritage new creations such as kaya toast - kaya and clotted cream on a pillowy soft English muffin.\n\nThe best part? Items cost only $3 to $5.50 for a kaya toast and Americano coffee set - so don't be surprised to see middle-aged residents swapping gossip next to university-aged patrons in black-rimmed glasses typing away on their Macbook Air.\n\nIt's titled a store and not a cafe for a reason: the Pehs hope to work with local artists, musicians and designers to carry merchandise and showcase their works in the two-storey double unit's currently unused second floor.\n\nThe Barbie Girls\n\nBlk 22 Havelock Road #01-683\n\nTel 8613-1104\n\nwww.thebarbiegirls.com\n\nFounded by British former lawyer Sasha Conlan, The Barbie Girls is an online gourmet meat and seafood retail shop specialising in sustainably farmed and hormone and antibiotic-free poultry, seafood and red meats largely imported from New Zealand, Australia and Europe.\n\nThe three-year-old business expanded into the Havelock Road unit a year ago, and though it isn't exactly a retail store - the 300 sq ft space serves as Ms Conlan and assistant Jennifer Anderson's administrative office and physical pick-up point for customers who would rather not await home delivery - they will entertain limited walk-in enquiries.\n\nBesides charcuterie, cheeses and pantry essentials such as sauces and stocks, look out for their Barbie Meals, or frozen lasagna and meatball ready meals, along with meat and seafood packs designed to feed two to four persons for a week, and barbecue bundles for groups of 10 or 20 - a handy resource for time-strapped modern families.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Over the last four seasons, he has played a crucial role in translating the script and the director's vision onto paper, to give everyone visuals to work with before they actually began to shoot.\n\n\"The thing I've learnt about storyboarding is it has to follow a clear logic - the logic of camera. Where you place cameras on screen is very important for an audience to understand the show,\" says Simpson, who hails from Northern Ireland. \"I work with five different directors on most days, and every director has a different approach to shooting. Some need very precise storyboards that they stick to absolutely, while others just use it as a guide to what they're going to shoot.\"\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But those 20 minutes are enough for him to remember every detail of all the buildings and roads he can see from his bird's eye view, down to the last tree, window and street lamp.\n\nHe then reproduces what he's seen in his large drawings accurately and painstakingly over several days, relying solely on his photographic memory rather than maps and pictures. This feat has made him something of an artistic sensation around the world. He's frequently invited to different cities to illustrate their skylines.\n\nNext week, Wiltshire is set to carry out the feat here in Singapore. On Tuesday, he's taking a helicopter ride sponsored by the RSAF around the Central Business District. Subsequently, he will station himself at Paragon shopping mall from July 16 to 20 to draw the Singapore skyline on a four metre by one metre canvas. The public can watch him work at the mall's atrium from 10am to 5pm daily, with one-hour breaks at 1.30pm.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/space-van", "site_title": "Space van", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nSpace van\n\nThe Suzuki Solio is an ultra-compact minivan with a surprisingly roomy cabin. By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jul 11, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHERE is something strangely fascinating about a small van. Perhaps it's the boxy proportions and the ample cabin versatility. Or maybe it's due to a secret desire to drive a breadvan. Whatever the reason, one thing is certain - the diminutive Japanese minivan has not made financial sense since COE premiums began skyrocketing. Until now. Enter the Suzuki Solio, the successor to the Wagon R+ of the late 1990s. The car Solio was actually launched two years ago in Japan but facelifted for 2014, but it remains interesting enough as a model that is ultra-compact on the outside but surprisingly spacious on the inside.\n\nAt 3,710 mm long and 1,765 mm high, the Solio is a tall car with a very large greenhouse. One eye-catching styling cue is the smooth aerodynamic polycarbonate grille, a feature usually found in more high-end Japanese cars.\n\nAlso interesting is that the Solio has two rear electric sliding doors. With its low floor, this means access to the rear bench is convenient. Once ensconced in the rear, the spaciousness is obvious.\n\nHeadroom is not an issue and neither is legroom, because the back seats, which are split 50:50, can slide forwards or backwards independently for a limo-like interior. So even if the 2,450 mm wheelbase doesn't sound like much, it doesn't matter.\n\nOf course, when the back bench is adjusted for maximum legroom, the boot area is compromised. But if not in use, the two rear seats can be folded flat into the floor for maximum cargo space.\n\nTo drive its front wheels, the Solio has a 1.2-litre four-cylinder engine mated to a continuously variable transmission.\n\nWith a low kerb weight of 1,045 kg, the naturally aspirated unit is surprisingly adequate in hauling the Solio around briskly. The CVT is helpful too in ensuring there is sufficient pep across the small rev range.\n\nThe steering wheel is only adjustable for height but it still allows for a decent driving position. With its compact proportions and good all-round visibility, the Solio is the ideal city car. Body roll is acceptable in corners and the CG doesn't feel as high as it looks. The frugal engine also produces excellent fuel economy - Suzuki lists consumption at 18.8 km per litre.\n\nOther highlights include the centre walk-through aisle between the two front seats, a pail-like \"underbox\" below the front passenger seat, auto headlamps and auto aircon. When something so spacious is this easy to drive and park, small really is beautiful.\n\nsamuelee@sph.com.sg\n\nSPECS\n\nSuzuki Solio\n\nEngine\n\n1,242cc\n\nGearbox\n\nContinuously variable transmission\n\nMax power\n\n91 hp @ 6,000 rpm\n\nMax torque\n\n118 Nm @ 4,800 rpm\n\n0-100 kmh\n\n13.5 secs\n\nTop speed\n\n155 kmh\n\nCO2 emissions\n\n127 g/km\n\nAverage OMV\n\n$13,500\n\nPrice\n\nfrom $96,900 (with COE)\n\nDistributor\n\nChampion Motors\n\nTel\n\n6631 1118\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/uob-continues-be-limelight", "site_title": "UOB continues to be in the limelight", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nUOB continues to be in the limelight\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jul 11, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIN recent months, the outperformance of United Overseas Bank has provided one of the standout features of local stocks, and so it was again this week.\n\nNo one knows for sure why the counter has proven so popular, but those invested in the Straits Times Index have plenty of cause to be grateful - in yesterday's session, UOB's sudden 83- cent or 3.6 per cent jump to a seven-year high of $24.03 added almost 12 points to the index which, when added to the gains posted by DBS and SingTel, helped propel the index a total of 24.23 points higher to 3,293.73.\n\nThe bank was queried by the Singapore Exchange but had not replied by the time trading ended.\n\nYesterday's rise brought the index's gain for the week to 21 points or 0.7 per cent and its year-to-date return to 4 per cent.\n\nTurnover, however, has been a source of major disappointment for many months now and there were no signs of improvement this week. In yesterday's session, and even with elevated volume in the banks, only 1.2 billion units worth $845 million were traded by the whole market, the second-lowest haul for the week after Monday's $727 million.\n\nThe soccer World Cup may be partly to blame - remisiers who have stayed up until the early hours of the day to watch the matches played in Brazil may find it not worth their while to go in to office afterwards - but poor liquidity has afflicted all other Asean markets as well, not just Singapore.\n\nReasons why UOB has been in play are not entirely clear. Some observers speak of superior earnings, others describe it as the \"least unattractive\" of the three local banks - OCBC is struggling with its purchase of Hong Kong's Wing Hang Bank and the capital overhang issues the deal creates, while DBS's margins and therefore profitability are thought to be thinner than UOB's. If so, then funds looking for banking exposure are by default left with UOB.\n\nMacquarie Warrants (MW) in its daily report yesterday said that among the three Singapore banks, UOB has the highest net interest margin and the highest underlying profitability profile. It said Macquarie Equities Research (MER) expects that UOB's return on tangible book adjusted for leverage will remain one to 1.5 per cent higher compared to DBS or OCBC.\n\n\"This is a result of UOB's Asean focus versus the lower margin Greater China exposure of DBS (and OCBC),\" said MW. \"MER increased their adjusted earnings per share estimates by 7, 6 and 9 per cent for 2014E, 2015E and 2016E respectively, by assuming positive operating leverage and still good growth in UOB's overseas markets. Given UOB's strong capital position, MER's model for 80- and 85-cent dividends per share from 2014 and 2015 earnings will put them 7 per cent ahead of current market expectations.\" It added that MER has revised its 12-month target for UOB from $21.88 to $25.30.\n\nOutside of blue chips, activity during the week had a distinct offshore marine/shipping/oil and gas feel to it. Perhaps the biggest development was Ezra Holdings' Thursday announcement that it plans to place all its offshore support service assets with its Norwegian-listed unit EOC and then for EOC to gain a secondary listing here. Although Ezra shares rose 1.5 cents yesterday, over the course of the week, they fell four cents to $1.195.\n\nEzion Holdings, in the meantime, also saw its shares come under pressure during the week, losing 10 cents at $2.01, despite a 3.5-cent bounce yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So when we come in, we provide the due diligence and the imprimatur of the US government in support of a transaction.\"\n\nThis in turn catalyses lending from the banks, or reduces the lending costs for the borrower, typically an importer of US goods or services.\n\nThe bank is actively engaged in promoting trade with Asia. \"There has certainly been a pivot towards Asia,\" said Mr Hochberg. Close to 40 per cent of Ex-Im Bank's portfolio is in Asia, which is defined to include Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIn FY 2013, the bank financed US$9.7 billion in projects in Asia, although this was down from US$13.5 billion in 2012. Its total exposure in Asia was US$46.5 billion at the end of FY 2013.\n\nThe Ex-Im Bank typically provides financing for large projects in such industries as petrochemicals, power generation, oil & gas, satellites and aviation.\n\nIn FY 2013, it provided financing for US exports related to broadcast satellites in Hong Kong, a liquefied natural gas project in Queensland, Australia and agricultural aircraft in China. In Singapore, it has financed US-supplied equipment for semiconductor manufacturer Micron Technology, which has established semiconductor fabrication, assembly and testing facilities here; the bank's total exposure to Singapore was US$2.07 billion at the end of FY 2013.\n\nEx-Im Bank is particularly active in supporting purchases of commercial aircraft from US manufacturers.\n\nMr Hochberg said: \"When Lion Air was launched, its purchases of the Boeing 737-900 ER, the larger version of the Boeing 737, were financed 85 per cent by the US Ex-Im Bank.\"\n\nHe explained that new-generation aircraft are difficult for banks to finance, because \"the market doesn't know what their residual values are\".\n\nWhen production takes the form of value chains - where the parts of a product are manufactured in different countries - the Ex-Im Bank co-finances the purchase, covering the US-made portion, while other ECAs finance the portions made in their respective countries.\n\nFor example, Mr Hochberg said, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is partly manufactured in the US and partly in Japan. \"So Ex-Im Bank and Nexi (Nippon Export and Investment Insurance, Japan's export-credit agency) together co-finance those planes. So if someone buys a 787, it's partly financed by the United States, partly by Japan.\"\n\nHe said globalised supply chains are more common now than even just five years ago. \"More globalised supply chains require more global solutions,\" he said. Ex-Im Bank has done co-financing with ECAs in China, Australia and Japan, which means its activities support jobs in those countries.\n\nOf the growing competition Ex-Im Bank faces from ECAs and other government lending bodies, Mr Hochberg acknowledged that the Ex-Im Bank is less competitive than its counterparts in, for example, China, Japan and Korea, which offer extremely generous terms for buyers of goods from their countries.\n\n\"Some countries will leave no stone unturned in an effort to support their manufacturers,\" he said.\n\nThe Ex-Im Bank is constrained in the financing terms it can offer by having to adhere to standards set by the OECD. \"The OECD has something called 'the arrangement',\" he said. \"This is about transparency as well as minimal fee and a maximum tenor or number of years (for loans). If you follow those rules, the World Trade Organisation says you're not providing a subsidy.\"\n\nThe Ex-Im Bank supports this arrangement, he added. \"We want our products to compete on their own merits, on the basis of entrepreneurship and ingenuity and not have the government try to tip the scales.\"\n\nWhile 31 countries adhere to the OECD arrangement, several others do not, including the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China).\n\nSome OECD members such as Korea and Japan even provide forms of financing that fall outside the purview of the OECD arrangement.\n\n\"Fifteen years ago, 100 per cent of export financing was under the OECD framework. That has dropped to one third,\" said Mr Hochberg. \"Close to US$200 billion worth of financing is unregulated and opaque. That is a challenge because if there are two products competing, and one of them has got the benefit of financial subsidies and sweeteners, that tilts the (buyer's) decision - and in opaque ways that you can't tell.\n\n\"If I know what the terms are, I can compete, but if I don't know what the terms are, it's very hard to compete.\"\n\nOn the issue of members of the US Congress questioning the need for the Ex-Im Bank, he said: \"We in the US believe in limited government. We want the market to do as much as it can. So there is a debate going on about the role of government in supporting exports.\"\n\nBut he added: \"With such enormous investment globally in infrastructure and such a brutally competitive environment, this is not the time to talk about a more modest Ex-Im Bank in the US.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He started painting on both paper and canvas, enjoying the differences between the two textures, and the visual effects they rendered. \"Rice paper, for example, has a sheen to it, and because it doesn't absorb the oil so fast, the colours turn out slightly different,\" shares the 73-year-old.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

One-year total shareholder return was 1.5 per cent, underperforming its internal risk-adjusted hurdle rate of 8 per cent by a wide margin. It also underperformed common equity indices: the S&P 500 returned 21 per cent, and the MSCI All Country Asia index chalked up a 3 per cent gain. The longer-term track record also appears mixed. Annualised returns since inception in 1974 were impressive at 16 per cent, but the 20-year return of 6 per cent failed to beat its hurdle rate of 9 per cent. Yet comparing Temasek's performance against market indices runs into the classic error of likening apples with oranges. This is because the portfolio is concentrated - over 50 per cent of its holdings are in Singapore and China. It also has about 30 per cent in unlisted assets.\n\nThe bigger question is how well it is delivering \"sustainable long-term value\" through four themes. These include investments in transforming economies, a growing middle class and emerging champions. Its heavy weighting in Singapore and China suggests that it sees a good part of these themes playing out in those areas. To be sure, its portfolio holdings in the transport and industrials sector are strategic assets, such as Singapore Airlines, PSA International and Keppel Corp. But are these corporations able to deliver growth?\n\nClearly Temasek is betting on Asia as the region most likely to generate growth, evident in its 72 per cent portfolio exposure to Asia. It cites continuing macro uncertainties in Europe and the US; it expects economic growth of under 3 per cent in the US. Yet an expectation of relatively strong economic growth does not necessarily translate into robust returns, as numerous investors in China's equity market have rued. In any case, developments in recent years have highlighted Asia's economic vulnerabilities - its dependence not only on consumption in mature markets, but also on the region's largest economies, China and India, both of which currently face economic challenges.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

While prices dropped 0.6 per cent from May, they jumped 4 per cent that month, the most since October 2002.\n\n\"Housing demand continues to be supported by an economic recovery that is gathering pace,\" said Stephen Noakes, mortgages director at Halifax. Employment levels and \"rising consumer confidence\" should also boost the market, he said.\n\nPrices were up 9.4 per cent last month from a year earlier, Halifax said. In the second quarter, they were up 8.8 per cent from the same period in 2013, the biggest increase since 2007.\n\nMonthly movements \"can be volatile and the quarter on quarter change is a more reliable indicator of the underlying trend\", Halifax said.\n\nConcerns that the UK property market may be at risk of overheating prompted Bank of England (BOE) Governor Mark Carney to announce measures last month to limit risky mortgages and prevent an unsustainable buildup of consumer debt.\n\nSome other surveys have suggested that the momentum in values may be easing. Last month, Rightmove plc reported a slowing in home-price inflation and the BOE has said that new lending rules introduced in April may restrict mortgage approvals. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

The simian characters in this movie (directed by Matt Reeves and written by Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver) are more human than several of their human counterparts: a damning indictment of the human race perhaps, but also an indication of just how far digital technology and performance-capture techniques have come.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

His father Ng Teng Fong founded the company 31 years earlier. It has become Singapore's largest private property developer, with 750 properties in the residential, hospitality, retail, commercial and industrial sectors.\n\nA notable philanthropist, Mr Ng has given generously to universities and educational institutions here. The new Jurong General Hospital in Singapore is to be named after his father, following a donation of more than US$95 million by the Ng family in March 2011, Wealth-X reported.\n\nThe list of the top 10 billionaires here includes several non-Singaporeans - individuals who have set up their primary business addresses here and live here.\n\nThese include Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, a 32-year old Brazilian who sits in second spot on the list with a net worth of US$4.2 billion. The youngest on the list, he reportedly moved to Singapore in 2009 and renounced his US citizenship ahead of Facebook filing its initial public offering in 2012; it was a move that saved him millions of dollars in taxes.\n\nComing in third is New Zealander Richard Chandler, whose diversified investments through his Chandler Corporation have earned him US$2.8 billion.\n\nHe reportedly got into business in 1986 when he and his brother Christopher sold their parents' retailing business in Hong Kong to set up Sovereign Global, which invested in emerging markets. Mr Chandler started out here on his own when the brothers split in 2006.\n\nAmong the foreigners on the list are Indonesian Sukanto Tanoto of Royal Golden Eagle, in fifth place with US$2.3 billion, and American/Canadian mining tycoon Robert Martin Friedland of Ivanhoe Capital, in eighth position with US$1.9 billion to his name.\n\nAnother commodity player on the list is Wilmar International's Kuok Khoon Hong, who takes fourth place with US$2.4 billion.\n\nThe new owner of Valencia football club Peter Lim is sixth on the list with a net worth of US$2.2 billion, with Goh Cheng Liang of Wuthelam Holdings just behind him with US$2.1 billion.\n\nLim Oon Kuin of Hin Leong Group and Goi Seng Hui of Tee Yih Jia Group are in ninth and 10th spots, with a net worth of US$1.8 billion each.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He is executive director of agency services, overseeing all residential, office, industrial and retail services.\n\n\"I couldn't have picked a better time to rejoin Knight Frank. The market is tough, competition is hot, real estate issues are complex, attracting and retaining talent is getting harder and harder. Overall, it's going to be fun,\" he quipped when contacted by BT yesterday.\n\nThe 56-year-old said his core focus will be cross-selling the services of the four departments and restrategising their business focus. He will also focus on leadership development.\n\nMr Tay spent 12 years at Knight Frank before leaving the company in 2005 as head of consultancy and research. He was also once the office leasing head for about three years.\n\nHe then joined Pacific Star Group, where he spent five years, rising to executive vice-president of fund management. Next stop was Straits Trading, where he was consultant for one-and-a-half years, before joining National University Of Singapore's Department of Real Estate as an associate professor for two years. He left his NUS post in May this year.\n\nIn a statement issued by Knight Frank yesterday, Mr Tay said: \"I hope the experience gained from my sojourn away from the company the past nine years can help build superior performance and a more enduring legacy for the company.\"\n\nMr Tay, a father of two and a former Anglo-Chinese School boy, holds a Bachelor of Science degree in estate management from NUS in addition to a Master of Arts in business administration from the University of Georgia.\n\nDanny Yeo, group managing director at Knight Frank, said: \"Kah Poh will help me look after the four departments, especially the business development aspect. His familiarity with our Knight Frank culture and his contacts base will aid him in this task.\n\n\"In addition, Kah Poh will head our in-house Knight Frank Training Academy - which offers a suite of modules and classes for all staff not only to satisfy Council of Estate Agents requirements but also soft skills such as negotiations and emotional quotient.

It's for this simple reason that he and his team will stage The Pillowman as their year-old theatre company's second production at the Drama Centre Black Box next week.\n\n\"As a director, I'm basically a storyteller.

Although temporarily disrupted by the global financial crisis (GFC) in 2008, the resurgence of \"great moderation\" dynamics post-crisis seemed to have once again helped to support the sustained performance of US equities over the last five years. I believe that the experience of the \"Great Moderation\" holds considerable relevance for equity investors in Asia as it shifts to a slower pace of growth.\n\nAre the conditions for a \"Great Moderation\" starting to fall into place in Asia? The answer to this appears to be positive as the policy emphasis in Asia has already shifted towards the sustainability of growth rather than just the quantum of it. Under the leadership of President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang, for example, China's growth target has been guided down to the 7-7.5 per cent level as they push ahead with multi-faceted fiscal and monetary reforms. In India, the Bharatiya Janata Party's recent landslide victory has provided the new government with a strong mandate to realise the country's full economic potential.\n\nMeanwhile, the political climate in South-east Asia has also evolved into one whereby economic performance is high on the scorecard in determining who gets to run the country - and in Indonesia and the Philippines, Presidents Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Benigno Aquino have set the bar high for their successors to come. As Asia becomes more integrated, the momentum of sustainable policies sweeping across the region is stirring up a virtuous cycle that is gathering up the beginnings of a \"New Moderation\" - and in the fullness of time, we could well be speaking of Asia's own \"Great Moderation\".\n\nThe prospect of sustained yet more moderate economic growth in Asia will have considerable implications for corporates and hence for equities. Corporate Asia should recognise that the era of ultra-high growth is over. The game of survival is no longer about chasing the topline. Companies positioned for high growth have already found themselves burdened by potentially lethal cost structures.\n\nThe ability to control costs becomes not just a question of profitability but a dimension to competitive survival. In the Asia-Pacific ex-Japan region, Australian companies are particularly adept at this - Brambles, Amcor, Woolworths, Orora and BHP are just a few of the businesses that have multi-year cost-cutting programmes in place to create bottom-line growth in the face of a more challenging topline outlook. They also focus on sustainable cash-flow generation to anchor the balance sheet and, ultimately, the dividend-yield. The beauty of such companies is that their return potential for investors can be reliably satisfying over a more prolonged period.\n\nThe question remains of how investors should position themselves for this \"New Moderation\" era, with the near-term challenges to growth in Asia. In China, for example, we will be waiting for sector-specific dampening measures to complete their course, such as the anti-corruption measures affecting luxury goods and the restrictions to curb property speculation - but once done, a fresh revenue trajectory for the affected companies may ensue with a streamlined cost base to boot.\n\nBeneath the surface of the \"slowdown\" headlines, there are also pockets of more exciting growth which behoove investors to be selectively engaged. Although growth overall is decelerating, sectors such as life insurance, railway infrastructure, e-commerce and online media are still expanding rapidly - in these, fierce competitive battles are still being waged and aggressive strategies remain relevant.\n\nMore importantly, however, investors should seek out the growing opportunities for quality growth. To recap, \"New Moderation\" growth will be characterised by sustainability at a stabilised level, moored alongside more level-headed government and corporate behaviour - this means Asia's secular growth may be given the chance to stretch for longer, translating into a prolonged harvesting period for resilient growth opportunities in companies that are geared towards its secular themes.\n\nAs corporates focus more on growing profits and less on chasing revenues, better cash flows and dividend payouts should also follow. Companies that are reaping these rewards are most numerous in the developed Asian markets of Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia, where corporate cultures are more shareholder-friendly. But for such opportunities not to be missed, investors must be willing to harvest dividends over a multi-year horizon, and tune their expectations of share-price appreciation to more realistic levels.\n\nAsia's \"New Moderation\" should also provide many opportunities for investors who are armed with a contrarian approach. The greatest opportunities could be in sectors where market sentiment has been most depressed, such as the Chinese banks. An acceleration in shadow-banking credit and the fear that non-performing loans will escalate has spooked investor confidence, and China's banks are now trading at around 5x price-to-earnings with a dividend yield of around 6 per cent, despite efforts by regulators at tightening controls and various reforms to reduce systemic risks. The re-rating process may take time but investors can enjoy an attractive yield while they wait for the dark clouds to roll away.\n\nChina's anti-corruption clean-up provides other contrarian opportunities - for example, interest in the railway sector is returning, lured by its multi-year growth story and the world-class capabilities of companies within it. Efforts at reforms and transparency are also starting to emerge in its oil and gas sector, as in PetroChina's plans to invite private capital to take stakes in its oil pipelines.\n\nAdapting to new realities takes time. Some ships are easier to steer than others - the contrarian eye should focus on the direction it is heading. A stock may be sold down but can provide an exciting opportunity if the managers of the underlying business understand the challenges they face and have started to take the steps necessary to survive and thrive.\n\nThe opportunities open up further if we also look at improvements in corporate governance. In South Korea, decades of sub-par practices among conglomerates may be finally beginning to change as the surrender of control by founding patriarchs open the way to corporate restructuring that holds scope for positive outcomes for minority shareholders.\n\nWe are already two years into Asia's slowdown, and the overall region could be a contrarian opportunity given its recent underperformance. As the base of comparison shifts and growth stabilises, it will become increasingly difficult for the market to remain manic about a \"slowdown\" while progressively soothed with data that shows a consistent level of growth. Consequently, flows should return to Asia at some point as the region's relatively high growth rate attracts attention.\n\nThe writer is head of Asian equities, Threadneedle Investments\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The revised national health insurance scheme will offer lifelong coverage and better protection come end-2015.\n\nIn his closing speech yesterday, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong stressed that co-payment remains a key safeguard to prevent overconsumption and to deliver cost-effective treatments. An annual cap on out-of-pocket payments - as mooted by Nominated MP Mary Liew - could encourage \"unnecessary consumption beyond the cap\", which is why some level of co-payment must remain a fixture, he pointed out. As suggested by some MPs, he said that the government would keep a close watch on insurance claims and healthcare consumption patterns. It will also work with healthcare providers and insurers to better manage healthcare inflation, which could end up pushing premiums higher in time to come.\n\nBut while the government has committed some $4 billion in financial aid for MediShield Life over the next five years, Mr Gan said the government does not plan to raise taxes to pay for these MediShield subsidies. \"Whether taxes have to be raised in future depends on our overall spending and our overall revenues in government,\" he stressed.\n\nAlthough total healthcare spending in Singapore is set to increase significantly over the next decade, the government will work with healthcare providers to curb healthcare cost increases, while also ensuring it has the revenues needed over the next decade to cover the increase.\n\nThe MLRC also suggested that sufficient reserves be set aside to ensure the long-term sustainability of MediShield Life. Mr Gan said: \"The reserves enable MediShield to honour not just current-year claims but also long-term commitments such as continuing claims for dialysis and cancer treatments, and premium rebates for the older age groups.\"\n\nMerely balancing annual premiums to match yearly payouts would mean that the scheme would not be able to meet continuing commitments for long-term patients or premium rebates, he pointed out.\n\nTackling a point by Non-Constituency MP Gerald Giam who questioned the need for MediShield Fund's targeted capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 200 per cent, Mr Gan said that the target is \"broadly in line\" with industry practice and recommended by MediShield's appointed actuary to ensure that the Fund can meet its liabilities to policyholders even in adverse scenarios such as worse-than-expected claims or a major fall in investment returns. As at end last year, MediShield Life's CAR was 157 per cent.\n\nMr Gan also cautioned against suggestions of a premium ceiling for the elderly or flat premiums for all age groups as this would lead to intergenerational cross-subsidy where the young end up paying for the elderly given an ageing population. \"Instead, what we have done is to determine the premium on an actuarial basis, as recommended by the committee, while putting in place government subsidies and additional support to help the older generation and the needy with their premiums.\"\n\nIn response to MPs such as Fatimah Lateef on the use of annual value of homes to ascertain eligibility for premium subsidies, Mr Gan said that those who are not eligible for the premium subsidies can appeal if they need financial help and will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Premium subsidies will not be given to those with an annual home value above $21,000 but all Singaporeans will receive transitional subsidies for the first four years.\n\n\"For those unable to afford their premiums after premium subsidies, the government will also provide additional premium support,\" said Mr Gan, adding that no Singaporean would drop out due to an inability to pay premiums.\n\nIn calculating MediShield Life premiums - which will be higher than current premiums in line with the better coverage - several factors were considered based on actuarial principles, such as the benefits and expected claims experience, provision for premium rebates for policyholders when they grow older as well as provisions for reserves, capital and administrative costs for the scheme.\n\nMeanwhile, those with pre-existing conditions are being brought in under MediShield Life but will pay an additional 30 per cent of the premium for the first 10 years. In line with their higher risks, the figure should have been more but the committee recommended 30 per cent so it wouldn't be too burdensome on this group.\n\nMr Gan said: \"The ministry is currently reviewing the types of pre-existing medical conditions which will be subject to additional premiums, and will share more details when ready.\"\n\nAnd while he said that the government would study the MLRC's recommendation to bolster the regulatory and accountability framework for Integrated Shield Plan (IP) insurers, he also highlighted that it would be mindful not to over-regulate IPs since stringent requirements could end up limiting choice or cause higher premiums for policyholders.\n\nFor an infographic summarizing MediShield Life, click here.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Hong Kong follows Singapore closely under these terms.\n\nThe weak margins from Singapore banks reflect a saturated domestic market, and the lenders' conservative nature in making foreign loans - which made up 47 per cent of all their loans at the end of last year - said Eugene Tarzimanov, Moody's senior credit officer, financial institutions group, at a press briefing.\n\n\"It reflects the banks' risk appetite,\" he said, noting that Singapore banks are also willing to cut back on pricing for their regional loans, sacrificing profitability for volume. Margins from overseas loans are slightly stronger than those from loans made in Singapore, he added.\n\nAlso, banks hope that regional banking customers extend their relationship beyond trade finance loans to cash management services, boosting the banks' fee income, said Stephen Long, managing director, financial institutions, at Moody's, at the briefing.\n\nStill, the lack of scale is an issue for funding costs, especially when competing against the network of each Asian country's domestic banks. The market share of local banks in places such as China, Indonesia and Malaysia is between 40 and 60 per cent, Moody's said.\n\nAs a result, most regional banks tend to focus on corporate lending, trade finance and wealth management, said Jean-Francois Tremblay, Moody's associate managing director, financial institutions group in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, though, most of Singapore banks' problem loans are from foreign markets, Moody's data showed.\n\nIn particular, the stress comes from loans made in the South-east Asian markets. It is not, as is often feared, from Greater China.\n\nThe problem loans in South-east Asia stood at 2 per cent of the Singapore banks' overall loan book for the first quarter of this year.\n\nIn the post-crisis period, the ratio for problem loans linked to South-east Asia had been falling from 4 per cent in 2008, to about 1.5 per cent in 2012. But that crept up last year.\n\nAll of that compares with a ratio of under one per cent for both problem loans in Singapore and Greater China for the same quarter. This has been the case since 2011, despite the big push by DBS and OCBC into trade finance linked to China.\n\n\"The banks' China exposures will likely continue to grow at a rapid pace over our outlook horizon, in line with their strategies to expand their Chinese operations, against the backdrop of slower growth in Singapore,\" said the Moody's report.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Moreover ship managers were slightly more upbeat - and, of course, Singapore is a major ship management centre.\n\nEven looking at the global scene, confidence levels remain at their second-highest in the past six years. The survey found that expectations of new investment were maintained over the three-month period, but the prospect of higher freight rates softened in the tanker and dry bulk sectors.\n\nUncertainty over the likely effect of an increase in private equity funding, and the consequent potential impact on tonnage supply, dominated the thoughts of respondents in the survey. In May, the average confidence level expressed by respondents in the markets in which they operate was 6.3, compared to the 6.5 recorded in February, which was the highest figure since the 6.8 recorded when the survey was launched in May 2008.\n\nShip managers were the only category of main respondent to report an increase in confidence, up from 6.4 in the previous survey to 6.5 this time. By contrast, owners were down from 6.6 to 6.1, charterers down from 6.5 to 6.1, and brokers were down from 6.4 to 6.0.\n\nGeographically, confidence was stable in Asia at 6.4, but down in Europe and in North America - falling from 6.4 to 6.2 and from 7.1 to 6.5, respectively.\n\nAs usual, the survey collected many pithy views on the current scene. Some were also contradictory. Most appeared at least cautiously optimistic. \"Levels of confidence are good, and are expected to improve,\" said one respondent.\n\nAnother noted: \"World trade seems to be improving, and shipping will benefit.\"\n\nHowever, Moore Stephens says some others were more guarded in their responses. One respondent said: \"The market is improving, but there are still some smaller, financially weak companies likely to go bust.\"\n\nNevertheless, another observed: \"We have noted slight improvements in the market and are confident that more significant growth will take place in the coming months.\" Comments in a similar vein were \"Demand is still high, even though operational costs have tended to increase\" and \"The shipping markets are not stable at the moment, but will pick up shortly.\"\n\nPerhaps the following more pessimistic remark reflects the reality for a significant part of the industry: \"The market has improved slightly, but certainly not enough to start drinking champagne. The next few years will be difficult, and maybe the real recovery will be too little and come too late for some owners.\"\n\nAs usually happens in the shipping industry, even the modest upturn over the past year has led to worries about overcapacity with too many newbuildings being ordered. At present, that seems to be exacerbated by the need for China's now massive shipbuilding industry to stay busy.\n\nOn this topic, one comment was: \"We need to stop ordering newbuildings, particularly in the medium-range tanker and platform supply vessel sectors.\" More bluntly. another respondent said: \"The future is uncertain due to the fact that owners are still ordering too many ships.\"\n\nThe cost of meeting regulatory requirements is beginning to cause real concern. One respondent said: \"Sulphur emissions restrictions and potential ballast water management systems costs are major challenges for the near future.\"\n\nThose worries are more than justified and are likely to become more acute in the second half of this year, in the run-up to much stricter sulphur limits in the Emission Control Areas around North America and Northern Europe.\n\nMoore Stephens shipping partner Richard Greiner has a point when he says: \"Ironically, it is the willingness of investors - and new investors, at that - to put their money into shipping which may lie behind the recent small dip in confidence.\" He notes: \"Some people are already calling this period in the shipping cycle the recovery that never arrived. This works well as a sound bite, but takes no account of the improved levels of confidence we have seen recently. Shipping industry confidence today is vastly improved compared to where it was five years ago. As one of our respondents noted, it may not yet be time to break out the champagne. But neither is it time to subsist solely on beer.\"\n\nOn balance, that optimism seems justified but the big unknown is how technical change and improvements in vessel efficiency are going to affect the market. Will it be worth putting scrubbers and water ballast systems on ships that burn far more fuel than some of those coming out of the shipyards now?\n\nAlready, we are looking at early obsolescence of the panamax ships as the widening of the Panama Canal draws closer to completion. Fuel efficiency advances could also well hasten many ships' move to the scrapyard.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is only the second time in the country's history that they will have a directly elected leader. The election has been a closely fought contest between the two candidates - Prabowo Subianto, a former general, and Jakarta governor Joko Widodo, also known as Jokowi. The race is said to be too close to call and we will only know the final result in the third week of July. But whoever wins will face challenges that are easier to define than to confront and overcome.\n\nThroughout its modern history, Indonesia has repeatedly shown great economic promise and potential, and still does. But oftentimes, its progress has been held back by problems of political uncertainty and governance. Under the outgoing administration of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Indonesia made steady macroeconomic gains and once again emerged from the shadows to be heralded as a key Asian emerging market. Credit rating agency Standard & Poor's (S&P) said in a note yesterday that while Indonesia's sovereign credit quality improved steadily under the 10-year presidency of Dr Yudhoyono, due to political and macroeconomic stability, his administration has had less microeconomic success. The country's infrastructure remains creaky, its investment climate - particularly for foreign investors - remains lukewarm at best and bureaucratic red tape and corruption remain entrenched. It is in dealing with these big-picture issues that the new president must make his presence felt.\n\nUnfortunately, a closely fought presidential race means that the winner will probably emerge with only a small margin of victory, which may not be enough to give him the mandate, or confidence, to pursue bold reforms. Even so, he can send some positive signals early in his presidency. In particular, while nationalism, protectionism and populism with a tinge of anti-foreign investment sentiment may have been expedient during the election campaign, more pragmatism will be needed when it comes to framing actual policies. The new president must explicitly recognise the reality that foreign investment is indispensable if Indonesia is to upgrade its infrastructure and modernise its industry as well as service sectors. The process of opening up may have to be managed carefully; coalitions that support it must be nurtured and encouraged and vested interests resisted. This can take time.

Respondents, aged 18 to 65 in 14 countries were surveyed to uncover how full-time working professionals viewed relationships at work.\n\nWhile more than half the professionals here (51.5 per cent) said friendships with colleagues made them happier at work, more than one in five (20.4 per cent) said these friendships actually made them more competitive.\n\nBut even with their competitive streak, 60.9 per cent of Singapore workers said that they had a colleague who looked out for them - significantly above the global average of 48.5 per cent.\n\nAs for generational differences, millennials - more than any other age group - reported that friendships in the workplace affected them positively, making them feel happy (67.7 per cent) and productive (39.8 per cent).\n\nIn contrast, their older colleagues - baby boomers aged 55 to 65 - were far more likely (42.9 per cent) to report that their work performance was unaffected by friendships with colleagues.\n\nAmong millenials, the figure was only 14 per cent.\n\nThe survey also found that younger workers tended to draw fewer boundaries between their personal lives and the office. In fact, millennials were far more likely to discuss their salaries with co-workers (40.9 per cent) than the baby boomers (18.4 per cent).\n\nSuch blurring of their personal and professional lives extended online as well: nearly half of those aged 18 to 34 (49 per cent) had connected with their managers on a social media platform. For Singapore workers as a whole, it was 38.6 per cent.\n\nLinkedIn is the world's largest professional network. It has more than a million members here.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They have been unlucky at the World Cup, making it to the finals thrice - in 1974, 1978, and at the last World Cup in 2010 - only to trip at the final hurdle each time.\n\nOne problem the squad have had in the last three decades has been internal discord, with several instances of players pulling out of the World Cup at the last minute, bickering among themselves and with their managers.\n\nThe current squad, however, are united.\n\nIn Louis van Gaal, they have one of the most decorated and tactically astute among club coaches. His being a disciplinarian has helped him keep the egos in the Dutch dressing room in check. With discipline not an issue, he has managed to get the best out of his players so far, notably his front men van Persie and Robben.\n\nArgentina pose a great threat in attack, especially with Aguero returning from injury. In midfield, the team will miss the under-rated Angel Di Maria, who has been ruled out through injury, but one positive for them is that Higuain is finally making his presence felt more on the field, as evident in his match-winning performance against Belgium in the last round.\n\nThere can be no denying that the team's fate in the tournament hinges heavily on Messi, who has been largely responsible for their march to the semi-finals thus far, scoring some memorable goals en route. Even when he is not scoring, he has been central to the team's fortunes, as his dribbling run which set up Higuain for the winner on Sunday proved.\n\nHolland's hardman Nigel de Jong, back from suspension, is likely to be given the job of shackling Messi - a challenge he will throw every inch of himself into. Arguably, if Messi is muscled out, Argentina may find it difficult to break down the Dutch.\n\nBut Messi is a magician who needs only one moment to produce something spectacular. So expect him to still make some form of telling contribution to the game.\n\nHolland's answer to Messi is Robben - the speedy, skilful and tricky forward who could be too much for the Argentine defence to handle. The slow and adventurous Argentine defence can get caught out by quick attacks, as Nigeria showed in this tournament; Iran and Switzerland also came close to punishing the South Americans for lapses in defence.\n\nBut it is Sneijder who could prove to be the Dutch's greatest threat. After a relatively quiet start to the tournament, the playmaker has been peaking. He saved the Dutch from an early exit at the hands of Mexico in the second round; the woodwork was the only thing that stood in the way - twice - of his adding to his goal tally in the match against Costa Rica.\n\nBeyond individual flair and skill, I believe that the Dutch brand of Total Football and playing as a unit will make a difference in this match. Built on this strategy, Holland become extremely dangerous on the attack, as their wing-backs provide width, retain possession and have greater defensive cover from their midfielders when they are under attack. This could frustrate Argentina, who will have to lean on some Messi brilliance to make headway.\n\nIn this thrilling end-to-end game, expect Holland to edge out Argentina 2-1. Extra time may be in order to seal victory.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It also must have significant capital that provides a buffer when the markets are down,\" said Mr Tharman.\n\nHe said that while the government expected GIC to earn returns higher than what it paid on the SSGS, there was no assurance that GIC's returns would exceed SSGS interest rates over shorter periods, much less each year.\n\nGIC has earned a \"creditable return\" over the long term - 6.5 per cent per year over the last 20 years in US dollar terms, which translates to 5 per cent a year in Singapore dollar terms. But Mr Tharman said this masked \"wide fluctuations\" in returns from year to year.\n\nIn the five years following the global financial crisis until March last year, GIC managed a return of only 2.6 per cent in US dollar terms, which translated to 0.5 per cent in Singapore dollars.\n\nIn years when the markets are weak and GIC's returns fall below what the government has to pay on its special bonds, the government has a \"substantial buffer\" of net assets that enable it to meet its obligations, he said.\n\n\"The net assets have helped absorb any losses and ensured that the government can meet its obligations on the SSGS as well as its market-traded SGS (Singapore Government Securities). Correspondingly, when investment returns are strong, the net assets grow.\"\n\nMr Tharman also went into detail about how CPF monies are invested, and the wider role that GIC plays as the government's fund manager.\n\nThe CPF Board invests these funds in the SSGS, which are specially issued by the government to the CPF. The payout from the SSGS is pegged to the interest rates that CPF is committed to pay its members.\n\nThe government guarantees these SSGS bonds, said Mr Tharman, which means that CPF faces \"no risk\" of being unable to meet its obligations to its members.\n\n\"This is a solid guarantee, from a triple-A credit-rated government,\" he said. \"(This rating) reflects Singapore's very strong financial position, with the government's assets comfortably exceeding its liabilities.\"\n\nThe proceeds from SSGS issuance are pooled with the rest of the government's funds, such as the proceeds from other government securities and land sales, he said.\n\nThis combined pool is first deposited with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) as government deposits, with MAS later converting these funds into foreign assets through the foreign exchange market.\n\nA large portion of these assets are of a longer-term nature and these are transferred over to be managed by GIC.\n\n\"What these investment arrangements mean is that CPF members bear no investment risk at all in their CPF balances. Their monies are safe, and the returns they have been promised are guaranteed,\" said Mr Tharman.\n\nHe also clarified that SSGS proceeds were not passed to Temasek Holdings for management, as Temasek managed its own assets and does not touch any CPF monies.\n\nWhen asked why GIC does not manage CPF monies as an independent pool, he replied that this would mean GIC would need a \"very conservative\" portfolio that would not earn very much.\n\nIn his speech, Mr Tharman made the point that Singapore's CPF system was a sustainable one, so long as the government continued to run prudent budgets and invest the country's reserves wisely.\n\n\"Then, the government's balance sheet will remain strong and investment returns over the long term can continue to meet our debt costs,\" he said.\n\nLook up\n\nhttp://btd.sg/cpf-how-it-works\n\nfor graphic on 'CPF: How it works'\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/transport-logistics/united-delta-change-reward-programmes", "site_title": "United, Delta change reward programmes", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nUnited, Delta change reward programmes\n\nFrom 2015, points to be based on dollars spent, not distance\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Jul 8, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[NEW YORK] For airline passengers, rewards programmes may not seem so rewarding any more.\n\nTwo of the nation's largest airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, have announced that next year, frequent flyer points will be based on dollars spent on plane tickets rather than distance flown. And while another major carrier, American Airlines, has not announced any change, it is \"watching the competitive environment\", said Laura Nedbal, a spokeswoman.\n\nLeisure travellers may feel as though they are on the losing side of the changes. Every policy change has winners and losers, and airlines maintain that they are simply catering to customers who generate the most profit.\n\n\"These changes are designed to more directly recognise the value of our members when they fly United,\" said Thomas O'Toole, United's senior vice-president of marketing and loyalty and president of its MileagePlus programme. A Delta spokesman, Anthony Black, said that the company's surveys of customers showed \"they understood the change and believed it was fair to reward customers based on spending\".\n\nTim Winship, who has been following rewards programmes since 1997 as editor and publisher of FrequentFlier.com, said: \"The airlines want customers who fly often and buy higher-priced tickets to be happy.\"\n\nWhether or not travellers benefit from the new rules depends on the length of flight, their status with the airline and how much they pay for the ticket. Passengers on United or Delta without premier status receive five points per dollar spent, while higher-status flyer may have their ticket prices multiplied by up to 11 in the new system.\n\nMany travellers will be in for a surprise when they see how much their rewards are likely to decrease.\n\nFor example, Delta's online comparison tool shows that a US$500 round-trip flight between New York and Los Angeles would earn almost 5,000 miles now, but 2,500 miles once the new programme begins. Even Delta's highest-level flyers, those with Diamond Medallion status, would earn 5,500 points in the new programme for that ticket, compared with almost 11,000 in the current system.\n\nTo benefit under the new programme, a traveller will need to spend more on that flight - around US$1,000, according to the comparison tool. For the passenger who scrimps and saves, it's a new equation.\n\nMatt McDonough, who works for a TV network in New York and has been flying to Los Angeles or Atlanta every two to three weeks, says he is resigned to earning fewer miles. \"Buying a more expensive ticket will earn more miles,\" he said, \"but my goal is still to buy the cheapest plane ticket I can, whether I am paying for it or my company is.\"\n\nPremier travellers buying expensive tickets on short-haul flights will earn more points in the new system. A US$500 round-trip flight between Philadelphia and Indianapolis would net a Diamond Medallion flyer 2,641 points in the current system and 5,500 in the new system.\n\nUnited also offers a way to see how many points would be earned by ticket price but does not compare it with the current award, which has left some of its frequent business travellers unhappy.\n\nMichael Heuser of Herndon, Virginia, travels often in business class to Europe. \"I think I am a high-value customer, but they haven't communicated how this will help me,\" he said of United.\n\nOverall, Mr McDonough says he is finding less value in the frequent flyer system these days. He adds his name to the upgrade lists at the gate, but says that he had been upgraded to business class only once in the past four years. \"I really fly a lot, but there always seem to be customers who fly even more or spend more on their airline credit cards,\" he said.\n\nMr McDonough says that he was happy to get the miles he does, but \"if my company wasn't flying me across the country, I wouldn't bother with the programmes because it would take forever to get enough points to make it worth it\".\n\nAirlines point out that there are many ways other than buying plane tickets to accumulate points. American, for example, has more than 1,000 partners in its AAdvantage programme, including a credit card, hotels and car rental companies. In 2012, American sold 66 per cent of the 209 billion miles it awarded to frequent flyers that year to partners such as Citibank, Starwood and Avis.\n\nBut those partnerships only add to the complexity, which in itself is becoming one reason some travellers are deciding it is not worth the effort. Summer Hull, who runs mommypoints.com, keeps readers up to date with changes daily.

TSR for the previous year was 8.86 per cent.\n\nIn US dollar terms, the one-year total shareholder return was zero per cent.\n\nIts three-year TSR was 3.89 per cent, five-year TSR was 10.86 per cent and 9 per cent on a 10-year basis. Twenty-year TSR was 6 per cent, and TSR since inception in 1974 was 16 per cent.\n\nTemasek's own measurement of performance to beat is 8 per cent which is also its cost of capital.\n\nRealistically, one-year returns are volatile, said Rohit Sipahimalani, Temasek co-head, investment group, at yesterday's press briefing. Its performance over the medium to long term - 5 and 10 years - \"has been respectable\", he said.\n\n\"We are conscious of the return hurdle of 8 per cent and investing with a view to exceed that,\" he said.\n\nAbout half of Temasek's companies are listed in Singapore and Hong Kong and these markets showed negative returns last year, said Mr Sipahimalani. Some of these markets over the last quarter has recovered and returned over 4-5 per cent, he noted.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 19 per cent in the year ended March while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 14 per cent, outpacing the 1.8 per cent return for the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. The Straits Times Index fell 3.6 per cent in the year.\n\nTemasek's portfolio rose 3.7 per cent to $223 billion, from $215 billion the year before. It received a $5 billion shareholder capital injection during the year.\n\nIn its most active year of investments since the Global Financial Crisis, Temasek made $24 billion in new investments for the period, while divesting $10 billion.\n\n\"This year has been one of our most active for new investments - the most active since the Global Financial Crisis - driven by softer Asian markets of interest, as well as the continued recovery of the global economy,\" said Temasek chairman Lim Boon Heng.\n\nThe group's net profit was $10.9 billion for the year, up from $10.6 billion previously. On its investments during the year, the top three sectors were financial services, life sciences and energy. Towards the end of the year, it stepped up investment activity in the consumer sector.\n\nTemasek completed its US$5.7 billion purchase of a 24.95 per cent stake in AS Watson from Hutchison Whampoa in April this year.\n\nThis is one of its largest single transactions, increasing Temasek's exposure to the consumer sector, especially to a growing Asia and a recovering Europe.\n\nWhile financial services remain Temasek's single largest sector at 30 per cent of total portfolio, life sciences, consumer and real estate rose to 14 per cent from 12 per cent.\n\nIt will be larger if Watson and Olam are included. In March this year, wholly owned subsidiary, Breedens Investments, made an offer for Olam, an integrated supply chain manager and processor of agricultural products and food ingredients. The offer closed in May, and the stake in the company increased to 58.5 per cent.\n\nIn the financial services sector, Temasek raised its stake in AIA, the largest independent pan-Asia insurer, to over 3.5 per cent, and increased its holdings in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China to 8.9 per cent of its outstanding H-shares.\n\nIt also acquired about 1.1 per cent of Lloyds Banking Group, the largest domestic UK bank by assets, with leading market shares in mortgage and deposits.\n\nOpportunities in the life sciences sector included an investment of almost US$1 billion in Gilead Sciences, a major developer of treatments for cancer, HIV and other diseases; and US$500 million in Thermo Fisher Scientific, a provider of laboratory equipment and consumables.\n\nIn the energy space, Temasek invested \u00a3235 million (S$500.2 million) in the BG Group, a UK-listed oil and gas company. It also invested about $2 billion in Pavilion Energy, which purchased a 20 per cent interest in three gas concession blocks in Tanzania from Ophir Energy. Post March transactions included a US$150 million commitment to Seven Energy in Nigeria, an indigenous oil and gas producer.\n\nThe company remains confident in China despite slowing growth and the worrying shadow banking activity, said Wu Yibing, Temasek head, China. He does not expect a hard landing in China while the country transits to slower and stable growth.\n\nTemasek continues to see many opportunities in Chinese financial institutions and the country's regulators have \"ample policy tools to manage this through\", he said.\n\nGeographically, China makes up its second largest exposure at 25 per cent of portfolio, up from 23 per cent, after Singapore which rose to 31 per cent from 30 per cent. Australia is third with 10 per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth/wealth-investing/foreign-investors-bullish-indian-shares-pay-premium", "site_title": "Foreign investors bullish on Indian shares, pay premium", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nForeign investors bullish on Indian shares, pay premium\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Jul 8, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[MUMBAI] International demand for Indian equities is so strong that foreign-ownership limits have been breached at 17 of the biggest listed companies, and the premium paid for those shares is surging.\n\nThe bullishness has prompted Indian companies such as Bharti Airtel Ltd, the nation's largest mobile-phone carrier, and Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd, a Mumbai-based broadcaster, to raise investment caps.\n\nHDFC Bank Ltd, India's biggest bank by market value, and state-run Coal India Ltd also plan to take advantage of foreign interest by selling stakes, part of a flood of share sales that CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets estimates will reach US$50 billion in the next 24 months.\n\n\"Companies that increase foreign limits will be treated positively,\" said Mark Mobius, who oversees more than US$40 billion as the executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets Group in Singapore. \"It shows they are open to foreign investment and are willing to adhere to better corporate governance norms.\"\n\nWithout new supply, international investors are hitting a wall in India as their confidence grows in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ability to revive economic growth after sweeping to power in May in the nation's largest election victory in three decades. Mr Modi's administration will unveil its first federal budget tomorrow.\n\nThe 20-day average price gap for shares in the market's foreign segment, where overseas investors trade when holdings reach the limit, versus those available to domestic investors was 2 per cent as at Monday, the highest level since January 2013, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Acquiring a stake in HDFC Bank costs an international investor 4.4 per cent more than a local buyer.\n\nForeign demand helped push up the S&P BSE Sensex index 14 per cent last quarter, the biggest gain in more than four years, and 23 per cent so far in 2014. International investors bought a net US$10.7 billion of the nation's shares this year, the most among eight Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg after Taiwan.\n\nAt least seven Indian firms have already moved to take advantage of foreign inflows by raising their caps. Those that did advanced an average 13 per cent in Mumbai within the following month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bharti added 0.7 per cent on July 4 after the Reserve Bank of India allowed the company to raise its foreign investment limit to 74 per cent.\n\nWhile India's non-bank companies can set their own limits, the central bank restricts foreign stakes in lenders to 49 per cent. That enables the government to maintain influence over local companies deemed strategic to the economy, said Jan Dehn, the London-based head of research at Ashmore Group plc.\n\nIndia, home to Asia's fourth biggest stock market, is not the only nation where foreign stakes are running up against limits. In Vietnam, at least 20 companies had holdings at the nation's 49 per cent ceiling at the end of last year, with investors from Templeton to Dragon Capital Group Ltd saying that they have been unable to buy as many shares as they want. China has a 30 per cent cap on foreign holdings in mainland-listed shares.\n\nThe May 16 victory for 63-year-old Mr Modi, who oversaw annual economic growth of 10 per cent in India's Gujarat state since 2001, has fuelled speculation that he will replicate that success at the national level. Under former prime minister Manmohan Singh's Congress party, the growth rate fell to a decade-low of 4.5 per cent in the year ended March 2013.\n\nRising valuations have made it difficult to find large-capitalisation stocks trading at attractive prices in India, said Arnout van Rijn, an Asia-Pacific equities fund manager at Robeco Hong Kong Ltd, which oversees about US$290 billion. The Sensex has a multiple of 15.9 times estimated profit for the next 12 months, the highest level since January 2011 and a 43 per cent premium over the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nHDFC Bank is valued at 4.6 times net assets, versus a ratio of 2.1 for the S&P BSE India Bankex index. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the New Delhi-based carmaker whose foreign holdings are close to the 24 per cent limit, trades at 22 times estimated profits, a 60 per cent premium versus global peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\"Foreign investors are so exposed in India that they'll probably take profits,\" Mr van Rijn said in a June 26 interview in Hong Kong.\n\nOverseas money managers' favourite stocks have delivered market-beating gains over the long term. The average annualised return for 16 shares in the foreign segment with at least five years of trading history was about 29 per cent, versus 15 per cent for the Sensex, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nMumbai-based HDFC Bank has reported profit growth greater than 20 per cent every year since 1998, and analysts predict that the firm will maintain that pace till at least March 2017, according to projections compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nMr Modi's economic policies will probably lead to higher corporate earnings and fewer bad loans at lenders, Ajay Argal, the head of Indian Equities at Baring Asset Management Asia Ltd, said in a briefing in London on June 26.\n\n\"Foreign investors are bullish on the growth potential of these companies on anticipation they will benefit from the new government's reform measures,\" Supreeth Shankarghal, the chief executive officer at Quant First Asset Advisors India Ltd in Bangalore, which manages about US$100 million in options, said in an interview on June 30.\n\nHDFC Bank is among companies that may tap into growing foreign demand for its stock. Shareholders have approved raising as much as 100 billion rupees (S$2 billion) over the next year, Aditya Puri, a managing director at the lender, said at an annual general meeting in Mumbai on June 25. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom: survey\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

The Indian electorate is impatient for change and investors are expecting it: India's stockmarket indices have jumped more than 20 per cent this year in anticipation of pro-growth reforms. If it is to meet these expectations, Mr Jaitley's Budget will need to at once spell out a vision for transformation and a set of policies to get the process going.\n\nOne of his key priorities should be to chart out a credible roadmap to bring down India's fiscal deficit, which is running at close to 5 per cent of GDP, against a target of 4.1 per cent. He will face constraints here. On the expenditure side, there are mega-plans to expand infrastructure spending in all areas and social spending is hard to cut - if anything it should be increased, especially in areas such as health and education. However, there is scope to reduce some subsidies - for example, on energy. But there are big opportunities on the revenue side.\n\nOne lies in privatisation. The government has reportedly targeted US$11.6 billion in asset sales - which would be almost equal to the proceeds of the last four years. There is ample scope for stake sales in Indian public sector enterprises - even without relinquishing majority control - in areas including coal, steel and power.\n\nIn banking, an expert panel has recommended that the government reduce its stakes in state-owned banks to below 51 per cent. This would be a significant move that would at least partially obviate the need for the government to recapitalise many of these banks, which it would otherwise need to do. A bold privatisation programme makes particular sense at this time given that India's stock markets are buoyant, which would make for relatively high valuations and therefore high receipts.\n\nAnother key measure on the revenue side would be to accelerate the adoption of the goods and services tax (GST) which would broaden India's narrow tax base. While this cannot be implemented immediately as it requires the cooperation of state governments, a clear timetable would create some confidence in India's medium- term fiscal outlook.\n\nBoosting foreign investor sentiment must also be high on the agenda. One must-have is the removal of retroactive taxation policies introduced by the last government. Relaxing foreign direct investment (FDI) norms is another. The defence sector, railways, e-commerce, multi- brand retail and, in particular, insurance are areas where there is much scope for raising FDI equity caps.\n\nMr Jaitley's first Budget will set the tone for the Modi government's transformational economic agenda. The Budget must be bold enough to do it justice.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The traveller may also undergo additional screening.\" The agency noted that it could \"adjust\" security measures further to provide maximum security to travellers.\n\nA TSA official declined to confirm further details about the enhanced screenings in the United States, and on US-bound flights.\n\nFrench and British authorities have urged passengers to allow extra time to get past the additional measures, which were not specified but were believed to focus on footwear and electronic items.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, of which the TSA is part, is also asking that airlines and airport authorities in Europe and elsewhere examine the shoes of passengers headed for the United States and increase random screenings of travellers, ABC News reported.\n\nIt cited one source as saying that the unspecified threat was \"different and more disturbing than past aviation plots\". \"We felt that it was important to crank it up some at the last point-of-departure airports,\" DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson told NBC television's Meet the Press. \"And we'll continually evaluate the situation.\n\n\"We know that there remains a terrorist threat to the United States. And aviation security is a large part of that,\" he added.\n\nLast Wednesday, US officials had publicly demanded enhanced security for airports in Europe and the Middle East with direct US flights to the United States.\n\nThey did not confirm whether they had intelligence about a specific plot, but their actions suggested alarm.\n\nThe request was \"based on real-time intelligence\", according to a Homeland Security Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nWestern intelligence services say that hundreds of militants travelling from Europe to fight in the Middle East could pose a security risk on their return. Most European passport holders do not need a visa to travel to the United States.\n\nOf particular concern is Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), the Yemen-based branch of the terror network founded by the late Osama bin Laden.\n\nUS and other intelligence services say that AQAP is passing on sophisticated bombmaking expertise to militants fighting in Syria for use against Western targets - most prominently, passenger aircraft.\n\nAQAP \"is always the group we think about when we talk about undetectable bombs\", a US intelligence official told AFP on Friday.\n\nFrance announced that it was boosting passenger screening at its airports, responding to a request from Washington.\n\nThe French move follows similar action already implemented by Britain, and notably impacts Europe's two busiest hubs, Heathrow and Charles de Gaulle.\n\nPassengers in Britain have long faced tight security measures at airports following high-profile threats, including a failed attempt by British \"shoe bomber\" Richard Reid to blow up a US-bound flight in 2001.\n\nExperts say that if anyone could be behind the threat of a new generation of bombs, it was Ibrahim al-Asiri, a 32-year-old Saudi believed to be hiding out with AQAP in Yemen's restive southern provinces.\n\nA previous high-profile attempt by AQAP to blow up a US-bound plane failed on Dec 25, 2009, when Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab tried to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear.\n\nThe Detroit \"underwear bomber\" is now serving a life sentence in the United States. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/413f81d313e3a80b10d6a9af307c9609e636c7bfb577a89404b6ec5b377d7bb2?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Air travellers with smartphones or other electronic devices must be able to turn them on to take them aboard under new security measures - PHOTO: REUTERS"}]}

That prompted authorities to double property transaction fees to 4 per cent last year and the United Arab Emirates' central bank to impose mortgage caps.\n\nThe buying and selling of off-plan properties for a quick profit, known as flipping, was seen as a major cause of the crash in 2008. Buyers usually put down a deposit of about 10 per cent on off-plan homes and make additional payments as construction progresses, with a final sum due when the property is delivered. At the height of the property bubble, contracts often changed hands before any construction took place.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Property\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

Alibaba's initial public offering, slated for next month, is shaping up to be one of the largest tech sector debuts in New York. It is seeking to raise US$20 billion, valuing the company at over US$200 billion, said a recent report by The Wall Street Journal quoting analysts.\n\nAsked whether Temasek had plans for its 18 per cent stake in Standard Chartered - one of the poorest performers in its portfolio companies - Mr Sipahimalani said it was not a fair question, as global banks have had a volatile year.\n\n\"We remain an active investor engaged in the company,\" he said.\n\nThe one-year return for the UK-listed StanChart was -22.9 per cent.\n\nRetail investors who have been hoping to invest alongside or in Temasek will have to wait some more.\n\nPek Siok Lan, Temasek's senior managing director and general counsel, said a bond issue would largely depend on Temasek's funding needs.\n\nShe added: \"We've been working on it (the bond issue) for a while ... in dialogue with regulators.\"\n\nRetail investors looking to invest in a Temasek fund will also have to be patient.\n\nAstrea II, a fund of funds launched in April, could be a platform for retail investors. It now invests in 36 private equity funds and has been offered only to institutional investors.\n\nTemasek is the single largest investor in Astrea II, with a 38 per cent stake.

However, there are concerns that the arrival of the A330neo could spark aggressive price competition for new orders.\n\nAirbus has said that the A330neo would have the same \"cash operating costs\" and cost much less to buy than the Boeing 787-9, Boeing's latest model due to make its debut at Farnborough.\n\nBoeing disputed these assertions as well as Airbus' forecasts of more than 1,000 potential sales for the A330neo.\n\nMr Lahoud said that he was optimistic about the overall outlook for aircraft deals at the Farnborough Airshow. Asked how many orders he expected, he said: \"We believe we'll have a good business dynamic . . . we are pretty confident.\"\n\nAirbus ended the first half of the year behind its US rival in orders and deliveries, but is widely expected to unveil hundreds of new orders in Farnborough. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM", "images": []}

You don't need to just depend on bank loans,\" said Mr Koh, who had chaired Singapore's largest companies such as SingTel, Singapore Airlines and DBS Bank. He is currently the managing partner of private equity firm Credence.\n\n\"Look at the stock exchanges around the world. There are thousands of companies, the majority of them are not followed, are not traded,\" he said. These small companies are saddled with the compliance costs of being publicly listed, Mr Koh said.\n\n\"The bankers are not going to tell you not to do it, because they earn their one-off transaction fees. But the companies are burdened. . . You don't have to IPO your business until you are large enough, until you have a following.\"\n\nMr Koh was speaking to The Business Times about his talk in Jakarta last Tuesday to the Young Entrepreneur Council, under the Chinese-Indonesian group Inti, or Perhimpunan Indonesia-Tionghoa. Those who attended his speech were the children of the first-generation founders of Indonesian businesses, big and small. The second generation were in their 20s to 40s.\n\nMr Koh was telling the second generation how the environment to grow a business has changed compared to a generation ago. A major change is how the workforce in the world has doubled from two billion to almost four billion today. Another change is the disruption that technology is wreaking across all businesses.\n\nA retailer in the past might know what a regular customer looked like and bought, but little else. A vendor selling goods across the Internet today might not recognise the customer but knows a lot more about his or her buying habits.\n\n\"If he notices that you buy golf balls, he'll be able to pitch to you all the apparel, all the shoes,\" Mr Koh said.\n\nThe industrial revolution happened more than a century ago and people are still making improvements to manufacturing processes today, he noted.\n\n\"The digital revolution has only been here for 25 to 30 years, we haven't even seen the most significant advances yet. I cannot imagine, sitting here, what the advances will be. I can only say they are going to be formidable.\"\n\nCredence, which Mr Koh and two other partners founded in 2006, invests in advanced manufacturing, infocommunications and technology companies in the region. Mr Koh said the environment for private equity is much more favourable now than three to five years ago. This is due to increasing acceptance of the benefits, he said. \"Here in Asia, the idea of sharing your company with an investor is a psychological hurdle,\" he said.\n\nPrivate equity firms typically take stakes in more established businesses, help them improve their operations and profitability, before exiting. Venture capital, by contrast, funds startups which have a high chance of failing.\n\nMr Koh is also a prominent angel investor. He has invested in startups such as hotel booking mobile application HotelQuickly and DocDoc, a doctor booking service. Asked about his thoughts on the global financial sector, Mr Koh said the recent US$9 billion settlement charge slapped on French bank BNP Paribas by US regulators did not go far enough.\n\nThe bank had covered up its conduct of business with countries that faced US sanctions such as Sudan and Iran. The sanctions were to prevent the funding of terrorists and criminals.\n\n\"You steal a bicycle anywhere in the world, you go to jail for it. But if you commit a crime known to several layers of the bank, and facilitate the demise of innocent people, you don't have to.\n\n\"You've got to send a message to the industry by sending the people responsible to jail,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This has directly resulted in the tightening of bid/ask spreads, which has provided better pricing opportunities and allowed physical participants to meet their hedging needs more efficiently.\n\n\"The SGX Sicom rubber futures are also being increasingly used as effective hedging tools by natural rubber producers (illustrated by the increase in market composition from 13 per cent to 16 per cent), as the futures contracts are physically settled via a well-established delivery process,\" it added.\n\nThe SGX Sicom rubber futures are denominated in US dollars, in line with physical trading practices. It said this eliminates the currency risk inherent in trading and hedging using other markets.\n\nWorldwide consumption for natural rubber has increased steadily in the recent decade and the Asian story continues to drive demand for the raw material.\n\nSGX offers two Sicom rubber futures - RSS3 and TSR20 - to provide market participants with a pricing basis as a point of reference for their physical cargo, and to manage price risks.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Without their main source of goals, Neymar - whose four goals account for nearly half the 11 goals the team has bagged in this tournament - scoring may be a greater challenge for Luiz Felipe Scolari's men.\n\nGermany are not perfect either. After starting the tournament with a bang, bagging a 4-0 win over Portugal, the German engine has stuttered. They secured a fortunate draw with Ghana, and then went on to labour to hard-fought wins over USA, Algeria and France. But that's Germany for you: even when their play lacks inspiration, they are able to grind out dogged wins. Tomorrow morning may not be any different.\n\nThe difference to Germany's look and feel this time round will lie in Joachim Loew's choice of players and formation for his team. During most of this campaign, he has played captain Philipp Lahm as a midfield anchor, instead of his usual full-back position, and Thomas Muller as a chief striker, moving away from the team's classic 4-2-3-1 formation to a 4-3-3.\n\nThis option has provided more defensive cover for Germany in the middle of the park, and allowed Toni Kroos more room to move forward and dictate play. Loew has also used centre-backs in his four-man defence, allowing the three forwards Mesut Ozil, Mario Gotze and Muller more room on the flanks and to play interchangeably. Loew may have to tinker with this tomorrow.\n\nIf Scolari fields the returning Luiz Gustavo instead of Oscar as a replacement for Neymar, Brazil could play a more aggressive, physical game, which means fans should not expect too many goals.\n\nIf the Germans revert to their 4-2-3-1 formation, they can push Lahm back to his full-back position, as they will not need him in midfield to keep Oscar in check. Instead, their wing-backs will provide more width to get around a compact Brazilian midfield.\n\nThe Germans will need the hardworking Bastian Schweinsteiger in midfield in this set-up, likely replacing Mesut Ozil, who has been largely wasteful and disappointing.\n\nGermany could also capitalise on Thiago Motta's absence from the heart of the Brazilian defence by catching out the adventurous David Luiz through quick attacks. For that though, they may need more speed in attack, and Loew may opt for Chelsea's Andre Schurrle instead of the experienced Miroslav Klose, who is tied on 15 goals with Brazilian great Ronaldo for the World Cup scoring record.\n\nThe Germans' key advantage in this physical encounter could be their towering heights, particularly when it comes to set-pieces. Both teams have scored a fair number of goals through corners and free-kicks, but with the Germans' height advantage in defence and attack, they are likely to be better able than the Brazilians to exploit the set-pieces.\n\nIn this scruffy affair, expect the Germans to score, likely through a set-piece, and then for them to fight it out for a 1-0 win. It looks like Germany will break millions of Brazilian hearts and march to the final.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Another saga is playing out in relation to a 1,000MW-1,4000MW combined-cycle power plant in the southern state of Johor, called Project 4A.\n\nThe project, awarded to a consortium comprising a firm controlled by the Johor Sultan and Tenaga, has been in limbo since teammate YTL Power bowed out after the project came under fire for being awarded through direct negotiations. On its part, Tenaga is under pressure from no less than its own union, to make a stand against projects awarded on closed tenders and to push instead for a more open and transparent system.\n\nThe move now to call on Tenaga to participate in strategic investment fund 1MDB's coal-fired power project could set off another backlash.\n\n\"Most of 1MDB's power assets are in Malaysia. So, it's akin to being the second national utility. It competes for projects with Tenaga and now, it wants Tenaga to also be a partner. Where is the strategy in that?\" asked an observer.\n\n1MDB, on its part, has been dogged by criticism since its inception in 2009 for its opaque investment decisions and peculiar choice of business partners.\n\nProject 3B is deemed a lifeline for the state-owned fund - most of its power assets are old with concessions nearing expiry - to court investor dollars for its upcoming mega initial public offering.\n\nWith over RM30 billion (S$11.7 billion) in debt, 1MDB is working hard with its appointed bankers to rush out its stock offering, slated for September this year and expected to raise up to US$3 billion.\n\n\"It needs to do the IPO yesterday,\" said a source, referring to the urgency for the fund to lighten its debt load.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They did not say whether they had intelligence about a specific plot, but their actions suggested alarm.\n\nThe request was \"based on real-time intelligence\", according to a US Homeland Security Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nLast Thursday, the US embassy in Uganda warned of a possible plot targeting Entebbe airport, that serves the capital Kampala, for later that day. But the danger period elapsed without incident.\n\nWestern intelligence services are concerned that hundreds of Islamist radicals travelling from Europe to fight in the Middle East could pose a security risk on their return. Most European passport-holders do not need a visa to travel to the United States.\n\nOne of the radical organisations, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), is of particular concern.\n\nUS and other intelligence services believe that AQAP is passing on sophisticated bomb-making expertise to militants fighting in Syria for use against Western targets - most prominently, passenger aircraft.\n\n\"We have long-standing concern about terrorist groups trying to get undetected material onto planes,\" a US intelligence official told AFP.\n\nAQAP \"is always the group we think about when we talk about undetectable bombs\", the official added.\n\nBrooke Rogers, of the War Studies Department at King's College London, said that for extremist groups, bringing down an aircraft was the \"ultimate prize\", adding: \"If the attackers succeed, it will be spectacular for them.\"\n\nAnd \"unfortunately in aviation, it doesn't take a big amount (of explosives) to make a boom,\" said US air security expert Jeff Price.\n\nFrance's aviation authorities said in a statement that its new security measures \"will be carried out in a way to limit as much as possible inconvenience to passengers\". \"However, delays are possible,\" it added.\n\nThe stepped-up screening is taking place at Charles de Gaulle airport - which has 47 US-bound flights a day at this time of the year - and other airports in mainland France, as well as in far-flung French territories such as Tahiti.\n\nA spokesman for the DGAC civil aviation authority told AFP that \"we cannot divulge the added measures\" being taken.\n\nHowever, Belgian Interior Minister Joelle Milquet, whose country is also stepping up airport security, told RTL-TVI last Thursday that the measures would focus on electronic equipment such as tablets, computers and mobile phones \"to make sure there are no explosives\".\n\nBritain downplayed the extra delays that passengers would face, with Prime Minister David Cameron saying: \"The safety of the travelling public must come first - we mustn't take any risks.\" His office said that there was an \"evolving threat\" but declined to provide further details.\n\nAlthough it implemented the additional security from Thursday, Britain was keeping its international terror threat level unchanged at substantial, the third highest grade out of five, where it has been since July 2011.\n\nPassengers in Britain have long faced tight security measures at airports following high-profile threats, including a failed attempt by British \"shoe bomber\" Richard Reid to blow up a US-bound flight in 2001.\n\nExperts said that if anyone could be behind the threat of a new generation of bombs, it was Ibrahim al-Asiri, a 32-year-old Saudi believed to be hiding out with AQAP in Yemen's restive southern provinces.\n\nThe terror alert in Uganda further rattled nerves, but it was not immediately clear if it was linked to the airport security boost.\n\nAirport security across the world was greatly reinforced in the wake of the Sept 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.\n\nIt was further tightened after the shoe-bomber plot, and when another attempt to blow up \"liquid bombs\" on transatlantic flights was uncovered in 2006.\n\nA previous high-profile attempt by AQAP to blow up a US-bound plane failed on December 25, 2009, when Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab tried to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/87137d6a50ca54fa3512ddb4dc06ba524a9c32b066bd0e0df8406d13cca9d4bc?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Keeping watch: France has responded to a request from Washington for extra security for US-bound flights over fears that Islamist radicals could be plotting new attacks. - PHOTO: REUTERS"}]}

If you run too many new routes where the ridership is low, then subsidies will, of course, have to go up.\"\n\nIncreased frequency of bus services also translates to higher operating costs, which would require bigger subsidies to be paid out to public transport operators. \"So we again have to be quite judicious when we raise service standards to make sure that we do not overstep and ultimately result in a much bigger bill in terms of the subsidies we have to pay,\" Mr Lui highlighted.\n\nWhat's moving the markets?

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/why-over-insuring-not-assuring", "site_title": "Why over-insuring is not that assuring", "publish_date": null, "content": "Why over-insuring is not that assuring\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jul 4, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nMUCH has been said about the strengths and weaknesses of the long-awaited recommendations crafted by the MediShield Life Review Committee, but one issue has stuck out like a sore thumb: the overbuying of Integrated Shield Plans (IPs).\n\nIn the clearest indication that something is amiss, the committee's report released last Friday stated that about three in five Singaporeans covered under MediShield purchased IPs.\n\nNothing wrong there. After all, it is the consumer's perogative to have higher healthcare assurance. But seven in 10 armed with IPs that target Class A wards in public hospitals chose to stay in lower ward classes when hospitalised. Only one in 10 from the same group chose private hospitals.\n\nEchoing a similar trend were those with IPs that target private hospitals - six in 10 chose lower ward classes in public hospitals. The committee noted twice in its report that many Singaporeans want medical treatment beyond that provided in Class B2/C wards but have \"over-stretched themselves to buy the most expensive product for higher protection\".\n\nHaving said that, it qualified that this typically happens during the working years, when premiums can be paid entirely or mostly through Medisave, the national medical savings scheme used to foot hospital bills, among other things.\n\nA quick comparison of the IPs offered by the five insurers - AIA, Prudential, Aviva, NTUC Income and Great Eastern - showed that premiums for the first 40 years of an individual's life were priced suitably low to gain market share.\n\nFor example, existing private IPs for Class B1 in public hospitals range between $78 and $207 annually, according to the comparison provided by the Ministry of Health's website. The amount payable doubles to about $297 to $410 when the consumer is between the age of 41 and 50. It rises to between $425 and $921 for those aged 51 to 65, and for those who are 66 to 90, the yearly costs go up to between $888 and $4,245.\n\nWhile information is relatively accessible and most people understand that they have to pay more as they get older, only a small number of people truly realise the exponential spike in IP premiums from age 60 onwards, not to mention the accumulated lifetime costs.\n\nAll these point towards a poor comprehension of the workings of IPs - a point that the committee also made sure to reiterate throughout its report. This is why there is a pressing need for the government to educate the wider public of its entire healthcare financing system, as well as the things to look out for in choosing an IP if required, so that the individual can make an informed decision.\n\nThe knee-jerk reaction to the introduction of MediShield Life is to drop the existing IP, but hold your horses.\n\nTypically, the existing IPs should provide enough coverage. The Life Insurance Association Singapore has assured policyholders that \"there will be minimal impact on the top-up portion of policyholders' IPs\".\n\nSteven Lim, health insurance consulting and actuary partner at PwC Singapore, cautioned that the individual should compare apples to apples. \"Basically, most people will be weighing the increase in the premium price against the increase in level of coverage, and also looking at other secondary factors such as the insurer's reputation and the level of service by the insurance agent.\n\n\"However, lower income earners, who currently have a Shield Plan for which the increase in premium is significant, will now have to make a choice on whether they can afford to continue with an IP.\"\n\nIn a similar vein, MOH advised the public to factor in their \"preferred ward class\" and \"the affordability of premiums over the long term\".\n\nWoo Shea Leen, financial services insurance partner of PwC Singapore, said that the uncertainty surrounding IPs in terms of pricing, coverage and the treatment of pre-existing conditions is the single biggest challenge that consumers now face. \"There has been some effort from MOH to address this by way of FAQs on their website, but more can be done by private insurers to inform and educate their customers on how exactly the rollout of MediShield Life and IPs will affect them.\"\n\nHonestly, besides educating the consumer, perhaps the same can be done for those promoting the IPs. After all, the committee did urge the authorities to improve the existing regulatory framework by setting \"clearer guidelines and rules\". It also pushed for \"reader-friendly\" information to be disseminated and \"responsible selling requirements\".\n\nFor now, consumers may feel assured that the proposed changes make sense and are necessary to plug the gaps in our healthcare system. But as medical inflation and claims limits balloon, the path to universal health care is undoubtedly uphill.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

If news reports are accurate, there will soon be new legislation to curb the phenomenon of \"thin capitalisation\" - whereby MNCs borrow at high interest in high-tax jurisdictions and lend at zero interest to their own entities located in tax havens, for the sole purpose of minimising, or avoiding, local taxes.\n\nThe immediate trigger to act on this issue was an expose in a leading Sydney newspaper which lifted the cloak of secrecy surrounding the tax affairs of Glencore, the biggest miner and exporter of thermal coal in Australia. The report revealed that on A$15 billion (S$17.5 billion) of income in the last three years, Glencore's Australian branch had paid almost no tax.\n\nThe company is no stranger to this sort of controversy. In 2011, one of Africa's poorest countries, Zambia, accused MNC miners of avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes through tactics such as transfer pricing. In an audit by tax consultancies Grant Thornton and Econ Poyry, Glencore was found to have manipulated the tax system to its sole advantage. The audit found that the mining company, Mopani, 76 per cent owned by Glencore, used its relationship with the parent company to carry out practices such as inflating operational costs, underpricing the output of its mines, irregular hedging and transfer pricing.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We don't have many restaurants and banquet facilities like in four and five-star hotels. Many restaurants and F&B businesses in hotels have been very negatively affected because of the crackdown, which directly affects the profitability of hotels too.\n\n\"We also understand that when government officials travel, they can't stay in star-rated hotels, so the occupancies at four and five-star-rated hotels have been affected . . . It is a good thing for our serviced apartments that we don't have star ratings, so we are not affected by the crackdown.\"\n\nThe Reit has been actively acquiring assets in Asia-Pacific and Europe. When asked if it has plans to expand into the United States, the chairman of the Reit manager, Lim Jit Poh, cited the country's distance from Singapore and its \"very high\" taxes as factors that hold them back from making the leap.\n\nReal estate income is subject to a 30-per cent withholding tax, on top of the usual state and federal taxes in the US.\n\n\"The US is within our radar screen, but so far, opportunities are not there yet . . . We will buy if there is some reason for us and our shareholders. We will not rush just for the sake of having that (piece of) jigsaw puzzle,\" he said.\n\nMr Tay added that any acquisition would unlikely be just a single property; it would not be able to justify the manpower and management time needed to manage the property. \"What will be more interesting for us is a platform to enter in a bigger way, a merger and acquisition kind of opportunity. That is something that we will be keen to look at,\" he said.\n\nIts sponsor, The Ascott, has no footprint in the US yet either.\n\nLee Chee Koon, The Ascott's CEO, told reporters later: \"We are considering the US, (but) if it's in the US, it has to be a portfolio, it won't be just one property.

He told a conference yesterday: \"I think further correction would not be unexpected.\"\n\nHe told a conference that Singapore had responded early enough to raging property prices with a set of cooling measures, but added that a crash in the property market was unlikely.\n\nOn the subject of keeping track of the market, he called for more emphasis on monitoring banks. \"I don't want to quarrel with the Basel recommendations. They are basically in the right direction; they are good for the long term.\n\n\"But far more focus needs to be placed on supervising banks and other financial institutions in the midst of the game, not just setting the rules of the game before it starts,\" he said. \"You need a good umpire, you need a good linesman.\"\n\nLast week, it was announced that Singapore would identify and regulate certain banks essentially deemed \"too big to fail\". Such lenders, to be known as domestic systemically important banks, would have to meet Singapore's prescribed liquidity coverage ratio, which seeks to ensure that these banks hold enough high-quality liquid assets to cover short-term market shocks. \"The larger the bank is, and the more international it is, the more intrusive your supervision has to be,\" said Mr Tharman.\n\nAs a result of greater banking regulation, which has meant higher capital requirements, growth may slow.\n\n\"It does mean that it weakens the ability of the banking systems to stimulate growth,\" said Mr Tharman, adding that rules around crisis management of banks need to be outlined, too.\n\n\"Otherwise, I fear that we keep adding to regulatory requirements, some of which are already having negative impact, including in emerging economies.\"\n\nMr Tharman invited laughter from the crowd, as he turned his attention to the subject of service expectations. \"If you go into a top hotel in Stockholm, sit down and have breakfast, you don't call someone for your coffee, because you've got a rather nice flask right in front of you - and you pour it yourself. Is it difficult?\"\n\nHere, a Singaporean is likely to look around for someone to serve the coffee. He said: \"We must develop a new form of what comes naturally. Customers have to do things for themselves and not feel like they are getting less service as a result. It's the quality of the coffee that counts.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/technology/asian-firms-more-likely-embrace-public-cloud-survey", "site_title": "Asian firms more likely to embrace public cloud: survey", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nAsian firms more likely to embrace public cloud: survey\n\nBusinesses keen to move backend needs to third-party cloud vendors\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jul 6, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nCLOUD computing is the top spending priority in technology for companies in Asia, and businesses are keen on moving backend needs to third-party cloud providers, Gartner found in a recent survey.\n\nThe global study surveyed 2,339 chief innovation officers (CIOs) from firms that make over US$250 million annually, and found that the cloud was nominated as the top area for new technology spending by CIOs from the Asia-Pacific region, including Japan.\n\nAbout 31 per cent of businesses in the region were enthusiastic adopters of the public cloud, having made \"significant investments\" in it. By comparison, 25 per cent of companies elsewhere had cloud investments.\n\nThe technology sector defines the public cloud as cloud infrastructure and services provided by third-party vendors. This concept is distinguished from the private cloud, which describes servers and applications owned and operated by the companies themselves.\n\nWhile the public cloud helps to immediately offload the cost of buying and managing the architecture to a vendor, some companies have expressed reluctance at going public because of the fear of leaving their systems and data in the hands of a third party.\n\nThe Gartner study, however, found that companies in the region embraced the public cloud, and revealed that IT departments are using the cloud for their backend needs. This was reflected in the survey finding that about half of Asian businesses use the cloud's infrastructure such as storage and computing on demand, far above the global average of about 28 per cent.\n\nThis demonstrates the comfort level that companies here have with the public cloud, to the extent that they're able to trust their backend systems to it, said Lee Poh-Ling, vice-president and executive partner at Gartner.\n\nMs Lee, who was part of the team that created the survey, said that cloud adoption here is driven by the desire to be more agile, as businesses gear up for a lot more business done online.\n\nFor instance, a business which wants to launch a new mobile app needs its IT department to quickly provide the computing resources to support the app. Traditionally, purchasing servers to handle this can take days or weeks, but a cloud purchase can be done in an hour with a credit card, she said.\n\nFurthermore, opening that mobile app or site means that the backend needs to be resilient enough to handle spikes in demand from visitors, and tapping a third-party cloud is the economical way to do this without buying a new set of hardware to prepare for this scenario, she added. \"The agility with being able to launch a new campaign is the top factor, not cost. Cost was the third or fourth-ranked reason down the line when we spoke to CIOs,\" she said.\n\nAs for the rest of the list of technology spending priorities in the Asia-Pacific region, mobile took second place, followed by analytics and business intelligence, ERP (enterprise resource planning), and data centre infrastructure. Globally, analytics was the top priority, followed by data centre infrastructure, mobile, ERP and the cloud was fifth.\n\nMs Lee said that the majority of survey responses came from the Americas and Europe, which have a higher number of businesses which embraced IT earlier than Asia. This has resulted in a lot more aged infrastructure, which explains why data centre spending was No 2 on the global list, she said.\n\n\"A lot of 'renovate the core' tasks are still the primary responsibility for CIOs, despite all the new trends that they have to chase like mobile and analytics. You have to constantly check and replace the plumbing in an old house,\" said Ms Lee.\n\nGartner's findings corroborate IDC data that pegged the public cloud market at US$47.4 billion last year. IDC also expects this segment to grow at a compound annual rate of 23.5 per cent to reach US$107 billion in 2017.\n\nIn a McKinsey report from last year, cloud technology is expected to benefit the global economy in the form of productivity improvements and economies of scale from tapping online services. By 2025, that could be somewhere in the region of US$500 billion to US$700 billion in productivity gains, and US$1.2 trillion to US$5.5 trillion in surplus from using cloud-based IT services, it said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Another factor aiding the growth in number of Chinese travellers will come from less-restrictive travel regulations imposed by destination countries, it said.\n\nBarclays believes there will be weakness in the near term from one-off events such as the political unrest in Thailand and the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, but sees opportunity for the region's airports further down the road.\n\n\"We expect global air traffic volumes in 2014 to increase 5.8 per cent year on year, driven by structural growth in Chinese outbound tourism and a cyclical recovery in developed markets,\" it said.\n\nIn Asia, passenger volume growth slowed between the end of last year and April as a result of those one-off events, but will re-accelerate as passengers move on from those events towards the end of the year, said Barclays.\n\nOutbound Chinese travel grew 21 per cent, based on the five-year compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2009 and last year; the growth figure excludes trips to the Special Administrative Regions (SARs) of Hong Kong and of Macau.\n\n\"We estimate that every 1 per cent increase in per capita Chinese Gross Domestic Product could spur 1.8 per cent growth in resident departures, excluding trips to the SARs,\" Barclays said.\n\nOf less-restrictive travel regulations imposed by destination countries, Barclays singled out Airports of Thailand (AOT) as being among the global infrastructure assets best-placed to ride the wave of outbound Chinese tourists. Its strengths are its proximity to China, its low visa requirements and the variety of destinations offered.\n\nBarclays said the region's airports could be in for disappointing results in the last and current quarters of this calendar year because of the recent events, but suggested that investors use the resultant share price weakness as an opening to accumulate AOT, trading at 18.1 times 2015 PE.\n\nOutside Asia, Barclays is also \"generally positive\" on Mexican airports, which should benefit from resurgent US outbound travel. It holds a neutral view on European airports, as it sees current valuations fairly reflecting the expected mild traffic recovery.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The towers have a total of 461 freehold units.\n\nLaunching this weekend at Ramada Singapore Zhong Shan Park, prices range from A$400,000 (S$466,000) to A$490,000 for a one-bedroom apartment at 41 to 89 sq m and A$1.25 million to A$2 million for a three-bedroom unit at 115 to 168 sq m.\n\nMeanwhile, Aspial will be launching its own apartments, claiming to be the \"highest residence in the Southern Hemisphere\". Located at the periphery of the Melbourne business district, Aspial's skyscraper will stand at 319 metres tall. Though the Gold Coast's \"Q1\" stands at 323 metres, Aspial's building, with habitable levels of up to 100, allows residents to live far higher than Q1's 71 habitable levels. Slated to be launched in Q4, preliminary figures place one-bedroom apartments of 45 to 55 sq m at A$450,000.\n\nHiap Hoe and Aspial belong to a growing group of property developers who have chosen Australia as the first step in their overseas expansion.\n\nAspial bought its first property in January, and has since acquired three more. Three of these properties are in Melbourne, while one is in Cairns. Hiap Hoe began its overseas expansion last year, and so far has four properties in Australia, three in Melbourne and one in Perth. AIMS AMP Capital Industry Reit and Suntec Reit have also made Australia their first destination abroad.\n\nThe trend to go overseas is partly due to the less sanguine outlook for the Singapore property market. The Urban Redevelopment Authority's official private home price index has fallen 3.2 per cent since its peak in Q3 last year, as a result of macroprudential policies limiting the debt that individuals can take on.\n\nBut Australia's popularity also reflects the buoyancy of its property market, which has seen prices rise 10.9 per cent in the one year since June 2013, according to Frank Knight.\n\nAndrew Leoncelli, managing director, CBRE Residential Project Victoria, and the co-ordinating agent for Marina Tower Melbourne, said: \"The local demand is very strong and we expect robust sales driven by this strong interest.\"\n\nAspial CEO Koh Wee Seng is equally sanguine. \"We see significant opportunities and interest in the Melbourne property scene - given it has been voted the most livable city in the world,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This runs contrary to the fact that most lease agreements have a variable rent component based on gross turnover (GTO).\n\nMost landlords here, except for strata-titled owners, charge their tenants a base rent and a percentage of GTO. The rent structures vary across tenants and locations. Some tenants pay both a base rent and a turnover rent of 0.5-2 per cent; others pay by either that formula or purely turnover rent of 10-20 per cent - whichever is higher. There are other permutations in the rent calculations.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They have the option of renting from another mall owner with less onerous terms.\n\nThat said, their options may soon narrow in future, as other categories of landlords begin to adopt the business practices used by Reits and some property funds.

During my two weeks in Sao Paulo, I felt as safe as I would in any other major city of the world. I did not have suspicious characters approaching me, nor was I taken for a ride by any of the locals. Of course, there are areas of the city one would be advised to stay away from, especially at night, but this is true of most other cities around the world too.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The bank is going through a period of \"balance sheet optimisation\", essentially meaning it has to lend in markets where it commands liquidity used to fund these loans.\n\nIn this area, ING is well-placed in Europe, where it has a retail banking arm to collect deposits. ING is the largest bank in Benelux and the third-largest retail bank in Germany, Mr Newman said.\n\n\"What we've seen through the crisis, is that our deposit base has grown,\" he added.\n\n\"Regulations mean the movement of liquidity is not as free as it used to be. If you look at Europe, we have a number of pools of liquidity. We're building up the expertise in locations that have liquidity, so that we're able to book the relevant assets to match that liquidity.\"\n\nThis also comes as more Asian clients are going into Europe, with this business growing at a faster clip than that of European clients coming into Asia, said Mr Newman.\n\nDeals with Asian clients going into Europe made up 18 per cent of the bank's commercial banking revenue in Asia. Another 15 per cent constitute deals with non-Asian clients booked in Asia, with the remaining made up of deals with Asian clients booked in the region.\n\nAs national regulators now favour the \"Balkanisation\" concept - which ensures that lending in one jurisdiction by a foreign bank is primarily funded within that jurisdiction, not through deposits from its home market - global banks have to turn to more expensive forms of funding.\n\nThis forces lenders, including ING, to cherry-pick the transactions they chase in foreign markets, to earn a rich enough margin.\n\nAlso, on the backdrop is the rise of Asian banks that are gunning for a slice of the trade finance pie. These banks have yet to build a European network that banks such as ING have had for years, or they may not have the same level of expertise in more specialised financing targeted at different sectors' needs.\n\nSuch specialised financing could include asset-backed securities. To do this, banks pool assets and repack them into securities that pay interest to investors. Banks also offer financing based on the value of commodity inventories.\n\n\"They are a much more significant competitor than they were before, and will continue to be so,\" said Mr Newman, referring to Asian banks.\n\n\"They can definitely grow their expertise, and they can hire people, and build teams. Will they grow domestically and regionally? Yes. But our global expertise will take a little bit longer (to grow).\"\n\nING has been restructuring its business since 2008, when it was bailed out by the Dutch government via capital injections of some 10 billion euros (S$17 billion), after being hit by its soured portfolio of US mortgage-backed securities.\n\nOCBC snapped up ING Asia's private banking unit - now known as Bank of Singapore - in late 2009.\n\nING is nearing the end of this restructuring process. Its insurance unit, NN Group, was listed this week, with the IPO proceeds to be used to pare debt. Temasek Holdings is one of the anchor investors in NN Group, which consists of ING's European and Japanese insurance businesses.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Debbie Yong\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jul 4, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWHEN it comes to packing for guest chef stints abroad, Japanese chef Hideaki Matsuo is used to forgoing precious suitcase space for extra socks or that spare apron for carefully squirrelled away packets of bonito and kelp instead.\n\nBottling pre-made dashi stock ahead of time or dialling up Singapore-based suppliers to pre-order a commercially produced substitute is out of the question: the 51-year-old chef's fierce insistence on making everything from scratch - just as he does in his three Michelin star restaurant Kashiwaya in Osaka - is a philosophy that travels with him too.\n\nThe seeming hassle all pays off when the food is placed in front of you at the table.\n\nIn town recently to cook at the Diners des Grand Chefs Singapour organised by Saint Pierre restaurant to fete the 60th anniversary of hospitality fellowship, Relais and Chateaux, Chef Matsuo cooked alongside Taiwanese Chef Lanshu Chen - recently named Asia's Best Female Chef in this year's Asia's 50 Best Restaurants Awards - and Singapore-based Emmanuel Stroobant.\n\nFor starters, fingers of codfish sashimi is robed in a crispy yuba skin and served on spears of thyme. His main course, a Kashiwaya Platter, showcased soya-marinated akami tuna next to a rich blob of egg yolk, pine nut cream and a melt-in-your mouth dashi jelly in golden hamaguri shell. Next to that, a platter of textures: a crispy nugget of amadai fish, sweet prawns and wild mushrooms on a sunshine yellow egg sauce and lightly grilled Hokkaido scallop under opulent shavings of bottarga. It is light, refreshing and traditional yet forward-looking all at once.\n\nYou find out later that even the chopsticks have been personally handcarried over from Japan. Hand carved by craftsmen from the Nara prefecture in Japan - one of the country's oldest - and tapered at both ends, they are the exact same ones he uses at Kashiwaya. \"One side is designed for man, one side is designed for god, so we can eat together,\" says Chef Matsuo of its traditional shape used only for special occasions.\n\nEach of the chopsticks are in fact delivered individually, he reveals, and his team of nine kitchen staff and eight service staff have to painstakingly pair sticks with similar wood patterns up and bind them together with the restaurant's rice paper sticker.\n\nNever mind that such attention is something most would easily overlook. The Osaka native isn't used to doing things by convention anyway.\n\nAfter graduating with a degree in theoretical physics, Chef Matsuo trained with Shuntaro Nakamura, the head chef at Shofukuro, a highly regarded ryotei in Higashioumi, Shigaken, for three years.\n\nAll this time, his father was managing a little restaurant in the outskirts of Osaka in a building that had stood since 1868. In 1993, he took over the restaurant as head chef, renovated the space to resemble a traditional tea house with five private dining rooms for groups of four up to 30.\n\n\"I don't feel like I have inherited my family business. My father started the business quite late, when he was 45 years old. I found myself as a chef with friends of the same philosophy and decided to build this restaurant on the same space,\" says the smiley though reserved chef.\n\nHis cooking style is something that evolves year by year, he says, with each overseas trip etching new impressions.\n\n\"I think about how and what I can improve on everyday. In the last two years, this has increasingly meant travelling abroad more often to see how other chefs work,\" says Chef Matsuo, who was most recently a guest chef at the Chicago Gourmet food festival late last year and will be heading to the Caribbean and Paris this year. He previously was a consulting chef behind Uo Kura, a kaiseki restaurant in Shanghai, but that contract has since ended, he says.\n\n\"Eating is my greatest influence. I've loved prawns and fish roe since I was a child, but I'll eat anything,\" he says. \"I like to try new things I've never had before. Every country I go to, I'll try to look for local dishes that I can't find in Japan.\"\n\nThe amadai fish nugget served at Saint Pierre showcase, for instance, are influenced by the Singaporean har cheong gai, or prawn paste chicken, a hawker centre classic. In his restaurant, the same fish is typically served grilled together with its scales, and is an oft-requested winter special.\n\nBut despite his drive to stretch his vision globally, holding fast to the tenets of traditional Japanese cooking is something he makes a priority, he states. It is also a mentality he tries to instill in his young chefs - by taking them on regular visits to the museum.\n\n\"I want to teach them to maintain tradition. Cooking is getting so much easier for the younger generation as many tasks can easily be accomplished with the help of machinery these days,\" he observes. \"The young now want to skip the discipline, But I want to teach not to forget the basics.\"\n\n\"At museums, I try to get them to touch objects, and through that appreciate the work that goes into building a piece of beautiful art, and in presenting it in a way that creates a feeling of hospitality,\" he further elaborates.\n\nAnd though that intention has generally found resonance among his team, it has oddly fallen on deaf ears at home, he laughs. Says Chef Matsuo, whose wife runs the front of house at Kashiwaya, and with whom he has three daughters aged 16, 19 and 21: \"They were interested in cooking when they were younger, but not so much anymore.\"\n\nHe muses in his gentle manner: \"Generation by generation, great traditions are fading away.\"\n\nBy Debbie Yong\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\n@DebbieYongBT\n\nSnow crab cake with baby jade eggplant, bottarga and dashi\n\nIngredients\n\n100g minced white fish\n\n200g Japanese snow crab meat\n\nThe white of one egg\n\n4 eggplants\n\n90cc dashi\n\n10 cc Japanese sake\n\nBottarga, sliced as a stick\n\nA pinch of salt\n\nMethods\n\nFor the snow crab cake\n\n1.

The unemployment rate dropped to 6.1 per cent from 6.3 per cent, to stand at its lowest level since September 2008, when the financial and economic crisis began in earnest.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 92 points to close at 17,086, breaking through the 17,000 milestone less than a year after it closed above 16,000 for the first time. Observers might be forgiven for wondering why the Dow didn't rally further, however, given the long wait for a jobs report like last Friday's. The report showed improvement in many of the areas thought to be holding back the recovery: the number of workers forced to stay in part-time jobs, the steady stream of workers who had given up looking for jobs, and the growth of both the private and public sectors.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That demand is helping to drive imports of sofas and beds to furnish houses and building materials and plastics used in construction.\n\n\"If you buy a new house, you need new furnishing,\" Rahul Kapoor, a Singapore-based analyst at Drewry Financial Services Ltd said last week. \"Furnishing and building materials all come out of Asia. It's definitely a positive for demand.\"\n\nTotal US imports of furniture and building materials and plastics used in construction from Asia rose to 971,678 standard containers, or TEUs, in the first four months of this year, compared with 914,042 a year earlier, according to figures from the Japan Maritime Centre.\n\nLi & Fung, also the world's biggest supplier of clothes and toys to retailers such as Wal-Mart, posted a 17 per cent jump in net income to a record US$725 million in 2013 amid higher sales. The Hong Kong-based company's biggest customer is Wal-Mart, accounting for 15.4 per cent of sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, while Target, the second largest US discount retailer, is the next biggest, with 5.8 per cent of revenue.\n\nThe rise in imports may be a boost for both discounters, which have struggled to grow revenue in the US. In Wal-Mart's first quarter ended April 30, sales rose 0.8 per cent to US$114.2 billion while comparable-store revenue in the US was little changed. At Target, revenue gained 2.1 per cent to US$17.1 billion in its first quarter. Home department sales declined as US same-store sales fell 0.3 per cent for a second straight drop.\n\nBrooke Buchanan, a spokeswoman for Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart declined to comment because it does not discuss its relationships with clients. Eric Hausman, a spokesman for Minneapolis-based Target, declined to comment.\n\nThe US posted the biggest new home sales jump in 22 years in May as sales surged 18.6 per cent in May, the biggest one-month surge nationwide since January 1992, according to figures from the Commerce Department.\n\nStill, rates for carrying containers to the US from Asia have tumbled this year as an increase in new capacity is outweighing the increase in boxes being transported.\n\nContainer lines are suffering from an oversupply of vessels after a boom in ship purchases coincided with the financial crisis, triggering the worst slump in carriage fees since containerisation became global in the 1970s.\n\nThe global container fleet increased 6 per cent versus a year earlier, as at Sept 30, and stood at almost 17.2 million standard containers, according to AP Moeller-Maersk A/S, owner of the world's largest container line. The order book in the container industry is 21 per cent of the total container fleet in the water, Greek ship owner Costamare Inc said in September.\n\n\"Demand is definitely growing but the biggest drag on rates is supply,\" Bonnie Chan, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Jefferies Group Inc said last week. \"Spot rates have been weaker than last year. Net, net rates are going down.\"\n\nThe Drewry Hong Kong-Los Angeles container rate benchmark declined 5.7 per cent to US$1,650, the lowest since December 2011, in the week ended June 18 as four general increases this year have failed to hold.\n\nNippon Yusen KK, Japan's largest shipping line by sales, predicts that its container line business will return to profit this fiscal year as sales increase. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/02a2be263319ce27a490be12107f19db47022ec3fb1898d43412a6b4c3789b45?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Roaring trade: The global container fleet has increased 6%, says AP Moeller-Maersk. - PHOTO: AFP"}]}

A total of 15 companies recorded 25 purchases worth $4.9 million versus seven firms with 16 disposals worth $6.3 million. The number of companies and trades on the buying side were consistent with the previous week's 16 firms and 26 purchases. The buy value, however, was nearly double the previous week's acquisitions worth $2.6 million. The sales, on the other hand, were up from the previous week's six companies, 13 disposals, and $0.74 million.\n\nMeanwhile, the buyback activity fell with only seven firms that posted 21 repurchases worth $7.7 million. The figures were down from the previous week's nine companies, 34 trades, and $10.2 million.\n\nThe trading was spread across several sectors with buybacks in Singapore Airlines and Xyec Holdings and insider purchases in Dynamic Colours Limited, Singapore Shipping Corporation and China Yuanbang Property. On the selling side, there were insider sales in Haw Par Corporation, Chew's Group and Communication Design International.\n\nSingapore Airlines\n\nCommercial airliner and engineering services provider Singapore Airlines Limited picked up where it left off in April with 548,000 shares purchased from June 26 to July 1 at an average of $10.38 each. The trades accounted for 12 per cent of the stock's trading volume. The group previously acquired 3.4 million shares from March 13 to April 7 at $10.11 to $10.46 each or an average of $10.35 each.\n\nPrior to the buybacks this year, the company acquired 31 million shares from December 2010 to May 2012 at $15.27 to $10.16 each or an average of $11.43 each, 7.48 million shares from March 2008 to March 2009 at $16.12 to $9.39 each or an average of $13.01 each and 65.2 million shares from September 1999 to April 2001 at $15.90 to $11.50 each or an average of $15.69 each. The stock closed at $10.38 on Friday.\n\nXyec Holdings\n\nEngineering and IT services provider Xyec Holdings bought back for the first time since listing in September 2013 with 77,000 shares purchased from June 30 to July 2 at an average of 20.5 cents each. The trades, which accounted for 46 per cent of the stock's trading volume, were made on the back of the 32 per cent drop in the share price since April from 30 cents. Despite the fall in the share price, the counter is still up since November 2013 from 14 cents. The group's purchase price was lower than the initial public offering (IPO) price of 26 cents.\n\nInvestors should note that there were purchases by chairman & CEO Manabu Kobayashi and Mamezou Holdings Co Ltd this year. Mr Kobayashi purchased 350,000 shares on March 31 at 21 cents each, which increased his direct holdings by 28 per cent to 1.595 million shares or 1.45 per cent of the issued capital. He previously acquired 300,000 shares in December 2013 at 15.1 cents each.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jul 4, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nHOW exciting can cardboard pieces be? Give some to Bartholomew Ting and he makes them come to life by turning them into robots, animals, and even an F1 racing car, sometimes creating larger than life pieces.\n\nMr Ting first discovered his love of working with cardboard when he was creating a float during his university days. The cardboard sculptor is often hired to design pieces for events, such as a 12.5m-high cardboard pavilion for Singapore Management University Patron's Day 2014. \"Cardboard is an everyday material. The familiarity, sustainability, recyclability, accessibility all add to the appeal of cardboard for me,\" says Mr Ting.\n\nFor each creation, he does rough sketches and elevation views before creating a 3D digital model out of them, and then converting the 3D model to 2D templates. He used to manually cut the pieces of cardboard into shape, but now uses a machine. The pieces of cardboard are then later assembled by hand. He uses cardboard from Tri-Wall Group, a cardboard manufacturing company.\n\nMr Ting is one of nearly 50 makers participating at Makers' Block, the largest learning festival for makers in Singapore.\n\nThe makers' culture in Singapore tends to focus on crafts and food. Makers' Block still celebrates the hand-making movement but with a slant towards art and technology. So think 3D printing, miniature plastic sculpting, soldering electronics or even learning how to build your own app.\n\n\"The makers' scene is still very new and fresh,\" says organiser William Hooi, founder of SG Makers, a community that advocates technology and innovation through the makers' movement.\n\nMr Hooi hopes that Makers' Block will mark the start of more similar festivals and open new opportunities for local makers and future would-be makers to exhibit and market their work.\n\n\"This is also to encourage Singaporeans to work with their hands and create something of their dreams,\" he says. \"Making things with one's hands brings pride to the individual when others admire the hand-made, completed work.\"\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\n@TaySuanChiangBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Domestic demand, at the end of the day, doesn't drive growth over the long term,\" he said.\n\nProductivity growth in most of Asia, excluding China, has been lax. The level of output per worker is between 10 and 30 per cent of that in the advanced economies, said Mr Tharman.\n\nTo that end, Singapore, which is still on a productivity push, cannot be ranked alongside the advanced economies yet.\n\n\"We've got a very high per capita GNP or GDP, but the median income level - and the actual average level of productivity - is not truly advanced. It's basically an upper- middle-income society.\"\n\nStill, there has been some progress in productivity in Singapore's manufacturing sector, Mr Tharman noted. In the food manufacturing industry, productivity has increased 25 per cent in the last three years.\n\n\"We can be a high-value, diversified economy,\" said Mr Tharman.\n\nAnd becoming a \"truly advanced economy\" is not a matter of dictating wages, even as the government tightens the labour market to create \"incentive and pressure to innovate\", he said.\n\n\"We have the opportunity to invest in the skills and the ingenuity of Singaporeans, and release entrepreneurial energy.\"\n\nIn fact, many new businesses are formed in Singapore each year, but there is a lack of differentiation - meaning that some restructuring is also needed in the enterprise scene, Mr Tharman said. \"We need more disruptive players in every sector.\"\n\nAsked about China, Mr Tharman noted that while China has made great strides and has \"the most competent\" economic team among the major economies, it is facing the most complex issues in the world that are weighed down by legacy.\n\nThese include the size of shadow banking, linked in part to the credit needs of municipal governments in China that are not being matched by productive ways of revenue growth. And China has to calibrate any major restructuring, which often comes with retrenchment.\n\n\"It can't afford to take that dive in growth . . . because the risk of social disruption is a very serious one. They've had it once every 25-30 years over a long period of time. I don't think they want it again,\" said Mr Tharman.\n\nIndia, which is now under the new leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has \"the best chance\" in a long time of making strong economic gains, said Mr Tharman, as Mr Modi is focused on introducing more efficiency, such as in streamlining approval for projects. But it also has legacy problems, such as a significant fiscal deficit - solutions to which could include the difficult task of creating a nation-wide consumption tax that replaces a range of taxes at the state and federal level\n\nAs for Indonesia, its young population can prove to be an impediment to growth as a quarter of them are not educated, or employed. \"If you don't (educate and train), then the demographic dividend becomes a demographic challenge, to put it mildly,\" said Mr Tharman.\n\nStructural reform is also needed among advanced economies, which can also no longer rely on loose monetary policy to address long-term issues such as unemployment. \"I don't see a hard landing in global economies. The real risk we face is prolonged subnormal growth,\" he said.\n\nThe longer the central bank, such as the US Federal Reserve, takes to deal with unemployment, the more futile its efforts will be, as those who have been out of work for a long time are no longer in demand in the workforce due to skills atrophy, said Mr Tharman. \"That is the quietly growing tragedy of the post-crisis environment in the US and in Europe.\"\n\nMeanwhile, risks of financial-market exuberance are building. In a speech this week, Fed chair Janet Yellen indicated that to tackle this, regulations can be used to keep the banks in line. But Mr Tharman noted instability is also building up among non-banking institutions.\n\nThis also points to a broader issue of the risk of over-reliance on central banks: \"That you let Congress off the hook, and you could say the same in Europe,\" said Mr Tharman. \"What it really takes is structural reform.\"\n\n.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The indie-pop singer will be in Singapore to tour the album at the Esplanade Concert Hall this September.\n\nAbout her record, Michaelson says: \"I think this record for me is about understanding that there's a lot of sadness and darkness in the world. But it's so important to still find what makes you happy and focus on that in your life. And try to stay positive.\"\n\nAccording to her, Lights Out was written after a difficult time in her life, when she was feeling unwell and some of her family members were ill as well.\n\nBut after she recovered, she suddenly felt inspired to do something different while making her album.\n\nSo instead of writing the entire record on her own the way she usually does, Michaelson reached out to 11 different co-writers and six different producers to work with her on the album. These include some indie singer-songwriters such as Trent Dabbs and A Great Big World, as well as writer-producers like Busbee (Pink, Katy Perry, Lady Antebellum).\n\n\"The record has a real collaborative feeling, and there's a bunch of duets on it, and my friends sang vocals. It was a real sort of family affair,\" says Michaelson. Even her musician husband Greg Laswell can be heard on one of the tracks titled Wonderful Unknown.\n\nUltimately, collaborating with other musicians is one way that Michaelson hopes to set her new songs apart from the ones she is best known for, such as The Way I Am (2007), Maybe (2009) and Everybody (2010).\n\nShe says: \"I'm seven years older than I was when I wrote The Way I Am, so I feel like I'm a different person. I don't want to make the same record over and over again, and I don't want to be known as the girl who sang that one song.\"\n\nIngrid Michaelson will perform in Singapore on Sept 26 at 8pm at the Esplanade Concert Hall.

So rather than them spending time merely playing games, how about equipping them with the skills to design their own apps instead?\n\nJapanese firm Life is Tech was set up three years ago to teach junior high and high school students programming skills to design their own apps, as well as game design and animation skills. To date it has taught about 3,000 students across several Japanese cities.\n\nKenta Tsuihiji, Life is Tech's overseas manager, says that \"most people think that IT skills are difficult to learn, but they are not\". He adds that, \"we decided to teach these skills as there are no such programmes available in high schools\".\n\nThe plan is now to bring the programme to Singapore, especially for secondary school students. Last month, it held an IT camp for several local students to learn programming. \"Students are taught by computer science students from the National University of Singapore,\" says Mr Tsuihiji, who adds that similarly in Japan, the high school students are taught by university students.\n\nThe students begin by learning Objective-C, a programming language, before they pick up skills on how to build their own apps. Or if they have interest in games, they are taught to use a software called GameSalad, which allows them to build 2D action, puzzle and shooting games. Mr Tsuihiji says that the annual IT camp is very popular in Japan. \"Over 30 kids who have attended the camp have gone on to develop and publish apps which are sold to Apple's App store.\" He adds that two junior high students have also gone on to start their own programming companies.\n\nThe next IT camp will be held in December, and a three-day course will cost $599.

Many times more will be spent illegally.\n\n\"I find it so much easier to bet on an app, rather than having to go to a lottery centre,\" said Li Qiang, from Shanghai, who said he won 200 yuan when Uruguay beat Italy in the group stage.\n\n\"I love the World Cup but being Chinese, we have little way to get involved other than to bet,\" he said, lamenting the poor performances of the national team, who are ranked 103rd by Fifa.\n\nNeither Tencent nor Alibaba has gambling licences but both earn revenue by acting as online platforms for provincial lotteries which offer odds betting on most aspects of the game.\n\nAlibaba - which heavily promotes World Cup betting on its main e-commerce shopping platform, Taobao - takes a 7 per cent cut of money gambled through its websites, the Beijing Youth Daily reported.\n\nOn Thursday, an advertisement on Taobao priced Brazil as favourites to win the tournament at 2.3/1, less generous than the 2.75/1 generally available from British bookmakers.\n\nMore than 500 million people in China access the Internet via their smartphones, according to the state-run China Internet Network Information Center.\n\n\"The law is quite strict in China, but gaming opportunities are very accessible to anyone who has a smartphone,\" Huang Guihai, associate professor at the Gaming Teaching and Research Centre at the Macao Polytechnic Institute, told AFP.\n\nInsurance firms have found their attempts to do World Cup business meeting official disapproval.\n\nAn Cheng Insurance offered a \"heartbreak\" policy offering fans Taobao credit if their team was eliminated to \"alleviate the mental shock\" - effectively enabling customers to try to profit from teams going out of the contest.\n\nRegulators stepped in last week to issue an urgent notice that \"insurance products with gaming character should be suspended\", the official news agency Xinhua said. \"Some insurance companies have pulled related World Cup regret insurances from the shelves,\" it added.\n\nMost Chinese sports betting, though, takes place via outlawed websites, where odds are more attractive and credit offered.\n\nResearch by sports newspaper Titan Weekly estimated an astonishing 500 billion yuan was spent on legal and illegal online gambling during the 2006 tournament in Germany - roughly 2 per cent of China's GDP.\n\n\"The issue of illegal gambling is particularly serious during the World Cup,\" said Wang Xuehong, head of the Lottery Research Institute at Peking University. Given the scale of the demand, official restrictions on betting created opportunities for illegal operators, he said. \"It is difficult to carry out measures to deal with it, and it is difficult to supervise Internet activities.\"\n\nThe sums and networks involved are vast. The Doha-based watchdog International Centre for Sport Security (ICSS) warned in a May report that Asian-dominated criminal groups are laundering more than US$140 billion in illegal sports betting annually, with many gamblers coming from China.\n\nLaurent Vidal, chair of the joint Sorbonne-ICSS research programme that produced the report, said previously: \"The Chinese are not interested in local sport any more, that is why they bet on European sport.\"\n\nIn May, police in Shanghai detained 63 people for being involved in an illegal online gambling operation that was alleged to have handled more than 113 billion yuan. Police in the southern province of Guangdong busted 1,651 criminal gambling cases in the months leading up to the World Cup, detaining 58,154 suspects in raids across the province, police said.\n\nFor the losers, though, the consequences can be fatal. A college student in Guangdong leaped to his death after losing more than US$3,000 gambling on the World Cup, state media reported last week, adding that moments earlier, the student was heard telling a telephone caller he would \"return the money\".\n\nA 32-year-old woman on the southern island of Hainan also reportedly committed suicide after losing more than US$16,000.\n\n\"There should be awareness training to let the public know of the potential risk of gambling becoming addictive,\" said Prof Huang, of the Macao Polytechnic Institute. \"With gambling, the rules favour the casinos, favour the lottery agencies. They provide this entertainment service for profit.\" AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

Theatre Awards (LTA) for his extraordinary performances in plays which he acted in and directed himself. Yet he is nowhere near as well-known as other multiple LTA winners such as actor-director Nelson Chia, actor Adrian Pang and playwright Alfian Sa'at.\n\nOne reason for his low profile is that he stages small-scale productions for short runs compared to his more famous peers. His upcoming production titled Butterfly, for instance, will be performed by just three actors and staged from July 17 to 19 at the Esplanade Theatre Studio, a small theatre with a seating capacity of 220.\n\nBut those who make the effort to catch it will most likely be rewarded with another lyrical and inventive work which uses physical theatre, music and puppetry to tell its poignant tale. Indeed, fans of Puccini's opera Madame Butterfly should make a beeline for it because it is loosely based on the story of Cio-cio San or \"Butterfly\", the virtuous woman who is betrayed by her lover.\n\nMeyyappan now lives in Scotland after marrying a Scottish theatre practitioner. He says via e-mail that he has never watched Puccini's opera himself, but found inspiration in the original short story written by John Luther Long.\n\nHe recalls: \"I found a beautifully illustrated book with an abridged version of the story. Quite possibly, the images from the book captured my imagination and made me pursue reading the original version written by Long. Madame Butterfly looks at many issues such as cultural differences, the trust of a woman, and the betrayal of a lover. However, the most powerful image created in me was how her child was taken from her. It was this final image or thought that really inspired in me a desire to create Butterfly.\"\n\nMeyyappan says the theme of loss is a universal one that makes Butterfly a tragedy accessible to all: \"In life, most of us suffer some form of loss - it has various guises and impacts on us at different levels.\"\n\nMeyyappan has pared down the story considerably but added certain fantasy elements to create an altogether fresh interpretation. For instance, the story will be depicted by live actors for most of the play - until nearing the end when Butterfly, unable to cope with her loss, conjures up a fantasy world she can escape into.\n\nMeyyappan says: \"In my play, Butterfly is a beautiful, independent woman at first - an independence that gives her freedom to make her own choices and do her own thing. It is only when others come into her life - attracted by her beauty - that we see she is fragile. And eventually, their demands and treatment of her are what break her.\"\n\n\"Butterflies... are both beautiful and fragile.\"\n\nButterfly will show at the Esplanade Theatre Studio from July 17 to 19 at 8pm.

One of these is called HetNet or heterogenous networks. HetNet will form an important backbone of the proposed Smart Nation Platform (SNP) that will help connect all government agencies so that they can share data with one another.\n\nHetNet is a type of network that allows optimal use of the wireless spectrum as devices can switch seamlessly between various types of wireless networks like 2G, 3G, 4G and WiFi, depending on signal strength. The Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) is expected to conduct trials for this technology in the coming months.\n\nTo find out more about this technology, BizIT spoke to Ruckus Wireless, a US-based wireless connectivity technology provider whose customers include Singapore telcos.

If you had polled a hundred football fans before the quarter-finals and asked whom they wanted to see in the semis, most would probably have plumped for Brazil, Germany, Argentina and the Netherlands.\n\nThey all count themselves among the powerhouses of global football, and it would take something very special for one of them to make that last push to be crowned champion next Monday.\n\nThe home favourites, Brazil, are still in the hunt for a record sixth World Cup. The Selecao will, however, have to find a way to win without their four-goal hero Neymar, the 22-year-old whose dream of playing in the final was shattered after sustaining a fractured vertebra in last Saturday's gritty 2-1 win over Colombia.\n\nFaced with the pressure of bringing glory to a nation of 200 million people, this Brazil team has coped admirably so far. Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari deserves the lion's share of the credit for piecing together a squad that truly believes it can win.\n\n\"To all the Brazilians, I want to tell you the time has arrived and we are going to go together,\" Scolari said before the start of the tournament. \"This is our World Cup.\"\n\nHis words could yet prove prophetic. He must now rally his troops once more as the titanic tussle with Germany looms large tomorrow (4am Wednesday, Singapore time).\n\nThe Germans didn't have to play exceptionally well in their 1-0 victory over France; nor did they really have to rev the engine all that often. The French were so frustratingly lacklustre throughout the 90 minutes, it was almost as if Germany were handed their fourth straight semi-final appearance on a platter.\n\nThree-time winners Germany have sputtered their way to the last four, never quite reaching the heights of their 4-0 thrashing of Portugal in their opening match.\n\nGerman coach Joachim Loew knows he will never get a better chance to eliminate the hosts, especially with Neymar out and Brazilian captain Thiago Silva suspended.\n\nWhoever makes it to the final will have to face either Argentina or the Netherlands.\n\nThe Dutch, in pursuit of their first-ever World Cup trophy, were often skating on thin ice as they stumbled their way past Costa Rica.\n\nThe much-feared attacking trio of Arjen Robben, Robin van Persie and Wesley Sneijder somehow failed to muster a single goal between them against the Central Americans.\n\nHolland coach Louis van Gaal stunned the crowd in Salvador, and the millions watching at home, by replacing his goalkeeper in the 121st minute.\n\nThat bold move turned out to be a stroke of genius, as the replacement Tim Krul pulled off two saves in the penalty shootout to end Costa Rica's fairytale journey and ensure Holland would meet Argentina in the second semi-final on Wednesday (4am Thursday, Singapore time).\n\nUnlike the Dutch, the South Americans had a relatively fuss- free afternoon in Brasilia by easing past Belgium with a 1-0 scoreline.\n\nStriker Gonzalo Higuain's first goal of the tournament - a crisp volley in the eighth minute - was enough to send the last of the World Cup's dark horses packing.\n\nArgentina, winners in 1978 and 1986, are now in the semi-finals for the first time in 24 long years. The dream final between the two giants of South American football is still on the cards.\n\nNo European nation has ever lifted the golden trophy when the tournament has been held in South America, but in this most unpredictable of World Cups, both Germany and the Netherlands will go all out to rewrite the history books.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This means that OCBC's offer is no longer subject to conditions such as the Singapore bank needing to successfully acquire a certain percentage of Wing Hang shares.\n\nThe bid, however, could be in for a bit of a rocky road ahead. This after hedge-fund firm Elliott Management revealed yesterday that it had raised its stake in Wing Hang to 7.8 per cent, worth a total of HK$3 billion. In a filing with the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, Elliott said it had purchased an extra 8.7 million Wing Hang shares this week for HK$125 each.\n\nUnder Hong Kong rules, OCBC needs to own about 90 per cent of Wing Hang shares in order to delist the company. In a report yesterday, the Wall Street Journal described this as a \"tougher proposition\" with the larger stake now held by Elliott.\n\nIn April this year, OCBC offered to buy all of Wing Hang's shares for HK$125 (about S$20) a share, for a total offer of HK$38.4 billion. OCBC chief executive Samuel Tsien said at an April briefing that the deal would be \"truly transformational\" for Singapore's second-largest lender, helping to accelerate its expansion in Greater China.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Tuesday marked the start of the first Singapore T-shirt Festival showcasing the T-shirt as a medium for self-expression and its influence on street culture.\n\nThe festival, which comprises a month-long exhibition, as well as a marketplace, talks and workshops, is organised by Singaporean design practitioner Joseph Chiang of Monster Gallery together with Legendary Social Tees, a T-shirt printing company. \"We were chatting about T-shirts and what we can do with them, and then the topic developed into how T-shirts are a form of social media, even before the topic became hot,\" says Mr Chiang. \"Think about it - T-shirts are worn as a statement, which is what going on social media is about too. So T-shirts are really a prelude to social media.\" With this in mind, Mr Chiang roped in a group of artist friends to design a collection of T-shirts. Later he invited his designer friends to come onboard, when the DesignSingapore Council showed an interest in the project and sponsored a space at the National Design Centre for the exhibition.\n\nSome 22 designers are involved in the project, including well-known creative directors such as Pann Lim from Kinetic and Jackson Tan of Black Design and Phunk, as well as graphic designers Sarah Tang, and Alison Schooling, of Sarah and Schooling. \"I wanted to have a diverse group - so there are graphic designers, artists and illustrators involved,\" says Mr Chiang, who gave them free rein over what they wanted to do.\n\n\"But I posed them a question: 'If the T-shirt is your primary social medium, what would you show the world?'\", says Mr Chiang, who is a fan of Uniqlo T-shirts.\n\nSome designers turn their T-shirts into a wearable Facebook page, while others showed more personal designs, such as an illustration of their outfit for the day.\n\nMr Chiang himself, created a series of six T-shirts. The movie buff paid tribute to his favourite director, Alfred Hitchcock, by designing movie titles on them. Tang and Schooling designed a T-shirt with ads printed on it, to show that now social media platforms act as networks for businesses to achieve branding goals. \"We want to ask, when you wear our logo on a T-shirt, is it because you are a fan of our work, that you want to tell the world that you're a fan of our work, or is it because we really just want you to help us market the firm,\" says Ms Tang.\n\nMeanwhile Mr Tan and Mr Lim were both inspired by music influences when they designed their T-shirts. Mr Tan's T-shirt simply has the words, \"What's on your mind?\" printed on it. That is also the title of a song by Information Society, a synthpop band from the 1980s.\n\n\"Back during the MTV generation, wearing a band's T-shirt was the way to show the public that one liked the band. I remembered the song from Information Society and it eerily predicted the future of social media,\" says Mr Tan. \"Incidentally, the song title is the same as the question posed on our Facebook status bar.\"\n\nKinetic's Mr Lim grew up collecting T-shirts, especially designs from his favourite bands as they communicated a sense of identity - of who he was and what genre of music he loved. His T-shirt design for the exhibition is a parody of the typical metal music T-shirt.\n\n\"My interpretation for the T-shirt design is to juxtapose the typical masculine 'metal' style typography with a gentle message such as 'We Love Metal',\" he explains.\n\nAll the T-shirts at the exhibition are for sale at $50 each.\n\nOn July 19 and 20, Legendary Social Tees will be holding a marketplace featuring 20 independent retail labels, such as Uyii, OuterEdit and Statement, offering T-shirts and assorted apparels.

The family has invested over US$50 million so far to develop the Indonesian coal assets.\n\nLeveraging the family's experience and fast-growing energy requirements across Asia, PMRC has secured offtake agreements with Indonesian and Indian clients.\n\nSaid Tembusu's founder and chairman Andy Lim: \"As a pan-Asian fund backing fast-growing entrepreneurial companies, Tembusu looks forward to partnering IB Asia and the management team in building PMCR as a leading integrated platform, connecting Indonesia's vast coal resource base and India's fast growing energy needs.\"\n\nPMCR's chief executive Dev Sindhu said that the backing by IB Asia and Tembusu validates its business strategy amid rising interest in the Indonesian coal sector.\n\nHe said: \"We endeavour to develop PMCR as an integrated player in the coal-mining sector, focusing on developing a complete solution for all services from pit to port, under one umbrella.\n\n\"Our integrated service model and direct linkages with end-users ensure the viability and sustainability of its business, which will in turn create and enhance value for all stakeholders.\"\n\nEstablished in 2006, Tembusu Partners manages $270 million across four funds. It focuses on growth-stage companies across Asia, in sectors such as education, healthcare, technology and resources.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished Fri, Jul 4, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE Lexus NX not only has the distinction of being the Japanese luxury brand's first compact SUV but also its most stunningly styled volume model. Lexus already has the mid-sized RX, the slightly larger GX, and the full-sized LX sport-utility vehicles. But with the Lexus NX, the carmaker will be able to take on popular models such as the Audi Q5 and BMW X3. Like the other luxury compact crossovers, the all-wheel-drive NX is more suited for Orchard Road than rocky road. But unlike the competition, its design is especially striking.\n\nWith sharp \"3D\" surfaces and protruding wheel arch flares, the NX is said to hint at more aggressive Lexus designs in future. The bold shapes and angles convey an edginess not previously associated with Toyota's luxury division. The NX is described - somewhat intriguingly - as \"premium urban sports gear\". The rationale behind it is that the NX is like a high quality sports watch or bike, which balances daily life with an active weekend lifestyle while transcending mere trendy transport. But more exciting is the choice of a turbocharged engine for the NX. The NX200t has 235 hp and 350 Nm, and is slotted below the NX300h with the silky smooth petrol-electric hybrid powertrain that Lexus is famous for.\n\nLexus NX assistant chief engineer Sunao Ichihara explains that Toyota is no stranger to turbocharging, having used the technology successfully a decade ago when it was involved in rallying. Mated to a new six-speed automatic gearbox instead of the hybrid's continuously variable transmission, Lexus says this 2.0 twin-scroll turbo model provides an alternative for buyers who want a sportier drive. Mr Ichihara, who has a degree in aerospace, should know something about sporty driving. He was a key member of the team behind the LFA supercar and the NX was developed based on his LFA experience and aerodynamic skills. Mr Ichihara's work on the limited edition sports car has also resulted in LFA-inspired cues in the NX interior, such as the tight cockpit feel, leather-wrapped metal, cosmetic screw bolts and boost gauge.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The ECB says it sees no sign of that.\n\nMr Draghi said the ECB's Governing Council was united in its willingness to launch into quantitative easing - essentially creating money to buy government or private debt from banks to keep borrowing costs low and boost spending - if inflation headed lower still. He added that risks to economic recovery remained primarily negative.\n\n\"The Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to also using unconventional instruments within its mandate, should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation,\" Mr Draghi said.\n\nFew analysts expect that to be remotely possible until late this year. The central bank has said last month's moves could take up to a year to take full effect.\n\n\"After the rate cut in June, they'll wait . . . probably until the end of the year, to assess the effect that will have,\" Berenberg bank economist Christian Schulz said.\n\nBanks will be charged a 10 basis point premium over the ECB's main funding operations for the TLTROs, or targeted long-term refinancing operations.\n\nBy offering banks the four-year loans at low rates, the ECB hopes to entice banks to lend more freely, particularly to small and medium-sized companies in the eurozone periphery.\n\nBanks used large parts of the last round of cheap ECB funding in 2011-2012 to buy higher-yielding government bonds and the question is how the ECB will avoid similar behaviour this time and steer the money towards company loans instead.\n\nMr Draghi said the ECB would move to a schedule of six-weekly rather than monthly meetings from next year, mirroring the frequency of the US Federal Reserve's policy meetings. It will also publish regular minutes of its meetings, as the Fed and Bank of England do. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

They were beginning to come down when suddenly amid the patter of rain, we heard the clatter of small stones on the patio.\n\nI looked outside and saw little grey-white pellets bouncing off the cement floor. It was hail, the third year in succession that Burgundy was affected by hail - mostly in the Cote de Beaune, Pommard, Volnay and Meursault, which appeared to have been the most badly hit. My thoughts immediately went out to my friends who would be particularly affected. It is not funny when your harvest is reduced to 25 per cent of its usual size, and when this happens three years in succession, it can spell financial ruin for smaller growers. There does not seem to be anything one can do to guard against hail, except to pray.\n\nWe, my wife Melina and I, were in Burgundy for our annual visits to our friends, and this was the first time we have actually experienced hail ourselves. The hailstones we saw were approximately the size of small pebbles. Big enough to knock off the tiny fruit that was just beginning to appear following the flowering. I wondered what it would be like to be hit by such hail stones but decided against trying it out! The sharp clatter of those ice stones on the cement floor was enough to indicate that they would hurt like shotgun pellets. It was worst in Volnay, Pommard and Meursault where the stones reached golf-ball sizes and the crop lost was up to 70 per cent.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The consortium already owns a 19.9 per cent: Wilmar, a 10.1 per cent stake which it has held for two years, and the rest bought at A$0.70 a share.\n\nThe two-month-old offer was almost withdrawn after bidders claimed the maker of Meadow Lea spread, Meadowfresh milk and Praise mayonnaise has under-invested in plant and equipment as well as direct marketing expenditure over many years, Fairfax Media said.\n\nGoodman Fielder has A$549 million (S$649.6 million) in debt and is in need of a massive recapitalisation with around A$350 million in capital expenditure planned in the next couple of years. But it said that despite the latest write-downs it \"operates comfortably within its banking covenants\".\n\nThe revised offer comes as Goodman Fielder revealed a non-cash impairment charge of between A$300 million and A$400 million, \"reflecting the challenging trading conditions and outlook in its core baking and grocery businesses\", which will be booked for fiscal 2014. For the fiscal first-half of 2014, Goodman Fielder reported a net loss of A$61 million.\n\nThe group said that it expected normalised earnings before interest and taxation (Ebit) for fiscal 2014 to be between 10 per cent and 15 per cent below analysts' consensus of about A$180 million.\n\nYesterday, Wilmar said that Goodman Fielder's directors have unanimously recommended that shareholders \"vote in favour of the scheme in the absence of a superior proposal, subject to an independent expert opining that the scheme is in the best interests of shareholders\". Goodman Fielder's two largest shareholders, Ellerston Capital (10.64 per cent) and Perpetual Investments (8.94 per cent), are believed to have supported the revised offer.\n\nThe scheme booklet is expected to be sent to Goodman Fielder's shareholders and a meeting has been planned for November.\n\nWilmar and First Pacific had originally offered A$0.65 a share for Goodman Fielder in late April. They later raised their offer to A$0.70 a share in May after securing the support of Perpetual and Ellerston.\n\nBut The Australian said that Wilmar's lawyer La-Mae Teo rang Goodman Fielder's chairman, Stephen Gregg, last Friday to inform him that the bid must be lowered. While the due diligence did not uncover any \"black holes\" in the business, it did raise concerns about the amount of investment required to turn it around.\n\nGoodman Fielder has made a series of profit warnings in recent years including the latest on April 15, just two weeks before the takeover bid emerged. The deal, which requires investor support of 75 per cent, includes a condition that there be no \"material adverse change\" in earnings. Regulatory approval is also required from the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Overseas Investment Office in New Zealand.\n\nGoodman Fielder shares fell below the offer price yesterday when trading resumed. They fell 2.9 per cent to A$0.66 a share in Sydney. In Singapore, Wilmar rose three Singapore cents to S$3.20 a share, while in Hong Kong, First Pacific also hovered higher around HK$8.91 a share.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A ball, some open ground, and something to mark the goalposts with - that's all that one needs. Girls and boys all over the world play it, and dream of being Messi, Neymar or Ronaldo.\n\nDespite or perhaps because of its simplicity, football provides lots of examples of innovation in the quest for success. Some involve the rigorous enforcement of what ought to be blindingly obvious, as when Arsene Wenger arrived at Arsenal in 1996, weaned the back four off their traditional diet of lager and crisps, and in the process transformed the Premier League.\n\nOthers are more novel and creative, with perhaps the best recent example being how Spain transformed itself from a footballing backwater to a powerhouse, adopting a new style of play in every academy, one suited to the build and temperament of Spanish schoolboys - short, nimble and quick - that evolved into \"tiki-taka\": one-touch, short-passing, possession football.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Not surprisingly, then, most corporate governance failures occur within these group entities outside of the ultimate listed parent company.\n\nYet, the ultimate parent is inevitably financially liable for the \"sins\" of the group entities and also faces significant reputational damage.\n\n\"We believe that the lack of attention by group boards and management to governance issues within the wider group is an important reason for the problems faced by many multinationals today,\" Prof Mak said.\n\nThe report, Governance of Company Groups, published by CPA Australia and the Iclif Leadership & Governance Centre, studied 150 of the largest listed companies in Singapore, Malaysia and Australia. Prof Mak is an associate professor of accounting at the NUS Business School, while Chris Bennett runs corporate governance training and advocacy firm, BPA.\n\nThey found that most of the largest listed companies consist of many group entities. The average number of group entities in the Australian, Malaysian and Singaporean companies were 93, 90 and 47, respectively, with the largest total number being 554 (Malaysia).\n\nThey also found that, in all three countries, group entities contribute significantly to the financial performance and financial position of company groups.\n\n\"Clearly, the performance and risks of group entities which are legally separate from, but often managerially integrated with, the listed entity will have a significant impact on the performance and risk of the listed entity and the individuals holding directorships in the group entities,\" said Mr Bennett.\n\nStill, the size and contribution of the group entity is not the only factor determining the magnitude of the risk it poses.\n\nThe head of audit in an unnamed Big Four accounting firm quoted in the report said: \"The larger the component is, the more attention you pay to those subsidiaries. The more insignificant they are, the less attention you pay to them, and that's where the problem comes . . . it could be small, but there is a lot of risk taking. . . A good example is Barings Bank. It was not a significant operation (in Singapore), but it became a significant contributor to risk taking.\"\n\nThe report also found that many company groups pay attention to the governance of their group entities only after a scandal or failure has occurred. The finance director of an unnamed multinational chemicals company was quoted in the report as saying: \"Bhopal (a massive gas leak at the Union Carbide India pesticide plant in Bhopal, India in 1984) was a big wake-up call to the major chemicals companies to pay more attention to subsidiaries.\"\n\nProf Mak and Mr Bennett say a pro-active approach to the governance of group entities is needed to minimise the risk of governance failures in group entities causing severe financial and reputational harm to the entire group.\n\nThey have proposed a framework in their report to guide the board and management of the ultimate parent company in considering the approach and the specific measures which should be adopted in governing group entities.\n\nThe framework includes suggestions on forming a formal group governance programme with a group-wide corporate governance framework/policy, a central database tracking all group entities and a head of group governance.\n\nOther suggestions include having a formal training programme for subsidiary directors, site visits by directors and senior executives of the parent, having a group-wide risk management framework, code of conduct and whistleblowing policy, and so on.\n\nThe authors say groups should also improve their disclosures of key measures put in place to ensure good governance of the entire group. Boards of the ultimate parent company should also ensure the governance of group entities is discussed and well-communicated throughout the group.\n\nRegulators also need to play their part. The report suggests regulators ought to review laws and regulations relating to the fiduciary duty of directors in groups, and consider the need to clarify it for directors of parent companies, subsidiaries and other group entities.\n\nIt also says regulators should recognise the need for laws and regulations imposing duties and responsibilities on boards of both parent companies and group entities, to be accompanied by adequate guidance to assist these boards to interpret these laws and regulations, thereby minimising inter-board conflicts.\n\nThe full report can be found on the CPA Australia website - '\n\nhttp://www.cpaaustralia.com.au/documents/governance-co-groups.pdf'\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He did not elaborate on the reason for the delay.\n\nTony Fernandes, owner and CEO of AirAsia, told reporters earlier that the airline would also invest more money in new planes to raise its scale in India, meaning it would miss its original October target for breaking even. He did not say how many more planes AirAsia would buy or give a figure for the investment.\n\nAirAsia now plans to sell three or four of its aircraft across its operations, down from the 12 it said it had wanted to sell in May, because of the demand it sees in Malaysia and India, Mr Fernandes added.\n\nAirAsia India, a three-way venture between the airline, India's Tata Group and investment firm Telestra Tradeplace, launched its debut flight on June 12.\n\nThe carrier will have to juggle some of the highest fuel costs in the region, an array of local and national taxes, and heavy price discounting by rivals desperate to win market share.\n\nThe fares price war is expected to intensify too, when Singapore Airlines Ltd's joint venture with the Tata Group starts flying in India later this year. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM", "images": []}

Tigerair Mandala's shareholders have decided to cease funding the Indonesia-based carrier, which shut down operations on July 1.\n\nCome September, SIA is expected to launch a full service carrier together with India's Tata in a bid to tap the growing Indian air travel market. But OCBC analysts Yap Kim Leng and Wong Teck Ching noted that the entry of the new airline will only add to the intense competition in India, where incumbents are already struggling to eke out a profit amid challenges such as high fuel taxes and limited infrastructure. IndiGo has been the only Indian carrier to consistently deliver a profit.\n\nThere might also be \"political inertia\" to scrap India's 5/20 rule, which requires an Indian carrier to be five years old and have a fleet of at least 20 planes before it can operate international flights. As such, the SIA-Tata joint venture runs the risk of being limited to domestic flights for five years, Mr Yap and Mr Wong reckon.\n\nMeanwhile, SIA's wholly owned subsidiary, bud-get carrier Scoot, is setting up a joint venture with Thailand's Nok Air called NokScoot, slated to take to the skies in 2H14. However, political uncertainty in Thailand could continue to put a damper on travel demand, while competition from rival Thai AirAsia X could result in a price war, which would hit profitability.\n\n\"SIA has been seeking new revenue through geographical expansion as well as ancillary sources, of which some will start contributing modestly in FY15,\" said the OCBC report, which has a fair value estimate of $9.50 on the stock.\n\nIt went on, however, to add that the \"initiatives' boost to profits in the current environment will be limited, if any at all\".\n\nThe counter gained 12 cents yesterday to close at $10.49.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In recent years, she's carved a comfortable niche by playing the glamour-free klutz and small-town girl with the plus-sized body and R-rated vocabulary with admirable verve and a good deal of voracity: what you see is what you get, and her characters simply tell it like it is.\n\nIn Tammy, a film conceived and written by McCarthy together with husband Ben Falcone (who also directed), she lays it all on the line by getting into the skin of the title character - an unflinching underdog who never met a cheeseburger (or three) she didn't like. The movie gives us a larger-than-life glimpse of lower-middle-class America, and it's not pretty.\n\nUnfortunately, Tammy is not very funny either. In Bridesmaids (2011) and to a lesser degree The Heat (2013), McCarthy proves she had a commanding screen presence and also displayed a knack for physical comedy. Here, she once again takes a page from the buddy-movie playbook and tweaks it until it hurts. The result is a mish-mash of comic scenes and random ideas: part road trip, part romantic comedy and all terribly out-of-sync.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Virgin will be the first European carrier to get the 787-9 variant of Boeing's newest widebody, with flights scheduled from October.\n\nAirbus's A350 is due for its first delivery, to Qatar Airways Ltd, later this year, while Boeing's 777X, a successor to its popular long-range twinjet, is slated to enter production in 2017 with service entry in 2020.\n\nAn order for Airbus A380 superjumbos has been put on hold, with delivery deferred until 2018 at the earliest, as Virgin mulls over whether it has room for the world's largest passenger jet.\n\nVirgin is already retiring comparatively inefficient Airbus A340-300s which are due to exit by the end of February, and -600s of which two are due to be retired at the beginning of the year. The last five 747-400s stationed at Heathrow are due to leave the fleet between September 2015 and July 2016.\n\nVirgin's revamp of crew uniforms comes as Mr Kreeger seeks to maintain its trendsetting status in the face of service enhancements at carriers spanning closest rival British Airways, pioneer of flat-bed seats, to Gulf operators such as Etihad Airways, which will offer enclosed suites in its A380s.\n\nDesigned by Vivienne Westwood, who found fame with her punk clothing in the 1970s in partnership with Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren, the uniforms will be worn by 7,500 cabin crew, pilots, lounge staff and Virgin Holidays employees.\n\n\"Every time we have a new uniform, other airlines start to emulate and copy, so we have to keep revamping,\" Mr Branson said in an interview at the London event. He declined to comment on plans for the interiors of the 787 Dreamliners, which will account for more than half of the fleet by 2018.\n\nThe relationship with new shareholder Delta helped halve Virgin Atlantic's 2013 loss to \u00a351 million (S$109 million) as sales gained 4.9 per cent to \u00a32.98 billion.\n\nMr Kreeger said he still aims to return the company to profit by the end of this fiscal year.\n\nBritish Airways, a unit of International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, boosted operating profit 73 per cent last year to \u00a3651 million. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM", "images": []}

Chinese developers also like its legal stability and status as a world city, giving them a platform to gain experience abroad and build brand awareness, industry watchers say.\n\n\"More and more Chinese developers are coming to Hong Kong,\" said Alvin Yip, managing director of investment and advisory services at property consultancy DTZ. \"They are not coming only for opportunities in Hong Kong, but also using Hong Kong as a base to invest in Europe, the United States and other parts of the world.\"\n\nIn Kai Tak district - one of Hong Kong's largest developments covering 320 hectares of residential and commercial complexes - half of the six available land plots were bought over the past year by state-owned developers, including China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd and Poly Property.\n\nWhile hard data is not yet available to quantify the trend, it is rare to see mainland developers so active in public auctions of Hong Kong land. Observers also have been surprised by the mainlanders' willingness to out-spend their Hong Kong rivals.\n\nIn May, a luxury residential site on Hong Kong island fetched the city's fifth-highest land price per square foot when it was sold to a consortium of local and mainland Chinese developers, including Hui Wing-mau, chairman of Shanghai-based Shimao Property Holdings', and mainland commercial developer Mingfa Group International.\n\n\"The premium price they (Chinese developers) offered surprised the market,\" said a senior executive at a Hong Kong property company, which was out-bid by state-owned developers in several land auctions. \"Chinese developers are more optimistic, while locals remain pessimistic due to uncertainty in the market,\" said the executive, who declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nChina Overseas Land declined to comment, while Poly did not respond to several interview requests.\n\nMainland investors are boosting their exposure to Hong Kong just as the city's homegrown developers have started to slow their own pace of site purchases, in response to rising land prices, sliding sales and pressure on margins from competition.\n\nHong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong (Holdings) did not buy anything in Hong Kong or China last year - for the first time in 15 years.\n\nAnother major Hong Kong-based developer, Sino Land Co Ltd, spent just HK$4.5 billion ($724 million) on land over the past two years, a slower rate of spending than normally would be expected, according to Macquarie. It also became a net cash developer, taking a conservative position by amassing enough cash to invest in future projects after total liabilities are accounted for.\n\nThe local firms' caution has opened opportunities for mainland rivals seeking a more stable investment environment than they have at home, where the government has introduced a raft of regulations to control rampant speculation.\n\nChina has spent more than four years trying to tame record home prices on concerns that they were stoking an asset bubble, with measures including strict rules for mortgages and restrictions on the number of homes that one family can own. Banks have made it harder for home buyers and small developers to get loans.\n\n\"We always have full confidence in Hong Kong.

The delay in releasing its full year results by end-June was due to the company's inability to finalise the carrying value of its assets and liabilities, said Signature Metals in an announcement to the ASX which was released by LionGold on the Singapore Exchange yesterday. For this, Signature is now sorting out its funding requirements with majority shareholder LionGold.\n\nIt said: \"Management is doing all that is necessary to expedite the finalisation of the accounts, in order that it may make the required lodgements.\"\n\nSignature Metals's flagship operation is 70 per cent-owned Owere Mines, which wholly owns Konongo Project - a gold-mining concession in Ghana.\n\nLionGold has until end-October - it was granted a three-month extension by SGX - to hold its annual general meeting for the financial year ended March 2014.\n\nAt the heart of these delays is that LionGold itself has not been able to complete the full audit of its FY2014 results.\n\nOne factor is the need for time to reassess key assumptions following the fall in gold prices which has led to some revisions in the firm's investments in its mining assets.\n\nLionGold shares gained 0.1 of a cent, or 1.15 per cent, to end at 8.8 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Valuations have come back to a more attractive level following rotation driven correction in Q1 when people escaped from high price-to-earnings stocks to low price-to-earnings (PE) stocks,\" she told The Business Times in an interview.\n\n\"As we see the equity market transit from a liquidity-driven to a growth-driven market, and the tech sector continues to deliver earnings growth in the low teens, it is quite attractive given current PEs of around 12,\" she said.\n\nTech companies providing information technology (IT) infrastructure to businesses are better positioned to benefit from increased corporate spending, she said.\n\nAccording to Credit Suisse's July 2014 \"Investment Monthly\" research note, recommended tech stocks include German enterprise software multinational SAP, Swedish IT infrastructure provider Ericsson, smartphone giant Apple, social media company Facebook and Chinese Internet firm Tencent.\n\nAmong defensive stocks, the healthcare sector stands out, Ms Fan said. Defensive stocks refer to those that will make money regardless of the economic cycle, such as consumer staples.\n\nThree things she looks for in healthcare companies are their product development capabilities, whether they have market share, and whether they have strong balance sheets.\n\nIntensifying mergers and acquisitions activity would also keep sector valuations relatively high, she said.\n\nPharmaceutical giants like Novartis and Roche are among stocks recommended by Credit Suisse research. Biotech stocks recommended include Abb-Vie, BioMarin and Gilead Sciences.\n\nIn Asia, India remains an \"outperform\" pick despite a run-up from the landslide election of the party of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\n\"I think we're still far from the peak ... the Sensex 12-month forward PE is just trading at the 10-year historical average,\" Ms Fan said.\n\nTaiwan, with its tech-oriented market, will benefit the most from a recovery in developed markets, she said.\n\nChina might offer the steepest discount to historical averages. But that discount is underpinned by an economic slowdown and a concern that high local government debt will cause a systemic crisis, she said.\n\nRenewed investor concern could also arise as trust funds enter their peak repayment season in the first half of 2015, she said.\n\nChina indices are also dominated by stocks from the inefficient industrial sector, which is suffering from overcapacity, she said. \"The bright spot is going to be the underdeveloped services sector.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But it's very difficult to fight against what is done behind the scenes.\"\n\nMr Valcke's comments came after German magazine Der Spiegel claimed that the Group A match between Cameroon and Croatia on June 18 was fixed. The magazine alleged that Cameroon agreed with a betting ring before the match to lose 4-0. Days later, Fifa revealed that the clash between Cameroon and Brazil on June 23 was at risk of being rigged.

Since that takeover, the bonds secured by the ship have soared 35 per cent to 115 cents on the dollar, almost seven times the average gain for Mexican corporate debt.\n\nThe trustee is now moving to liquidate the ship to compensate bondholders, tacking on penalties and missed interest payments to the payout amount. Estimated to be worth US$245 million as recently as last year, the ship could fetch a price that would be more than enough to cover the US$160 million of defaulted bonds. While there's still a risk that Mexico might try to claim the ship as an Oceanografia asset amid criminal probes, investors are betting the sale will go through.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM", "images": []}

This effectively killed P3. The unexpected collapse of P3 raises practical issues for the companies involved and also wider questions for the liner shipping industry.\n\nMoller-Maersk chief executive Nils Andersen was quoted as saying that the Chinese decision came as a surprise, but said the company wasn't planning a strategic shift as a result. \"We have delivered very good results on a standalone basis, and there are no reasons why we should not continue,\" he said, adding that he didn't rule out smaller alliances, or capacity adjustments, in the wake of the P3 rejection.\n\nMediterranean Shipping said it would review its options related to cost efficiencies and services. \"We could have achieved these efficiencies much faster through P3,\" said company vice-president Diego Aponte.\n\nMeanwhile, CMA CGM said it was confident that it would maintain its operating performance despite the P3 rejection.\n\nPhilip Wareham, head of EU & Competition Team at London-based legal firm Hill Dickinson, noted in an online commentary that the decision by the Chinese antitrust authority responsible for mergers, Mofcom, has sent shock waves through the shipping industry worldwide and led to a fall in AP Moller-Maersk's share price.\n\nMr Wareham said the industry reaction has essentially been one of huge surprise, as the working assumption was that - as the US and EU had each looked at the proposals and not vetoed them - it was safe to assume that Mofcom would follow suit.\n\nHe observed, however, that the case raises an important issue for all multinational businesses: how to manage global risk in a world where the standards are not uniform and there is uneven - and, in some cases, arbitrary - enforcement. \"The P3 Alliance is, in a sense, a good test case for the proponents and opponents of greater harmonisation of antitrust law to argue over,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Mr Wareham, the decisive point seemed to be that, under Chinese law, the alliance was regarded as a merger and - while Mofcom's practice in merger cases largely follows established competition law principles - the law permits several non-antitrust factors to be considered. Such factors include the \"public interest\", market efficiency and the failing-firm defence. \"This inevitably gave Mofcom a broad margin of discretion when it came to assessing the impact which the alliance would have in China,\" he added.\n\nBut Mr Wareham also pointed to the tentative nature of the acceptance of the P3 Alliance by US and EU authorities. In the US, the FMC (Federal Maritime Commission) merely had to rule out the possibility of the alliance being likely - as a result of a reduction in competition - to produce an \"unreasonable\" decrease in transportation services or increase in transportation costs. That is as far as it went in \"approving\" P3 and, at the same time, it called for the situation to be kept under constant review.\n\nAnti-competitive\n\nIn the EU, to intervene, the European Commission had to satisfy itself that there was something anti-competitive happening that merited further investigation - which, said Mr Wareham, \"it was hardly in a position to do before the alliance had begun operating and before its full impact could be measured\".\n\nHe said that it remained to be seen what the parties to the P3 Alliance and their competitors would do next, but it was clear that size matters, and the very size and degree of integration of the P3 Alliance meant that Mofcom was not prepared to give it the benefit of the doubt.\n\nGlobal Shippers' Council (GSF) secretary- general Chris Welsh had expressed concern about P3 from the outset. He commented: \"The unprecedented size and scale that the proposed P3 Global Alliance was going to pose competition regulators was a concern to the GSF. We had welcomed the recent monitoring arrangements for the proposals, but the P3 appears to have failed the legal hurdles under Chinese competition law, which we always recognised was likely to be both an unknown factor and problematic.\"\n\nHard on the heels of the Mofcom decision, however, the European Commission made a decision that has pleased the shipping lines: the Commission announced that the validity of EU rules which exempt liner shipping consortia that have a market share of up to 30 per cent from EU antitrust rules will be extended until April 2020.\n\nCommenting on the move, Patrick Verhoeven, secretary-general of the European Community Shipowners' Associations (ECSA), said: \"We warmly welcome the European Commission's decision as it is fully in line with our reasoning. The extension of the liner BER (Block Exemption Regulation) will greatly benefit liner shipping by allowing for the continuation of a legal framework that has so far proved its usefulness. The rules provide clarity, transparency and legal certainty, which the liner shipping industry needs in these testing times.\"\n\nMr Verhoeven made his views quite clear saying: \"Liner Shipping Consortia increase competition, improve services rendered and foster innovation in a time of rising fuel prices, economic stagnation, stricter environmental rules and a relentless cost-cutting exercise that carriers have undertaken to remain afloat. The Commission's decision is praiseworthy as it removes legal uncertainty from the equation. By doing so, it allows operators to enter or leave consortia agreements based solely on market realities, thus serving the best interest of shippers and carriers, but most importantly, of the consumer.\"\n\nThose comments may raise some hackles in the shipper community but actually Mr Verhoeven misses the main (and most controversial) reason why slot-sharing alliances are good things. To an extent, they put a brake on ordering and curb the industry's inherent tendency to create too much capacity. They are nowhere as effective in doing this as the old liner conferences when managing capacity was really what they were all about.\n\nKeeping the EU exemption is a good thing but whether the carriers can ever start to make decent returns on the huge capital invested in modern liner shipping remains to be seen.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Frasers shares lost 0.3 per cent to $1.895 in Singapore.\n\nSince proposing to bid for the Sydney-based company last month, Frasers has completed due diligence and will move forward with its A$4.48 a share offer to acquire all Australand securities, the companies said in regulatory filings on Tuesday.\n\nThe acquisition would give Frasers control of Australand's A$2.3 billion of office and industrial properties and A$9.3 billion of developments in Australia, where the Singapore company is building the 2,000-apartment Central Park project in downtown Sydney. For shareholders of Australand, it offers a better payout than bids from domestic competitors Stockland and GPT Group received over the past 18 months.\n\n\"Some of the other offers were reasonable, but the board of Australand was cognisant of growing demand,\" said Tony Sherlock, Sydney-based head of property research at Morningstar Australasia Pty. \"They've done a very good job extracting maximum value for investors.\"\n\nThe bid's success is still dependent on acceptances from more than 50 per cent of Australand shareholders and approval from Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board, according to the statement. The offer is scheduled to open on July 7 and close on Aug 7 unless extended, Frasers said.\n\nUnder the proposal, Australand shareholders would retain their expected first-half dividend of 12.75 Australian cents per share, the statement showed.\n\n\"The due diligence affirms the rationale and strategic fit for Frasers to acquire Australand,\" Frasers chief executive officer Lim Ee Seng said in the company's statement on Tuesday. \"Frasers had planned on achieving several key strategic objectives over the medium term, including increasing the proportion of overseas earnings and recurring income as well as enhancing our platform in Australia.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nNvidia to resume H20 AI chip sales to China in US reversal\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nIndonesia looking at levy on coal exports to boost state coffers\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:03 PM\n\nAsia: Markets mixed as China\u2019s economy meets forecasts\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:49 AM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nFCT extends Northpoint City South Wing management by a year\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:28 AM\n\nChina\u2019s quant funds boost US recruiting after Trump\u2019s visa curbs\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nGold holds ground with spotlight on US inflation data\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:51 AM", "images": []}

In Wenzhou, DoThink Group is offering to repurchase homes at three of its projects for 120 per cent of the purchase price after three years.\n\nThe offers are the latest strategy by developers across China, including reducing prices, delaying project launches and offering incentives to potential buyers, as they seek to maintain sales targets. Prices of new homes fell in May from April in half the 70 cities tracked by the government, the largest proportion since May 2012, according to government data. A more persistent and sharper downturn in the property sector is the biggest risk for China's economy in the next couple of years, according to UBS.\n\n\"Obviously they're relatively cash-thirsty,\" said Dai Fang, a Shanghai-based analyst at Zheshang Securities. \"If it works, there surely will be other developers following suit.\"\n\nChina's home sales slumped 10.2 per cent in the first five months of this year from the same period a year earlier amid tight credit and an economic slowdown, reversing last year's 27 per cent jump. The average new-home price in 100 cities tracked by SouFun Holdings fell 0.5 per cent in June from the previous month, accelerating from the 0.3 per cent decline in May that ended 23 consecutive months of gains.\n\nFor closely held Shanheng Real Estate, which is controlled by Shanghai-based clothing maker Shanshan Group, the buyback offer helped attract more than 1,000 potential buyers to its Yishanjun project, meaning \"mountainside homes\" in Chinese, a half-hour drive from downtown Hangzhou during the three-day Dragon Boat Festival holiday that ended on June 2.\n\nMore than 50 of the at least 100 units eligible for the buyback were sold, exceeding the project's total sales in the first five months of the year combined, according to the company's president Xiao Jixiao.\n\n\"The five-year buyback helped a lot of people who wanted to buy make up their minds,\" Mr Xiao told Zhejiang Online, according to a video posted on the news website affiliated with the Communist Party's local commission in the eastern province of Zhejiang. \"The purchasing power in the market remains very strong.\"\n\nThe Shanghai-based developer declined to comment when contacted.\n\nYishanjun is selling at an average price of 7,000 yuan (S$1,405) a square metre, down from 9,000 yuan last year, according to sales information on Sohu.com Inc's real estate website.\n\nNew-home prices in Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang province and popular with tourists for its West Lake, fell 1.4 per cent in May from April amid high inventories, the biggest decline among the 70 Chinese cities tracked by the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nSlowing sales in Hangzhou are already hurting some of the city's other developers. Standard & Poor's cut Zhong An Real Estate's long-term corporate credit rating to B- from B in a June 27 report, citing \"worsening operating conditions\", particularly in the developer's biggest market of Hangzhou that are likely to weaken cash flows.\n\nHangzhou-based DoThink Group said that it is offering to buy back more than 200 apartments in Wenzhou, ranging from 70 square metres to 190 square metres, through private equity unit Kylin Investment Management.\n\nThe closely held developer has built more than 10 million square meters of homes and office buildings since 1993.\n\n\"Many developers have tried various marketing methods to get cash back, but they all missed the root cause\" of falling home sales, Kylin's chief executive officer Huang Dong said. \"The key is lack of confidence and the uncertain outlook\" of the property market.\n\nA Kylin-managed fund will sign agreements to buy back homes after buyers pay the full price and hold the property for three years, a measure that can prop up confidence in the value of the properties, Mr Huang said.\n\nThe company raised 200 million yuan in May from investors for a three-year property fund that will agree to buy the apartments at 120 per cent of the current selling price, he said. That level is still profitable because the projects' land and construction costs were low after the local property market declined in the past few years, enabling the projects to be priced competitively, Mr Huang said.\n\nThe average new-home price in Wenzhou, known for pioneering local entrepreneurs, has slumped 35 per cent since its peak in November 2011 after a thriving underground lending market collapsed, while the national average climbed 12 per cent in the period, according to SouFun, China's biggest real estate website owner.\n\nPrices in Beijing jumped 40 per cent during the period and surged 19 per cent in Shanghai, according to SouFun.\n\n\"Given rising sales pressure, we expect developers to offer more attractive pricing\" in the second half of the year, Barclays's Hong Kong-based property analysts led by Alvin Wong wrote in a report on June 24.\n\nContracted sales as at May 31 at 28 developers tracked by Barclays accounted for only 30 per cent of their full-year targets, suggesting they can only complete 36 per cent in the first half, \"significantly lower\" than the 47 per cent a year earlier, the analysts wrote in a June 12 report.\n\nA gauge tracking Shanghai-listed real estate companies fell 0.4 per cent at the market close, extending this year's decline to 6.2 per cent.\n\nShanghai Yuehe Real Estate's construction of mixed-use residential and commercial project in the city was halted last month after the closely held company couldn't find sufficient funds, and the project was frozen by a court, two government officials familiar with the matter said last week.\n\nAbout 190 kilometres away in the eastern city of Fenghua, Zhejiang Xingrun Real Estate Co became insolvent in March with 3.5 billion yuan in debt, and its founder was detained for illegal fundraising, a local official said at the time.\n\nTo combat the weaker market in Guangzhou, in the southern province of Guangdong, almost 20 housing developments rolled out no-down-payment plans to boost sales, Nanfang Daily, Guangdong's official Communist Party newspaper, reported in April, as government agencies in Guangzhou and Shenzhen issued warnings against the practice.\n\nChina's property market downturn this time will be more prolonged than the last two corrections, Tom Byrne, a senior vice-president at Moody's Investors Service, said at a conference in Shanghai on June 19. A 10 per cent drop in property sales and building construction will lower the country's economic growth rate to between 5 per cent and 6 per cent, he said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nChina\u2019s June new home prices fall at fastest monthly pace in eight months\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM", "images": []}

But the railway-built hotels that era left behind have retained much of that period's glory and glamour.\n\nNow a decision by Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge, which is owned by Quebec's largest investment fund, to largely eliminate hotels from its holdings has put a handful of Canada's most famous landmarks on the market.\n\nFirst to go last year was the Fairmont Chateau Laurier in Ottawa, a turreted, stone-clad castle that was home to some prime ministers and which is often assumed by some tourists to be part of the neighbouring Parliament buildings.\n\nThe ivy-clad Fairmont Empress in Victoria, British Columbia (BC), was sold last week to a real estate developer, Nat Bosa and his wife Flora.\n\nThat leaves two hotels on the market: the Fairmont Royal York, once the largest hotel in the British Empire, which still commands part of Toronto's skyline, and the Fairmont Hotel Vancouver in BC's largest city.\n\n\"A lot of buyers see this as an opportunity to have a hotel that tells a story beyond its returns,\" said S\u00e9bastien Th\u00e9berge, a spokesman for Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge, of Montreal. \"There's a lot of pride in these properties.\"\n\nThe hotels are such integral parts of their cities, he said, that his company broke with its usual practice of not announcing sales until they closed to avoid igniting panicked rumours about their fates.\n\nLike the Chateau Laurier, many of Canada's railway hotels were designed, to varying degrees, to resemble castles. Harold Kalman, an architectural historian based in Vancouver, said that stemmed largely from a decision by William Van Horne, the general manager and later president of the Canadian Pacific Railway, who was also an amateur architect.\n\nThe hotels owned by the rival Canadian National railroad further raised their profiles by hosting Canada's first public radio stations. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp moved its Ottawa radio studios out of the two top floors of the Chateau Laurier only 10 years ago. Yousuf Karsh, an early photographer of the wealthy and famous, lived and kept a studio in the hotel.\n\nCombined with their central locations, Mr Kalman said, \"there are probably dozens of connections where the community can actually be linked to the hotel.\" He noted that when he married for a second time in Ottawa, the reception was held at the Chateau Laurier. \"We really didn't think of any other place,\" he said.\n\nFairmont Hotels and Resorts, which still manages most of the Canadian railway hotels, is directly descended from the hotel operation Mr Van Horne established at Canadian Pacific. It was spun off by the railway in 2001, and six years later it sold most of its Canadian properties, including the batch that went to Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge.\n\nMr Th\u00e9berge said that a strategic review after a change in senior management led Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge to get out of the hotel business in the belief that better returns could be found in other real estate sectors. At the peak in 2009, Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge owned more than 70 hotel properties worldwide. Now it is down to nine.\n\nThe real estate company, which is owned by Caisse de D\u00e9p\u00f4t et Placement du Qu\u00e9bec, will keep three of those properties: Fairmont Le Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac, which looms over Quebec City and hosted meetings between Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill during World War II; Fairmont the Queen Elizabeth, which sits across from a major office complex that Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge owns in Montreal; and W Montr\u00e9al, which is adjacent to the real estate company's headquarters and in which it has a 51 per cent interest.\n\nBecause of their status, Mr Th\u00e9berge said, the hotels were being sold through a special process. Fairmont retains a final say in any sale and buyers must show that they have the means and commitment to invest in the properties, which, as is the case with the Empress, can be more than a century old.\n\n\"These properties require constant love,\" he said. Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge just spent C$75 million (S$87.9 million), on repairs and renovations to the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac.\n\nMr Bosa, the president of Bosa Development, which is based in the Vancouver suburb Burnaby, said that he first looked at the Empress with an eye towards putting condominiums along part of Victoria's scenic waterfront. But when he walked through the hotel's doors for the first time, he said: \"I fell in love with an old mistress. It was not my traditional real estate deal. This is a true love attraction and we're going to do the right thing.\"\n\nMany of the other railway hotels once owned by Fairmont went to the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System through its subsidiary, the Oxford Properties Group, in 2007. While it has no plans to get out of hotels, in May it did sell 65,000 largely undeveloped acres in Quebec that came with Fairmont Le Ch\u00e2teau Montebello, a massive log structure on the Ottawa River, for about C$50 million. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

We can see this area becoming mature in five years,\" he said.\n\n\"It takes time, but eventually it will be a good location,\" he added.\n\nCapitaLand's 21.1 billion yuan (S$4.2 billion) investment in an 817,000 sq m gross floor area (GFA) mixed-development project in Chongqing in 2011, named Raffles City Chongqing, was the Singapore property giant's biggest in China to date.\n\nIts land cost was 6.54 billion yuan, or roughly 8,000 yuan per sq m on GFA. The site of its purchase is Chongqing's historic Chaotianmen area at the confluence of the Yangtze and Jialing rivers.\n\nDue to open in 2017, the development includes a shopping mall and eight towers for residential, serviced apartment and hotel use. It was designed by architect Moshe Safdie, who also designed the Marina Bay Sands complex.\n\nMeanwhile, Everbright together with Zhe Shang group bought its site for around 7,000 yuan per sq m on GFA, off public auction, at a roughly 10 to 15 per cent discount to what CapitaLand paid, Mr Pan said. The group is building an office building right behind the CapitaLand site, called Zhe Shang Da Sha, or Zhe Shang building.\n\nBT understands that the site's lower price, compared to the CapitaLand site, is because the two plots are zoned differently. The CapitaLand site is zoned residential and commercial, while the Everbright site is just zoned commercial.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However, its growth forecast for emerging economies stands at 4.6 per cent this year, down from 4.7 per cent a year ago.\n\nRichard Jerram, chief economist of Bank of Singapore, said: \"This year, global growth is going to be the best since 2011. Next year is going to be fairly similar - it's not going to be wildly rapid, but it's going to be solid and healthy.\"\n\nThe bank expects the US Fed to hike interest rates in 2Q 2015, earlier than previous estimates for the second half of next year.\n\nChina would be an area of concern moving forward, Mr Jerram said. \"There's a huge credit bubble, you've got credit expansion of 70 per cent of GDP (gross domestic product) in the space of five years,\" he said, noting that it is higher than the International Monetary Fund's benchmarks in a typical banking crisis.\n\n\"There should be a better than even probability that they are going to have a banking crisis, because this credit has been funding inefficient investment, and inefficient investment is not going to service the debt,\" Mr Jerram said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The mixed nature of last month's manufacturing performance - where overall PMI dipped while electronics PMI rose - has left economists grappling with what may come next.\n\nDBS economist Irvin Seah told The Business Times: \"With June's readings, we really don't get a clear sign of where the overall manufacturing sector is heading. There is no clear upward or downward trend, and things are just running sideways.\"\n\nBy keeping above the 50-point threshold that separates expansion from contraction, June's PMI still signalled growth in the manufacturing sector, despite falling short of expectations.

If we get 3.5 to 4 per cent rebound (in Q2 GDP), we'd expect the Fed to sound a bit more hawkish,\" he said in an interview yesterday.\n\nMr Wade was weighing in on a key debate in markets on when interest rates will rise. Rising rates have the potential to destabilise financial markets, like they did in the third quarter of last year.\n\nHere, he made his argument in part by using the jobs calculator on the Atlanta Federal Reserve's webpage.\n\nCurrently, at a 6.3 per cent unemployment rate and a 35-year-low labour force participation rate of 62.8 per cent, just 98,000 jobs need to be created every month to maintain the unemployment rate at that level in a year's time.\n\nThe current pace of US job creation, however, is more than 200,000 jobs a month.\n\nGiven a similar pace of job creation, the unemployment rate would be 5.5 per cent in a year's time at end-Q2 2015.\n\nThis number is already at the lower end of current Fed projections for an end-2015 unemployment rate of 5.4 to 5.7 per cent.\n\nBut Mr Wade thinks the unemployment rate will be even lower because more people are dropping out of the workforce than coming in.\n\n\"There will be some effect of people coming into the market (with the economic recovery), but the bigger effect is the retirement of baby boomers,\" he said.\n\n\"The argument is that people have delayed their retirement with the financial crisis, but now that markets have recovered, it is a good opportunity to retire.\"\n\nIf the labour force participation rate, which has declined from its peak of 67 per cent in the late 1990s to 62.8 per cent now, declines to 62 per cent, just 48,000 jobs need to be created a month for the unemployment rate to be at 5.5 per cent in a year's time.\n\nWith more people getting hired and less people in the workforce to be hired, wages are going to go up. That will cause a rise in inflation that will lead to the Fed wanting to act to cool down the economy through a rate rise, he said. Rate rises increase the cost of borrowing and act to dampen inflationary pressures.\n\nAccording to the Taylor rule, an influential monetary policy rule that determines where interest rates should be given inflation and economic output, interest rates should already be more than 2 per cent instead of zero to 0.25 per cent now.\n\nThe Taylor rule worked from the 1990s until the 2009 crisis, when the deep recession caused theoretical rates to go negative. Now, the Taylor rule is suggesting positive interest rates again, Mr Wade noted.\n\nInvestors, however, are betting the Fed will ignore the Taylor rule and interest rates will stay low. US 10-year Treasury yields have notably declined from 3 per cent at the beginning of the year to 2.56 per cent now.\n\nCurrency carry trades are making a comeback. This refers to borrowing in a low-yield currency such as the US dollar or euro and investing in a high-yield currency such as in Indonesia or Turkey.\n\nBut Mr Wade cautioned that if central banks keep sending out the message that rates will stay low, investors will borrow too much to fund their carry trades. When rates inch up, they will rush to unwind the trades they made, destabilising the high-yielding emerging markets.\n\nMr Wade thinks the danger of leveraged carry trades is just beginning to arise. \"There was such a big shakeout last year and everybody scrambled for the exit. Now, people are beginning to go back in again.\"\n\nEmerging markets (EM) generally look interesting to him, and Schroders has been rotating its money into Asian economies such as South Korea, Taiwan and some China H-shares.\n\nBut the catalyst for a rally is missing. EM export growth has yet to recover despite a developed markets recovery, he said.\n\nAnd some countries, notably Turkey, South Africa, Indonesia, India and Brazil, are still reliant on external funding and vulnerable to a US rate hike.\n\nHaving said that, Japan and Asian exporters such as South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the Philippines are attractive, he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The total market capitalisation of that sector stood at S$214 billion, translating to about 20 per cent of Singapore's total market value. All in, the sector's market value rose S$8.3 billion, or 4.1 per cent.\n\nThe second-largest sector by market value is that of commerce, with the market cap of trade-related firms making up just over 15 per cent of Singapore's total market cap.\n\nDBS, which will report its second-quarter results today, made the largest gains in its market cap among all Singapore-listed companies in dollar terms. This was up 8.8 per cent - or S$3.6 billion - to S$44.9 billion.\n\nUOB, which reported a better-than-expected results for its second quarter yesterday, had further heft added to its market value.\n\nThe stock gained S$2.6 billion - representing a 7.3 per cent increase in value - to finish with a market cap of S$39 billion.\n\nOCBC, which this week announced that it would fully take over Hong Kong's Wing Hang Bank, gained S$1.5 billion or 4.5 per cent in market cap to finish the month with S$34.9 billion.\n\nMost of the share overhang due to concerns over the purchase of Wing Hang has been lifted, with analysts waiting for details on the fund-raising structure. OCBC will report its results next Tuesday.\n\nTop losers in dollar terms include SIA Engineering. The stock lost S$438 million in value - or 7.8 per cent - to end with a market cap of S$5.2 billion.\n\nThe company, which provides ground handling services and aircraft cabin equipment, reported this month a 23 per cent slide in net profit for its first fiscal quarter, due to weak contributions from associates and joint ventures.\n\nSingapore also ushered in six listings - two on the mainboard and four on Catalist - in July.

This is unchanged from a year ago.\n\nThe results were reported before the markets opened.\n\nGreat Eastern shares closed up 10 Singapore cents to S$22.93 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The report said the FAA still had to confront so many hurdles that it was unclear when - or if - remotely controlled aircraft could be safely integrated into the nation's airspace.\n\nIn 2012, Congress passed a law that effectively legalised commercial and civilian drone flights in the United States. With backing from drone manufacturers and other businesses eager to embrace a new era in aviation, lawmakers directed the FAA to come up with rules and standards to permit widespread drone traffic by Sept 30, 2015.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM", "images": []}

They're aiming to get ahead of a market reversal that could be unpleasant once the Fed starts raising interest rates, probably next year.\n\n\"Valuations are getting stretched,\" said Jack Flaherty, investment manager at GAM, part of GAM Holding AG, a publicly listed Swiss company with more than US$120 billion in assets. \"You'd rather be early in getting out because when it does turn, it could be more violent than expected.\"\n\nBonds had a solid start to 2014, with the Barclays US Aggregate Index returning about 3.8 per cent for the first six months of the year. Interest from overseas investors and pensions has kept flows into fixed income funds strong.\n\nThat has reduced the extra premium investors are willing to pay to hold these bonds instead of the safer US Treasuries. This premium, or spread, is now at its lowest since 2007, and suggests confidence in the prospects of the US corporation issuing the debt.\n\nGAM has pared its US high-yield bond holdings, and plans to cut back more over the next few months. It has re-allocated to emerging market local debt and convertible bonds - debt that can be converted into shares of stock.\n\nMr Flaherty is concerned that after the Fed raises rates, liquidity could be a big problem because of Wall Street brokerages' reduced presence in the corporate bond market.\n\nIn the past, big banks could be counted on to make it easier to buy and sell bonds because of their sizeable inventory. But new rules have made it more costly to hold such assets.\n\nStandish Mellon Asset Management in Boston, which overseas US$160 million in fixed-income assets, has re-allocated to New Zealand and Australian bonds, as well as US Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), which rally if inflation rises.\n\nPrudential Fixed Income, with about US$418 billion of assets under management, has also reduced its risk in the past month.\n\nWith volatility low, a selloff seems unlikely now, said Marty Fridson, one of Wall Street's high-yield experts who is now chief investment officer at Lehmann, Livian, Fridson Advisors in New York. \"The Fed will not raise interest rates until 2015. So until then, investors don't have to worry about it.\"\n\nDecent returns are still possible in the corporate bond space, said GAM's Mr Flaherty. \"And when that's over, people say they can get out in time.

It's little wonder then that cities are in a race to become \"smart\", partly by using technology to tackle problems commonly associated with rapid urbanisation, such as environmental degradation. Some have set modest goals, such as smart parking lot management to ease congestion in city centres. Others are aiming higher; they want to use technology to transform the way they provide services to their people. Singapore belongs to this category. As Yaacob Ibrahim, Minister for Communications and Information, said recently, Singapore aims to be not just a smart city but a Smart Nation, one that uses technology to transform the quality of life in the country.\n\nThe picturesque Jurong Lake District is the test bed for 15 \"smart\" solutions that will be rolled out islandwide once they are validated. The framework for these solutions comprises sensors, video cameras and above-ground boxes that house a range of data-gathering devices. The data will result in benefits such as real-time traffic-signal phasing that responds to vehicular and pedestrian traffic volume and smart queuing which directs taxis to stands with more people waiting, and also helps to prevent illegal parking. It would also help monitor energy consumption, potentially turning every structure into a \"green\" building. Advances in sensors and networks are allowing the collection of unprecedented amounts of data - so-called \"big data\". In turn, smart analytics is providing actionable information in real time that makes services such as those being tested in Jurong feasible.

Brazil's stepped up spraying of insecticides didn't seem to help matters.\n\nNow Brazil is developing a more powerful weapon that may be ready when it hosts the 2016 Summer Olympics: genetically modified mosquitoes that self-destruct before doing any damage.\n\nBrazil will probably be the first country to approve large-scale releases of male mosquitoes with a lethal gene that causes their offspring to die before reaching adulthood, according to Hadyn Parry, chief executive of Oxitec Ltd, a UK biotechnology company that developed the technology.\n\n\"I'm hopeful it comes through this year,\" Mr Parry said. \"It would be an opportunity to use the occasion of the Olympics to say, 'Why don't we actually solve this problem?'\"\n\nThe soccer World Cup, which runs through July 13, has brought thousands of visitors to a country with the world's largest incidence of dengue. A heatwave has extended the mosquito season and fans have been urged to use repellent and wear long-sleeved clothing in the early morning and late afternoon.\n\n\"They were pretty thick in open spaces,\" particularly near the Manaus stadium in the Amazon rainforest region, Mr Quinn said.\n\nDengue, for which there is no vaccine or treatment, causes flu-like illness that can develop into potentially fatal complications. Warning signs include bleeding gums, vomiting, rapid breathing and severe abdominal pain.\n\nMore than 50 million people are infected a year, with about 500,000 requiring hospitalisation, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates.\n\nThe incidence of dengue has grown \"dramatically\" in recent years, and more than 40 per cent of the global population is at risk, according to the WHO.\n\nOxitec's technique eradicated almost all wild mosquitoes in a test in one small area in Brazil. The company is awaiting final regulatory approval to start selling the insects in Brazil, meaning relief is in sight for the Olympics, Mr Parry said.\n\nNew tools to fight dengue are emerging elsewhere. Drugmakers including Sanofi, Takeda Pharmaceutical Co and Merck & Co are racing to develop the first vaccine.\n\nAnother preventative technique, developed at Monash University in Melbourne and backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, will soon be tested in Australia and Indonesia. It blocks transmission to humans by injecting the Wolbachia bacteria in mosquitoes. When the insects mate, they spread the bacteria, making more mosquitoes unable to transmit dengue.\n\n\"Our approach is almost like a vaccine for the mosquito rather than for the human,\" Scott O'Neill, the Monash professor leading the non-profit Eliminate Dengue project, said.\n\nThe researchers will deploy mosquitoes in Townsville, Australia, in October and in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, next year, Prof O'Neill said. Regulatory approval has also been secured in Vietnam, China, Brazil and Colombia, he said.\n\n\"Many more of these amazing mosquitoes will need to be released into the wild in the months ahead before we can assess the impact,\" Microsoft founder Bill Gates wrote in an April blog post in which he described offering up his arm to a cage of Wolbachia mosquitoes for them to feast on human blood to develop eggs. \"It was a small price to pay for an amazing project that has the potential to turn the tide against a terrible disease.\"\n\nThe new approaches contrast with spraying insecticides and other methods that have proven ineffective in thwarting the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries dengue.\n\nOxitec's method is similar to some techniques that have successfully controlled other types of insects, said Duane Gubler, a professor of emerging infectious diseases at the Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School in Singapore.\n\n\"I am enthusiastic\" about Oxitec's solution, said Prof Gubler, author of a textbook on dengue. \"For the past 40 years, we have failed to control dengue. We simply haven't had the tools.\"\n\nOxitec won approval for its mosquito in April from Brazil's biosecurity commission, which regulates transgenic organisms, and has built a factory in Campinas, near Sao Paolo, Mr Parry said. Final clearance will specify who the company can sell to, such as local authorities or private operators.\n\nUntil the modified mosquitoes arrive, Prof Gubler recommends prevention. His best advice?

But Japan, which does have a substantial financial asset market, has jumped right in with its own mega QE programme.\n\nThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) is now discovering to its cost, however, that one man's medicine can be another man's poison where QE is concerned and that the success or otherwise of QE remedies depends upon the nature of the ailment which they are intended to cure.\n\nIf that ailment is a financial system crisis, a slump in economic activity and rising unemployment (as was the case in the US), QE can work. Restoring liquidity to the system can foster growth and jobs - but only in cases where \"supply side\" factors can be adjusted to meet the demand side.\n\nThe trouble in Japan's case, however, is that though nominally a market model like that of the US, the Japanese economy is much less flexible. Supply side factors such as labour markets, wages and the response to price signals do not move smoothly in sync with demand.\n\nThe QE (or quantitative and qualitative easing, QQE, to be precise) exercise launched by BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda in March 2013 was not designed to deal with a financial system crisis but with the chronic deflation that had plagued the Japanese economy for some two decades.\n\nThe objective was to increase liquidity, thus driving up prices and inflation expectations, spurring consumption and investment in the process. But when too much money is chasing sclerotic supply, inflation responses can produce nasty surprises.\n\nThe BOJ may have underestimated the impact of structural rigidities in Japan's economy. The result is a build-up of inflationary pressures that could go beyond the bank's 2 per cent annual inflation goal.\n\nThis in turn could cause interest rates to rise to a point where they stymie economic growth and create hazards for the government bond market. Unless and until structural blockages such as labour shortages are eased, supply will not respond to higher demand.\n\nQE was never likely to be a panacea for all economic ills and the greater the quantity of money injected into the economy by central banks, the greater the risk of accidents such as unexpected inflation, asset bubbles, rising interest rates and bond market turbulence.\n\nFormer BOJ governors argued that the supply side must be fixed before the demand side could be pumped up, yet this never happened in a change-resistant Japanese economy. Mr Kuroda's desire to give the process a shove from the monetary side was understandable but possibly shortsighted.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The settlement - which includes guilty pleas of violation of US laws - is the single largest fine ever slapped on a bank for going against US economic sanctions.\n\nThese sanctions were linked to business relating to countries such as Sudan, Iran and Cuba. US regulators went after the bank over its scheme to cover up transactions in these countries that amounted to some US$30 billion.\n\nThe 12-month suspension of US dollar direct clearing through BNP's office in New York - to begin on Jan 1 next year - will be limited to the oil-and-gas, energy, and commodity finance businesses booked here.\n\nAsked on the contributions of these businesses to the overall operations at BNP Singapore, Mr Veyres, who is also the head of the bank's South-east Asia operations, said: \"The oil and gas industries are key for the economy. It is an important sector for BNP Paribas in which we intend to remain one of the leading banks in that space.\"\n\nThe concerns now are the extent this would affect client relationship with the bank, and how much it would cost BNP to outsource this clearing function - a big part of trade finance that is mainly US-dollar denominated. A bank that offers US dollar clearing converts foreign-currency payments for its customers into the greenback.\n\nThe suspension, said The Wall Street Journal, was a step back from revoking BNP's New York licence, which would have effectively shut down its US operations.\n\nBNP said that it remains \"fully committed to growing our business in Singapore and in Asia-Pacific\".\n\nA Singapore-based spokeswoman said that BNP is sticking with its plan to increase its revenue from the region to more than three billion euros (S$5.11 billion) by 2016.\n\nThe settlement will result in an exceptional charge of 5.8 billion euros to be booked in the second quarter of this year. This excluded a much smaller provision that had earlier been set aside of US$1 billion.\n\nThe bank told analysts and the media in France that it has enough funds to back the fine and penalties. BNP said that its core Tier-1 capital ratio as at end-June stood at around 10 per cent of its risk-weighted assets. This is based on finalised Basel III rules.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But President Dilma Rousseff has already won, scoring ahead of October's elections as the tournament so far has the whiff of success.\n\nProtests that last year torpedoed Ms Rousseff's popularity have largely vanished. Brazil's airports, stadiums and security forces, contrary to widespread concerns, have lived up to the challenge. Discontent with cost overruns in the run-up to the games, exacerbated by bus, subway and police strikes, have given way to excitement over a tourney that has already seen more goals scored than in the 2010 cup.\n\nThe change in mood regarding the event that soccer-crazed Brazil awaited for seven years is a lifeline for Ms Rousseff, whose popularity had plummeted 27 percentage points in June from a year earlier. A slide of her approval ratings fuelled speculation that the opposition would regain power after 12 years.\n\nHaving halted the decline, Ms Rousseff remains the favourite to win re-election on Oct 5, said Christopher Garman, director of emerging markets and Latin America at Eurasia Group consulting firm in Washington.\n\n\"The pessimism has been going away, the news flow has been quite positive, and organisationally there have been no major hiccups,\" Mr Garman said. \"Brazil doesn't need to win the cup to stem her decline in the polls.\"\n\nAn Ibope poll one week into the tournament showed Ms Rousseff's approval rating unchanged at 44 per cent, while her lead over her nearest opponent, Aecio Neves, widened by two percentage points, within the margin of error, to 18 percentage points. In June last year her approval rating was 71 per cent, the Ibope poll showed.\n\nSepp Blatter, head of soccer's governing body Fifa, who in January complained about delays in getting the 12 World Cup stadiums ready, is now thanking Brazilians for their support. \"This is great,\" he said in a June 27 interview on the Fifa website, pointing out that there are more people flocking to the Fifa-sponsored Fan Fest viewing areas than joining the protests. \"I have to express thanks to the people of Brazil for the acceptance of this World Cup.\"\n\nThe Fifa Fan Fest at Copacabana beach in Rio gathered more than 500,000 people to watch Brazil squeeze by Chile in a penalty shootout to qualify for the quarter-finals.\n\nThe audience of Globo TV, the most watched network in Brazil, was up 29 per cent from the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in the first 32 games, according to Veja magazine columnist Lauro Jardim.\n\nHopes among Ms Rousseff's political opponents that protests, organisational missteps or a bad performance by the team would spoil the games were receding, Citibank said in a report last week. \"President Rousseff is relieved,\" the bank wrote in the note.\n\nThe fact that Ms Rousseff, after a three-month decline in the polls, has stemmed the tide with positive news from the World Cup has been crucial to renewing confidence in her campaign, said Ricardo Ribeiro, political analyst with consulting firm MCM. \"The balance has been positive, it's a break from the social tensions - that helps the government,\" added Mr Ribeiro. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n2\n\nDollar-selling is becoming a bubble, which may burst, HSBC says\n\n3\n\nStocks to watch: SGX, Frasers Centrepoint Trust, NTT DC Reit, BRC Asia\n\n4\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\n5\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value", "images": []}

Taking a minority stake in AirAsia Japan may be financially insignificant for the Japanese e-commerce giant. But the justification - boosting its travel website - is a stretch at best. Rakuten's patchy investment record is another reason to be sceptical.\n\nAirAsia Japan's initial capitalisation of US$69 million implies the e-commerce group is spending a little over US$12 million for its 18 per cent stake. It earned 13 times that amount in the first quarter alone. Even if the bill rises, it's unlikely to prompt a wholesale reassessment of the US$18 billion company.\n\nRakuten's reasons for diversifying into the capital-intensive and cyclical airline business are far from clear, however. Japan's low-cost carrier sector has been expanding quickly, and foreign ownership restrictions mean that AirAsia needs local partners to help fund the venture. A partnership with another airline is off the cards after it dissolved a fractious joint venture with ANA last year.\n\nRakuten makes a vague reference to boosting its online travel services, which saw just a 13.5 per cent year-on-year growth in transactions in Q1, compared with a 32 per cent expansion in its broader e-commerce business. But if there are benefits from combining a travel site with a budget airline, they have so far eluded the rest of the global travel industry.\n\nRakuten's investment record is both hyperactive and patchy: Since 2009, Rakuten has made 62 acquisitions and investments with a disclosed value of US$3.4 billion. In the past two years, it has taken almost US$400 million in impairment and restructuring charges on some of those deals.\n\nInvestors may take some comfort in the limited financial impact of Rakuten's AirAsia investment. But they should worry that the company is willing to spend their money so far outside its core business. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n2\n\nDollar-selling is becoming a bubble, which may burst, HSBC says\n\n3\n\nStocks to watch: SGX, Frasers Centrepoint Trust, NTT DC Reit, BRC Asia\n\n4\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\n5\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nRECOMMENDED", "images": []}

Stage 2 of the RFP will follow with the appointment of the next aggregator by end-2015.\n\nEMA stressed that \"the importer's primary function must be to fulfil Singapore's domestic demand for regasified LNG and the importer should ensure that this function remains its No 1 priority\".\n\nThe importer/s must also have a gas supply procurement strategy that provides for diversity of supply source, security of supply and price competitiveness to best meet Singapore's needs, EMA added. \"This could also include the procurement of piped natural gas.\"\n\nAdditionally, one of its functions is also to facilitate development of an LNG trading hub here, so importers are encouraged \"to submit a proposal which details how it would leverage or participate in trading activities such as temporary storage of LNG for future re-export and resale, subject to spare terminal capacity\".\n\nBT earlier reported that many leading local players - including Temasek- owned Pavilion Energy, Sembcorp and Keppel Corporation - are eyeing the second aggregatorship.\n\nEMA CEO Chee Hong Tat has also invited international players, many of whom have set up LNG desks here, from ExxonMobil and Shell to Gazprom, to participate in the RFP.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A \"sexy\" idea perhaps, not because it has to do with women but because it suggests the possibility of a quick fix to the problem of gender disparity within the professions by placing women at the commanding heights of the political system. If only life were so simple.\n\nAny prime minister has to work with the resources he has at his disposal. The sad fact is there are just not that many women with the requisite political and administrative experience to be able to handle Cabinet appointments - precisely because they have been excluded from higher echelons of government up to now. In fact, it can be argued that there is a dearth of good political talent generally - both male and female and at both central and local government levels. This may be a bigger cause of Japan's political and economic shortcomings than is generally acknowledged. There has never been a female prime minister (although Japan apparently had empresses in the 8th century). Male domination of the top political positions was not maintained in the face of opposition from competent women clamouring to take over these slots. In what is still a highly compliant society, women have not been encouraged to think of themselves as potential political leaders. They have, as a group, thus lacked the requisite experience to become such leaders and this is why it is unrealistic to suggest now that Mr Abe can remedy the situation \"at a stroke\" as it were by naming more women to key Cabinet positions.\n\nPolitical parties - Mr Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party especially - must encourage more women to enter politics, at central and local levels, and they also need to discipline those shamefully sexist males among their ranks who delight in making derogatory comments about their female colleagues. Likewise, government ministries and local administrative organs need to open their doors to more entrants from the ranks of highly intelligent but politically repressed women. That way, there will be a bigger pool of female Cabinet ministerial (and prime ministerial) talent to draw upon in the future.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Airbus acted \"proactively\" in cancelling the order for six double-deckers with Japan's Skymark Airlines Inc, and the manufacturer is confident it can place the already-built planes with another customer, Mr Enders said.\n\nAmong customers that have ordered the planes yet remain undecided about actually taking them is Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd, with six units on the order book. Qantas Airways Ltd had also planned to top up its existing fleet by as many as eight A380s, an expansion that's been thrown into doubt amid a cost-cutting drive. And Amedeo, an aircraft lessor that ordered 20 A380s this year, has yet to find a single client for the jet.\n\nThe A380 was designed to dethrone Boeing Co's 747 as the jet with the greatest range and capacity. While the A380 can hold more than 800 passengers, and was originally marketed as a plane that could comfortably accommodate 555 passengers in three classes, the majority of airlines have outfitted it with 500 seats or less. Mr Enders conceded that the market for very large aircraft remains \"weak\".\n\nThe A380 has one very faithful customer in Emirates, the Gulf carrier that has ordered a total of 140 planes. Mr Enders said that Airbus would be content with more repeat business from existing buyers because it's easier to build planes and customise the interiors with proven specifications.\n\n\"This is rather an unhealthy concentration of demand, as it represents a big single point risk,\" said Nick Cunningham, managing partner at London-based Agency Partners.\n\nAirbus chief financial officer Harald Wilhelm said that production for this year and next are secured, with the planemaker expecting to deliver \"around 30\" next year, letting Airbus break even on the programme going forward. Airbus has been trying to get early 2016 customers to move forward to take two delivery positions at the end of next year, though Mr Wilhelm offered no detail about whether that process is complete.\n\nEarnings before interest, tax and one-time items rose to 1.77 billion euros (S$2.96 billion) from 1.61 billion euros, with Airbus reiterating a full-year target for \"moderate return-on-sales growth\" and an increased jetliner backlog.\n\nNew plane orders, predicted earlier at around 630, are set to top that goal after Airbus left the Farnborough Air Show this month with 648 net contracts in hand and commitments for several hundred more aircraft.\n\nAirbus rose as much as 2.19 euros, or 5 per cent, to 45.88 euros in Paris, and traded at 45.66 euros as at 11.13am. That pares the stock's decline this year to 18 per cent, valuing the company at 35.5 billion euros.\n\nSecond-quarter sales rose 7 per cent to 14.6 billion euros, beating the average analyst estimate of 14.2 billion euros.\n\nAirbus reiterated that it wants to sell its stake in Dassault Aviation SA, the French maker of the Rafale fighter jet as well as the Falcon business aircraft. Mr Enders said that \"it's not a question of 'if' but a question of 'when'\" the holding will be sold, declining to elaborate on the mechanics of a disposal.\n\nThe A350 is on track for certification in the third quarter and service entry later in the year, the company said. The A320neo, which has more fuel-efficient engines than the current plane, is being prepared for its first flight next month and commercial operations in the fourth quarter of next year. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM", "images": []}

You can still get your fill of dinner, drinks, and dancing at the same location with the newly opened Match Restaurant and next-door commercial dance club Bang Bang.\n\nMatch is a New York-style restaurant serving American cuisine, still run by Royal Room's owners Prive Group and Massive Collective, except with the addition of two new partners - 28-year-old Sarissa Schwartz and her husband, Joshua.\n\nAccording to Ms Schwartz, the main aim of the newly-renovated Match is to provide customers with a complete dining experience in the form of a \"vibe dining\" concept. The latter, she says, is a concept that originated in Europe, where a late dinner is combined with a DJ spinning in the background, before diners move the party to a club.\n\nShe explains: \"We noticed there was a need in the market for an establishment that bridged the gap between dining and late night. We serve our full menu until midnight and bar snacks until 3am. It is vibe-dining as we have a DJ and the energy will slowly increase as the night goes on.\"\n\nThe restaurant's name comes from the menu's concept, where diners get to mix and match their main course, choice of sauce, a side and a vegetable, all for $29 to $95 depending on the final components. Too much fussing? Diners can also order off a regular a la carte menu.\n\n\"By constantly dining out, we realised it was very difficult to find quality healthy items at a restaurant that served yummy decadent food as well,\" says Ms Schwartz, who moved here three years ago from New York. \"My husband always said he would love to find a restaurant where he could have a healthy option. So we give suggested pairings, but it's ultimately what you decide.\"\n\nOf the reason for the revamp, Philip Poon, director and co-owner at Massive Collective, points out that Royal Room's clientele are now being served at other outlets owned by the group, such as premium bottle-service lounge Fenix Room at Clarke Quay.\n\n\"We felt there was an opportunity to do a dining destination with a bit of a vibe, linked to a club. Match is a one-stop destination that you don't get anywhere else in Singapore.\"\n\nBy Rachel Loi\n\nCorner House\n\n1 Cluny Road, EJH Corner House, Nassim Gate, Singapore Botanic Gardens | Tel 6469 1000\n\nwww.cornerhouse.com.sg\n\nHours: 12-3pm, 6.30-11pm (Mon-Sat), 11.30am-3pm and 6.30-11pm (Sun)\n\nLOCAL chef Jason Tan has lately been so taken with the concept of \"gastro-botanica\", he wants to pioneer the movement here. A cooking philosophy that goes beyond a mother's well-meaning nag to finish the vegetables on your plate, gastro-botanical is, in chef Tan's interpretation, botanicals-inspired cuisine that melds primarily French techniques with global flavours.\n\n\"Vegetables will not be treated as mere garnishes, but as important as the proteins that share the plate too,\" explains Mr Tan, a Les Amis and Saint Julien kitchen alumnus who last headed Sky on 57 at the Marina Bay Sands as its executive chef.\n\nSo you may get, for example, a plate of carabinero prawn flanked with tomatoes marinated with Thai basil and plum, a quenelle of tomato sorbet and a light-as-air marshmallow of tomato essence. In another signature dish, the French Cevennes onion is singularly showcased in four ways: confit with black truffles and egg, made into a filo pastry tart, dehydrated into a chip, and infused with tea and served as a broth. Edible chocolate pebbles and lemon juice-pickled shimeji mushrooms in your dessert? All par for the course.\n\nThis all marries very well with the Botanic Gardens surrounds of chef Tan's new venture, Corner House, he says. Opened to the public from last night, the casual fine-dining affair seats 70 over two floors of the black and white villa that formerly housed French fine dining restaurant Au Jardin, which closed in March.\n\nIn chef Tan and business partner Renny Heng's hands, the space has now been fashioned into a homely but handsome eatery that pays tribute to EJH Corner, a leading botanist and former assistant director of the gardens in the early 1900s, and for whom the house once served as a private residence. The pair spent over two months researching archives here and in the United Kingdom, including in-depth correspondences with Mr Corner's son, John, to find elements that link the restaurant back to Mr Corner's residency.\n\nPhotographs of the late Mr Corner and his watercolour artworks kit out the restaurant reception - once the latter's study and dining room - alongside William Farquhar-commissioned sketches by Asian artists of the fungi and local botanical monkey species that Mr Corner was credited to have founded.\n\nUpstairs, glass-encased verandahs offer 180-degree leafy views of the gardens in full air-conditioned comfort. Granite-coloured chairs bring the outdoors in and even the tableware bear botanical elements: porcelain plates resemble oyster shells and lily pads, glass plates are finished with a volcanic glaze and table-side salt holders are carved out of whole rocks.\n\nMr Heng, a self-professed lover of all things vintage, says he's had his eye on the iconic site for a long time. \"If I wanted to do another modern restaurant, I would have done it in the city,\" adds the founder of wine importers, Wine Culture, of the S$1.5 million venture. He also owns winebar Verre on Robertson Quay and French tavern Shelter in the Woods, which is closed for refurbishment until September.\n\nExpect, naturally, a winelist spanning 600 carefully curated wines from the Old and New World, including 50 labels available by the half-bottle. Dinners start from S$98 for a four-course menu, and lunch sets, which start in a month, begin at S$38 for three courses. Or go the whole hog with a eight-course degustation menu for S$248 per person.\n\nBy Debbie Yong\n\nShima restaurant\n\nGoodwood Park Hotel, 22 Scotts Road | Tel 6734 6281\n\nHours: 12pm to 3pm and 6pm to 10pm daily\n\nwww.shimarestaurant.com.sg\n\nTONY Chng, chief operating officer of JR Group Holdings Pte Ltd, has fond memories of the first time he ate at Shima restaurant when his then girlfriend (now wife) took him there almost 10 years ago.\n\n\"At that time we were still dating. She was in healthcare and among the medical fraternity they liked coming to Shima for the fresh sashimi brought in every Tuesday and Friday,\" he recalls.\n\nSo when he heard the original owner, Katsuhiro Watanabe, was retiring to return to Japan, he decided to buy over the business and try to revive it for a younger generation of customers. \"Shima is quite well-known among people who patronised the place during the 80s and 90s. But over the years the awareness is lacking. The younger generation doesn't really know the brand,\" says Mr Chng, whose company runs food-related businesses including catering, manufacturing as well as restaurants Imperial Feast and Oceanspoon Dining.\n\nThe teppanyaki restaurant has been at its current location at Goodwood Park Hotel since it opened its doors in 1980, and has since received multiple awards including \"Singapore's Top Restaurant 1998/1999\" by Wine & Dine Magazine.\n\nAnd after closing for a two-month renovation, Shima reopened about a month ago with a more modern look and brighter decor.\n\nBut that's pretty much all he intends to change about the 34-year-old restaurant, promises Mr Chng. Other familiar elements like the custom-made teppanyaki griddle, the food suppliers, and the chefs, will remain.\n\nThe menu will also stay the same, so regular diners can still get their teppanyaki buffets of tempura, sashimi, and an assortment of teppanyaki items for S$49.90++ on weekdays and S$59.90++ on weekends. However, they did add a few items, like a range of Aburi sushi (S$10-S$35), and an Australian lamb tenderloin option for the set meal (S$45 per 120g). Retaining the original recipes and dishes while modernising the brand image are all part of how Mr Chng hopes to make the restaurant more relevant for the new generation.\n\nHe says: \"As a customer myself, I would not go to Shima every day. But it was a place I would visit for special occasions or to bring Japanese friends for dinner. Now we hope to connect with younger customers, so Shima can go back to those days when it was one of the best restaurants for people who wanted good Japanese food.\"\n\nBy Rachel Loi\n\nWild Rocket\n\nHangout Hotel, 10A Upper Wilkie Road Tel 63399448\n\nHours: 12-3pm (lunch), 3-6pm (tea) 6.30-10.30pm (dinner) from Mon to Sat\n\nWILD Rocket has re-opened in the same space atop Mount Emily after a seven-month hiatus. Gone are its corporate grey interiors and in their place is an uber-trendy, Japanese teahouse-inspired space that reflects chef-owner Willin Low's fascination with Nippon culture.\n\n\"The ingredients in Japan are so good that you can go to a supermarket and get inspiration straightaway,\" adds Mr Low, who spent over a month living there. Looking to keep abreast of competition, he closed the eight-year-old restaurant in December in search of a new space, but returned to the same spot for nostalgic reasons, he says.\n\nMenu-wise, Wild Rocket still flies the Mod-Sin flag with popular classics seamlessly integrated with new creations bearing Thai, Cambodian and Filipino influences from his various travels around the region.\n\nTo best take in the self-taught chef's culinary evolution, opt for the omakase lunch and dinner sets at the chef's table that seats six to 10, where you will get a span of old favourites such as a Thai pomelo salad with ice-cream dressing, to new-fangled creations of local salted egg yolk crab-inspired crab cakes, and the cheekily dubbed \"Singapore fried noodles\", an ever-changing course showcasing Mr Low's varying takes on noodles. The restaurant's signature laksa pesto pasta - which over the years have come to epitomise mod-Sin cooking - gets a 2014 update as a richly aromatic laksa risotto topped with pan-seared Hokkaido scallop. End off with homely desserts such as a matcha sugee cake, or a peppy pineapple sorbet topped with crystalised soy sauce from a small-batch local brewer and a sprinkle of chilli - a tribute to the way the chef's grandfather enjoyed his fruit.\n\nBy Debbie Yong\n\n2am : dessertbar\n\n21a Lorong Liput | Tel 6291 9727\n\n| Hours: 10am-2pm (Mon-Sat)\n\nAFTER years as Singapore's dessert stalwart, 2am : dessertbar closed last week for a 10-day rehaul of the space, its first since it opened in Holland Village in 2007.\n\nWhen it rolls its shutters back up next week, expect new features such as a full cocktail bar showcasing concoctions designed to be paired with dessert, cosy custom-designed booth seats and \"chocolate tables\", or chocolate-painted tables that diners can eat directly off, says chef-owner Janice Wong. \"We have been constantly evolving for the last seven years and felt we have outgrown our current fit-out,\" adds Ms Wong, who has gone on to bag global accolades such as the title of Asia's Best Pastry Chef at the Asia 50 Best Restaurant Awards for two years running.\n\nHer notable forays in edible art in recent years, for instance, is now something diners can interact with in the 40-seater space through edible art paintings that line the whimsical mirror-clad entrance hall to a \"sweets gallery\" that diners can lick and pick at as they wander through. Instead of the space's original brown sofas and minimalist decor, expect a more open, industrial design brief fashioned around an understated palette of black, white and grey.\n\n\"The spirit and elements of surprise will remain,\" says Ms Wong. While the outlet's main focus is still on dessert, expect more savoury additions to the menu in the form of small and large dishes from S$10 to S$30. And if you loathe to join the wait for a spot in the weekends, another new feature at 2am: dessertbar v2.0 is a ground-floor takeaway bar, which will offer churros, beignets, liquid tarts, magnums from S$5 to S$8. Ms Wong also has several large projects in the works, she hints, though further details can only be revealed next month, so watch this space for more.\n\nBy Debbie Yong\n\nThe Disgruntled Chef\n\n26B Dempsey Road | Tel 64765305\n\nHours: Tues to Thurs: 12pm to 2.30pm, 6pm to 10.30pm.

The 1,608 sq m restaurant has been redecorating every Monday since the beginning of June. \"The new earthy colour palette is inspired by the history of Dempsey Road,\" says chef Sia. Dark brown plantation shutters have been added, and rattan woven designs now cover the booths, a nod to the original British barracks and nutmeg plantation that once occupied the space, adding privacy to the otherwise airy 12-seater indoor area. The overall look will be complete by the end of August. The team also sees a new additon with Jac Lim, who left the restaurant as sous chef, and returns as head chef.\n\nReplacing the brunch big and small options are 12 new brunch tartines, priced at S$20 or S$25, including vegetarian dishes such as the Turkish (S$25, made with stuffed eggplant on grilled pita bread. \"The overall food menu gets lighter and infused with more colours,\" says chef Sia. This includes signature dishes like the crackling suckling pig (S$68), now served with sauerkraut puree and pickled mustard seeds. Dishes on the main menu are priced at S$8 to S$21 for small plates and S$26 to S$98 for big plates.\n\nBy Georgine Verano\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These loans totalled S$598 billion, preliminary figures released by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) yesterday showed. In May, total loans rose 1.1 per cent from a month earlier.\n\nTotal business loans slid 0.3 per cent to S$367 billion in June. In May, business loans grew 1.5 per cent.\n\nLoans to manufacturers declined 2.3 per cent in June to S$31.1 billion. This is a reversal from growth in May.\n\nThere are signs that this weakness will continue. A survey by the Economic Development Board (EDB) yesterday showed that Singapore manufacturers have become less cheery about their business prospects for the second half of this year, compared to a quarter ago.\n\nA research note from DBS Group yesterday said: \"The moderation in business loans is likely to persist as the key manufacturing sector continues to face strong external headwinds and pressure from domestic restructuring.\"\n\nLending for general commerce - the third-largest component in the Sing-dollar business loan segment - dropped 3 per cent to S$81.2 billion. This is a deep reversal from a near 3 per cent gain in May.\n\nThere was also softness in June's foreign-currency trade loans: a key indicator since many trade loans are priced in US dollars. This was seen from the first month-on-month decline in these loans since September last year, at about one per cent to S$92.9 billion.\n\nStill, some stronger loan growth could come from the services sector, in line with more optimistic business expectations from services firms, said Selena Ling, OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy.\n\nSing-dollar consumer loans were a shade stronger, up 0.6 per cent in June at S$230 billion. This compares with the 0.5 per cent increase in May.\n\nThe lift came mainly from credit card loans, up 2 per cent at S$9.85 billion. They have now replaced car loans as the second-largest form of consumer loans.\n\nOn a year-on-year comparison, overall Sing-dollar bank lending was up 12.3 per cent in June. This means loan growth has slowed on a yearly comparison for the seventh straight time.\n\nSing-dollar deposits contracted for the third consecutive month, down 0.3 per cent in June from May at S$535 billion. Barclays analysts expect funding costs to increase due to competition for deposits.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They surveyed 103 Singapore-listed companies from a range of industries, with about 75 per cent having annual revenues exceeding S$50 million.\n\nAlmost a third (29 per cent) of respondents in the KPMG-SMU Singapore Fraud Survey 2014 report out yesterday said that at least one fraud incident had occurred in their company in the past two years, up from 22 per cent when the survey was last published in 2011.\n\nNotably, the survey found that the bulk of fraud was still being perpetrated by insiders - with the proportion of fraud carried out by employees rising to 58 per cent, from 47 per cent in 2011.\n\nThere was no change in the percentage of fraud incidents carried out by management, such as board members and senior management (17 per cent).\n\nOverall, internal fraud constituted 75 per cent of fraud in 2014, up from 64 per cent in 2011. The report noted that fraud committed by internal parties was identified as a top concern in the 2011 edition.\n\nFraud perpetrated by external parties dropped to 25 per cent from 36 per cent.\n\nBob Yap, head of Advisory at KPMG in Singapore said: \"The increase in internal fraud since 2011 suggests that while many companies in Singapore already have anti-fraud controls in place, these controls are often inadequate.\"\n\nMore than half (53 per cent) of respondents said fraud occurred due to weak or overridden internal controls, despite most having fraud risk management measures in place. Collusion was another significant concern - almost half the respondents said collusion between employees and third parties (30 per cent) or collusion among employees (17 per cent) enabled fraud to occur.\n\n\"With 58 per cent of fraud being committed by employees, it is important to address this risk by setting a strong tone from the top - an organisation's board of directors plays a critical role in the oversight of programmes to mitigate the risk of fraud and misconduct. The board, together with its management, is responsible for setting a moral tone and ensuring institutional support for ethical and responsible business practices at the highest levels of the organisation, \" Mr Yap added.\n\nWhile more than half (58 per cent) of the respondents said their company management monitors fraud risk indicators to pre-empt fraudulent activity, the survey report said much more can be done to manage fraud risk and proactively boost the effectiveness of existing controls. There is also room to improve how anti-fraud measures are reviewed and adjusted. Only 78 per cent of respondents said their company reviews the effectiveness of its control measures regularly, and just 74 per cent do so after each fraud incident.\n\n\"The best time to plan is before a fraud occurs, not afterwards,\" Mr Yap pointed out.\n\nMore than half of fraud incidents were first detected by employees or customers, which suggests the importance of a people-focused approach to fraud risk management. The survey also found that one in 10 respondents said that fraud incidents were first detected by data analytics or other investigative procedures.\n\nIn light of this finding, Mr Yap said: \"As the power and prevalence of data analytics increase, it is likely that the use of technological solutions to identify fraud will continue to grow.\"\n\nExpectedly, companies are also increasingly concerned about cyber crime, especially when it comes to employee behaviour. Almost two-thirds (64 per cent) were very concerned about employees misusing sensitive information; more than half were very concerned about falsification and manipulation of company records, master data and/or electronic audit trails; and 50 per cent were very concerned about employees stealing company assets using technology such as e-banking, indicating theft by electronic means is a growing worry (up from 30 per cent in 2011).\n\nCurrently, only one in five respondents were completely satisfied with their organisation's e-crime defences.\n\nMr Yap commented: \"E-crime is an emerging area of concern and tackling it is proving challenging in the absence of in-depth understanding of how e-crime occurs and how it can be prevented.\n\nUnderstanding the trends in external threats and using this insight to formulate policy and strategy is critical to long-term incident prevention.\n\n\"Knowledge and awareness among end users is similarly critical. Returns from investing in IT security tools are best provided by staff who understand their responsibilities for keeping their networks safe.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That the SGX is keen and is exploring ways to bring in more such companies has been reported by BT recently.\n\nThe task is an uphill one, knowing that Singapore is competing with the likes of the United States and Norway. Both these markets provide large access to liquidity and capital and are steeped in the maritime tradition. They also have investor bases that are familiar and knowledgable about the sector.\n\nNorway and the US are thus more attractive locations for shipping and marine companies looking to tap a lucrative and savvy investor base. It follows then that their stock exchanges are the best options for such primary listings.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But though a mature technology, there are concerns about the possibility of damage to the bare die package during the surface mount technology process, when components are mounted onto the surface of printed circuit boards.\n\nSTATS ChipPAC said its eWLCSP has a thin polymer case on the back and four side walls of the die, which, when compared to traditional bare die WLCSP, provides mechanical robustness and resistance to chipping, cracking and handling damage.\n\nSaid Han Byung Joon, its executive vice-president and chief technology officer: \"With the added inspection costs and quality issues that customers face with bare die packaging, there is a clear and immediate need for a more robust WLCSP solution. The molded eWLCSP offers just that. Instead of managing quality through inspection, customers now have the opportunity to build quality into their product by design.\"\n\nThe protective polymer casing for eWLCSP is the same encapsulation material used as part of STATS ChipPAC's FlexLine manufacturing process. The semiconductor firm said that this provides mechanical and optical protection for the bare die, both during shipping and handling and socket insertion for electrical tests.\n\nThe firm, whose share price has jumped in recent months on speculation of a possible takeover, will release its second-quarter results on Aug 8.\n\nThe counter slipped 0.5 cent to close at 59.5 Singapore cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/one-alternative", "site_title": "A-One alternative", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nA-One alternative\n\nThe new Mini One with a new 1.2-litre turbo is the only Mini in COE Category A. By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jul 25, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nAND One makes three. The new Mini One is the third Mini to be introduced with a new engine, one that belongs to BMW's Efficient Dynamics engine family.\n\nBMW, which owns Mini, uses a half-litre cylinder as a building block for a new range of turbocharged three-cylinder, four-cylinder and six-cylinder engines. While the Cooper S gets a 2.0-litre four-cylinder unit, the Cooper uses a 1.5-litre three-pot engine.\n\nThe entry-level Mini One's 1.2-litre unit is actually derived from the Cooper's power plant but with a reduction in capacity. It also means that all three Mini variants - the One, Cooper and Cooper S - now have turbocharged engines (both the previous One and Cooper had a naturally aspirated 1.6-litre four-cylinder engine).\n\nMore importantly, the Mini One is the only Mini to qualify for COE Category A for cars with engines below 1,600 cc and 130 hp.\n\nThe direct injection 1.2-litre turbo produces 102 hp and 180 Nm, up four hp with torque unchanged. But because the new engine's 180 Nm is available from 1,400 rpm instead of the previous 3,000, the difference is clear.\n\nA six-speed automatic transmission continues to connect the engine to the front wheels but the new Mini One is more responsive. It is 10 kg heavier because of enhanced safety equipment and electronics, but still weighs it at a svelte 1,120 kg.\n\nThis means it feels more enthusiastic than its small displacement suggests. Zero to 100 kmh is accomplished in 10.2 seconds, down significantly from 12.3 seconds before. Top speed is higher too at 195 kmh from 181 kmh previously, while fuel economy has also improved from 6.7 litres/100 km to 5.0 litres/100 km.\n\nTogether with a brand new bodyshell, the car is almost unrecognisable as the One. This third generation Mini is longer and wider, with a wheelbase that has been lengthened by 28mm to 2,495mm.\n\nNoise and vibration levels are down and the new Mini is so refined that it feels and sounds like a small BMW. The suspension is more supple than before, without the harshness that a pothole in the past would elicit.\n\nThe steering may not be as meaty as a Cooper S's but the One is still nimble. Flick the wheel and it changes direction easily. No other car in this price segment will make a U-turn as quickly or take an S-bend as competently as this diminutive model.\n\nBut the key word is diminutive. Despite the increase in size, the Mini One's two rear seats are best occupied by not more than average sized adults. As befits its positioning though, the One's cabin has quality materials and nice finishes.\n\nLike the Cooper and Cooper S, the speedo now has a subsidiary tachometer attached to it and both are placed directly in front of the driver. But in the One, the Mini Centre Instrument does not get an LCD screen, only a thin LED strip for the radio, telephony and vehicle functions. The LED ring will still change colour though, and the audio system is surprisingly good.\n\nAs a sporty little model, the Mini One is the perfect city car for someone who doesn't need too much space. It handles well with a small and efficient engine. But it still has enough refinement to make it a premium ride.\n\nsamuelee@sph.com.sg\n\nSPECS\n\nMini One\n\nEngine\n\n1,198cc inline-3 turbocharged\n\nTransmission\n\n6-speed auto\n\nMax power\n\n102 hp @ 4,250-6,000 rpm\n\nMax torque\n\n180 Nm @ 1,400-4,000 rpm\n\n0-100 kmh\n\n10.2 secs\n\nTop speed\n\n195 kmh\n\nCO2 emissions\n\n117 g/km\n\nAverage OMV\n\nS$22,000\n\nPrice\n\nS$123,300 (with COE)\n\nDistributor\n\nEurokars Habitat\n\nTel\n\n6473 3777\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

From March 2002 to June 2003, he served as vice-chairman of the board, ascending to the chairman's post on July 1, 2003. He became a director of Great Eastern Holdings in 2005.\n\nDuring his 11-year tenure as OCBC chairman, Dr Cheong was instrumental in the implementation of initiatives which were of strategic importance to the proper positioning and continued growth of the bank, especially in people-management, succession planning and executive development, the bank said.\n\nHe also led the board in working with the management team to strengthen the bank's balance sheet following the 2009 global financial crisis.\n\nOCBC Bank was named the world's strongest bank in 2011 and 2012, and ranked second-strongest last year.\n\nDr Cheong's leadership and vision are also evidenced by the significant strides the bank has made over the years, said OCBC. It is today among the world's best capitalised banks and one of the few to have maintained AA credit ratings.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2013, group net profit rose from S$1.15 billion to S$2.77 billion, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 10 per cent. Assets grew nearly three times to S$338 billion.\n\nBasic earnings per share rose from 35.4 cents to 78.0 cents; net dividends to shareholders grew from 12.7 cents to 34.0 cents per share.\n\nDuring the last 11 years, OCBC restructured Great Eastern Holdings as its insurance subsidiary. The bank acquired a stake in Bank NISP, which was subsequently merged with Bank OCBC Indonesia to form Bank OCBC NISP, the bank's banking subsidiary in Indonesia. Islamic Banking subsidiary OCBC Al-Amin Bank Berhad was incorporated in Malaysia.\n\nThe most significant deal was in 2010, when it acquired ING Asia Private Bank, which was renamed Bank of Singapore, OCBC Bank's wholly owned private-banking unit.\n\nThe in-coming chairman Mr Ooi, who became a Singapore permanent resident in March, joined the OCBC board on Feb 21, 2012. He was appointed the non-executive lead independent director of the main board on Oct 31 last year - a role that has prepared him for the chairmanship, OCBC said.\n\nHe joined the board of OCBC Bank (Malaysia) Berhad on April 6, 2012, became its deputy chairman 71/2 months later, and its chairman on March 30 this year.\n\nHe comes to the OCBC helm with a wealth of financial services experience. He started his career at BNM in 1971, holding a number of positions in the economics, monetary and international sectors for more than 13 years before becoming chief economist for South-east Asia and the Asia-Pacific at Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore.\n\nHe moved on to become the managing director of Warburg Asset Management Pte Ltd, also in Singapore, and then returned to Malaysia in 1996. From that year until 2002, he was a director on the boards of several RHB Group companies.\n\nMr Ooi returned to BNM in 2002 as its deputy governor and board member, holding these positions until 2010. He was responsible for major areas of monetary policy, reserve management and financial sector development. He became special adviser to BNM from 2010 until his retirement in 2011.\n\nHe is concurrently chairman of Cagamas Berhad (the national mortgage corporation in Malaysia) and its subsidiaries, as well as chairman of Xeraya Capital Sdn Bhd and Xeraya Capital Labuan Ltd. He is a Fellow Member of the Institute of Bankers Malaysia.\n\nMarket observers do not expect much change to OCBC under him.\n\nKenneth Ng, CIMB's head of research, said: \"Dr Cheong didn't really drive strategy, he was probably not the most hands-on chairman . . . The strategy and execution were driven by the chief executive.\"\n\nOutside the boardroom, however, Dr Cheong - with his penchant for acting and spouting Shakespeare - was more fun to watch than the average bank chairman.\n\nSingapore corporate watchers were agog when he had a spat with former DBS Bank chief executive Jackson Tai, who in 2005 had criticised a local bank - which he did not name - for its \"irresponsible\" proposal to return capital to shareholders in early 2003.\n\nMany people took it that he was jibing at OCBC. Dr Cheong responded by calling him \"sanctimonious\", famously quoting from Shakespeare's play, Julius Caesar:\n\n\"The fault, dear Jackson, lies not in our stars (nor in UOB or OCBC), but in ourselves.\"\n\nMr Tai later apologised for his comments.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Ten people were injured and taken to hospital.\n\nTaiwan's civil aviation authorities said that the weather on Wednesday had been suitable for flying and they were trying to determine the cause of the crash.\n\n\"There were nine flights on the same route between 2pm and 7pm yesterday. Only the TransAsia flight crashed,\" said Jean Shen, director of the Civil Aeronautics Administration. \"The weather reports showed it was totally OK for landing. We cannot say for sure what went wrong at this point.\n\n\"The flight safety committee has opened an investigation . . . they will complete an official report within a year.\"\n\nMs Shen said that authorities were not ruling anything out. Both black boxes had been found and officials would be examining them soon, she said.\n\nThe aircraft took off from Taiwan's southern city of Kaohsiung, headed for the airport of Magong, but crash-landed during a thunder storm in Huxi township of Penghu County, the main island of a chain known as the Pescadores.\n\nNo one on the ground was hurt.\n\nAirline seats and life jackets were strewn around the crash site and the roof of a nearby building was destroyed.\n\nTaiwan President Ma Ying-jeou said that all of the island's people were grieving. \"Today is a very sad day in the history of Taiwan aviation,\" Mr Ma said on Wednesday.\n\nChina's President Xi Jinping, who is on a Latin America tour, felt \"deeply grieved\" after learning the tragedy had caused heavy casualties, the mainland's State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, said in a statement, according to the Xinhua news agency.\n\nThe mainland and Taiwan have been rivals for decades, with the mainland regarding Taiwan as a renegade province, though commercial relations have grown in recent years.\n\nTyphoon Matmo hit Taiwan on Wednesday, bringing heavy rain and strong wind, shutting financial markets and schools. It later passed the island and headed towards China, downgraded from typhoon to tropical storm.\n\nTaiwan has had a poor record for aviation safety over the last two decades, though it has improved recently after the government tightened up safety measures.\n\nTransAsia had been involved in eight \"incidents\" since 2002, including this latest one and an earlier fatal accident, according to data on the website of the Aviation Safety Council.\n\nThe other fatal accident was in 2002 when a cargo plane carrying two pilots crashed into the sea. The pilots did not respond appropriately to ice accumulated on the wing surface, it said.\n\nTransAsia and bigger rivals, China Airlines and Eva Airways, have been facing pressure from higher energy prices and increasingly popular budget airlines.\n\nTransAsia Airways is a Taiwan-based airline with a fleet of around 23 Airbus and ATR aircraft, operating chiefly short-haul flights on domestic routes as well as to mainland China, Japan, Thailand and Cambodia, among its Asian destinations.\n\nShares of TransAsia ended down 5.5 per cent after opening 7 per cent lower.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jul 25, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nAT 70, most people are likely to be taking it slow, enjoying the finer things in life. But not American architect Thom Mayne. Instead, his life has gotten even busier. He has been away from his office in the United States for the past two and a half weeks, having spent much of that time in Sydney and Perth, before arriving in Singapore this week to be on the jury panel for the President's Design Award. Then he's off to China where he is working on several projects. Architecture, he says, is like being in a long distance run. He started his career at 27, \"but it was only when I was 50 that I was getting a series of larger works, then everything started speeding up, which is completely typical of an architect's life.\"\n\nAsk him what has been the best moment of his 43-year career, and he says it is difficult to pinpoint one moment. \"It's getting better and better and I love it. I have never had more fun.\"\n\nHe says: \"Architecture is completely out of sync with the current world, which is moving at the speed of light. Young people today have a much shorter fuse, and I often tell younger architects to keep at what they are doing, to get the serious work.\"\n\nMr Mayne started his firm Morphosis, an interdisciplinary practice involved in rigorous design and research that yields innovative, iconic buildings and urban environments in 1972. His early works were private residences, but today he does a myriad of works, from commercial to cultural, government and educational. His name may not be familiar in this part of the world, but Mr Mayne is considered one of the world's most influential architects. Among the many accolades he has received is the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2005. Of the award, he says, it is a great honour as not many Americans have won it. \"But I'm the most unlikely person to receive it. I do modest commissions, and public work. I'm a private person, and I don't see public recognition,\" he says.\n\nSome of his key projects include the Perot Museum of Nature and Science in Dallas, The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in New York and Emerson College Los Angeles, as well as the upcoming Phare Tower in France. In Asia, he's built the Giant Interactive Group Corporate Headquarters in Shanghai, Seoul Performing Arts Centre and the Taipei Performing Arts Centre.\n\nOn top of his work, Mr Mayne also leads The Now Institute, an academic research think tank and master planning design group, embedded in UCLA's Department of Architecture and Urban Design. His buildings come in non-conventional shapes and form, but are aesthetically pleasing to the eye. Yet, he points out that he isn't interested in the aesthetic side of things.\n\n\"I'm interested in the building's ability to interact and change things. If architecture doesn't do that, then I have no idea what architecture is,\" he says.\n\nWith Cooper Union, the institution resembles a cube, but with \"cracks\" running down it. It looks massive but strangely is light at the same time. \"The client was looking for a building that is idiosyncratic,\" he says. He conceived the building as a vehicle to foster collaboration and cross-disciplinary dialogue among the college's three schools, previously housed in separate buildings. A vertical piazza, the central space for informal social, intellectual and creative exchange, forms the heart of the new academic building.\n\nIn the spirit of the institution's dedication to free, open and accessible education, the building itself is symbolically open to the city. Visual transparencies and accessible public spaces connect the institution to the physical, social and cultural fabric of its urban context. At street level, the transparent facade invites the neighbourhood to observe and to take part in the intensity of activity contained within.\n\nMr Mayne is particularly proud of the building which is not just a school, but a \"whole programme for cultural and social pedagogy\".\n\nHe doesn't see architecture as a \"singular act\", but connected to urban design. His approach to architecture is also why he doesn't go with preconceived notions of how a building should look when approached by a client. \"I don't start with ideas. I start by asking what is the problem. Is it a social, environment or urban problem? Then ideas start generating and a form comes out of that,\" he says. \"If you are too focused on a form, you cannot rejuvenate yourself.\"\n\nThe job of an architect he says is to \"make physical an idea\".\n\nWith over four decades of experience, Mr Mayne has the formula to being a successful architect down pat.\n\n\"You need to be able to switch from a creative world to the real world,\" he says. By that, he means being able to have ideas, but also to be able to deal with the demands of developers and builders. \"That is the most demanding part of the job, either you are meant for it or not,\" he says.\n\nHaving a client who is open to ideas is another. \"You need to have clients who are not resistant to ideas,\" he says, adding that a successful collaboration is much like a marriage. \"I've turned away work that I didn't want to do,\" he points out. \"In architecture, a huge amount of who you become as an architect is by the work you choose to do.\"\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\n@TaySuanChiangBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Samoan women's rugby team switched to Thai Airways International from Malaysia Air on July 27 for a flight to a world cup event in France.\n\nThe cancellations may add to the financial difficulties of an airline whose state-run parent, Khazanah Nasional Bhd, estimated that it only had enough cash to operate for a year even before the latest crash. The two Malaysia Air disasters have left 537 people dead this year, which means 2014 will be the worst year in almost a decade for commercial airline fatalities.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n2\n\nDollar-selling is becoming a bubble, which may burst, HSBC says\n\n3\n\nStocks to watch: SGX, Frasers Centrepoint Trust, NTT DC Reit, BRC Asia\n\n4\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\n5\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/c725f93e9d778a3a57201368a3306bcfc573383d15b13b538ce0956038d0a2c7?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Troubled: The airline said on July 19 that it would refund fares to customers postponing travel or cancelling their tickets, including non-refundable ones. -\u00a0PHOTO: BLOOMBERG"}]}

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/burgundy-its-best-and-budget", "site_title": "Burgundy at its best, and on a budget", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nBurgundy at its best, and on a budget\n\nDespite rising prices and scarcity, it is still possible to find good, enjoyable red and white Burgundy at affordable prices, says NK YONG\n\nPublished Thu, Jul 24, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWITH today's escalating prices coupled with the scarcity of Burgundy, the most sought-after wine today, the oft-asked question is: \"Is it possible to find good, enjoyable Burgundy, red and white, at affordable prices?\" The answer is: \"Yes, of course!\" Here's a quick overview of the current Burgundy market to provide the context for the rest. Burgundy's production is minuscule compared to that of Bordeaux; re-classify that to mean quality Burgundy at the same level of Cru Classe Bordeaux, and it is like comparing a midget to a giant. It does not take an economist to see that Burgundies will always be more expensive than Bordeaux.\n\nThe recent hail-storms in Burgundy - the third year in succession - have made an already difficult situation even more difficult, probably financially catastrophic for many small growers because for the third year in a row they are seeing their productions reduced, in some cases as sadly as 75 per cent of their normal production. Translated further, it means that downstream we will be faced with greater difficulties in finding Burgundy, as well as higher costs for our indulgences.\n\nIn Asia, we have an additional factor contributing to the high cost of our Burgundy - and that is the Asian cultural practice of equating social status with money. Status is measured by the dollars that it costs you - be it your car, where you and your children holiday, or what wine you consume with your friends. In other words - \"face\". To serve or give as a gift a wine of Village Classe level would be regarded disrespectful of your friends or of the recipient. It would also mean that the giver or host has no class. Paradoxically, this suits us lesser mortals because the focus will not be on \"budget\" Burgundies but on \"trophy\" wine.\n\nThe keys to affordable Burgundies:\n\nFirst key:\n\nFocus on the Village Classe level of Burgundies, especially those from the less popular appellations, eg in the Cote de Nuits are Nuits Saint-George, Morey-Saint-Denis. In the Cote de Beaune, all appellations are less popular.\n\nSecond key:\n\nFocus on the less expensive Domaines and the less popular appellations. The expensive Domaines include Romanee-Conti, Comte de Vogue, Leroy, Armand Rousseau, Dujac, Lafon, Leflaive, etc. Less expensive houses include the big houses that are both negociants and Domaines - Drouhin, Jadot, Faiveley, Bouchard Pere et Fil, to name the most well-known. They are all large vineyard owners, owning extensive hectares of vineyards, many in the choicest appellations.\n\nAmong the negoce-Domaines, my favourites are Joseph Drouhin, Louis Jadot and Faiveley, all of whom I visited last month. I think that the notion that the best Burgundies come only from the Domaines rather than the negoce-Domaines smacks of snobbery. I have been visiting the aforementioned three annually since 1987, during which period of 27 years my host in all three changed from father to son (or daughter in the case of Drouhin). Just a simple matter of natural succession, but not in quality. In all three, there has not been any change in the quality of their wines. All have a huge range of wines, from appellations beginning from the top end of the Cote de Nuits to the bottom end of the Cote de Beaune. One can with confidence pick one from anyone of these three, including in particular their wines from the Cote de Beaune.\n\nA cellar tasting in any one of these is like an endurance test, an obstacle race or a marathon - or all of them. But nevertheless huge lessons in Burgundy were learnt, perhaps a bit too much in one go. (I was in all three of them last month to look at the 2013 and other recent vintages.) What is remarkable in all three is that the same high level of quality is found throughout all the barrels tasted.\n\nI have selected two negoce-domaine houses this week to give an idea of the quality and style of their wines, which has remained unchanged at the same high and consistent level year after year. As regards availability, if one confines one's selection for all three negoce-domaines to their wines from the less-popular appellations, ie wines from the less popular Cote de Nuits and virtually all the Cote de Beaune southwards, they should be more readily available and certainly very affordable. If you ask for a Musigny from either of them, you would face the same answer that you would get from Comte de Vogue or Roumier or Mugnier, ie, \"Sorry, on allocation only.\" Which you would have to expect were you to know that the parcel of vineyard in Musigny that each of them owns provides enough fruit for one or, at most, two barrels of Musigny!\n\nMaison Joseph Drouhin\n\n(Tasted last month)\n\nNuits St-Georges 2010\n\nVery characteristic Nuits, linear, rather on the lean side, but good potential. Very attractive wine with a long finish.\n\nBeaune Clos des Mouches Rouge 2011\n\nGood ripeness, volume and density, with long finish. Great potential. Very good.\n\nCote de Beaune 2011\n\nThis was from down-graded Clos des Mouches rouge! Quite good, with good fruit and length.\n\nPuligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatieres 2011\n\nVery creamy. Good ripeness, big-bodied good freshness, very closed, needs more time. Worth looking out for if you want a good white burgundy with denser taste.\n\nChambolle-Musigny Premier Cru 2011\n\nStill very young, very good fruit, firm and strong, a big wine. BUY.\n\nMaison Joseph Faiveley\n\nFaiveley is 80 per cent Domaine, 20 per cent Negoce (all cask samples).\n\nNuits St-Georges 1er cru Les Porets 2013\n\nDark crimson, nice pinot nose, firm, thick, rather than flowery. Dense, very ripe fruit, compact, linear, all very Nuits in character. Very good.\n\nGevrey-Chambertin 1er cru Les Cazeteers 2013\n\nVery dark crimson, light nose very Gevrey in character, aroma of ripe red berry fruit, strawberries particularly,\n\nClos Vougeot\n\nLovely crimson red; lovely aroma, almost Chambolle-Musigny in its lightness and fragrance; very ripe sweet fruit, good complexity, very good acidity and minerality, good volume.\n\nIn short, apply the same guidelines you use when buying a car. What is the difference between a BMW and a Toyota in terms of function? The much less expensive Toyota will deliver you to your office or next dinner date with the same convenience and in the same amount of time. Less style? Who cares about style? (I guess I can say that at my age!)\n\nTo be continued\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Against Q1, the economy actually shrank 0.8 per cent, which spells risks of a technical recession if Q3 turns out negative as well. Economists - most, if not all, of whom were caught out by the poor showing - have reacted by cutting their forecasts of Singapore's 2014 GDP growth to below 2013's 3.9 per cent pace, as well as questioning the economy's competitiveness.\n\nConcern about the growth outlook for the year, and more pertinently, about the economy's resilience and competitive edge, is certainly not misplaced. But one might note that the Q2 figures released on Monday are flash estimates based on just two months' data; the full quarter's results incorporating the June data will be unveiled next month. The updated Q2 figures may or may not yield a more reassuring picture of Singapore's growth prospects, but it would be fair to say that one poor quarter does not necessarily spell a trend, or in this case, mark an economy as doomed, as it were.\n\nYet, a seasoned economist has, somewhat sensationally, pronounced in a report on the flash Q2 estimates that \"restructuring (is) failing\", with economic activity here losing steam despite a healthier global backdrop of late. Indeed, for a small open economy such as Singapore's, it is critical that it be robust to withstand cyclical external downturns yet nimble enough to ride on the upswings. But implicit in the restructuring drive (ie weaning the economy off big inflows of low-skilled labour) is a tradeoff on growth - not to the point of recession, surely, but chances are, gone are the days of sizzling 7-8 per cent growth. As the economy matures, Singapore is inevitably joining the ranks of the \"developed\" economies (at least in growth terms) for which 3-4 per cent growth is usually considered \"good\".\n\nA few years on, has the restructuring drive paid off, in terms of a more productive and technically proficient economy? Not quite at all. The productivity figures are still downright dismal - negative in the past two years. But equally, it is a little premature to declare that restructuring in Singapore is failing. That's not to say that the manpower policies need not be periodically reviewed in light of the socio-economic circumstances of the day; indeed they must.\n\nAnd a whole lot more needs to be done to spur change to catch up with others on productivity - to get construction firms, for instance, to invest in building technologies or at least study how or why builders elsewhere are rather more proficient; to get Singaporeans imbibed in service culture and good work attitudes.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Polls in the week leading up to yesterday's election suggested the result would be much closer.\n\nBut Mr Prabowo has refused to concede defeat. Minutes after Mr Joko declared victory, Mr Prabowo claimed the mantle of Indonesia's second directly elected president for himself - telling his followers at his campaign headquarters in Jakarta that the campaign would continue to follow the results.\n\n\"Today, it seems Indonesia has given me a mandate,\" Mr Prabowo said, basing his data largely on internal polling.\n\nHe appears to be playing for time, analysts say, waiting until official results are due on July 22 while building a public case for claiming the presidency for himself.\n\nCritics worry that in one of the world's most corrupt countries, the extra two weeks will give Mr Prabowo's allies the chance to massage the results.\n\nBut his chances of success seem slim. Public sentiment risks turning against him, and his parliamentary coalition risks peeling away to Mr Joko as the parties vie to secure positions in the incoming administration.\n\n\"We will see public opinion turning against him,\" said Douglas Ramage, an analyst at consultancy Bower Group Asia. \"The margin of victory seems too wide.\"\n\nThere is the risk of a protracted election dispute. Under Indonesia's election laws, either party can challenge the results in the Constitutional Court. A result would not be due until Aug 24.\n\nBut Mr Joko's victory may be just big enough to see off that risk, said Homin Lee, Asia economist for private banking at Lombard Odier in Hong Kong.\n\n\"The margin of victory seen in early counts more or less assures that Joko has sufficient room to project a national mandate and avoid a challenge in courts,\" Mr Lee said.\n\nThe victory may hand Mr Joko the mandate he needs to embark on far- reaching reforms to help shore up the rule of law and investor confidence in South-east Asia's largest economy.\n\nThe country's most respected survey organisations, including the state- owned Radio Republik Indonesia (RRI), have predicted that with more than 99 per cent of votes counted, Mr Joko has won with at least a 5 per cent margin over Mr Prabowo. RRI reported Mr Joko had won with 53 per cent compared with 47 per cent for Mr Prabowo.\n\nPolling company Saiful Mujani Research reported a similar margin with a margin of error of 0.6 per cent. Kompas newspaper put the win at about 52 per cent for Mr Joko compared with 48 per cent for Mr Prabowo.\n\nThe results cap a meteoric rise for a man who less than a decade ago was a carpenter and a furniture salesman. Mr Joko was elected mayor of Surakarta in Central Java and burst onto the national stage with a startling upset win in 2012 to oust the incumbent governor of Jakarta.\n\nHe is expected to expand services for the poor, strengthen the country's corruption-fighting agency and overhaul the police as well as the judiciary, after the ex-chief justice of the Constitutional Court, Anil Mochtar, was sentenced to life in prison for accepting bribes.\n\nWhile the results were expected to be close, the margin of victory is roughly double what opinion polls had expected on the eve of Indonesia's third direct election for president.\n\nThe result gives Mr Joko the opportunity to woo over parties such as Golkar, that had affiliated themselves with Mr Prabowo's Great Indonesia Movement Party (Gerindra).\n\nGolkar finished second in April's parliamentary elections. Its 91 seats would give Mr Joko's coalition - led by his Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), which finished first in April - a majority in the House of Representatives.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That lone victory, however, was in the final in Buenos Aires back in 1978 that saw Argentina clinch their first World Cup trophy after triumphing 3-1 in extra time.\n\nFast forward 36 years later, and we have an Argentina team that have far from dazzled in reaching the final four.\n\nThey have won their five matches by a single goal each time. Most of those games were largely cagey affairs, with Argentina needing very late strikes to get past Iran and Switzerland.\n\nMessi, the engine of his team, already has four goals in the tournament, all in the group stage, and he will be raring to add to his tally against the Dutch.\n\nWhile Holland will naturally try and stifle him of the ball as much as possible, that could free up some space for striker Sergio Aguero, who has yet to get off the mark in Brazil.\n\nSabella, however, will miss the services of Di Maria the most. The 26-year-old midfielder has been one of the most influential players in Brazil, but he is out of the game due to a muscle strain.\n\nLeft-back Marcos Rojo is available for selection after serving a one-game suspension, which means Argentina's stingy defence will be tighter than ever.\n\nIf ever Argentina needed extra motivation in this semi-final, they will surely be determined to pay the appropriate homage to their former legend Alfredo Di Stefano, who died on Monday aged 88. The former striker, nicknamed the \"Blonde Arrow\", played for the national teams of Argentina and Spain, but never got the chance to compete in a World Cup.\n\nThe best tribute Argentina can pay is to put on a five-star performance worthy of qualifying for the final in Rio de Janeiro. With so much on the line, I expect Argentina to finally turn on the style and oust the Dutch from the tournament with a classy 3-1 win.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He would be hightailing it to an MRT station, in order to catch the latest episode of The X-Files by 8.30pm at home.\n\nToday, however, he heads up Vodoke, a company that makes sure that you will never have to hightail it anywhere to watch anything ever again. His set-top box firm wants to redefine not just how people watch television, but what \"television\" even means.\n\nTo be sure, this is change that is already on the horizon, independent of Vodoke. It lurks on the edges of consumers' habits, as people get snatches of what used to be television content off other screens, from smartphones to laptops.\n\nVodoke's set-top box, which runs on the Android operating system, straddles two eras as a hedge between the future and the possibility that the future might not happen quickly enough. The box is capable of both running pay-TV broadcasts, and streaming the Internet's offerings through apps and its browser.\n\nWhile Vodoke's claim to fame has been supplying set-top boxes for M1's MiBox Internet TV service, it might soon be known for more than that, as it expands its customer base.\n\n\"We are currently in talks with telcos based in Australasia and Asia. As telco (or) cable deals are more complex, this will take a longer time. Discussions, however, are going well and we believe we will get at least one on board before the end of the year,\" Mr Toh tells The Business Times.\n\nAlready, 2014 is set to be the firm's big break-out year, if its projections are anything to go by. While the firm sold about 8,000-10,000 set-top boxes last year, it expects to sell about 10 times as many this year - about 100,000 of them.\n\nAt the same time, sales from its software solutions alone are expected hit US$10 million this year, up from US$1 million in 2013.\n\nVodoke also sells set-top boxes to hotels and hospitals, along with software that lets a room's occupants order meals or check their hotel bill, among other things. In Taiwan, Vodoke services the 335-room Silk Place Tainan and 220-room Silk Place Yilan hotels. In Singapore, Vodoke's set-top boxes can be found in the rooms of the Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital.\n\nThe firm, which turned profitable last year, has already seen revenue soar 30 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2014. \"Our year on year revenue has been increasing at an astronomical rate every year, and this year (will) be a record-breaking year,\" says Mr Toh.\n\nAt the same time, the company is trying to grow advertising revenue which now forms a small proportion of overall turnover. Currently, it derives some ad revenue from a partnership with Yahoo!.\n\nThe plan is to turn television screens that are hooked up to Vodoke's set-top box into display panels for ads when they are not being actively used.\n\nWhile Vodoke intends to dominate the living room through the its set-top box, the market is filled with products built on the back of similar ambitions, from heavyweights like Apple TV, to new offerings like Xiaomi's Internet TV box. Unlike Apple or Xiaomi, however, Vodoke offers back-end services to enterprise customers, and does not plan to jostle for room in the consumer space.\n\n\"(A telco already has) a base of broadband subscribers. I don't want to run into a problem where I sell directly to everybody and always have inventory issues,\" Mr Toh explains.\n\nAt the same time, Vodoke believes that designing its own devices will keep them from being too fungible. One of its remote controls has a keyboard on the back, and a \"share\" button for which it has begun the patent process.\n\nWhile this year is slated to be a big one for Vodoke revenue-wise, the company wants to be bigger, still.\n\nLast year, it turned down an offer from a Malaysian firm that would have valued it at $100 million. \"We have a new target - to be a $1 billion company,\" Mr Toh says. This, he believes, will be within reach by the end of 2015.\n\nHe might no longer need to know where he will be whenever The X-Files is on, but at least he knows where he will be 18 months from now.\n\njoyceh@sph.com.sg\n\n@JoyceHooiBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But will their efforts pay off? BT Weekend looks at the the race for the 'next Tiong Bahru', spotlighting four edgy lifestyle postcodes\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jul 11, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSTRAY cats yawn, before stretching out parallel to the racks of laundry that rust in the setting sun. A block away, two aunties in pyjamas fan themselves as they chit-chat in the public exercise corner, their eyes tracing the younger intruders that trundle by, like guardians of the ground-floor HDB flats.\n\nThese are scenes you'll invariably see as you make your way to Sin Lee Foods, a cafe that quietly set up shop in the sleepy Havelock Road neighbourhood a week ago.\n\nSave for a traditional signboard marked with \"Sin Lee\" in Chinese characters (a hand-me-down from the unit's former coffeeshop tenants that their nostalgia-minded landlord insisted should stay), everything else about the business bear marks of a downtown cafe. Pixie-faced waitstaff wear high ponytails and black t-shirts that read 'Rad!'; a rack of imported Kinfolk and Time magazines feed the worldly appetites of its trendy patrons; and sandwiches on the menu average $15 - 10 times as much as the kaya toast from the coffeeshop down the road.\n\nAre they a misfit? But that is entirely the point, says Sin Lee's founder Sean Lee. Despite growing up in nearby Tiong Bahru, Mr Lee decided to cast his net further afield when trawling for a suitable venue earlier this year. \"Tiong Bahru has become too busy and there are too many cafes there now, we wanted to create something more contrasting in a quieter neighbourhood.\"\n\nLike Mr Lee, a growing brood of F&B and lifestyle entrepreneurs are eschewing trendy clusters in the likes of Haji Lane and Jalan Besar to take up units in long-forgotten residential neighbourhoods such as Dakota Crescent, Bukit Merah and Bedok North. An unfashionable postcode, it seems, has become the latest fashion. Besides advantages such as lower rents, less competition, ample parking and congestion-free streets, these business owners are also hoping to get first dibs on the next hipster hotspot.\n\nOff the eaten track\n\n\"We were not looking for a fashionable area to begin with. As designers, we prefer to initiate something and rebel against the norm, rather than go with the flow, and we love Dunlop Street for its unexplored possibilities for new local businesses,\" says JR Chan of fortnight-old boutique ThreeSixFive on Dunlop Street. The previously scruffy backpacker strip has seen new injections of cafes, pop-up retail stores and even co-working space The Tool Room aimed at creative start-ups in recent weeks.\n\nCiting other cosmopolitan cities such as Hong Kong and Seoul, where cafes can pull in crowds even if they are on the seventh floor on a nondescript building, Fann Hui Ling of nearby Flee Away cafe adds: \"Popular areas in Singapore like Holland Village are slowly being taken over by big commercial companies that churn out cookie-cutter chain outlets every month.\"\n\nCouple this tedium with the burgeoning cafe-hopping culture here, and you get droves of people fanning out across the island in search of the unexpected.\n\nNever mind if the address sounds unfamiliar, Singapore is small enough, business owners say. And there's always Google Maps. Or Facebook and Instagram, the 21st century equivalent of word-of-mouth marketing. Rouse cafe on Dunlop Street, for instance, snowballed over 2,000 followers on Instagram even before it opened to the public in April, thanks to an online video marketing campaign.\n\nOther times, it is not about being fashionable. Some businesses were started by well-meaning residents to plug gaps in the neighbouhood. \"We have always found that the East side of Singapore has everything except excellent speciality coffee places,\" says Alvin Tan of Percolate cafe in Bedok North.\n\nTian Kee Cafe in Dakota Crescent, which takes over a 50-year-old provision shop of the same name, was started by interior designer CK Foo and his wife Jessie, who moved there in 2011. The couple hope more people will discover the charms of their laid-back, breezy neighbourhood framed by old low-rise Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) flats from the late 1950s.\n\n\"One of our objectives is to inject new life into this area and bring back the kampung spirit. In our one month of operation, we've already gotten to know more neighbours than we have over our three-year stay here,\" says Mr Foo of the cafe, which also pulls in expatriates from nearby condominiums with their homemade pies and modern takes on classic kopitiam drinks, such as a double ristretto-infused bandung. Month-old The Tastemaker Store in Havelock Road likewise serves as an informal community centre of sorts. \"Our cafe adds a bit of excitement for long-time residents. We get aunties coming in because they are curious about how an Americano would taste compared to kopi-o, and we're quite happy to explain to them how a mocha is made,\" laughs co-founder Alvin Peh. He took over the space from his retired grandfather who ran a bookstore there for over a decade. \"It's nice when you see several generations come together to dine in the same space.\"\n\nRevitalising ageing estates\n\nBut out-of-the-way areas aren't without their drawbacks too. HDB retail shops tend to have more stringent rules on kitchen layout and the types of food that can be served, and higher price sensitivity among residential patrons translate into slimmer profit margins, business owners point out.\n\nAnd then there's the perennial dearth of labour that plagues the entire service industry. \"Being away from town makes the area less attractive to work in, for reasons such as accessibility and perceived prestige,\" says Jerome Siew of Pan Delight's in Bukit Merah. The upside, though, is that most of his employees are residents in the area who walk to work, he adds.\n\nThere's also the question of how well these forward-thinking ventures sit in old estates. When restaurateur Loh Lik Peng took over the tenancy of Hua Bee coffeeshop last year, for instance, Tiong Bahru residents petitioned him to retain the 50-year-old mee pok stall tenanted within, bemoaning the erosion of heritage icons in the quickly gentrifying estate. Mr Loh eventually settled on a dual-shift use of the space between the stall and his Japanese yakitori bar, Bincho.\n\nOver at Sin Lee, curious residents and passers-by pop their head into the cafe every few minutes, prompting Mr Lee to admit that fitting in wasn't all that easy. \"We do get people in the neighbourhood asking why we open here, and that this is not the kind of food that people in the area will eat,\" he says. But he doesn't let it get to him. \"We were prepared for such feedback. When one is not usually exposed to this kind of cuisine, it is natural to initially dislike it. It will take time. We don't want to dilute our brand image and original business plan by following every suggestion we get to serve Western pork chops or lor mee. We should stick to our guns,\" he adds.\n\nOn how to determine when these emerging neighbourhoods will reach their saturation point, The Tastemaker Store's Mr Peh adds: \"It's not up to me to determine how much is too much - it's up to everyone within the community to decide. After all, I'm only here when the cafe is in operation, but for residents who live here, its an area that they'll have to be in 24/7.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

I am sitting in the garden of Ch\u00e2teau Figeac, our \"home\" in Saint-Emilion, now sadly without the presence of Thierry Manoncourt, a dear friend of 20-plus years who died in 2011. The house and the Ch\u00e2teau go on, with his widow, Marie-France Manoncourt, in charge and fiercely protective of her beloved Figeac.\n\n\"Figeac remains Figeac,\" she said, referring to attempts to take over by huge predators hovering around like vultures! And indeed it remains Figeac, with Madame Manoncourt and her youngest daughter Hortense holding court, with the help of a new technical director and influential oenologist, Michel Rolland, as advisor.\n\nI had last been to Bordeaux two years ago. Unfavourable reports of the harvest in 2012 and 2013 persuaded me that it was time to visit Bordeaux again to assess the vintages for myself. Previous experiences with vintages reported in the wine press to be \"poor\", e.g. 2001, had taught me not to place too much reliance on the press for adequate en primeur buying guidance, especially in difficult vintages. Lay press reports on vintage quality almost invariably seemed to delight in putting down the quality in difficult vintages, e.g. 2001 and 2002.\n\nAlthough Bordeaux had not suffered as badly as Burgundy in that it had not had to endure the hailstorms which damaged or destroyed 70 to 80 per cent of the harvest, nonetheless 2013 was one of the hardest vintages in recent years, resulting in a severely depleted vintage.\n\nA disastrous spring, very cool and wet, led to uneven flowering, coulure, millerandage, and delayed the growing cycle by two to three weeks. This, sadly, set the tone for the year, with severe interruptions of the vintage cycle and the loss of a large part of the harvest due to rain during the flowering.\n\nJuly was fortunately sunny and pleasant, but high humidity and rot in September forced an earlier harvest than normal. Yields were well down - John Kolasa at Rauzan Segla said the harvest was down to 32 hectolitres per hectare. In some Ch\u00e2teaux, the final production of the Grand Vin was 25 to 30 per cent of what was normal. At Ch\u00e2teau Margaux, for instance, it was 17 hectolitres. Chaptalization was widely used - even in Palmer and Lafite!\n\nCHATEAU AUSONE\n\nAt Ausone, where we were received by Alain Vauthier and his daughter Pauline, we learned that their 2013 crop was drastically down by half.\n\nAusone 2013.\n\nVery good. A very firm, very concentrated wine with very ripe fruit; a firm mineral element and very, very long finish. Very, very fine indeed. Glad I bought some!\n\nAusone 2012.\n\nJust bottled. Very dark crimson red, faint bouquet. Very firm, very ripe fruit, very complex, slight tannic backbone. Not as lush as in past vintages, with very long finish.\n\nVIEUX CHATEAU CERTAN\n\n2013.\n\nMerlot 94 per cent, Cabernet Franc 6 per cent, Cabernet Sauvignon 0 per cent. Only 20 to 25 per cent of the usual crop. This 2013 was on the slimmer side of its normal self, but was well balanced and will make good early drinking. The absence of Cabernet Sauvignon was clearly felt.\n\n2012.\n\nMerlot 89 per cent, Cabernet Franc 12 per cent, Cabernet Sauvignon one per cent. Alexandre Thienpont compared his 2012 to his 1985, which was very, very good, a classic VCC. Very dark red with brownish tint, a big wine, lots of fruit, very classic, very good length on finish.\n\nCHATEAU LE PIN\n\n2013 (cask sample).\n\nTotal production: 3,000 bottles only, one-third of the usual crop. Very good colour; a lot of fruit, very soft tannin but very good minerality.\n\n2012 (from the bottle).\n\nVery dark colour, with aromatic nose, slightly herbaceous. Very full round body; lots of fruit, raisiny, black currants. Very long, not as lush as usual. \"Like a feather,\" was Alexandre's description.\n\n2011 (from the bottle).\n\nVery black-red! A lot of vanillin still on nose, very long, very complex, full of black fruit, great minerality, and very long. A great wine.\n\nCHATEAU ANGELUS\n\n2013.\n\nFifty per cent Cabernet Franc from their oldest plot. Very ripe fruit, very good minerality; more classic in style. This is very good.\n\n2012 (from the bottle).\n\nMerlot 55 per cent, Cabernet Franc 45 per cent. Very good; very ripe fruit deeply concentrated, very good minerality, very complex, very long. (Note: This wine will be bottled in bottles carrying the name of Angelus printed using gold paint. This is to commemorate the promotion of Ch\u00e2teau Angelus to Premier Grand Cru Classe \"A\", Saint Emilion.)\n\nCHATEAU CANON\n\nThis Ch\u00e2teau is being extensively renovated and extended by the purchase of additional vineyards.\n\n2013.\n\nMerlot 65 per cent, Cabernet Franc 35 per cent. Black crimson; great density, a lot of fruit, very backward and very concentrated; great minerality and freshness. A lovely wine.\n\n2012.\n\nMerlot 70 per cent, Cabernet Franc 30 per cent. A big wine, currently not showing much bouquet; lots of minerality. Very fine.\n\nCHATEAU PALMER\n\nAlter Ego 2013.\n\nDeep purple red, perfumed bouquet, very sweet, very ripe fruit and good length. This is very good.\n\nPalmer 2013.\n\nBlack purple; faint light nose but even then lovely. Good ripeness and length, but still very closed. Will need lots of time.\n\nAlter Ego 2012.\n\nBlack red-purple. A light but lovely bouquet, rather spicy on palate, a little light at this stage. Just bottled, which explains the rather closed state of wine.\n\nPalmer 2012.\n\nBlack red, lovely nose; very ripe fruit, good intensity and balance, very long finish. A very good wine.\n\nCHATEAU RAUZAN SEGLA\n\n2012.\n\nThis is very good indeed. Very good ripeness, well balanced and good minerality, finishing long and smooth.\n\n2013.\n\nThis vintage contained more merlot. Very rich, quite tannic, more freshness and minerality. Very different from 2012 because of the higher merlot content.\n\nAs expected, the dire reports on the vintage resulted in poor expectations - if you do not go and see (and taste) for yourself. The growing conditions were certainly bad and resulted in a severe reduction in the size of the crop. But what was produced was very good wine. The point is that quality was maintained at the expense of volume. Selection was severe, in some instances, very severe, vide Ch\u00e2teau Margaux. It would be fair to say that 2013 is worth buying en primeur, and I have put my money where my mouth is!\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Police want to prevent a repeat of them setting up camp on Copacabana beach.\n\nAt the Terreirao do Samba, Brazilian beats were replaced by the taunting chants of Argentine fans who sang: \"Brazil, tell me how you feel! Maradona is better than Pele!\"\n\nAlan Risso, a 22-year-old prison guard, said that he had left the Argentine city of Santa Fe, 2,600 kilometres from Rio, with a friend on Saturday afternoon, and they hitchhiked their way north. \"We saw the Argentina-Belgium (quarter-final) on Saturday in a truck,\" said Mr Risso, who sleeps on the ground under the stars.\n\nOn Wednesday they were on Copacabana beach, watching the game against the Dutch on a giant screen with thousands of other football fans at the official \"Fan Fest\". For the final, they hope to find a location close to the Maracana, the home of Brazilian football.\n\nDespite the age-old football rivalry between Brazil and Argentina, Rio's tourism department said that it would unfurl \"a red carpet\" for the 100,000 Argentines expected to arrive in the city.\n\nMany will have to watch the game in bars or public screenings because the Maracana, which was originally built for 200,000 spectators, was reduced to a capacity of around 75,000 for the World Cup.\n\nPolice will be watching out for troublemakers. Before the World Cup, Brazil said that it would prevent 2,100 known hooligans from entering the country. More than 50 have been detained at the border or in stadiums.\n\nAuthorities will deploy some 11,500 police officers around the stadium for the final, twice as many as during the six other cup games played there, according to the G1 news website. The justice ministry said that it would double the number of soldiers to 1,000.\n\nWhen Argentina played Bosnia in Rio last month, some 30 Argentinian fans climbed a stadium fence and pushed through doors to enter the arena. Eight were detained but the rest apparently made it inside.\n\nWhile Brazilians call Argentines hermanos (brothers), they have an intense football rivalry. Nevertheless, Brazil superstar Neymar said on Thursday that he wanted Barcelona teammate Messi to win the Cup, a choice that could anger his countrymen.\n\nMany Brazilians rooted for the Dutch to defeat Argentina on Wednesday. In turn, Argentines have taunted Brazilians about their team's humiliating 7-1 semi-final defeat to Germany.\n\nThree Argentines painted their bodies in the country's white and blue colours. One inscribed the number \"1\" on his chest, another an \"x\" and the last one \"7\".

Very little, yet very much, according to Ivan Yeo of Jalan Besar's latest dining spot, The 1925.\n\n\"Running a restaurant was never really a definite goal I was working towards, yet everything I've done has led to this,\" the former head of a mobile gaming agency remarks.\n\nGranted, the microbrewery-restaurant has only been open for six weeks and is still undergoing many changes: its second-floor wine lounge cum communal dining area (a large central table seats up to 20) was only opened this week, its wine racks will only be set up in a fortnight, and its alcohol licences are still pending before the restaurant can serve the light and dark pilsner beers produced by its on-site microbrewery.\n\nStill, Mr Yeo concedes: \"It's a different kind of stress. I can sleep much better now.\"\n\nAfter dabbling in the design industry for close to two decades, from website development to interactive multimedia design and even social media marketing, the 33-year-old was last heading a mobile application development company, which he spun off from a larger group in which he was creative director.\n\nHe observes: \"In the design industry, after you deliver a project to a client, you still have to continue to make sure your campaign or website works well, but it is then also left in the hands of many people, which makes it open to potential problems beyond your control.\"\n\n\"F&B is a tangible business that appeals to many senses, you can see, smell and taste the food to determine its value. For design, most people only judge the final product visually, so you constantly have to justify the value of your intangible ideas,\" Mr Yeo further muses.\n\nAt one point in his earlier career, he branched out into interior design with a local furniture company, where a part of his responsiblity was to oversee the company's F&B spin-off, a cafe in Tiong Bahru. It was also there where the first roots for The 1925 were sown, Mr Yeo recalls. A few friends had gathered at the cafe to knock back his uncle Yeo King Joey's homebrewed craft beers post-dinner some time last year, and encouraged the younger Mr Yeo to run his own microbrewery. (Uncle King Joey, an aeronautical engineer by day, now oversees the four 600-litre tanks of beers on the restaurant's ground floor.)\n\nIt didn't matter to the Yeos that none in the family have any F&B experience. While there are indeed challenges as a relatively unknown name, such as food suppliers often wanting cash on demand - which results in a tighter cashflow and a higher chance that some items on the menu will run out - Mr Yeo admits, the upside is that \"we will never know whether we are doing things right\". \"This means we won't do things the usual way, which is refreshing for our customers,\" he says.\n\nUnusual items on the menu include the crispy egg aglio olio ($16), a chilli and garlic-tinged spaghetti coiffed with wisps of the crispy fried eggs typically seen in zichar dishes, or the raw Canadian oyster shooters ($10 for two) that you knock back with a shot of Alaskan smoked salmon vodka and a sprig of thyme. In place of dessert, pick from a span of dessert-inspired cocktails like the gula melaka and pandan-tinged Zoot Soot Riot ($16) or the Ziegfield Follies ($16), which blends vanilla vodka, strawberry puree with strawberry ice-cream topped with parmesan cheese cookie crumbs.\n\nDoes he miss the design industry? \"Instead of designing for customers, I am now my own client, I design for myself,\" he laughs. \"It doesn't get better than that.\" This gives him the full creative freedom to mull over the littlest details in the restaurant, from embossing sunken edges on the restaurant's cardboard coasters to prevent water from spilling out, to gold-rimming its beer mugs, and custom-making the metal lamps and vintage furniture that kit out the lofty second floor.\n\n\"Game design is a lot about understanding consumer mentality and behaviour manipulation. We build a virtual environment and create stimulus that make players feel stressed or upset and act a certain way,\" observes Mr Yeo. \"In F&B, we are similarly building a restaurant environment - and changing factors such as lighting, music and pricing - but instead with the aim of making people happy.\"\n\nTapping on his social media marketing experience, plates are also intentionally plated according to a brand-conscious, Instagram-friendly template, Mr Yeo says. If it's all starting to sound a little too Truman Show to you, well, Shakespeare did once say that all the world's a stage...\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Armed with a college journalism degree and work experience writing for a Maytag company magazine, she took an entry-level job assisting Fortune's male writers.\n\nThe young woman, Carol Loomis, navigated the magazine's \"Mad Men\"-like culture, on one occasion slapping a married colleague whom, she delicately recalled, \"had an agenda\". She proved herself as a reporter but had to battle gender stereotypes. In 1970, she fought her way into an Economic Club of New York dinner after its director said he did not want \"any frivolous little Smith girls looking for a free dinner and the chance to spend an evening with 1,200 men in black tie\".\n\nAfter 60 years at Fortune, Ms Loomis is retiring as one of the United States' most venerated financial journalists, with a collection of work that reads like a history of modern Wall Street.\n\n\"She has an analytical mind, and she keeps learning,\" said Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor and a close friend. \"We males never do that. We quit at about 15. We just think we know it all. At 85, she is interested in learning more.\"\n\nIn the 1960s, she wrote one of the first articles about hedge funds. She reported two cover articles on the risk of derivatives in the mid-1990s, long before those instruments contributed to the near collapse of the global economy. A 1999 piece, \"Lies, Damn Lies and Managed Earnings\", presaged the wave of accounting scandals a few years later. On Monday, Fortune will publish her final article before she retires, a piece about one of the world's most powerful financiers, Laurence Fink of BlackRock.\n\nMs Loomis is perhaps best known as Mr Buffett's Boswell. She has been Fortune's resident expert on Mr Buffett since meeting him in 1966, and each year edits the annual shareholder letter of Mr Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway - an unusual role for a financial journalist. The two speak nearly every business day and are frequent bridge partners, playing mostly over the Internet.\n\nShe will have more time now for bridge. At her age, she said, it was becoming too difficult to jump on a plane and take extended trips to write the deeply reported, lengthy magazine features that she worked on throughout her career.\n\n\"I began to realise that some of the things that a Fortune writer needs to do, just take for granted, become a little bit harder at this age,\" said Ms Loomis, seated in a Fortune conference room Wednesday. \"I didn't want to be a Fortune writer who was constrained in any way.\"\n\nMs Loomis stressed that her departure had no connection to the recent spinoff of Fortune's parent company, Time Inc, from the media conglomerate Time Warner. In fact, she said she was never fond of Time Inc's 1989 merger with Warner Communications.\n\n\"I think it's good that we're out here on our own, don't have to send money to Time Warner, and we sent a lot of money to Time Warner,\" Ms Loomis said.\n\nWhen Ms Loomis started at Fortune, she was surrounded by journalistic luminaries. The magazine's masthead included Hedley Donovan, who would go on to succeed Henry Luce as the editor-in-chief of Time Inc. William Whyte - author of The Organization Man, the seminal book about corporate culture - and the famed photographer Walker Evans were also on the magazine's staff.\n\nShe soon became a luminary herself. Among her influential articles was a 1966 story about another former Fortune employee, Alfred Winslow Jones, considered the father of the hedge fund industry. For decades, readers contacted Fortune for copies of the piece to use as a blueprint for using hedging techniques to make money on both rising and falling stocks. Ms Loomis cast something of a sceptical eye on Jones' fund, calling his record in forecasting the market \"only fair\".\n\nAlan Farnham, a former Fortune writer who worked at the magazine during the 1980s and 1990s, said Ms Loomis taught him how much work went into producing great journalism. He worked for her as a researcher and remembers her arriving at the office with a suitcase of documents and poring over them for days.\n\n\"She would research something to the nth degree before any of the interviewing started,\" Mr Farnham said. \"It was evident by every word and deed that she was committing herself to an uninterrupted siege of work.\"\n\nFortune's editors helped Ms Loomis over her six-decade career - she is Time Inc's longest-serving employee - by allowing her a flexible schedule. In 1968, after she had her second child, her editors let her take summers off. As she hit her mid-60s, she cut her schedule to working seven months a year. And last year, Andrew Serwer, Fortune's managing editor, agreed to cut back her output to three lengthy features a year.\n\n\"We wanted to keep her, and we wanted to keep her happy,\" Mr Serwer said. \"You should be flexible for your most important employees.\"\n\nShe was introduced to Mr Buffett by her husband, John, a retired partner at First Manhattan, the New York investment manager. The couple, married 54 years, are longtime Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. They raised two children in Larchmont, New York, the Westchester County suburb where they still live.\n\nNow that she is officially retired, Ms Loomis said she hoped to first catch up on the lunches she missed while finishing her article on Mr Fink and BlackRock. She also needs to find a place for the nine boxes of reporter's notes cluttering her garage. And she looks forward to playing more golf and bridge.\n\nMs Loomis also plans to continue her regular conversations with Mr Buffett and assist him with his writings. After editing the Berkshire Hathaway shareholder letter for nearly 40 years, she likes to remind Mr Buffett that he still needs her help. She said that dangling participles and the passive voice were persistent problems.\n\n\"I kid him,\" she said, \"that he missed the class on active verbs.\" NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

German carpenter Till-Oliver Kautz believes that apart from crystal chandeliers, artworks and photographs, \"good hand-made furniture\" does the trick too. Mr Kautz is now based in Singapore, but says that back in Germany, he has built \"many dining and coffee tables that are now the centrepieces of homes. Mass produced furniture will probably find it harder to take the spotlight\".\n\nHe started +49 Woodcraft with his girlfriend Fiona Wong. The number is a reference to the country code for Germany. \"Fiona is Singaporean and loves furniture while I am a carpenter, so it feels very natural to come together to form +49, bringing traditional German wood crafting to Singapore,\" says Mr Kautz.\n\nOn his research trips to Singapore last year, Mr Kautz found a lack of bespoke handmade carpentry outfits here. Most, he noticed, are either interior design companies, which did some carpentry by fitting interiors with mostly woodboards and plywoods, or retail furniture shops importing goods. \"I have not seen many good quality hand-made furniture in Singapore,\" he says.\n\nMr Kautz comes from a family of makers. His grandfather was a carpenter and his father loves restoring furniture. \"So I guess the love for making things runs in my family,\" says Mr Kautz, who attended carpentry and joinery school in Germany, specialising in wood work.\n\nHe is drawn to wood work because \"it feels great to be able to give shape and form to these beautiful and natural raw materials\". He prides himself on having the ability to design and physically craft pieces with full understanding of the techniques required. It helps too that his clients have often commented on his refined handwork. \"I attribute that to the skills gained through strict training in Germany and more than 15 years of passionate wood work.\"\n\nPieces done by +49 Woodcraft fall under two categories: one of which is client-driven, so the couple design and build customised furniture from scratch. The other range is born out of the couple's own ideas, which could be built from scratch or restored pieces made for sale.\n\nAn example of the latter is a Chinese antique side table with three drawers, which the couple revamped Pop Art style and with a hand-made blue-tooth enabled stereo, replacing the centre drawer. \"We modernised it and adapted it to current lifestyle needs,\" says Mr Kautz.\n\nMr Kautz personally handmakes and restores each piece. He works out of a collaboration space at Tai Seng Avenue.\n\n\"Hand made pieces means that every piece is different. Even if we were duplicate them, it is never truly uniform,\" says Mr Kautz.\n\n\"Each piece is defined by what I am feeling and what I am seeing at that moment. There is possibly a lot of soul and humanness in it compared to mass produced ones.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By AMIT ROY CHOUDHURY\n\nPublished Sun, Jul 6, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE communications mindshare in enterprises is dominated by mobility and Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) strategies in which employees bring their own devices, particularly smartphones, to work. Interestingly, despite this, a good Unified Communications (UC) strategy still revolves around the humble desktop phone. Global studies have shown that the desktop phone plays a critical role as 70 per cent of employees still spend at least 4-5 days a week working from a desk using \"traditional\" tools to communicate.\n\nJan Zuurbier, head of global sales at Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise, notes that this is testament to the large role \"traditional tools\" such as desktop phones still play in enterprise communications today. \"With rapid advancements in technology, users now have with a wide variety of choices in terms of communication medium, each offering its own unique advantages.\"\n\nAlcatel-Lucent Enterprise provides advanced communications and networking solutions to companies worldwide. The solutions range from data centre switching solutions, business telephony and cloud communications to UC solutions, the official notes. \"Currently, we work with 2,200 partners in more than 130 countries to deliver innovations that help more than 500,000 customers increase customer satisfaction, enhance employee productivity and improve operational efficiency.\"\n\nSpeaking to BizIT, Mr Zuurbier notes that a good UC strategy can help enterprises optimise their varied communications infrastructure.\n\nConvergence\n\n\"UC is basically the convergence of multiple communication tools such as Internet Protocol (IP) telephony, emails, SMS, video conferencing, and instant messaging, among others, onto a single platform.\"\n\nHe added that a study by MarketsandMarkets has predicted that UC-as-a-service will hit US$7.6 billion globally by 2018. \"This indicates a strong industry endorsement of the benefits it brings - such as the ability for workers to seamlessly transition from one communication channel to another without disruption, and the positive effects on workplace productivity.\"\n\nGiving an example, he notes that a user will be able to bring a call instantaneously from a mobile phone to a desktop phone to enjoy better call quality and reliability. \"Technologies such as Alcatel-Lucent's OpenTouch solutions provide the 'glue' which ties the disparate communication channels together to make this rapid session shift possible.\"\n\nMr Zuurbier has a lot of nice things to say about desktop phones: \"Beyond being known for their reliability, desktop phones are now multi-functional and offer new features that contribute to a mobile work environment.\"\n\nFor instance, desktop phones offer unparalleled call quality, enabling the caller to literally sound as if they are seated in the same room, he adds. \"They also boast user-friendly navigation such as integrated alphabetical keyboards, dedicated function keys and backlit displays, which make reaching contacts even easier. Additional in-built Bluetooth technology also allows for the use of wireless headsets to facilitate flexibility and mobility within the workplace.\"\n\nThe effect of this evolution is evident in the projected growth of sales of desktop phones by Frost and Sullivan: the worldwide shipment of IP desktop phones is estimated to grow at an average rate of about 9.6 per cent between 2011 and 2018, Mr Zuurbier says.\n\nHe adds that security is an important factor behind why desktop phones remain relevant in the communications ecosystem. \"According to a global study by Frost & Sullivan last year, mobile devices were ranked as the third highest threat to workplace security. With numerous threats lurking in the world of mobile and BYOD, desktop phones offer a more secure and controllable environment for communication in the workplace.\"\n\nMr Zuurbier observes that the future of the desktop phone lies in three main areas:\n\nVoice on the line\n\n\"We may in the near future, however, see some enterprises adopt a hybrid approach, deploying both mobile and desktop devices. Either way, it seems that desktop phones are not going away anytime soon and will continue to constitute a crucial component in the enterprise communications ecosystem.\"\n\nThe official adds that communication remains essential in business and it's often a voice on the line that helps business move forward. \"Speaking with our customers, from SMBs (small and medium-sized businesses) to large- sized enterprises, we hear that the majority of employees still rely on solid, trusted tools like a desktop phone. We are meeting this need with the next generation of business communications by delivering the 'deskphone evolved', which provides high-quality audio and desirable, practical features that give employees a high-quality communications experience.\"\n\nThe company also develops a rich ecosystem of solutions and technology partners to meet the needs of organisations in the marketplace, be it small or large enterprises, or private or public entities. \"We are entering an era where the customer is reshaping the enterprise landscape. Customers are now driving technology changes both at home and in the enterprise. Social networks, mobile devices and the burgeoning use of visual content will continue to redefine the way people communicate in their personal lives as well as at work,\" Mr Zuurbier adds.\n\namit@sph.com.sg\n\n@AmitRoyCBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In fact, one of the reasons that the ISIL has been winning support among members of the Sunni minority has been the failure of Mr Maliki who rules over a Shiite-dominated government to provide the Sunnis with more opportunities in sharing power in Baghdad.\n\nMoreover, it's not clear if and how US interests will be advanced through a deepening military intervention in Iraq where its partners the Saudis have been supplying assistance to the anti-American jihadists in Iraq while Iran, which continues to pose a threat to the Israelis and the Saudis, has been aiding the supposedly pro-American regime in Baghdad.\n\nHence, with so many regional players - governments as well as ethnic, sectarian and tribal groups - being drawn into these conflicts and as alliances continue to shift, the ability of the US to determine or even affect the outcome of the civil war in Iraq is limited.\n\nAnd at a time of sluggish economic recovery and continuing cuts in the US defence budget and with no clear signs that Washington has been effective in implementing its strategy of \"pivoting\" to East Asia, the notion of the US being dragged into a new ground war - a third one - in Iraq, which could degenerate into a full-blown regional war, does not make sense.\n\nUnder these conditions, the limited steps taken by the Obama administration in response to the crisis in Iraq, which include the dispatch of about 300 military advisers and a commitment to use American air power under some conditions, seem appropriate.\n\nMr Obama and his aides recognise that, as in the case of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Washington cannot force the major players in Iraq to make peace. What the Americans can try to do is to prevent the civil war from spilling into other parts of the Middle East and to be ready to help negotiate a ceasefire and reach a deal if and when the Shiites, the Sunnis, and the Kurds are ready to do that. Accepting the reality on the ground as it continues to evolve may be an imperfect option, but the only realistic one.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will also not involve any changes to the total number of shares, and hence does not affect the firm's net tangible asset per share, earnings per share and gearing ratio.\n\n\"With the writing off of the accumulated losses, the company would be in a better position to declare future dividends, once it returns to profitability,\" it said in an announcement yesterday.\n\nTranscu shares closed unchanged yesterday at 0.2 cent and was the third most active counter with 110 million shares worth some $181,000 done.\n\nTo yank itself out of the SGX watch-list, a dreaded status it earned after posting losses for three straight years and having a market capitalisation below $40 million, Transcu announced a revival plan in April involving a reverse takeover by Straits Construction Group - a privately held firm controlled by founder and chairman Wong Swee Chun and family.\n\nThe deal, worth between $325 million and $338 million, will involve injecting Straits Construction's business into Transcu which will be satisfied by issuing new Transcu shares at 50 cents a piece - the minimum issue price under listing rules.\n\nAfter the completion of the proposed acquisition, Transcu will have an estimated 20.4 billion shares with a share capital of $1 billion.\n\nTranscu has also proposed a series of corporate actions for the deal to proceed.

These are not scores we can be proud of.\n\nHowever, Singapore is not without examples of proactive shareholders who take up the cudgel and seek to influence matters in an effort to increase shareholder value.\n\nThis can be done through open confrontation, such as when the hedge fund, Laxey Partners, requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting of the then SGX-listed United International Securities Ltd in 2010 to demand that its board take steps to reduce the discount to net asset value at which its shares were trading and to remove four directors from its board.\n\nAlternatively, it can be done without too much fanfare such as when the long-serving chairman of Robinsons & Co was surprisingly booted out of office at the 2006 annual general meeting with the help of the votes of Aberdeen Asset Management.\n\nBoth examples demonstrate that it is the institutional investor that usually makes the difference. Unlike the typical retail investor, the institutional investor is sophisticated, has resources at its disposal, as well as the international experience and the investing clout to push for change and improve governance in their investee companies.\n\nFor this reason, the UK Financial Reporting Council (FRC) developed the world's first Stewardship Code in 2010 to improve the quality of institutional investor engagement. Because it targets institutional investors, the Stewardship Code differs from other corporate governance codes which are aimed at listed companies.\n\nThe UK Code is not prescriptive. Rather, it sets out broad principles and guidelines that encourage institutional investors to (among other things):\n\nThe impetus for this initiative was the failure of institutional investors to adequately engage with their investee companies, a failure which was seen as a significant contributory factor to the cataclysmic financial crisis of 2008.\n\nThe Stewardship Code functions on a voluntary basis, with asset managers, insurance companies, pension funds and institutional investors registering with the FRC as signatories to the Code. While the decision on whether to apply the Code is voluntary, the UK securities regulator requires licensed funds and asset managers to state whether they apply the Code, and if they do not, to explain why they consider it inappropriate for their investment strategy.\n\nThis \"comply or explain\" approach is largely similar to that of Singapore's own Code of Corporate Governance for listed companies.\n\nOne challenge to increasing the level of investor responsibility in Singapore is the structure of our legal system: our shareholders have no duties or obligations, only rights.\n\nUnder Singapore law, it is the board of directors that has the burden of managing the company and the fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the shareholders as a whole. Shareholders, on the other hand, are free to consider their own selfish interests, and to exercise their votes in whichever manner they choose, without being accountable to the company or other shareholders.\n\nThis dated view is changing in the developed world. It is now recognised that larger shareholders should play their part not just in supporting the performance of their investee companies, but also the broad markets in which they invest so as to help foster sustainable growth and job creation.\n\nEver since the UK blazed the way with its Stewardship Code, South Africa, Canada, the Netherlands, Switzerland and others across the European Union have followed suit. Asia is not far behind, with Japan issuing its version in February this year and Malaysia launching a consultation paper on its inaugural Code for Institutional Investors in January.\n\nIn Singapore, our 2012 Code of Corporate Governance introduced, largely as an after-thought, a one-page statement on \"the role of shareholders in engaging with companies in which they invest\". The problem was that the statement included an express qualifier that it did not form part of the Singapore Code proper, making it less effective than it could have been.\n\nA stewardship code is a key missing piece of the governance jigsaw puzzle in Singapore. It is a useful instrument to help build a critical mass of engaged institutional shareholders as responsible members of the corporate governance ecosystem with a longer term mindset. It is time that Singapore stopped playing catch up and take the lead in this part of the world in this area of corporate governance.\n\nThe writer is the first vice-chairman of the Singapore Institute of Directors\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However, in the absence of genuine buying, the index drifted to a net loss of 0.9 point at 3,272.25. The index was virtually unchanged for the week. Turnover through the five days was poor, with yesterday's haul being 2.06 billion shares worth $863 million.\n\nSupport for the STI between Wednesday and Friday came largely from a push by United Overseas Bank. In yesterday's session, the bank's counter rose 30 cents to $23.80, propping the STI up by about four points.\n\nBrokers said UOB's performance was unusual, but explained possibly by broking firm recommendations. For example, Macquarie Warrants (MW), in its daily newsletter yesterday, noted that UOB was the top pick of Macquarie Equities Research (MER), as MER sees good potential for UOB to maintain the highest underlying profitability profile among the Singapore banks.\n\nMER has an \"Outperform\" on DBS, but rates OCBC an \"Underperform\" because of its impending purchase of Hong Kong's Wing Hang bank, a deal which poses \"substantial capital uncertainties\".\n\nThere was plenty of activity in the penny segment, with familiar names from the offshore marine sector such as Mirach Energy and Charisma Energy in play. Hailing from the same sector is RH Petrogas, the shares of which rose 5.5 cents to 81.5 cents over the week. The company said in May that its controlling shareholders were in talks to sell their shares; last month, it reported that the talks were off.\n\nOther low-priced issues which caught the eye were KLW, Polaris and Adventus. Early in the week, the Singapore Exchange had asked construction firm PSL Holdings for the reasons behind a large volume spike in its shares. When the company said it could not explain it, the SGX issued a \"Trade With Caution\" notice.\n\nIn yesterday's session, SGX asked Manhattan Resources why its shares had collapsed 6.5 cents or 10.8 per cent to 53.5 cents with 2.5 million traded. The company had not replied before trading ended for the day at 5pm.\n\nFinancial research firm Ideaglobal said in its daily notes yesterday that the US Treasury market is probably a good indicator of the market's take on the payrolls report.\n\nIt said: \"The moderate rise in yields is consistent with a view that Q2 Gross Domestic Product should now be reasonable, but crucially, that wage inflation still remains controlled.\n\n\"This is critical for the Fed, as the lower unemployment rate and jobs growth could take time to translate into wage inflation and then an upward CPI trend. The July 30 FOMC statement is likely to be consistent with its relaxed message in June, and no real surprises should be seen in the June FOMC minutes released on July 9 either.\"\n\nRabobank yesterday noted that when US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen spoke at an event on Wednesday, she had said that interest rate policy was ill-suited to countering financial-stability risks as the potential cost to the economy was likely to be too great. Instead, she argued that the resilience of the financial system to these risks should be bolstered via a macro-prudential policy approach, said the bank.\n\nNoting that this only reinforced the notion that the Fed is willing to tolerate higher and higher asset prices, Rabobank said the longer the \"real\" economy refuses to respond to rising asset prices, the larger the disconnect between markets and fundamentals and, by extension, the greater the risk that bubbles will form.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It has a remaining lease of 57 years.\n\nSavills, the sole marketing agent, announced the sale yesterday but did not disclose the client.\n\nSavills Singapore's managing director Steven Ming said that the property, located next to the HDB Hub, is along the \"best stretch of shops there\".\n\nProperty consultants The Business Times spoke to said that high human traffic enables this stretch of shops to command higher prices. For retail spaces, human traffic is most important, said PropNex's head of business space Roy Chong.\n\nERA's key executive officer Eugene Lim said that the space is part of the \"most prime row of shops\" in Toa Payoh Central. Anyone going to the HDB Hub will pass through that area, and the atrium in front of the shops, used for roadshows or events, also pulls in crowds.\n\nCurrent listings on CommercialGuru show that monthly rents for units along this stretch can hit $50 psf; rents in this stretch can be 20 to 30 per cent higher than shops elsewhere in Toa Payoh Central, said Mr Lim.\n\n\"It's not a surprise that the selling price for this shop is at a premium.\"\n\nThe HDB Hub is the only retail centre serving Toa Payoh residents, Savills noted. The hub, integrated with Toa Payoh MRT station and the bus interchange, is also near exit points of the Pan Island Expressway (PIE).\n\n\"Prime HDB retail shop lots are a rarity, especially in Toa Payoh, one of the most populous and centrally located housing estates in Singapore,\" said Mr Ming.\n\nToa Payoh, HDB's second satellite town, is home to more than 109,000 residents.\n\nHe added: \"The defensive nature of this investment also bodes well for the current volatile investment climate. We thus expect keen interest and immense competition for the property due to its location and rarity.\"\n\nSLP International's executive director Nicholas Mak acknowledged that among the HDB town centres, Toa Payoh is one of the busiest and offers high visibility. Referring to the price, he commented that the property will not be sold if it is unreasonable, given that investors can be price sensitive and would expect a decent rate of return.\n\nPropNex's Mr Chong said that if the rental yield is in the range of 3 per cent, the price would be justified. The tender closes at 3pm on Aug 12.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/technology/digital-comes-age-customer-markets-are-being-remade", "site_title": "As digital comes of age, customer markets are being remade", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nAs digital comes of age, customer markets are being remade\n\nPublished Sun, Jul 6, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIN THE world of technology, a lot has happened in five years. Especially when you consider most of it has been clouded by economic uncertainty. When Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, 11 million iPhones had been sold; today, the figure has reached 400 million. In 2008, there were no Android apps, Spotify didn't exist and printers printed in two dimensions. But it's not just the rapid adoption of new digital technologies that impresses: it's what they are being used for and how they are transforming traditional sectors beyond recognition.\n\nThere's no doubt that digital technology has made it easier for companies to respond more quickly, improve productivity, exercise more control over inventories, and boost efficiency. Yet, even as we see how effective cloud, social, mobile and analytics technologies can be in automating routine processes and turning vast amounts of data into actionable intelligence, these technologies are but a prelude to something more profound.\n\nCompanies are using digitally fuelled technology to create new, visionary business models that are unlocking opportunities in entirely new industry segments and opening doors to new customer markets. This is resulting in higher growth than would be possible by remaining tethered to traditional business models.\n\nRecognising the potential that digital can offer, many top executives are quickly moving beyond questioning how to get the most out of cloud and mobility and asking bigger, broader questions - such as \"How do I reinvent my company?\" and \"How do I become the leader in digital customer engagement in my industry?\"\n\nThe research published by Accenture at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, revealed not just how companies are open to new technologies, but more significantly, how they are changing their entire business and operating models on the back of them.\n\nWhile 64 per cent of the C-level executives we surveyed expect their companies to continue to focus on growth within their current industry, almost as many (60 per cent) plan to pursue growth in or in collaboration with other sectors. It's by joining forces with once distinct industries that what we call digitally contestable markets are being created. As companies from multiple sectors collaborate to provide new value and new customer experiences, the boundaries dividing these sectors are dissolving.\n\nNew life\n\nConsumers are becoming less interested in which company or sector is providing these experiences and services. And we are finding that these new markets are offering higher growth than is being enjoyed within traditional sectors.\n\nCollaboration between sectors often starts when digitally-enabled companies find new life through enhancements that expand their products or services well beyond their originally intended use, which attracts new buyers in new industries.\n\nOne of them is Osakidetza, the public health system in the Basque Region of Spain, which is using Microsoft Kinect devices to enable telemedicine treatment of chronic patients. Using the Kinect devices, patients are given new ways to experience medical care and physical therapists can offer remote consultations and quantifiably gauge progress. Therapy sessions can be more frequent, more targeted and shorter, thus reducing costs, improving outcomes and reducing patients' recovery times.\n\nGM originally released its OnStar connected car service to provide access to emergency services, vehicle diagnostics and directions. A little more than a year ago, it formed a partnership with peer-to-peer car-sharing start-up RelayRides. Users can now use this service to rent their vehicles, setting the rental price, and allowing lessees to use a mobile app to reserve the car and even unlock and lock the door.\n\nBroader market\n\nAs life-saving, cost-reducing digital applications - from home healthcare monitoring to the use of electronic medical records - gain traction across the entire healthcare spectrum, it's easy to see how digital technology is expanding traditional healthcare into a broader market that is digitally contested by companies ranging from industries as diverse as software, entertainment and specialist engineering.\n\nWe're also seeing major shifts in the way traditional companies are doing business as they become more digitally enabled themselves. In addition to offering its customers many online buying and service options, 95-year-old British grocery giant TESCO bought a majority stake two years ago in the UK's largest video streaming service, blinkbox, and now offers customers movies on demand and other home entertainment services. And in 2012, TESCO began selling customers tablets, following its acquisition of digital book platform provider Mobcast.\n\nThese companies are doing two things. First, they are embedding digital technology within every aspect of the business, connecting the company with digitally enabled suppliers and customers - everyone who touches, buys or services the company's products. And, they are opening themselves up to new flexible ventures and partnerships with other industry sectors. The digital enablement of companies and supply chains facilitates this cross-sector collaboration.\n\nIt has been said that recent waves of technology are not as fundamental as those in preceding decades, such as the mobile phone or the Internet. I dispute that. In fact, today's convergence of existing technologies and the ability to harness large volumes of data are having a transformative effect. We are beginning to see that, as some companies struggle for their very survival, others enjoy new leases of life.\n\nIn some ways, \"Big is the Next Big Thing\". Large companies are going digital in big ways, moving from being digitally disrupted to become the digital disrupters. No longer are they reacting primarily to changes brought on by start-ups or technology giants like Facebook and Google.\n\nNow, they are the ones incorporating digital technologies, innovating in surprising ways. Large companies are driving disruption in their own industries, even entering new ones. As a result, we will see entire industry sectors reform and customer markets being remade. And the companies that succeed will be those that not only implement new technologies, but demonstrate the courage to reinvent themselves and the products and services they offer.\n\nThe author is Asean Technology Lead for Accenture\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

I wanted to create something quite intimate and beautiful for a man and a woman - where they each also had a small solo. I really wanted to do something special to show off the dancers' exquisite line, passion and delicate movement style,\" she says in an email interview. The piece reflects her love of partner work - with the male and female intertwining in an organic and beautiful way. \"It is quite emotional - and looks at the bittersweet moments of a relationship. It is also en pointe - which I do not get to do so often, and which I love!\" she adds.\n\nSDT's Rosa Park and Timothy Coleman will be dancing the pas de deux on the first week, and Chihiro Uchida and Chen Peng will be dancing it in the second week of Ballet Under the Stars.\n\nWeir created it specifically with the dancers, she says, and it helps that the company had two of her previous works in their repertoire. \"Now I have Jabula, 4Seasons and Bittersweet performed by SDT - so I am very familiar with the dancers. The more I get to know them, the easier it is to make a piece of work that really suits their strengths,\" she says, adding that she likes to work with many different companies and try and create work that suits them individually.\n\n\"I'm always very excited to return and create new work. SDT is one of my favourite companies,\" she declares. \"I'm very inspired by the dancers - and as I get to know them better, I feel better work is created.\"\n\nBittersweet will be among the seven works presented in Ballet Under the Stars, which will return to the stage this month with two weekends of classical and contemporary ballets.\n\nThe company will perform George Balanchine's Allegro Brillante and Theme and Variations, the Asian-inspired Chant by Val Caniparoli, The Winds of Zephyrus and Opus 25 by Chinese-American choreographer Edwaard Liang, and the poignant Piano Concerto No 2, Opus 102 by Edmund Stripe. Most of these works were created specially for SDT and to showcase their strengths.\n\nBallet Under the Stars will be presented at Fort Canning Green from July 18-20 and July 25-27. Gates open from 6pm for picnickers, and the performances start from 7.30pm.\n\nTickets from $20 are available from\n\nwww.sistic.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Upworthy imitator RYOT took things to the next level by asking readers to take action, declaring, \"Fast food loaded with wood sucks, especially since it's part of the reason one in three American children are obese.\"\n\nThis media meme, catching on like wildfire burning up so much delicious wood pulp, is not only alarmist but 100 per cent misleading. The causes of childhood obesity are multiple and complex, but I'm pretty sure cellulose isn't one of them: It's pure fibre, so it contains no calories. Cellulose is a natural component of all plants' cell walls and is therefore contained in every fruit or vegetable you might care to eat.\n\nAs Refinery 29's Sara Coughlin put it in a rare sane response to the \"wood pulp\" hysteria, \"Made up of oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon, cellulose is actually the most abundant organic compound on earth.\"\n\nIt's certainly possible that unusually high doses of isolated cellulose, like those given to rats in the study Mr Cohen links to, could have adverse effects, but there is no reason to think that the small amount of cellulose contained in a McDonald's hamburger is any worse for you than the small amount of cellulose contained in a carrot.\n\nIn fact, given the fact that it's a non-caloric plant-based fibre, it's probably much better for you than most of the other ingredients in a Big Mac. After all, one of the things that almost certainly does increase cholesterol is more well known: hamburgers.\n\nBut the fact that \"wood pulp\" is benign and possibly even beneficial as a dietary additive isn't the only thing that makes the recent scourge of articles odd.\n\nMr Cohen and his many aggregators make it sound as though powdered cellulose is another one of those gross ingredients that fast-food chains sneak into their menu items, like pink slime. But cellulose isn't just in fast food - it's in a huge proportion of packaged foods.\n\nManufacturers put it in ice cream, bread, cheese and salad dressing, among aisles full of other grocery store items. And the reasons for this are not so nefarious: Cellulose has the ability to thicken foods, prevent clumping and improve creaminess without affecting flavour much.\n\nIt seems weird to focus solely on fast-food chains as a culprit of sneaking it into our diets when most Americans probably get more dietary cellulose from Stop & Shop than Taco Bell. This is not to say that fast-food chains shouldn't be more transparent about the additives and fillers they put in their food, as Taco Bell recently was when it posted an FAQ on its website about the ingredients in its taco meat.\n\nNor is it to say that concern about food additives is never warranted. But if anything McDonald's shouldn't be using less plant-based fillers in its burgers - it should use more. - The Washington Post\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

After all, if you've seen one film where windows shatter inexplicably, lights flicker eerily and doors are slammed shut by unseen hands, you've seen them all.\n\nDeliver Us From Evil, a film about demonic possession, paranormal phenomena and things that go bump in the night, uses every trick in the book in an effort to send chills up our spines, but even a half-decent narrative fails to bring it beyond standard fright fest fare. The film, directed by Scott Derrickson and written together with Paul Harris Boardman, is based on Beware the Night, a book chronicling creepy real-life cases in the line of duty by New York cop-turned-demonologist Ralph Sarchie.\n\nAs a result, the film resembles a police procedural combined with an episode of Tales From the Crypt, where hardened police officer Sarchie (Eric Bana, sporting designer stubble and a shaky Brooklyn accent) and his cynical partner Butler (Joel McHale), investigate a spate of odd, unexplained or just plain sinister happenings in their precinct.\n\nThese include a decomposed body in a basement, a deranged mother who hurls her young child into a moat at the zoo and the discovery of walls filled with mysterious symbols and scribbles in Latin text. They are all apparently linked to an incident in Iraq several years earlier, when a squad of marines stumbles upon an ancient tomb with deep, dark secrets.\n\nSo far, it's a pretty ho-hum premise - but then Sarchie encounters Mendoza (Edgar Ramirez), a priest who's handy with a crucifix and who has a devil of a time keeping the city safe from nasty spirits. He realises that Sarchie has a unique ability to detect evil and schools him in the difference between secondary evil (the evil that men do) and primary evil (created by, you know, Satan).\n\nWith Mendoza's help, Sarchie closes in on Santino (Sean Harris), an ex-soldier who, well, just hasn't been himself ever since returning from combat duty in the Middle East. Aside from his weird behaviour, Santino is a non-communicative type who lurks in the shadows and uses body paint in the most damnable way.\n\nThe film has an unnecessary sub-plot involving Sarchie's wife Jen (Olivia Munn), who's supportive of her husband but feels neglected because of the amount of time he spends on the case. Meanwhile, their young daughter (Lulu Wilson) is terrorised by a series of visits from an invasive force that causes toys to move and musical boxes to play on their own.\n\nThe filmmakers pull out all the stops in a grisly murder scene and an intense exorcism ritual towards the end but it's the quieter moments - as well as those featuring classic songs from The Doors (talk about evil incarnate) - that make an impression. Unfortunately, not even Jim Morrison can deliver this movie from mediocrity.\n\nRating: C\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Also weighing on sentiment was the related trading probe by the Commercial Affairs Department.\n\n\"Trading volume is also typically down during the World Cup season,\" said Jessalyn Chen, analyst at CIMB Research. \"However, the average daily trading volume has actually picked up slightly, from one billion shares in April to 1.1 billion in June, and hopefully this is a trend that will continue.\"\n\nDespite the dismal figures on the securities front, there were a few other bright spots for the exchange.\n\nBond listings increased to a total of 45 new bonds, raising about $20.8 billion, which is more than a 200 per cent increase compared with a year ago and about 23 per cent up month-on-month.\n\nDerivatives volume was 8.6 million contracts, down 20 per cent year-on-year but a 6 per cent increase month-on-month.\n\nTotal open interest as at end of June was approximately 3.2 million contracts, close to the same volume as the year before, but down 9 per cent month-on-month.\n\nOverall commodities (including OTC and futures) volume hit a record high of 268,840 contracts, which is a 226 per cent increase year-on-year and up 6 per cent month-on-month.\n\nA record volume of iron ore swaps, futures, options cleared was at a total of 222,448 contracts, up 126 per cent year-on-year and 4 per cent up month-on-month.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Property consultants are forecasting a moderate price erosion - barring a recession or external shocks.\n\nCBRE executive director Joseph Tan attributes the Q2 price drop to competitive pricing by developers for ongoing projects in the primary market, as well as softer prices in the secondary market as property owners are now more prepared to lower prices.\n\nERA's key executive officer Eugene Lim reckons the softening rental market - which has been under pressure on the back of rising private housing completions and a slowdown in new demand due to reduced expat inflow - is also contributing to sliding home prices.\n\nThe 1.1 per cent drop in Q2 is smaller than Q1's 1.3 per cent fall. That was probably due to prices of non-landed homes in the city fringe, or Rest of Central Region (RCR), easing at a slower clip of 0.6 per cent in the April-June quarter compared with the 3.3 per cent slide in the first three months.\n\nMarket watchers believe the RCR subindex in Q2 was probably supported by the launch of Kallang Riverside and Commonwealth Towers, with respective median prices of $2,111 per square foot and $1,626 psf achieved in their first month of launch.\n\nIn all other categories - non-landed private homes in Core Central Region (CCR) and Outside Central Region (OCR), as well as landed properties - the latest flash estimate Q2 price declines were bigger than in Q1 (see table).\n\nThe 1.1 per cent contraction in suburban locations or OCR in Q2 (compared with a 0.1 per cent dip in Q1) is thought to be due to lower-priced units transacted at a number of projects - most notably The Panorama in Ang Mo Kio but also to a lesser extent, Vue 8 Residence in Pasir Ris, Riverbank @ Fernvale, The Tembusu in Kovan and The Skywoods in the Dairy Farm area.\n\nThe pace of price decline also gathered momentum for non-landed homes in CCR - which includes the traditional prime districts 9, 10 and 11, Downtown Core Planning Area and Sentosa. The subindex shrank 1.5 per cent in Q2 after falling 1.1 per cent in Q1.\n\nThis segment has posted the sharpest drop of 5 per cent after five consecutive quarters of decline since its recent peak (in Q1 2013), amid a slowdown in purchases by foreign buyers and investors due to the additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD).\n\nLanded homes - long regarded as a bastion of strength in the Singapore property landscape due to their more limited supply - have also been seeing their prices crumble. URA's subindex for this category eased 1.5 per cent in Q2, double the 0.7 per cent fall in Q1.\n\nSLP International executive director Nicholas Mak attributes the continuing decline to thin transaction volume.\n\nPropNex Realty CEO Mohamed Ismail noted that while buyers will continue to favour reasonably priced homes with desirable product features and location, the private residential market looks to be heading towards \"a more muted growth trajectory with weak demand\". Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR)-\n\ninduced credit tightening will continue to rein in exuberant buying, while softening resale HDB prices are eroding the capacity for upgrading to private housing. As well, there is a plethora of choices for potential buyers.\n\nCBRE estimates developers have sold 4,300-4,400 private homes in the first half. With a limited number of new mass-market projects expected to come onstream in H2, the full-year figure could be 8,000-9,000 units.\n\nKnight Frank's projection is 9,000-12,000 units. Last year's figure was 14,948 units.\n\nAnalysing some of the options for developers, JLL national director Ong Teck Hui said: \"Developers that have not paid too high for land have a bigger margin and can price new launches more competitively to achieve better take-up. They are in a fortunate position.\n\n\"As for existing projects with unsold units, the dilemma facing developers is that there is no guarantee that even if they cut prices by 10-15 per cent, they will finish selling the rest of the project - as demand has shrunk significantly due to TDSR.\"\n\nSavills Singapore research head Alan Cheong said that at this juncture, a critical factor for developers' success is \"how good they are at reading buyers' wishes rather than their needs\".\n\n\"For example, buyers may only want to invest in real estate rather than upgrade so to speak. If this is the case, it is pointless to build larger units so that a family can move in comfortably. Smaller units may be what they want, and with the TDSR and cooling measures still in place, that may be where the market is for the masses,\" he added.\n\nBy thus minting a substantial chunk of units in the affordable lump-sum price range for buyers, developers can maintain, if not inch up, psf prices.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This includes a three-night stay at a track-side hotel, a three-day F1 pass to a corporate hospitality suite, private airport transfers and tickets for exclusive F1 parties such as the one held at Amber Lounge.\n\nThose with a need for speed can tag on optionals such as a half-hour spin in a Ferrari 430 Spider or Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder, followed by cocktails at Marina Bay Sands' rooftop lounge Ku De Ta.\n\nThe more basic Walkabout package from $858 and the Grandstand package from $1,928 offer standard items such as F1 tickets and hotel accommodation, with options on seating and hotel location.\n\nAn SIA spokesman, responding to questions from The Business Times, said: \"Overall, response from the various markets has been positive, and there's a strong demand for bookings around this period.\n\nBeing a global brand puts SIA in good stead to be tied to an iconic sport watched by millions across the globe. This is where SingTel had a tougher time exploiting the full benefits from its association with F1, given its largely Singapore-centric branding, said industry observers.\n\nSIA, on the other hand, is able to offer deals to both locals and tourists.\n\nSamir Dixit, the managing director for the Asia-Pacific of consultancy firm Brand Finance, said, however, that SIA would do better to bundle air tickets, flights and hotel stays in more comprehensive packages to make it easier for customers to place a booking, rather than do things piecemeal.\n\nHe pointed out that, unlike other firms involved as sponsors across the race venues throughout the whole F1 season, SIA is limited to that one race in Singapore each year. \"They need to get as many people onboard (as possible),\" he said.\n\nFor now, passengers need to contact the airline to get a quotation for a package that includes air fares.\n\nAside from the land packages, SIA has introduced special offers for its PPS Club and KrisFlyer members keen on just race tickets alone.\n\nFrom now until Aug 15, a three-day pass for the Connaught Grandstand is going at nearly 30 per cent cheaper at $498, with additional perks such as 2,000 KrisFlyer miles thrown in. The three-day Pit Grandstand is around 15 per cent cheaper at $1,088, while the three-day Club Suite package is going at $6,152.50; the latter comes with sweeteners such as 15,000 KrisFlyer miles, F1 merchandise and a Priority Access pass.\n\nFigures have not been officially released, but BT understands that the title sponsorship could cost SIA nearly $10 million a year.\n\nMeanwhile, SGP's director of corporate sales Shamini Suppiah has said it expects more than 80 per cent of its corporate clients to return to the track in September.\n\nThis seventh edition of the race will be held from Sept 19 to 21.\n\nThe race promoter has introduced new corporate suite layouts, which allow for greater customisation options; it has also tweaked the food and beverage menus to improve its corporate hospitality offerings.\n\nEach year, the world's only F1 night race is watched by an average of nearly 90 million viewers worldwide. The event also pulled in an average of 40,000 visitors during the race week between the years 2008 and 2012. This generated around $150 million in incremental tourism receipts a year on average for the nation.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Reuters contacted the relevant officials at MAS and CIMB, who did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nTaking MAS private could enable Khazanah to restructure it with little interference from shareholders and the powerful airline union, analysts say.\n\nResistance to previous restructuring efforts by the union, which represents a workforce of around 20,000, has hampered the airline's efforts to cut costs and improve competitiveness in the face of fast-growing, low-cost carriers such as AirAsia Bhd and Indonesia's largest private airline, Lion Air.\n\nThe head of the MAS labour union, however, was recently quoted by local media as saying he would support a privatisation if a new leadership was brought in.\n\n\"This (privatisation) will remove pressure from the public, from politicians to the unions, hence focusing on its turnaround,\" said a Kuala Lumpur-based equity analyst who covers MAS but who declined to be identified by name because of the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nMahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's longest serving prime minister and an influential politician, was quoted in local media as saying that taking MAS private was the best option to enable a radical restructuring from top to bottom.\n\nKhazanah should exit MAS upon privatisation and the airline should be run by those who can work with the union to revive its fortunes, he suggested.\n\nKhazanah has injected more than RM5 billion into MAS over the last 10 years, but a series of recovery plans and leadership changes failed to revive its fortunes.\n\nThe state fund tried to cut its stake in the airline in 2012 in a share swap deal with AirAsia, but the main union - Malaysia Airline System Employees Union - blocked a move that would have brought in a profitable airline with experience of competing aggressively.\n\nPrivatisation also has the advantage of being relatively cheap for Khazanah, which owns 69.4 per cent of MAS, thanks to the airline's 83 per cent tumble in market value over the past five years. The broader Malaysian market has risen nearly 75 per cent during the same period.\n\nMAS would have a \"break-up\" value of RM4.15 billion, well above its current market value of RM3.4 billion, Maybank Research said in an April report. The airlines' profitable units include MAS Engineering, Airport Terminal Services and its budget airline unit Firefly.\n\nSources involved in discussions told Reuters in May that the airline and its key stakeholders were in talks with banks for a strategic overhaul that could include the partial sale of the engineering unit and an upgrade of its ageing fleet.\n\nBankers said declaring MAS bankrupt was not a decision the government would likely favour as it could harm the airline's chances of selling off the profitable units.\n\nAnalysts say the airline is set to post another weak performance in April-June as it continues to struggle with flight cancellations, weak passenger yields and high overheads. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM", "images": []}

Each PSV has a capacity of 3,000 deadweight tonnes and is 75 metres in length.\n\nThe fourth is a 200-man accommodation work boat sold to a subsidiary of a new customer, Maridive and Oil Services SAE, an offshore marine and oil support services company based in North Africa.\n\nThe vessels, bearing the American Bureau of Shipping class, are being constructed as part of Nam Cheong's built-to-stock series in the group's subcontracted yards in China.\n\nThey are scheduled for delivery between 2014 and 2015, and will bring Nam Cheong's total orderbook to 25 vessels worth RM1.7 billion (S$660.1 million).\n\nNam Cheong said these new orders are expected to contribute positively to the group's earnings for the financial years ending Dec 31, 2014 and Dec 31, 2015.\n\n\"These four orders, on the back of the contract for two accommodation work barges (AWBs) last week, speak volumes ... about the strength of the upbeat sentiment from the continued momentum of rising E&P (exploration and production) activities around the world,\" said Leong Seng Keat, chief executive officer of Nam Cheong.\n\nThe deal last week was the sale of two 500-man AWBs to repeat customer Perdana Petroleum for US$84 million, with an option to buy two more.\n\nNam Cheong said the executive appointment of Mr Tiong, with effect from yesterday, would serve to strengthen the board in light of increasing demands of an evolving and fast growing business.\n\nMr Tiong, 46, is the son of chairman Tiong Su Kouk and brother-in-law of chief executive officer Leong Seng Keat.\n\nBefore the executive appointment, Mr Tiong was a non-executive director since April 2011. He will assist the chairman in reviewing board matters and supporting the implementation of growth and business strategies.\n\nMr Tiong has resigned as a member of Nam Cheong's audit committee but will continue to be a member of the nominating and remuneration committees. He will also oversee the development of corporate strategies amid the \"increasingly challenging\" and changing offshore marine landscape.\n\nNam Cheong shares closed trading yesterday at 40.5 cents, up one cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.
