That compares with NT$24.2 billion in transactions in the third quarter, according to CBRE Group Inc.\n\nThe Financial Supervisory Commission in August lifted some restrictions including the ban on buying commercial real estate by insurers with financial irregularities. It kept some of the measures implemented last November to control office prices, including asking insurance companies to avoid investing in properties with an annual yield below 2.875 per cent.\n\n\"You have 10 months of pent-up demand,\" Joseph Lin, Taiwan-based managing director for CBRE Group, said in an interview on Tuesday. \"We're expecting a lot of money to be spent in the fourth quarter.\" The value of transactions, including land changing hands, will rise to more than NT$80 billion this quarter, according to CBRE. For the full year, investors will probably buy about NT$250 billion, compared with NT$300 billion in 2012, the Los Angeles-based realtor said.\n\nPrior to the ban last year, Taiwan's insurance companies accounted for about 40 per cent of commercial real estate transactions, said CBRE's Mr Lin.\n\nCathay Life Insurance Co and Shin Kong Life Insurance Co are among insurers that had their ban on property investment lifted this year. The government also said this year it will allow insurers to invest in overseas property markets.- Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM", "images": []}

It's going to be a diverse set of experiences.\"\n\nThis change in capabilities is in direct response to how the business environment is changing, and the evolving expectations the business and the wider market have of the CFO and the finance teams.\n\nJamie Lyon, ACCA head of corporate sector and author of the report, said: \"The survey suggests you can't get away from the need for retaining baseline finance skills, but there are so many more capabilities future CFOs will need to bring to the table too. We already see this now with finance leadership roles today, but it's going to be more prominent in the future because the environment and business needs will demand it.\"\n\nRespondents said a good understanding of core finance fundamentals is still the key. As Robert Mello, CFO of GE Healthcare Greater China, puts it: \"A financial background, coupled with breadth of finance experience, enables you to ask the right questions as a CFO.\"\n\nUpon that foundation, CFOs need to add commercial experience and business understanding. They should also begin to proactively build analytics experience into their career portfolios. \"For CFOs of today and the future, experience in the area of analytics and how it can be applied to bring valuable insight to the business, is now more important than ever,\" said Richard Lundon, CFO, IBM Ireland.\n\nRespondents felt that experience in dealing with various types of business risks, and mergers and acquisitions activity, were the next most important skills.\n\nCFOs should also get closer to stakeholders and become customer focused. Teuta Bakalli, CFO of Pepper Europe, said: \"Managing a breadth of stakeholders is a key skill and it applies across the board, not just to the largest listed businesses. Even future CFOs setting up start-ups will need to be adept at engaging with different stakeholders because you are trying to build the brand, you need to raise funds, you need to be able to remain agile and so on.\"\n\nRespondents also said that leadership, communication, strategy skills and expertise in change management are a \"must-have\". CFOs will also need to prepare for more regulation and broader reporting requirements.\n\nRaef Lawson, IMA vice-president of research, concludes: \"The current crop of finance leaders is adapting to the changing role of the CFO, which requires a broader, strategic approach to the business, and they can see that gaining those skills early on in the career journey will be a major benefit to the future CFOs.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The sustainable development and growth of the world's economy will not be possible without similar sustainable growth in shipping and, therefore, in the entire maritime sector.\"\n\nMaritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) chief executive Lam Yi Young, the keynote speaker, said that the government needs to strike a balance between development of maritime transportation and protection of the marine environment. \"We cannot afford to have development and growth at all costs without regard for sustainability and quality of life, but we also cannot afford to stop maritime development completely, given that (the) maritime (industry) is an important lifeline and an important part of Singapore's economy, contributing some 7 per cent of our gross domestic product.\"\n\nThis is indeed the dilemma facing politicians worldwide; the way they attempt to resolve it will shape the shipping industry.\n\nSince Mr Sekimizu took over as IMO chief a couple of years ago, he has been working on the concept of sustainable shipping; a first draft of a paper was released last week.\n\nIt lists a number of \"imperatives\" or overall goals that IMO, in partnership with others, must aspire to in order to establish a sustainable maritime transportation system. It includes, among other things, safety culture and environmental stewardship, education and training in maritime professions and support for seafarers, energy efficiency and ship-port interface, energy supply for ships, maritime traffic support and advisory systems, maritime security, technical co-operation, new technology and innovation, finance, liability and insurance mechanisms and ocean governance.\n\nThe IMO initiative should be commended, and by forging ahead on the sustainability issue, the United Nations agency is putting itself in a strong position to retain control of the environmental regulation of the industry.\n\nHowever, the concept seems to confuse objectives and implementation, and is largely about the latter.\n\nSurely, the overriding requirement for a sustainable future for shipping is to leave as small an environmental footprint as possible? Achieving that will bring in the many elements that the IMO concept document refers to, but let us not mix up aims and means.\n\nOver the coming decades, unless the scientific view on global warming changes dramatically, the pressure on the industry to cut carbon emissions is likely to increase inexorably. It seems to me that there will have to be some very serious rethinking of the basic principles underlying international maritime trade. We will need to ask fundamental questions about the necessity of carrying vast amounts of goods around the globe.\n\nHeresy? Yes, it sounds a bit like it - even to me. But it might be beneficial to reflect on just how much shipping has changed over the past four or five decades. The increases in ship size and volumes of cargo carried have been phenomenal. The chances are that equally huge changes will occur in the next 50 years, during which three \"generations\" of ships will go from launch to the scrapyard. It would be unwise, though, to assume that those changes will be a simple straight-line continuation of the past.\n\nEconomies of scale and competition have been the drivers of change in the recent past but - and especially in the liner sector - it is questionable whether they have resulted in effective use of resources. The effective abandonment of the liner conference (price-setting and capacity-limiting) system has meant, on average, poor returns for line companies. This, in turn, means that cargo has been moved too cheaply.\n\nIt also probably means that far too much low-value cargo has been transported around the world.\n\nWhile the anti-cartel warriors will fight hard to keep low-cost shipping, the drivers of the new \"sustainable\" age will be working against them.\n\nOverall, shipping has been much too cheap. As pressure increases on shipping to reduce its environmental impact, it will inevitably become more expensive.\n\nAnd that will be no bad thing.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This even after the stock traded ex-entitlement on Sept 19 for a 1-for-2 rights issue at five cents. Some label it a darling stock, citing the volumes that accompanied the sharp spike of late.\n\nSo what exactly is this gem of an investment?\n\nBlumont was previously Adroit Innovations, an e-business solutions provider offering a full range of Internet professional services. In April 2011, it changed its name to Blumont. Today, led by chairman Neo Kim Hock and executive director James Hong, it derives most of its revenue from the provision of sterilisation and irradiation services.\n\nBut its recent financial performance has not been particularly impressive.\n\nFor the second quarter ended June 30, 2013, Blumont suffered a loss of $22.39 million (due to fair value adjustments of financial assets) compared to a net profit of $11.90 million a year ago. Revenue fell 5 per cent to $714,000. As a result, net profit for the first six months of 2013 fell 63 per cent to $8.58 million compared to $23.39 million a year ago.\n\nAs at end-June 2013, its net cash and cash equivalent stood at $2.2 million, a rise of $0.62 million from end-2012, due mainly to the sale of quoted financial assets and a property at Clear Water Residence, Malaysia. Net asset per share was 6.27 cents.\n\nYet, its market value has surged from about $500 million at the start of the year to an eye-watering $6 billion recently, making it bigger than Temasek-linked SIA Engineering and property giant Keppel Land.\n\nAt current prices, the stock is trading at a staggering 446 times its historical price-earnings multiple.\n\nSo, it was not surprising that many questions have been raised. On Tuesday, the Singapore Exchange finally issued a detailed query to the company on its latest trading activity. Meanwhile, investor lobby group Securities Investors Association Singapore (SIAS) also weighed in and demanded a \"spee-dy investigation\" into the unusual share price increase.\n\n\"Shareholders need to know the basis and whether the 8-fold price increase is supported by fundamentals of the company,\" its president David Gerald stated.\n\nSGX noted that since December 2012, Blumont made announcements on acquisitions and investments in nine companies, of which small investments of under A$/US$10 million were made in six companies. Of the remaining investments, the highest involved a purchase price of up to S$48 million. There was also another investment in Brisbane-based copper explorer Discovery Metals, for A$8.76 million in equity and US$100 million of convertible bonds.\n\n\"These announcements may not sufficiently explain the steep increase in the price of Blumont shares,\" the regulator noted.\n\nWhen announcing its recent 1-for-2 rights issue, Blumont said it was to raise about $43 million for business expansion, including through acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and other collaborations. The 861 million new shares were issued at five cents each - a huge discount of about 96 per cent to the volume-weighted average price of $1.327 per Blumont share on July 26.\n\n\"The price of the rights share, which started trading on 26 September 2013, rose from $2.10 to $2.57, surpassing the share price which increased to $2.45,\" said SGX.\n\nIt is good to see SGX shifting away from its typical stock query and adopting a tougher stance.\n\nBlumont has explained that it was in compliance with listing rules and that it was constantly in talks with various parties on growth opportunities. In a further response yesterday, it said among other things that its stock could have attracted international interest and that this could have \"contributed to the tremendous interest in its securities across borders\".\n\nBut the gravity-defying rise of the stock, with volume to boot, appears to defy fundamentals. A question uppermost in the minds of investors is whether the sharp rise of the stock is just a matter of market speculation or whether there is more than meets the eye.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Speaking to public service leaders, Mr Lee stated categorically that a basic trust in the state was essential to the success of major policies that the government has committed to undertaking. As it turns out, there are good reasons why his message of having the trust of stakeholders should resonate with private sector leaders, too.\n\nIn politics, \"Trust me\" is all too often a slogan bandied about during election campaigns and little heard afterwards. So much so that some sceptics divide countries into two groups: in the first, the people don't trust the government; in the second, the government doesn't trust the people. Such an extreme view can be dismissed out of hand. Still, the reality is that democratically elected governments, by definition, come to power on the back of a substantial minority - and sometimes even a majority - of people who did not vote for them. Winning the trust of all citizens is thus a significant challenge.\n\nAnd trust must be earned. That point is clearly not lost on the current administration, with the prime minister exhorting the public sector to uphold the highest standards of integrity, transparency and service.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Columns\n\nEroding US exceptionalism will impact world economy\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nBye-bye America First?\n\nJul 15, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week", "images": []}

It will be fully operational by 2017.\n\nAnd in a coup for Singapore, the company picked the Republic over other cities as the base for its Asian headquarters, which opened recently in Tower 3 of the Marina Bay Financial Centre.\n\nAs a whole, consumer sales growth in Asia for the first six months of this year was 35 per cent higher than in the corresponding period last year; the company's chief executive and president J\u00f8rgen Vig Knudstorp expects this trend to follow through when this year's final numbers are tallied.\n\n\"I've rarely seen the company have a good first half and not follow up with an equally good second half,\" he told The Business Times in an interview yesterday.\n\n\"It's a momentum-driven business and the speed of growth is confirming the strength of our brand and product portfolio in Asia. I'm confident we'll have a very strong year,\" said the man who has been at Lego's helm since 2004.\n\nHe cited South Korea, China and Japan as among Lego's top Asian markets; it is also the best-selling toy brand in a number of key Asian markets, including Singapore.\n\nLego, which estimates that the world's children spend some five billion hours a year playing with its toys, said earlier this month that it won market share on rising sales of its new \"Legends of Chima\" line and its \"Lego Friends\" sets.\n\nWorldwide, Lego posted a 13 per cent revenue increase in the first six months of this year, which Mr Knudstorp described as \"a very satisfactory result\", given that the global toy market had a slow start to the year in North America, Europe and Japan.\n\nLego recorded total sales of 10.4 billion Danish kroner (S$2.36 billion) in the first six months of 2013, which makes the company the world's No 2 toy manufacturer - between leader Mattel and third-ranked Hasbro.\n\nAsked about Lego's future plans for Singapore, Mr Knudstorp acknowledged that the company was not here because of the size of the local consumer market, which is small compared to elsewhere.\n\nRather, he envisions Lego's Asian headquarters in Singapore as a place where some of the company's top management from around the world will be located and eventually call their home.\n\nThe Singapore office already has some 75 employees from 18 countries, and the Lego chief said he would invest heavily in human capital as Lego positions itself to be \"more of an Asian company\" going forward.\n\n\"Today, when I look at the top 250 leaders of the company, the majority are based in the Americas and Europe. Only a handful are of Asian descent.\n\n\"I really want a heavier Asian representation. The way to achieve that is to send a signal to people who live in Asia, to say that they can be a part of this company and this culture without being Danish.\"\n\nLego is controlled by Denmark's richest man, Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, the grandson of the company's founder, Ole Kirk Kristiansen.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There is also the factor of the \"draw for non-Asian-based players to focus more on home markets\", he added.\n\nA PwC survey on private banking said Singapore and Hong Kong banks' cost-to-income ratios are among the highest in the world, standing at an average of 83 per cent last year.\n\nThis is expected to fall to 76 per cent this year and 73 per cent next year.\n\nRelationship manager (RM) costs account for as much as half the cost base.\n\nLast month, Societe Generale (Soc-Gen), France's No 2 listed bank, was reported to be considering the sale of its Asia private-banking arm.\n\nStandard Chartered Bank, United Overseas Bank and DBS Group Holdings were among those said to have expressed interest in the business, though all have declined comment.\n\nMr Malkani, stressing that he was not disclosing StanChart's interest, if any, in acquiring it, noted that Soc-Gen has been in the Asian market for two decades and that this was an interesting opportunity to look at it.\n\n\"We are open to acquisitions, both organic and inorganic. We would be willing to pay for a portfolio acquisition and also a large acquisition which fits our footprint,\" he said.\n\nStanChart made a transformational acquisition into private banking by paying US$860 million for American Express' banking unit in March 2008; that gave it about US$22.5 billion of assets under management (AUM) and 120 RMs.\n\nIn May this year, the bank made a portfolio acquisition in India by buying part of Morgan Stanley's onshore private-wealth management business in India.\n\nToday, its private bank business has US$50 billion AUM, US$35 billion of it from Asia. The private bank has 1,200 staff globally, including 450 RMs; Singapore and Hong Kong have 140 and 90 RMs respectively.\n\nMr Malkani disclosed that the bank is reshaping its private bank model to a more focused approach. It will now accept clients with a minimum US$2 million AUM, up from $1 million previously.\n\n\"We're taking a more focused approach towards this smaller, higher tier of clients,\" he said.\n\nGrowth will be muted as a result of the change; he expects AUM to increase in the high single digit, from double digits before.\n\nOn returns to the business, he said it is improving as more clients turn to discretionary portfolio services. About 10 per cent of AUM are managed in discretionary portfolios, up 50 per cent from 7.0 per cent previously, he said.\n\nHe attributed the shift towards discretionary portfolios this year to Asian markets getting more difficult.\n\nInvestors in Asian financial assets in local currencies have reported estimated losses of 20-25 per cent, he said, so more are shifting towards the United States, in particular equities.\n\n\"But they are less familiar with that (US) market, so they are thinking it is better to leave it to the professionals,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Even as most stock traders shrugged their shoulders, economists warned that a prolonged shutdown would rattle confidence and drain much-needed spending from the economy.\n\nInvestors appeared to take the news in their stride, with the US stock market edging higher in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 12 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 15,141 points in the first few minutes of trading yesterday. The Standard & Poor's 500 index was up five points, or 0.3 per cent, at 1,687.\n\nThe S&P has lost ground on seven of the past eight trading days. The Nasdaq composite index was up 16 points, or 0.4 per cent, at 3,787. European markets were mostly in positive territory, as were most Asian bourses. News of the partial shutdown weakened the dollar, sending it to an eight-month low against the euro.\n\nInvestors viewed the shutdown as likely to be temporary, with its effects limited and already priced into markets.\n\nRepublican House of Representatives leaders, bowing to the mutinous Tea Party faction, demanded that changes to President Barack Obama's healthcare reform package be a condition of passing a general budget bill. The president and the Democratic Senate leaders who supported him refused to reopen the thorny issue of healthcare and looked for savings in other programmes.\n\nThe bell tolled at midnight as the two sides failed to meet an Oct 1 deadline for appropriations and for the new provisions of the health law to take effect. By today, more than one-quarter of the government's nearly three million employees will be sent home on \"furloughs\" - unpaid, indefinite periods of leave.\n\nIf 800,000 people lose their discretionary income for a week, the US economy can lean on some of the tens of millions of salaried consumers. If the shutdown stretches out for a month or more, what is effectively a massive round of layoffs will deal a blow to the economy as similar job losses did during the global financial crisis.\n\nWhile \"essential services\" are not supposed to be affected, some of those furloughed would become essential in an emergency - such as many in the Centers for Disease Control. Furthermore, if the spending freeze continues, many government agencies will suspend contracts with private vendors - a massive business for industrial and technology companies such as General Electric and IBM.\n\nIt is a measure of legislators' ineffective fiscal management that US stocks looked set to rise on the first day of the shutdown.\n\n\"The hope is . . . the shutdown will be short-lived so there won't be long-term lasting effects on the markets or the economy,\" said Sean Simko, head of global fixed income at SEI Investment.\n\nA weekend CNN poll indicated the public will blame the Republicans for the shutdown, suggesting the party will be under more pressure to compromise. Reading into statements by Idaho Representative Raul Labrador, a recent Slate.com piece predicted that House Republican leaders will soon override Tea Party demands and give up the healthcare fight.\n\nJoseph Quinlan, chief market strategist at US Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management, said Wall Street goes about its business as well - or perhaps better - when Capitol Hill closes down. \"Since 1976, the federal government has closed its door 17 times,\" Mr Quinlan wrote in a note to clients. \"The last time the government decided to shut down was in fiscal year 1996 - then, the government actually closed twice, for a combined 26 days.\"\n\n\"And how did Wall Street react to the 1996 twin shutdown? Answer: with a yawn, basically.\"\n\nMr Quinlan's charts suggest that none of the shutdowns in recent history coincided with major bear markets. Similarly, analysts at Piper Jaffray argued that the recent \"turbulence\" was a \"buying opportunity\" and forecast a big fourth-quarter stock rally as the \"uncertainty in Washington subsides\".\n\nFor the long-term budget picture, the shutdown is a sideshow. Neither side has mentioned cutbacks to social security, Medicare or Medicaid that all economists say must happen in order for the United States to balance its books in the long term. While a \"stable fiscal situation\" is likely the goal of both sides, there are \"very difficult decisions that need to be made\" and very different views between the parties on how to make them, said Mr Simko of SEI Investment.\n\nOne silver lining for traders is the effect of the shutdown on Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke's \"tapering\" plan. Mr Bernanke had cited fiscal worries as one reason for delaying the taper in September, and will likely hold fire again at the October Fed meeting.\n\nIn the short term, some of the chaos in Washington, DC is bound to spill over on Wall Street. Staff cuts at the Labor Department could delay Friday's jobs report, for example.\n\n\"If that's interrupted, obviously the markets are going to take it one day at a time,\" said Mr Simko.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

The application then went before Justice Lai Siu Chiu - who allowed it, saying that the members had signed different membership contracts between 1994 and 2004, and therefore failed to satisfy the \"same interest\" or common grievance test needed for class-action or representative suits.\n\nThe plaintiffs then appealed this decision, and the Court of Appeal - comprising Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, and Justices of Appeal Chao Hick Tin and Andrew Phang - set aside Justice Lai's decision, saying it was \"entirely satisfied that there are no compelling reasons not to reinstate (the class-action suit) as a representative action\", but only with regard to certain claims.\n\nIts 75-page document, out this week, also laid out how class-action suits should be dealt with by the courts.\n\nKoh Swee Yen of WongPartnership represents the former club members, while Adrian Tan of Drew & Napier represents Treasure.\n\nThe case has its roots in a transfer agreement between Sijori and Treasure in 2006, which stated that Treasure would maintain various membership privileges including complimentary room vouchers for three nights annually for 20 years, special discounts for room stay, food and beverage and karaoke, and free use of the swimming pool and gymnasium.\n\nTreasure Resort in 2008 terminated its agreement with the members and told them they would have to enter into a new membership agreement with its associate, Colony Members Service Club.\n\nUnder the new contract, the members were not entitled to membership until 2075. In addition, Colony raised the monthly subscription fees 5.5 times from March 2008 onwards, to $165 from $30 for individuals, and to $275 from $50 for family memberships, subject to further increases at Colony's discretion.\n\nThe Court of Appeal ruled that, even if there were differences in the terms of each individual membership agreement or in the privileges conferred on each claimant, they \"do not prima facie preclude a determination of the (seven) representative plaintiffs' claim against Treasure for wrongful repudiation of contract by way of a representative action\".\n\nIt, however, ruled that Treasure's alleged breaches of the membership agreements would not be the same for each claimant; for example, it noted, that in terms of the complimentary room stay, some of the claimants \"did not even assert that they attempted to make use of their complimentary room vouchers\".\n\n\"Accordingly, we hold that the breach of contract claim is not a common issue between all the claimants,\" the Court of Appeal said.\n\nAs for how class-action suits should be regarded, the Court of Appeal said the case brought forth in a representative action will determine the rights of, and be binding on all claimants.\n\nIt ruled that not all interests of the claimants must be identical before the \"same interest\" requirement is met, but that claimants must share some common interests in relation to a substantial question of fact or law. \"To this end, the courts must carry out a comparison of the significance of the common issues between the claimants with the significance of the issues which differ between them,\" it said.\n\nIt added that this will have to be determined on a case-by-case basis.\n\nNotably, it also said the trial judge will have the discretion to refuse to permit a class-action suit from going forward, even after the \"same interest\" condition is met.\n\nThe Court of Appeal said that class-action suits are \"a flexible tool of convenience in the administration of justice\", as they offer advantages over multiple individual suits, namely: judicial economy; cost savings for claimants and defendants; and the prevention of moral hazard in cases where wrongdoers who caused widespread but individually minimal harm might not otherwise have the full costs of their conduct taken into account.\n\nIt also said that the competing interests of the defence in a representative action should not be overlooked.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But the acclaimed comedy Atomic Jaya has proven so wildly popular with Singapore audiences that playwright Huzir Sulaiman and actress Claire Wong get asked by fans every week when they will bring it back.\n\nThe married couple has finally relented to put up a new production this month to appease their longstanding fans - and create new ones. The upcoming production also marks the 15th anniversary of the play that was first staged in Kuala Lumpur to rave reviews. Then, it starred Malaysian actress Jo Kukathas, who has now become a major force in the Singapore theatre scene.\n\nAtomic Jaya depicts Malaysia's attempts to create a nuclear bomb. It follows physicist Mary Yuen, who is recruited by the ambitious General Zulkifli to lead the project. But first, they must source for uranium, which seems to be available only through illegal means.

There had been hopes for a stronger rebound amid recent signs that the economy was on the road to recovery.\n\n\"Although overall manufacturing is stable, development is not balanced,\" said Zhao Qinghe, senior statistician at the NBS in a comment accompanying the PMI.\n\n\"The trend towards improvement for large and medium companies is consolidating, but small companies face difficulties,\" he said, noting overcapacity and weak demand.\n\nThe index - which measures manufacturing activity in Chinese factories and workshops - is a widely observed gauge of the country's economic health. A reading above 50 indicates expansion while anything below signals contraction.\n\nOn Monday, the PMI published by investment bank HSBC came in at 50.2, a whole point lower than the flash version which surveys roughly 85 per cent of respondents and was published a week before.\n\nA breakdown of figures of both sets of data - official and HSBC PMI, shows that while exports are picking up on the back of stronger economies in the United States and Europe, demand at home and business activity of small enterprises still lag.\n\nThe sub-index for small firms fell in August to 48.4 from 48.8 the previous month, the official PMI showed, and demand remained flat according to the HSBC PMI.\n\nIn August, official statistics showed that the Chinese economy was strengthening with industrial production, retail sales and fixed-asset investment all growing. Third-quarter data out later this month is expected also to reverse a downward trend and exceed 7.5 per cent.\n\nBut analysts warned that the rebound is unsustainable and could be short-lived as it is led not by domestic demand, but investment by state-owned firms.\n\nThey also said that China still has to address major challenges such as the predominant role of its state-owned companies or deleveraging its debt before its reaches its stated goal of consumption-led growth.\n\n\"The official PMI for September raises further questions about the durability of China's economic rebound,\" wrote Capital Economics economists Mark Williams and Qinwei Wang in a note published yesterday.\n\n\"Taken together, the two September PMIs suggest that the manufacturing sector ended Q3 less strong than we had initially thought. The upshot is that this does not appear to be a recovery that is set to last,\" they said.\n\nA closer look at the figures shows that for small and medium-sized firms that account for two-thirds of manufacturing output, the last three or four months have brought no improvement in conditions at all.\n\nOther data on the ground points to a rebound which is unbalanced and only felt in certain sectors of the economy. Housing starts fell in August and steel prices have fallen over the last few weeks after a rebound early in the summer. The large-firm PMI also appears to be levelling out. Growth in electricity, another good indicator of economic activity, remains weak.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The industry's traditional peak season in Q3 probably will disappoint, he added.\n\nThe world's biggest container lines - including AP Moeller-Maersk A/S, CMA CGM SA and Mediterranean Shipping Co - have been trying to push up freight charges after fees between Asia and Europe fell to an 18-month low in June. Maersk, the largest, announced four increases in five months. A proposed multi-carrier pooling alliance, a spate of mergers and a move to mothball older ships are all failing to bring the industry back into balance amid subdued demand and a glut of new ships.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

Sure, you're seeing bidding wars because there's no inventory, but properties are still trading at a price that has to make sense.\"\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Property\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week", "images": []}

The call comes even as Blumont replied to a Singapore Exchange (SGX) query yesterday that it was not aware of any unannounced reasons that accounted for its share trading activity.\n\nSIAS said Blumont shareholders need to know the reason for the price rise and whether it is supported by fundamentals. The company is now trading at close to 500 times its earnings over the last 12 months, and about 60 times the value of its net assets.\n\n\"We hope there is an acceptable explanation by the company. If not, SIAS calls on the relevant authorities to investigate this unusual stock activity immediately,\" said SIAS president David Gerald.\n\nFrom around two cents a couple of years ago and an adjusted six cents a year ago, Blumont charged to a historical high of $2.45 on Monday and dipped one cent to $2.44 yesterday.\n\nAt a market capitalisation of $6.3 billion, Blumont is as valuable as Singapore Press Holdings (SPH), twice as valuable as telco M1, and three times as valuable as SMRT Corp, Wheelock Properties, or Venture Corp.\n\nBlumont currently gets most of its revenue from providing sterilisation services to get rid of bacterial contamination of food products. It declared revenue of $714,000 in its second quarter ended June 30 and a loss of $22.4 million mainly due to fair value losses on financial assets.\n\nSince the end of last year, the company has been expanding into the mineral and energy resources sector. It announced a string of investments, including a number of small deals of under A$/US$10 million.\n\nOn Sept 19, Blumont announced its largest deal to date, an A$116 million investment in Brisbane-based copper explorer Discovery Metals, comprising A$8.8 million in equity and US$100 million of convertible bonds.\n\nIn a detailed query to the company yesterday, Singapore Exchange (SGX) noted that the company announced a rights issue at end-July at five cents per rights share, on the basis of one rights share for every two ordinary shares. Blumont raised $43 million by issuing 861 million new shares.

First is the effectiveness of the Fed's communication policy. In recent years, the Ben Bernanke Fed has made it a practice to provide as much \"forward guidance\" to the market as it can, in the hope that adding certainty on interest rates and monetary policy props up Wall Street and creates a \"wealth effect\" that feeds through to consumers, encourages them to spend more and so helps the economy to recover. This in turn has placed investors everywhere on near-permanent Fed watch, sending prices up and down in tandem with every release of US economic data and regular utterances by Fed governors. At some level, this approach has been effective - since the sub-prime crisis erupted in 2008, Wall Street has more than doubled to an all-time high. However, because the Fed had in May led the market to believe that tapering would commence soon, the decision last month not to taper has now created confusion and added uncertainty. Analysts who had grown over-reliant on forward guidance are now not sure when tapering will start - if at all.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Columns\n\nEroding US exceptionalism will impact world economy\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nBye-bye America First?\n\nJul 15, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week", "images": []}

More cargoes will diminish the number of idle vessels and daily rates for long-range tankers, each hauling 75,000 tonnes, will rise 29 per cent to US$18,000 in 2014, the average of four analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg shows.\n\nThe expansion means more exports to Europe, Japan and Australia, voyages that can stretch to 8,400 miles, tie up ships for longer and reduce available capacity in the fleet of 1,324 vessels. Refineries in India and the US are also adding cargoes. The rate forecasts would make the carriers profitable for the first time since 2008 after a glut of ships caused a slump of as much as 93 per cent.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week", "images": []}

Loans growth grew 15.7 per cent, up from August's 15.4 per cent growth.\n\nSaid OCBC economist Selena Ling: \"Overall I think it's a very decent set of numbers, but what we really like about it is the fact that business loans are continuing to accelerate month-on-month. Growth prospects seem to be picking up going into 2014.\"\n\nLoans to businesses grew 1.4 per cent over September to $325.6 billion, after remaining flat in August. Year-on-year growth picked up as well to 18.6 per cent, faster than the 17.4 per cent seen in the month before.\n\nBusiness lending momentum was driven by the general commerce and business services sectors. In month-on-month terms, loans growth for the former rose 3.4 per cent in September after shrinking 1.8 per cent in August; the latter rose 5 per cent.\n\nDBS economist Irvin Seah noted: \"This clearly reflects that businesses are still optimistic in their outlook, and that's also underpinned by the fact that lending rates are still attractive.\"\n\nIn contrast, consumer loans grew a slower 0.6 per cent in September to hit $220.9 billion, after rising 0.8 per cent in August. On a year-on-year basis, consumer loans growth slowed to 11.7 per cent, from August's 12.5 per cent.\n\nThis, Ms Ling and Mr Seah said, was largely due to the government's recent macroprudential measures aimed at curtailing excessive consumer leverage.\n\n\"Consumer loans saw a further slowdown on a year-on-year basis, and the big drag came from car loans which is not surprising,\" noted Ms Ling.\n\nCar loans shrank for a tenth straight month, falling 10.3 per cent from a year ago. Lending for cars was 1.5 per cent thinner in September compared to August.\n\nHousing and bridging loans growth - the largest consumer loans segment making up 74 per cent of the basket - continued to slow, rising 12.9 per cent in September from a year ago, down from 13.5 per cent in August. In month-on-month terms, housing and bridging loans were just 0.7 per cent higher.\n\n\"The trajectory will remain the same in the coming months,\" said DBS's Mr Seah. \"We still see the economic outlook remaining positive in the coming quarters and this will have a positive impact on corporate loans. We also expect policymakers to continue to stay vigilant towards consumer leverage, and to ensure that consumers don't overextend themselves.\"\n\nAdded Ms Ling: \"As for whether we're going to go back to the 20-25 per cent growth rates (seen before), I hope not. Given that a lot of macroprudential measures are in place, that should at least cap borrowing for big-ticket items like housing and cars.\n\n\"Having said that, though, on the demand side there is also a very supportive jobs market. There (are) push and pull factors going on, so I think bank lending is probably going to stabilise in this range going forward.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Many of you will naturally think of zebra-patterned throw pillows, leopard-spotted ottomans and tortoise-inspired mirror frames (and it is true that those elements have been around for some time and seem to be staying put) but those are just the foundation of what we're seeing unleashed on the world of home interior design.\n\nThe animal trend today also means an unlikely return to \"taxidermy chic\" in its most controversial and traditional form (think once-living heads hanging from walls), as well as in much less controversial and much more interpretative forms involving only sacrifices of papier mache, resin, ceramic and wood molded, formed and carved to look like a more abstract version of the real thing.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Property\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week", "images": []}

BT understands that Mr Sin will retain his present posts even after he takes over from Mr Boey.\n\nThe group director of land sales and administration at URA plays an important policymaking role for the Singapore property sector and reports directly to URA's chief executive officer.\n\nThe job involves heading the team that makes recommendations to the government on the number and type of sites to be released under the government land sales (GLS) programme, and advises on new measures that may be needed to maintain the health of the market. The role also includes overseeing the property research and controller of housing functions at URA.\n\nMr Boey has vast experience in planning and policy work, having spent 19 years at URA and the Ministry of National Development (MND). He has headed the land sales and administration group since early 2009.\n\nPrior to that, he was controller of housing for over two years until Dec 31, 2008. He has also been actively involved in real estate work as a council member of the Council for Estate Agencies.\n\nChia Boon Kuah, president of the Real Estate Developers Association (Redas) and chief operating officer of property sales at Far East Organization, said of Mr Boey: \"I have worked closely with Marc Boey and know him as a very hardworking, versatile and talented man.\"\n\nMr Boey, he said, is known to visit showflats over the weekends to keep in touch with the market.\n\n\"He always tries his best to explain the reasons behind key government policies that impact the property market,\" Mr Chia said. \"At the same time, he's also very sensitive to feedback, and is always open to listening to the developers' side of the story, addressing our concerns and considering our input.\n\n\"He engages everyone who has a role to play in the property market - from property agents and developers to analysts and bankers,\" said Mr Chia. He added that Redas is looking forward to working closely with Mr Sin.\n\nKnight Frank executive chairman Tan Tiong Cheng said Mr Boey is a \"capable guy\" whose views on the property market are \"quite balanced\".\n\n\"He is approachable, quite balanced and very sensible,\" said Mr Tan. \"Marc has also been quite open, and has conducted many general and detailed discussions with people in the real estate scene in Singapore, from consultants to analysts and developers.\n\n\"As such, he has a good reading of what is at play in the market.\"\n\nThe 40-year-old Mr Sin has been director of research and controller of housing since 2011. The controller of housing department in URA grants licences to housing developers in Singapore.\n\nHe started working at URA in 1998, and was a property market analyst in his first four years.\n\nHe then spent a year at the Ministry of Finance, before moving on to a short stint as a planner looking at land use issues in the northeast region of Singapore. He has also worked at the Ministry of National Development, where he was deputy director of strategic planning.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Interim revenue was 4.4 per cent higher at $581.1 million. H1 earnings per share were two cents, down from 4.6 cents a year ago.\n\nLooking ahead, SMRT president and CEO Desmond Kuek said the transport operator continues to discuss with the authorities the details for \"a timely transition to a viable and sustainable model for the train and bus business\".\n\n\"We are also growing our non-fare business locally and overseas,\" he added, referring to the Woodlands Xchange and the Jakarta monorail project.

Net profit for the 14 months was $30.5 million. The company has undertaken a change in financial year end. Because of this change it would not be possible to accurately compare 2013 and 2012 figures, said SCP in its results announcement.\n\nProfit from operations for FY2013 was about $17 million and the gain on fair valuation of properties was about $43 million. For 2012's 14-month period, the revaluation gain was $10.5 million.\n\nThe company also proposed a second and final dividend of 1.7 cents a share, making it 3.4 cents for the year. It said that it intends as far as possible for the current financial year to pay a tax exempt dividend of at least 3.5 cents.\n\nSCP has three core businesses - retail gold sales, retail sales of women's apparel and property investment.\n\nFor the coming year, SCP said that it expects its apparel business to continue performing well as the company consolidates its operations so as to have fewer but bigger outlets. It said that its gold business should remain profitable, but rental income is expected to fall slightly as tenants are resisting rental increases. Overall, SCP said that it expects to remain profitable for FY2014.\n\nIn its accompanying press release, SCP announced it is setting up an Advisory Panel (AP) to help it identify new businesses. It will initially have two members - Ahmad Magad who has been one of SCP's independent directors for 17 years and Paul Tan, who was for 10 years also an SCP independent director.\n\nSince 2011, SCP has included 22 questions and answers (Q&A) in its annual report on topics ranging from its operations to corporate governance.

So great was demand that the order books were closed ahead of schedule. Westports' shares were also priced at RM2.50 apiece, at the top of the indicative price range, according to a Reuters report yesterday.\n\nSuch enthusiasm bodes well for an even bigger listing this year - a RM2.4 billion IPO by UMW Oil & Gas Corporation - and is likely to give confidence to other firms contemplating a listing.

It's a three-year-old company, and though it has an estimated 50 million unique monthly users, it doesn't have any revenue yet. Still, the investors behind a US$225 million round of financing that was announced last week estimated the company's value at US$3.8 billion.\n\nTo put that in perspective, the estimated value of Pinterest, based in San Francisco, is about a third of Twitter's. The micro-messaging service could have US$600 million in revenue this year (though it isn't profitable) and is set to go public in a few weeks.\n\nEven in Silicon Valley, where financiers don't often let pesky business metrics such as revenue and profit damp their enthusiasm for a startup, Pinterest's new financing round seemed like a reach.\n\nSo why the eye-popping numbers? A pessimist would say more big money finding its way to tech startups is a sure sign of an investment bubble, because Pinterest is hardly the only young company landing huge investments.\n\nEarlier this year, Fab, a designer e-commerce site that hasn't made a profit, increased its valuation to US$1 billion by taking a US$150 million investment from the Chinese Internet conglomerate Tencent Holdings. This month, Alibaba Group Holding, a Chinese e-commerce company, led a US$206 million investment in ShopRunner, which offers unlimited two-day shipping from retailers, that valued the company at US$600 million.\n\nOn Friday, AllThingsD reported that Snapchat, the messaging app based in Los Angeles, which also lacks revenue, is weighing a \"huge\" investment round that would value the company at US$3.5 billion.\n\nAt the very least, that's a frothy list that argues that enthusiasm is once again getting ahead of reality in the tech industry.\n\nThe Pinterest investment is also an opportunity to see how big, outside money is added to the mix in Silicon Valley. While the latest Pinterest round included Valley heavyweights such as venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, the bulk of the money came from Fidelity Investments, the mutual fund giant in Boston. And Fidelity plays by different rules than the typical tech investor.\n\nCash-rich financial outfits such as Fidelity, which has more than US$1.7 trillion in managed assets, are not as worried about hitting the home run ball as typical tech investors. Double your money when you invest US$200 million? That's fine for Fidelity. And if the investment doesn't work out, it's still chump change for a company that large.\n\nThat would never do for venture capitalist firms. First, they can't throw around that kind of money. Second, those firms typically promise their own backers a return of 10 times or more on the money they have put into a company.\n\nThey have to. Many of the companies they put money into never pan out, and they're always looking for the next Facebook or Google to make up for the numerous bad bets.\n\nVenture capital is a high-risk business. As risky as throwing US$200 million at a company with no revenue? It'll be a while before we know the answer on that one.\n\nLikewise, when foreign financiers put money into startups, they also don't look for huge returns. Following the lead of Yuri Milner's investment company, which put money into companies such as Facebook and Twitter, they also have more modest goals: turn a profit, improve their cachet among the startup community and - as is often the case - learn from the companies in which they are investing.\n\n\"It depends on the glasses you're wearing whether these investments are too high,\" said Mark Leslie, a managing partner at his own venture firm, Leslie Ventures, and a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.\n\nFidelity declined to comment on its investment. Pinterest said it was using the money to invest in the core of the company and international expansion but would not discuss the valuation. Now, the idea of Silicon Valley's investment community - which brought you Pets.com and other website wonders - wagging fingers and noting that others are driving irrational valuations might strike some people as, well, funny. Or sour grapes.\n\nBut startups court risk when they court investments at such generous valuations. As I've written before, once a startup reaches a US$1 billion valuation, the number of big companies capable of acquiring it is more limited.\n\nIt can be difficult to say for certain how much a young company should or should not be worth. Private investors may gamble that a fast-growing startup with no obvious revenue may figure out, as Google did, how to pair a smart business model with millions of users.\n\nThat said, it can be hard to figure out how these valuations add up. Take Square, the mobile payments startup best known for its slick credit card reader. Last year, it raised a reported US$200 million from investors that valued the company at US$3.25 billion.\n\nSquare is expected to process US$15 billion in transactions in 2013. Compare that to MasterCard, which processes more than US$3.6 trillion in credit card transactions annually. MasterCard is valued at US$90 billion on the public market. If the market were applying valuations based on transaction volume alone, MasterCard would be valued at almost US$800 billion.\n\nNot surprisingly, \"unlike Square's previous financing rounds, which prominently featured big venture capital names such as Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers\", its most recent round was not led by a traditional Silicon Valley backer, The New York Times reported at the time. Instead, the majority of the financing came from Suhail Rizvi, head of Rizvi Traverse Management, a private equity group. Rizvi Traverse and Square both declined to comment about the company's financing.\n\nDoes Mr Rizvi, who is also among Twitter's biggest investors, have a greater appetite for risk than tech's usual financiers? Perhaps. Or maybe, as Mr Leslie put it, he's looking at his investment with a different set of glasses. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom: survey\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/7b63515fb11c0f305f580321b09329fe59c39aba8f41af9e08b80018b28ab508?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Huge investment: Three-year-old Pinterest doesn't have any revenue yet.

It is part of a group developing an iconic 72-storey condominium tower next to the landmark Museum of Modern Art with a development cost of more than US$1.3 billion.\n\nIt says that it is keen on further investments in the United States and also has its eye on China and Europe - in a move seen by analysts as branching out of Singapore to escape the government's moves to cool the local property market.\n\nPontiac, set up in Singapore in 1961 by the Kwee family from Indonesia, is partnering Goldman Sachs Real Estate Principal Investment Area and Houston-based property group Hines, to develop a freehold project named after its location at 53 West 53rd Street, of 145 luxury residences that will be launched for sale from next year.\n\nBesides its US$200 million equity investment, Pontiac is also giving Singapore banks a leg-up in their loan books, which have been hit by the total debt servicing ratio framework. The company has secured US$860 million of construction financing from a consortium comprising DBS Bank, OCBC Bank, United Overseas Bank and Malaysia's Maybank.\n\nWork on the 1,050-foot high iconic project, designed by Pritzker Prize Laureate Jean Nouvel, is expected to begin in mid-2014 and its first residents are expected to move in from late-2018. The development will have 750,000-sq-ft gross floor area, including a 36,000-sq-ft expansion of MoMA's galleries on the museum's second, fourth and fifth floors.\n\nPontiac did not reveal unit sizes and pricing. The Wall Street Journal noted that two other midtown Manhattan residential buildings that will rise more than 1,000 feet, One57 and 432 Park, already have contracts for top-level apartments at more than US$90 million.\n\nBesides boasting breathtaking New York City and Central Park views, the tower will include a fitness facility with a 75-foot lap pool.\n\nFor Pontiac, its participation in the project reflects a step \"outside its comfort zone\" in Singapore, said its CEO, Michael Su. \"We believe in the resilience and potential of the New York property market, and intend to further develop our capabilities in the US, taking a long-term strategic view. And if opportunities present themselves in China and Europe, we will not rule out these markets.\"\n\nAsked if the group is diversifying out of Singapore due to various property cooling measures imposed by the authorities here, Mr Su said: \"Singapore remains our core market, but when the opportunity to work with Hines and Goldman Sachs on this project arose, we knew that we wanted to be a part of this landmark development. We love prime location and luxury assets associated with arts and culture.\"\n\nPontiac, controlled by the four Kwee brothers - all Singapore citizens - is an avid supporter of the arts. Each of its Singapore developments including Millenia Tower, Camden Medical Centre, Colonnade and Ardmore Residence are adorned with museum-quality art pieces.\n\n\"For this reason, we're delighted to have the chance to collaborate with MoMA, one of the world's top museums,\" Mr Su said.\n\nHines and Goldman Sachs acquired the 18,000 sq ft site, located between 53rd and 54th streets just west of MoMA, for US$125 million from the museum in 2007.\n\nMeanwhile, in Jakarta's CBD, GIC Real Estate is acquiring a 47-storey, 974,251-square-foot international Grade A office tower in a mixed-use project by Greenland Rajawali Utama in a deal earlier reported to be around US$350 million. The Indonesian company is majority controlled by Rajawali Group and its property subsidiary.\n\nThe property, along Jalan Gatot Subroto, is slated for completion in late 2015. Jones Lang LaSalle is said to be involved in the deal, which has been approved by the Indonesia Investment Cordinating Board.\n\nDesigned to international standards, the office tower will have efficient floor-plates and will be certified Green Mark GoldPlus by Singapore's Building and Construction Authority. Leasing will begin soon.\n\nThe Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects-designed project will include a St Regis hotel - the first all-suite hotel in Jakarta - and a retail podium for specialist F&B outlets.\n\nGIC Real Estate has been investing in Indonesia since 1990s. \"Demand for high-quality office space in the Jakarta CBD offers significant growth opportunities . . . GIC, as a long-term investor, is in a good position to seize these opportunities together with more like-minded partners,\" said its co-head of Asia, Lee Kok Sun.\n\nRajawali Property Group acting CEO Shirley Tan said: \"We believe this is a first step towards a strategic partnership with GIC based on a long-term positive view of Indonesia's real estate market.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/transport-logistics/ryanair-changes-image-demand-weakens", "site_title": "Ryanair changes image as demand weakens", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nRyanair changes image as demand weakens\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Oct 29, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[LONDON] Charging 60 euros for carry-on bags deemed too large to go in the cabin. Assessing a penalty of 70 euros for not checking in online. Bombarding passengers who take a 615 am plane with in-flight announcements hawking everything from snacks to lottery tickets to smokeless cigarettes.\n\nMichael O'Leary, the chief executive of the budget airline Ryanair, has vowed to address the criticisms that have made his carrier, Europe's biggest and most profitable, its most reviled.\n\nIt is a change of heart motivated mainly by pragmatism. Even as Ryanair has added new routes every few months, Europe's weak economy has taken its toll. Simply put, the company can no longer afford to risk losing customers who would rather pay more to fly on another carrier than endure Ryanair's cattle-car approach.\n\nThe shift in tone may not come easily for Mr O'Leary, a 52-year-old Irishman and famously pugnacious former accountant who has led the airline for nearly 20 years.\n\nHe is perhaps best known for past proposals like onboard pay toilets, or standing-room \"seats\" at the back of the airline's Boeing 737s, or charging higher fares to \"fat people\" - suggestions that never came to fruition but seemed carefully calibrated to offend.\n\nBut for all the detractors, it would be hard for anyone to dispute Ryanair's explosive growth. The airline, founded in 1985 by Irish billionaire Tony Ryan, has grown from flying 80,000 passengers a year on a single route - Dublin to London - to shuttling roughly 80 million annually among 180 destinations, on a network that extends from Estonia to the Canary Islands.\n\nThat puts Ryanair well ahead of Europe's next-largest airline by number of passengers, Lufthansa, which last year transported just over 64 million people.\n\nYet as Europe's economic slump grinds on, even Ryanair is starting to feel the pinch of weakening travel demand. Simply promising low fares and punctual flights - the airline has a good record on both measures - is not enough.\n\nLast month the airline warned investors that net profit for its current financial year could fall below last year's record 560 million euros (S$955.6 million). That would be the Ryanair's first earnings decline in a decade.\n\nAnd so, many analysts say, Mr O'Leary must find ways to transform its brand to appeal to the millions of travellers who consciously avoid Ryanair.\n\nSaid Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst for Hudson Crossing, a consulting firm: \"As the low-cost market matures in Europe, Michael O'Leary realises that Ryanair has to think of ways to make customers prefer the airline.\"\n\nRyanair's new charm offensive includes giving airport staff and cabin crew more discretion in dealing with common issues like oversize carry-on luggage. It also plans, in coming months, to reduce the fees it charges to check a bag, among other reductions. And planes departing before 8 am will now be designated \"quiet flight\" without those blaring sales pitches.\n\nBut the main thrust of the plan is digital. Elements include a redesign of its deliberately cumbersome website, which was designed to thwart online ticket resellers. The smartphone app is now free, instead of costing three euros to download. And there is the embrace of Twitter.\n\n\"I've been incredibly, I suppose, dismissive of social media for the last four or five years,\" Mr O'Leary conceded. \"I think so much time is wasted by so many people exchanging inanities on social websites. Yet, I am now persuaded in recent weeks and months that actually, use of sites like Twitter is a very good way to disseminate our message.\"\n\nRyanair's efforts also come as the airline finds itself struggling to find new sources of revenue.

Their story unfolds in flashback, told from Raymond's point of view after he returns home from Debbie's funeral.\n\nShe died at age 36 in 1992 but by any standard, her father's rise from a near-penniless youth in Liverpool to the \"King of Soho\" (the intended title of the movie until a legal dispute scuppered those plans) and at one time the richest man in the UK makes for a remarkable (and yes, titillating) tale.\n\nConsidering the subject matter and despite the copious amounts of naked flesh on display, The Look of Love comes across as more of a contemplative piece than an exploitation vehicle.\n\nRaymond (Steve Coogan) was a maverick who astutely took advantage of the country's declining moral values and the potential for property values in central London to rise. By the early-1970s, that combination had made him enormously wealthy and eager to flaunt it in the shape of fur coats, Rolls Royces and luxury homes - all decorated in suitably vulgar taste, of course.\n\nFancy homes are mere empty possessions though and Raymond's most notable accessories were the young women who were happy to shed their clothes and share the spotlight with him - in bed, on stage and in the tabloids.\n\nThe film distils the women in his life down to three main characters: long-suffering wife Jean (Anna Friel), Amber St George (Tamsin Egerton), the long-legged showgirl who morphed into Fiona Richmond, sex columnist for Raymond's soft porn mag Men Only, and Debbie (Imogen Poots), the sweet little daddy's girl who tried too hard to be like daddy.\n\nRaymond lived a male fantasy but money, sex and drugs only took him so far.\n\nThe Look of Love has great production values and dishes the dirt on Raymond's unique life but the episodic format feels uncomfortably disjointed and fails to fully deliver on what could have been a more powerful cautionary tale.\n\n\"I just want to lead a normal life,\" says Amber at a low point in their relationship. \"Normal life is for normal people,\" replies Raymond, a man who disdained normalcy - and paid a huge price for the privilege.\n\nRating:\n\nC+\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The former is a 99-year leasehold (expires in March 2088) commercial, retail and hotel development, while the latter is a freehold outlet shopping centre.\n\n\"Far East Organization views Australia as an attractive property investment market driven by a stable economy and well-regulated business environment. The acquisition of Clocktower Square in Sydney and Harbour Town Centre in Perth reinforces the organisation's strategy to build a more balanced asset portfolio beyond Singapore and Malaysia.\n\n\"The move opens new opportunities for the organisation to expand its development and management expertise in Australia, and demonstrates a strong commitment to the market,\" said Far East.\n\nLocated in Sydney's Central Business District, the Clocktower Square complex is a mixed-use development comprising a two-level retail shopping centre, a six-storey commercial office tower and a 61-room boutique hotel called Rendezvous Stafford Hotel.\n\nIt sits on a 38,739 square foot site and is close to major public transport nodes, retail and dining destinations, as well as some of Sydney's most premium-grade office towers, said Far East.\n\n\"It has sound building fundamentals and a history of strong occupation and quality tenancy,\" it added.\n\nHarbour Town Centre is a two-storey outlet shopping mall occupying a 213,567 sq ft plot along Wellington Street, one kilometre west of the Perth Central Business District (CBD). Described by Far East as \"a highly successful outlet shopping centre\", it is home to 120 retailers.\n\nThe Harbour Town Centre transaction is expected to be completed in November, and the Clocktower Square deal in December.\n\nFar East's acquisition of the two developments comes after the joint-venture company between its listed arm, Far East Orchard, and The Straits Trading Company completed its 50:50 joint venture with Australia-based Toga Group earlier in August.\n\nFar East Orchard is also working with Straits Trading to acquire hotel sites in Australia on an ongoing basis and to conduct hospitality management businesses.\n\nFar East also owns a 1.5 million sq ft site in Melbourne's St Helena-Greensborough. Plans are afoot to develop the site into an integrated residential community.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Noble declined to comment.\n\nThe deal would give Yanzhou more control over a key coal asset at a time when its market value has slumped in line with falling coal prices. But it is expected to face stiff opposition from local regulators as it appears to run counter to previous requirements that Yancoal be run as an Australian company.\n\nThe government would have to waive key conditions imposed on Yanzhou when it took over Felix Resources in 2009 for A$3.5 billion and when Yancoal merged with Gloucester Coal last year.\n\nSources declined to comment on the status of Yanzhou's talks with the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), which must make a recommendation to Australia's new treasurer, Joe Hockey.\n\nFIRB conditions required Yanzhou to list its Australian assets, which it did last year through the Gloucester merger, to reduce its 78 per cent stake in Yancoal Australia to less than 70 per cent and to cut its economic stake in the underlying Felix assets to no more than 50 per cent by the end of 2013.\n\nYancoal's shares rose 1.4 per cent yesterday to A$0.72, trading well below the value of the offer as uncertainty weighs on whether a deal will go ahead. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nZuckerberg says Meta will invest hundreds of billions in superintelligence\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:48 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLinkedIn settles antitrust lawsuit, agrees to contracting changes\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:12 PM\n\nUS: Wall Street opens mixed as investors digest fresh tariff threats\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:43 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nBRC Asia secures contracts for Changi Airport Terminal 5 project worth S$570 million\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:04 PM", "images": []}

When Petra announced in July that the sale was completed on June 30, the estimated sale proceeds was already cut to US$860 million because working capital delivered at completion was lower by about US$74 million.\n\nShould Petra be compelled to accept the closing price reduction, it would mean a chunky 20 per cent slice off the original offer price when the deal was struck in December last year. The sale emerged from several unsolicited offers to Petra Foods, and Barry Callebaut's offer was said to have been the most attractive.\n\nThe price reduction now being sought could also mean that Petra's last announced initial net proceeds of US$164 million from the last agreed price of US$860 million and the net estimated gain on divestment of US$64 million could be whittled down to just US$66 million in net proceeds and a significant estimated net loss on divestment of US$34.3 million on our estimate.\n\nThis could mean a potential estimated net loss per share of 6 US cents (about 7 Singapore cents) from the sale transaction, instead of the net gain per share of 10 US cents(about 13 Singapore cents). This estimated shortfall of 20 Singapore cents could prompt analysts to further knock down their average stock price target of S$4.20.\n\nIn its short announcement on the closing price adjustment on Oct 21, Petra stated its position that the US$98.3 million sought by Barry Callebaut was unjustified and not compliant with the sale and purchase agreement (SPA) and the law. Petra said that while the SPA had provided for a mechanism and process to seek a closing price adjustment if necessary and justified, the \"draft completion statement\" from Barry Callebaut on Sept 23, which sought the price reduction, was not compliant with the SPA and the law.\n\nTherefore \"since Barry Callebaut had refused to make it compliant, it is now out of time to issue any draft Completion Statement or to seek any closing price reduction\". \"The company also considers that the price adjustments sought by Barry Callebaut do not have a proper or valid basis and/or have not been properly substantiated or justified\".\n\nOn its part, the Zurich-based and listed cocoa group has stated that it had submitted the completion statement in accordance with the SPA. The Swiss company said the two parties will now apply the dispute resolution mechanism as foreseen in the SPA. However, it assured its investors that the dispute would not affect the operational performance of the group or the integration of its recently acquired cocoa business.\n\nFor Petra Foods' shareholders, some key questions remain unanswered, the first being what will be the potential impact on group earnings and performance should the buyer secure its closing price adjustment; the second being what are the adjustments being claimed by the buyer; and thirdly why was the buyer's draft completion statement non-compliant and fourth, and equally important, what is the dispute resolution mechanism?\n\nIn its interim results presentation on Aug 14, management highlighted that the group had already booked an exceptional gain of US$77.2 million from the divestment, but also made a US$72.5 million inventory write-off and write-down from the divested business. The strong performance from its branded consumer business notwithstanding, the group posted a 1HFY13 net loss of US$10.1 million.\n\nIt was in the late 1980s that the group ventured into the cocoa ingredients business with its first cocoa-processing plant in the Philippines, followed by Thailand in 1989 and then the acquisition of processing plants in Mexico, Brazil and Europe in 2003. By 2010, Petra had grown to claim the position as the largest cocoa bean grinder in Asia and the fourth largest in the world after ADM, Cargill and Barry Callebaut, providing cocoa ingredients to customers such as Nestle, Cadbury and Mars in over 60 countries.\n\nThe company decided to divest its cocoa segment after considering: the significant investments needed to continue to grow the business further; the timing of the sale given the competitive offers being received; and the need to focus on and grow their existing branded consumer division. The sale comprised the group's entire cocoa ingredients business, including seven factories in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Brazil, Mexico, Germany and France and major sales offices in Singapore, the Netherlands and USA.\n\nAccording to its 1H13 results presentation on Aug 14, the group has already received sale proceeds of US$679 million on July 1, after adjusting for estimated net debt of US$181 million assumed by Barry Callebaut. In fact, management at that point had said that the group would reinvest the net proceeds in its branded consumer division, as well as, consider a distribution to shareholders.\n\nWith Halloween just round the corner, one can hardly blame Petra's shareholders if they wonder if the cocoa ingredients divestment could disguise a more tricky outcome instead of the sweet treat that it could have been.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Neither F&N nor FCL will receive cash proceeds due to the introductory nature of FCL's listing.\n\nDBS Bank is the sole issue manager for the distribution, and is also advising F&N together with Morgan Stanley Asia (Singapore) and United Overseas Bank.\n\nShould the proposed \"de-merger\" go through, F&N will have a clean break from the property business, and no longer hold any stake in FCL.\n\nThe conglomerate intends to concentrate on growing its food and beverage (F&B) business and strengthening its position as a leading consumer group in South-east Asia, where it sees \"tremendous untapped potential\".\n\nWith total assets of about $10.5 billion as at end- June, FCL is set to become one of the biggest property plays on SGX by market capitalisation after it lists. It will compare with other property counters such as CapitaLand and City Developments, which have market caps of $13.3 billion and $9.5 billion respectively as at last Friday's closing.\n\nLim Ee Seng, group CEO of FCL, said: \"This proposed listing will enhance FCL's profile as an independently-listed company\".\n\nFCL's portfolio comprises residential, commercial and hospitality assets, and it was among the top three sellers of private residential homes last year, according to a DTZ report. It also sponsors two real estate investment trusts listed on the mainboard: Frasers Centrepoint Trust and Frasers Commercial Trust.\n\nF&N will call an extraordinary general meeting to seek shareholder approval for the distribution in specie of all issued shares in FCL.\n\nTCC Assets, which holds 61.7 per cent of F&N shares, reiterated yesterday that it plans to support the move.\n\nTCC Assets is controlled by Thai tycoon Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi, who completed his takeover of F&N in February. He had built more than a 90 per cent stake in F&N through TCC Assets and mainboard-listed Thai Beverage Public Co (ThaiBev).\n\nAnalysts had been largely sanguine about F&N's plans to walk away from property, which were first announced in late August, as the business may not have fitted well in F&B focused ThaiBev.\n\nF&N shares closed 0.5 per cent higher on Friday at $5.68. ThaiBev fell 1.8 per cent to 54 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth/wealth-investing/gold-now-buy-and-trade-asset-credit-agricole-exec", "site_title": "Gold is now 'buy-and-trade asset': Credit Agricole exec", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nGold is now 'buy-and-trade asset': Credit Agricole exec\n\nHe adds that gold supply and demand are currently in a tight balance\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Oct 22, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nGOLD is no longer a buy-and-hold asset, says Credit Agricole Private Banking Group global head of FX and precious metals Davis Hall.\n\nInstead, it is an \"opportunistic buy-and-trade asset\", he says. Mr Hall expects gold to trade between US$1,100 and US$1,400 an ounce over the next few months. His call is to buy gold on weakness.\n\nHe is also telling private clients to consider palladium, which has appreciated strongly over the past 10 years from US$200 an ounce to US$800, albeit at a relatively slower pace than gold. Yet it hasn't suffered through gold's recent correction, possibly because its price is underpinned by industrial use. \"We think it will outperform gold, although it's hard to establish interest among private clients in palladium.\"\n\nGold spot price touched a low of US$1,203 in June. Over the past 12 months, gold has fallen nearly 25 per cent from a high of US$1,747 last November 2012 to US$1,312 as at yesterday.\n\nMr Hall says that gold supply and demand are currently in a tight balance. Buying by central banks is also a supportive factor. \"Gold is still suffering. It's very much out of favour and bearish psychology persist.But the supply/demand factors are quite supportive because the World Gold Council has come out to say that the average all-in sustainable extraction cost for gold is close to US$1,200, which means that about 15 per cent of producers operate at a loss at below US$1,300.\n\n\"We think production has started to peak, as margins get squeezed and energy costs make extraction more expensive. But central banks continue to buy.\"\n\nThere are a number of dampeners. Gold exchange traded funds (ETFs), for one, have liquidated some 22 million ounces since January, or 27 per cent of holdings. The velocity of sales, however, may have bottomed.\n\nAnother dampener has been India, traditionally a strong gold consumer. India has raised its tax on gold imports three times this year in an effort to curb demand and reduce its trade deficit. The latest hike comes just as the year-end peak buying season for gold traditionally begins, thanks to weddings and festivals.\n\nSays Mr Hall: \"India has come up with very confusing 20/80 import ratio regulation where 20 per cent of imports has to be re-exported and the paperwork has confused bullion buyers. India, the number one buying community, imported 950 tonnes in 2009, although they brought in just five tonnes in August this year, the lowest in a decade. The regulations have really started to change investor appetite. As long as they are not changed, India will buy less than before.\"\n\nHe says: \"I think gold will trade at US$1,100 to US$1,400, and I'm a buyer on weakness because the market is pessimistic and a lot of liquidation has already occurred. And we might see mining companies reduce production. One forgets that in history, all the gold ever mined fills only two Olympic-sized swimming pools. I still believe gold is an asset to have in portfolios.\"\n\nMeanwhile, he believes that the US dollar will strengthen possibly next year, particularly if bond yields begin to climb. Nominee for Federal Reserve Board chairman Janet Yellen, who is still to be confirmed, is widely perceived to be inclined to maintain stimulus at current levels.\n\n\"We may have another 100 days before anyone thinks she will reduce (stimulus). But eventually she will reduce because unemployment will drift back below 7 per cent. This is where the bond market may punish the Fed. I'm a little worried that in the absence of inflation the bond market will say the Fed is behind the curve.\" Ten-year yields moving up to 3 or 3.3 per cent \"will create the prerequisite for a dollar rally\", he says.\n\nA number of other developments bode well for the US dollar. One is the shale gas revolution which creates the possibility of energy self sufficiency for the US within five to seven years. \"That may be priced into US stocks but it's not priced into the deficit.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But to understand the short and long-term effects of its government's recent brush with financial Armageddon, it is important to realise that more was at stake than a good payment record.\n\nConfidence in America derives not just from its sustained economic growth over the past century, but also from its ability to reconcile the nation's diverse political views.\n\nThis is now in jeopardy.\n\nThe US has always been a nation that has set a standard. Its emergence in the 20th century as the bearer of the world's reserve currency is based on the faith of global markets in the underpinning of its economic system by democratic principles and ability to overcome its differences.\n\nBased on conversations with leaders in business and government in the US and beyond, I can tell you this faith was badly shaken during the 16 days of the government shutdown and the high-stakes poker over a debt-limit extension. While we can all breathe easier because the government is still making good on its obligations, it would be wrong to think that it avoided doing real and potentially lasting damage to the economy at home and worldwide.\n\nThe weeks of political turmoil have already slowed growth, taking an estimated US$24 billion out of the economy. This is particularly unfortunate at a time when economic fundamentals have been strengthening and the US recovery is picking up steam. The housing market has been gaining momentum, corporate profits have been strong and America has been gearing up for a manufacturing renaissance, thanks to lower energy costs delivered by new technologies such as fracking.\n\nBut the market environment is still challenging. Uncertainty is high and political wrangling is pushing fundamentals to the backburner. One cannot overestimate the impact of this on confidence at a time when business leaders should be making decisions that drive growth. It has put the US economy in a holding pattern that, if it persists, could lead to a global slowdown.\n\nScores of chief executives have told me they have been putting off investment in factories and equipment and delaying hiring decisions while they wait to see how events unfold in Washington.\n\nMore troubling still, the trepidation has spilled over to the bond market. Many foreign investors are rethinking their approach to investing in US debt. Even a marginal change in the willingness of governments, pension funds, insurance companies and other institutions around the world to buy America's bonds will incrementally raise interest rates and drive up the costs of financing our deficits.\n\nThis will not only worsen the fiscal situation at federal, state and local levels; it will also mean higher borrowing costs for anyone buying a house or other big-ticket items.\n\nThe end result: slower growth.\n\nThis in turn will push the US Federal Reserve to again delay the tapering of its bond-buying programme. So the rates will stay low in the short term, but further distort financial markets and delay the restoration of sustainable monetary policy.\n\nAnd because the dollar will for now remain the world's reserve currency, there will be greater risk premiums for all borrowers. The repercussions will be felt not only in the US markets and economy but across the globe, especially in the developing world, which already pays an even higher risk premium for borrowing.\n\nStill, I remain an optimist. If US politicians show themselves ready - and able - to take a bipartisan approach that avoids another debt-ceiling showdown and to address our long-term deficit issues, the US can minimise the lasting damage to the economy and restore its reputation as a principled nation committed to meeting its obligations.\n\nAbove all, the next round of budget discussions needs to show that the US political system still works.\n\nBut if the country heads into 2014 beating war drums in Washington and reviving the narrative of a potential default, overseas buyers of Treasuries are highly likely to move quicker to diversify their holdings, with all the global consequences that entails.\n\nAll members of Congress, conservative and progressive alike, must remember that the US is a debtor nation, dependent on international investors who own more than US$5 trillion or about half of publicly held federal bonds. It is why the budget battles have global ramifications.\n\nThe short-term damage has been done; the next round of budget discussions needs to show that the American political system still works. If US leaders can return to the standards of good faith, civil deliberation and mutual respect that have always provided the foundation of the country's global economic leadership, they can restore the confidence of all Americans, as well as business leaders, investors and markets worldwide - and with that, the potential for a long-term US economic resurgence.\n\nThe writer is chairman and chief executive officer of BlackRock, a New York City-based multinational investment management corporation\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But it may not be all bad news where the bottom line is concerned, especially as the airline aggressively grows its network in the buoyant Asia-Pacific market.\n\nIn 2004, SIA first started operating the near-19 hour service to New York, which covers over 15,300km, using the long-range, four-engine Airbus A340-500 aircraft. After initially starting out with a mix of business and premium economy seats, it later converted the flight to an all-Business Class configuration with 100 seats.\n\nSIA also used to operate the world's second-longest flight, an all-Business Class direct service between Singapore and Los Angeles, which saw its last flight take off earlier this month on Oct 20. The last direct Singapore-Newark flight departs on Nov 23.\n\nAirbus is due to acquire SIA's five A340s as part of a deal inked last year where the airline ordered more A380s and A350s.\n\n\"Retiring our A340-500s and removing them from service is in line with Singapore Airlines' long-standing policy of maintaining a young and modern fleet,\" said an SIA spokesman, adding that high and volatile fuel prices posed challenges for ultra-long haul operations.\n\nThe airline, which bumped up services to Houston from five times weekly to daily between May and August this year, continues to explore other avenues to enhance its US services.\n\n\"Following the financial crisis, the world has changed. Demand for air travel has also changed,\" said UOB Kay Hian's aviation analyst K Ajith.\n\nSuch long-range flights are \"nearly impossible\" to operate profitably at current fuel prices, Brendan Sobie, chief analyst for CAPA - Centre for Aviation, wrote in a recent report. The ultra-long range flight is fuel-intensive and with just 100 seats - even premium seats - the yields may not justify the operating costs. According to the International Air Transport Association (Iata), the average fuel bill for this year is hovering at US$124.50 per barrel.\n\nWhile SIA still operates flights to these two cities through its existing one-stop flights to LA (via Tokyo) and New York (via Frankfurt) - for which prices are typically lower than the non-stop services - it tacks on extra time for a flight aimed at the corporate sector. For instance, the airline's existing service to New York's John F Kennedy International Airport (via Frankfurt) means some four hours of additional flight time compared to its direct service to Newark.\n\nSIA will also now be competing head-on with a number of other carriers that also offer a one-stop service. These include Cathay Pacific, Emirates, British Airways (BA) and Delta Air Lines, each flying via their own individual hubs and sometimes with lower fare offerings.\n\nTo open up more premium seats, SIA had said previously that it would swop its 471-seat A380 with 60 Business Class seats, currently deployed on the two routes, with its 409-seater A380 offering 86 Business Class seats.\n\nStill, there is bound to be a spillover to other carriers.\n\nMr Sobie expects that SIA will likely lose \"at least half\" of the passengers that were travelling on its non-stop US flights, given that there are 12 other carriers offering one-stop services from Singapore to LA and 20 other airlines that do so to New York. He estimates that suspending the non-stop flights to LA and Newark will cause SIA's total capacity in the US market to drop by about 16 per cent to 22,000 seats weekly, which means it will also slide down the ranks from the fifth largest Asian carrier operating to the US to the ninth. SIA's number of premium seats in the market, however, will drop by a sharper 26 per cent.\n\nDelta, which has overhauled its business class product for its trans-Pacific routes, has made no secret of its intentions to grow its market share when SIA suspends its non-stop services to the US.\n\nFor BA, all this opens up a huge opportunity to snag a bigger piece of the Singapore-New York route pie, said Robert Williams, regional general manager (South-east Asia). The airline operates two flights a day from Singapore to London, and then 12 flights a day onto New York as well as three times a day to LA out of London. At London's Heathrow Airport, BA's flights operate out of Terminal 5, which means seamless connectivity without having to switch terminals, as well as access to its lounges.\n\nWith Singapore, London and New York being key financial hubs, passengers also have the flexibility of stopping in London for meetings, Mr Williams pointed out, adding that premium fares compared to SIA are at \"similar levels, if not just a bit under\". BA's business class fare to New York goes at around $10,370.\n\nThe Middle Eastern carriers are also likely to benefit, using their hubs in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Doha for onward connections to the US.\n\nWhile Mr Ajith acknowledged that there could be some migration to other airlines, he doesn't expect the suspension of these direct services to have a significant impact on SIA's financial performance.\n\n\"Collectively, it will probably be better for SIA,\" he said, adding that the airline would have kept it if it was profitable. \"SIA would have probably seen that the loads on the (NY) route were less than optimal and chose to cut the flights.\"\n\nMeanwhile, SIA has been growing its capacity within the Asia-Pacific, especially in countries such as Indonesia and India, the latter being a market where it is now setting up a full service carrier with India's Tata.\n\n\"The decision to cut the non-stop flights to the US will see it lose a share of the US-South-east Asia market. But then, this is no longer a strategically critical market for SIA. And it is a market that has become very competitive,\" Mr Sobie pointed out, stressing that SIA might do better to focus on growing in markets closer to home.\n\nShares in SIA closed at $10.48 on Friday, up three cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That same year, a group of senior ministers from five South-east Asian nations gathered in Bangkok to form what we know today as Asean, the Association of South-east Asian Nations.\n\nAsean states were then more concerned with the political turmoil, which was blighting the region, than a pie-in-the-sky notion of regional economic growth. An ongoing war against communism in Indochina, racial and sectarian issues across the Malay archipelago and political instability in some of the world's poorest countries meant South-east Asia was not a region where one would expect to see a great deal of economic integration.\n\nTo the north, China was then a large but closed country with few economic links to the outside world and undergoing the painful upheaval of the Cultural Revolution.\n\nFast forward four decades and it is hard to imagine a more different scenario. Asean represents 10 countries from across the region with all their economic, political and demographic diversity. While some of its developing member states such as Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos are some of the world's poorest nations, Asean remains a source for economic optimism amid wider concerns about the state of the global economy.\n\nSingapore's place in Asean\n\nSingapore, one of Asean's five founding member states, is key to the region's dynamism. While it is one of the smallest member states in terms of land-size and population, its status as one of the world's key financial and transportation hubs positions it as an integral piece in the future development of the region.\n\nCapital market activity in South-east Asia has remained robust, with many new listings in the emerging markets of Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, defying a general lull in global market activity.\n\nThe increasing volumes and market sophistication in the primary exchanges of these countries has enabled local companies, many of them government-linked enterprises, to raise capital through equity markets.\n\nSingapore, by far the most mature and developed financial centre, remains a major hosting venue for many companies with operations in or with major earnings derived out of South-east Asian markets.\n\nSome 52 companies listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) with a market capitalisation of more than S$500 million report revenues derived either from Asean markets other than Singapore, or consolidated as part of South-east Asian revenues. More than half have generated gains in the year to date when taking into account both price appreciation and dividends.\n\nTwelve of these shares, including Thai Beverage, Jardine Strategic Holdings, Jardine Matheson Holdings and Wilmar International, are constituents of the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI).\n\nBroad range\n\nSGX-listed Asean stocks span a broad range of sectors and industries, though there is a heavy focus on food, oil and gas, telcos and utilities.\n\nCompanies with exposure to Asean markets outside of Singapore have exposure to the growth swings of these developing economies. Rising incomes, growing consumption and the economic advancement of these countries offer scope for greater revenues.\n\nHowever, companies with such earnings profiles also face more political, currency and economic risks operating in these markets than they would in developed markets such as Singapore.\n\nSingapore's three domestic banks are also invested in the markets of neighbouring Asean countries. However, financial services across the region are generally fragmented, with domestic issues shaping how they are expanding within the region.\n\nSingapore banks' recent expansion into these markets has focused on growing middle-class borrowing as well as the emergence of mass affluent and private wealth segments in these countries.\n\nUnited Overseas Bank (UOB) has the greatest exposure to Asean markets ex-Singapore. OCBC Bank has the second largest exposure, followed by DBS Group Holdings.\n\nEconomic integration\n\nThe scope for much greater integration across Asean economies is huge. The combined gross domestic product (GDP) of Asean member states last year was US$2.3 trillion, 25 per cent larger than the GDP of India.\n\nAsean leaders are seeking to establish the Asean Economic Community (AEC) by 2015. Among other things, the AEC seeks to remove trade barriers between Asean member states, harmonise national monopoly policies to foster greater regional competition and create greater linkages between Asean countries and the rest of the world.\n\nThere is therefore room for Asean financial markets and regional investment flows to deepen significantly. The FTSE Asean 40 Index is a stock index which includes constituents from five Asean markets (Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines) with a heavy focus on banks and telecommunications.\n\nThe index has generated a total return of 2.3 per cent this year (as at Oct 22). Investors can gain exposure to this index on SGX through the CIMB FTSE Asean 40 Index Exchange Traded Fund.\n\nAsean as an asset class\n\nIn its report released a fortnight ago, the International Monetary Fund forecasted that the economies of the entire Asean will grow 5.3 per cent next year, against 3.6 per cent for the global economy and 5.1 per cent for India.\n\nThe Asean member countries with the highest projected growth rates were Laos at 7.8 per cent and Cambodia at 7.2 per cent.\n\nSouth-east Asia as a region presents many opportunities for companies and investors - but challenges as well. While challenges and risks exist, economic and political stability has evolved to a point that the region is now considered one of the world's few economic bright spots, leading to an investable asset class in its own right.\n\nSingapore, as a stable and mature financial hub, is the best market for investors seeking exposure to the region.\n\nThe writer is SGX's market strategist\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These include being fully aware of all business operations and having sufficient controls to collect the appropriate information for disclosure needs, and being prepared to disclose material they are not used to disclosing.\n\n\"If they discover a problem that may violate US law, they have to be prepared to investigate the conduct, acknowledge it, and discipline wrongdoers,\" he said.\n\nMr Khuzami, a former federal prosecutor, joined the SEC in 2009 and was credited with revamping the agency in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. During his four-year stint, the SEC filed a high number of enforcement actions and created specialised units to investigate complex cases.\n\nHe was in Singapore yesterday together with fellow Kirkland partners Mark Filip and Sam Williamson, both also former government lawyers, to discuss compliance at an event organised by the American Chamber of Commerce in Singapore.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act in 2010 introduced thousands of pages of new laws and tens of thousands of pages of more specific regulations in many sectors of finance. Compliance costs are estimated to rise, even though many laws have yet to be written.\n\nMr Filip, a former deputy attorney general of the US, noted that a significant part of enforcement action revolves around corruption and bribery. To deal with US law in this area, companies need \"a strong tone from executives at the top, an informed legal and ethics department, and a reasonable and sincere investigation if you do an acquisition\", he said.\n\nFirms' audit departments have to look at high-risk areas and direct resources there, Mr Khuzami added. \"You can have hotlines so employees can report on corruption problems,\" he suggested.\n\nThe consequences of getting prosecuted for corruption can be severe. Mr Khuzami said the SEC filed 15 to 25 cases a year in the last few years in this area. The vast majority of cases were settled by the companies, which had to pay fines of anywhere from less than US$1 million to more than US$1 billion.\n\nAs for investigations into potentially fraudulent Chinese companies listed on US stock exchanges, Mr Khuzami said progress could be made now that Chinese authorities have agreed earlier this year to transfer audit papers to US regulators. China had been reluctant to turn over the documents because of state secrets and sovereignty concerns.\n\n\"We will see more transparency. This will lead to more initial public offerings in the US from Chinese companies, and more confidence in US capital markets,\" Mr Filip said.\n\nMr Khuzami also spoke about his experience in the SEC and having to deal with criticism that the agency did not do enough to punish Wall Street's role in the global financial crisis.\n\n\"I spent a good part of the last four years convincing a sceptical public that SEC was vigorously pursuing cases... It is a perfectly understandable anger due to the loss and pain and suffering caused,\" he said.\n\n\"We filed many cases. The SEC sued CEOs, CFOs, senior officers in (mortgage companies) Countrywide, New Century, IndyMac ... to some extent, the public wanted to see CEOs and senior executives of investment banks sued as well. But you can only bring cases where the evidence is there.\"\n\nUltimately, securities laws are based on disclosure and if such disclosure is accurate, there is no wrongdoing even if the investment tanks, he said. The financial crisis was not so much caused by fraud but more by a huge bet on the continued rise in housing prices, he added.\n\n\"We're in better shape now. But the question is if people will remember the lessons of the past.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Operations at its original Raffles Hotel branch will remain unaffected.\n\nAccording to chef Kanesaka's Singapore partner and the restaurant's managing director, Joni Ong, Shinji by Kanesaka's eight-seater sushi bar within the Tunglok Group's Tong Le Private Dining restaurant will most likely shut just before Chinese New Year. It will then resurface in St Regis in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nThe new Shinji by Kanesaka will take over a 1,360 sq ft space that was previously the hotel's Vintage Room and The Decanter bars. It will seat 16 along a main sushi counter, with a private sushi counter for eight.\n\nAn additional six-seater sake bar by the restaurant's entrance will showcase premium sakes as well as traditional Japanese tea-making ceremonies.\n\n\"Diners at Shinji often say that the best experience is at the counter. It is fun, interactive and people really enjoy sitting there,\" explains Ms Ong of the decision to move to a larger space. \"With only eight seats at OUE Tower, we've often had to turn away customers who wanted counter seats,\" she says.\n\nFurthermore, Shinji's three-year-old first outlet within the Raffles Hotel and its OUE outlet are in close proximity and currently target the same corporate crowd, while the new location at St Regis would better cater to residents in the Orchard, Tanglin and Bukit Timah neighbourhoods.\n\n\"We've always had customers asking why we don't have a presence at Orchard Road,\" Ms Ong adds. Still, she admits that the move was \"a difficult decision\".\n\nShe explains: \"We've enjoyed working with the Tunglok Group and we mulled for months over how to continue the partnership. But due to manpower constraints and in order to keep up our standards, we want to limit the number of Shinji restaurants in Singapore to two, hence our inability to continue operating at OUE Tower.\" Tong Le Private Dining will operate as usual beyond the move.\n\nPrices at Shinji at the St Regis will be similar to those at Raffles Hotel - sushi lunch sets start from $125 and omakase dinner sets from $300 - and Shinji's kitchen team at OUE Tower led by Japanese chef Kikuchi Shunsuke will be transferred to the St Regis branch.\n\nInterior-wise, expect Shinji's trademark sophisticated minimalism featuring organic wood panels and Hinoki wood counters flown in directly from Japan - but with a slight twist.\n\nChef Kanesaka's trusted designer, Junzo Irikado, has already seen and approved of the new space, Ms Ong says, and the team is \"waiting to be surprised by him\".\n\n\"We trust that he will come up with something quite unique while still retaining the traditional elements of an Edomae-style sushi restaurant.\n\n\"What we will not see is an exact replica of Shinji at Raffles Hotel,\" she states.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

International outlets in five! New restaurants open to pomp and pageantry, but very little is said when they go belly up just a year or two later. Debbie Yong looks into the recent string of restaurant closures for a change, and gets restaurant owners and chefs to open up about the pitfalls of running a restaurant, and whether the breakneck pace of restaurant launches is here to stay\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Oct 25, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nFORGET limited-edition sports cars, Centurion credit cards and sky-high condominiums with a private car lift. Judging by the rate of new restaurant openings per day in Singapore, it seems like the new Singapore Dream is to have a slick restaurant-bar to call one's own, so you can knock back cocktails with friends as you watch the crowds - and cash - roll in.\n\nEarlier this month, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam spotlighted Singapore's potential to tap on regional demand to become one of Asia's top culinary capitals and a \"distinctive destination\" for dining.\n\nAfter all, who in Singapore doesn't think and talk about food, oh, just about 24 hours a day? His call, it seems, is already being heeded. Recent statistics from the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority show that 686 restaurants were opened last year. The nett increase of 149 restaurants was double that of 2011.\n\nYet, beyond the pomp of glitzy restaurant openings or the prestige of namecards that bear the title \"restaurateur\", a harsher reality looms.\n\nThere are the less beckoning statistics that few pay attention to, such as the 537 restaurants that closed last year. Or the countless other unsuccessful eateries sold off from one failed restaurant owner to a still-optimistic successor. Or the telling flyers by now permanently tacked outside most F&B establishments, pleading for fresh hires.\n\nAt last count, at least 10 prominent restaurants have shut or will be shutting between June and December this year, with many more quietly folding up under the radar.\n\nPlaying on rougher terrain\n\nChefs and restaurant owners BT Weekend spoke to cite rental hikes and difficulty in hiring service staff as the chief reasons for restaurants to wind up. From July, the maximum proportion of foreigners permitted in a service firm has been capped at 40 per cent, down from 45 per cent before. Profiteering landlords, too, have been relentlessly upping rents, safe in the knowledge that beyond every exiting tenant lies several more deep-pocketed new entrepreneurs waiting with ready cheques at the door.\n\nOther causes for failure include poorly thought-out food concepts and shareholder disputes, while a further handful close due to circumstances beyond their control, such as a termination of their leases by the government or by private landlords.\n\nOne recent casualty of a rental surge is modern fine-dining restaurant Keystone, which closed in Stanley Street last month. Though the restaurant was packing in close to a full house during weekday lunches, the rent increase - a figure head chef Immanuel Tee declined to reveal - made it unsustainable to continue operating a fine-dining restaurant, for which margins are already slim, he says.\n\nInstead of pencilling in an 85 per cent rent increase, Sicilian restaurant Gattopardo will uproot from Hotel Fort Canning to Tras Street next January. The new space is only half its existing premises, but head chef Lino Sauro says the smaller space helps to ease the prickly problem of finding labour too.\n\n\"Our restaurant is usually about 70 per cent full on average, but we still have to staff it as though it is 100 per cent filled,\" says chef Sauro. \"I would rather have a small place that is always fully booked than a big place that is hard to fill.\"\n\nEchoing his sentiment is Vitelio Reyes, the Venezuelan head chef of South American restaurant, Sur. The 100-seater pulled in a stream of about 80 daily diners on weekdays and 200 on weekends, so its abrupt closure late last month surprised regulars. Sur was founded last December on a capital investment of $500,000 from a group of South American investors, but about $250,000 was later allegedly misused by one of the restaurant's shareholders, which sapped the restaurant's operating budget and led to its eventual demise.\n\nUnscarred, however, Mr Reyes, who is now working with another restaurant group, hopes to re-open a similar South American restaurant-bar next year. \"This time I will start small and slowly grow bigger.\"\n\nAddressing the challenges\n\nMr Reyes hopes to see more schools for sommeliers and servers being established here to encourage more locals to view these roles as a viable career, the same way prestigious culinary schools such as Le Cordon Bleu or the Culinary Institute of America have helped to make cheffing a highly regarded profession globally.\n\nOther restaurant operators have shifted their energies towards emerging markets in neighbouring South-east Asia, where labour is abundant and food, rental and operating costs are significantly lower.\n\nBesides looking for a new Singapore home for his flagship restaurant when it closes on Mount Emily on Dec 1, the Wild Rocket Group's Willin Low is currently scouting for opportunities in the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and London, where the former lawyer was educated.\n\nThe Les Amis Group will be veering away from fine dining - it shut Annam in August and will wind up Au Jardin next April - to concentrate on new restaurants in Vietnam and Myanmar. The Deliciae Group, meanwhile, plans to expand its mid-market brands such as Spanish tapas bar Sabio, L'Entrecote steakhouse and burger joint &Made, in South-east Asia next year.\n\nSupply and demand\n\nAs for rent hikes, the Deliciae Group's strategy is typically to secure long-term rents for its premises. The only exception in their stable was cocktail bar, The Vintage Room, which closed for good last week when its two-year lease could not be renewed. The unit's landlord wanted to set up a bar of his own in the space, according to The Deliciae Group's CEO, Olivier Bendel: \"A lot of people now think that because they like food and wine, and they know how to cook a little, they can open their own place,\" he observes.\n\nDespite the seemingly low barriers to entry into the F&B industry, Mr Bendel cautions: \"Running a successful restaurant requires experience, just like most other professions. It's just like if I want to become a banker tomorrow, I will fail, because that's not what I know how to do.\"\n\nCalvin Kang is, admittedly, one such F&B industry newbie. The private equity banker-turned-restaurateur behind year-old modern Korean restaurant Namu in Boat Quay will be shutting the restaurant at the end of the month for a revamp.\n\nOf the lure of restaurant ownership for bankers, Mr Kang, who set Namu up with former JP Morgan colleagues, says: \"Bankers enjoy good food and after eating out so often, they eventually want to have their own restaurant where they can host their friends and family.\" Restaurants, too, are increasingly seen as lucrative alternative investments to the stock market, which is quite risky at the moment, he adds.\n\nBut having deep pockets can turn out to be a disadvantage. The common mistake by restaurant owners with a good shore of capital is that they are \"concerned not so much about survival, but about making the restaurant look good,\" Mr Kang admits. \"When our friends or former clients come, we want to impress them. But that's not the point of business, a business needs to survive.\"\n\nHe estimates that 60 per cent of his initial capital investment went into spiffing up his three-storey Boat Quay shophouse, a figure that, looking back, he would have capped at 20 per cent. \"I now have a lot of respect for the restaurants that have lasted for years, because now I know how hard it is to run one.\"\n\nWise words, but not enough to deter bright-eyed hopefuls such as Han Liguang from entering the industry. The former management associate in a global bank left his job to enrol in At-Sunrice Culinary Academy and hopes to open his own restaurant serving modern experimental cuisine next January.\n\nHe cites the influx of foreigners, and the increasingly globalised palates of Singaporeans as plum reasons for entering the trade now, on top of the personal challenge of making it in a famously gruelling industry. \"In terms of the diversity of food and restaurant concepts, the Singapore market can certainly handle more,\" he adds.\n\nLike Mr Han, Gattopardo's chef Sauro predicts that the breakneck speed at which new restaurants are sprouting up will be something of a fixture for the next three to four years, and the industry will be able to absorb it. \"Many locals still prefer to eat in hawker centres or at home rather than in restaurants on a regular basis. There is still so much demand that is untapped locally, on top of all the foreigners who are coming in,\" he says.\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That, however, is as far as he would go in agreeing with the assessment of another security vendor, who earlier asserted that the existing security model is broken.\n\nTraditional attack methods such as spam or URL poisoning are still being used to target businesses, and these continue to be fended off by conventional security tools such as spam filters, he noted.\n\nFireEye co-founder and chief technology officer Ashar Aziz had in October said signature-based defence systems relying on a blacklist to scan and deter threats such as anti-virus software or Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are not proactive enough to detect complex malware such as APTs, which use a combination of methods to breach network security.\n\nScott Robertson, WatchGuard's vice-president of Asia-Pacific and Japan, pointed out that APTs and the ilk are \"blended attacks\" perpetrated on several threat vectors. These are vectors that are addressed by the capabilities offered by the company's Unified Threat Management (UTM) appliance.\n\nBesides its traditional strength in firewall protection, it has also partnered other leading vendors such as Sophos and Websense to include tools such as Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and Web filtering on its platform, Mr Wang added.\n\nThe integration of the different security tools into a single hardware platform was a key value proposition for small and medium-sized businesses, which explains why the 50-to-500-employee business segment is the company's \"sweet spot\", he noted.\n\nHowever, this is quickly changing as enterprises, which previously preferred standalone security tools for different applications, are increasingly seeing the value of having an integrated tool.\n\n\"If the integration between different security tools is not done properly, then (the tools)just don't work,\" Mr Wang said, adding that this leaves enterprises vulnerable to cyberattacks.\n\nThe improved hardware performance on today's chipsets have also helped gain enterprise buy-in. Today, the higher-end WatchGuard appliances can go up to 40Gbps (gigabits per second) and this was not possible a few years back, Mr Wang observed.\n\nSimilarly, overall UTM performance has improved from the past, when vendors focused primarily on firewall throughput speeds but the UTM performance was decidedly inferior. \"Companies have looked at UTM offerings in the past, but the (previous iterations) didn't perform too well, so they stuck with traditional endpoint tools,\" he explained.\n\nThese reasons have helped boost enterprise uptake of its UTM tool globally. Within Asia-Pacific itself, the company has seen a 66 per cent year-on-year growth for 2012-2013 within the 500-to-5,000-employee company demographic, said Mr Robertson.\n\nThe high growth is partly because of the small base, considering the company only started targeting this segment in the past two to three years, he added.\n\nAsia remains the smallest contributor to the company's sales, though, with about 13-14 per cent of the overall figure. The Americas continue to lead the way with 50 per cent, with the US alone accounting for 40 per cent of the sales in the region, Mr Wang said.\n\nLooking to the future, he believes the company's \"open\" platform that allows easy integration with industry-leading technologies will help it to stay competitive.\n\nHe said WatchGuard decided to revamp its product line after 2006, when the company went private after being acquired by equity firms Vector Capital and Francisco Partners. Then, they did not know what the future held in terms of technology, which is why it decided to build an open platform that can be easily upgraded, he explained.\n\nThe benefit is that it is able to quickly assimilate necessary capabilities according to market needs. One example is DLP, which Mr Wang said was the concern mainly of large enterprises two to three years ago. But as DLP grew increasingly important across a broader cross-section of the business community, WatchGuard looked around for a suitable partner, decided on Sophos, conducted the necessary integration work, and introduced its DLP product \"in months\".\n\nHe added that being a private entity helped, as it gives the company time to revamp its product line. This is why there is \"no incentive\" for the company to get listed again, he said, adding that its profitability attests to its position.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Chinese demand has slowed and resources giants are scaling back on investment. But James Fitzgerald has just got started.\n\nBy constantly thinking about how to build things better and faster, the executive chairman of mainboard-listed Civmec Ltd is leading the Australian construction and engineering company from strength to strength.\n\n\"It's how you do the work - you have to be different. We always try to put in innovation. We always sit with the client and help them solve their problems,\" Mr Fitzgerald says, speaking to The Business Times in a recent interview at the company's headquarters in Perth, Australia.\n\nCivmec decided to list here last year as it was backed by Singaporean investors.\n\nBy saving time and costs, and delivering projects on time for giant resources clients like Chevron, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, Civmec ensures a steady pipeline of work for many years to come, he says.\n\nAsked if the work will dry up, Mr Fitzgerald points to a high capital expenditure base for oil and gas, increasing demand for iron ore and expected civil infrastructure works for the next few years - areas that the company specialises in. Earlier this month, Chevron signed a deal with Japanese utility company Tohoku Electric Power for it to buy liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Australia for 20 years. Civmec does not just service new projects coming on, but also extensions to old ones.\n\n\"People say you'll run low on work. People have been saying that my entire life; it doesn't happen. You'll keep working. A new generation comes on that always wants to improve on their parents - there are always people developing and upgrading and wanting a better life,\" he says.\n\nCivmec has experienced exponential growth since it was set up a few years ago. Its latest reported revenue - a record $406 million for the full year ended June 30, 2013 - was up 23.5 per cent from $329 million in 2012 and significantly higher than the $61 million in 2011 and $22.3 million in 2010.\n\nNet profit was $36 million, up 19 per cent. The company declared a dividend of 0.7 cent a share, compared to 0.6 cent a year ago. Civmec's stock is now trading above 70 cents, compared to the 40 cents it listed at last year.\n\nThe growth should come as no surprise. Mr Fitzgerald, 50, is a 32-year veteran of Australia's construction and offshore industry. Brought up on a farm in Ireland, he says he \"started welding as a little kid\". He shifted to Australia when he was 19, worked in construction, and then founded resources contractor Ausclad Industries (AGC) in 1988, which became a subsidiary of Singapore Exchange- listed AusGroup Ltd.\n\nIn 2008, Mr Fitzgerald, then executive director, left AusGroup amid a dispute. He set up Civmec the following year. Civmec was acquired from Australian Exchange-listed VDM Group and merged with construction company Ballymount Enterprises, run by a sub-contractor he worked with, Patrick Tallon. Both Mr Tallon and Mr Fitzgerald now hold 19.5 per cent of Civmec each.\n\n\"I was turning 50 and asked my wife if I wanted to take that risk. But she said I haven't done too bad so far . . . if I had a solid company in Australia, I could give something back to community and train the locals. It's a good legacy to leave.\"\n\nToday, the company's order book stands at $200 million. One key competitive advantage the company has, Mr Fitzgerald says, is its main office and factory site by the coast at Henderson, a suburb south of Perth. The port is right next door, making shipping of constructed infrastructure hassle-free, lowering costs.\n\nThe strategic area was acquired by luck. In mid-2009, when Civmec was looking for a place to build a factory, government agency Australian Marine Complex happened to have that site for sale.\n\n\"We can make things here and just deliver it to site. If there's something wrong on the site that doesn't fit, and if it came out of China, by the time they communicate to China to get them to manufacture it, it's weeks lost. We can make it that night and send it the next day,\" he says.\n\nOne way which the company ensures prompt delivery of contracts is the close tracking of every component, cost, material and man-hours required for every project. Stainless steel tags help with the electronic tagging for some components that are put through high temperatures. \"Most companies get the job, do it, and then count the money,\" Mr Fitzgerald says.\n\n\"For us, if something is 50 per cent complete but we spent 60 per cent, then we know we're slipping. Maybe we haven't put in the right people. We can also work on the method.\n\n\"Ultimately, we want to deliver a good product for clients, on time, on budget with good quality. That's why we spend so much time on this. After that, you'll get another job.\"\n\nCivmec currently has the capabilities to build infrastructure for civil works, precast and fabrication works for everything in the iron ore mining process short of drilling and blasting, and various assembly and site works for the LNG sector, such as piping installations. The company is expanding from its Western Australian base to Darwin in the Northern Territories of Australia.\n\nIn the future, it will look at expanding overseas, such as Singapore, Malaysia, the rest of South-east Asia and Africa. Its new Henderson headquarters has four floors, but currently only the first floor is used to monitor operations, giving it plenty of room to grow.\n\n\"We are not beating drums about it. M&A companies and fund managers are approaching us with potential opportunities, but we haven't seen one yet that we're comfortable with,\" Mr Fitzgerald says.\n\nMeanwhile, he will be building Civmec, one contract at a time. \"You can't be stagnant. Once you reach a certain level, it is always in human beings to step up . . . not that we build something and that's it. I wouldn't be happy with that.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This, in turn, affected some 23,000 fibre strands and disrupted service for about 48,000 fibre connections.\n\nYesterday, OpenNet - the builder of Singapore's ultra-fast national fibre broadband network - said that restoration work on the affected fibre connections has been completed, and all connectivity issues that were previously flagged have been resolved.\n\nHowever, even though the physical cables have been pieced back together, complete connectivity and broadband service have not yet been fully restored for some customers - although the reasons for this are still unclear.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, M1 said that \"a small number\" of its fibre broadband customers \"are still facing issues\".\n\n\"We are making house calls to all these customers and working with OpenNet to help restore their connections,\" an M1 spokesman said.\n\nStarHub, meanwhile, said that its fibre broadband service to all customers in Bukit Panjang, Choa Chu Kang, and Woodlands \"now appears to be fully restored\".\n\nCompensation details for affected customers would be provided soon, it added.\n\nLike M1, StarHub will also be contacting customers affected by the outage over the next few days, to ensure that all services are indeed in order.\n\nWhile all of OpenNet's damaged cables were repaired and their affected fibre strands re-routed by last Friday, the restoration work for a portion of affected fibre connections took longer than expected.\n\nOpenNet said this was due to \"unforeseen complications\", and emphasised that \"at no time were the services of one requesting licensee prioritised over another\".\n\nThe intensive restoration process involves the splicing of each affected strand of damaged fibre, and the re-routing of each connection individually.\n\nIf any new issues arise, they will be dealt with \"on an urgent case-to-case basis\".\n\nOpenNet also said that it will work together with the rest of the industry to analyse lessons learnt from the incident, so as to improve processes in the future.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The base effect will lapse from October onwards, which spells higher transport inflation ahead,\" said DBS economist Irvin Seah.\n\nAdded Ms Chew: \"I think we should focus more on Q4 and next year. It's very clear that the trajectory is upwards. (What happened in September) is all water under the bridge. In my view, we shouldn't be rejoicing at low inflation - this is the last below-2 per cent inflation print we'll see in a long time.\"\n\nBeyond COE premiums, economists say Singapore's tight labour market and other rising cost pressures will continue to push consumer prices higher.\n\nSaid UOB economist Francis Tan in a research note: \"We reiterate that higher labour costs from the increase in foreign worker levies and the tight labour market environment pose risks to inflation (especially core inflation) in the coming months.\n\n\"This will likely impact the costs to the services industry more as they tend to have higher labour input content.\"\n\nSeptember's headline inflation came in below consensus; 16 economists polled by Bloomberg had expected last month's consumer price index (CPI) to rise 2 per cent.\n\n\"Maybe some people saw an increase in services costs in August and extrapolated from there,\" said Ms Chew, when asked what forecasters could have missed in their higher inflation projection.\n\nServices inflation, however, was stable in September at 2.7 per cent, as the stronger pick-up in the cost of recreation & entertainment and holiday travel was offset by lower contributions from education and household services fees.\n\nAccommodation costs, meanwhile, went up by 3.9 per cent, slightly lower than the 4.2 per cent rise in August. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said this largely reflected a smaller increase in market rentals for both private and HDB properties.\n\nANZ economist Daniel Wilson believes inflation will remain below 2 per cent next month, \"with the final disbursement of the rebate for Service & Conservancy Charges offsetting rising private transport costs\".\n\nMAS core inflation - which excludes costs of accommodation and private road transport - slowed slightly to 1.7 per cent in September, from 1.8 per cent in August.\n\nThe government again said that overall imported inflation is expected to remain subdued, given spare production capacity in the advanced economies, and ample supply buffers in the commodity markets.\n\n\"However, the pass- through of domestic costs to prices of consumer services could intensify as a result of the rising cost pressures that firms are facing from business rentals, COE premiums for commercial vehicles, and labour costs,\" said MAS and MTI in their statement.\n\nTaking these factors into account, MAS core inflation is expected to rise \"over the next few quarters\", and average 1.5-2 per cent in 2013, and 2-3 per cent in 2014.\n\nThe government also reiterated that headline inflation is projected to come in at 2.5-3 per cent in 2013, and 2-3 per cent in 2014.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This meant that while the offshore & marine segment contributed almost three-quarters of the group's net profit during the same period last year, at 72 per cent, it only managed to contribute about half of this total this time round, at 53 per cent.\n\nThe offshore & marine division's weaker performance was offset by a strong showing from the infrastructure and property divisions.\n\nBut analysts remain optimistic about Keppel's offshore & marine business because of handsome profit margins and a healthy pipeline of orders yet to come.\n\nAccording to Barclays, Keppel's strong profit margins in the rig business still position the company as a market leader.\n\n\"The company's offshore & marine segment delivered an operating margin of 16.5 per cent for a fourth sequential quarter-on-quarter increase in operating margins. This further consolidates its position as the most profitable rig-builder in the industry currently,\" it said.\n\nIt added that the strong margin was a result of the delivery of five KFELS B class jack-up rigs, which are repeat designs, in Q3 as well as a higher volume of higher-margin repair work during the period. Barclays believed that the margins will have positive implications for Keppel's stock price, with an upside of as much as 21 per cent and a target price of $13.10.\n\nKeppel's order flow year-to-date has also been healthy, with the world's largest rig builder by volume securing about $5 billion of new orders, said OCBC.\n\nIt also said that Keppel's net order book stood at a record $13.6 billion at the end of September, compared with $13.1 billion at the end of June. OCBC maintained a buy rating on Keppel with a $12.87 fair value estimate.\n\nAnalysts are also impressed with Keppel's progress in the construction of the first semi-submersible rig for Sete Brasil, which is on track to be completed by Q4 2015. The company estimates the current completion rate of the first unit at between 20-50 per cent. It expects the rig to leave Singapore early next year to reach its Brazilian yard by February next year.\n\nHowever, Keppel's strong exposure to Brazilian orders may prove to be a long-term risk, according to Jefferies Group. \"Nearly half of Keppel's outstanding order book relates to Petrobras orders. These orders are based on new designs, come with specific provisions on local content and will be largely executed in the Brazilian shipyards owned by Keppel which, in our view, exposes it to a larger degree of execution risks. We forecast a 13-14 per cent operating margin over the 2013-15 period.\"\n\nJefferies issued a buy rating on Keppel with a $12.50 target price based on a sum-of-parts valuation.\n\nKeppel still has yard slots available for jack-up rigs for 2015 delivery, which analysts felt could allow the company to add to its order book in the next few months.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This year, the government expects headline inflation to register in the upper range of the 2 to 3 per cent forecast. For next year, headline inflation is projected to come in at between 2 and 3 per cent.\n\nThe official estimate for core inflation is between 1.5 and 2 per cent this year, and between 2 and 3 per cent next year.\n\nAssistant professor Aurobindo Ghosh, the co-creator of SInDEx and project director of SKBI, noted that headline inflation has come down from the first quarter of 2013 as a result of a slew of government measures to cool the property market and curb car loans, as well as the deleveraging of household debt - the combined effect of which was not expected a year ago.\n\n\"Academic literature has shown that inflation expectations are quite persistent or 'sticky', and are often slow to react downwards,\" Prof Ghosh said.\n\n\"Additionally, there is an expectation of pass- through costs, including domestic ones like wages and rental, and imported ones like oil prices, which might have caused elevated expectations of price rises in the medium term.\n\n\"For policymakers, this might indicate some risks to the anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations for both headline rate and the core inflation rate in Singapore.\"\n\nDr Yuwa Hedrick- Wong, the global economic advisor for MasterCard, said that inflation expectations are still relatively high despite the downward trend, possibly due to a combination of the pick-up in the US and European economies and the positive impact of the expansionary policies in Japan.\n\n\"At the same time, this has to also be seen in the context of Asia's growth shifting to a lower gear with the slowdown in big emerging economies like China and India, which is likely to adversely affect Singapore's open economy, vulnerable to external market conditions,\" he added.\n\nThe report also polled respondents on what they expected inflation would be in five years. This worked out to 4.7 per cent for the composite index, up slightly from 4.68 per cent from the June edition of the survey.\n\nHeadline inflation in five years is expected to clock in at 4.86 per cent - the lowest figure recorded so far - down from 4.99 per cent.\n\nCore inflation is expected to rise to 4.6 per cent from 4.45 per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We consider 999-year leasehold to be the same as freehold, because their difference in value is negligible.\n\nFreehold properties hold a few advantages over their leasehold counterparts - higher en-bloc potential, slower pace of depreciation and no restrictions on the use of Central Provident Fund for home purchases.\n\nIn recent years, new leasehold condominiums seem to have dominated the market. The proportions of new leasehold and freehold condominium sales stand at 95 per cent to 5 per cent respectively as of first half of 2013. In contrast, back in 2006 and 2007, around 70 per cent of new sales were freehold. This could be attributed to the ramp-up of the government land sales programme in recent years and the tightening of en- bloc rules in October 2007.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Property\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM", "images": []}

In practical terms that means the world could witness another sequel to the game of brinkmanship over the US budget early next year, including another shutdown of the government and renewed threats to allow it to default.\n\nThe deal did come up with a legislative mechanism to help avert fiscal warfare by establishing a congressional committee consisting of leading Democratic and Republican lawmakers whose task would be to complete work on a 10-year US budget plan by Dec 13 that would reconcile separate budget plans approved by the Democratic-controlled Senate and the Republican-led House of Representatives early this year. In turn, that kind of agreement could serve as the basis for a \"grand bargain\" on fiscal policy between the White House and Congress, turning the current ceasefire into a long-term peace agreement between the two rival powers on Capitol Hill. But the expectation that the so-called budget conference committee, led by Representative Paul Ryan of the Republican party and Senator Patty Murray, his Democratic counterpart, will succeed in reaching such a deal before this Christmas remains very low.\n\nOne sticking point is the disagreement between the two sides on how to adjust the across-the-board automatic spending cuts that began in March. The Democrats assert that the economic austerity produced by the spending cuts hurts the middle class and the poor and slows down the economic recovery, while the Republicans argue that major cuts in the large government-funded social-economic programmes are necessary to reduce the federal deficit. But central to these policy disagreements is the wide ideological divide between the two political parties, with Democrats saying that more tax revenue is necessary in order to reduce the deficit, and Republicans arguing that spending cuts will do the job.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Columns\n\nEroding US exceptionalism will impact world economy\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nBye-bye America First?\n\nJul 15, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

If total shareholder return is up, the theory goes, stockholders have no right to complain about what might otherwise look like outsize pay at their companies.\n\nWhile this pay posture is understandable, it raises a question: should a rising stock price inoculate top executives from criticism over their pay? To more and more experts in corporate finance and pay issues, the answer is no.\n\nAswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University, is among those who think that too many companies rely too heavily on the performance of their shares when computing executive compensation. \"I'm a great believer in markets, but sometimes we need more attention paid to what did this management do to the value of the company and less to what did this management do to the price of the stock,\" he said. \"I would like to see compensation systems where managers are rewarded based on what kind of projects they are working on and how big their returns on invested capital are.\" Yet, the focus on stock price appreciation as a benchmark for corporate performance and executive pay lives on. Firms still rely heavily on it, and so do the powerful proxy advisory services that suggest how shareholders should vote on pay practices and director elections.\n\nThe fact is, total shareholder returns are almost always among the performance measures - if not the single biggest consideration - used by companies to determine pay. This focus doesn't just leave out a wide array of measures that better capture whether a company's management is operating in the interests of investors with a long-term horizon; it also allows top executives to reap the pay benefits associated with a short-term bullish stock market, which may have nothing to do with their company's specific business or operations, pay experts contend.\n\n\"A statistic I've seen that makes sense to me is that 70 per cent of executives' stock option gains are attributable to the market's movement as a whole,\" said Nell Minow, a principal at GMI Ratings, a corporate governance analytics company. \"We are basically paying CEOs for floating on their backs when we should be paying them to win races.\" The fault is not simply with executives themselves, of course. A failure to weigh a variety of performance metrics that can warn when a company isn't creating long-term shareholder value is the responsibility of the company's board.\n\nShareholders, too, have to hold themselves accountable for these failures, Ms Minow said. Their support for pay plans that reward executives for just showing up or for being on hand while their stock is rising only reinforces a questionable reward system. \"This is something for which we have to blame ourselves,\" she said.\n\nWith that in mind, Mark Van Clieaf, an organisational consultant and principal at Organizational Capital Partners, is urging companies' boards to use other measures to assess whether their executives are truly creating value for shareholders or destroying it. The best measure, he says, is a company's net returns on its invested capital. That is, how much it is generating on its capital investments - plants and equipment, say - minus the costs of that capital, whether debt or equity.\n\n\"Management should be providing value that exceeds its cost of capital,\" Mr Van Clieaf said. \"A company with a negative return on capital can't generate enough free cash flow to pay dividends and enhance the value of the firm over time.\"\n\nIn spite of this relatively simple concept, Mr Van Clieaf said, few companies appear to use net returns on invested capital, also known as economic profit or loss, when determining executive pay. This is something of a disconnect, given that these returns are a crucial measure of how effectively a company is deploying its capital in projects that pay off, and are certainly figures that chief executives and their finance colleagues watch closely. Moreover, returns on capital are a useful measure across industries.\n\nNeither do shareholders seem to be demanding such a measure when their companies' boards devise executive pay. \"Investors are looking at total shareholder return, but that's not the be-all, end-all metric,\" Mr Van Clieaf said. \"So just because a company had a positive say-on- pay vote doesn't mean the system is working well.\" The trouble with relying on total shareholder returns is that these figures can rise even after a company has shown an economic loss - a negative return on capital - over an extended period. A focus on stock price, therefore, can mask a longer-term decline in a company's financial footing.\n\nAn extreme example of a company that had returns on invested capital that were below its cost of capital is WorldCom, the telecoms darling that collapsed in 2002. According to Foundations of Economic Value Added, a book by James L Grant, from 1993 to 2000 return on invested capital at WorldCom ranged from 2.23 per cent to a high of 9.5 per cent, but the company's cost of capital was more than 10 per cent throughout this time. For much of that time period, WorldCom's stock price was rising.\n\nWorldCom, of course, was in a category by itself. But the message is clear: a stock price does not always reflect real economic value. Mr Van Clieaf labels these kinds of companies \"value myths\" because on the surface they are producing gains for shareholders but underneath they are generating negative returns on their investments in plants, equipment, acquisitions or other items.\n\nTo illustrate this point, Organizational Capital Partners generated a list of eight large companies that for each of the five years through December 2012 generated a negative net return on invested capital. The firm also looked at other metrics, like revenue growth or decline, total shareholder returns and cumulative executive pay over the period. The analysis also includes the results of the latest shareholder votes on each company's pay practices.\n\nThese say-on-pay votes are not binding on the company but represent shareholders' views on the pay programmes in place. Most of the companies received broad support for their pay practices from most of the shareholders voting at the most recent annual meetings. Only three of the eight - ConocoPhillips, Dow Chemical and Tenet Healthcare - encountered objections from over a quarter of their shareholders voting on the executive pay plans.\n\nThe eight companies that generated a negative net return on invested capital, ranked by the amount of executive pay, are Anadarko Petroleum, Dow Chemical, ConocoPhillips, Tenet Healthcare, Johnson Controls, Apache, Devon Energy and Textron. Most of the companies are in basic industries like energy, chemicals and industrial products. Five of the companies had shareholder returns that beat the S&P 500's returns over the five-year period. These were, in descending order, Tenet, Dow Chemical, Anadarko Petroleum, Johnson Controls and ConocoPhillips. The remaining three companies - Apache, Devon Energy and Textron - had negative shareholder returns.\n\nWhen these findings were shared with all eight companies, some (like ConocoPhillips, Dow Chemical and Tenet Healthcare) did not respond to email requests. Others (like Devon Energy, Anadarko Petroleum, Johnson Controls and Textron) declined to comment, referring me to proxy filings that outline their compensation practices.\n\nAt Apache, the board is focused on getting pay for performance right and has been engaging its shareholders, said Sarah B Teslik, senior VP for policy and governance. Investors like how much of the company's executive compensation is tied to measurable corporate goals, she said, and the fact that the company has substantially reduced the pay that Apache executives actually realise, meaning it is not earned if the performance goals are not met.\n\nGiven the shareholder support that most of these companies received in their most recent say-on-pay votes, it is clear that investors seem content with their pay practices. To Mr Van Clieaf, this is a sign that investors are not digging sufficiently into the numbers to determine whether companies are creating long-term shareholder value.\n\nMonitoring these returns is important work for investors, he said, because companies that do not earn positive returns on their invested capital may not be able to pay dividends to shareholders. And those dividends make up one of the bigger income streams pension managers look for to meet their obligations to retirees. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom: survey\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

But achieving an effective practical solution will need more work.\n\nThe new system will allow the countries - Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and Thailand - to track down those responsible for causing the haze and take the necessary action against the culprits. At the Asean Summit in Brunei last week, the leaders of these nations openly committed to share important satellite data to help them locate fires and determine when they are occurring on land owned by plantation companies.\n\nWhile environmentalists cheered the formal adoption of such information-sharing, many are of the view that better monitoring of the haze may not result in better enforcement. For example, the Washington-based World Resources Institute said in a recent report that the responsibility for the fires could be assessed only with thorough, impartial investigations on the ground and more maps of land and plantation concessions.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Columns\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week", "images": []}

They put in new floors and kitchen cabinets, and in the borough's tight market for rentals under US$1,000 a month, they had no problem finding new tenants.\n\nBut not long after the remodelling, city building inspectors swooped in. They made the tenants move out, they ordered the Sarkars to dismantle the rental unit and they imposed an initial penalty of US$1,200.\n\nThe couple's offence: an illegal conversion.\n\nThe Sarkars are still removing debris after taking down the kitchen and the wall that used to divide the studio-size space. \"I had to wreck everything,\" said Rakha Sarkar, 34, a stay-at-home mother who lives with her husband, a limousine driver, and their two children in the two-storey home in Richmond Hill.\n\nNew York City's Department of Buildings issues more than 4,400 violations a year for illegally converted basements, cellars and attics that cannot be occupied because of health and safety hazards, like poor ventilation or a lack of multiple exits.\n\nBut with the scarcity of affordable housing in the city and with many New Yorkers already living in makeshift apartments, some housing advocates are calling for a new approach. They want the city to legalise at least some of these units by waiving certain laws, as the city administration did last year to test so-called micro-units. Smaller than the current 450-square-foot minimum for studios, such micro-units are planned for a Manhattan building scheduled to open in 2015 in a pilot project.\n\n\"Micro-units are the high-end version of the basement units,\" said city councilman Brad Lander, who said that he was drafting legislation to create a new category for \"accessory\" dwelling units and specific zoning and building code standards for them. \"There are a lot of units that are perfectly safe that can't be made legal under current rules.\"\n\nThe push for more flexibility is coming from elected officials, community groups and building industry professionals who say that unauthorised units continue to flourish despite enforcement crackdowns because they meet pressing needs: they house lower-income tenants, they help homeowners pay mortgages and they accommodate some of the city's growing population.\n\nRelaxing the rules, though, can be a tough sell among neighbours who see illegal units as a drain on schools, hospitals, parking and other resources.\n\nThis year, legalisation has made it onto the advocacy agenda of housing groups and the platform of the Democratic mayoral nominee, Bill de Blasio, who has singled out illegal basements and \"granny flats\" as possible additions to the city's rent-regulated housing stock. Mr De Blasio lived in a basement apartment in Astoria, Queens, in the 1980s but \"can't say for sure\" whether it was legal, his campaign spokesman Dan Levitan said.\n\nLargely written to prevent slum conditions and firetraps, New York's housing regulations have not kept up with changing cultural norms and increasing financial pressures, some housing experts said. It is, for example, illegal for more than three unrelated adults to live together in New York City. That law is widely broken and infrequently enforced.\n\nFor many students and new immigrants, sharing space has long been the most affordable housing option in the city. New economic challenges, the experts said, have spurred even more demand for such arrangements.\n\n\"There are ways we can allow people to live in different kinds of configurations that would be cheaper for them,\" said Ingrid Gould Ellen, a co-director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University.\n\nA 2008 study by two nonprofit groups - the Pratt Center for Community Development and the Chhaya Community Development - found the city's illegal \"accessory\" units to be concentrated in immigrant neighbourhoods of Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx, where they rented for as little as one-third below market rates. That study estimated the size of \"the housing underground\" - illegal basements, rooming houses, commercial lofts and other such dwellings - at more than 114,000 units.\n\nAdvocates of legalising some of these units - the ones that are safe or can be made safe by adding doors and windows and are not prone to flooding - are now focusing on those that could easily come into compliance if laws were more flexible or conversion rules and costs more manageable.\n\nAdditional housing stock could be created, for instance, by allowing conversions of cellars, which currently can never be rented or occupied. (Under the city's regulations, the lowest level of a structure is a cellar if more than half the height is below curb level; if at least half of its height is above curb level, then it is considered a basement.)\n\nUnlike cellars, basements in homes can be rented out when zoning permits, as long as they have a second way out and meet minimum requirements for air, light and sanitation, city officials said. But such conversions can cost around US$15,000, and securing the necessary permits can take a long time, said Seema Agnani, the executive director of Chhaya.\n\nThe group is lobbying city officials for a pilot programme to test conversions of both cellars and basements. That would include financial incentives, like low-cost loans; a property tax abatement; and free engineering assistance to examine and improve conditions. It also seeks to have the units designated as rent-regulated to maintain them affordable.\n\nBuildings Department officials said that they received 18,126 complaints about illegal units last year, and the Queens borough president Helen Marshall said that she had not heard a lot of support for the legalisation effort.\n\n\"What we do hear is complaints about excessive number of residents in illegal and unsafe dwellings, multiple electrical boxes that indicate the structure is not being used legally, excessive garbage buildup and the danger of fire,\" Ms Marshall said.\n\nBut advocates of legalisation say that the point is to deal with an existing problem and allow better city planning. \"We want a path to legalisation,\" said Jerilyn Perine, executive director of the research group Citizens Housing and Planning Council and a former city housing commissioner. \"Not every unit should be legalised, but there are some that could.\" NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM", "images": []}

Obama will make clear \"the need for Congress to act to pay our bills,\" a White House official said on condition of anonymity.\n\nWith no breakthrough in sight, the Dow slipped 76.10 points at 15,161.01, five minutes into trading. The broader S&P 500 lost 8.41 to 1,694.79, and the Nasdaq Composite gave up 16.27 to 3,775.60.\n\nAsian markets also retreated yesterday with traders growing nervous that talks to raise the US borrowing limit remain deadlocked while European stocks fluctuated between gains and losses.\n\nIn the currency market, the greenback sank against most major currencies. The dollar depreciated 0.4 per cent to 98.18 yen after rising 1.9 per cent in the previous four days as the yen gained from safe-haven demand. The dollar fell 0.3 per cent to US$1.3584 against the euro.\n\nDemocratic Majority Leader Harry Reid and Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell spoke on Sunday but failed to agree on a deal to raise federal borrowing authority above the US$16.7 trillion debt limit set by Congress. Separately, they also could not agree on a plan to pass a funding bill and reopen a government still shuttered on its 14th day.\n\nMr Reid said on Sunday that he had a \"productive conversation\" with Mr McConnell without reaching a conclusion on a plan to send to the Democratic-controlled chamber for a vote.\"The discussions were substantive and we'll continue those discussions\" Mr Reid said on the Senate floor as the parties remained divided over federal spending levels. \"I'm optimistic about the prospects for a positive conclusion.\"\n\nMr Reid and Mr McConnell - five-term senators hardened by budget disputes and years of negotiations - are at an impasse over the automatic, across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration that took effect earlier this year. Republicans want to keep spending at the reduced levels while Democrats are pressing for a higher amount.\n\nThe shutdown has furloughed 350,000 federal workers, impeded various government services, put continued operations of the federal courts in doubt and stopped the federal tax agency from processing tax refunds. Several parks and monuments remain closed, drawing a protest at the National World War II Memorial on Sunday that included conservative tea party-backed lawmakers who had unsuccessfully demanded the defunding of President Barack Obama's three-year-old healthcare law in exchange for keeping the government open. \"I'm optimistic about the prospects for a positive conclusion to the issues before this country today,\" Mr Reid said as the Senate wrapped up a rare Sunday session.\n\nMr McConnell insisted a solution was readily available as he embraced the proposal from a bipartisan group of 12 senators, led by Republican Senator Susan Collins and Democratic Senator Joe Manchin that would re-open the government and fund it at current levels for six months while raising the debt limit through Jan 31.\n\nIt also would give agencies greater flexibility in dealing with the automatic budget cuts, delay a new medical device tax for two years and establish income verification for individuals receiving subsidies to buy health insurance.\n\nBut six Democrats in the group and a spokesman for Ms Collins said late Sunday that while negotiations continued this weekend, there was no agreement. Politically, Republicans are reeling, bearing a substantial amount of the blame for the government shutdown and stalemate. Republican Senator Bob Corker, who has been a key player in previous negotiations, told NBC's Today show yesterday that he believes the strategy of tea party-supported House Republicans to demand a retreat on the new healthcare law was \"not one that bore fruit\". But he charges that Senate Democrats, led by Mr Reid, engaged in \"overreach\" on Sunday in trying to get the Republicans to undo or roll back the automatic spending cuts that were the result of a 2011 budget deal.\n\nMr McConnell and Republicans want to continue current spending at US$986.7 billion and leave untouched the new round of cuts on Jan 15 that would reduce the amount to US$967 billion. Democrats want to undo the automatic reductions, plus a long-term extension of the debt limit increase and a short-term spending bill to reopen the government.\n\nUnclear was whether any Senate deal would pass the Republican-controlled House by Thursday, though Senate Democrats were hoping momentum and an imminent default would pressure House lawmakers.

It's challenging collecting money in Singapore. It's difficult because we're seeing more mainland Chinese customers.\"\n\nAlthough total mass win per day for the quarter climbed 2 per cent to US$4.52 million from US$4.43 million a year ago, Mr Goldstein said MBS's goal was US$5 million a day. \"If we can get that number, the overall Ebitda in that property will accelerate quite a bit.\"\n\nAsked if MBS is giving more rooms away to the premium mass segment to attract more foreign visitors, he said: \"The mass market was driven by locals. Now we're moving towards more foreign visitation (which is up 46 per cent year on year). To get premium mass (win per day) beyond US$4.2 million to US$4.5 million a day, our focus has been on driving foreign visitation, which requires flying in customers, and rooms. So we are buying more rooms from the hotel, and that may have an adverse effect on margins.\"\n\nWhen discussing Singapore's mass gaming potential at an investment forum late last month, LVS president and chief operating officer Michael Leven remarked that he was \"amazed that Singapore only does US$6,000 to US$7,000 a table in a very limited capacity. I think it has potential to do more Macau-type numbers, US$9,000 to US$11,000 a table\".\n\n\"We had a setback in Q2 2012 with the government issue in terms of (local visitation). That's going to affect any market. But we've rebounded back. Singapore is going to do better. It's unfortunate it's a long way from mainland China, which drives Macau. But we have a lot of confidence in the strength of the mass market. I'm convinced we will bounce back to US$5 million a day. That's respectable but still a long way from Macau metrics,\" he added.\n\nFor the third quarter, mass-market revenues rose 2.65 per cent to US$1.16 billion, while slot play, which includes electronic table games, jumped 5.34 per cent to US$2.76 billion.\n\nMBS's net revenues totalled US$774.2 million for the third quarter, of which US$628.1 million came from the casino, and the remainder from retail, hotel rooms and restaurants. That is up from US$625.5 million a year ago.\n\nThe hotel's average daily rate jumped 11 per cent to US$401 in Q3 from US$361 a year ago. Occupancy remained steady at 99.8 per cent for the quarter.\n\nLVS posted net earnings of US$626.7 million, or 76 US cents a share, on revenue of US$3.57 billion for the third quarter. A year earlier, net earnings were US$349.8 million, or 42 US cents a share, on revenue of US$2.71 billion.\n\nLVS shares closed unchanged yesterday at US$70.97.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Expectations were for a 2.8 per cent drop, leading at least one economist to see NODX picking up gradually.\n\n\"NODX remains weak, but the contraction has eased,\" observed Chua Hak Bin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nWith last month's decline, Dr Chua estimates that NODX fell 3.3 per cent in Q3, smaller than the 8.9 per cent decline in the first two quarters of the year.\n\nShipments to the United States and China, two of Singapore's largest markets, have recovered strongly, he said. The top three contributors to the export contraction were the European Union, South Korea and Japan.\n\nNODX's growth momentum looks set to pick up. Compared to the previous month, September NODX jumped a seasonally adjusted 5.7 per cent, after slipping 6.6 per cent in August.\n\nSaid Michael Wan of Credit Suisse: \"Moving forward, we expect Singapore's export recovery to broaden and gather momentum on stronger global demand, given that growth in the US is expected to accelerate and Europe is likely to continue its move out of recession into recovery.\"\n\nEven so, the turnaround may have come a little too late. OCBC's Selena Ling noted that despite the improvement in recent months, NODX had so far dropped 6.7 per cent year-on-year. With three more months to go before year-end, she reckons that NODX is likely to undershoot the official growth forecast of 0-1 per cent for this year.\n\n\"Our 2013 NODX growth forecast is -5.5% year-on-year, likely the worst performance since 2009 (-10.6%), and assuming Q4 NODX growth improves further to -0.6%,\" she said.\n\nFrancis Tan and Jimmy Koh of UOB reckon that to meet the official growth forecast, NODX would have to grow between 22.6 per cent and 26.7 per cent on average in the last quarter.\n\n\"Although we are experiencing a cyclical recovery in global electronics demand which will boost electronic exports, it will likely be a muted one, which at best, we may only likely see lower single-digit year-on-year growth rates till the end of this year,\" they said.\n\nElectronic NODX fell year-on-year for the 14th straight month in September, even though the decline eased to 5.5 per cent in September from 9.2 per cent the previous month\n\nNon-electronic shipments swung to a 0.9 per cent increase, from a 5.6 per cent decline.\n\nThough NODX remains in negative territory, economists at Citigroup, Barclays and Bank of America Merrill Lynch remain hopeful the economy will grow for the full year.\n\n\"The services sector is supporting economic growth,\" said Dr Chua of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \"Recent re-export readings are in line with government guidance of 'healthy expansion' in wholesale trade services.\"\n\nLatest trade data showed that non-oil re-exports jumped 12.7 year-on-year last month, after rising 14.4 per cent in August.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

His thin figure is framed by the cloudy sky while the upright drying planks all point - almost in veneration - towards him.\n\nTaken in either the 1960s or the 1970s, the photo is a quiet tribute to the anonymous worker whose sweat and toil built this city but whose contributions often go unsung. With the masterly framed yet unassuming photo, Chua captures this fact elegantly.\n\nChua's is one of the many strong and evocative artworks that feature in National Museum of Singapore's upcoming exhibition A Changed World: Singapore Art 1950s - 1970s.\n\nMuch of the art represents the dramatic changes Singapore underwent in its transformation from a third-world nation to a cosmopolitan hub.\n\nThe works range from photography and paintings to sculpture and woodblock prints, and they include some outstanding pieces from the National Collection that have not been displayed in public for a while.\n\nCo-curated by Szan Tan and Daniel Tham, the exhibition informs the viewer of not just the early makings of a city but also the creative throes of our pioneer artists as they struggled to find a visual style to call their own.\n\nTham notes that the historical exhibition acts as a foil to the large-scale contemporary artworks that will be unveiled next week at the Singapore Biennale, which carries the tagline If The World Changed.\n\n\"This may be the first time we're presenting history quite specifically through art,\" says Tham. \"We're attempting to chart the development of the nation as well as the development of art to show their concurrent histories.\"\n\nOne of the first works you see as you enter the exhibition is Liu Kang's National Day, showing the various races of Singaporeans interacting on the Padang as rows of commemorative banners on the Supreme Court and City Hall buildings form the backdrop. In typically modernist fashion reminiscent of Matisse, Liu paints a shower of colours and simplified figures that lend a certain timelessness to the image. His depiction of different races also makes the painting one of the earliest representations of multiculturalism in local art.\n\nAnother terrific work is Ong Kim Seng's watercolour work simply titled Jalan Bukit Merah Block 106. In the 1960s, Ong and his family were asked to move from a kampung on Silat Road to a HDB development in Jalan Bukit Merah. But even as the block was being built, Ong decided to paint an image of his future block surrounded by scaffoldings. What makes the work particularly compelling is the strong sense of nostalgia it conveys - as if Ong was thinking of his old home even as he painted his new one.\n\nAnother work to watch out for is Abdul Ghani Hamid's semi-abstract work titled The Face In Mediation that depicts a human in reverie. This fine artwork exemplifies earlier attempts by Singapore artists to combine the artistic traditions of their own cultures with the larger artistic developments in the world - specifically in this case, the rise of abstract expressionism popularised by Pollock, de Kooning and others.\n\nOther works that also impress include Lim Hak Tai's semi-abstract Riot depicting the riots of the 1950s, Lim Yew Kwan's woodblock print After The Fire portraying a kampung house razed to the ground by a fire, and Lai Kui Fang's detailed social realistic painting Construction of Sheares Bridge.\n\nWhen the Singapore Biennale opens next Friday, it will showcase some of the boldest contemporary art in South-east Asia today. But for a dose of national pride, do include a visit to the National Museum's Exhibition Gallery 2 in your itinerary.\n\n'A Changed World: Singapore Art 1950s - 1970s' is on display next week from Oct 25, 2013 to March 14, 2015, from 10am to 7pm daily.

Markets will be supported by a low interest rate environment and plenty of central bank liquidity, Romain Boscher, global head of equities for Amundi Asset Management, told The Business Times in an interview yesterday.\n\nInvestors, meanwhile, expect the current US debt ceiling crisis to blow over. The effects of any short-term crisis will be mitigated by strong corporate balance sheets and sufficient foreign reserves of emerging markets such as China and Russia, he added.\n\n\"The debt ceiling crisis is a good excuse to speed up moves from US assets to European assets. It is quite easy to take profit and find new opportunities either in Asia ex Japan and other places where markets are far from their historical highs,\" he said.\n\nAmundi, which managed US$177 billion of equities as at end-June, has US$93 billion in European equities. Mr Boscher said that the manager prefers to put money in European assets followed by emerging markets.\n\n\"Valuations are becoming compelling in China. People have been scared by the Chinese economic slowdown. It's good to be slightly contrarian,\" he said. \"Excluding banks, there are many opportunities. We are also considering Taiwanese options.\"\n\nMr Boscher, who runs Amundi's equities business, said that investors are not worried about the ongoing political crisis in the US that threatens a historical default on US government debt amid a government shutdown. \"The average shutdown was six days. Now it might last six weeks. People are not pleased, even as they are not scared,\" he said.\n\nThe original deadline for debt default has become a moving target, having gone from Oct 17 to end-October, he added, pointing out that the latest talk is for a deal to avert a default by six weeks. \"They're not going to commit suicide. It is not even in the Republican interest, with surveys showing that . . . US citizens would blame Republicans first. It's a democracy. There are elections to come at the end of the day.\"\n\nGlobal economic outlook is looking better for a number of reasons. First, the 3.5 per cent world GDP growth expected next year is \"more than decent\" and is driven by a convergence of growth between developed and emerging countries. This points to a stronger scenario than if the world economy was relying on one economy like China, he said.\n\nAfter the last few years, when equity market recovery was driven by higher price-earnings ratios valuations, growth ahead looks like it will be driven by fundamental earnings per share (EPS) growth, he said. Amundi expects a 12 per cent EPS growth for Europe next year, above the 9 per cent EPS growth for US companies.\n\nAlso driving the case for equities is a low interest rate environment that looks set to continue, tapering or no tapering. \"People should pay more attention to the monetary base. Look at what the Bank of Japan has committed to inject, what the European Central Bank could inject. The room for liquidity injection in Japan and Europe is significant and can more than compensate for US tapering,\" he said.\n\nCentral banks will continue to keep interest rates low also because of high public-sector debt. With public debt not stabilising for the US and Japan, central banks there cannot run the risk of high interest rates leading to unsustainable debt repayments, he added.\n\nAmid low interest rates, equities are \"the only place where you can have access to a decent dividend yield of 3 to 4 per cent in Asia and Europe,\" he said. \"With the outlook improving day after day, you can even experience capital gains.\"\n\nAlmost a third of inflows into Amundi's equity funds in the past year have gone into its next generation range of strategies that, among others, aim to minimise volatility. Assets under management in these strategies amount to US$7.1 billion at end-June, and have been popular with institutions and the mass market, he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Revenue for the quarter was $20.5 million, down 5.5 per cent from $21.7 million a year earlier.\n\nThis stemmed from reduced revenue from Kim Kang's disposal, which was partially offset by higher sales volume of dragon fish in China, rising contributions from a new Indonesian subsidiary and increased exports.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Companies & Markets\n\nUS: Nasdaq hits new record as markets shrug off tariff talk\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:13 AM\n\nZuckerberg says Meta will invest hundreds of billions in superintelligence\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:48 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLinkedIn settles antitrust lawsuit, agrees to contracting changes\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:12 PM\n\nUS: Wall Street opens mixed as investors digest fresh tariff threats\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:43 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM", "images": []}

This, the company attributed to higher revenue from its data centre and logistics divisions.\n\nEven so, Keppel T&T's operating profit fell 10.5 per cent to $5.1 million, mostly because of lower operating profit from its logistics segment during the quarter.\n\nHowever, a 14.6 per cent increase in contributions from associated and jointly controlled firms - totalling $15.6 million - helped to lift the quarterly bottom line.\n\nFor the nine months to September, net profit was up 7.8 per cent at $45.5 million, while revenue stood at $117 million, a 14.2 per cent increase.\n\nOver the nine months, the bulk of the revenue continued to come from the company's logistics segment, which saw external sales increase 14.5 per cent to $78.9 million. The data centre segment's external sales grew 13.7 per cent to $38.1 million.\n\nEven so, the data centre segment outshone logistics on the bottom line, with the former's operating profit rising 23.9 per cent to $16.6 million during the nine-month period, driven by higher occupancy and management fee income.\n\nYesterday, Keppel T&T said that work on the group's third data centre in Singapore was \"progressing well\".\n\n\"Demand for data centre services remains strong in its key markets and the group expects to reap more benefits from this trend through seeking new data centre development projects,\" it said.\n\nThe logistics segment posted a 16.3 per cent decline in operating profit to $8.7 million because of the higher overhead costs incurred to implement new development projects, the company said.\n\nIn the third quarter of the year, the group bought a 60 per cent stake in Sanshui port, located in Guangdong province, China.\n\n\"The group has also commenced work for the integrated cold chain logistics park in Lu'an City, Anhui province,\" Keppel T&T said.\n\n\"In Singapore, work on the two-hectare logistics facility in Tampines is on schedule. The group will continue to pursue its growth strategy in China and South-east Asia.\"\n\nEarnings per share for the group were 2.5 cents and 8.2 cents for the quarter and nine-month period, respectively, up from 2.4 cents and 7.6 cents during the corresponding periods the year before.\n\nShares of the company closed at $1.53 yesterday, up 1.3 per cent or two cents, before the results were announced.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Said the latter: \"The MAS de-emphasised the drop in headline and core inflation in Q2, and instead pointed to the recent pick-up in July-August as foreshadowing further rises in the quarters ahead.\"\n\nCoupled with a tight labour market, the central bank said that core inflation - which excludes costs of accommodation and private road transport - is expected to be 1.5-2 per cent in 2013, and rise to 2-3 per cent in 2014. With upside core inflation risks looming, economists from Nomura, Citi, DBS and UOB say that a tightening of monetary policy in April could be on the cards - particularly if prices rise beyond the government's comfort zone.\n\nSaid Nomura analysts in a report: \"Overall, the statement should raise market expectations of the MAS shifting towards an even tighter (foreign exchange) policy stance at the April 2014 meeting.\"\n\nAdded Citi economist Kit Wei Zheng: \"Though not our forecast, with the possibility that core inflation may breach the MAS's implicit 2-2.5 per cent tolerance threshold in 2014, slope steepening in April 2014 cannot be ruled out, especially if growth uncertainties subside.\"\n\nCalling such a scenario \"definitely possible\", UOB economist Francis Tan said: \"It would have to be fuelled by something completely unanticipated, like if oil prices suddenly spike up due to renewed political tensions in the Middle East. Then the MAS will probably move in to tighten the Singapore dollar NEER.\"\n\nStill, Mr Tan and DBS's Irvin Seah said that such a scenario carries only a low risk at this point, and they still expect the central bank to stand pat with its policy come April.\n\nAdded Mr Chew of Barclays: \"Barring unexpected significant shocks to growth and inflation, I think we're in the right stance in the medium term. Even if inflation does pick up, as we expect, I think MAS will not want to overreact to overcompensate for (an increase in) inflation. Some of it is structural and needs to happen for there to be a more efficient allocation of resources.\n\n\"Singapore has been importing a lot of cheap labour for services since 2000, and that needs to change. So some of this inflation is okay and prices will need to reflect that reality.\"\n\nGoing forward, economists expect the Singapore dollar to strengthen, albeit selectively.\n\nSaid Mr Tan of UOB: \"Generally, we'll still see our currency getting stronger against regional currencies - but not against the renminbi since that has been appreciating quite a bit. Also, when QE tapering happens eventually, we'll see strength back in the US dollar as well.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is because the Republic is more of an international hub than Hong Kong, which is more China-focused.\n\nHong Kong-based Alastair MacAulay, who specialises in maritime and offshore financing, including LNG transportation, said that with the Singapore LNG terminal up and running there is also good potential for the Singapore hub in the mid term to tranship spot liquefied natural gas volumes to meet growing North Asian gas demand, as well as help top up any available capacity at regional LNG terminals in-between their receipt of contracted bigger volumes.\n\nHis comments follow those by a senior Shell Gas executive who recently said that the gas boom is seeing global LNG gas demand growth shifting to China and South-east Asia in the coming decade. And within South-east Asia, there will be ample opportunities as the Asean LNG market grows to more than 50 million tonnes per annum by 2025.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Companies & Markets\n\nZuckerberg says Meta will invest hundreds of billions in superintelligence\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:48 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLinkedIn settles antitrust lawsuit, agrees to contracting changes\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:12 PM\n\nUS: Wall Street opens mixed as investors digest fresh tariff threats\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:43 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nBRC Asia secures contracts for Changi Airport Terminal 5 project worth S$570 million\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:04 PM", "images": []}

In August, former Novena Holdings CEO Toh Soon Huat led a group of 17 investors to pump $15 million into the company through a share placement.\n\nMr Toh said the reverse takeover \"will transform Jubilee into a developer with a foothold in one of the most exciting development zones in Malaysia, backed by a highly experienced management team\".\n\nJubilee said it had signed a conditional non-binding memorandum of understanding with Jewelstone Properties to acquire its wholly owned subsidiary, Tenderside Ventures Ltd, for RM150 million.\n\nTenderside owns a 60 per cent stake in Viridea Lakeside Sdn Bhd. Viridea has a contract to acquire development project Viridea @ Medini Lakeside in Johor. The project is a mixed development comprising serviced apartments, retail units and Soho (small office home office) apartments.\n\nIt is a short drive from the Second Link connecting Johor to Singapore, Jubilee said. Viridea will be developing six plots of land, or over 8.2 acres (3.3 hectares), which is expected to yield a combined gross floor area of 1.07 million square feet.\n\nThe estimated gross development value is RM800 million. The project is expected to generate a profit of RM300 million, of which RM180 million is guaranteed to Jubilee.\n\nJewelstone will be controlled by Singapore businessman Dennis Ng, Jubilee said. Jewelstone will make up any shortfall of the profit guarantee in cash. To acquire Tenderside, Jubilee will issue Jewelstone 272.7 million new shares at 22 cents each. These consideration shares represent about 53.7 per cent of Jubilee's enlarged share capital of approximately 507.4 million shares.\n\nMr Ng runs King George Financial Corporation and is a director of Allied Hotel Properties, both real estate companies listed on Canada's TSX Venture Exchange. He is the son of Ng Eng Tee, deputy chairman and executive director of developer United Malayan Land.\n\nJubilee was hit in 2010 by a bribery scandal that resulted in the loss of business from tech giant Apple, its major customer then.\n\nThe company has been on a trading halt since last Friday. It last traded at 22 cents. Trading resumes today.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With the new plant's opening, Koh Brothers now has about 9.6 ha of land area dedicated to precast production.\n\nThe bulk of the prefab materials produced by Koh Brothers is used for HDB projects.\n\nAs output increases and given the new plant's location, Mr Koh hopes to also serve developers working on Iskandar projects as well as private developers in future.\n\nShares in Koh Brothers closed unchanged yesterday at 29.5 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And now they are seeking to challenge foreign competitors outside the mainland.\n\nSo far they have been encroaching on Western art traders' turf in Hong Kong, the former British colony turned semi-autonomous Chinese city. They held their most ambitious sales in Hong Kong so far last week, timed to capture an influx of well-heeled Chinese during a week-long national holiday.\n\nStill, Sotheby's, which is marking its 40th year in Asia, managed to hold on to the lion's share of the market - and the headlines - with some exceptional items.\n\nA white diamond sold for US$30 million, breaking a world record; a Zeng Fanzhi painting that went for US$23 million set a new record for a contemporary Chinese artist; and a gilt bronze Sakyamuni Buddha did the same for Chinese statues, selling at US$30 million.\n\nThe figures represent regained momentum for the Chinese art market after an unexpected contraction last year, when New York reclaimed its place from Beijing as the world's lead city for art sales.\n\nChina still led global arts and collectibles auction revenue last year, according to the French Conseil des Ventes Volontaires.\n\nAuction houses have been ramping up their pursuit of China's burgeoning millionaire class.\n\n\"Their first priority is to gain direct access to the wealth of the mainland Chinese, much of which wealth is contained within the borders of the country,\" said Nancy Murphy, a lawyer and specialist on the Chinese art market.\n\n\"Right now, the vast majority of Chinese art money is chasing only Chinese art; Western art dealers are very, very interested in working to expand that demand, and bringing more Western art physically into China is an excellent first step.\"\n\nLondon-based Spink and Son, which was founded in 1666, recently moved its president to Hong Kong so as to \"further galvanise Spink's thriving Asia business\", the company said in a statement.\n\nAfter years of waiting, in late September Christie's held its first auction in mainland China in the commercial hub Shanghai. Sotheby's will hold its second in December in Beijing, with a feature piece from French-Chinese artist Zao Wou-Ki, who died in April.\n\nBut Meg Maggio, an American gallery owner with 20 years' experience in China, believes Western firms will not flourish on the mainland - and at best they might attract more buyers to New York, London and Paris.\n\n\"They have to come because what else can they do? They've basically lost their dominance in Hong Kong,\" she said. \"I think their growth will be minimal.\"\n\nShe said the art market is \"primarily\" older items - where Chinese law gives domestic companies a huge advantage.\n\nThey also benefit from important political connections.\n\nPoly Auction, the third largest house in the world, belongs to a state-owned conglomerate controlled by the army and headed by the son-in-law of China's former leader Deng Xiaoping.\n\nChen Dongsheng, co-founder of Guardian, the world's fifth largest auction firm, is married to the granddaughter of the late leader Mao Zedong.\n\nIt is unclear if Beijing will ever lift the prohibitions on foreign auction houses, although Ms Murphy expects they will gradually ease, allowing healthier competition.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese firms trying to make inroads outside their country may enjoy swifter success. With a huge publicity drive they have sought to convince Western collectors to buy and sell through them, and Poly has opened an office in New York.\n\n\"China is definitely in buying mode,\" Ms Maggio said. \"The Europeans and other people are more in the selling mode.\" AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

A total of 42.1 per cent of the employed NSmen who participated in the survey said they either \"slightly agreed\", \"agreed\" or \"strongly agreed\", when asked if they believed that their employers preferred to hire employees without NS commitments.\n\nThese results suggest that a significant proportion of NSmen believe that employers are prejudiced against their NS commitments, which may keep them away from work periodically. The validity of this perception can probably only be ascertained anecdotally, but as the saying goes, there is no smoke without fire. If there are employers out there who indeed feel this way about hiring personnel with NS commitments, then something must be done to correct this attitude. NS is not only a key pillar of Singapore's \"total defence\" strategy, it also provides an integral platform for social cohesion and nation-building as well as character-building.

The Last Ship is a collection of songs from his forthcoming autobiographical Broadway musical of the same name, set to open next year. The traditional folk pop arrangements make for easy listening but they would probably work better on stage than just listening to it on CD. It's a bold change of musical direction that might surprise some expecting the old Sting but thankfully there are still traces of his pop sensibility in the slow-burning grooves of And Yet and It's Not The Same Moon.\n\nRating:\n\nB-\n\nEarth, Wind & Fire\n\nNow, Then & Forever\n\nListening to Earth, Wind & Fire's latest album Now, Then & Forever is like stepping back in time to the 1970s. From the funky swagger of the opening track Sign On to sensual ballads like Love Is Law and Guiding Lights, which singer-songwriter Phillip Bailey delivers in his signature falsetto, this is classic disco which will cure anybody suffering from dancefloor blues. Fans of recent works by Daft Punk, Robin Thicke and Justin Timberlake might also want to check this out to hear where the original musical blueprint originated from.\n\nRating:\n\nB\n\nElton John\n\nThe Diving Board\n\nElton John goes back to basics on The Diving Board, the 31st studio album of his career. He's joined once again by his long-time lyricist Bernie Taupin and the arrangement is kept to the bare minimum with just piano, bass and drums being used for the tracks. It's classic Elton John - full of stomping boogie-woogie keyboard melodies on songs like Mexican Vacation, the lead single off the album, and The Ballad of Blind Tom. Producer T-Bone Burnett's keeps things intimate but also leaves enough room for darker ballads like My Quicksand and Voyeur room to simmer and brood without sticking out like sore thumbs amongst the other more upbeat songs.\n\nRating:\n\nB+\n\nGloria Estefan\n\nThe Standards\n\nEx-Miami Sound Machine frontwoman Gloria Estefan turns to the Great American Songbook for her latest album, The Standards. The familiarity of the tunes - from George and Ira Gershwin's They Can't Take That Away From Me and Embraceable You to Antonio Carlos Jobim's Eu Sei Que Vou Te Amar - makes this a safe bet compared to releasing a CD of original tunes but it's also a little unimaginative and unadventurous given how many pop stars do it nowadays as a stop-gap release. But having said that, Estefan delivers the songs with class and The Standards is every bit the crowd-pleaser it sets out to be.\n\nRating:\n\nC+\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The fact that a small group of radical Republican lawmakers can engineer an operational shutdown of most of the US federal government for a few days is unpleasant enough for thousands of government workers and millions of Americans who depend on public services.\n\nBut when those lawmakers also threaten to prevent the US debt ceiling from being raised - which must be done before Oct 17 - it is a potential threat to not only the US but also the global economy, and has set off alarm bells as far away as Beijing and Tokyo. If the legal limit on how much the US government can borrow is not increased within a week, Washington will not have enough cash to meet its liabilities. The potential consequences of this could be apocalyptic. In particular, there would be doubts over whether the US would be able to make interest payments on its Treasury bills - which are supposed to be the world's safest financial instruments. This explains why China and Japan (the largest holders of Treasuries) are concerned. The wider market consequences of a US default could include, among various things, a sharp hike in US interest rates - which would tip the American economy back into recession and take the global economy down with it, and cause major shocks to financial markets around the world.\n\nEconomists caution that it would be complacent to argue that a technical default by the US government - reflecting a temporary, legally created inability to pay rather than an unwillingness to pay - would be no big deal; a default lasting even a few days would cause severe market damage.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Columns\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM", "images": []}

These cold, hard figures are necessary to do business with life.\n\nThey can be classified under two broad categories which, imagined as gigantic billboards, read \"SPEND\" and \"EARN\". \"Spend\" is far more complicated than \"earn\".\n\nA place of one's own in Singapore, for example, might cost up to $1 million if you're looking at a condominium apartment, and half that if you're married and looking to buy new public housing.\n\nThen, there are other nitty-gritty details, generalised very grossly as: rent or mortgage payments, eating out, groceries and bills, transport, a domestic helper, clothes and shoes for women, gadgets and other toys for men, tuition for kids, healthcare, upkeep for parents, the occasional holiday abroad.\n\nUnder \"earn\", most people will have only a single item: their monthly pay cheque.\n\nThat's a huge inequality right there. We don't even need to get into the income gap. And so many people feel they do not have control over their finances.\n\nThere is only one number contributing to the credit column of their bank account at the end of every month. By contrast, there is a seemingly infinite list of debits.\n\nFor the working young, the picture gets grimmer given low interest rates and longer lifespans. Do you really want to work every year, month, day, and endure the daily MRT crush, for the next 30 or 40 years until you hit 65? And even after all that, will you have enough saved to survive the next 30 years of retirement, given that you can live well into your 80s and even 90s on current life expectancy trends?\n\nThe number-crunching can get overwhelming and people reach for their financial adviser or insurance agent.\n\nBut sometimes, the details don't matter so much when it comes to deciding how to spend and earn.\n\nOne gauge people focus on is what their peers are doing. This phenomenon, known as \"keeping up with the Joneses\", refers to the powerful influence of people's spending decisions on their neighbours, colleagues and friends.\n\nIf most people around you are dirt poor, like Singapore in the 1960s and 1970s, you'd be happy watching some monochrome TV for entertainment at the end of a long hard day at work.\n\nDuring the weekend, a movie is a treat. There is not much keeping up to do.\n\nToday, society is far richer and more diverse. More than ever, people are also bombarded by a torrent of information on how other people around them lead their lives. Facebook is an effective way to show off your latest gourmet restaurant meal or that deluxe holiday to Bhutan.\n\nThe public sharing of these experiences tread the fine line between conspicuous consumption and the edge of cool - enough to elicit admiring nods and \"likes\" of approval from your friends, but perhaps make them a little envious. The race to get ahead does not just cover the \"spend\" category. Right from graduation, some people will dominate the \"earn\" rankings, making six figures a year straight out of school, getting 12-month or 24-month bonuses, and so on. What's a young and reasonably competitive person to do?\n\nGiven the inevitable benchmarking against one's peers, a certain strength of mind and perspective is needed.\n\nStrength of mind is needed to catch up, if income equality is all you are after. After all, if you cannot make as much as your friends, then work on saving more.\n\nThere are many items in the \"spend\" category, but just one in \"earn\".\n\nFor those with tiring day jobs, it can be easier to cut costs than to figure out how to earn more money. Once even a few thousand dollars are saved, investing that can bring a few hundred dollars of dividends to add to the \"earn\" category every year. Part-time jobs can bring more.\n\nA high savings rate, even on a below-average wage, goes a long way. Earn $2,500 a month but save half of that, and you'll hit $90,000 by the end of six years without having to invest a cent.\n\nWithout saving, even the above-average earners fall short. Bloomberg recently featured a 77-year-old former vice-president of marketing for multinational oral hygiene firm Oral-B, who earned the low six figures at the height of his career. But he managed to save only US$90,000 by 2008, before the financial crisis gave his investments a beating.\n\nThe will to cut down on costs is one thing. Getting some perspective is another. Singapore's median income last year was $3,000 a month.\n\nAbout a third of locals earn under $2,000. Many don't have the luxury of planning for retirement, but will have to depend on their children or the state.\n\nOther than empathising with the less fortunate, the other way to gain perspective is to look ahead.\n\nIf you're really going to live into your 90s, the wealth accumulation game is a marathon, not a sprint.\n\nThere is no telling what will befall the world in between. But there will always be opportunity.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

It expects the gain from the disposal to be about $2.3 million. Proceeds would be used for working capital, as well as investment and acquisition opportunities.\n\nThe property, on leasehold land owned by JTC, has an estimated land area of 6,931.2 sq m. It was leased by ICP's wholly owned subsidiary Valtron Technology Pte Ltd in 1994 for a period of 30 years at a cost of $4.25 million.\n\nFor the financial year ended June 30, 2013, the net book value of the property stood at $9.5 million.\n\nThe sale of the property is expected to be completed within three months upon receiving JTC's approval.\n\nThe group, formerly known as Goldtron Ltd, had requested a trading halt on the Singapore Exchange on Oct 3. Its counter last traded at 0.3 cents. Yesterday evening, the group requested its trading halt to be lifted with effect from this morning.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And in a civilised way, one might add.\n\nAt the close of the 38th Assembly of the United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) last week, an agreement was reached committing the organisation, which regulates and oversees global aviation, to develop a global market-based measure (MBM) which would help the industry achieve carbon-neutral growth from 2020 (CNG2020). A global MBM will also complement progress on improving technology, operations and infrastructure in the industry's long-established four-pillar strategy to manage aviation's climate change impact.\n\nNot surprisingly, the International Air Transport Association (Iata) was quick to welcome the deal hammered out to tackle the hot button issue of Climate Change. And as its director-general Tony Tyler noted, reaching this agreement among ICAO's 191 member states was a challenging task.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Columns\n\nEroding US exceptionalism will impact world economy\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nBye-bye America First?\n\nJul 15, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week", "images": []}

Advertisers that try to cut corners by commissioning one video for both online and offline media are the most likely to fall into this trap.\n\nThe concept of \"lean back\" consumption is not just used in the advertising world. The computing industry has adopted the term to describe the difference between interacting on tablets compared with PCs, and publishers are taking it into consideration when putting out different versions of their products for paper, tablet, PC and mobile.\n\nFor video, said Mr Gulati, advertisers are not going to be able to force feed commercials to viewers online, as they have been accustomed to on TV. \"You see about 40 TV ads in an hour, with the average 22-minute portion of an hour of TV being given to ads. You won't see 40 ads in an hour when you're surfing, though,\" he said.\n\nFurthermore, the TV commercial format is fairly antiquated and does not translate well online. \"Typically, you start by demonstrating a problem, then you show the product and how it works. That format's been around for decades.\"\n\nA viewer watching this online is more likely to just hit the skip button. \"The challenge is to make the ad desirable in the first five seconds before the skip button appears. So, you need to think about content, storytelling, and how the ad sits within the website,\" Mr Gulati says.\n\nThese observations combine with a important statistic - a whopping 80 per cent of consumers in Singapore watch videos online, he said. \"You can't ignore the online channel, even for traditional companies. You can't push all of your money onto the online medium, because TV still has the highest penetration. But you must start investing where the impact is growing.\"\n\nThe tech industry has recognised the rapid migration of eyeballs over to the online world in recent years. Apple has been quietly building new features and content into its Apple TV service, as it prepares to challenge other technology players and broadcasters.\n\nThis year, it added two major content sources in the form of HBO Go and WatchESPN to its roster, and partnered with online sites such as Crunchyroll, to add content to Apple TV. It said in June that users now purchase over 800,000 TV shows per day via iTunes.\n\nRival firm Microsoft has also made video a core feature of its upcoming next-generation Xbox One console, opening the door to video-based advertising on its system.\n\nNearer home, Chinese search giant Baidu in May purchased PPS, an online video site, for US$370 million. At last count, iQiyi had a 200 million monthly mobile viewership.\n\nFellow Chinese giant Alibaba has plans for a smart TV set-top box, which will work with smartphones to allow people to surf and shop on their TVs. Users will also be able to take their video content on the road, streamed to their mobile phones. Again, this opens a clear window for commercials to be fed to users, cutting out TV broadcasters altogether.\n\nThe move away from the traditional TV is key, especially in Asia. According to comScore estimates in August 2012, Chinese viewers watched 4.1 billion hours of Web video in the month alone.\n\nMr Gulati pointed out that the mobile format should be treated differently from laptops and tablets. \"Mobile screens have lower brand recall compared with TVs or PCs, because of the smaller screen size.\"\n\nAdvertisers should consider other modes of making mobile video more interactive, in order to have the message \"stick\", he suggested.

This is the first time that the RPI has fallen since the first quarter of 2009, at the outset of the global financial crisis, when it lost 0.8 per cent.\n\nConsultants were not surprised by the drop, as a combination of cooling measures, and new or tweaked government regulations over the year took their toll.\n\n\"The decline was to happen sooner or later,\" said Eugene Lim, key executive officer at ERA Realty, as the resale market continues to show signs of stabilising.\n\nSaid Nicholas Mak, executive director for research and consultancy at SLP International: \"This contraction is partly contributed by the government's efforts to cool the public housing market, which resulted in the decline of ... cash-over-valuation (COV) in recent transactions, especially for larger HDB flats.\"\n\nThe COV cash premium took a hard dive in the third quarter, figures from estate agencies show. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, ERA said overall median COVs fell 33.3 per cent to $18,000, with the biggest absolute falls in terms of quantum coming from executive flats.\n\nThe $18,000 figure overall tallies with PropNex Realty's data, which noted this was a 40 per cent drop from the $32,000 median COV at the start of the year.\n\nResale volumes did not fare any better. ERA data showed that the number of transactions fell 36.7 per cent quarter-on-quarter to 3,193 units in Q3, with the largest decline of 41.9 per cent coming from the executive flat segment.\n\nDemand in Q3 was hit by factors such as a tighter Mortgage Servicing Ratio (MSR) on HDB housing loans and a Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) framework introduced in June.\n\n\"Due to a cut off in access to large loans and hence 'easy money', there are very few buyers looking at investing in large or well-located flats,\" said Ong Kah Seng, director at R'ST Research.\n\nA recently-introduced three-year wait for new Permanent Residents (PRs) before they can buy a resale flat and the loosening of regulations for singles to buy BTO flats has also diverted demand away from the secondary market.\n\nOn the supply side, the pipeline remains ample, with HDB on track to launch 25,000 Build-to-Order (BTO) flats this year. Next month, it will offer close to 8,000 units under BTO and Sale of Balance Flats exercises.\n\nMohd Ismail, CEO of PropNex Realty, said the abundant supply may have created a \"re-balancing effect\" in the resale market, gradually softening price growth to a more sustainable level.\n\nSellers are now also less willing to cash out without a sufficiently attractive offer, as they may not have enough to buy another flat with similar attributes due to the tighter MSR terms, said ERA's Mr Lim.\n\nHe expects resale transactions to hit a historical low at below 20,000 units this year, and that COVs will fall to around $10,000 by the end of the year.\n\n\"With lower COVs, lower resale transaction prices are expected. As we see more lower priced transactions, flat valuations will also come down.\"\n\nAnalysts generally did not see price trends picking up in Q4, as sales are traditionally slower over the festive period, and as new property measures introduced in late August work their way through.\n\nFor the year, resale flat price growth could be anywhere from minus 1 per cent to 2 per cent, they predicted. PropNex's Mr Ismail believes resale prices could fall as much as 3 to 5 per cent next year.\n\nR'ST's Mr Ong feels buying interest could pick up in the second half of 2014, when an \"equilibrium point\" is reached where prices and COVs come down to the point of being more affordable.\n\n\"Even (if) demand stabilises or slightly recovers from H2 2014, sellers cannot easily raise prices, since the MSR cap essentially restricts buyers from borrowing excessively to finance the flat,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Top-of-the-line Tom Dixon lamps, wood and iron bar stools from Arteriors and Aviator Tomcat chairs inspired by World War II fighter aircraft keep it all to theme.\n\nTo keep it all very 2013, an award-winning mixologist will be roped in to create molecular cocktails in \"flamboyant flavours influenced by cultures around the world,\" adds Ms Fenley. Five new cocktail creations will be introduced each month, starting with a selection of Singapore-inspired tipple for the opening month, such as white wine sangria tinged with chrysanthemum and lychee. If you're feeling peckish, simple bar snacks such as beef and salmon carpaccio, cold cuts and gourmet hot dogs will be on hand - and remember to keep your nonchalant cool should your cocktail be served with a moustache attached to its straw.\n\n\"We're going to be fun, playful and creative - we want people to take a photo of their drinks and enjoy it aesthetically as well as in taste,\" says Ms Fenley. \"Instead of being just a bar that serves drinks, we hope to provide an entire lifestyle experience.\"\n\nA Singapore PR of Thai-Chinese and British-Spanish descent, Ms Fenley left her marketing job earlier this year to serve as the team's creative director. Mr MacGregor, meanwhile, is a Scotsman who has lived in Singapore for eight years. His family owns a private investment company with interests in the oil and gas, property and technology fields.\n\nThe bar will be managed by Jamie Lee Gibb, a Scotsman and long-time friend of Mr MacGregor's who has previously run top clubs in the United Kingdom such as Mal Maisons and Dizzy.\n\nThe couple plan to open a second bar by the middle of next year, says Mr MacGregor, \"and we'll keep the luxury element for sure\".\n\nBut though upscale, House of Dandy, which cost $500,000 to set up, will not be an exclusive members' bar. Nor will it be one that admits only men - as gentlemen's clubs of the day used to do.\n\n\"After all, you can't have hedonism if there's only one gender around,\" quips Ms Fenley with a grin.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But Democrats view that approach as hostage-taking and say Congress must reopen the government and authorise additional borrowing before serious negotiations can occur.\n\nThe partial government shutdown has furloughed 800,000 federal workers and appears likely to remain for an extended period of time. The next crucial deadline comes on Oct 17, the last day the Treasury Department estimates that the federal government is certain to have enough money to pay all its bills.\n\nInvestors have also been demanding higher interest rates for US Treasury bills in recent days, a sign of concern that the federal government could have trouble servicing its debt.\n\nOn Wednesday, there was growing realisation on both sides of the aisle that lawmakers will likely have to deal with resolving the debt ceiling issue at the same time as the government shutdown.\n\nStill, Mr Obama and Senate Democrats have so far refused to negotiate over either issue, saying they have already agreed to locking in lower funding levels favoured by the Republicans and that paying the nation's bills - which raising the debt ceiling would do - is non-negotiable.\n\nThe government shutdown is beginning to hit the factory floor, with major manufacturers like Boeing and United Technologies warning of delays and employee furloughs in the thousands if the impasse persists. - WP, Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

The reluctance of Singaporeans to take up overseas postings would constrain not only their own career progress in multinational corporations but also Singapore's potential in the world, he added.\n\nThe PM's exhortation might seem remarkable. Globally savvy, most Singaporeans can, of course, see that an overseas work or study stint would be invaluable for the exposure to a different culture, the tremendous learning and mind-broadening experience that it provides. But family issues - young children's education, spouse's career, care of elderly parents - typically stand in the way. To be sure, a good number of Singaporeans have ventured out, even beyond the usual destinations to far- flung corners of the globe, but the intrepid and spunky are still the exceptions by far. Employers find it a challenge to get suitably skilled and qualified Singaporeans to take up an overseas assignment for even a year or two. Yet for those who aspire to top posts in an MNC, an overseas stint, \"even to difficult places\", would be almost de rigueur. Said PM Lee: \"We should have that spark to go wherever the opportunities are, and some of them will be hardship postings.\"\n\nContrast the situation elsewhere: many young French people, for instance, see greater opportunities outside their country, particularly in Asia, and France is worried about an exodus of talent. Indeed, with high youth unemployment across the continent, droves of young people from Greece, Spain, Italy, etc, have had to leave home in search of not so much greener pastures but simply a decent job and salary.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nEroding US exceptionalism will impact world economy\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nBye-bye America First?\n\nJul 15, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

It was also deemed to be the ideal choice because it is very well served by quality institutions and higher education establishments, and because it has world-class infrastructural links and a well-established and widely respected R&D strategy,\" said Matthieu de Tugny, BV's vice-president for marine & offshore for South Asia.\n\nBV said more than $7 million will be invested over five years in up to 10 R&D projects and it is in discussion with local stakeholders on possible collaborations.\n\n\"MPA is happy to support BV in the set-up of its Deepwater Technology Research Centre in Singapore. Since the expansion of the MCF scheme, this is the second R&D test centre to open in Singapore. We are encouraged by the positive response and we encourage interested companies to come forward with their proposals. The set-up of R&D and Test Centres will develop Singapore's capabilities in the field of maritime R&D and technology,\" said MPA chief executive Lam Yi Young.\n\nThe centre will provide a platform for the technologically innovative resolution of issues by highly skilled personnel.\n\nUsing BV's state-of-the-art software tools, the DTRC will be conducting applied research in the key R&D areas of hydrodynamics, hydro-structures, mooring and riser systems, computational fluid dynamics and renewable energy.\n\nIt will be headed by BV's research engineer Xiaobo Chen, who has been with the company since 1991 and was previously head of BV's hydrodynamic and mooring section and director of international R&D cooperation.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

United Continental Holdings, which has teamed up with ANA, is seeking its first slot on its own while Delta Air Lines, the only major US carrier without a Japanese partner, wants 25 slot pairs. American Airlines has a partnership with JAL.\n\nANA, Japan's largest airline, is vying for a lion's share of the roughly 20 new international slots to be distributed among local carriers, saying government support of JAL's restructuring tipped the balance in favour of its rival.

They assigned a \"negative\" rating to the Hong Kong property sector and said that office prices will drop 20 per cent.\n\nBarclays' forecast exceeds the predictions of a series of brokerages that have downgraded Hong Kong property this month and implies the biggest plunge in prices since 1998. Hong Kong home prices more than doubled since the start of 2009 on record-low interest rates and lack of supply, prompting the government to impose extra taxes and tighten lending restrictions.\n\n\"The magnitude of the fall is underestimated,\" the Barclays analysts wrote.\n\nThe analysts are advising investors to sell eight of the 14 Hong Kong property companies it covers, including Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd, the city's second-biggest builder, Swire Properties Ltd, New World Development Ltd and Wharf Holdings Ltd.\n\nCheung Kong Holdings Ltd, controlled by Li Ka-shing, Asia's richest man, and Hang Lung Properties Ltd, which made more than 50 per cent of its revenue outside Hong Kong in the first half, are the only two property stocks Barclays recommends investors to buy.\n\nThe Hang Seng Property Index, which tracks nine of the biggest developers listed in the city, including Sun Hung Kai and Cheung Kong, has declined about 14 per cent since peaking in January.\n\nDevelopers in the first half sold 4,300 residential units, the fewest since the second half of 2008, after the government in February doubled stamp duty taxes on property transactions over HK$2 million (S$320,000).\n\nTo make up for the first half's slowing sales, developers will need to cut prices to attract buyers, said the Barclays analysts.\n\nPrices will come under pressure as household incomes and residential rents peak, while housing supply is set to increase, the analysts said. Hong Kong's average household income was little changed in the second quarter, while rents are \"starting to hit the income ceiling\", they said.\n\nChief Executive Leung Chun Ying, who has pledged to increase land supply since coming to office in July 2012, said in January that the private sector may sell 67,000 homes in the next three to four years. Hong Kong developers completed 48,936 homes from 2008 to 2013, the lowest in any five-year period since data became available in 1985.\n\nHong Kong home prices last year surpassed a previous peak in 1997 and are now the world's highest, according to realtor Savills plc, after having more than doubled since 2009. They have fallen about 2.7 per cent since rising to a record in March, according to an index compiled by Centaline Property Agency Ltd.\n\nRaymond Ngai of Bank of America's Merrill Lynch unit and UBS's Eva Lee are among analysts who over the past month have forecast home prices in the city will drop as much as 25 per cent as demand wanes because of government curbs and the expectation of rising interest rates. Since 2010, Hong Kong has introduced a raft of measures, including extra property transaction taxes and tighter mortgage-lending requirements, to damp prices and avert a housing bubble. Total residential transactions in the first half fell to the lowest since 1996, according to data available on the Land Registry's website.\n\nHong Kong's real estate market may also face pressure as the US Federal Reserve prepares to trim stimulus, according to the Merrill Lynch and UBS analysts. Mortgage costs in the city tend to track interest rates in the US because the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US currency.- Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM", "images": []}

This was the conclusion of the 650-plus union activists at the biennial National Trades Union Congress' (NTUC) Ordinary Delegates' Conference which ended yesterday.\n\n\"There's no running from the progressive wage model, there's no running away from reaching out to the PMEs,\" Mr Lim told reporters after the conference yesterday.\n\nDelegates at the three-day pow-wow reaffirmed that the PWM and PMEs are \"strategic\" and in the long-term interest of workers.\n\nThe PWM reflects NTUC's plan to help workers of different sectors achieve sustainable wage increases \"through the tailoring of wage ladders unique to each job sector\". It aims to enable workers at all levels to upgrade and progress to the next wage point under a progressive wage model.\n\nWhile the PWM has been rolled out, delegates felt that the training support needed still had not been formally put in place, according to Mr Lim, who is NTUC secretary-general and also Minister in the Prime Minister's Office. They reckoned that the training has to be structured and widespread.\n\nThe same holds true for the national push for higher productivity growth, the delegates said.\n\nThey also called on NTUC to beef up its service to PMEs as more join the labour movement. But they also cautioned against neglecting rank-and-file members who remain the backbone of the labour movement.\n\nWith membership hitting 800,000 this year, the labour movement is within sight of reaching its goal of one million members by 2015. Along with the push for the PWM and to reach out to more PMEs, as well as to extend tripartism to the ground level, the conference recognised the need to build and develop a strong core of labour leaders, said Mr Lim.\n\nAs NTUC moves to grow and develop its current pool of 6,200 union leaders, Mr Lim said that there was a need to take a \"whole of labour movement\" approach. This means that leaders will be identified and nurtured at all three levels in the labour movement - the national or NTUC, sectoral and union level.\n\nA \"development circuit\" will be set up to groom labour leaders \"in a systematic manner with a slew of initiatives, such as training programmes, mentoring schemes and opportunities to learn and contribute to assignments\", he revealed.\n\nDelegates at the conference also urged the labour movement to step up its engagement with the management and human resource community to speed up the implementation of the PWM and reach out to PMEs.\n\nThey also suggested that the labour movement broaden its engagement with relevant government agencies \"so that there is mutual understanding and closer collaboration between both parties in making both our economy and workers future-ready\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The dangers from within, for instance, include IT administrators who have unfettered access to the network. They then turn rogue and release sensitive information.\n\nHe cited Edward Snowden, the NSA (National Security Agency) whistleblower who released sensitive information regarding the US government's supposed monitoring of citizens' communications, as an example of an insider threat.\n\nThis is why the MAS has internal regulations that implement the \"never alone\" principle, in which no system administrator can have the singular ability to create master passwords or backup data, Mr Chew said.\n\nAnother MAS policy is the segregation of responsibilities between IT administrators involved in day-to-day operations and those in charge of data backup and recovery functions, he added.\n\nBesides implementing policy, Mr Bargar also called on organisations to build up their overall resiliency when an online attack takes place. The ability to suffer an attack, yet recover quickly to a trusted environment, means minimal downtime while allowing them to investigate the attackers and hit back, he explained.\n\nMr Bargar added that having \"active defence\" architecture also involves expanding internal intelligence gathering and developing an early warning system. Citing a study by the Ponemon Institute, he said the lack of real-time cyber threat intelligence cost each enterprise an average of US$10 million over a 12-month period.\n\nTo have a resilient active defence strategy, companies need to map out the cascading impact of potential security breaches from a single point of vulnerability. This is so that they know where their \"crown jewels\" are and how to safeguard them in a proactive manner, he advised.\n\nGetting employees onboard is also critical in raising the overall security readiness of organisations, Mr Bargar pointed out. One way is to offer staff real-time training and simulation to actual attacks in order to increase awareness and preparedness.\n\n\"Companies can organise cyber war games and have blue and red teams battle it out to test out the robustness of their systems, and root out any potential vulnerabilities,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

American exchanges have implemented a limit-up/limit-down initiative that prevents market makers from quoting shares at prices deemed too far above or below current levels.\n\n\"It's more important now because today there's so much electronic trading,\" Seth Merrin, founder and CEO of New York- based Liquidnet, operator of trading platforms for mutual funds and asset managers, said in an Oct 7 interview in Singapore. \"That's how a stock can go down from US$40 to a penny. I'm 100 per cent in favour of circuit breakers.\"\n\nRegulators around the world have stepped up oversight of capital markets after the global financial crisis in 2008. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) established a 13- member council in 2010 with the goal of boosting corporate governance standards and investor confidence.\n\nWhile existing rules in Singapore are sufficient for company disclosures, regulators may need to introduce an \"early warning\" system for investors, said David Gerald, president of SIAS, the largest organised investor lobby group in Asia.\n\n\"SIAS calls on SGX to implement the circuit-breaker mechanism immediately to help prevent wild fluctuations of stock prices to enable investors to digest the information available in the marketplace during the break and make informed decisions,\" he said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe exchange said on Oct 6 that shares of the three companies have been declared designated securities, prohibiting investors from selling them unless they hold the same quantity of stock. Buyers must make cash payments for the transactions, it added. Carolyn Lim, a spokeswoman for the bourse, didn't immediately comment on the call for circuit breakers on Tuesday and couldn't be reached in her office yesterday.\n\nBlumont, which invests in minerals and energy, slumped 94 per cent over two trading days on Oct 4 and Oct 7, before closing unchanged on Tuesday. That shaved S$4.9 billion off its market value, prompting the company to scrap a proposed S$146 million acquisition of Australia's Cokal Ltd.\n\nThe stock rebounded earlier on Tuesday, more than doubling after Alexander Molyneux, former CEO of SouthGobi Resources Ltd, invested in the company. He will buy 135 million Blumont shares and become chairman after the purchase is completed, the company said. Mr Molyneux, who was ousted as CEO of SouthGobi last September, is a director of Ivanhoe Energy Inc. Blumont climbed as much as 58 per cent yesterday before closing the day 46 per cent up at 19 Singapore cents.\n\n\"It's not for us to comment on the restrictions,\" Mr Molyneux said at a press conference in Singapore on Tuesday. \"The exchange does their job, they have their rules, and we do our job. Whether or not any regulatory issues caused the share-price slide, I believe it created a unique value opportunity and that's why I bought the stock.\"\n\nKelly Teoh, a strategist at IG Markets in Singapore, said last week that short-sellers are taking advantage of the \"weak market sentiment\". She said on Tuesday that Mr Molyneux's investment in Blumont should stem further selling in the stock.\n\nBefore the selloff, Blumont was the best performer on Singapore's broader FTSE ST All-Share Index after a more than 12-fold increase in the first nine months of the year.\n\nAsiasons, which last month bought a stake in US oil-and-gas producer Black Elk Energy Offshore Operations LLC, tumbled 96 per cent over three trading days through Tuesday, shaving S$2.5 billion in market value.\n\nThe stock, which was the second-best performer on the FTSE ST All-Share Index, more than tripled in the nine months through September. The company said on Oct 4 that rumours that it was being investigated by regulators were false. The shares climbed 38 per cent to 16 Singapore cents yesterday.\n\nLionGold, which said this week that it was in advanced negotiations for a possible acquisition of Minera IRL Ltd (a gold explorer in Peru, Argentina and Chile), plunged 87 per cent over the three-day period, wiping off S$1.2 billion in market value. The shares climbed 42 per cent in the first nine months of the year. They fell 0.5 per cent yesterday to 18.9 Singapore cents.\n\nThe swings in the prices of these companies are \"worrisome signs\" that should be investigated, said Jim Rogers, chairman of Singapore-based Rogers Holdings. Still, he's against the introduction of circuit breakers.\n\n\"They should let the market take care of itself,\" he said in a phone interview on Oct 7. \"Circuit breakers are absurd. It's just another interference for the market.\"\n\nCircuit breakers could also affect investor perception, said Andy Maynard, global head of trading and execution at CLSA Ltd in Hong Kong, adding that Singapore should keep its market open and free.\n\nTrading limits are \"just part and parcel of doing business in those markets where there isn't a concept of a free market in the first place\", he said in an e-mailed response yesterday. \"As long as participants are able to settle and deliver stock, then stocks should rise and fall on their own attributions.\"\n\nStill, the call for circuit breakers comes one month after Everbright Securities Co announced a 523 million yuan (S$106.4 million) loss after US$3.8 billion in erroneous trading orders that roiled China's equity market and drew a record regulatory penalty that banned four of its executives from the market for life.\n\nMarkets including South Korea, India and Taiwan use circuit breakers, while countries including Japan have daily price limits depending on their value, according to CLSA. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nIndonesia looking at levy on coal exports to boost state coffers\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:03 PM\n\nAsia: Markets mixed as China\u2019s economy meets forecasts\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:49 AM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nFCT extends Northpoint City South Wing management by a year\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:28 AM\n\nChina\u2019s quant funds boost US recruiting after Trump\u2019s visa curbs\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nGold holds ground with spotlight on US inflation data\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:51 AM\n\nChina Medical System shares surge 11% with its secondary listing on SGX\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:30 AM", "images": []}

The lack of ready infrastructure projects and slow implementation of public-private partnerships (PPPs) are a real concern to investors,\" said the Abac report.\n\nThe council also encouraged Apec leaders to ensure that their respective economies remain open to cross-border investment and to promote a broad understanding of the benefits of foreign direct investment as a driver of sustainable growth and employment.\n\nSingapore's PM Lee described the Abac dialogue as a \"useful platform to engage business leaders informally on issues that are important to the development of regional economies\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The average passing rent for MIT's properties edged down to $1.70 per square foot (psf) per month from $1.71 psf per month in Q1.\n\nFor the half year ended Sept 30, DPU was 4.9 cents, up 7.7 per cent from a year ago. Distributable income was 9.4 per cent higher at $81.3 million. The trust's gearing stands at 36.2 per cent.\n\nMIT expects rental income to increase from two projects. Its build-to-suit development for Kulicke & Soffa, K&S Corporate Headquarters at Serangoon North Avenue 5, received its temporary occupation permit earlier this month and is 72 per cent pre-committed.

This two-year exercise was completed only last month.\n\nNeil Maxwell, the chief executive of M&L Hospitality, said: \"We have been committed to bringing out the hotel's full potential through investment.\"\n\nMr Kum expects the extensions to the hotel to alleviate a current shortage of hotel rooms and convention space in Sydney's central business district (CBD).\n\nDarling Harbour, located in the CBD, is to be remade into a convention, exhibition and entertainment precinct at an expected cost of A$1 billion.\n\nAustralia is to develop the International Convention Centre (ICC) Sydney, its largest convention and exhibition space, which will be ready by around 2016.\n\nThe Four Points was M&L Hospitality's first Australian hotel investment. Also in the company's Australian portfolio are the Swissotel Sydney, Travelodge Docklands in Melbourne and Citigate Melbourne.\n\nThe company owns another eight hotels in Singapore, London, Japan and New Zealand.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This takes the total number of aircraft under ST Aerospace's Boeing 757-200 PTF conversion programme to 119.\n\nST Aerospace also received a cabin reconfiguration project from an Asia-based airline to work on two Boeing 767-300 aircraft. Separately, it was awarded a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) by the European Aviation Safety Agency for a full cabin retrofit of six Airbus A330 aircraft for an international carrier.\n\nIn Q3, ST Aerospace redelivered a total of 245 aircraft for airframe maintenance and modification works as well as redelivered five Boeing 757-200 converted freighters. Aside from airframe redeliveries, \"the aerospace sector processed 11,360 components, 59 landing gears, 57 engines and conducted 1,570 engine washes for both commercial and military customers\".\n\nST Aerospace is also trying to widen its reach by growing its engine leasing and pilot training sectors. Its wholly owned subsidiary, ST Aerospace Engines, recently ploughed additional capital into Total Engines Asset Management (TEAM), in which it holds a 50 per cent stake. TEAM has placed out 10 engines so far. It has also expanded its leasing portfolio to include the International Aero Engines V2500 engine.\n\nMeanwhile, its commercial pilot training academy has been certified by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) as a Type Rating Training Organisation, enabling the academy to carry out aircraft type conversion training leading to CAAS type ratings.\n\nA fixed-based Airbus A320 FFT X\u2122-MPL simulator has been commissioned at its training academy at Seletar Aerospace Park.

From February 2014, the engines of Cat A cars not only have to be limited in displacement to under 1,600 cc but their power also cannot exceed 97 kW or 130 hp.\n\nBecause of this, some sellers are keen to offload existing stock before the deadline.\n\n\"So even if COE goes up, it is better for them to clear their stocks now before it becomes even more expensive later,\" he said.\n\nAs for the spike in the Cat B COE premium, the sales manager was nonplussed. \"I didn't expect it to jump so much, so I was outbid,\" he confessed, explaining that the Leng Kee Road motor belt was \"quiet\" over the past three weekends.\n\nHe said: \"The second weekend was especially quiet although it was slightly better during the most recent weekend. I don't know who could be bidding for COEs so aggressively.\"\n\nYesterday's rise in the Cat B premium was likely the result of the relatively small gap between it and the Cat A premium after the previous tender, said the director of a luxury brand.\n\n\"It was small, less than $2,500, so interest shifted to Cat B,\" he said. \"It's the usual ding dong story. It should swing back now that the gap has widened.\"\n\nHe said it is unlikely that the sharp rise in Cat B was caused by the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class because launch prices are not firmed up yet.\n\nRather, he believes the most plausible reason is that one of the luxury makes is the sponsor of next February's Singapore Airshow, an event for which it has to register more than 500 cars.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The investment, KKR's first in Malaysia, was sealed via a partnership agreement signed in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.\n\nFounded in 1976 and helmed by Henry Kravis and George Roberts, KKR has some US$84 billion in assets under management and has located its South-east Asia regional headquarters in Singapore.\n\nThe firm's investment comes ahead of WAS' public share sale anticipated next year.\n\nWAS group managing director Azman Syed Ibrahim said: \"We do have plans, but want to grow the company before we move on to an IPO (initial public offering).\"\n\nKKR member and regional head of South-east Asia Ming Lu said an IPO was \"not a near-term priority, but one of the options\".\n\nWAS' fleet now comprises 35 helicopters, mainly AugustaWetlands; it has acquired another 10, two recently delivered.\n\nMr Azman has often been referred to by the Malaysian media as one of the country's top \"AP Kings\" for being one of the biggest beneficiaries of import permits required to bring in completely- knocked down vehicles. (AP stands for Approved Permit.)\n\nCritics of the country's controversial AP system, established to give bumiputras a leg-up in the automotive sector, contend that the permits are often sold for between RM40,000 and RM50,000 each, depending on the make of the vehicle.\n\nUnder trade pacts, the AP system is to be dismantled from 2015.\n\nIn a speech sketching the history of WAS, Mr Azman noted that the firm had started with just one helicopter and five staff. The business took off sharply in 2008 after it won a bid from state-owned Petronas Carigali to provide offshore aviation services; more contracts followed in 2011, including a 10-year multi-billion-dollar deal to provide oil and gas rotary wing services to five oil majors in the region.\n\nDomestically, the aviation sector has attracted considerable private investments in the last two to three years, courtesy of prioritisation by the government.\n\nMr Azman said WAS now services 16 firms, and that it was looking to KKR not only for funding, but also for insights into \"how to manage a big operation\".\n\nMr Lu described WAS as having \"tremendous growth opportunities\" from the strong demand driven by robust oil and gas activities.\n\nKKR's investments in the region include Avogo, Unisteel, Masan Consumer and PT Tiga Pilar Sejahtera Food Tbk.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It was a hippie haven for counterculture types, populated by biker gangs, drug dealers and streetwalkers, but the space suited their budget and they had a daring plan to make an impact on the city's fast-growing fine-dining scene - helping to transform the street for the better.\n\n\"We took a biker club and turned it into Relae - it was a perfect spot for shady business but even better for a restaurant,\" says Puglisi, a noted young chef with impeccable culinary credentials (El Bulli, Noma). \"We knew that what we were doing could give the street a push - our food would conquer the street, and then the city.\"\n\nA casual observer walking down Jaegersborggade will be unaware of its colourful past. Many of the 19th-century buildings are unrestored, but while parts of the street are still rough around the edges - unwittingly pointing your camera at certain buildings and residents hanging around street corners will provoke a negative response - there is an unmistakable sense that the gentrification of Jaegersborggade is here to stay.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n2\n\nDollar-selling is becoming a bubble, which may burst, HSBC says\n\n3\n\nStocks to watch: SGX, Frasers Centrepoint Trust, NTT DC Reit, BRC Asia\n\n4\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\n5\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value", "images": []}

With a bit of craft and originality, it can be twisted into either a comedy or drama.\n\nJapanese director-writer Hirokazu Kore-eda goes for the latter in his latest film Like Father Like Son; he also turns it into a slow-burning tearjerker. It's the arthouse filmmaker's most accessible work to date because of the familiar subject matter he had chosen to explore and execute in his typical low-key style.\n\nBar one very obvious hanky moment in the third act, the rest of Like Father Like Son tugs gently at the audience's heartstrings, putting a lump in their throats rather than trying to make them bawl their eyes out throughout.\n\nNot one to exploit the melodrama cheaply, Kore-eda goes for a sensitive light touch, allowing the story to unfold quietly rather than shoehorning the film with a series of dramatic moments.\n\nSinger-actor Masaharu Fukuyama plays Ryota, a workaholic salaryman whose perfect world with his wife, Midori (Machiko Ono), is turned upside down when the hospital informs them that the boy Keita (Keita Ninomiya), whom the couple has been raising for the last six years as their son, isn't actually theirs.\n\nA mix-up had resulted in two infants being switched at birth and the couple's real son, Ryusei (Hwang Sho-gen), had gone on to be raised by another couple, Yudai (famed author and illustrator Lily Franky) and Yukari (Yoko Maki). The hospital arranges for both sets of parents to meet and discuss the possibility of doing a switch so they get their right boys back.\n\nKore-eda paints a contrasting image of both couples - Ryota and Midori are cool urbanites while Yudai and Yukari are bohemian small-town folk. That also means that there's a difference in how they raise their boys.\n\nAs a perfectionist, Ryota demands that Keita makes no mistakes while Yudai is less concerned with disciplining Ryusei simply because he's a man-child himself.\n\nThe plot is slightly lopsided with the mums sidelined and having significantly smaller roles. A huge chunk of Kore-eda's story centres on the boys' relationships with their new dads. Too much focus is also given to Ryota's fixation on blood being thicker than water; hence his inability to accept Keita as his own, even though he's been treating the boy as his son before he found out the truth.\n\nLike Kore-eda's 2004 latchkey-children drama Nobody Knows, the cute tykes steal the audience's hearts with their antics. Ninomiya, in particular, is a little heartbreaker turning on the charm offensive with his huge eyes and boyish innocence.\n\nIt might not be Kore-eda's finest hour but the Japanese auteur has spun a watchable and heartwarming tale out of a familiar premise to make Like Father Like Son feel like his own.\n\nRating: B-\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/technology/orchestrating-tableau-big-data", "site_title": "Orchestrating tableau of big data", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nOrchestrating tableau of big data\n\nTableau Software wants to be the data crunching tool for everyone\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Oct 27, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nBACK in 2003, three Stanford engineers were huddled in Christian Chabot's bedroom, working on a data research project funded by the US Department of Defence.\n\nMr Chabot, Chris Stolte and Pat Hanrahan quickly realised that beyond the project, the business of data would become something big years down the road, when it would matter even to mainstream companies.\n\nThe three went on to found Tableau Software, which has been specialising in providing business intelligence and data analytics software from its inception.\n\n\"I was a data analyst earlier in my career after graduating. I was a number cruncher and I knew I needed better tools,\" Mr Chabot, Tableau's CEO, tells BizIT.\n\nFast forward to today and that bet paid off. The company is in the thick of a big data awakening in the tech industry. Industry analyst IDC estimates that between 2005 and 2020, the amount of digital bytes we have will grow from 130 exabytes to 40,000 exabytes.\n\nAmid this trend, big companies are scrambling to put resources into churning out data analysis and business intelligence features in their products.\n\nLooking at just German software giant, SAP, and its partners alone, collectively they will make US$220 billion together over the next five years based on big data, said IDC.\n\nAnd McKinsey thinks that in the US, big data use could drive US$325 billion in extra annual GDP in the retail and manufacturing sector by the year 2020. Big data will also cut US$285 billion in costs in public and health care sectors in the country.\n\nFor Tableau, it's gathered significant momentum over the past few years. Revenue was US$34.2 million in 2010, growing to US$62.4 million the following year, and nearly doubling again to US$127.7 million in 2012.\n\nThe company also started trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in May this year, with Mr Chabot, Mr Stolte and Mr Hanrahan as CEO, chief development officer, and chief scientist of the company, respectively.\n\nThe big data story, however, wasn't always this obvious to the industry, Mr Chabot says.\n\n\"Ten years ago, no investors were talking business software at all - they were keen on consumer companies. The companies getting all the attention were sites like Monster, Google and Match.com.\n\n\"And so we bootstrapped the company for about three years, because we didn't convince investors during the early stages,\" he says.\n\nStill, the founders stayed lean and doggedly chased the goal of pushing the company past the red.\n\n\"We've been cashflow-positive since the end of our first year,\" he says proudly. \"But it took a lot of selling, because nobody knew what big data was. I would drive around Silicon Valley in my 1994 used Geo Prizm with a laptop in my trunk, and meet with companies from parking lot to parking lot.\"\n\nThose meetings eventually led to a meeting with American supermarket chain Safeway. \"It was our first US$10,000 sale. US$10,000! That's huge, especially when you're a small company,\" he says.\n\nSafeway wanted Tableau's technology to help it slice and dice its Club Card loyalty programme member base, so it could improve the types of discounts pushed to individual members.\n\nThe applications of data crunching continue to expand, as more data-driven services enter the mainstream consumer consciousness, explains Mr Chabot.\n\n\"We never anticipated the rise of Facebook's social graph in 2003, or that tablets would increase the rate of data generated and consumed by everyone.\n\n\"But the fundamental problem is the same. We want to understand data. Underneath the changing platforms and devices, there is the need to understand data. A thousand years from now, that issue will remain,\" he says.\n\nAnd as consumers get savvy with navigating intelligent searches on sites like Facebook, they're pushing enterprises to keep up, he adds.\n\n\"People use advanced platforms like Google and Facebook at home, and then they go to the office and are faced with antiquated systems. This dissonance helps drive change,\" he says, noting that the world's leading corporations could learn a thing or two from the way that Facebook has architected its database.\n\n\"The types of systems that Facebook rolls out is more advanced than anything a bank could, because Facebook is on a bigger cloud, its internal analytics is far more sophisticated, it has more data, and a younger workforce driving it,\" he says.\n\nThis admiration for the Facebooks and Googles of the world is why Tableau has set out to be the data crunching tool for everyone, he says.\n\n\"We don't want to attack the market by verticals. We want to be a horizontal tool giving people access to business intelligence without being systems specialists or statisticians.\"\n\nSome of Tableau's competition beat the same drum. San Francisco-based Splunk, for example, was founded the same year as Tableau. Its Web-based interface is clearly designed to target the same group of Gen Z workers that Tableau professes to be courting.\n\nOn the mention of Splunk, Mr Chabot shakes his head, saying: \"Splunk is a tool for IT people. It's programming-intensive, and it's focused on machine data so you still need to be able to write some code to make sense of it all. We are exactly the opposite. We're for everyone else: teachers, doctors, dentists. We're for anyone with a spread sheet or database.\"\n\nAnd he isn't worried about larger companies building analytics functions into their products. With the way that data is exploding from every device out there, chances are it won't all be found in one place, defeating the purpose of running analytics on just one source.\n\n\"It's not all sitting in your ERP (enterprise resource planning) software. It's in the cloud, it's in your log files, in your Microsoft Excel sheets,\" he says.\n\nThe company sells itself to customers on the pitch that they'll need an agnostic tool to cover all these bases.\n\n\"Don't overthink it,\" says Mr Chabot.\n\nAt just 41 years of age, the executive is visibly excited to helm the company on its rapid expansion.\n\nIts employee count, some 700 people in December 2012, has now hit 930, spread out across the globe.\n\nThe company is headquartered in Seattle, and has two more US offices in Menlo Park and Kirkland.\n\nIn 2011, it started expanding internationally, opening in London. In 2012 it launched its Singapore, Tokyo and Dublin offices, with Sydney coming on board most recently.\n\nHe's keen on sinking Tableau's roots deeper in Asia, where there are millions of growing SMBs (small and medium-sized businesses) ripe for the picking.\n\n\"SMB spending overall might be smaller than large corporates, but honestly, that's not the reason larger companies aren't able to service them as well. It's because traditional products are complex. If your product is easy to use, you can service SMBs in a sustainable way. Salesforce.com is doing that well, for example,\" says Mr Chabot.\n\nFor the first half of 2013, Tableau's Asia-Pacific business doubled compared with the previous corresponding quarter. In 2012, annual growth was 105 per cent year-over-year.\n\nIn Singapore, its customers tend to be larger corporations because of the high number of multinationals located here. It also counts the Singapore government as a customer.\n\nThe focus on SMBs also complements Tableau's recent focus on cloud-based products. In July, it started offering Tableau Online, a hosted version of its Tableau Server product. It's since attracted a base of 200 customers.\n\nMr Chabot foresees a future where cloud computing will eliminate IT departments entirely.\n\n\"Think about it this way. We're all in a talent war. Really cutting edge companies like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, we're all struggling to get data analysts and statisticians. And if the tech industry is struggling, how do you think your average bank out in the mid-West is doing in that regard?\"\n\nThe point of cloud computing, he says, is that it's become the natural answer to the struggle to populate in-house IT departments with talent good enough for tomorrow's data issues.\n\n\"This is probably some way off, but at some point we'll look back and laugh at the age of IT departments. It's silly,\" he says.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Not in terms of design, but with the use of textile as a medium for contemporary art. Instead of embroidery for decoration, it is embroidery for change, loaded with socio-political messages.\n\nSiributr was last seen at this year's Art Stage Singapore showcased as part of Project Stage, a curated platform dedicated to young cutting-edge artists and interesting galleries in the Asia-Pacific art scene.\n\nHe was presented by Yavuz Fine Art, which is also representing the 44-year- old artist in his first solo in Singapore now. is a continuation of that Art Stage Singapore work, he says. \"But what I'm presenting this time is an installation of works done on uniforms so that the work is more three-dimensional.\"\n\nThe centrepiece of the exhibition is , a groundbreaking large-scale installation that examines Thailand's turbulent political scene. Consisting of 39 white uniforms of the Thai civil service embroidered with the portraits of current and past politicians (including ex- premier Thaksin Shinawatra), the work asks audiences to consider and judge the current political system, its representatives, and the latter's effectiveness in giving voice to Thai citizens.\n\nThe show at Yavuz also includes five hand-embroidered tapestries which are 2 metres by 1.6 metres. Siributr does most of the embroidery himself, but he does have one assistant who helps him with the beading. It normally takes him 12-18 months to prepare for a show, he shares.\n\nA former university lecturer, Siributr didn't plan on being an artist until just seven years ago. In fact, it didn't cross his mind at all.\n\n\"I've liked art and design since I was a child. That's why I chose a subject related to art - textile design - when I went to university in the US. But it was for the commercial aspects. I never thought I could make a career out of being an artist,\" he says candidly.\n\nBut he started creating art pieces in his free time. Siributr's first exhibition was in 1998. Then, in the early 2000s, he quit his teaching job to write for publications. In 2003 he even started to edit a magazine.\n\nHe took the plunge to become a full-time artist in 2006, when he stopped all other jobs and concentrated fully on art. \"Because I didn't have enough time, I wasn't progressing and evolving as an artist. To create works on a larger scale, I needed to devote more time to it.\"\n\nSiributr is attracted to folk art - which is expressive and carries the emotions of the maker, he feels. \"You see the heart of a person translated into a work of art.\"\n\nAbout the political expressions in his art, Siributr says it was inevitable given the happenings in the last few years. \"When I first returned to Thailand, politics was the last thing I paid attention to because I found it boring. So if you look at my early works, they were more abstract, focusing on textures and colours for expression,\" he explains.\n\nBut he couldn't ignore the political changes in his country since 2008, so his works quickly evolved. \"It's a reaction to what's happening around me. So, of course, these are inspiration. Society, religion and politics - they're all inter- connected.

I have a voice, and these are mainly my personal reactions and viewpoints towards what's going on.\"\n\nThe key problem, he says, is that power and wealth are concentrated in the hands of the elite, and the rich-poor gap is huge. \"When I first came back and led student expeditions to villages to learn about traditional weaving, it was an introduction to a Thailand I didn't know,\" says the son of a civil servant.\n\nAs an ex-university lecturer and civil servant, he himself wore the uniform he has now embroidered - using them as a reference to authority in Thailand.\n\nBesides exhibiting in Thailand, Siributr has had two shows in New York.

Under it, financial institutions must consider borrowers' outstanding debt obligations and ensure, for instance, that their monthly debt obligations stay within 60 per cent of their monthly income.\n\nThe composite index aside, the individual property sectors were also hit, with the residential sector taking it hardest.\n\nPrime residential sector sentiment suffered with a net balance of -46 per cent; future net balance was -38 per cent. In Q2, the corresponding figures were -35 per cent and -32 per cent.\n\nThe net balance is the difference between the proportion of respondents who were optimistic and those who were pessimistic.\n\nThe suburban residential property segment went into negative territory, recording -30 per cent in current net balance (from +8 per cent in Q2) and -40 per cent in future net balance (-20 per cent in Q2).\n\nThe office and the hotel/serviced apartment sectors rode a wave of confidence. The office sector recorded a current net balance of +19 per cent and a future net balance of +31 per cent.\n\nThe hotel/serviced apartment sector had a current net balance of +10 per cent, and a future net balance of +20 per cent.\n\nA survey respondent attributed this to the upbeat outlook for the hotel industry, given a vigorous tourism industry.\n\nA total of 42 per cent of the respondents, down from 55 per cent in Q2, expect the number of residential property launches to hold steady, though 65 per cent, up from 21 per cent in Q2, expect moderately lower unit prices in the near term.\n\nMore than 55 per cent of the respondents believe that the TDSR framework will impose a drag on residential property sales and raise the number of unsold residential units.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Headline-grabbing accidents over the past couple of years, such as the sinking of the Costa Concordia off the coast of Italy, have hurt demand in the cruise industry.\n\nWhile the incidents aboard Royal Caribbean ships have not been as serious, the company has been forced to cut prices to revive demand. The company said prices for the first quarter of 2014 remained steady from a year earlier and trended higher for the following quarters. Pricing in the Caribbean, however, remained under pressure, and advance bookings were weaker, the company said.\n\nRoyal Caribbean raised its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to US$2.30-2.35 per share from US$2.20-2.30 per share. The company said it expected net yields, a measure of ticket sales and money spent onboard, to rise about 3 per cent in 2013.\n\nThe company's net income fell slightly to US$365.7 million, or US$1.65 per share, in the quarter from US$367.8 million, or US$1.68 per share, a year earlier. It earned US$1.71 per share on an adjusted basis, higher than the average analyst estimate of US$1.65. Total revenue rose 3.5 per cent to US$2.31 billion, beating average analyst estimate of US$2.26 billion. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM", "images": []}

By that yardstick, \"we have succeeded\", he said in an interview, adding that the results speak for themselves.\n\nFrom virtually zilch over a decade ago, BMS now account for about 10 per cent of manufacturing output, behind electronics, chemicals and engineering. An earlier biomedical output target of \"S$25 billion by 2015\" was surpassed in 2011 when production hit S$27 billion; 2012 saw further growth to S$29.4 billion.\n\nIn value-add terms - which include wages and other costs - the economic contribution is even more significant: BMS is the top performer, accounting for 26 per cent of total manufacturing value-add. In other words, even with a smaller share of the output pie, it is the biggest value contributor. The cluster employs some 15,700 people, mainly in high value jobs. Said Mr Lim, who co-chairs a BMS executive committee that coordinates the BMS Initiative launched in June 2000: \"Imagine if we hadn't gone into biomedical sciences... our manufacturing composition would have been so different and we would have missed out on heaps, so this is proof of the pudding.\"\n\nThe government spends about 1 per cent of GDP on total R&D, and the private sector another 1.5-2 per cent. For 2011-2015, the government committed S$16.1 billion for R&D, of which about 40 per cent has been allocated to the biomedical sciences.\n\n\"What's heartening is - it's not just the government pumping in money but there is, in fact, faster growth in private sector research spending,\" Mr Lim noted.\n\n\"The whole point of government investing in public sector research is to catalyse private sector research.\"\n\nIndeed, latest figures as of Oct 1 show that 68 companies have committed S$130 million for 155 research projects in collaboration with A*Star's 10 biomedical research institutes and consortia.\n\nProcter & Gamble, the world's leading consumer health giant, has taken up the entire Phase 4 of the Biopolis for its Singapore Innovation Centre, adding to its presence here and joining a host of top BMS companies such as Abbott, GSK and Novartis that have made Biopolis their home. The newly completed S$250 million P&G Innovation Centre, which will house 500 researchers, will undertake strategic upstream corporate research jointly with A*Star, focusing on personal and healthcare.\n\nThe P&G venture points to the direction of Singapore's BMS journey, now in its third phase. After focusing on building basic research capabilities and then developing translational and clinical research in the first two phases, the emphasis now is on \"economic outcomes\", specifically, delivering health and wealth.\n\nBut \"we don't want to pick winners, we want to look for diversification\", said Mr Lim. Having established a strong base in pharmaceuticals, biologics and medical technology over the past decade, the BMS effort has turned of late to growing two new clusters: food and nutrition, and personal care.\n\nLast week, A*Star and the National University of Singapore jointly announced the setting up of a S$148 million centre to study the nutrition needs of Asians. The new BMS clusters arise from a strategic zeroing in on two key trends today: the rising Asian middle class and open innovation.\n\n\"There is a further point to the rising Asian market,\" said Mr Lim. \"Increasingly, companies know it's not enough to sell to the markets; it's very important to know the particular needs of the market and respond to them.\" The fact that \"the Asian phenotype is a bit different\" matters to makers of skincare products and fragrances, for example.\n\n\"So there's a need for companies to do research and innovation in the market for the market\". This, he added, presents huge opportunities that Singapore has been quick to seize.\n\nThe biggest business spending in research today is in Asia, he noted.\n\nAt the same time, companies are \"moving in a big way\" towards joint R&D with external parties, particularly public sector organisations, and are not relying entirely on their own ideas.\n\n\"This shift is very powerful,\" he said. \"For example, Sanofi CEO Chris Viehbacher said early last year that the company will move from 70:30 (70 per cent inhouse innovation, 30 per cent open innovation) to 50:50.\n\n\"P&G in their annual report talked about US$3 billion incremental revenue a year, all of which will come from open innovation.\"\n\nBuilding on its 2010 partnership with A*Star's Institute of Medical Biology to reconstruct Asian skin from cultured cells, the French L'Oreal Group set up an Advanced Research Centre here last December to understand human skin diversity.\n\nSo \"there is a stream of companies looking to do research in Asia, they are just looking for the right partners\", Mr Lim said. \"Singapore has to respond to this, to ensure that we have the right environment, infrastructure, to be able to compete.\"\n\nThe A*Star chief believes that Singapore - with now a \"very complete\" BMS landscape, including talent pool - is holding its own.\n\n\"Singapore is very competitive when it comes to the ability to attract MNCs,\" he said. \"Compared to other research hubs in the world - their multinationals are domestic... you go to Switzerland, you have Roche, Novartis, these are Swiss companies. In fact, we are probably the only location in the world with multinationals that are non-domestic.\"\n\nThe BMS MNCs' presence creates spinoffs for local firms and a growing pool of startups. \"And it's not just industry; there's real intellectual capital, real knowledge, that's created in Singapore,\" he said, referring to scientific papers, patents and discoveries by scientists here.\n\nBut it is an ongoing mission to grow Singapore's economic space via the science and technology arena - Mr Lim is on the road \"a lot of the time\" selling Singapore's \"value propositions\" as a R&D hub. Most recently in Japan, he goes \"anywhere in the world that can bring value to Singapore\".\n\nEven among the big names already at Biopolis, there is always room to grow their activity here.\n\nThe P&G Innovation Centre, for example, \"doesn't mean the end\", he said. \"We are already developing new things with them, constantly finding new opportunities, creating new value propositions for them.\"\n\nTo underscore the point, he cited what he took away from a trip to China in 2008. \"You got to listen to the Chinese vision to know that you got to run even faster,\" he laughed.\n\n\"They used three two-word phrases which all sound alike, zhi zao.\n\n\"The first zhi zao is 'self-build': China building for China.\n\n\"The second zhi zao is China as a manufacturing centre, building for the whole world.\n\n\"The third zhi zao is the most powerful, speaking of zhi hui - 'knowledge creation'.\n\n\"When they start going into that in a strong way, we'd better be much better. So, for us, it's very clear; if we don't do this, we cannot remain relevant and competitive.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So you will see prices pop up again . . . but I don't think it's the start of a new trend as some people describe,\" said Dr Xie in an interview with BT.\n\nThis is despite official data in September showing that new home prices rose in 69 of 70 major cities in August. According to China's National Bureau of Statistics, price increases ranged from 2.3 per cent to 19.3 per cent.\n\nAccording to Dr Xie, this momentary recovery is not sustainable as the money supply is not picking up. Indeed, Premier Li Keqiang had himself said that the Chinese government would not rely on macroeconomic adjustments such as increasing the fiscal deficit and loosening money supply when faced with downward pressure on the economy, pointed out Dr Xie.\n\nLooking ahead, Dr Xie said that he expects prices to continue its downward trajectory, but \"in waves\".\n\nHowever, Tier 1 cities will fare differently from Tier 2, Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities.\n\nHe expects that Tier 2 cities such as Chengdu and Chongqing may make a comeback.\n\n\"They have a big population base so when prices come down sufficiently, people may buy again. Tier 1 cities don't have to worry about demand, it's really about affordability,\" said Dr Xie.\n\n\"What I see is that when prices drop to two months' salary per square metre, you will see demand surge. Now, it's twice as expensive. So it will correct over the next five years - wages will rise a bit, and prices will come down a bit.\"\n\nDr Xie was speaking at the sidelines of a joint event held by the Economist Corporate Network and Raffles Quay Asset Management to talk about China's property market. His speech was titled: \"China: Has the dragon lost its fire?\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It manages around US$300 million for institutional clients.\n\nNikko AM president and chief executive Charles Beazley said TAAM's investment approach and strength among an institutional client base are a strong fit with Nikko, which remains keen to expand further. \"Singapore is our most important hub. We're going to be adding more (capabilities), we haven't stopped. This is a very good acquisition. It strengthens our capabilities but we're looking for more investment capabilities and managers.''\n\nHe added: \"We all got lucky. We were looking at the same time that Peter was looking for new shareholders.''\n\nNikko AM manages some US$156 billion in assets.\n\nTAAM is a \"bottom up, fundamentally driven investment house\", said Mr Sartori. Its portfolios are fairly concentrated in 40 to 60 stocks. Its holding period for stocks ranges between three and five years.\n\n\"One area and reason to pursue a partner was that we believe we needed further sales support. We're entirely investment professionals. We think we're in a position to grow a lot in the coming years. Nikko can support us while maintaining our investment culture.\"\n\nTAAM will be fully integrated into Nikko Asset Management. Its team of eight investment professionals will become employees. Peter will take on the role of head of Asian equities.\n\nBased on information on TAAM's website, its TAAM New Asia Fund has generated returns of 4.12 per cent per annum since inception in November 2005 until Sept 30, compared to the index's return of 5.78 per cent.\n\nMr Sartori said investor focus is shifting from South-east Asia towards North Asia. TAAM is overweight China, for instance. \"South-east Asian stocks are expensive and very well owned. We think there is some risk there in the next one to three years. We're finding bottom up ideas in North Asia.''\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This year also, the dance festival will travel to Malaysia.\n\nThe two residencies in Singapore and Malaysia will help the young choreographers get on to a more international platform and give them better exposure, believes Mr Kuik. \"These young artists have talent, but don't have the network and platform and opportunities,\" he notes.\n\nDance collaborations are commonplace for choreographers and companies in Japan, Korea and Taiwan, but less so for Singapore and Malaysia, he adds. \"And it's quite important for our artists because we should be better plugged into the contemporary dance culture in Asia, and have a better understanding of the different Asian cultures.\"\n\nThis year, Contact has paired Singapore and Japanese artists, and Korean and Malaysian artists - with each residency taking place in Singapore and Malaysia for three weeks. T.H.E Second Company pioneering member Liz Fong partners Yuriko Suzuki from the Yokohama Dance Collection in Singapore, and Seoul Dance Collection award-winning Korean choreographer Choi Myung Hyun will be working with former Cloud Gate dancer and Damansara Performing Arts Centre Dance Company's Artistic Director Wong Jyh Shyong.\n\n\"It's not easy to break into the Korean and Japanese dance scene,\" Mr Kuik says, in an interview from Seoul last week, when T.H.E. Dance Company was performing at the Seoul International Dance Festival.\n\nInstead of having international artists perform here, and Singapore artists perform overseas, Mr Kuik sees collaborations as a way to challenge and stretch choreographers and dancers. \"It's a challenging format because it means choreographers have to make more choices and with that the difficulty level increases. But at the same time, it's a new stimulus that pulls artists out of their comfort zone.\"\n\nCollaborations also mean more possibilities, with another pair of eyes and another spirit. \"If you do something yourself, it's just your own style. But another collaborator will stimulate more,\" he adds.\n\nThe inter-Asian collaborations also promote better understanding of another country's culture and society patterns and dynamic, Mr Kuik notes. \"In these globalised times, the benefits are obvious.\"\n\nWith the platform for young artists, Mr Kuik also points out that this will be the next generation of dancers, with a different thinking, approach and vocabulary - that belonging to an \"e-generation\".\n\n\"It'll be interesting to see how they express themselves in dance.\"\n\nContact 2013 - to be held from Nov 29 to Dec 8 - will feature 16 international and regional artists from nine countries. In Malaysia, Contact will be part of the inaugural edition of the d'MOTION International Dance Festival 2013.

This programme, which will involve maritime industry experts and members of academia, will last for an initial period of three years.\n\nAnother $8.1 million will be spent on setting up the Maritime Energy Test Bed Facility at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), which will be operationally ready in 2015. This facility will help get technological innovations from the laboratory to large-scale application.\n\n\"The facility will be a significant component in demonstrating and raising Singapore's maritime R&D capabilities and expertise,\" SMI said.\n\nSMI will contribute $4.7 million to the facility, while NTU will come up with the remaining $3.4 million.\n\nThese two projects are part of an overarching roadmap for R&D that was also unveiled at the SMI forum yesterday. The roadmap sets out a framework for R&D developments across the maritime, marine and offshore fields up until 2025.\n\nAccording to SMI, five key R&D focus areas have been identified for the maritime sector, while another five have been determined for the marine and offshore sector.\n\n\"These initiatives are indeed exciting developments not only for SMI, but Maritime Singapore as well. I hope these initiatives further facilitate collaborations between SMI, the industry players and our partners in academia,\" said S S Teo, chairman of SMI's board and governing council, during his opening address at the forum.\n\nSince SMI's inception, about $33 million in funding has been committed to 20 projects for the industry.\n\n\"SMI will also set aside significant funding to support R&D activities as per the R&D roadmap,\" Mr Teo added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But economists remain far apart over whether the economy will take the tax hike in its stride as it moves slowly out of chronic deflation, or sink back into the stagnation that had dogged it for many years.\n\nMr Abe softened the blow of the first tax hike since 1997 by announcing a 5 trillion yen (S$64 billion) economic stimulus package - matching the size of the money that the tax raise will take out of the economy in a full year plus one trillion yen in corporate tax cuts and cash benefits for low-income earners. Details of the stimulus package will be determined in early December and an extra budget for fiscal 2013 aimed at funding it will be compiled in an integrated manner with an initial budget for fiscal 2014 through March 2015 at the end of this year, officials said.\n\nAt the same time, Mr Abe said he had asked the ruling political parties (his own Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner, the New Komeito Party) to begin discussions on cutting the corporate tax rate, which he noted was \"high\" by international standards. \"This is an issue that needs serious scrutiny in order for Japan to overcome global competition, lure investment from around the world and achieve sustained economic growth,\" he told a press conference last night.\n\nThe government also plans to end a special corporate tax surcharge introduced to fund reconstruction work following the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami one year earlier than scheduled at the end of next March.\n\nThe first round of the two-stage consumption tax hike had been conditional upon a favourable outlook for the Japanese economy being maintained by October, and Mr Abe used the BOJ's latest quarterly Tankan report to justify his move.\n\nThe Tankan showed business confidence among large manufacturers increased in September from three months earlier to plus 12 - its highest level since December 2007, well ahead of the improvement forecast in recent media surveys.\n\nIt also showed that sentiment among non-manufacturing companies such as those related to construction and services rose to plus 14 from plus 12 in the previous quarterly survey, matching average estimates, though corporate capital investment plans were scaled back slightly.\n\n\"The improvement in the Tankan's diffusion index regarding employment conditions suggests a declining unemployment rate and rising wages down the road,\" Daiju Aoki, senior economist at UBS Securities Japan, told Kyodo news service\n\nEconomists say that wage rises are critical if personal consumption in Japan is to maintain recent improving trends and if \"cost-push\" inflationary trends - driven by the weak yen and rising import prices - are to be replaced by \"demand-pull\" pressures driven by rising incomes.\n\nThose opposed to the consumption tax increase at this stage say the timing is bad as the economy is likely to be hit by import cost-driven increases in commodity and service prices in Japan, as well as by pension system-related payments.\n\n\"There is a risk that sharp price increases and an economic deterioration will unfold simultaneously as consumers will become more inclined to limit expenditures,\" the chief economist at the Daiichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo was quoted as saying.\n\nBut chief economist Masaaki Kanno at JPMorgan Securities Japan, argued that it was a matter of now or never for the consumption tax hike, and that \"economic conditions in and outside Japan could not be better\" for making such a move.\n\nSimilar opinion splits exist among Mr Abe's close advisers and Cabinet members with some arguing that the need to curb the massive government debt - in excess of 200 per cent of GDP - must be paramount while others are in favour of more incremental tax hikes.\n\nIn the end, the \"finance ministry camp\" appears to have won out and Mr Abe has allowed calls for fiscal consolidation in Japan from the international community well as from within the country to prevail over warnings that a sales tax hike could undermine \"Abenomics\" and his own political position.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The publication and the GTI are prepared by the NUS Business School's Centre for Governance, Institutions and Organisations (CGIO), in partnership with CPA Australia and The Business Times.\n\nAccording to the publication, companies classified as \"multi-industry\" were the best scorers, overall. A strong second were companies from the finance sector - most likely because of the stringent governance standards banks and financial institutions have to adhere to. Transport, storage and communication companies were a very close third.\n\nThe commerce sector racked up the poorest showing.\n\nSingapore Exchange had topped the GTI 2013 rankings, when the individual scores were announced in August. SingTel and Keppel Corp were second and third, respectively.\n\nCompanies, in general, scored marginally better in disclosure practices for this year's GTI, compared with last year. Fourteen companies, compared with 12 previously, made exact disclosures of their top executives's pay.\n\nThe bulk of companies, or 82.8 per cent of all listed ones ranked, still chose to disclose their executive remunerations over a range of levels, instead of exact amounts, compared with 77.6 per cent in 2012.\n\nThe lower proportion last year, however, was due to the fact that more of the remaining companies did not comply with corporate governance standards here at all.\n\nThe report also noted that, with the revised Code of Corporate Governance placing greater responsibility for risk management on boards, more companies have risen to meet this new standard.\n\nCompared with 5.9 per cent before, 8.9 per cent of companies had a separate board-level risk committee.\n\nAlso, 9.9 per cent of the companies ranked now have assurance of financial statements provided by their CEOs/CFOs, compared with just 1.0 per cent in 2012.\n\n\"This report will be a significant reference tool for measuring companies' governance disclosures and practices, and identifying areas of improvement,\" said CPA Australia's Singapore divisional president, associate professor Themin Suwardy.\n\nThe publication was distributed at the CPA Congress 2013, organised by CPA Australia, yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Round off the whole package with handmade mince pies ($2 each) served with luscious lashings of brandy butter. With this much goodness going on, it's too bad Christmas only comes around once a year.\n\nThe crackling roast pork is available in three sizes, large ($120) extra large ($150) and supersize ($180). Place orders by calling or sending an SMS to 91195994 or email enquiry@keithkin.com at least a week in advance. Pre-orders available for pick-up from their retail outlet in PasarBella (The Grandstand, 200 Turf Club Road) or central kitchen in Geylang (9 Geylang Lorong 21A) until 7pm on Christmas Eve and 3pm on Christmas Day.\n\nHoney-glazed ham with Oriental pineapple chutney\n\nTIRED of the usual pineapple-plastered leg of ham? Pan Pacific Hotel serves theirs up with subtle Asian inflections this year. Unlike most hams, their version is not overly salty, and the accompanying pineapple chutney seasoned with chilli, coriander and white vinegar. The hotel's executive chef Vincent Aw says the acidity of the pineapple neutralises the sweetness of the honey glaze and saltiness of the ham. Sounds and tastes good to us.\n\nS$120 for 2kg, available for order and takeaway at the Pacific Marketplace, Level 1 of Pan Pacific Singapore. For enquiries or to order, email\n\ncelebrate.sin@panpacific.com\n\nor call 6826 8240, or head to their online store,\n\nwww.pacificmarketplace.sg\n\nThai\n\nTom yum turkey\n\nIF you're the kind of person who likes to add a bit of spice to everything, then you'd probably get a real kick out of The Glass House's Thai-inspired tom yum turkey, specially created this year. A whole turkey is first marinated in a melange of Thai condiments such as lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves and fish sauce before being roasted and served with a tom yum tinged gravy on the side. The modern Asian-fusion restaurant has also come up with a laksa variation that is first bathed in fragrant coconut curry broth, baked until tender and then served with yet another round of laksa gravy. A generous helping of baby carrots, new potatoes and brussels sprouts help to keep any pangs of guilt at bay.\n\n$140 per turkey, available from today till Dec 24 from The Glass House at Hotel Fort Canning, 11 Canning Walk. Order must be made three working days in advance, call 6559 6760 or e-mail\n\nfnb@hfcsingapore.com\n\nIndian\n\nTurkey Raan and turkey pankhi\n\nORDERING a whole turkey for a cosy gathering can sometimes mean having to eat leftovers for the rest of the week, but smaller parties can now be spared with Tandoor restaurant's turkey raan and turkey pankhi creations. Suitable for health-conscious eaters, the turkey pankhi is a turkey breast stuffed with lightly spiced cream cheese and mushrooms and grilled in the tandoori oven.\n\nThe turkey raan is a whole turkey leg prepared in the traditional Raan style - the Indian equivalent of an English Sunday roast, that is marinated and cooked slowly over a whole day - resulting in a juicy, aromatic leg that debunks all notion of turkey as dry, tasteless meat. Both portions are equivalent to about a quarter of a whole turkey and will feed two just nicely as a main course.\n\nThe turkey pankhi and turkey raan, both $32, and a whole tandoori turkey, $88, are available as both dine-in dishes or for takeaway at Tandoor at the Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre. Takeaway orders must be made three days in advance. For reservations and orders, call 6733 8333.\n\nTandoori turkey\n\nIT'S not quite new but it's been so well received, the tandoori turkey phenomenon looks like it's here to stay. And who better to get your feast from than Indian fine dining stalwart, the Song of India? Just for the festive season, the restaurant's executive chef Munjanath Mural has created a stuffed tandoori turkey, first marinated in a special homemade tandoori paste and slowly cooked to perfection in a clay tandoori oven. Or go the whole hog and opt for its more lavish varient, a whole turkey stuffed with a flavourful morel mushroom biryani for that extra oomph.\n\n$109 for a whole tandoori turkey or $129 for a whole turkey stuffed with morel biryani, available from Dec 20 to 26 from the Song of India, 33 Scotts Road.

Her version comprises young turkey breast first stuffed with a free range chicken egg, claypot-roasted next and then braised in a smokey bumbu rojak sauce, a lighter version of rendang - the latter move to prevent the meet from drying out, she says. The turkey breasts come vacuum packed for fuss-free reheating, and can keep for up to a week refrigerated. The approximately 1kg portions are designed for people with small families of two or three in mind, says Ms Ong.\n\n$58 from Table at 7, 7 Mohamed Sultan Road #01-01.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/taking-leaf-ceylon", "site_title": "Taking a leaf from Ceylon", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nTaking a leaf from Ceylon\n\nTea has shaped both the land and economy of Sri Lanka since the mid-19th century, and the tradition continues today. By Cheah Ui-hoon\n\nPublished Fri, Nov 29, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE morning starts early at Nuwara Eliya, the highlands of central Sri Lanka. Just after 5am, the horizon of misty mountain is visible tones beneath the intensifying orange sky. As the sun rises, the landscape sharpens in detail: sloping hills neatly divided into green rectangles, evenly terraced to the top; single storey houses painted in bright red, blue or green and yellow, planted at the base of the hills.\n\nIn another couple of hours, women - with long cloths draped from their heads down their backs - would be dotting the terraced hills to handpick the first flush of tea leaves, following a tradition started over a century ago.\n\nNuwara Eliya, which used to be called Little England, is where the country's highest elevation tea plantations are and where much of the landscape and the rhythm of life has been unchanged since the time a Scot, James Taylor, introduced commercial tea planting in 1867.\n\nThe 1,868m-high locale yields the finest and most delicate variety of Sri Lanka's famed Orange Pekoe tea, out of the six types of tea - categorised from low country to high country teas - in the country. With its golden colour and distinct full-bodied flavour, and its artisanal processing, Ceylon tea is considered a premium brew in the world of teas.\n\nRight now, though, this sumptuous image of breaking dawn is enjoyed from Nuwara Eliya's only tea factory turned boutique hotel. Heritance Tea Factory Hotel has been converted from an actual tea factory built in the 1930s - the only hotel of its kind here. It enjoys an almost 100 per cent occupancy year-round for its 60-odd rooms - such is the allure of Nuwara Eliya, both for its tea estates and mountainous, English-countryside ambience where night temperatures drop below 20 degrees celsius.\n\nIn its tea factory days, the four floors of the Hethersett Tea Factory - whose teas were auctioned in Mincing Lane, London - held lines of troughs for the withering of freshly-plucked tea leaves. When it became a hotel, the walls of galvanised iron corrugated sheets were reinforced (the original beams are painted green, and the reinforcements red), so that the open floors could be partitioned into luxurious rooms. Some of the original machinery parts of the factory have been tastefully re-used as d\u00e9cor for the tea-themed look of the hotel. The hotel has even hosted a right royal guest: Britain's Prince Charles paid a visit in 1992 when it first opened.\n\nThe conversion is beautifully done, but what's more fascinating is the knowledge that there are more like it - hundreds around the country - which are still very much in operation, whetting your interest in just how the Sri Lankan tea industry works.\n\nFor an idea of what it means to wither leaves, and then crush, dry and sort them, visit the little showroom cottage on the hotel grounds which takes you through the tea production process. Or better still, arrange to visit one of the many plantations and tea factories in the highlands.\n\nFinlays is one of the bigger corporate plantations in Nuwara Eliya, and the factory still processes tea using orthodox methods. This means the additional crushing of tea leaves with a machine called the rotorvane, explains Lasantha Samarakoon, the superintendent of Finlays. \"It's like a beef mincer - crushing the tea so that the flavour is released,\" he explains. The other tea processing method is CTC (cut, tear and curl).\n\nWe dunk tea bags in hot water every time without giving it a second thought, and we've all also heard variations of the story of how tea was discovered (when a few leaves dropped into some Chinese emperor's cup of hot water and voila!), but modern day tea drinking, the beverage which helped build and bring down empires and industries, is not as easy as plucking and drying leaves and bagging them.\n\nTea processing is all about getting that balance of moisture in the leaves right, coaxing just enough of the flavour and tannin out. \"Once you harvest the leaves, the enzymic reaction begins,\" says Mr Samarakoon. After the plucking, the leaves are put in a trough and withered - by running hot air through them for a couple of hours - to remove about 80-90 per cent of the moisture so that the leaves' sap can be concentrated, otherwise it starts draining away.\n\nTea is plucked in the morning, and the processing starts by noon. The entire process of drying, cleaning and grading will be finished by 6am the next day - when the dried tea is stored into foiled paper sacks and is ready to be auctioned off in the next couple of weeks.\n\nEach tea plucker plucks 20kg of tea leaves a day, and they have to be the first flush - which is the bud and two leaves around it. \"Beyond the third leaf, it's not desirable for tea anymore,\" says Mr Samarakoon.\n\nThe whole agricultural and commercial management of tea plantations is an artful combination of science and maths. The interval for plucking for each bush is one week, for instance, because if a bush is over-plucked, then you're going to run out of bushes which need about two and a half months to grow to the next level. \"We want to leave four to five generations in a bush - that's the most cost-efficient,\" he adds.\n\nThe science and maths of tea processing is even more impressive when you learn about the lesser known art of blending and packaging. This we find out in Colombo, where tea is still sold through an efficient and transparent auction system - again a traditional system which continues to serve the country's tea industry well.\n\nEvery estate - there are some 600 in Sri Lanka - numbers its teas according to variants like plots and lines, because the terroir affects the bush, even on the same estate. And every week, almost 100 per cent of Sri Lanka's tea is sold in the tea auction held at the Sri Lanka Chambers of Commerce building.\n\nLike any art auction, the tea auctioneers rapidly rattle off lots and prices, and tea buyers, many of whom even don ties, sit in an amphitheatre-style lecture hall indicating their bids. Thousands of tea varieties are sold and bought each week, because almost every tea that we drink - regardless of brand or type - is a blend of two or more different leaves from different estates.\n\n\"We could blend something stronger with something lighter, to balance out the taste, or sometimes clients want a stronger colour, especially if they're drinking tea with milk,\" says Ranjith Gunathunge, one of the executives and tea tasters at Tea Tang Pvt Ltd.\n\nThe tea blenders at Tea Tang, owned by BP de Silva in Singapore, get close to 2,000 teas a week which they have to taste and then grade according to their standards. The tea blenders are also the ones who attend the tea auctions every week. Besides getting the right leaves for the blends they want - certain markets want teas with stronger colour, or more robust tastes - they also have to be sensitive to pricing. \"The auctions also mean that we generally know which markets other companies are catering to,\" explains Mr Gunathunge. Tea Tang blends and packages the teas sold by the Sri Lankan Tea Board, and its corporate client list includes Raffles Hotel in Singapore.\n\nSri Lanka is the only country where almost all of its teas are sold by auction, ensuring that the estates get the best prices for their teas. The industry is also the most well-regulated, and the system ensures that the estates get their money within a week of the auction. \"It's a highly transparent system that we have, and it rates as the largest in the world for a single origin,\" points out Hasitha De Alwis, director of the Sri Lanka Tea Promotion Board.\n\nTrundling back down from Nuwara Eliya to Colombo, on the very jam-packed roads and often caught behind a gaily-coloured Tata lorry, one can't help but marvel at how tea - the planting of it, its processing, and how it provides the country a strong export income - has shaped both the land and the economy of Sri Lanka since the mid-19th century.\n\nFormerly British plantations might now be owned by Sri Lankan corporates and the government (after a nationalisation exercise in the 1950s), but the plantations still retain their English estate names such as Hatton and Somerset, and the highlands, their English countryside character.\n\n\"Tradition is the most suitable word that can explain tea in the Sri Lankan context,\" pronounces Mr De Alwis, who had done much to promote the export of Ceylon teas since the 1970s. Now, against newer tea-producing countries such as Kenya which is able to use machines for the planting and plucking, Sri Lanka has to strive to add value to its handpicked teas - to make sure that the sun isn't yet setting on this industry which provides it both the hard income, but also the soft romance of a bygone era.\n\nuihoon@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the last survey, 60 per cent did.\n\nAsked how they thought their own business would fare next year, only 57 per cent said they expected it to grow, down from 74 per cent in the last survey.\n\nCPA Australia said in the survey report: \"The drop in confidence is a surprise, given that independent expert forecasts for the Singapore economy in 2014 are quite robust.\"\n\nIts chief executive Alex Malley attributed the significant dip in confidence levels to global economic volatility stemming from slower growth in China and other external factors.\n\nOf those who believed their business would grow, 62 per cent said the growth would come from increased sales; about a third said it would come from improvements to their business model.\n\nOn the other hand, businesses that do not expect to grow next year cited increasing costs and falling sales as factors.\n\nMr Malley said: \"While confidence is down, the sector seems to be showing enormous resilience, with more than a third of small businesses surveyed still saying they intend to add staff in 2014.\"\n\nIndeed, 35 per cent of small businesses say they are looking to hire next year; 52 per cent say no changes would be made to their headcount, and 7 per cent expect to trim their employee numbers.\n\nBusiness priorities remain largely unchanged, with small businesses listing revenue growth, customer retention and new customer marketing as their top three priorities.\n\nAnother survey, the SME Development Survey released last week by DP Information Group, concluded that as more Singapore small businesses respond to the government's call for higher productivity, labour tightening and lower costs, realising their plans for revenue growth is going to get tricky.\n\nOnly 7 per cent of the sample in this survey of 10,000 small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs) expect to notch up double-digit growth. This is a record low in the 11 years the survey has been carried out.\n\nAnother 44 per cent expect flat growth.\n\nHo Meng Kit, chief executive officer of the Singapore Business Federation (SBF), said: \"It is quite clear that SMEs have been grappling with operational challenges as a result of tight manpower constraints and escalating business costs. Hence, in their day-to-day 'fire- fighting' mode, they have little bandwidth left to implement productivity improvements and plan for business expansion overseas.\n\n\"This has resulted in lower turnover and profitability.\"\n\nGan Kwok Yee, co-founder of cocktail bar Jigger & Pony, told The Business Times that escalating business costs in the next year are certainly a concern for small businesses.\n\nShe said an F&B business like hers faces mounting costs in shophouse rental and in wages from the tight labour market.\n\nHowever, she said the business has more control over its wage bill than its rental, \"by focusing on training and increasing our team's skillsets and productivity\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Distrust because there has been talk of these \"currencies\" being used to anonymously buy things such as guns and drugs from sites such as Silk Road and Black Market Reloaded. And disdain because peer-to- peer cryptocurrencies do not have a central bank backing their value. Bitcoins don't exist physically; they are just computer files, and algorithms have capped the total number of Bitcoins that can be \"mined\" by computers solving complex cyptographic problems at 21 million in order to prevent \"inflation\". Also, unlike real world coins, each Bitcoin can be \"broken\" down into 1,000 \"pieces\" for payment purposes.\n\nBitcoin was first \"developed\" in 2009 by a little- known cryptographer going by the name \"Nakamoto\". Its attraction is easy to understand. Existing online payment systems such as PayPal and credit cards always take a cut either from the buyer or seller.\n\nBitcoin looks attractive because there are no middlemen involved and hence no cuts. Bitcoin fans also celebrate the fact that there is no central bank-type authority regulating the currency. However, as a senior official of the Bank of England said recently, \"economies perform better when they have managed monetary policies\" that only a central bank can provide.\n\nBitcoin has a lot of potential if it can come out of the shadows. For example, it cannot be forged or stolen. However, for it to become mainstream, central bank authorities and Bitcoin supporters would have to develop a consensus on how it can be integrated into the global currency system. The US Senate recently held a series of hearings on Bitcoin to explore how federal regulators can oversee this new form of online payment and, if possible, co-opt it into the overall banking system. US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke has said that Bitcoin and its analogues \"may hold long-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system\". Richard Branson has announced that his commercial space company Virgin Galactic will accept Bitcoin for trips into space.\n\nDuring the hearings, US Senator Mark Warner observed that Bitcoin could \"dramatically transform\" the role of central banks. There are several exchanges where one can \"trade\" Bitcoin, with BTC China reported to be the world's biggest. Following the US Senate hearings and the statements from top bankers and officials, prices shot up to US$900 for one Bitcoin; early this year, one Bitcoin could be had for just US$40.\n\nSome analysts are talking in terms of the value hitting US$1,000. Singapore, with its status as an important global financial centre, will have to closely monitor these developments and start planning for ways to not only integrate Bitcoin, if needed, but also profit from the move. As technology trends go, things will move very fast if Bitcoin gets the blessing of the US Fed.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/property/different-shares-trust", "site_title": "Of different shares of trust", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nOf different shares of trust\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Nov 26, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT trades like a real estate investment trust (Reit), and often emulates its characteristics, but business trusts (BTs), sometimes loosely labelled the \"poorer cousin\" of Reits, operate very differently from Reits.\n\nBroadly speaking, the key differentiating factors between Reits and BTs lie in their development restriction, gearing limit, and minimum distribution payout.\n\nTaking development restriction as an example, Reits have a development cap of up to 10 per cent of its asset value. In addition, they have to maintain a minimum distribution of at least 90 per cent of distributable profits, which in turn grants the vehicle tax transparency. Finally, Reits have a gearing limit of 35 per cent of assets, and 60 per cent of assets if they have a credit rating.\n\nOn the other hand, BTs have no development restriction, gearing limit, or minimum distribution payout. Instead, these are bound by the trust deed, which many BTs have fashioned after Reits.\n\nCroesus Retail Trust, for instance, has a development limit of 20 per cent. The trust, which is the first Asia-Pacific retail business trust with an initial portfolio located in Japan, listed in May this year. It intends to distribute at least 90 per cent of its distributable income, and its asset leverage limit is set at 60 per cent.\n\nPerennial China Retail Trust on the other hand has undertaken to distribute at least 50 per cent of its distributable profit. Asset leverage limit has been set at 60 per cent of trust property; it does not have a development cap.\n\nIn these cases, the respective managers believe that having a higher development limit and higher gearing ratio would enable them to offer higher growth and upside through development.\n\nThe problem is that investors compare the yield of BTs with Reits, said Pua Seck Guan, executive director and chief executive of Perennial China Retail Trust Management.\n\n\"The problem we face today is that investors use yield to measure share price. So when you have development projects and you have growth, the market discounts it,\" said Mr Pua.\n\nDespite its apparent similarities - both distribute dividends on a regular basis - BTs were originally created to target infrastructure companies.\n\n\"The philosophy the regulator had when the BT regime was started, is to target infrastructure companies which have very high depreciation,\" said Tan Kok Huan, managing director, asset-backed structured products, capital markets group, at DBS Bank.\n\n\"If you stay as a company, you can pay very little dividends because the depreciation would eat into your profits. Companies won't pay more than accounting profits, as depreciation is an accounting expense. However, a trust allows you to pay more than accounting profits and that's one of the key advantages of BT,\" he said.\n\n\"At the end of the day, people looking at BT must understand and appreciate the underlying asset and business,\" he added. Interestingly, having a BT framework in tandem with a Reit framework is what enabled stapled hospitality trusts to list.\n\n\"(A) landmark project was in 2005, when we worked on the CDL Hospitality Trust. Reits are not supposed to have very operational assets. We studied how hotel Reits are structured in the US and had extensive discussions with regulators. In the end we chose a stapled structure, as we needed to consider the options available in the event there is no master lease,\" said Jerry Koh, partner at Allen & Gledhill LLP.\n\nHaving a BT stapled to the Reit allows the BT to hold and operate the assets, or have a master lease between the Reit and the BT and have the BT operate the assets.\n\n\"Being able to use the stapled structure enabled us to undertake hotel Reits . . . We created something that was unique in Singapore to allow the hotel structure. That was significant,\" he said.\n\nFor investors, knowing BTs from Reits, and discerning one type of Reit from another, is important.\n\nWhen investing in hospitality Reits, investors should look at the rental formula under which the Reit is getting its cash flows, said Galen Lee, managing director, head of South-east Asian real estate, at UBS Bank.\n\n\"The less variability in a hotel Reit's cash flows, for example by structuring a high fixed rent with a low variable rent component, the lower the risk in a hotel Reit. Conversely, a hotel Reit with a large proportion of cash flows tied to the operating performance of the underlying asset will be viewed by investors as being more risky,\" he said.\n\n\"Investors should also look at what the managers of stapled securities are looking to do in terms of undertaking more development activities or leverage via the business trust side of the business, as this may increase the risk profile of the vehicle.\"\n\nFor other Reits, investors should focus on the fundamental real estate portfolio, and take the mentality that they are buying a piece of real estate via the equity markets, said Mr Lee.\n\n\"For example, when property investors buy commercial properties they look at capitalisation rates (cap rates) as a key valuation metric,\" said Mr Lee.\n\nCap rate is the net property income divided by the purchase price of the assets.\n\nBut given that the markets value a Reit through the capital markets, it is possible to compute its implied cap rates by dividing the Reit's net property income over the sum of its equity market capitalisation plus its debt.\n\n\"This is because an investor who theoretically buys up all the Reit's units and all its debt will own all the financial claims on the underlying properties. Investors can then assess whether this implied cap rate is attractive relative to other Reits and whether it's in line with the cap rate prevalent for that asset class and geography,\" said Mr Lee.\n\nTaking this approach cuts through the differences between Reits, given that different Reits have different gearing levels, varying cost of debt, different fee regimes, income support and other structural differences. All of these factors impact a Reit's distribution yield and risk profile.\n\n\"Investors will therefore look at other factors than just a Reit's distribution yield when evaluating it.\n\nLikewise they will need to look beyond whether an acquisition is yield accretive, especially if it results in excessive leverage or if the target property is a higher risk market,\" added Mr Lee.\n\n\"Reits have no construction risk. They should be largely or fully leased out whereas a developer may end up building empty condos or offices and valuations can move quite sharply. So these two are very different animals. The fact that they are trading so closely means that investors are still seeing Reits as no different from a developer stock, which is not meant to be,\" said Wen Khai Meng, chief executive officer, CapitaLand Singapore.\n\n\"This is a problem to the extent that managers react to investor demand. I'm supposed to be an income-producing stock, but my shareholders insist I must grow, so you are forcing a camel to run like a horse.\n\n\"But people forget the risk (of Reits) is also lower as the leases are locked in at least for a period of time. People look at returns and they forget about the risk.\"\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nPRODUCTION TEAM:Mindy Tan and Ong Chor Hao (BT Newsdesk), Eugene Teo (BTDigital), Yvonne Poh (BT Subs Desk), Khairie Rahmat (BT Art), Yen Meng Jiin (BT Photo)\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

As at 2012, he held more than 20 per cent of Neptune, which in turn controlled 50 million shares of Blumont and a 1.7 per cent stake in LionGold. He declined to comment.\n\nMs Quah held a 2.15 per cent interest in Blumont as at March 18 and is chief executive of Ipco International, which held a 9.7 per cent stake in Blumont as at March 2013. Sun Spirit is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ipco and a stakeholder in both Blumont and LionGold. Ms Quah could not be reached for comment.\n\nMr Chen is director of business and corporate development at LionGold and is one of Asiasons' largest shareholders, with a 2.09 per cent stake as at March 28, 2013.\n\nInteractive Brokers' case is the latest shot to be fired in the wake of October's penny sell-off, when sudden drops in the share prices of Asiasons, Blumont and LionGold on Oct 4 led to rare intervention measures by the Singapore Exchange and a subsequent run on small counters.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Singapore Exchange have said they are reviewing the circumstances surrounding the trading of those stocks.\n\nDays after her assets were frozen, Ms Quah on Nov 20 filed a suit in the United Kingdom against Goldman Sachs International, claiming that the bank had been unreasonable in how it demanded the repayment of a $61 million loan facility for which her holdings in the three stocks had been pledged as collateral.\n\nAccording to UK court documents that BT saw, Ms Quah said about 28 million of her Asiasons shares and 29 million of her LionGold shares had been force-sold from Oct 2 to 23 for a total of $19.4 million.\n\nBlumont executive director James Hong Gee Ho and LionGold independent director Ng Su Ling have also filed suits in the UK against Goldman on allegations similar to Ms Quah's. Neither could be reached for comment.\n\nMs Quah and Mr Hong are represented by barristers' chambers Thirty Nine Essex Street.\n\nGoldman Sachs declined to comment.\n\nShares in Asiasons closed flat at 13.5 cents yesterday. Blumont slipped 0.9 per cent, or 0.1 cent, to close at 10.8 cents, while LionGold added 2.3 per cent, or 0.4 cent, to head out at 18.1 cents. Innopac gained 3.1 per cent, or 0.1 cent, for a 3.3 cent close.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Nonetheless, he treats each one like it were his first because every joint project is a valuable opportunity to breed \"creative thinking and interesting new music\".\n\nThis time, he is working with jazz musicians from Russia, for the Russia-Singapore Jazz Symphonia which will run at the 700-seater concert hall at School of the Arts (SOTA) later tonight.\n\nIt all began when he was commissioned to put together a jazz concert by a Russian businessman named Evgeny Tugolukov.\n\nThe latter had befriended Monteiro at one of his concerts about a 11/2 years ago, and later introduced him to some of the top jazz musicians in Russia when Monteiro visited Moscow earlier this year.\n\n\"At first, I thought to do a jazz concert, but then I thought why not do one that's half symphonic jazz instead, since that's something rarely or probably never even heard of in Singapore,\" says Monteiro.\n\nSo for the first half of the concert, the jazz musicians on stage will be joined by a full symphonic orchestra to play some improvised jazz music.\n\nThe line-up includes three of Monteiro's original pieces - Overture in C, Olympia, and Another Time, Another Place - as well as a nine-part symphonic suite by Russian composer Enri Lolashvilli titled Nostalgia.\n\nAs for the second half, Monteiro has decided to stick to a more traditional jazz concert format, where his quartet will take the stage with two Russian jazz musicians and play a mixture of five or six jazz compositions. One of the two musicians is famed Russian trumpeter Vadim Eilenkrig, while the other is saxophonist Igor Butman, whom former American president Bill Clinton once commented \"may be the greatest living jazz saxophone player, who happens to be a Russian\".\n\nWhen asked why these two musicians were picked above all the other jazz players out there, Monteiro explains: \"We (jazz musicians) all aspire to the geniune standard set by New York and American jazz musicians for all their years, and we all aspire to play authentically.\n\n\"These musicians, they are very authentic... and they play at a level that's comparable to New York - the mecca of jazz,\" says Monteiro.\n\nThe Russia-Singapore Jazz Symphonia runs tonight at 8pm at the SOTA Concert Hall.

And I remember the modern designs that coexist with traditional architecture, but I don't remember all these high-rise buildings. I remember how clean Singapore was, and how I thought Changi Airport was the most beautiful airport I've personally ever been in.\"\n\nJust earlier this week, Dr Ward-Steinman finally made his long-awaited trip back to Singapore, for the world premiere of his 2012 composition titled Singapore Sonorama, at the Esplanade Concert Hall.\n\nThe 16-minute commissioned piece with four parts honours different elements of Singapore - the Merlion, Malay culture and folk song Dayung Sampan, Little India and the music of tabla drums, and finally Chinatown. The work is part of a concert titled Circus Maximus by the local wind orchestra The Philharmonic Winds, which started in 2000 and currently has over 50 active members. Circus Maximus is titled after a 35-minute composition of the same name, by American composer John Corgliano. The piece is also known as Symphony No 3 for Large Wind Ensemble, and is made up of eight movements in total.\n\nIt was written with the composer's intention to give audiences a \"surround sound\" experience, says conductor Leonard Tan, who is also the music director of The Philharmonic Winds. Hence, musicians will be positioned not just onstage but off as well. \"Just planning this particular concert took a lot of logistics, and I think that has taken more energy and time than the rehearsals themselves,\" says Dr Tan.\n\nIn addition to a the full-sized wind band on stage, there will be 12 trumpeters sitting among the audience around the concert hall, a saxophone quartet and double bass at circle one, two horns on circle two, as well as two percussionists plus a clarinet at circle three. Not to mention the marching band that's scheduled to come in at one point of the show. \"It's experimental, yes, but we've done experimental works before.

The 38-year-old was driving home one night while listening to the BBC World Service radio station, when a short blurb came on about a man in Berlin who had been cured of HIV.\n\n\"It made me wonder if I had just heard a fictional story. He almost seemed like a mythical creature of sorts. So I called my old friend (Dzul Sungit) who lives in Rotterdam, and I said I'm coming to Berlin. I don't know why, I just want to find out more about The Berlin Patient,\" says Tang, a trained filmmaker who is currently a producer at HBO Asia.\n\nSo a few months later, he hopped on a plane to Berlin, and began a journey that would eventually result in his upcoming documentary, I Hugged The Berlin Patient.\n\nThe film premieres next Monday at The Grand Cathay, and standard tickets are priced at $30, while VIP tickets are $100. All net proceeds will be donated to Action for AIDS.\n\nThe Berlin Patient refers to Timothy Ray Brown, who was cured of HIV in Berlin in 2007. The bone marrow transplants that were meant to treat his acute myeloid leukaemia ended up getting rid of his HIV as well.\n\nUp till 2010, no one even knew his name, because Brown was an extremely private person, says Tang. So when they first got to Berlin, they didn't do it with the intention of putting together a documentary at all.\n\n\"My co-director, Dzul, said he was just going to roll the camera, and if I was not interesting, he would stop rolling. But he never did,\" says Tang, who is currently in his sixth year of remission from Hodgkin's lymphoma - cancer of the lymph nodes.\n\n\"When we arrived in Berlin, we didn't know people, we didn't know the language, we basically funded it ourselves. It was really a leap of faith of some kind... But we realised that, at worst, nothing would happen and we would have a holiday,\" he adds.\n\nAnd during that first week, things did not go very smoothly. Tang spent most of his time walking around the city wearing a placard with the German words \"Wissen sie, wer The Berlin Patient ist\" or \"Do you know who The Berlin Patient is?\", and he grew increasingly frustrated when no one seemed to have heard of this elusive man.\n\n\"But one day something happened, and it all kind of fell into place suddenly. I remember it was on a day that was quite auspicious, the 10th of October, so like a perfect 10,\" he laughs.\n\n\"Certain things happened. Whoever we wanted to get in touch with somehow got back to us, so we realised we couldn't stop rolling.\"\n\nThough Tang refuses to reveal too many details about the rest of his journey, the title of the film already gives away the ending - that he did get to meet the man in the end, after a few months of searching, a lot of faith, and help from kind strangers in a foreign land.\n\nI Hugged The Berlin Patient may sound like a potentially preachy, video-version of a motivational speech, but Tang insists that the last thing he wants is for his audience to spend the hour and a half in tears. Instead, he hopes the film will come across as quirky and light-hearted.\n\n\"It's not disease-specific. It's just about hope. It's just watching something uplifting. It's not as heavy as some people think because it's set against the backdrop of a medical, HIV or cancer thing. It's not heavy at all. And it's in that sense very Singaporean and global in its theme,\" says Tang.\n\nrachloi@sph.com.sg\n\nThe world charity premiere of I Hugged The Berlin Patient runs on Dec 2 at 8.30pm at The Grand Cathay.

The Japanese capital's properties also stand to receive a windfall of about 152 billion yen from the 2020 Olympic Games, according to International Olympic Committee.\n\n\"Investor perception of Japan Excellent's profitability is improving in tandem with the office space market,\" said Mikio Namiki, an analyst at Mizuho Securities Co in Tokyo. \"The bonds are also offering a spread that is quite attractive to investors which have seen yield premiums decline across the board.\"\n\nThe spread on the Tokyo-based Reit's 1.01 per cent notes due 2016 dropped 28 basis points since the offering in October 2011 to 20 basis points. Japan Credit Rating Agency Ltd ranks the company AA-, its fourth-highest investment grade. The spread for Japan's similarly-rated issuers plunged 36 to seven in the period, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show.\n\nJapan Excellent has 29 billion yen of bonds outstanding, including 12 billion yen maturing in March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund's weighted average fixed coupon declined to 1.2 per cent from 1.45 per cent in the last quarter of 2010, the data show.\n\n\"The overall office market is improving which is positive for the Reit market,\" said Kenta Anami, general manager at the finance and accounting department of Japan Excellent. \"We refinanced the debt earlier because we see now as a good timing.\"\n\nMr Abe's economic stimulus campaign includes monetary stimulus to encourage finance activity. Stepped-up borrowing by Japanese companies has to translate into increased capital spending for the measures to succeed in ending deflation and reviving the economy.\n\nThe volume of real estate transactions in Tokyo jumped 58 per cent to US$15.6 billion in the first nine months of this year, according to a report by Jones Lang LaSalle. That's US$400 million short of New York, which ranked second with US$16 billion after a 16 per cent decline. Paris was fourth with US$10.9 billion, while London topped the list with US$23.2 billion.\n\nTokyo's office vacancy rate, a measurement of unoccupied space, dropped to 7.56 per cent last month from 7.9 per cent in September and was at its lowest since June 2009, according to broker Miki Shoji Co. The gauge reached a record 9.43 per cent in June 2012.\n\nCommercial land values in Japan's three biggest metropolitan areas rose for the first time since 2008 this year, gaining 0.6 per cent, according to the land ministry's annual land survey report released in September.\n\nJapan's property-related securities may also receive an infusion from the country's pension assets. An expert panel recommended that the 121 trillion yen Government Pension Investment Fund diversify its investments into other financial products, including Reits, where returns may be higher than on local sovereign bonds, according to a report released by the advisory group on Nov 20.\n\n\"We see a growing possibility of GPIF investment in Reits via baby funds with outsourced specialist management,\" Tomohiro Araki, a Tokyo-based senior analyst at Nomura Securities Co, wrote in a report on the same day. The pension fund's Reit investment would help lift land values, Mr Araki said in the report.\n\nJapan Hotel Reit Investment Corp raised 2.5 billion yen of 0.89 per cent bonds due 2016, at a yield premium of 60 basis point over the yen swap rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. JCR has an A rating on the fund, its fifth-lowest investment grade.\n\n\"Hotel assets tend to be riskier than offices,\" prompting investors to seek higher returns, said Roko Izawa, a Tokyo-based analyst at Standard & Poor's. \"There are operational risks such as fluctuation in occupancy rate and seasonality.\"\n\nJapan Retail Fund Investment Corp, Japan's third-biggest Reit, said on Nov 22 it hired Mitsubishi UFJ, Morgan Stanley Securities Co and Mizuho Securities Co to handle a 10-year bond sale. The fund last offered debt in 2007.\n\n\"A majority of Japan's Reits have recently had their cost of debt reduced because of an improving market condition,\" S&P's Mr Izawa said. \"They want to lock down the cost of funding because the outlook for interest rates is not clear. They want to be prepared.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

He added that, apart from product quality, \"we're also convinced our local presence makes all the difference to success: REC is excellently positioned to serve the local market, having established its own factory at the centre of the action - right in Singapore - to produce high-performing solar panels for the Asia region.\"\n\nREC's integrated plant here produces the complete wafer, cell and solar panels, and is the group's only remaining solar panel facility since it shut its entire Norwegian manufacturing operations last year due to global overcapacity and falling demand.\n\nLast month, REC effectively split into two companies: REC Solar, comprising its solar panel operations and distribution, is headquartered in Singapore, while REC Silicon, producing advanced silicon materials for customers in the solar and electronics industry, has its HQ in the US.\n\nREC said that at Sheng Siong's Mandai distribution centre, its solar panels will cover 11,000 square metres of the rooftop and create a 1.2MW power plant that will generate enough energy to meet at least 11 per cent of the facility's electricity needs. It will also offset at least 730 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.\n\nAt the Singapore Sports Hub, its 7,000 sq m of rooftop installation will not only produce solar energy, but act as a sunshade for the roof, thus reducing the heat conducted to the building. \"The system will generate over 919,100 kWh of energy every year, enough for approximately 183 Singapore households, and will mitigate around 459 tonnes of CO2 annually,\" it added.\n\nThe facility will reap tremendous benefits from the 25-year power output warranty of the REC solar panels, said Mr Grar\u00e9. \"Thanks to the reliability of REC solar panels, Phoenix Solar can guarantee the Sports Hub stable electricity prices over a time horizon of over 20 years, with no upfront investment.\"\n\nBy year-end, total solar capacity here is set to double to 20MW or more. And with Singapore moving to incorporate solar energy into the power system, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) is raising the current cap on intermittent generation sources (including from solar) from 350MW currently to 600MW (representing 10 per cent of current peak electricity demand here) as a first step.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The government had pinned its hopes on offsetting those losses with record 22.3 per cent growth from January to October in tourism, a sector accounting for 9 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), and big infrastructure spending.\n\nThat could be wishful thinking. About 16 billion baht (S$626 million) has been lost through holiday cancellations this month alone, just as peak season begins, says the Tourism Ministry.\n\nThe protests could also add to delays in the injection of two trillion baht into the economy through infrastructure projects that have been on ice for months, bogged down in legal limbo from an opposition party challenge.\n\n\"Real concerns come via further delays in infrastructure spending and impact on tourism, the two most likely drivers of Thai GDP next year,\" Credit Suisse economist Santitarn Sathirathai wrote in a research note. \"These two components are likely to be sensitive to political and government stability,\" he said, adding that a snap election could return a weaker coalition that would struggle even more to push through big spending plans.\n\nThe baht, now the fourth-weakest in Asia, is another factor. Even before the protests, it looked vulnerable to the US Federal Reserve's expected winding down of its US$85 billion a month monetary stimulus measures.\n\nThe monthly correlation between the baht and two-year US Treasury yields has been at record highs, which means the currency already looks ripe for a fall when the Fed eases its stimulus measures. So foreign investors who poured into Thailand over the past six months as they avoided more troubled markets such as Indonesia and India now have two reasons to leave: higher US rates and domestic political concern.\n\nBut political turmoil isn't always a drag on the economy which has weathered eight years of on-off chaos. Each time, Thailand's financial markets typically swoon and rebound.\n\nThe bloodiest political violence in a generation erupted in April and May 2010, but foreign inflows nearly doubled that year; stocks rocketed 40.6 per cent and the economy bounded ahead by 7.8 per cent, its best growth in 15 years. Private investment jumped 14 per cent and exports rose nearly 30 per cent. Tourists returned to Thai beaches in near-record numbers, up 12 per cent that year.\n\n\"The majority of foreign investments are not in Bangkok,\" said Teeranan Srihong, president of Kasikornbank pcl, referring to the manufacturers at the heart of Thailand's economy whose factories stud surrounding provinces. \"Thailand will be an attractive destination for foreign investors over the long term.\" Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

With this scheme, IE Singapore will help local companies become more globally competitive by boosting access to liquidity to help support new business ventures in less familiar, possibly riskier markets.\"\n\nIt will be IE Singapore's first scheme to address the non-payment risks of overseas issuing banks.\n\nCredit guarantees are currently issued by multilateral development banks such as ADB against non-payment risks by banks in emerging markets. Such guarantees are used by Singapore-based banks to provide financing to Singapore companies trading with buyers from emerging markets.\n\nIE Singapore said Singapore is the single biggest beneficiary of the ADB-TFP. The volume of Singapore trades backed under the initiative has jumped nearly 400 per cent since 2010, hitting a record US$1.7 billion last year.\n\nBut the guarantees have not been enough to meet market demand because of credit limits.\n\nThe situation is also not helped by the stricter banking rules introduced following the global financial crisis, which makes banks even warier of risks, said Swiss Re's head of credit & surety, Andreas Hillebrand.\n\nSteven Beck, ADB's head of finance, said so far ADB-TFP, which was started in 2007, has not seen a default under its scheme.\n\nIE Singapore said the risks of dealing with banks in emerging markets tend to be harder to assess, which \"can be a real constraint to trade\". At the same time, it noted that the Republic's trade with the emerging markets has been growing three times faster than its trade with the advanced economies.\n\nThe TFS will address market gaps in trade financing for Singapore companies in emerging markets, IE Singapore said.\n\n\"Under this scheme, IE Singapore will share the risk on credit guaranteed and provided against non-payment risks of overseas issuing banks with the ADB and Swiss Re,\" it said. \"This in turn facilitates Singapore exporters' receipt of payments for transactions with buyers from emerging markets.\"\n\nMr Seow said IE Singapore is teaming up with ADB and Swiss Re in the scheme because it saves the trade promotion agency the trouble of starting one afresh.\n\nThe partnership is also part of Singapore's move to anchor and expand the presence of agencies and firms such as ADB and Swiss Re here, which will benefit Singapore's economy, he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Also names positioned to capitalise on structural industry upcycles are Golden Agri-Resources Ltd and Jardine Cycle & Carriage.\n\nStocks to avoid are Indofood Agri Ltd, OCBC Bank and Far East Hospitality Trust.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The report said this reflected the better-educated profile of recent cohorts of older residents and tripartite efforts to better equip them to continue working.\n\nProfessionals, managers and executives (PMEs) also account for a bigger share of the resident workforce as the education and skills profile of the workforce improves. PMEs make up 31.1 per cent of the resident workforce this year, up from 27.4 per cent a decade ago.\n\nThe report said full-time working residents' nominal median monthly income jumped 6.5 per cent over the year to $3,705 in June. Real median income growth picked up from 2.5 per cent in 2012 to a preliminary 3.9 per cent this year, as inflation eased. \"Cumulatively, the median income (including employer CPF contributions) of full-time employed residents rose by 27.9 per cent or 5 per cent per annum from 2008 to 2013,\" the report said.\n\nIn real terms, median income grew by an estimated 9.7 per cent or 1.9 per cent yearly in this period, faster than the 7 per cent or 1.4 per cent annually in 2003-2008.\n\nThe increase over the decade was a preliminary 17.4 per cent, or 1.6 per cent yearly.\n\nThe report said income growth at the 20th percentile broadly kept pace with that of the median in the recent five years, with the former's monthly income jumping 26.6 per cent from $1,489 in 2008 to $1,885 in 2013, or 4.8 per cent yearly.\n\nThe real increase is an estimated 8.6 per cent, or 1.7 per cent yearly.\n\n\"This outweighed the real income losses of 0.6 per cent or 0.1 per cent per annum from 2003 to 2008, resulting in growth of 7.9 per cent or 0.8 per cent per annum over the decade,\" the report said.\n\nNoting that the median real wage growth was 1.9 per cent a year in 2008-2013, against 1.7 per cent for lower-income workers, Mr Heng said: \"We must push harder to improve their (lower-income workers') wages faster and sustainably.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/theres-potential-lower-utility-costs", "site_title": "There's potential for lower utility costs", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nThere's potential for lower utility costs\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Nov 28, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT is heartening that electricity rates here, both for homes and industries, have eased by some 10 per cent according to industry estimates, thanks largely to the intense competition among gencos, all under different owners, including foreign ones. Increased power supplies, including recently started liquefied natural gas imports, have helped.\n\nBut LNG supplies per se have not directly impacted power prices. It is just that Brent crude prices, to which LNG supplies are pegged, have eased recently. PNG prices, on the other hand, are pegged to high sulphur fuel oil prices. Simply put, consumers here have since July been paying for power generated using both PNG and LNG feedstock, which means they bought power on the back of a \"blended\" or combined PNG/LNG price.\n\nPower aside, there is however, still the bugbear of other costly utilities, such as steam, needed by the petroleum/chemical plants on Jurong Island. Unlike in the case of electricity, such utilities, including cooling water, cannot be transported over long distances. There are also a limited number of such utility players on the island, with dedicated supply pipelines tying them to their respective customers, and vice-versa. From just Sembcorp originally, recent new suppliers of steam and other utilities like cooling water there are YTL PowerSeraya and Tuas Power, the latter from its new clean coal/biomass complex.\n\nAs utilities account for a big chunk of operational costs, big users such as the mega petrochemical/refinery complexes of Shell and ExxonMobil, have resorted to building in-house utilities plants. Recent complaints of costly utilities have come from European producers to Japanese ones, with the latter claiming they are paying even more here than back home.\n\nBut the gencos' counter is that they are simply passing through their higher fuel costs. Utility costs here are higher relative to other countries because the latter have access to either natural energy resources or cheaper energy feedstock. Unlike say, some bigger Asian consumers, Singapore is just too small a buyer to be able to negotiate or exact lower gas prices from its suppliers. The Republic also does not have other renewables such as solar power, or nuclear, in its energy mix at this point to help it reduce costs.\n\nStill, with natural gas currently the dominant feedstock accounting for 86 per cent of power/utility production here, any attempts at reducing utility costs will, for now, have to centre around the fuel. The growth of a LNG hub here, with potential for cheaper spot cargoes; supply contracts priced off gas indices rather than current oil-based ones; plus new potential cheaper supply sources such as US shale projects, could help. Singapore's attempt, through Temasek-owned Pavilion Energy, to be involved in every aspect of the global gas trade, including directly in the gas fields, is also promising.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By and large, the departure of the retail investor in droves over the past six weeks - possibly because confidence has taken a hard knock following what has become known as the \"penny stock saga\" - and the draining of liquidity out of the local market that started six months ago because of US tapering fears seem to have knocked life out of the stock market.\n\nThis made for another largely featureless week, one in which dealers found themselves having to trade on their own in order to try and supplement declining incomes, or sit there and stare at the trading screen while waiting for inspiration that never came.\n\nBlue chips epitomised the slowing the market is experiencing - the Straits Times Index (STI) yesterday fell 10.02 points to 3,176.35, reversing almost all of Thursday's gains. The index rose four points for the week; for the year to date, it is up nine points.\n\nBanks led Thursday's bounce together with Jardine Matheson and Jardine Strategic. Yesterday, losses recorded by the two Jardine heavyweights took 1.3 points off the STI, while falls in United Overseas Bank and OCBC Bank took a further six points.\n\nTrading in the latter part of the week was affected by the closure of Wall Street for Thanksgiving on Thursday. Liquidity has been a problem for many weeks now - in yesterday's session though, 1.5 billion units worth $1.1 billion were done, a modest improvement over Thursday's $692 million.\n\nActivity in penny stocks has dropped off just as sharply. According to conventional market wisdom, the loss of interest in low-priced issues started in early October when the trio of Asiasons, Blumont and LionGold crashed 90 per cent in a day and were suspended by Singapore Exchange, then classified as designated securities. Upon relisting, they popped back into play before having the brakes slammed on them when regulators announced they were investigating trades in the trio.\n\nStill, despite the sharp drop-off in penny activity, there were bright spots. Mermaid Maritime, for example, saw its shares rise four cents over the week to 41 cents. The offshore oil and gas firm on Wednesday announced that net profit for the year ended September almost quadrupled to US$15.4 million from a year earlier.\n\nDealers have also singled out Keppel Corp as being a relative outperformer, holding steady in the face of overall weakness. It rose three cents to $11.31 yesterday and is up 69 cents or 6.5 per cent for the year.\n\nIn its Strategy 2014 report yesterday, OCBC Investment Research said the outlook was slowly and gradually improving.\n\n\"The recent 3Q13 corporate results in Singapore also point to a cautiously optimistic guidance from companies and high single-digit earnings growth is likely for 2014,\" said the broker. \"The Singapore market, based on the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI), is currently trading at 13.7x FY14 earnings and we believe this is reasonable. The recent historical PER (2007-now) ranges from as low as 9x during the 2008 financial crisis to as high as 18x, but the average is hovering slightly above 14x. In addition, price-to-book is not demanding at 1.35x and average dividend yield is decent at 3.3 per cent.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Apparently it's not that big a deal if you happen to be one of the hundreds of people who have booked the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class.\n\nDaimler South-east Asia, the distributor of Mercedes-Benz, would not confirm the number, but BT understands that close to 400 orders have been taken for the latest version of its flagship luxury limousine.\n\nTo be launched to 1,000 guests here tomorrow, the three available variants for now - the S350 CDI, S400 Hybrid, S500 - are priced between $450,000 and $600,000 (including COE) approximately.\n\nInterestingly, a surprisingly sizeable number of the higher-end S500 model with a V8 engine has been snapped up - one-quarter of all bookings compared to less than 10 per cent previously.\n\n\"This group of customers has seen their wealth grow exponentially because of asset inflation, so $500,000 is not considered a major expense,\" said one observer. \"But not only Singaporeans have benefited; it's a worldwide phenomenon.\"\n\nBut in Singapore the price of an S-Class can be almost treble because of the progressive registration tax structure introduced in February this year. And along with the vehicle financing restrictions implemented at the same time, buyers have to stump up about $250,000 in cash because of the 50 per cent cash downpayment required for cars with an open market value of more than $20,000.\n\nThis is unlikely to be a problem for S-Class buyers, however, who traditionally include owners of small and medium-sized enterprises, and CEOs and the top management of MNCs and other corporations.\n\n\"For some of them, the S-Class is a car that they must have because of its branding and status,\" said the observer. \"Its reputation is such that it is the undisputed champ in this segment when it comes to comfort and luxury.\"\n\nPart of its large clientele and loyal following can be attributed to the fact that the S-Class was one of the earliest full-sized luxury saloons to go on sale in Singapore. It gained popularity among the well-heeled as the Mercedes-Benz 280S in the 1960s, at a time when there was virtually no competition as a status symbol in its class.\n\nIn its run-out year this year, the S-Class notched up sales of only 88 units in the first nine months, compared with its traditional rival, the BMW 7 Series, of which 209 units were registered in the same period, while the corresponding figure for the Audi A8 was 38 units.\n\nLast year, about 350 units of the S-Class were sold, and at its peak, this outgoing model racked up sales of 850 units in 2007, one year after its launch.\n\nIn general, launches of popular makes and models in Singapore tend to elicit a good response despite the prohibitive taxes and high COE premiums.\n\nIt is said that the Lexus ES mid-sized luxury sedan, for example, managed to net more than 100 bookings nearly two months ago at its introduction, while the facelifted Mercedes-Benz E-Class found favour with slightly more buyers when it was introduced in March.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the region, 55 per cent of companies said they would focus on growth over the next 12 months, compared to 39 per cent in April.\n\nSentiment in the rest of the world seemed to be in sync, with 56 per cent in Singapore and 57 per cent globally also focused on growth.\n\nAcquisitions are also gaining prominence. Forty- one per cent of South-east Asian companies expect to pursue acquisition over the next 12 months, from 29 per cent in April.\n\nSingapore is one of the most eager markets in the region for acquiring, with 50 per cent of respondents looking at acquisitions, compared to 44 per cent six months ago.\n\nSingapore companies were looking most at China, Myanmar, India, Vietnam and Indonesia. Companies from Australia, the United States, Thailand, the United Kingdom and India are most interested in acquiring in Singapore.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

What is missing is the whole ecosystem. We have our network (and) our understanding of customers.\"\n\nStarHub's approach stands in marked contrast to rival SingTel's, which has busied itself with buyouts, from the US$321 million takeover of mobile ad firm Amobee to its $12 million purchase of HungryGoWhere.\n\nInstead, StarHub will use the partnership approach on multiple levels, spreading the start-up load among app developers, VC funds and higher education institutions. Its e-book venture, Booktique, was also a result of a partnership, Mr Tan said. Now, StarHub plans to focus on applications that address the increasing overlap between the home and office space, as well as on the retail and hospitality sectors.\n\nWhile StarHub still co-invests in start-ups, it plans to offer other forms of support as well, especially through the MediaHub building, which is scheduled for completion in Q1 2016 and has an estimated gross floor area of 21,400 sq m. Space will be allocated to start-ups that need room to incubate their ideas. \"All start-ups need Internet service (and) mobile services, so we can give them support in terms of infrastructure,\" Mr Tan said.\n\nElsewhere in the MediaHub, StarHub will house other facilities critical for its push into relatively uncharted territory - a social media analytics lab, big data platform and an \"adaptive\" production studio. There, StarHub hopes to refine features that will keep its pay-TV customers loyal in an age where television content is increasingly fragmented and available for free.\n\nThe key to remaining relevant, Mr Tan believed, is interactivity. \"People still like to watch things at the same time but the problem is that there is no conversation,\" he said. The conversations being analysed by the social media lab will help to shape \"live\" TV production in MediaHub's studio.\n\nOn the hardware end, the MediaHub will house a new central office - an exchange facility - for StarHub in 2016. It will be the telco's first in the western region, which will join the existing ones in the central and eastern parts of Singapore.\n\nMinister for Communications and Information Yaacob Ibrahim was the guest of honour at the groundbreaking ceremony.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We had a lot of assets on our balance sheets and our debt was relatively high. From a developer's perspective, we want to go for an asset light model and create a stream of management fee income,\" said Wen Khai Meng, chief executive at CapitaLand Singapore.\n\nSPT faced a host of challenges from the onset however. This included constraints within the regulatory framework, tax transparency issues, and overcoming market perception of its viability.\n\nThe final blow came during SPT's IPO, when out of the 530 million units offered to the public, only 80 per cent were subscribed for. SPT's flotation was thus cancelled.\n\nUpon returning to the drawing board, the team realised that extensive education exercises for investors and the articulation of a business and growth strategy would be crucial.\n\nAddressing the question of total returns was key, said retail mall veteran Pua Seck Guan, who was then chief executive officer of the manager of the SPT, and later CapitaMall Trust Management.\n\nOne of the actions taken by the management involved freeing up some 50,000 sq ft from Junction 8's entire office tower and transferring it to its lower retail levels. This translated to rentals increasing by four or five times.\n\nThe term \"decanting\" was thus coined, as was the term \"asset enhancement initiative\" (AEI). Both terms are now used frequently within the industry.\n\nIndeed, the Reit platform instilled a form of discipline in the management team, forcing them to continuously look to their real estate to generate value for their shareholders, said Mr Pua.\n\nWhen the restructured CapitaMall Trust (CMT) returned to the market eight months later, it successfully raised $379 million as the first S-Reit listing.\n\nSignificantly, the Reit was complemented by a favourable tax ruling by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS), which stated that Reits did not have to pay taxes at the vehicle level if it distributed a minimum of 90 per cent of its distributable profit.\n\nIt is also worth pointing out that CapitaLand, as the sponsor of CMT, was committed to the Reit's growth, said Tan Kok Huan, managing director, asset-backed structured products, capital markets group, at DBS Bank.\n\nIn addition to seeding the Reit with properties that had asset enhancement potential, CapitaLand supported CMT in its acquisition of IMM from a third party by providing a backstop. This meant that if CMT was unable to get unitholders to approve the fundraising, CapitaLand would backstop and acquire the property, thus giving CMT the certainty to bid for the property.\n\nCMT paved the way for other Reits. Since its listing, the market has moved from one milestone to another, including the first S-Reit with foreign assets in 2003 (Fortune Reit), the first commercial Reit listing in 2004 (CapitaCommercial Trust), the first business trust in 2006 (Pacific Shipping Trust), and the first stapled-security, CDL Hospitality Trust in 2006.\n\nToday, Singapore is Asia's largest Reit market excluding Japan, with market capitalisation having grown 32 times from 2003.\n\nPRODUCTION TEAM:Mindy Tan and Ong Chor Hao (BT Newsdesk), Eugene Teo (BTDigital), Yvonne Poh (BT Subs Desk), Khairie Rahmat (BT Art), Yen Meng Jiin (BT Photo)\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

The strong demand allowed it to price the five-year sukuks tighter with a profit rate of 3.039 per cent. Islamic bonds do not allow interest.\n\n\"It was priced tighter because of support from sukuk and traditional bond investors,\" the source said.\n\nThe sukuk was sold in the Middle East, Europe and Asia.\n\nNet proceeds from the sale of the sukuk will be used by Ooredoo for general corporate purposes, including re-financing existing indebtedness.\n\nBookrunners for the deal are DBS Bank, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, QInvest and QNB Capital.\n\nDBS's ties with Ooredoo go back to 2009 when it became the only Asian bank to underwrite Qatar Telecom's inaugural US dollar bond issue. It was then the first international bond deal for a telecommunications company out of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states.\n\nQatar Telecom rebranded Qtel as Ooredoo in February this year. Ooredoo, which means \"I want\" in Arabic, is the biggest phone operator in Qatar, the host of the 2022 soccer World Cup.\n\nOoredoo has stakes in Singapore's Asia Mobile Holdings (AMH) and Indonesia's Indosat.\n\nOoredoo has a 25 per cent stake in AMH, with the remainder owned by Singapore Technologies Telemedia (STT). AMH, incorporated in 2007, is the preferred investment vehicle for both Ooredoo and STT for investing in mobile operations in the Asia Pacific region, according to Ooredoo's website.\n\nAMH has a 56.55 per cent stake in StarHub, which equates to an Ooredoo effective stake of 14.14 per cent.\n\nReports said that a lot hinged on how Ooredoo's inaugural sukuk sale went, and some Qatari companies can now be expected to proceed with fund-raising given the strong interest from investors.\n\nQatar's government and companies are tapping debt markets as the nation embarks on US$138 billion of investments by 2016, said a Bloomberg report.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/first-dbs-basel-iii-securities-achieve-800m-target", "site_title": "First DBS Basel-III securities achieve $800m target", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nFirst DBS Basel-III securities achieve $800m target\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Nov 26, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nDBS Group Holdings' first Basel III issue - non-cumulative, non-convertible perpetual capital securities callable in 2019 - has achieved the target issue size of $800 million.\n\nStrong interest enabled the issue to be priced at an initial distribution rate of 4.7 per cent, the lower end of the tender range, the bank said yesterday.\n\nThe perpetuals were offered in exchange via a tender for an outstanding $1.7 billion 4.7 per cent preference shares issued in 2010.\n\nIn the tender offer announced on Nov 7, the preference share holders were asked to opt for an initial distribution rate of between 4.7 and 4.9 per cent for the perpetuals.\n\nDBS said: \"This first-of-its kind tender offer was designed to help the DBS Group transition to the new Basel III regulatory capital rules, under which the existing preference shares no longer fully qualify as Tier 1 capital of DBS Bank.\"\n\nUnder Basel III rules, bank investors must share the burden in the event of a bank failure before public money is used to rescue the bank, which means that the perpetuals have a loss-absorbing feature.\n\nAt the close of the tender offer at 5pm last Thursday, applications amounting to about $1.1 billion had been received, exceeding the $800 million target size. DBS will accept all valid tenders at the initial distribution rate of 4.7 per cent per annum, amounting to $805 million.\n\nOn the seemingly moderate response, a DBS spokeswoman said that over 70 per cent of investors who submitted applications opted for a rate of 4.7 per cent, at the bottom end of the tender range.\n\n\"Unlike other issues that are open to all qualifying investors, our tender offer was made available only to a select group, namely holders of DBS's existing $1.7 billion preference shares. In addition, we are aware that the current mandates of some institutional investors might not have allowed them to buy Basel III instruments,\" she said.\n\nChng Sok Hui, DBS chief financial officer, said that the innovative transaction aimed to achieve several objectives simultaneously. \"We enhanced the regulatory capital base by replacing non-qualifying preference shares with Basel III-compliant capital securities at the same dividend/distribution rate.\n\n\"At the same time, we wanted to give investors in the existing preference shares an opportunity to reinvest in the new capital securities. We are pleased that so many of the investors in these existing preference shares took note of DBS Bank's continuing right to redeem the existing preference shares and chose to express an interest to remain investors in the DBS Group by responding positively to this innovative tender offer that marks our first Basel III issue.\"\n\nThe spokeswoman added that both securities were priced at 4.7 per cent yield to first call date. \"However, the new capital securities have only 5.5 years to the first call date, whereas the existing preference shares have almost seven years to the first call date. The shorter tenor to call is worth 42 basis points.\"\n\n\"On that basis, the new capital securities represent good value relative to the existing preference shares,\" she said.\n\nAs for whether there would be another exchange for the preference shares that were not tendered, she said that depending on market conditions, \"we will study all available options\".\n\nIn 2010, the bank also sold a retail tranche of $800 million 4.7 per cent preference shares. In all, DBS has about $4 billion of capital securities which are not Basel III-compliant. Under the transitional Basel III rules, 10 per cent would not qualify as Tier 1 capital each year starting from January this year.\n\nDBS said that the perpetuals are expected to be issued on Dec 3. Moody's Investors Services has rated them Baa1 (hybrid). Fitch Ratings has rated them BBB (expected) as it will confirm the ratings after the issue date.\n\nDBS will be sending confirmations to holders as to whether their existing preference shares have been accepted for exchange. Holders should also check their CDP statement. Others whose existing preference shares are held by a depository agent should contact the agent.\n\nEarlier this month, United Overseas Bank sold $500 million 4.75 per cent perpetual Basel III compliant bonds, its second tranche of such bonds under the stricter capital rules. The November issue was 3.7 times subscribed with orders hitting $1.85 billion, and because of the strong demand, UOB was able to price it lower than the $850 million 4.9 per cent tranche in July.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth/wealth-investing/banking-3-rights", "site_title": "Banking on the 3-Rights", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nBanking on the 3-Rights\n\nRight price, right business and right management are key, writes GENEVIEVE CUA\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Nov 26, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nFUNDS which profess to be absolutely return-oriented typically wield a number of tools to achieve this - cash, short sales of securities, market timing and derivatives, for instance. Not so for Yeoman Capital Management. The home-grown firm, whose flagship fund has an enviable 16-year track record, eschews cash and market timing in its quest for absolute returns. Instead, the Yeoman 3-Rights Value Asia Fund relies on old fashioned, long-only value stockpicking, and stays fully invested at any single point in time. So far, the results have been rewarding. In the current year to end-October, the fund has generated returns of 19.34 per cent, compared with the MSCI Far East ex Japan index return of 3.45 per cent.\n\nSince its inception in October 1997, the fund has achieved cumulative returns of more than 638 per cent, compared with the index return of 110 per cent. This translates to a compounded annual return of 13.3 per cent. An investor who put in $100,000 at inception would have seen his funds grow to more than $738,000 - a tidy nest egg.\n\nYeo Seng Chong, Yeoman's founder and chief executive, says undervaluation is the \"prime and only motivation for investing''. \"If we can't get undervaluation, we don't participate. The undervaluation is measured in terms of PE (price earnings multiple), dividend yield, free cash flow and discount to balance sheet book value. We also look at return on equity to make sure our stocks have capital efficiency.\n\n\"We have a track record and returns consistent with our methodology. Because we have not used cash as a buffer or timing tool, what you see today in performance is entirely due to security selection and portfolio construction.''\n\nThe basic premise is to view stocks as operating businesses. Risk is then defined not as price volatility but as the probability of a company going bust, and avoiding such instances that may result in \"total and permanent impairment'' of capital. The firm's discipline revolves around what Mr Yeo calls the three \"Rs''. These comprise the right price - that is, the share price should be below the assessed fair value. The second \"R'' is the right business, where companies should show a reasonably strong balance sheet, stable cash flows, a long operating and listing history and a track record of financial solvency. Businesses must be \"stable and staple''. \"Concepts work when there is a frenzy and investor hunger for them, but we're not sure it can be sustained, so we look for a business or product that is stable, that the real world might want.''\n\nThe third \"R'' is right management, with competent and honest people at board and management levels. Stocks are sold once valuations hit or exceed fair values. Industries the fund is currently exposed to include pharmaceuticals, textiles and apparel and electronic equipment.\n\nA commentary on Yeoman's website explains its approach: \"If we have the comfort of time on our side and the stocks that we own are backed by real businesses generating adequate earnings relative to our price at entry and the cost of the company's capital employed, then we are getting richer by the day, no matter where the market goes.\n\n\"If we get the '3-Rights' right, time is our friend. In the short term, price and value may not converge but over the longer term they surely must.''\n\nPoint of connection\n\nMr Yeo says that well before he founded Yeoman, he understood the connection between operating businesses and listed equities. He spent more than three decades in the public and private sectors before he started Yeoman, including stints in Centrepoint Properties, Metro Holdings and Singapore Technologies.\n\n\"I recognised that there is a certain logic that joins people who work in portfolio management dealing with listed equities, and people in the private arena. There is a point of connection that I saw ever so clearly - the economics of businesses, the profits generated and returns are important.\n\n\"Second, the price that you pay to acquire a business is important. And the management, whether you employ your own or take managers from a joint-venture partner. In the case of a private business, these factors are negotiated. In the public arena, the market gives you a traded price.\n\n\"We apply the private business approach and ported it to the public world. We look for businesses with the right economics, that are undervalued relative to the assessed merits of the business, and they must have management that are able to safeguard the interests of shareholders and ensure that the hoped-for benefits eventually accrue to us.''\n\nThe fund invests in around 70 stocks. Diversification is a key principle. On an equally weighted basis, the exposure to a single stock comes to about 1.4 per cent. \"If something doesn't work out in one stock and we suffer permanent and total impairment, we would have lost 1.4 per cent. But if the remaining stocks work out, and typically we pay 50 cents on the dollar - that is, we assess that the stock is worth $1 and we pay 50 cents - ... the loss would be more than covered.\n\n\"A lot of people spend time picking that one winner that makes a killing. We think that's best left to the person with a strong imagination. As stewards of other people's money, we can't take liberties. As we work on probabilities, this method of investing is very good. The reward is maximised through the '50 cents on the dollar' approach. Value will be realised at some point. Should something come up to hurt us, the loss is well contained.''\n\nWhile the strategy has generated consistent outperformance - the fund has outperformed the index in 13 out of 16 calendar years - it does not shield investors from short term losses. The worst year, for instance, was 2008 where the fund suffered a 47 per cent loss, compared to the index's loss of 48 per cent.\n\nStill, over its 16-year history, it has generated positive returns two-thirds of the time, compared with the index, which has chalked up positive returns 50 per cent of the time. Interestingly, the portfolio beta on a one-year basis is 0.55, which suggests it is less volatile than the market. Beta is a measure of risk or volatility relative to the market.\n\nInvestors therefore will have to be patient and take a longer horizon of at least three to five years. The fund, which has some $117 million in assets, has mostly individual investors. Institutions at the moment account for roughly 10 per cent. These include a family office and trusts. The fund is open only to accredited investors, and the minimum investment amount is $250,000.\n\nSays Mr Yeo: \"Not all investors will find us suitable. We tell people our methodology. We make no promises on short-term price movements; investors will have to be prepared to take short-term fluctuations.'' It would appear that Yeoman's clients understand this as there were no redemptions during the 2008 crisis. This helped the fund to avoid having to sell shares at low valuations to meet redemptions.\n\nHe adds: \"This is one benefit of a 16-year track record. We have every confidence in the way we've invested and what we've achieved. We look forward eagerly that clients will benefit, that over the future they'll be better off than today.'' An annual management fee of 1 per cent applies. There is also a performance fee of 15 per cent, subject to a high water mark. The latter means the fund has to exceed the previous high for the fee to be charged anew.\n\nThere are also early exit charges if investors hold for less than three years.

That would make it the world's second-largest gambling destination after Macau.\n\nSo far, the cities of Tokyo and Osaka have garnered much of the attention, but even towns like Sasebo, a once-proud shipbuilding centre in southern Japan, and the ageing port city of Otaru to the north, are hoping to set up casinos to draw tourists, generate tax revenues and reverse demographic decline.\n\n\"Hot springs, Japanese cuisine, Mt Fuji and geisha (female entertainers) - these traditional Japanese things alone are not enough,\" said Kanekiyo Morita, a hotel executive who has proposed a pyramid-shaped casino in Atami, a hot springs town in central Japan. \"Japan's population is rapidly declining and, for tourist towns, getting foreigners to visit is extremely important.\"\n\nLicensing matters\n\nLawmakers are planning to submit an initial bill aimed at legalising casinos by Dec 6 - when the current session of parliament ends - and enact concrete laws in 2015. The bill is thought to have a decent chance of passing with the business-friendly Liberal Democratic Party in power and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe backing the move.\n\nThe lawmakers have proposed two types of licences - one for large integrated resorts run by global operators featuring convention and entertainment facilities in addition to expansive gambling floors, and another for more compact gambling resorts in the countryside.\n\nBut they have also recommended that Japan limit the number of licences, prioritising locations promising the biggest economic impact and with the capacity to attract overseas tourists.\n\n\"I don't mean to negate Tokyo and Osaka,\" said Keiichi Kimura, who heads a consultancy and advises local governments and casino operators interested in Japan. \"But it's just not right to be focusing the debate on those two places only.\"\n\nLas Vegas Sands Corp and MGM Resorts International have made it clear that Osaka and the Tokyo region are their primary targets.\n\n\"These are the locations you can drive that kind of business tourism into and are known as commercial and financial hubs,\" George Tanasijevich, president of Las Vegas Sands unit Marina Bay Sands, told Reuters after a presentation in September in which he showed a mock-up for a casino resort on Tokyo Bay.\n\nWhile lawmakers have not indicated how many locations would be given the right to develop a casino, some politicians involved in the discussions have suggested that one or two licences might be allocated to big cities and one or two to regional economies.\n\nIn Sasebo in Nagasaki Prefecture, business and political leaders want to secure one of those spots for a proposed casino alongside the windmills and canals of Huis Ten Bosch, a theme park modelled on a 17th century Dutch town.\n\nThe complex, which would include a hotel and entertainment facilities in addition to gaming tables and slot machines, would generate nearly US$1 billion in annual revenues, the local group estimates, jolting new life into a region that once had a vibrant manufacturing sector but is increasingly reliant on tourism. The plan is to attract tourists from nearby South Korea, China and Taiwan in addition to locals.\n\n\"Tokyo shouldn't absorb everything,\" said Hideo Sawada, the chairman of travel agent H I S, which owns Huis Ten Bosch. \"We need balanced growth between Tokyo and the local cities.\"\n\nIn contrast to the massive resorts of Las Vegas and Singapore, aspiring hosts outside the big cities are looking to the more compact facilities of Europe as a guide.\n\nThe German spa town of Baden-Baden, which also has casinos, is serving as a model for casino proponents in two traditional hot springs towns - Atami, in Shizuoka Prefecture, and Naruto, in south-western Japan's Tokushima Prefecture.\n\nCasinos Austria AG and Switzerland's Grand Casino Luzern are both considering entering the Japanese market with a local partner but don't have billions of dollars to spend. To cut costs, they could use existing hotels and buildings.\n\n\"There are buildings that could be re-utilised and rejuvenated in Japan. That's a key feature of the European model,\" Grand Casino Luzern CEO Wolfgang Bliem, who recently spoke at casino conferences in Naruto and Tokyo, told Reuters. \"The casino operation should blend into the community.\"\n\nBig-ticket casinos set up in recent years have cost billions of dollars. The Marina Bay Sands, built on the mouth of the Singapore River, cost US$6 billion while the Sands Cotai Central that opened in Macau last year cost US$5 billion. Las Vegas magnate Steve Wynn has said his new Macau luxury resort, set to include a large lake with dancing water fountains and air-conditioned gondolas, will cost US$4 billion.\n\nThe northernmost island of Hokkaido is shaping up as one of the key casino battlegrounds with three locations - the port towns of Otaru and Tomakomai and Kushiro on the eastern coast - officially putting themselves forward as aspiring hosts.\n\nHokkaido, which draws tourists seeking a cooler location in the summer and skiers in the winter, has been cited by casino executives as one of the most attractive spots outside Tokyo and Osaka, along with the beaches of Okinawa in the south.\n\nCaesars Entertainment Corp said both Hokkaido and Okinawa were on its radar screen. It has visited officials in Kushiro, a Hokkaido city of 200,000 that is proposing a casino built around a hot springs resort that would also promote the culture of the indigenous Ainu people.\n\nCaesars is qualified to run a casino in Japan regardless of whether it is \"an urban resort in Tokyo or Osaka, a beach resort in Okinawa, or a mountain resort in Hokkaido\", said Steven Tight, head of the company's international development division.\n\nEconomic stimulation needed\n\nCasinos Austria is one of the global casino operators that has shown an interest in Otaru, a harbour town whose proximity to Sapporo, the biggest city on Hokkaido, is considered a key asset in the casino stakes.\n\nWhile Otaru attracts nearly seven million tourists a year, too many pass through, spending a fraction of what they would if they stayed overnight. Otaru mayor Yoshiharu Nakamatsu thinks a casino - perhaps one along the town's canal district or inside a retired cruise ship in the harbour - would change that.\n\nWithout a catalyst, he warns Otaru faces a bleak future. A third of its residents are above the age of 65, well above the national average and the highest among cities in Hokkaido. \"Our economy faces a negative spiral,\" he said in an interview last month. \"Otaru is not the only place with these problems.\" - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

It is no longer a forbidding bookend to the grand axis of Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Now it feels like an extension of the park itself. The nearby Unisphere seems to be on display inside, so clear is the view through the glass curtain wall of the museum's facade.\n\nDaylight fills the new atrium, a space made possible by the removal of the ice rink that once shared the building. The light is gentle, softened and diffused by a great rectangular lantern suspended from the ceiling. Composed of 12 rows of angled, translucent glass panels, the lantern is reminiscent of lamps designed by the sculptor Isamu Noguchi. Except that it is 30 feet high.\n\nAdmirers of the museum's revered and quirky centrepiece - the Panorama of the City of New York, a 1-to-1,200 scale model of all five boroughs, constructed for the 1964-65 World's Fair - will find another reason to celebrate.\n\nThe Panorama can now be entered directly from the main lobby through a glass doorway that offers an intriguing glimpse of Coney Island, Sea Gate and Gravesend Bay.\n\nThe lobby floor was reset at the equivalent of sea level on the model, meaning that this five-foot-nine-inch reporter looks down on Brooklyn from the scale-model altitude of about 7,000 feet.\n\nTom Finkelpearl, the executive director of the Queens Museum (it shed \"of Art\" in the renovation), said he was in love with a shallow cascade of four steps, in a broad U-shape, that divide the lobby and create an informal sunken amphitheater. Museumgoers have already gravitated to these impromptu benches without prompting, voting with their seats.\n\nThis is a long way from where matters stood in January 2005, after museum and city officials decided to part ways with the architect Eric Owen Moss, to his dismay and evident surprise. Mr Moss had won a competition in 2002 to reimagine the museum, which was squeezed awkwardly into the New York City pavilion from the World's Fair of 1939-40.\n\nThat threw the choice of a new architect to a pilot procedure called the Design and Construction Excellence Program. Under one part of this programme, the city enters into standing procurement contracts with a short list of architectural firms, chosen for the quality of their work.\n\nThen, for the next couple of years, the Department of Design and Construction, together with the city agencies that are its clients, can call on any of those firms, as needed, to work on municipal projects.\n\nDavid Burney, the commissioner of design and construction, said the programme typically saved up to nine months from the process of securing architectural services. What's more, it all but ensures that the work will be handled by well-regarded, innovative designers.\n\nGrimshaw Architects, an international practice based in London, was on this list in 2004, as a joint venture with Ammann & Whitney of New York.\n\nMark Husser, the managing partner of Grimshaw's New York office, had worked under the federal design excellence programme on a courthouse in Denver when he was with the firm of Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum. So he was already convinced of the value of such an approach.\n\n\"That programme transformed America's investment in federal buildings and obviously became a prototype for cities and municipalities,\" Mr Husser said. \"When it became public that this would be part of the Bloomberg administration's design initiative, we were very interested.\" But Grimshaw had not yet designed any museums in North America.\n\n\"I hadn't heard of them,\" Mr Finkelpearl allowed.\n\nGrimshaw won the museum over.\n\n\"Grimshaw produced a menu that enabled Tom and his people to think through what they wanted to do with their money,\" Mr Burney said. He distinguished this approach from architectural competitions that leave clients trying to figure out how to pay for a highly publicised design, whether it serves their needs or not.\n\nMr Burney said his agency did not necessarily look to a firm's experience with a given building type when making a choice. \"We try to avoid the siloing of architects,\" he said.\n\nThe city's design excellence programme, which was in its experimental phase when the Queens Museum job came along, is now standard operating procedure. Six firms are currently eligible for projects worth US$15 million or more: Allied Works Architecture, BIG-Bjarke Ingels Group, Ennead Architects, Steven Holl Architects, Studio Gang Architects and TEN Arquitectos. For smaller jobs, 20 firms are on call.\n\nGrimshaw has been in the cohort three times since 2004, but is not currently.\n\n\"We like to bring in some new blood, as well,\" Mr Burney explained.\n\n\"We're trying to match the right design team to the right project,\" he said. \"We're like a dating agency.\" \"And once that's done,\" he added, \"we're like the marriage counsellor.\" - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

The first of the three tank barges - the largest-ever built by VT Halter Marine - was delivered on Nov 8.\n\nEarlier this month, ST Engineering reported a 10.3 per cent fall in net profit to $131.4 million for the third quarter ended Sept 30, on the back of weaker profits in its aerospace and land systems businesses. Its shares closed five cents lower at $3.98 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But now, instead of a computer being unable to process \"00\" as the year \"2000\", the bogeyman of machinery is an actual man. Several men, in fact, wearing the same Guy Fawkes mask and threatening to wreak havoc on the digital economy that underpins the physical one.\n\nLike so many Agent Smiths in The Matrix, hackers have manifested themselves in a seemingly unending series of iterations all over the ether of the Internet. They are unrelenting and numerous, most of the time thought of as a collective and faceless menace.\n\nOne of them might have been unmasked earlier this month, and just yesterday, faced the court for the second time in connection with the hacking of the Ang Mo Kio town council website. As the police investigation runs its course, some imponderables might be answered.\n\nBut perhaps the larger point is that this is hardly a country-specific phenomenon.\n\nOne after another this year, key institutions of developed countries have fallen prey to hacking activities.\n\nThe websites of Australia's police force and the Reserve Bank of Australia were attacked just last week. Before that, more than 170 other Australian websites were defaced.\n\nIn March, hackers paralysed the computer networks of South Korea's banks and two of its broadcasters. This is the only Asian country in the OECD's top 10 most-wired countries apart from Japan - a fact of little consolation to anyone in South Korea or to anyone else aspiring towards its level of development.\n\nGallingly enough, just this month, a report prepared for US President Barack Obama by his Council of Advisors on Science and Technology found that: \"The federal government rarely follows accepted best practices.\"\n\n\"It needs to lead by example and accelerate its efforts to make routine cyber attacks more difficult by implementing best practices for its own systems,\" it added.\n\nIn the wake of the cyber attacks, the common reasoning among bureaucrats and executives globally has run along the lines of resource allocation. Of course, there will be a worse outcome, they will say. The question is, can we afford it?\n\nIt is worth considering if the risk - a function of expected loss and the probability of the loss happening - is being mispriced. The motives of hackers are no longer solely financial. Now they are opaque, ideological, constantly in flux and sometimes even non-existent.\n\nIt is perfectly legitimate to weigh the cost of a bad outcome against the cost of defending against that outcome. But the formula must be re-examined. If a cyber defence budget does not allow for irrationality or randomness in its calculation, it will be of little use. In order to play a game, both sides must understand the rules. And the rules have changed. Or maybe there aren't any rules.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Only the owners of F&N's $108.25 million of 5.5 per cent notes due 2016 and $200 million of 6 per cent notes due 2019 had rejected the deal two weeks ago; holders of the $150 million of 3.62 per cent notes due 2015, $50 million of 2.54 per cent notes due 2015 and $220 million of 2.48 per cent notes due 2016 approved it.\n\nF&N will now have to decide how to deal with the bondholders who, by rejecting the deal, appeared to be calling F&N's bluff of a possible strategic default. If it chose to default, F&N could suffer consequences elsewhere, but would not have to pay bondholders as much.\n\n\"Now that the approval of this series of bondholders has been obtained, the F&N board should try its level best to work out an amicable solution as soon as possible to resolve the deadlock involving the two other series of bondholders who had earlier rejected the offer,\" corporate lawyer Robson Lee said. \"Certainty on the proposed divestment of F&N's property business is important for investors who intend to trade on F&N's shares.\"\n\nF&N shares closed unchanged at $5.72 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

OrangeTee estimates that one in five flats in Singapore are now sold at zero COV or even negative COV.\n\nOng Kah Seng, the director at R'ST Research, noting the moderation in resale prices, said: \"But that said, I think the BTO flats will cater to those who really want to have a more affordable option.\"\n\nEugene Lim, a key executive officer at ERA Realty, said, however, that demand from singles has not been met, so there will be continued oversubscription for two-room flats in this BTO exercise.\n\nIn Woodlands, HDB is offering 993 units of two- to five-room flats for the Admiralty Grove project between Woodlands Avenue 6 and Woodlands Drive 62. (See map for the prices at each project.)\n\nHougang Meadow along Upper Serangoon Road will have 732 flats, comprising studio apartments, three-room and four-room flats.\n\nThese two projects are expected to be popular, primarily because they are near MRT stations.\n\nHDB is also launching two projects in Jurong West: Boon Lay View and Yung Kuang Court.\n\nBoon Lay View, bounded by Jurong West Avenue 2, Corporation Road and Boon Lay Avenue, will have 810 homes. These will range from three-room to 3-Gen units.\n\nMs Li said the 3-Gen flats in Boon Lay could attract a fair bit of interest; it is only the second time the government has put such units on the market.\n\n3-Gen flats were launched alongside five-room flats in Yishun at the last BTO exercise to keen interest.\n\nAt Yung Kuang Court between Corporation Road and Yung Kuang Road, there will be 528 four- and five-room flats.\n\nThe biggest project by number of units offered yesterday was West Ridges @ Bukit Batok along Bukit Batok Road, with 1,578 two- to five-room flats.\n\nThe sixth and final BTO launch yesterday was EastLawn @ Canberra, located near Sungei Simpang Kiri and Sembawang Road, with 337 four and five-room flats.\n\nThe 3,974 SBF units are spread across 24 towns or estates, including Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Merah, Central and Queenstown. Prices start at $73,000 for a studio apartment and go up to $485,000 for an executive flat. Among them are two units at The Pinnacle @ Duxton, which Mr Lim thinks will be hotly contested because of their potential for capital appreciation in the resale market.\n\nThe launches yesterday brought total BTO supply this year to 25,139 flats. Together with balance and additional two-room flats from previous exercises, HDB has released 33,568 flats for sale this year.\n\nIn January, another 3,150 BTO flats in Bukit Batok, Jurong West, Punggol, Serangoon and Woodlands will be made available.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In July, Oxley unveiled separate acquisitions of three plots of land in Cambodia. Adding a joint venture to develop another plot, this brings the total number of pipeline projects in Cambodia to four.\n\nIn China, Oxley entered into an agreement to acquire a 10 per cent stake in GD Capital, which will ultimately hold the land use rights for two plots of land of 102,506 sq m and 80,599 sq m, respectively, in Xuancheng Economic and Technical Development Zone, Anhui province.\n\nUnder the deal, Oxley will also be able to participate, with up to 30 per cent interest, in the development of five other land parcels in the same economic zone.\n\nThe company has a further five projects in Malaysia spread across Selangor, Johor Bahru, Kuala Lumpur and Penang. It marked its first overseas acquisition on May 29, when it bought a Malaysia-incorporated company that clinched the rights for a mixed development site in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nOxley this month posted record-high quarterly earnings, with net profit for the first quarter ended September surging to a record $250.8 million, from just $6.6 million a year ago.\n\nFor the quarter under review, revenue soared to $686 million, compared with $50 million a year ago.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The president of one of the companies, Hua Yuan Property Company Ltd's Ren Zhiqiang, said in a posting on an Internet microblogging site that he's considering whether to pursue legal action against the broadcaster.\n\nCCTV has attracted attention internationally this year, with reports that previously targeted global companies operating in China, including Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd over quality and service issues, and Starbucks Corp over pricing.\n\nThe row over the broadcast comes as home prices in large Chinese cities have set records, despite a four- year-long government campaign to cool the property market, raising concerns over a potential price bubble. Officials at CCTV weren't immediately available for comment early on Tuesday.\n\nIn the broadcast that aired on Sunday, CCTV cited calculations by a Beijing-based lawyer, Li Jinsong, as showing 45 listed property firms were among developers that should have paid more than 4.6 trillion yuan in land taxes from 2005 to 2012. According to the calculations, the authorities collected only 800 billion yuan for the period.\n\nOther companies named in the report include China Vanke Co Ltd, the country's largest property developer by sales, and Agile Property Holdings.\n\nFitch Ratings said in a report on Monday that land taxes payable in future aren't a major concern for the Chinese property developers on which it issues ratings. \"The payables arise from the timing gap between when property is delivered and taxes are paid, and the practices of developers in this regard are normal and consistent in China,\" the ratings agency said. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

This was largely a result of most segments expanding amid improved demand.\n\nSaid Credit Suisse economist Robert Prior-Wandesforde: \"This is the strongest increase since November 2010, suggesting the sector is enjoying something of a renaissance after a couple of years that can only be described as utterly miserable.\"\n\nCiti economist Kit Wei Zheng noted that the pick-up in electronics industrial production was in line with more upbeat global leading indicators of electronics demand.\n\nIn particular, the semiconductor segment - which accounts for one-fifth of all manufacturing output - expanded 20.3 per cent in October.\n\nBut economists from UOB and CIMB told BT that the climb in electronics output stemmed largely from base effects.\n\nSaid UOB's Francis Tan: \"I think we more or less expected this (year-on-year surge in electronics output), because it's due to the low base seen this time last year, so it's not a stellar result actually. (But) electronics is certainly ticking upwards and on a recovery trend - it's just that the trajectory is slower with a gently rising slope.\"\n\nAdded CIMB's Song Seng Wun: \"The base effect inevitably exaggerates the extent of the recovery, but I think the data still points to clear signs of improvement (in electronics). We can quibble about the magnitude (of such a recovery), but the direction is there, and that's important.\"\n\nBoth economists expect the electronics sector to continue to post double-digit increases in output in the coming months - lifting overall industrial production growth as a result - mainly because of a low base recorded in the latter part of 2012 and the beginning of this year.\n\nThe transport and engineering sector also gave a leg-up to October's numbers, expanding 8.9 per cent from a year ago. Supported by higher contributions from rig building projects, the marine & offshore engineering segment expanded 17.8 per cent. In contrast, the land and aerospace segments declined 3.5 per cent and 4.1 per cent, respectively.\n\nOutput of the precision engineering cluster grew 5 per cent from a year ago, buoyed by higher output in the machinery & systems segment. Output of the remaining clusters - chemicals, general manufacturing and biomedical manufacturing - fell a respective 0.9 per cent, 1.6 per cent, and 2.3 per cent in October compared to a year ago.\n\nSaid OCBC economist Selena Ling: \"This data set confirmed that the biomedical cluster is currently undergoing a soft patch, but the electronics recovery theme is intact. (The growth in manufacturing output) should continue to pick up momentum in 2014 as the global economy, particularly the G3, stages a stronger recovery.\n\n\"We are looking for Singapore's manufacturing growth to more than double from our forecast of 1.4 per cent year-on-year in 2013 to 3.7 per cent year-on-year in 2014,\" said Ms Ling.\n\nEDB said that after adjusting for seasonal factors, industrial production was unchanged month-on-month in October. Excluding biomedical manufacturing, output would have grown 0.2 per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Typically, Wild Rice takes a well-loved fairy tale and rewrites it with a local setting, politically incorrect jokes and gender-bending characters.\n\nUnfortunately, not all pantomimes are created equal. And this year's Jack & the Bean-Sprout suffers from a somewhat draggy script and some half-baked jokes.\n\nIf not for the presence of a few strong comic actors, who miraculously turn passable jokes into good ones, the eye-popping production design and Ivan Heng's directorial embellishments, this Jack could have been a humdrum affair.\n\nTroubles begin early when kopitiam assistants Siew Dai (Jo Tan) and Kopi Gao (Candice De Rozario) attempt to warm up the audience with jokes that fail to take off. Trying to milk humour from mispronouncing \"trial\" as \"tra-yel\" can only go so far; mixing up \"huat\" with \"what\" and \"Ah Kow\" with \"a cow\" is a bad idea.\n\nFortunately, Caleb Goh as the lead Jack holds the stage well, as does Darius Tan as Jack's diva-esque mother. It's perhaps apt that Siti Khalijah plays the goose that lays the golden eggs, while Karen Tan plays the Golden Hits Harp - these comedians are worth their weight in gold. The script is credited to Joel Tan, but it's not uncommon for the cast and director to generate some of their own jokes during rehearsals.\n\nProduction design is uniformly strong, though this reviewer particularly loves Ian Bailie's Pop Art set design that turns Jack's Hougang estate into a candy-coloured wonderland.\n\nIf you're not too critical about your entertainment, you'll certainly have a jolly good time. But Jack & the Bean-Sprout is far from being Wild Rice's best pantomime.\n\nJack & the Bean-Sprout! plays at the Drama Centre from now till Dec 14 at 7.30pm and weekend matinees.

And payments will rise further when the Federal Reserve starts to hike rates, because the loans usually carry floating interest rates.\n\nThe number of borrowers missing payments around the 10-year point can double in their eleventh year, data from consumer credit agency Equifax shows. When the loans go bad, banks can lose an eye-popping 90 cents on the US dollar, because a home equity line of credit is usually the second mortgage a borrower has.\n\nIf the bank forecloses, most of the proceeds of the sale pay off the main mortgage, leaving little for the home equity lender.\n\nThere are scenarios where everything works out fine. For example, if economic growth picks up, and home prices rise, borrowers may be able to refinance their main mortgage and their home equity lines of credit into a single new fixed-rate loan. Some borrowers would also be able to repay their loans by selling their homes into a strengthening market.\n\nBut some regulators, rating agencies, and analysts are alarmed. The US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a regulator overseeing national banks, has been warning banks about the risk of home equity lines since the spring of 2012. It is pressing banks to quantify their risks and minimise them where possible.\n\nAt a conference last month in Washington, DC, Amy Crews Cutts, the chief economist at consumer credit agency Equifax, told mortgage bankers that an increase in tens of thousands of homeowners' monthly payments on these home equity lines is a pending \"wave of disaster\".\n\nBanks marketed home equity lines of credit aggressively before the housing bubble burst, and consumers were all too happy to use these loans like a cheaper version of credit card debt, paying for vacations and cars.\n\nThe big banks, including Bank of America Corp (BOA), Wells Fargo & Co, Citigroup Inc, and JPMorgan Chase & Co have more than US$10 billion of these home equity lines of credit on their books each, and in some cases much more than that.\n\nHow bad home equity lines of credit end up being for banks will hinge on the percentage of loans that default. Analysts struggle to forecast that number.\n\nIn the best-case scenario, losses will edge higher from current levels, and will be entirely manageable. But the worst-case scenario for some banks could be bad, eating deeply into their earnings and potentially cutting into their equity levels at a time when banks are under pressure to boost capital levels.\n\n\"We just don't know how close people are until they ultimately do hit delinquencies,\" said Darrin Benhart, the deputy comptroller for credit and market risk at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Banks can get some idea from updated credit scores, but \"it's difficult to ferret that risk out,\" he noted.\n\nWhat is happening with home equity lines of credit illustrates how the mortgage bubble that formed in the years before the financial crisis is still hurting banks, even seven years after it burst. By many measures the mortgage market has yet to recover: The federal government still backs nine out of every 10 home loans, 4.6 million foreclosures have been completed, and borrowers with excellent credit scores are still being denied loans.\n\nBanks have some options for reducing their losses. They can encourage borrowers to sign up for a workout programme if they will not be able to make their payments.\n\nIn some cases, they can change the terms of the lines of credit to allow borrowers to pay only interest on their loans for a longer period, or to take longer to repay principal.\n\nA BOA spokesman said in a statement that the bank is reaching out to customers more than a year before they have to start repaying principal on their loans, to explain options for refinancing or modifying their loans.\n\nBut these measures will only help so much, said Ms Crews Cutts. \"There's no easy out on this.\"\n\nBetween the end of 2003 and the end of 2007, outstanding debt on banks' home equity lines of credit jumped by 77 per cent, to US$611.4 billion from US$346.1 billion, according to FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) data, and while not every loan requires borrowers to start repaying principal after 10 years, most do.\n\nThese loans were attractive to banks during the housing boom, in part because lenders thought they could rely on the collateral value of the home to keep rising.\n\n\"These are very profitable at the beginning. People will take out these lines and make the early payments that are due,\" said Anthony Sanders, a professor of real estate finance at George Mason University who used to be a mortgage bond analyst at Deutsche Bank.\n\nBut after 10 years, a consumer with a US$30,000 home equity line of credit and an initial interest rate of 3.25 per cent would see their required payment jumping to US$293.16 from US$81.25, analysts from Fitch Ratings calculate. That's why the loans are starting to look problematic: For home equity lines of credit made in 2003, missed payments have already started jumping.\n\nBorrowers are delinquent on about 5.6 per cent of loans made in 2003 that have hit their 10-year mark, Equifax data show, a figure that the agency estimates could rise to around 6 per cent this year. That's a big jump from 2012, when delinquencies for loans from 2003 were closer to 3 per cent.\n\nThis scenario will be increasingly common in the coming years: in 2014, borrowers on US$29 billion of these loans at the biggest banks will see their monthly payment jump, followed by US$53 billion in 2015, US$66 billion in 2016, and US$73 billion in 2017.\n\nThe Federal Reserve could start raising rates as soon as July 2015, interest-rate futures markets show, which would also lift borrowers' monthly payments. The rising payments that consumers face \"is the single largest risk that impacts the home equity book in Citi Holdings\", Citigroup finance chief John Gerspach said on an Oct 16 conference call with analysts.\n\nA high percentage of home equity lines of credit went to people with bad credit to begin with - over 16 per cent of the home equity loans made in 2006, for example, went to people with credit scores below 659, seen by many banks as the dividing line between prime and sub-prime. In 2001, about 12 per cent of home equity borrowers were sub-prime. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

But the pace of growth slowed in many places. Those gains are also a double-edged sword. Rising values are essential for the approximately seven million Americans whose mortgages are larger than their homes are worth. But housing affordability has suffered as a result, just as interest rates have moved significantly higher.\n\nNew regulations slated to take effect in January could also make it more difficult for many potential home buyers to qualify for a loan.\n\n\"It's pretty clear that the recovery in home sales has at least stalled,\" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.\n\nReal estate had been a source of strength for the nation's economy after spending years in the rubble of the financial crisis.\n\nThe housing market was ground zero for the dangerous combination of insatiable demand and shady lending that triggered the country's financial crash. Many economists believe the recovery will not be sustainable until the sector is fully healed. Analysts had predicted that rising home prices, record-low mortgage rates and growing consumer demand would galvanise the industry, rebuilding household wealth and creating new jobs.\n\nThe housing market has made significant progress since bottoming out in 2009. The S&P/Case-Shiller index showed that home values are now on par with prices in 2004. The number of homes lost to foreclosure dropped 39 per cent in September compared with a year ago, according to CoreLogic. Owners are increasingly paying their mortgages on time. In the Washington region, prices gained 7 per cent in September from a year ago.\n\nBut other data released this week showed the sector is losing some of its lustre. Contracts to buy existing homes fell for the fifth straight month in October.\n\nMany analysts blame this on the rise in mortgage rates. Their unexpected climb began in late spring and undermined the real estate market's strength. From March to September, the average rate on a 30-year fixed loan shot up a percentage point, to nearly 4.5 per cent. Rates have since eased back down to 4.2 per cent, but analysts say it is unlikely they will return to last year's rock-bottom levels.\n\n\"Home buyers are trying to digest that,\" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. \"That has sucked some of the momentum out of the housing recovery, no doubt about it.\"\n\nThe run-up in rates was due in large part to Federal Reserve policies. The central bank helped push down long-term interest rates by buying US$85 billion a month in government bonds and mortgage-backed securities. But officials began suggesting in the spring that the economy could soon be strong enough for them to begin winding down that program. The prospect spooked investors, sending stock markets plunging and bond yields soaring - pushing up interest rates in the process.\n\n\"Everything hinges on the ability of the Fed to manage long-term rates higher,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"If they're not able to manage that, then the recovery is going to be disappointing.\"\n\nThe rapid increase in mortgage rates not only dampened enthusiasm among traditional home buyers, but it also turned away real estate investors who are often the primary bidders in hard-hit neighbourhoods. The declining stock of distressed properties combined with higher rates has made real estate a less attractive proposition for both institutional and mom-and-pop investors. In addition, the increase in rates choked off the refinancing business.\n\nThe Fed has since attempted to walk back some of its statements. Chairman Ben Bernanke and his nominated successor, Janet Yellen, have emphasised that the central bank is committed to supporting the recovery. And even after the Fed ends its bond-buying programme, short-term interest rates will likely remain near zero throughout next year.\n\nBut the housing market is poised to face a new headwind: New rules slated to take effect in January could make it more difficult for potential home buyers to qualify for a loan. The regulations require lenders to ensure that no more than 43 per cent of borrowers' income is being used to pay down debt, among other things.\n\nSome economists say the housing recovery won't be derailed by these speed bumps. A pickup in hiring, resilient consumer spending and a moderation in interest rates should keep the sector humming at least through the end of the year.\n\nBut it is no longer expected to be the driver of growth that many had predicted. Some analysts doubt those strong gains will ever materialise. Others have merely pushed their forecasts out another year.\n\n\"I still think housing is going to be a big plus for the economy,\" Mr Zandi said. \"But the timing is more questionable.\" - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

Its success in attracting retail customers is quite a feat, given that the number of traders continues to fall.\n\nAccording to the Investment Trends 2013 report, Singapore has about 15,000 retail forex traders, 25 per cent fewer than the 20,000 in 2012. This year's 15,000 traders consist of 3,500 new traders, 3,000 dormant traders who resumed trading and 8,500 traders who trade continuously.\n\nThe absolute number of forex traders, both retail and professionals, may have shrunk but volumes have exploded, driven by technology and the Internet, said Mr Yohannan.\n\nSingapore this year leapfrogged Japan to become the third-largest FX centre in the world - after London and New York - and the largest in Asia. Global banks, sovereign wealth funds and multinationals are increasingly basing their regional or treasury headquarters here.\n\nThe latest survey by the Bank for International Settlements noted that the average daily FX turnover volume here grew 44 per cent to US$383 billion in April this year, from US$266 billion in April 2010. Global turnover growth was 35 per cent during that period.\n\nGlobally, forex trading averaged US$5.3 trillion per day in April, up from US$4 trillion in 2010 and US$3.3 trillion in 2007.\n\n\"We're seeing a very healthy increase in the number of traders,\" said Mr Yohannan. \"OANDA is seeing double-digit growth in clients and volume.\"\n\nThe global financial crisis and the eurozone's troubles and then this year's turmoil in the currencies of several emerging markets, such as the Indonesian rupiah and India's rupee, as well as \"Abenomics\" attracts traders as volatility offers profit opportunities.\n\n\"Volatility is what retail FX traders look forward to as does the industry,\" he said.\n\nOANDA's success in attracting retail customers is a result of its transparent business model, he said.\n\nThe firm does not charge any commission; it makes money from quoting a spread to customers. Put simply, it means OANDA enjoys wholesale prices like banks while charging clients retail rates.\n\nClients fall into three categories - full-time traders, professionals such as doctors who trade as a sideline and newbies such as housewives, he said.\n\nIn fact, the fabled Japanese housewife Mrs Watanabe has long been a fixture of the industry. Japan has the largest retail forex market in the world, though trading volumes fell in the second half of this year as the yen stabilised.\n\nForex trading is not for the faint-hearted, though. In the second quarter of 2013, US forex brokers reported that 35 per cent of retail forex traders made money, with 65 per cent experiencing losses.\n\nMr Yohannan said there is no public data for Singapore, but added that the number of OANDA's traders who are profitable is very high relative to the industry. Clients are encouraged to start with small trades, and can practise on OANDA's demo platform free for life, he said.\n\nThe firm has a host of risk controls, he said. Leverage is 50 to one, which means the trader can bet up to $50 for every $1 he puts in. This compares with 25 to one for Japan and 400 to one in Australia.\n\nMr Yohannan said some 70-80 per cent of OANDA's customers' trades are in euro/dollar, followed by the aussie and yen. Customers from Hong Kong, China and India sometimes trade gold, too.\n\nSingapore residents make up about 60 per cent of its clients, with the rest from all over Asia, he said. The Asian business makes up 40 per cent of the group total. Incorporated in 1995, the group has offices in Chicago, London, Singapore, Tokyo, Toronto and Zurich.\n\nExpansion in Asia and partnerships with banks and brokers are next year's priority, he said.\n\n\"We already have Japan, we want to seriously make a foray into a few other markets; geographic expansion is one significant strategy for 2014, we do think we're something of a well-kept secret,\" he said.\n\nIn particular, he is looking to expand to other South-east Asian markets, Australia and New Zealand. OANDA will also do more in Japan, he said.\n\nThe firm wants to expand some of the channels that it has to reach out to more customers and is looking at partnership opportunities with banks, brokers and other financial institutions, he said.\n\nNegotiations with potential partners, including Singapore banks, are at a \"very high level\", he said.\n\nAs the Internet became widespread in 1995, OANDA was the first to make comprehensive currency exchange information available over the Internet. According to the group website, \"OANDA Rate\u00ae\" data has become the touchstone for corporations, tax authorities, auditing firms and even central banks.\n\nOANDA was co-founded by Michael Stumm, a professor of computer engineering at the University of Toronto, and Richard Olsen of The Olsen Ltd, an econometric research and development firm.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In light of this, PwC called for it to be extended, given that many companies are still in transition and need the support that PIC offers.\n\nBesides recommending these tune-ups for PIC, PwC also suggested that the government liberalise the restrictions on the enhanced tax deductions to include research and development (R&D) undertaken overseas.\n\nUnder the PIC scheme, companies which undertake R&D are eligible for an enhanced tax deduction of 400 per cent for up to $400,000 of eligible R&D expenditure. Beyond that limit, an enhanced deduction of 150 per cent of the balance of the qualifying R&D expenditure is available - but only if the R&D is done in Singapore.\n\nPwC said that some R&D, by their very nature, must be carried out at least partly overseas. \"An example of this would be in the pharmaceutical industry, where R&D conducted in connection with clinical testing of a new drug often needs to be conducted outside Singapore, simply because of the required population size for conducting a statistically significant clinical trial.\"\n\nFor R&D costs incurred overseas, a company would be able to claim that enhanced tax deduction of 400 per cent for the first $400,000 in expenditure; for R&D expenditures incurred overseas beyond that sum, the deduction is only 100 per cent, not 150 per cent.\n\nIn contrast, a company in another industry in which it is possible to do all R&D within Singapore shores would not be bound by such a restriction in terms of tax deductions. \"Such (an) anomaly should be properly addressed,\" said PwC.\n\nThe firm has also proposed new ways to manage costs for individuals, going beyond its usual exhortation to the government to \"stop allowing individuals to use CPF savings to finance property and investments (since this) results in an asset-rich, cash-poor retirement and contributes to an artificially inflated market for property\".\n\nAs telecommuting and home offices become more widespread, PwC suggested that those who work from home be given personal tax relief, as their home and resources are partially used for employment purposes. Britain and the US have such reliefs in place to allow for deductions for work-related expenses, such as business telephone calls and additional utilities.\n\nPwC has also called for progressive, structural tax changes to be considered over giving out of one-time rebates, \"(which have) now happened so regularly in recent years that (they are) becoming something of an expectation\".\n\n\"Rather than giving another one-time rebate . . . those revenues could be used to help the lower-income group through a more structural change in the tax rates,\" said PwC.\n\nIt proposes that the lowest two tax bands be abolished. This will do away with the 2 per cent on income from $20,000 to $30,000 and the 3.5 per cent on income from the $30,000 to $40,000 bands. \"Alternatively, channelling the surplus into more GST rebates and offsets for lower earners would make the tax structure more progressive.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But that conservative stance has nevertheless allowed SPH to maintain annual returns of about 4 per cent from the funds, he said.\n\nMr Lee addressed concerns that the company's cash is yielding slow returns by noting that despite some short-term pains, SPH is focused on the long term.\n\n\"Some of these investments that we make have a fairly long gestation period,\" he said, adding that \"when we invest in technology platforms . . . it takes many years for them to return a profit\".\n\nMr Lee also acknowledged that the past year has been challenging for the company as net profit declined. He noted that the yield from digital products is significantly lower than for print products, but he sees that as a necessary investment in the future as print circulation continues to come under pressure.\n\nPrint circulation for SPH's newspapers fell over the past year, but digital circulation grew for most products to increase overall subscriptions.\n\nThe Straits Times, SPH's flagship product, had 449,200 total subscriptions as at August 2013, of which 116,900 were digital.\n\nAll of these are \"part of the changes we are facing\", Mr Lee said.\n\nShareholder Vincent Tan asked if the company has to put more effort into making its core newspapers more relevant to its readers, and whether some of its costs, such as overseas correspondents, still make sense.\n\nMr Lee assured him that addressing relevance is a top priority for management.\n\nBut he also stressed that the company, which is actively trying to contain costs, does not want to sacrifice quality simply to cut expenses.\n\n\"We are a newspaper for the whole of Singapore and Singapore is closely engaged with the rest of the world,\" he said.\n\nHe also rejected a suggestion to pursue a more aggressive share-buyback programme, saying that core business growth should be the focus of the company rather than more immediate returns.\n\n\"This is positioning SPH for the future,\" Mr Lee said.\n\nShares in SPH closed at $4.26 yesterday, up 0.2 per cent or one cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The FIPB had initially given its verbal approval in October. SIA will now need to seek further approvals, such as a no-objection certificate from India's Ministry of Civil Aviation and a scheduled air operator's permit from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation.\n\nTata will have a 51 per cent stake in the New Delhi-based airline, while SIA will hold 49 per cent. Both SIA and Tata will invest a total of US$100 million in the full-service carrier, with SIA putting in US$49 million.\n\nThe new airline is expected to take to the skies by the middle of next year.\n\nSIA isn't the only carrier trying to gain a foothold in the populous country, where an emerging middle class is among factors proving to be a lure for airlines. AirAsia is working on setting up a budget carrier - also with Tata - while Etihad has scooped up a 24 per cent stake in Jet Airways.\n\nBut the operating environment in India doesn't come without challenges either, as existing carriers grapple with issues such as high taxes and poor infrastructure.\n\nLast year, only one Indian carrier, IndiGo, turned a profit.\n\nAt a results briefing earlier this month, SIA chief executive Goh Choon Phong said that while it recognised the venture wasn't going to be a walk in the park, SIA was confident it could make it work.\n\nShares in SIA closed at $10.53 yesterday, up 30 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

At the same time, nine out of 11 sectors have scaled down on expansion plans.\n\nThe dip in capacity utilisation might have prompted the move as companies producing at close to full capacity slipped to 24 per cent from 28 per cent in the previous quarter. Almost half of the manufacturers are operating within 61-80 per cent capacity.\n\nConsumers were likewise less confident about the coming months, their concerns centred mainly on expectations of higher prices. Some 88 per cent of respondents - the most since Q2 2011 - expect this will happen soon. Low-income, urban and eastern (states') consumers were the most apprehensive.\n\nThe Consumer Sentiments Index (CSI) dipped for the second consecutive quarter to 102 points from about 110 points. Mier said confidence remains, given the CSI registered above the 100-points threshold.\n\nEven so, the survey indicates consumers plan to ease up on spending because of job and income concerns. Respondents revealed less ambitious shopping plans and a lower appetite for houses, cars, furniture, washing machines, televisions and personal computers.\n\nThat said, automotive sales for the year to end-September were 6 per cent higher, and industry players remain confident of achieving record sales this year.\n\nThe central bank has projected economic growth next year will remain robust at 5-5.5 per cent.\n\nBut in the remaining months of 2013, there are signs aplenty of higher prices.\n\nIn an effort to curb the budget deficit and public debt, Putrajaya has said it will further reduce fuel subsidies next year. Electricity rates are also scheduled to rise by as much as a fifth according to the energy minister, while assessment charges for Kuala Lumpur property owners are being revised upwards.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Dr Balakrishnan pointed to a decision at the Warsaw climate conference that paves the way for international coordination of efforts to help vulnerable countries deal with future climate-related harm they say is inevitable. This new mechanism, to be set up by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, aims to deal with \"loss and damage\" from climate change.\n\nHe also referred to existing agreements to curb emissions to keep global temperature rise to within 2 degrees Celsius by 2100; and the establishment of institutions such as the Green Climate fund, to disburse public finance for climate aid to poor and vulnerable countries up to 2020.\n\nNonetheless, he cautioned: \"We've set up deadlines, institutions, mechanisms. But guess what? All of these are empty shells - meaning unless in the next two years we can make tough, hard decisions, the deadlines, funds, mechanisms will just remain negotiating (tools). The political capital, the real money, isn't there yet.\n\n\"That's why I'm pessimistic. But my own sense is at some point the world will face enough disasters, and people will come to their senses, and they will put political pressure on politicians to do the right thing. But it may not happen quickly enough.\"\n\nSingapore, however, is unique in that its very vulnerability has made it acutely conscious of environmental impacts since its conception as a sovereign state almost 50 years ago, Dr Balakrishnan noted.\n\n\"In the case of water, we've taken a strategic vulnerability and converted it to a strategic opportunity. Because we are painfully aware of our vulnerability in water, we've committed to achieving self-sufficiency well before 2061 (which is when Singapore's water agreement with Malaysia runs out.) Ten years ago, the application of reverse osmosis allowed us to recycle and desalinate water at a viable price, and that has given us great confidence that we can achieve self-sufficiency in water,\" he said. \"That's how we need to approach environment challenges: converting them to business opportunities.\"\n\nDr Balakrishnan also noted that governments have to create a sense of long-term stability and regulatory certainty, without which problems relating to climate change at a global level, or transboundary haze at a regional level, will not be resolved.\n\n\"Today, most of us are not aware of the sources or origins of products we use, or the impact of their production processes on our children's future. But increasingly, I believe people are going to demand answers and that will put political pressure on politicians to make the right decisions, and on businesses to do the right thing in the long term.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They only declined in Wenzhou.\n\nFormer Premier Wen Jiabao in March stepped up a three-year campaign to contain price gains, ordering cities with excessive increases to raise downpayments. China's 35 provincial-level cities have set annual home-price targets this year by mostly capping local income growth.\n\nThe new round of local government measures are more \"symbolic\" rather than having a real impact on the market because second-home buyers only account for about 10 per cent of home sales, the Centaline researcher said.\n\nThe northern city of Shenyang and the eastern cities of Nanchang and Xiamen also said on Tuesday they will raise second-home downpayments.\n\nHome prices in Nanjing jumped 13 per cent last month from a year earlier, while Hangzhou rose 6.7 per cent, according to SouFun Holdings Ltd, China's biggest real estate website owner. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

The mainboard-listed company's two 60-metre anchor handling tug-and-supply vessels will be deployed immediately after the group takes their delivery next month and in January. The first vessel will be deployed for at least a year in the Middle East, with a sale-and-purchase option exercisable after the charter period. The second vessel will be deployed for 21/2 years in north-east Australia. Swissco's chief executive officer Alex Yeo believes that demand for vessel-chartering services will continue to be robust.\n\nBoustead reaches out to retail investors\n\nBOUSTEAD Singapore will host its Retail Investor Days next month - on Dec 12 at 2pm and on Dec 13 at 9.30am. Both the sessions will include a presentation of the company's business updates and a financial review. The first session is for new retail investors; it will outline the products and services undertaken by the company's four business divisions.\n\nTechnics posts $8.6m Q4 loss; revenue plunges 69%\n\nTECHNICS Oil & Gas has sunk to a net loss of $8.6 million for the fourth quarter ended Sept 30, down from a net profit of $2.4 million previously. Revenue for the quarter fell 69 per cent year on year to $7.7 million as a result of the spin-off of Norr Offshore Group and a significant drop in contributions from subsidiaries. Loss per share for the quarter was 3.83 cents, down from an earnings per share of 1.18 cents the year before. The counter ended half a cent higher at 66.5 cents yesterday.\n\nKeong Hong net profit up 8.1% at $21.6m\n\nLOCAL construction group Keong Hong Holdings posted an 8.1 per cent rise in net profit to $21.6 million for the financial year ended Sept 30. This was despite registering a 12.4 per cent drop in revenue to $146.6 million, due mainly to lower revenue recognition for ongoing projects than in FY 2012. Earnings per share for the Catalist-listed group fell to 13.7 cents from 14.9 cents the year before.\n\nGoodland earnings slumps to $17m on lower revenue\n\nLISTED developer Goodland Group reported lower full-year earnings of $17.02 million, from $24.65 million a year earlier. It cited lower income recognised from projects of lower development value and overall lower share of profits from associated companies. Revenue for the year ended September came to $37.32 million, down from $55.97 million a year earlier. The company declared a dividend of half a cent per share. The counter closed half a cent lower at 34 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Since 2009, Geodis has been leasing space at GLP Park Pudong Heqing in Shanghai.\n\n\"We have been very satisfied with their extensive network, high-quality facilities and professional service. GLP is the first place we look when we expand in China,\" SK Yeung, managing director of Geodis Wilson Greater China, said.\n\nMeanwhile, the launch of GLP's China-focused logistics infrastructure fund (CLF Fund 1) will be transformational for the company.\n\nThe fund, which is the largest of its type in the world, is focused on the development of logistics infrastructure in China. GLP will seed the fund with land to support 1.8 million sq m of leasable area. In addition, a US$1 billion credit facility has been secured from China Merchants Bank to fund development activity in China.\n\nAs the asset manager, GLP will retain a 56 per cent stake in the fund. Equity commitments to the fund stand at US$1.5 billion, with a total investment capacity of US$3 billion over a period of three years.\n\nFollowing the launch of the fund and the recently announced sale of nine properties to GLP J-Reit, GLP's fund management platform stands at US$11.4 billion of assets under management, up from US$2.6 billion a year ago.\n\nOn the portfolio front, China registered a strong quarter of leasing in Q2, with 575,000 sq m of new and expansion leases, up 60 per cent year-on-year. Rent grew 6.9 per cent on renewals while average rental rates increased 5.0 per cent year-on-year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Mid-term elections will also play out in the United States, as will the parliamentary elections for the European Union (EU).\n\nMr Franklin said that incumbent governments are in a shaky position in some of these countries, and fringe parties have emerged and could do well. In India, for instance, firebrand opposition leader Narendra Modi could become the country's next prime minister.\n\n\"He is undoubtedly a controversial figure and will certainly shake things up in India,\" said Mr Franklin.\n\nThe political and social unrest that erupted this year in countries such as Brazil and Turkey is likely to spill over into the new year. The Economist expects more countries than before to make it to its 2014 \"Most Risky List\", a ranking of social-unrest hotspots.\n\n\"The reasons for this are many, but include the impact of the austerity and recession, as well as dissatisfaction with mainstream politics,\" said Mr Franklin.\n\nMajor shifts are also likely on the economic front next year, with a lot of good news expected to come from the rich world rather than the emerging markets.\n\n\"Since the economic crisis (of 2009), the rich world has been in huge trouble and the emerging world has been the dynamo (of growth). Now, a number of emerging economies are experiencing a difficult period - and this is certainly true for places like Brazil and India,\" Mr Franklin suggested.\n\nBut the US economy is doing better. It is tipped to do well next year, helped in part by its banking system remaining resilient to shocks from the eurozone.\n\nJapan's prospects for the year also appear brighter, boosted by Abenomics; even Europe is growing, albeit slowly.\n\nInterestingly, another factor working in favour of the US economy's resurgence is the emergence of shale gas as a major energy source. Mr Franklin said that besides making a difference to the cost of production in the US, it will make the US a net energy exporter - zipping ahead of Russia and also Saudi Arabia as the world's overall largest energy producer, taking into account both oil and gas.\n\nThis will trigger knock-on effects in the US economy and provide a psychological boost to the country's overall resilience.\n\nThe Economist expects that investment interest will rediscover the rich world as an attractive destination, rather than send funds into emerging markets. This will be important for countries such as Singapore, which is very sensitive to trends in global trade, he said.\n\nThe magazine predicts that Singapore will grow by 3.8 per cent next year, as a resurgence among the advanced economies bump up global trade volumes, even though Asia may slow down.\n\nTopping the list of big sporting shows next year is the football World Cup hosted by Brazil. Russia will host the Winter Olympics and Scotland, the Commonwealth Games.\n\nMr Franklin believes that while the Winter Olympics will be Russian President Vladimir Putin's opening to showcase his country to the world, all eyes will be on Brazil's big event. Cynics have questioned the samba nation's ability to host the event - not least because of its poor infrastructure and social unrest - but Mr Franklin is confident that the South American nation will be able to pull it off.\n\nHe is, however, doubtful that the country's success with the World Cup will be enough to save Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff's job when the country holds its elections next year - even if there may be some economic returns from the huge investments the country made to host the soccer extravaganza.\n\nMr Franklin, also the editor of The Economist's World in 2014, was in Singapore to host and speak at a gala dinner to launch the publication.\n\nAsked for his tip on who will win the World Cup next year, the Briton confidently predicted that England - no surprises here - will lift the trophy.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In fact, many will struggle to even pinpoint it on a world map.\n\nIt is South Sudan, going by The Economist's Top Growers for 2014 list. Occupying the top spot, this landlocked East African economy, which depends on oil for reportedly more than 90 per cent of its revenue, is predicted to grow its gross domestic product (GDP) by 35 per cent.\n\nThe resumption of oil production earlier this year - after it was halted in January 2012 over a disagreement with Sudan, from which it split in 2011 - will be a huge boost to its economic growth.\n\nRanked second on the magazine's 2014 list of 12 runaway economies is Mongolia, expected to clock another double-digit year with 15.3 per cent growth, buoyed by a mining boom.\n\nAnd third is Macau, projected to achieve 13.5 per cent GDP growth thanks to its gaming and tourism revenues.\n\nIndeed, The Economist's list features mostly resource-rich developing or until recently war-torn countries that one would not usually associate with high economic growth.\n\nSpeaking at The Economist's The World in 2014 gala dinner in Singapore on Tuesday, Mongolia's President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj expressed confidence that his country would continue to record sterling growth next year and thereafter, having already grown 17 per cent last year and 13 per cent this year.\n\n\"The World Bank and IMF (International Monetary Fund) predict that Mongolia can keep that pace of two-digit growth for the coming 20 years,\" he said.\n\nThe most surprising omission from the 2014 list was China, absent for the first time. Its GDP growth next year will not be shabby - at 7.3 per cent - but is still not good enough for it to be among the 12 fastest-growing economies.\n\nIts maturing, slower-growing and middle-income economy is on a general downward trend as a new generation of leaders shifts the country from a focus on low-value-added exports and government stimulus to a self-sustaining economy powered by consumer demand, The Economist said.\n\nChina's Special Administrative Region of Macau sticks out among the top three for being neither resource-rich nor energy-producing, but its casino and tourism industries are expected to hum.\n\nAnother economy of note on the list is Bhutan, which is projected to grow by 9 per cent. More popularly known for its Gross National Happiness than its GDP, its economy is expected to do well from its hydroelectricity exports to India.\n\nAlthough Singapore did not make it into the list of 12 for 2014, it is expected to achieve a sustainable growth rate of 3.8 per cent next year. The Economist expects the trend of rising trade within Asia, which has helped Singapore grow even as Western economies have struggled, to be rebalanced next year as emerging economies slow down and developed economies recover. It will be Singapore's opening to reap dividends from the surge in global trade.\n\nThe magazine said of Singapore: \"Manufacturing, though less significant than in most Asian countries, will remain a force behind growth, and the economy will continue the climb back towards its robust growth rates of old.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is the first time that the URA has attempted this with two adjacent parcels, although, it had earlier this year conducted simultaneous tender closings for three executive condominium (EC) sites. The three EC sites were in different areas - two in Punggol and one located near Jurong Country Club.\n\nThe top bid for both sites was put up by Kingsford Development, at $522.43 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr), which translates into $258.8 million for Parcel A and $201.6 million for Parcel B.\n\nParcel A has a land area of 165,125 sq ft and is located next to Rio Vista condo, while Plot B has a land area of 128,644 sq ft.\n\nKingsford Development beat the second highest bids for Parcel A and Parcel B by 16 per cent and 12.7 per cent respectively.\n\n\"While the bids seem bullish amid current buying sentiment, it indicates the developer's intention to land bank, to cement its position, and to minimise price competition it could potentially face in the vicinity,\" said Chia Siew Chuin, director of research and advisory at Colliers International.\n\nKnight Frank Singapore's research head, Alice Tan, had pointed out earlier that there were currently eight private housing projects being built within a two-kilometre radius of the two sites. As at end-September, when the sites were launched, about 85 per cent of the total 4,840 units from the eight projects had been sold.\n\nNotably, both parcels drew bids from five common participants, namely Kingsford Development, EL Development, Meteorite Land Singapore, MCL Land (Brighton), and a joint-venture between Verwood Holdings, Intrepid Investments and TID Residential.\n\nAccording to Joseph Tan, executive director, residential, at CBRE, the differential between the top bid and the second highest bid for both plots is \"not surprising\", given that Kingsford Development is a \"fairly new entrant who wants to compete with mainstream developers to shore up their landbank\".\n\nThat being said, the latest tender result shows a trend of foreign developers continuing to outbid local players, pointed out Christine Li, head of research at Orange Tee.\n\n\"One of the reasons could be the continued availability of liquidity in the financial market which encourages foreign players to take on higher risks,\" she suggested.\n\nBased on Kingsford Development's website, the developer is based in Shenyang, China. Given that the real estate market in Shenyang has slowed down quite significantly over recent years, this move could be read as Kingsford diversifying their real estate portfolio outside its home country, she added.\n\nWhile Kingsford Development has been relatively active in recent land tenders here - it also bid in the last EC site tenders where all three parcels closed on the same day - it is probably best known for winning the site at Hillview Avenue, which was subsequently developed into the 512-unit Kingsford @ Hillview Peak.\n\nParcel A's second highest bid was put up by EL Development, at $450.36 psf ppr. The lowest bid was put up by CEL Residential Development, at $321.33 psf ppr.\n\nParcel B's second highest bid was put up by Maxdin and SingHaiyi Residences ($463.52 psf ppr), while the lowest bid for the parcel was put up by MCL Land (Brighton), at $318.96 psf ppr.\n\nColliers' Ms Chia estimated the breakeven cost for the proposed developments on both sites to be in the range of $860 to $920 psf. As such, the selling price could start from $1,000 psf.\n\nOrange Tee's Ms Li said that she expects the developer to sell its projects from $1,050 psf. Currently, transactions in the vicinity range from $950 to $1,000 psf.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Tomorrow, investors will be able to check if they have unclaimed assets at the www.sgx.com/mygateway website, using their NRIC or passport number. Investors can also call 6589-8039 during office hours on weekdays and on Saturday morning.\n\n\"We are highlighting this as part of our investor-education efforts,\" said SGX head of sales and clients Chew Sutat yesterday.\n\n\"Many investors in Singapore have a short-term trading mentality. They don't think about dividends,\" he added.\n\nUnclaimed dividends come about when investors do not opt for them to be directly credited to their bank accounts, preferring instead to receive a cheque in the mail. About one in four investors have not signed up for SGX's direct crediting service.\n\nThe investors then forget that they have cheques to be cashed. For example, one investor had travelled often and did not have time to open his letters.\n\nAnother investor, retiree Madam Loh, 65, told SGX that she did not pay much attention to her investments over the years and had missed the cheques.\n\nThousands of shareholders do not cash their dividend cheques every year, SGX said.\n\nBut after six years, unclaimed dividends will be returned to the listed companies which distributed them. Currently, SGX is holding on to $53.7 million of dividends for 74,000 investors - around $726 per investor on average.\n\nSGX said most investors with unclaimed dividends have less than $1,000 to claim back. Five per cent have unclaimed dividends of between $1,000 and $5,000, and 2 per cent have more than $5,000 of unclaimed dividends. One investor has unclaimed dividends of $1.2 million.\n\nMeanwhile, SGX is also holding on to $14.6 million of unclaimed SingTel shares and dividends belonging to 15,000 investors without Central Depository (CDP) accounts.\n\nThe telco had held its initial public offering (IPO) in 1993, and Singaporeans could buy shares using their Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings. But some did not follow through after the IPO to open a CDP account.\n\nIn the 20 years since 1993, after the shares were placed to Singaporeans at $2 a share, SingTel had paid out dividends of about $2.50 per share and it is currently trading at about $3.70 a share - an annualised return of almost 6 per cent a year, Mr Chew noted.\n\nDue to privacy laws, SGX cannot approach brokers or CPF Board to get the latest contact details of the investors.\n\nIn some cases, SGX just has their NRIC numbers. In the last few months, however, it has managed to contact some and return $4 million of unclaimed assets.\n\nDavid Gerald, CEO and president of investor lobby group Securities Investors Associations of Singapore (Sias), said it is encouraging to hear of real-life examples of investors who invested in shares for the long run and enjoyed good returns.\n\n\"Share investing is a crucial part of financial planning, and investors should monitor their company's corporate actions and developments,\" he noted.\n\nThe site and hotline to check for unclaimed assets will begin operating today at 8.30am. SGX will waive the administrative fee for the reissuance of dividend cheques and dividend crediting until Jan 26, 2014.\n\nClarification: In the above story, we gave the wrong impression that some unclaimed SingTel shares were bought with Central Provident Fund monies. The Singapore Exchange has pointed out that the affected shares were bought with cash only, which means the CPF Board is not involved in any way.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Simple. They are enjoyable to drink, with or without food. What makes them enjoyable is the real question. \"What makes them lovely to drink - at least to me?\" Not as easy to answer as it looks. We drink wine to accompany a meal, or we drink it (often) for the sheer pleasure of drinking a good, or hopefully, a great wine. The pleasure comes from a combination of the taste on the palate and the aromas which waft upwards from the rear of the nasopharynx into the nose, as well as the cerebral from the barrage of messages emanating from the sensory receptors in the mouth and nasopharynx. On occasion, this barrage can be quite overwhelming. It can reduce you to a humble silence or even to tears.\n\nA wine does not need to be great or even \"near-great\" to be a likable drink. Even the simplest of wines such as a Mouton Cadet, can be a nice drink - it is easy to understand why, because this wine like others in the same genre is commercially produced to a fixed style and quality. You cannot go wrong. Better than nothing - unless it has suffered from poor storage.\n\nFreshness, fruit, balance, harmony and finally finesse - if all these attributes check out as expected, the wine should appeal. Not necessarily. The other night I had a glass of a New World Sauvignon Blanc, no it was not Cloudy Bay but from around there, and it was so pronouncedly New World sauvignon blanc, \"Chinese gooseberry\" that it was like wearing it as a badge.\n\nIt was well made, in fact rather pleasant to drink notwithstanding that New World SB is not my favourite grape. I just happen to find the strong, rather penetrating, aroma of New World Sauvignon Blanc not particularly attractive, a little too much of a good thing. It is a familiar sensory or cortical phenomenon (I am not sure which or a combination of both) that there are some initial \"favourites\" which one tires of in time.\n\nWe do not drink wine by \"numbers\". Most certainly not by \"scores\". One's overall sensory reception accompanied by the cerebral interpretation and evaluation combine to produce an impression either favourable, or otherwise. One makes a recording cerebrally, registering the overall effect and score, hopefully consigned to long-term memory.\n\nWhat about fruit? We expect ripe fruit, perfectly ripened fruit, and that the vinification was according to acceptable practice and standards. Sometimes the vagaries of the weather during the growing or the ripening periods may result in uneven ripening of the fruit, this being something over which the winemaker has no control. BUT he can control the selection of the fruit, discarding unevenly ripened fruit and concentrating on or near fully 100 per cent ripe fruit. And the degree to which such selection is made is a function of the standard to which the grower aims. Perfection is expensive.\n\nI place great store on the freshness of a wine. It is the most important quality, even above colour and aroma. Without freshness the aroma, taste, length etc. have no foundation. Absent or deficient freshness are warning signs. Poor quality or poor storage. Exactly the same as the quality you look for when you buy seafood! Except that it is evaluated in a different way. With fish you check on the smell, the feel of the flesh. At least, that was how I was taught when I had to cycle to the fresh-foods market during the Japanese occupation of Singapore!\n\nThe freshness referred to in connection with wine is the same kind of mouth-feel that one gets after eating a perfectly ripe, juicy orange. The whole mouth is left feeling clean, refreshed and even tingling, just impatiently waiting for the next mouthful. It makes you reflexively reach out for the glass to take another swallow, to repeat the experience, to convince yourself that it is real.\n\nAs to whether \"freshness\" is a function of the presence or absence of acidity or minerality is a debate I am not qualified to answer. Adequate level of acidity is certainly needed but acidity by itself is not the full answer.\n\nMinerality has been cited. The trouble with that is the definition of minerality. Sometimes, one reads that minerality refers to the content of traces of metal in the wine, especially if it is known that the vines have been grown on soil containing good amounts of minerals - calcium, iron, etc. One of the difficulties readers (me amongst them) have is to grasp the meaning of some highly imaginative descriptive phrases used in some wine notes about the taste of iron in the wine. Not having ever licked on an iron rod makes it difficult to describe what it tastes like!\n\nAfter freshness, the other attributes are simpler. Density, concentration, balance and harmony and finally the finish. A few days ago I opened a bottle of Propriedad 2003, Palacios Remondo, the Rioja wine made by Alvaro Palacios, who has now taken over the family winery in Rioja, Baja. With a cepage of Tempranillo principally, with Garnacha, Mazuelo and Graciano, it is an attractive easy-drinking wine. Lots of fruit, very ripe and lush, with very pleasing freshness on the palate and good acidity.\n\nThere was good density and concentration of fruit, and a medium finish. It did show some complexity but it finished short on the middle palate. It was well-made, it was an attractive drink and left the palate sufficiently refreshed, but in the end it lacked sufficient interest. The remaining one-third of wine in the bottle was re-corked and drunk a few days later. It had faded. A good but not a great bottle, not meant for long ageing. A simple bottle made to give pleasure, for easy and early drinking especially with meals.\n\nNot that there is anything wrong with the wine. Propriedad and lots of wines like it are inexpensive, good everyday-drinking wines, giving pleasure and doing what they are meant to do, but ageing into complex wines is not their function.\n\n\"In some bottles there is the soil of a place, and in that soil, there is a soul\" - Roger Scruton. Propriedad may not qualify to be included in \"some bottles\" but it has its place as a nice wine for a simple dinner.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Another sold food packaging. Two were sisters-in-law of an insurance executive who died in the World Trade Center on Sept 11, 2001.\n\nWith no Washington experience or deep-pocketed backers, these family members of victims of a 2009 plane crash near Buffalo, New York, channelled their grief and rage for four years to win US rules reducing pilot fatigue and improving training and qualifications. They outmanoeuvred industry opponents spending millions on lobbyists.\n\nThe rules, the last of which was announced by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Nov 5, will cost airlines US$7 billion over 10 years to add training, hire more pilots and adjust flight schedules, according to government estimates.\n\n\"We learned and realised very early on that you're not going to go cry on someone's desk and get something done,\" Scott Maurer, a regional sales manager at Sealed Air Corp whose daughter Lorin, 30, died in the crash, said in an interview. \"You have to have a plan and you have to conduct it in a business-like manner.\"\n\nA core of 5-10 family members, aided by an extended circle that swelled to as many as 40, bird- dogged lawmakers and agency heads until they got what they wanted, according to interviews with five participants as well as politicians and government officials.\n\nSome members of Families of Continental Flight 3407 came to Washington more than 60 times, paying their own way.\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) chairman Deborah Hersman, whose job includes working with crash survivors, said she'd never seen such persistent advocacy by families.\n\n\"They opened up people's minds, and they opened up offices, and they opened up priorities that even the NTSB probably couldn't have,\" she said in an interview.\n\nFlight 3407, operated by Pinnacle Airlines Corp's Colgan unit, was nearing Buffalo from Newark, New Jersey, at 10:17pm on Feb 12, 2009, when it pitched up violently. The plane slowed, lost lift and plunged into a neighbourhood in Clarence Center, New York. All 49 people aboard and a man on the ground died.\n\nThe investigation at first focused on the snow falling that night and other pilot reports of icing.\n\nThe families heard a different story after arriving at an NTSB hearing starting May 12, 2009: a captain with a history of failing skill tests who'd barely slept the night before triggered the accident by overreacting to a cockpit alarm. The co-pilot had earned US$16,000 the prior year and taken a red-eye flight the night before reporting to work.\n\nConvinced there were systemic safety shortfalls in the regional-airline industry, the families that week fanned out across the halls of Congress, a five-minute taxi ride from the NTSB's conference room.\n\nOne of their first meetings was with Senator Byron Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat who was chairman of the aviation rulemaking subcommittee.\n\nMr Dorgan told them about his mother, who was killed by a drunk driver in 1986, the now-former lawmaker said in an interview. As the driver's case wound through court, Mr Dorgan attended every hearing to send a message, he said.\n\n\"My advice is you've got to show up,\" he told the group. \"The world is run by those who show up. And show up at everything.\" So they did.\n\nLed by Kevin Kuwik, a buzz-cut assistant basketball coach at the University of Dayton who won a Bronze Star for Army service in Iraq, they became experts in the minutiae of influence and the technical side of airline operations.\n\nMr Kuwik's girlfriend was Mr Maurer's daughter Lorin. His father, Edward, was mayor of the western New York town of Lackawanna and served in the Erie County legislature. That gave the group contacts with the Buffalo area's congressional delegation and with Senator Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat who ranked third in the body's leadership.\n\nThe two sisters brought their own connections. Karen Eckert and Susan Bourque lost their sibling, Beverly Eckert, an advocate for Sept 11, 2001 attack victims who had met only days before the accident with President Barack Obama.\n\nMs Beverly Eckert, whose husband, Sean Rooney, died in one of the World Trade Center towers, served on the Family Steering Committee of the 9/11 Commission and was a familiar figure on Capitol Hill.\n\nStaff members would say hello to Susan and Karen because they looked so much like their golden-haired sister and offer to assist, the sisters said.\n\n\"When we did get to see the member of Congress and talked about Beverly, they always had nice things to say,\" Ms Bourque said. \"It really helped.\"\n\nEven as doors opened, roadblocks appeared. While the House had passed an aviation safety bill by a 409-to-11 vote in October 2009, the measure stalled in the Senate.\n\nAirlines and their trade groups began lobbying to mute the measures, according to reports and public filings.\n\nThe Regional Airline Association, the Washington-based trade group representing carriers like Colgan, hadn't lobbied since 1999. In 2010, it spent US$160,000 lobbying on the safety measures and other issues, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington.\n\nLarger carriers such as FedEx Corp and American Airlines parent AMR Corp, along with their Washington-based trade group, Airlines for America, reported spending more than US$50 million on lobbying in 2010. All the carriers said they lobbied on the safety proposals without detailing how much was spent on specific issues.\n\nWhile the airlines said they supported improved safety and pilot training, they argued in government filings that measures sought by the families would be too costly and wouldn't have prevented the crash.\n\nGoing against such well-financed opposition, the families found they could wield their own brand of political muscle.\n\nThe regulations that emerged addressed what the families saw as the biggest issues underlying the Colgan crash: old rules that allowed pilots to fly tired, outdated training requirements and standards that allowed pilots to carry passengers after failing skill tests. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

A number of KL high-end, high-rise properties have been going at more than RM1,000 psf.\n\nThe steep price increase in such a short period may not be sustainable for a number of reasons, including the lack of commerce in Johor Baru. To date the bulk of Iskandar investments has been centred on real estate as developers from Kuala Lumpur as well as overseas made a beeline for the new hotspot.\n\nTake Country Garden Holdings which acquired 22.25 hectares in Danga Bay for nearly RM1 billion. In August, it launched with much fanfare its integrated development which has an estimated gross development value of RM18 billion.\n\nIt put up a large portion of the development for sale - a method used by developers in mainland China - selling 6,000 units, or about two-thirds of the 9,000 apartments, within a month. Malaysian media reported that at least one in four buyers is from China.\n\nWith the pipeline of units coming from Country Garden and other developers in the next two to three years, people are beginning to see Iskandar as more of a \"property play\".\n\nRHB pinpointed Medini as likely to experience a slowdown in home sales in the near term as buyers react in knee-jerk fashion to the property cooling measures.\n\nStill, the node may not be very badly affected given the many incentives and exemptions accorded to it by the federal government. Current exemptions include bumiputra quotas, and minimum price restriction for foreigners. Medini property buyers could also be excluded from paying RPGT if the Iskandar Regional Development Authority is successful in pushing for an exemption to ensure the special node continues to be favoured by investors.\n\nThere is no denying that the tighter guidelines in Budget 2014 have had a dampening effect as purchasers exercise more caution but RHB said the RPGT was \"still bearable\" for locals since the 30 per cent maximum rate only applies for disposals within the first three years. It noted, however, that some consolidation in property demand and prices can be expected. Based on past experience, the market could take a quarter or two to adjust to the regulatory changes.\n\nThe research house has singled out UEM Sunrise, Sunway and Mah Sing as property companies under its coverage with the biggest exposure to Iskandar in terms of gross domestic value and landbank area.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the coming months, investors should look out for more cues on the state of the US economy, including the next FOMC statement, when making decisions on asset allocation.\"\n\nKoo Chung Chang, Life Insurance Association representative, said: \"In the short term, markets will continue to remain volatile, driven by economic data coming through as well as any indication of QE tapering or the lack thereof. Investors could consult their financial advisers periodically to review their portfolios to ensure that they remain on track to meet their long-term retirement needs.\"\n\nOver a one-year period, CPFIS-included funds posted a positive return of 9.86 per cent.

Equity funds rose 11.19 per cent; bond funds were up by 5.47 per cent; and mixed asset funds 7.86 per cent.\n\nDuring the period, three funds were newly listed on the CPFIS menu.

They face structural tasks that include melding frequent-flier plans and deciding on a regional-jet fleet, as well as details such as picking an aircraft paint scheme.\n\nAmerican will need to avoid technological pitfalls like the computer failures that snarled flights at United Continental Holdings Inc after its 2010 tie-up, while also making good on a pledge to achieve US$1 billion in cost savings and new revenue. The closing of the US$17.7 billion merger and AMR's Chapter 11 exit will come on Dec 9, the company said on Wednesday.\n\n\"What we'll see is the beginning of announcements of what the integration teams have been putting together,\" said George Hamlin, president of Hamlin Transportation Consulting in Fairfax, Virginia. \"Doug Parker's team has been quite eager to consummate the merger for some time.\"\n\nMr Parker, 52, began pursuing American shortly after the carrier's bankruptcy filing on Nov 29, 2011. Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR agreed to the merger in February, and the airlines worked towards a September closing until the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit to block the deal on Aug 13. A settlement in that case was reached on Nov 12, and US Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane in Manhattan approved that accord on Wednesday.\n\nInvestors will be among the first to feel the effect of the new company's arrival. The combined carrier will become American Airlines Group Inc on Dec 9, and the shares will be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market with the ticker AAL.\n\nEquity in the merged airline will be distributed then, with 72 per cent going to AMR creditors, including stakes totalling 23.6 per cent for American employees and management, and at least 3.5 per cent for existing AMR shareholders. Stockholders in Tempe, Arizona-based US Airways will get the rest.\n\nPay raises and other contract changes agreed to earlier for all employees will take effect that day as well, as part of the merger agreement the airlines unveiled in February.\n\nSome changes visible to travellers, such as combining loyalty programmes, won't come for months. For example, United, formed in the October 2010 merger of UAL Corp and Continental Airlines Inc, didn't have a unified website until March 2012.\n\nOther steps, including US Airways' shift to the American-led Oneworld marketing group from Star Alliance, should happen during the first quarter, according to the airlines.\n\n\"I suspect they are going to go dark for a while until they have something to talk to the consumer about,\" said Jay Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive who now runs Shorewood, Wisconsin-based aviation consultant IdeaworksCompany. \"Right now they don't. To talk in that situation creates nothing but problems for customer-facing processes.\"\n\nAmerican and US Airways will take \"the first step in being a single airline for customers\" on Jan 7, US Airways president Scott Kirby said on a Nov 12 conference call. \"We're going to have a more seamless customer interface\" to announce that day, he said, without providing specifics.\n\nTodd Lehmacher, a US Airways spokesman, and Mike Trevino with American, declined to provide a timetable for the integration or discuss what the airline will announce on Jan 7.\n\nOne early move will be the sharing of airline booking codes so the carriers can put travellers onto each other's flights. Later, fliers will be able to earn and redeem reward miles on either airline before a single programme is created when American and US Airways begin operating as one carrier.\n\n\"'You want your miles in our family' is the message,\" Mr Hamlin said in an interview. \"They'll say, 'We're about to begin a new year and you need to put your miles in at least one of them' because, hopefully by the end of 2014, the programmes will be together.\"\n\nIn airline mergers, frequent fliers typically have their miles rolled together into one account at the surviving carrier.\n\nAmerican and US Airways will function separately until the Federal Aviation Administration approves unified operations, probably near the end of 2014. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The sub-committee is led by Quek See Tiat, chairman of the Building and Construction Authority.\n\nThe sub-committee reviewed the Code, which was issued here in 2009 and based on the Code of Ethics issued in 2006 by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA) of the International Federation of Accountants.\n\nThe IESBA Code was revised in 2009, and the consultation paper noted that some audit firms in Singapore already ensure that their procedures comply with the revised IESBA Code as part of their internal controls.\n\nThe sub-committee said that it was looking to adopt all the revisions in the revised IESBA Code to \"maintain respected international benchmarks in Singapore\".\n\nIt is also looking to retain and remove some of the Singapore provisions. In considering these, its approach has been to adopt the revised IESBA Code as far as possible and move away from local modifications except where there is an identified deficiency or where the Singapore provision is needed to provide certainty.\n\nThe consultation paper is available on ACRA's website (www.acra.gov.sg).\n\nThe public consultation exercise runs from Nov 29, 2013, until Jan 10, 2014.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The homes were built from 2007 through 2011, he said, without disclosing their value.\n\n\"This type of sale is going to be our typical bread and butter in years to come,\" Mr Barba said.\n\nThe rental market in Spain, which has one of Europe's highest home ownership rates, may double in coming years as government spending cuts, a 26 per cent jobless rate and subdued mortgage lending make it more difficult for Spaniards to buy dwellings, according to Irea, a debt-restructuring firm that has advised on 22 billion euros (S$37.3 billion) of refinancing.\n\nIncreasing demand for rental properties is prompting foreign funds to invest in Spain's unsold homes, which may total 1.3 million units, according to Idealista.com, the country's largest real estate website. New York-based Blackstone Group LP, which has bought about 40,000 homes in the US, agreed in July to purchase 18 apartment blocks from the city of Madrid for 125.5 million euros. New York-based Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Madrid-based Azora Capital SL agreed in August to pay about 20 per cent more than the minimum asking price for 32 social-housing developments sold by Madrid's regional government.\n\n\"There are very good investors for this type of product and we've already seen purchases by Blackstone and Goldman,\" Mr Barba said.\n\nHIG Capital LLC, a Miami-based private-equity firm, agreed in August to buy a majority stake in a portfolio of around 1,000 homes from Sareb. The transaction, known as Project Bull, valued them at about 100 million euros.\n\nNot all of the sales have gone smoothly. Blackstone, the world's largest private- equity firm, and Goldman dropped out of an auction for 1,458 homes in Madrid, leaving them unsold, two people with knowledge of the matter said. Funds are being selective, focusing on homes with tenants and rental income in urban areas like Madrid, Fernando Encinar, co-founder of Idealista.com, said in an interview in September.\n\nThe investors' strategies in Spain differ from the US, where they have targeted mainly foreclosed single- family properties, renovated them and sought tenants. In both countries, they're aiming to buy cheaply and bet on increased rental demand as more people struggle to qualify for mortgages.\n\nSareb failed to attract high enough bids for its Corona office portfolio, its first attempt to sell commercial real estate assets, and cut the size of the package offered from seven to four to make it easier to sell, three people familiar with the matter said last month.\n\nSpain set up Sareb last year to absorb 50.8 billion euros in real estate assets from lenders including the Bankia group, which took state aid. Sareb may close the sale of Corona this year after choosing two bidders to submit binding offers by the end of next week, Mr Barba said. Madrid-based Aguirre Newman SA is advising Sareb on the sale of the portfolio of office buildings in central Madrid.\n\nSareb has raised 1.7 billion euros so far this year, beating its 2013 target of 1.5 billion euros, Deputy Economy Minister Fernando Jimenez Latorre said at a conference in Madrid last week. Mr Barba declined to give an asset-sales target for next year.\n\nSareb also has sold its Abacus portfolio and other loans with a combined nominal value of 323 million euros to Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank AG. It's currently in talks to sell debt with a nominal value of 440 million euros in Madrid-based real estate developer Realia Business SA to New York-based Fortress Investment Group LLC. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

Valuer Jones Lang LaSalle will value Tianda and issue a report in due course, Pteris said.\n\nLike its purchase of the previous stake in Tianda, Pteris will issue new shares to satisfy the deal, after the proposed consolidation of five shares, at 13 cents each, into one. Post-consolidation, shares will be issued at 65 cents apiece.\n\nUnder the terms of the reverse takeover, Pteris will issue 230.8 million pre-consolidation shares amounting to $30 million. Another $7.2 million will be raised at a later date, subject to various conditions including profitability.\n\nAnother $3 million is to be satisfied by the issuance of shares subject to the result of ongoing arbitration proceedings involving Pteris and a Middle East project. The final $1.1 million will be satisfied, subject to the settlement of claims relating to outstanding payments due from third parties.\n\nPteris used to be known as Inter-Roller Engineering Limited, and was a market darling. At its height, shares traded over $1.30 each in 2007. But in 2008, it made a net loss of $3.1 million, hit by higher costs and project delays. In 2012, Pteris was also hit by a volatile global economy and project delays, reporting $29.6 million in losses.\n\nPteris currently runs baggage handling and air cargo handling systems, among others. It posted a loss of $12.6 million for the first nine months of the year, down from a loss of $23.2 million a year ago.\n\nRevenue fell 35 per cent to $32.8 million from $50.6 million a year earlier. The company had cash and equivalents of $11.1 million as at end-September.\n\nWhen the reverse takeover was announced, some shareholders had grumbled about the valuation.\n\nPteris' net asset value stood at 9.6 cents a share as at end-September, or $52.7 million. The terms of the reverse takeover are at 13 cents a share. But in its 2012 annual report, Pteris revealed that independent valuers had revalued its leasehold building - understood to be their headquarters at 28 Quality Road - to $53 million, compared with the $18 million that the building was held at cost on its books.\n\nThis would boost its restated net asset value (RNAV) to $87.7 million, or 16 cents a share, 23 per cent higher than the RTO price. In addition, the company also has outstanding arbitration and settlement claims.\n\nWhen contacted yesterday, Pteris's second largest shareholder, non-executive director Winston Tan Tien Hin, who has a deemed stake of 10.5 per cent in the company, told The Business Times: \"The RTO pricing is too low.\" Mr Tan has been accumulating shares in the company.\n\nBut fellow shareholder, private investor Mano Sabnani, told BT that the key issue was not the valuation, but \"whether Pteris can survive on its own or whether it needs a stronger partner\".\n\n\"A smallish company incurring losses like that in a big boys' game can't survive for long,\" he said.\n\nThe RTO is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.\n\nPteris closed unchanged at 13.1 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its leaders are clear-minded about their goals, yet conscious of China's enormous challenges, and committed to reforms.\"\n\nSpeaking in Mandarin, Mr Lee also gave his take on the Third Plenum, a key Chinese policy meeting that ended earlier this month.\n\n\"Changes announced at the Third Plenum reflect the commitment of China's leaders to reforms that will sustain China's growth for the future,\" he said.\n\nBut he advised that a long-term view of China needs to be taken, as China's challenges are complex and some issues cannot be resolved in a hurry. He cited how sentiments on the meeting, as well as markets, swung from high expectations to disappointment at a vaguely worded initial communique, to praise again after a detailed reform plan was announced.\n\nThe Singapore government is continually updating and enhancing its partnership with China, he added. Companies here, meanwhile, must also adapt to China's changing needs and circumstances, he said.\n\nMr Lee cited Cordlife Group, a provider of umbilical cord blood and tissue banking services, gearing up to take advantage of the relaxation of China's one-child policy.\n\nCompanies must also develop staff to understand the language, customs, traditions and business practices of China, he said.\n\nBusiness China was set up in 2007 by Mr Lee's father, former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, and former Chinese premier Wen Jiabao to create a network for Singaporeans who can connect to China economically and culturally. Yesterday, the younger Mr Lee took over from his father to become the organisation's new patron.\n\nThe Business China Awards are jointly presented by Business China and OCBC Bank to recognise businessmen, professionals and organisations for contributing to Singapore-China relations. This year, they went to former Jiangsu province party secretary Liang Baohua, Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao, and Charles Wong, co-founder of homegrown shoe retailer Charles & Keith.\n\nMr Liang, 68, is recognised for his role as China's key representative in developing the Suzhou Industrial Park, a joint venture between Singapore and China started in 1994. Mr Liang was cited for supporting the park through thick and thin.\n\nLianhe Zaobao was honoured for becoming one of the top Chinese news websites in the world.

It is a short-term alleviation and it is no more than that,\" said Mehdi Varzi, a former official at the state-run National Iranian Oil Co.\n\nIn the meantime, Iran is deploying more vessels to help store oil at sea and to enable it to conclude discreet sales by transferring cargoes to customers' ships in mid-ocean without having to enter port, the sources say.\n\nWith its tanker fleet boosted by newly built vessels from Chinese yards, Iran is shipping crude to countries including China, India and Syria. \"Iran will try and export its crude to any country that will accept it and if that involves methods to conceal how it is done, they will do it,\" said Mr Varzi, who now runs an energy consultancy in Britain. \"Any country would do the same if they faced Iran's horrendous economic situation.\"\n\nThe deal struck in Geneva leaves US and European oil sanctions in place for six months, although an easing of a ban on European ship insurance may ease the transport of current oil exports to Iran's big Asian customers. \"They desperately need as many tankers as they can get hold of as they are producing more oil than they can shift which is a big problem for them,\" one European based trade source said.\"Iran is also trying to use vessels not previously associated with them to take the heat of their main domestic fleet.\"\n\nForeign shipping companies, fearing a loss of business in Western nations because of sanctions, have backed off from deals with Iran. This has put the onus on Iran's main tanker operator, NITC, but sanctions have restricted its access to insurance and the certification that allows its ships to call at major ports.\n\nAmong vessels now being used by Iran are some previously controlled by Irano Hind, an Indian-Iranian joint venture recently wound up due to sanctions, trade sources said. The former company's fleet included at least three oil tankers.\n\nTrade sources said one of those vessels, the Ramtin, which shipping databases showed was now Iranian-flagged, had made at least one ship-to-ship transfer off the coast of Singapore and Malaysia last month. Ship-tracking data showed the vessel had called at Iran's Larak Island oil terminal in September. Ramtin's India-based manager, Marian Ship Management, could not be reached for comment.\n\nShip-tracking information shows that Iran has aimed to provide assistance to its main regional ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, as civil war grinds on.\n\nAnother former Irano Hind vessel, the Iranian-flagged Tour 2, delivered crude oil to Syria last month, port loading and ship tracking data showed. The vessel's Iran-based owner, Auris Marine, could not be reached for comment.\n\nA further three tankers controlled by NITC also made deliveries to Syria last month, data showed.\n\nA senior NITC official told Reuters: \"We are doing the same as we have done in the past three years - transporting oil.\"\n\nSeparately, the Falcon Pride oil tanker has made regular runs between Iran's Assaluyeh anchorage to the port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), carrying Iranian light oil, known as condensate, ship tracking and trade sources said.\n\nUS and EU measures have already reduced Iran's oil exports by more than half from pre-sanction levels of about 2.2 million barrels per day, costing Iran billions of dollars in lost revenue a month. But Iranian officials say they are learning to get round sanctions, which they reject as unjustified.\n\nTrade sources said the NITC tanker Honesty made a ship-to-ship (STS) transfer with a foreign-owned vessel in September in an STS area within Dubai's anchorage waters. \"STS transfers around the UAE are another method to offload oil. Whether the oil is immediately sold or held until a buyer can be found depends on the deal but it gets a cargo off their hands,\" a Middle East based trade source said.\n\nA source at Dubai's Maritime City Authority said the port's priority was ensuring there were no accidents or pollution in its waters and it did not check the source of the oil.\n\nThe NITC official, who declined to be named, said the group were not doing many STS operations these days. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The Chinese \"bad bank\", which is revving up for a Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO), has recently been doing brisk business by borrowing cheaply from other banks and using those funds to buy up companies' short-term loans to each other. In doing so, it has found a way to square China's dreaded \"debt triangles\".\n\nCinda was originally set up to take on bad loans racked up by China Construction Bank. In recent years, however, it has made an increasing amount of its money by restructuring inter-company debt. It's the only one of China's four bad banks which is allowed to buy debt from non-financial companies. These kinds of assets have grown from nothing three years ago to the majority of its distressed debt holdings at the end of June.\n\nHere's how it works: First, Cinda borrows from a bank, typically for around 5-6 per cent, according to people familiar with the situation. It then finds a company with a customer which can't pay its trade bills - say, a cement maker that is owed cash by a real estate developer. Cinda buys that receivable for a small discount to its face value. The developer puts up collateral or secures a third-party guarantee, and its debt to the cement maker becomes a loan from Cinda.\n\nEveryone seems to gain. The cement maker gets its cash back and the developer buys itself some time - though at a price. Cinda's loans carry an average interest rate of around 14 per cent, according to the company's IPO prospectus.\n\nAfter deducting expenses and bad-debt provisions equivalent to around 2 per cent of the loan, Cinda emerges with roughly a 6 per cent spread - more than twice what Chinese banks earn on traditional lending. Because Cinda's own balance sheet is leveraged, it earns an attractive return on equity of around 30 per cent.\n\nCompanies aren't the only ones taking advantage of Cinda's strategy. Some \"trust\" vehicles, which gather and reinvest funds from the wealthy, have brought in the bad bank to help them pay back investors when developers which have borrowed from the trusts get into trouble. That exposes Cinda to the risk it gets stuck with collateral such as land and buildings, but having its own real estate division at least means it can put those to use.\n\nThe mystery is why China's banks don't get into this lucrative game themselves. One reason may be that many of the afflicted companies are real estate developers, and regular lenders are under orders to limit their exposure to the industry.\n\nAnother is that banks would rather lend to Cinda, since they can class such loans as \"interbank\" exposures. These incur a lower capital charge than corporate credits, and aren't included in banks' loan-to-deposit ratios, which are capped by regulators.\n\nMoreover, structuring these loans is time-consuming, and requires expertise that China's commercial lenders don't readily have. Even Cinda currently goes mainly for large receivables - its restructured assets are on average around 100-200 million yuan (S$20-40 million) each.\n\nFrom an economic perspective, the Cinda model is basically helpful, since it eases one of China's most worrying trends: companies racking up debt to each other in the form of unpaid bills. Accounts receivable among Chinese companies have grown substantially faster than GDP since 2010, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. If the cement maker gets its cash back from the property developer, it is more likely to pay its own suppliers and lenders, and the risk of contagion is reduced.\n\nCan this profitable trade continue? It can so long as China's financial system remains essentially closed. First, banks have to keep supplying Cinda with cheap loans. That, in turn, means they must be able to draw on their own cheap funds - most notably consumer deposits. As China's market develops, and new funds offer savers alluring alternatives, that sure source of low-cost funding will fade. But for the foreseeable future, depositors will keep unwittingly funding troubled companies' bailouts - and Cinda's earnings.\n\nThe writer is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.\n\nThe opinions expressed are his own.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price in debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:21 PM\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nJane Street deposits US$567 million so it can resume India trading\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:48 PM\n\nBank of Japan is said likely to consider raising inflation forecast\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLG Electronics shares jump on report of AI chip gear development\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:27 AM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM", "images": []}

We have not been affected and everyone can still move around town as usual.\"\n\nTom Ng, director of Tong Seng Produce, which imports 40 per cent of its rice from Thailand, said that his company was on standby to turn to other markets should supply be affected at any time.\n\nAmong Tong Seng's many products is the Songhe brand of rice, which is harvested all year from north-east Thailand.\n\n\"Our suppliers in Thailand have not informed us of any impact to our supply. In any case, we have many alternatives such as rice from Vietnam, India, Japan and the US. We can increase our imports from those countries even at short notice, to make up for any shortfall,\" he said.\n\nThis week's protests in Bangkok are the largest since tens of thousands took to the streets in 2010 to protest against the previous government of former premier Abhisit Vejjajiva. That year, more than 90 people died and over 2,000 were injured during the unrest.\n\nYesterday, protesters stormed more government ministries and even forced the evacuation of the Department of Special Investigation, the country's top crime-fighting agency.\n\nWhile the scenes have remained largely peaceful so far, the images of flag-waving protesters and armed riot police officers - and the fact that Ms Yingluck has implemented the Internal Security Act - have spooked thousands of tourists into staying home.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, the Tourism Authority of Thailand highlighted that all tourist attractions in Bangkok remained open.\n\nBut if things get worse, it could spell trouble for the tourism industry in Thailand as the kingdom enters its peak travel season. A record 22.3 million travellers made their way to the Land of Smiles last year, with the tourism industry contributing 7.3 per cent to the nation's gross domestic product.\n\nA spokesman for Singapore Airlines (SIA) said that it has received \"a small number of calls\" from passengers keen to postpone their travel to Bangkok, which is one of the most popular travel destinations for Singaporeans. SIA flights between the two cities are operating as per normal.\n\nBudget carriers Jetstar, Tigerair and Scoot also said that flights have carried on as planned. \"In fact, flights from Singapore to Bangkok are mostly full,\" noted a Scoot spokesman.\n\nWhile passengers are presently subjected to fees if they change their travel dates, Tigerair said that it would waive this fee if the situation deteriorates and the government issues an official travel warning.\n\nMeanwhile, the airlines are advising passengers to arrive early for their flights at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport because of possible traffic congestion from the demonstrations.\n\nAccording to local travel and tour agencies Chan Brothers and Dynasty Travel, there have been no cancellations for travel plans to Bangkok as yet.\n\nChan Brothers, which has six travellers in Bangkok at the moment, said that tours are going ahead as planned, although customers have called to get updates on the situation.\n\nCommunications manager Jane Chang said: \"It could be most of customers are adopting a wait-and-see approach as political protests in Bangkok have been an annual affair for some time now.\"\n\nThe travel agency is also encouraging tourists to buy travel insurance and register online with Singapore's Foreign Affairs Ministry so that they can be contacted in case of an emergency. Travellers on its flexi-holiday offerings are given a 24-hour hotline number for support.\n\nThe political turmoil has played havoc with Ms Yingluck's travel plans, too. The 46-year-old leader was to have made a two-day visit to Singapore this week for a retreat with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, but this has since been postponed to next year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A man and a woman wake up in bed. He, a model husband, serves her breakfast. She, a beautiful wife, smiles gratefully. But when he leaves for work, she opens her door for another man.\n\nWhat follows afterwards is totally unexpected.\n\nWhen the husband catches them in bed together, the lover flees and leaves his suit behind. The husband, instead of showing his anger, coolly devises a plan to punish her. The suit left behind by the fleeing lover is to become the \"guest\" of the house. He wants her to talk to it, feed it, and even take it for walks.\n\nThe suit becomes a permanent reminder of her crime. Slowly but surely, it destroys the both of them. The Suit is the last title in the triumphant Three Titans of Theatre series presented by the Esplanade and the Singapore Repertory Theatre. And though it is less spectacular and showy than the series' two previous productions, Shun-kin and Musashi, The Suit haunts and taunts you in a way the other two don't. Why did the husband (played by Ivano Jeremiah) not simply lash out at his wife (Nonhlanhla Kheswa) when he first caught them? Why did he bottle up his hurt and let it gnaw at the marriage in the long run? The background for the play's psychological complexity is the apartheid era of the 1950s South Africa, and its setting of Sofiatown, a Johannesburg township, where the whites are trying to evict the blacks for living too close to the white working-class areas.\n\nThe play never makes explicit how the subjugation of black people inspired the husband - a good, honest man by anyone's yardstick - to devise a passive-aggressive punishment for his wife. But one can deduce from the few clues scattered throughout about the beatings and violence carried out by whites on the blacks.\n\nThe Suit is originally a short story by South African writer Can Themba. It has been adapted for the stage by the great English director Peter Brook. In the hands of the minimalist master, the story is told with great spareness and austerity - with a bare bones set, a cast of four actors, and three live musicians.\n\nBut this lack of embellishments helps the play achieve the opposite of what most literary adaptations are accused of: Disappointing the boundless imagination of the original stories' readers by providing in the adaptation too many visual and physical details.\n\nBrook's simplicity allows you to instead focus on and contemplate - with startling clarity - the follies of the heart.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But whether this can be sustained and become a powerful fund-raising tool for Singapore-based start-ups remains to be seen.\n\nAccording to crowdfunding platform Crowdonomic.com, a record amount of money has been raised by Singapore-based campaigns this year, and this amount doubles on a monthly basis. The number of Singapore-based supporters is growing as well.\n\nIn March, Singaporean film The Body raised US$29,050 via global platform Indiegogo. In April, senior-friendly smartphone Silverline bagged US$54,001. And the following month, US$107,730 was pledged to the S377A Constitutional Challenge.\n\nBut some observers are cautious about continued high-octane growth, citing Singapore's small market and slow adoption rates as limitations to crowdfunding's potential. But they agree there is a role for crowdfunding in Singapore as it can complement venture capitalists (VC) in supporting start-ups.\n\nCrowdfunding, which has more than 800 global online platforms today, allows anyone to raise funds for anything - profit ventures, creative ideas or personal needs - in exchange for rewards. A campaigner sets a funding goal and deadline. If people like the campaign, they can pledge money to make it happen.\n\n\"As of now, crowdfunding here is very much in its infancy stage. It is still a fairly new concept to non-techies since its introduction in 2012,\" said Kelvin Koh, co-founder of PixBento, a photo-sharing app and Singapore's top crowdfunded campaign (US$3,220 raised) on a local platform.\n\nPirate3D, having raised US$1.44 million for its 3D printer The Buccaneer, is Singapore's top crowdfunded campaign on a global platform. It is also the only Singapore-based company that earned a spot (No 20) on Entrepreneur Magazine's 2013 list of Top 100 Crowdfunded Companies.\n\n\"Apart from Pirate3D, I don't think there has been any other high-profile product or service that got funded,\" said Julian Low, entrepreneur-in-residence at Red Dot Ventures.\n\n\"Most other campaigns from Singapore have small goals attached and thus expect small successes,\" said Mohamed Rushdy, co-founder of crowdsourcing learning portal Twofold. \"Additionally, the Singapore market is far too small for a business model that crowdsources funds or talent to be sustainable.\"\n\nJeffrey Paine, founding partner at Golden Gate Ventures (GGV), agreed: \"The density of interesting projects coming from Singapore is limited.\"\n\nOne reason for this, said Mr Koh, is that software start-ups - the bulk of tech start-ups here - are unlikely to crowdfund because of the low financial requirements in building a website or app.\n\n\"Local culture also differs from that in the US. Asians in general fear failure and will perceive risks in funding an idea or project online,\" said Ben Chew, founder of HR consulting firm Startup Jobs Asia.\n\n\"I don't think crowdfunding has really even taken off in Singapore. Even within the start-up community and early adopters, the buzz is somehow missing,\" said Alok Mishra, co-founder of B2B mobile advertising app Notiphi.\n\n\"I think the problem lies in the fact that (No 1 platform) Kickstarter is a lot larger than the next biggest platform. And Kickstarter requires you to have a US or Canadian presence, so it's disadvantageous to non-Western tech companies, many of which are innovative and competent in their own right,\" Mr Low said.\n\nTo address this gap, more crowdfunding platforms have been staking their presence here to attract local campaigners. Singapore-based platforms ToGather.Asia and Crowdonomic.com launched in 2012 and 2013. Australia's Pozible will be setting up office here in December, said its co-founder, Alan Crabbe.\n\n\"Our focus is helping to build a strong creative industry in Asia, and we feel Singapore is fast becoming a creative capital,\" said Mr Crabbe. He cited the first ever-win at Cannes by a Singaporean, the country's art and writers festivals, and tech and creative projects as signs that Singapore's creative stature is rising.\n\nFor Crowdonomic.com, its launch was driven more by a problem at home.\n\n\"Early-stage capital formation is an extremely inefficient process in Singapore, and often businesses that get funded are those that have the best connections or luck, but not necessarily those that deserve funding the most,\" said founder-CEO Leo Shimada. \"Crowdfunding solves this problem by making access to capital a more efficient and merit-based process.\"\n\nIn short, it allows start-ups to experiment and test market demand, raise awareness, obtain feedback to improve or validate an idea, and acquire first followers and customers.\n\n\"While the spirit of giving - which is at the core of crowdfunding - has always been strong in Singapore, crowdfunding growth has been supported by the increasing sophistication of platforms and quality of campaigns,\" he said.\n\nJumping on the crowdfunding bandwagon next is new local start-up Clickdrive, which plans to raise funds for its \"next-generation open platform for smart driving apps\" on Indiegogo.\n\nSaid CEO Mark Sutheran: \"The advantages of crowdfunding vs seed funding for consumer products derive from pitching your dream directly to the customer rather than via individuals who only focus on ROI (return on investment). We like the idea that the final product will be shaped very much by the audience for whom it is intended.\"\n\nOn why he chose Indiegogo over a local platform, Mr Sutheran said the more established global platforms have a proven record of delivering \"six and seven-figure campaign numbers\".\n\nBut for PixBento's Mr Koh, it was Crowdonomic.com's service orientation that distinguished it from traditional platforms, which are usually more focused on campaign listings.\n\n\"Unlike the mainstream websites which are overcrowded, the guys behind Crowdonomic.com are proactive and always available for help. They regularly correspond with us on our progress and provide tips on how to run our campaigns more effectively,\" he said. \"They also invite campaigners to their events, which leads to more local exposure and eyeballs on our start-up.\"\n\nSimilarly, Pozible offers value-added services, such as custom feedback on campaigns, regular workshops and integration with multiple payment systems like Bitcoin. In fact, these help boost the Australian-based platform to one of the top three platforms globally, Mr Crabbe claimed.\n\nSo, is crowdfunding likely to replace venture capital in the near future?\n\nObservers disagree, and say both are complementary tools especially for early-stage start-ups.\n\nSaid Notiphi's Mr Mishra: \"VCs come with resources who are knowledgeable about their respective fields in which they invest, and keep up with new developments in a systematic manner. It's just not possible for crowds to be equally well informed.\"\n\n\"Crowdfunding for equity may impact traditional venture capital funding, but I don't think venture capital will be replaced,\" Mr Crabbe said. \"VCs will still provide access to networks, mentorship and experienced entrepreneurs.\"\n\n\"Venture capital rounds are getting larger and fewer, so for crowdfunding to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in funding - I doubt that would be possible,\" Mr Low said.\n\nBut he also said his firm has funded a few Kickstarter and Indiegogo campaigns, in a sign that a new breed of VCs has emerged. According to Entrepreneur Magazine, as the number of crowdfunding platforms continues to rise and competition for investor attention intensifies, more VCs now spend time poring through online platforms to identify promising companies.\n\n\"Start-ups could benefit most from a combination of crowdfunding, which brings the wisdom of the crowd, and top-tier VCs, who bring their wealth of business-building experience,\" said Mr Shimada.\n\nConcurring, Mr Koh said: \"Crowdfunding is a good alternative to initial seed money and to jump-start a production from ideation without losing equity. But it's mostly a one-time relationship. VCs are there for the longer mile. Not only do they invest and become part-owners of the business, they advise and provide networks to potential customers, buyers and subsequent fundings if necessary.\"\n\nA start-up cannot crowdfund for the long run, he added.\n\nUltimately, observers say there is growth potential for crowdfunding here, given its location at the centre of crowdfunding networks in Asia and the increased convenience in online spending.\n\n\"But the result will not be immediate. More education of the public on crowdfunding first needs to be in place,\" said Startup Jobs Asia's Mr Chew.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Even the FTSE ST China Index, which tracks the performance of around 30 stocks with businesses in China, is down five points month-on-month to 226 points. Mid-cap and small-cap indices were also down for the month.\n\nSaid a trader: \"We're still waiting for the next catalyst. Things are very quiet on my end. The PSLE examination is over, friends are taking the opportunity to get out of Singapore . . .\n\n\"Investors are looking elsewhere. Increasingly I'm looking at Malaysia and Hong Kong. There is no theme here. The only theme still going is business trusts and Reits (real estate investment trusts). But that's about it.\"\n\nAs of yesterday, the three stocks that added the most value over the month were blue chips DBS Bank and Keppel Corp, and hotel play Shangri-La Asia.\n\nDBS added $1.1 billion of market value (+2.6 per cent), Keppel added around $800 million (+4.2 per cent), and Shangri-La added around $600 million (+8.9 per cent). DBS, along with the other two local banks, outperformed in their third quarter results. Keppel Corp has benefited from contract wins. Shangri-La shares have been climbing up after a low in October.\n\nBut a sizeable amount of total market capitalisation was wiped out by other STI component stocks. The three stocks that lost the most market value over the month were Jardine Matheson (-6.1 per cent, -$2.8 billion), Jardine Strategic (-4.3 per cent, -$2 billion) and Thai Beverage (-11 per cent, -$1.5 billion).\n\nOther STI stocks that shed a few percentage points of value included StarHub, Hutchison Port Holdings Trust, CapitaLand, Global Logistic Properties, Hongkong Land, Jardine Cycle & Carriage and ST Engineering.\n\nAn outlier counter is C&G Environmental Protection Holdings, which develops and operates waste-to-energy plants in China. It doubled in value in the course of the month, adding $195 million of market capitalisation in the process. It had gone from 20 cents a share in October to 40 cents a share yesterday. Shanghai-listed Nanhai Development is proposing to acquire C&G's main Chinese waste-to-energy business and assets.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For example, both the Philippines and Thailand have regulations for Reits in place. India has also joined the fray, with market regulators expected to issue final guidelines on Reits early next year.\n\nReits tend to do best when located in the jurisdiction where their physical assets are found, given that investors will be more familiar with the assets. As other Reits jurisdictions develop, there will be less incentive for real estate players in these markets to leave home and come to Singapore to list.\n\nSingapore Reits venturing overseas may also have to compete against these Reits for assets. \"There will still be opportunities for Singapore Reits to acquire overseas assets, but they will always be competing against the local Reit market which may trade at a lower cost of capital because of investor familiarity,\" said Michael Smith, head of real estate investment banking in Asia ex-Japan at Goldman Sachs.\n\nThat said, the asset diversity of the Singapore Reits sector is seen helping it stay ahead despite the increasing competition. \"In Singapore, our Reits are buying everywhere, including Europe, US and Vietnam, and investors appreciate it. So I think for regional Reits, Singapore will continue to have the competitive edge,\" said Tan Kok Huan, managing director, asset-backed structured products, capital markets group, at DBS Bank.\n\nTaking Croesus Retail Trust (CRT) as an example, Mr Tan noted that while Japan has a larger Reit market than Singapore, CRT listed here because it has an Asia-Pacific mandate that was not confined to just Japanese assets. CRT's pipeline of assets with right of first refusal is all in China.\n\nThe regulatory regime in Singapore also remains attractive and does not impose any restrictions on ownership of foreign assets.\n\n\"Singapore is currently the only market where you can list purely offshore assets. If somebody wants to list purely offshore assets and that country doesn't have a Reit or BT market, Singapore is the natural choice,\" added Mr Tan.\n\nIt is for this reason that Fortune Reit, which holds a portfolio of retail malls and properties in Hong Kong, was able to successfully list on the Singapore Exchange in 2003, just two years after the first Reit in Singapore was successfully launched.\n\nIt helps that Singapore's tax regime does not impose further taxes once an entity has been taxed in a country with a headline tax rate of 15 per cent or more, he noted.\n\nFor that reason, Reits and business trusts holding purely foreign, or a mix of local and foreign, assets proliferate the Singapore market today. These include Ascendas Hospitality Trust with an Australia-based portfolio; Religare Health Trust which is entirely based in India; Mapletree Greater China Commercial Trust; and Croesus Retail Trust which has 100 per cent of its assets based in Japan.\n\nSingapore-based Reits are able to employ tax efficient structures to hold assets overseas, such as the Asset Backed Structure in Malaysia, or the Managed Investment Trust regime in Australia, said Jerry Koh, partner at Allen & Gledhill. Still, there are issues facing the Singapore Reits sector that may need addressing.\n\nThe top issue for most players is the sunset clause attached to the tax incentives here. For instance, the existing income tax, stamp duty, and GST concessions for listed Reits were renewed for an additional five years at Budget 2010, to March 31, 2015.\n\nIn addition, the Foreign-Sourced Income Exemption income tax, which previously did not have a sunset clause, was, as of 2010, subject to a sunset clause of five years till March 31, 2015.\n\nExtending this will provide certainty, particularly for investors, given that the incentive for individuals to receive distributions tax free is a powerful incentive, noted market watchers.\n\nIt might also be timely to relook the development limit imposed on Reits. Currently, Reits are only allowed to hold up to 10 per cent of their total assets in development.\n\nSing Tien Foo, associate professor at the department of real estate, National University of Singapore, pointed out that such a low development limit benefits larger Reits over smaller ones.\n\n\"If you look at Australia for example, there is no constraint on development, and the market sorts it out. Reits with a lot of development activities are seen to be more risky, and the market is efficient enough to differentiate this,\" he said.\n\nSingapore's small size is also a natural constraint. But this does not mean that there is no longer scope for local assets to be fed into Reits or business trusts.\n\n\"Because Singapore is a very finite island, of course some say there's limited 'Reitable' property, that's why they have to go overseas,\" said CapitaLand Singapore chief executive Wen Khai Meng.\n\n\"But I still think there are still a lot of opportunities because the population is still growing, the economy is expanding, and there's going to be a lot more shopping malls, hotels, offices, industrial buildings, business parks and logistics warehouses, etc. In addition, we have a lot of government buildings and HDB car parks which could well be put into a Reit.\"\n\nOn the business trust end, there are plenty of opportunities to list marquee assets, said DBS' Mr Tan.\n\n\"What would be great is listing our marquee assets with household brands. Asset classes like telecoms, train stations, power assets, ports and utilities give you very stable cash flow. Thailand has their skytrain, Hong Kong has their telecom (HKT Trust). Yes, there are still assets with household names and stable cash flow that can be injected into BT.\"\n\nLooking ahead, John Stinson, executive managing director for Asia-Pacific capital markets at Cushman and Wakefield, said that he expects seeing more listed Reits providing a vehicle for exposure to emerging markets and a range of foreign currencies, for example, a yuan fund.\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nPRODUCTION TEAM:Mindy Tan and Ong Chor Hao (BT Newsdesk), Eugene Teo (BTDigital), Yvonne Poh (BT Subs Desk), Khairie Rahmat (BT Art), Yen Meng Jiin (BT Photo)\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": [{"image_url": null, "alt_text": null}]}

They are focused on property development and property investment in China's Guizhou province.\n\n\"The switch was timely then as it allowed the group to evaluate and access the assets within the Trechance Group, cherry picking only the properties that are of better value and development potential,\" Mr In told BT.\n\nHe added that the acquisition of Trechance Holdings, completed on Oct 29, underpinned CSH's commitment to the China real estate market and its aspiration to become a regional real estate player.\n\nIn August, CSH said it was looking to raise up to $14.7 million in a rights issue, and had partnered global construction player China Gezhouba Group Corporation to further its plans to become a regional real estate player.\n\nCSH shares closed 25 per cent higher at half a cent yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Other detainees included church lay workers, social workers and professionals.\n\n\"Just weeks before the arrests, I had seen a production by the Third Stage,\" he recalls. \"The play was about the Social Development Unit, the organisation that's supposed to encourage Singaporeans to date and get married... The play was completely harmless, so I could not imagine how these people could be a threat to society.\"\n\nHe would also not have imagined then that he would one day take on the lead role in Square Moon, a new political play written by one of the former detainees, Wong Souk Yee.\n\nWong was a co-founder of the now-defunct Third Stage. She was detained in 1987 for over a year for being suspected of conspiring to overthrow the government. Square Moon is inspired by the 2008 escape of terrorist Mas Selamat as well as her own experiences being detained without trial.\n\nWong says: \"You could say that I write from a certain 'privilege' of having experienced something most people haven't. I have an insight into the psyche of detainees because I've been there myself.\"\n\nSquare Moon took a long and winding route to the stage. Written last year, it was supposed to have a private reading at the Substation but that was cancelled. The Substation said it had \"been advised on the content of the play\" and decided not to allow it.\n\nSquare Moon was also set to be staged at the M1 Fringe Festival earlier this year, but that too got canned. Wong subsequently submitted the script to the Media Development Authority (MDA) and was given the approval three months later to stage it.\n\nNow Square Moon is set to open at the University Cultural Centre on Dec 20 with director Peter Sau at the helm and a cast of familiar faces that include Neo Swee Lin, Zelda Tatiana Ng, Erwin Shah Ismail, Hemang Yadav and Koey Foo.\n\nWong says: \"I'm glad it's been given the green light by the MDA, but I won't stop worrying until I see it on stage.\"\n\nThe story centres on a government political opponent (played by Lim) who is arrested and detained without trial. He engages a lawyer (Ng) but she too is detained under suspicion of conspiring with him. As a new government sweeps into power, Lim is released but Ng remains in prison. More surprises ensue.\n\nDirector Sau, who was approached by Wong and fellow ex-detainee Chng Suan Tze to be involved, says all the cast and crew members have agreed to work for a small token fee since the play is not getting government funding. Sau says: \"I wanted to direct the play even though I'm not getting a full fee because I believe it's an important subject. Our younger generations should not be allowed to forget this chapter. In order for us to move forward, we must know our history better.\n\n\"I'm also doing it because I studied under the late playwright and director Kuo Pao Kun from 2001 to 2003. He too was detained without trial in 1976 under the Internal Security Act and he never spoke about it. He would want me to direct this.\"\n\nSquare Moon will be staged at University Cultural Centre Theatre, 50 Kent Ridge Crescent, National University of Singapore, on Dec 20, 8pm and Dec 21, 3 and 8pm.

The acquisition resulted in the group becoming the largest holder of Peruvian anchovy quota and a leading producer and exporter of fishmeal and fish oil in the world.\n\nRevenue was HK$8.7 billion, a 9.2 per cent decline from HK$9.58 billion in FY2012. This was attributed to the fall in revenue from the frozen fish SCM division as a result of the lower average selling price of products.\n\nGross profit fell 25.8 per cent from HK$1.89 billion to HK$1.4 billion, in line with lower revenue and higher fixed costs.\n\nChina Fishery, which is 70 per cent owned by Pacific Andes, also posted its full-year results ended Sept 28, 2013.\n\nIt reported a net profit of US$83.8 million, up 7.3 per cent from US$78.12 million last year.\n\nRevenue went down 8.1 per cent to US$555.01 million.\n\nRevenue slipped largely as a result of a significant reduction in total allowable catch in the 2012 second fishing season in the Peruvian anchovy fishery, as well as a drop in revenue from the contract supply business due mainly to lower average prices of various products.\n\nRevenue from China Fishery Fleet fell 44 per cent, from US$49.9 million to US$27.9 million, due primarily to the strategic decision of not operating the fishing fleet in the South Pacific Ocean.\n\nDespite this, the group's newly established fishing operations in Namibia contributed positively to the performance of CF Fleet, while Peruvian fishmeal operations benefited from higher average selling prices of fishmeal and fish oil.\n\nPacific Andes' earnings per share for the full year were HK16.18 cents, up from HK15.54 cents. China Fishery's earnings per share were 5.33 US cents, down from 6.55 US cents.\n\nPacific Andes declared a dividend of 0.30 Singapore cents per ordinary share, while China Fishery declared a dividend of one Singapore cent for FY2013.\n\nNg Joo Siang, executive director and chairman of the group, said: \"The group will focus on the realisation of synergies and cost savings from Copeinca in the year ahead. The Peruvian fishmeal operation is our engine for growth. The substantial improvement in total allowable catch for the current and upcoming fishing seasons certainly will add an extra boost to this engine.\"\n\nHe added that the group will also explore the possibility of increasing the value of the catch by promoting Peruvian anchovy for direct human consumption, as it presents a long-term value proposition for the overall growth of the group's business.\n\nThe group will also retain Copeinca's listing status on Oslo B\u00f8rs in this period when it is considering various strategic options for improving the group's organisational and capital structures.\n\nThe Pacific Andes counter was flat at 12.9 Singapore cents, while China Fishery's stock closed down 0.5 cent to 39.5 Singapore cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Jordanian flag carrier, which is pursuing the search for a partner and more aircraft purchases, has also had to absorb a drop in tourism from the Arab Spring uprisings in the region last year as well as workers' demands for higher salaries.\n\nMr Hadidi said a bond may be preferable over a sukuk because Jordan lacks experience with the Syariah-compliant securities. While the carrier didn't specify the duration of the bond, the security may pay a rate of about 5 per cent to 5.5 per cent as a five-year dollar bond, according to Amol Shitole, an India-based credit analyst at SJ Seymour Services Pvt. \"The implicit support from the Jordanian government would be the mainstay for this credit,\" Mr Shitole added.\n\nThe publicly traded company aims to quadruple capital from 84.4 million Jordanian dinars (S$149 million) in a private listing by the first quarter of next year, Mr Hadidi said. The carrier was listed on the Amman stock exchange in 2007, and the stock has locked in just one positive annual performance, in 2009.

If it's not going to be really, really successful, I don't think people are going to be falling over themselves to do that.\"\n\nLinc Energy said that it has seen keen interest from both local and offshore investors.\n\n\"We're gaining some very strong cornerstone investor interest in the region,\" its managing director Peter Bond told The Business Times in an interview.\n\nEarlier this week, the firm lodged its prospectus with the Monetary Authority of Singapore.\n\nIts change in listing venue comes as Australian interest in resources and mining stocks, which dominated listings on the ASX over the past few years, wanes.\n\nShares of companies in the energy and resources sector on the ASX, especially small caps, have been hurt by weak commodity markets.\n\nAt the same time, SGX has been actively courting listings in the sector in the past few years.\n\nIn September, it introduced new mainboard listing rules for mineral, oil and gas companies to allow those not yet in production but with market capitalisation of not less than US$300 million to list.\n\nLinc Energy had a market capitalisation of A$520.5 million (S$595.2 million) as at Nov 15 on the ASX, and recorded a loss of A$63.8 million in its 2013 financial year.\n\nThe firm produces oil in the US, and owns undeveloped coal and shale resources in Australia. It also possesses unique underground coal gasification technology.\n\nMr Bond said that Linc Energy had chosen to list on SGX because of the latter's ability to tap international capital, as well as the increasing orientation of the firm's business towards Asia.\n\nLinc Energy also intends to move its regional head office and trading operations here, and will have 10 people in its newly set up Singapore office by next month for a start. Its headquarters in Brisbane has a headcount of 120.\n\n\"It seems logical that as the division grew that we started to look at being traded in Singapore,\" said Mr Bond.\n\nAlthough the mineral and oil and gas sector on SGX is still a fledgling one, he sees a first-mover advantage. \"We saw an opportunity to be first movers into an emerging index that we'd like to be part of and help set the trend on, where there are a number of investors starved of opportunity,\" he said.\n\nThe other main exchange in the region, the Hong Kong Exchange, is too China-centric, he said, reflecting general sentiment in the market.\n\n\"There are a lot of big companies that listed in Hong Kong in the last two to three years that simply have not traded well,\" he added.\n\nSingapore has become the preferred location in the region for resource stock listings, said Petra Commodities' Mr Migliucci. \"There's no doubt that SGX is becoming one of the favourite locations for resource companies, especially for the ones that have an Asian focus. Where it may lack in industry understanding, SGX makes up in scarcity value.\"\n\nBut he cautioned that more needed to be done for the cluster to continue to grow on the exchange, such as developing a pool of credible research analysts who cover these stocks.\n\n\"It's not just listing. It's the after-market trading. What happens one week, one month or one year after IPO? If you don't get a proper credible research analyst supporting the IPO story, it runs the risk of becoming an orphan stock.\"\n\nMr Bond also had a suggestion for SGX: simplify the process of listing.\n\n\"My prospectus is the largest prospectus ever listed in Singapore (with) 1,500-1,600 pages,\" he said. \"The same prospectus in Australia would be 10 per cent of that size.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It was unclear if the remaining two bidders submitted final bids.\n\nSociete Generale's Asian private bank unit manages about US$13 billion, below the US$20 billion mark that the industry has come to see as necessary for critical mass in the region.\n\nEconomic growth has led to a surge in Asian millionaires and billionaires.

Chefs whipped up a variety of small bites. Dapper personnel distributed gift bags loaded with leather wallets and certificates marking the occasion.\n\nSingapore Airlines is reputed to treat its passengers regally, but not like this. Weeks after announcing that the Singapore-Newark, New Jersey, route that reigned as the globe's lengthiest non-stop flight would be \"retired\", the company was holding a retirement party for Flight SQ22 on Saturday before the final take-off.\n\nThe festive mood was tempered by an awareness among the travellers that the lone direct jaunt between the South-east Asian city and the New York area would end with the touchdown of the exclusively business-class jet nearly 10,000 miles and 19 hours after departure.\n\nFor Michael Smith of Merion Station, Philadelphia, this excursion on SQ22 would be his first and last. Returning from a month-long recruiting assignment in Asia for the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, where he is an associate director of admissions, Mr Smith agreed to serve as The New York Times' onboard eyes and ears. His written and oral account, which included interviews with fellow fliers, provided much of the material in this article.\n\nMr Smith's travel agent, while preparing the itinerary, had urged him to book SQ22 as the closing leg. \"You are really going to enjoy this experience,\" Mr Smith was assured.\n\nIt became apparent to Mr Smith before he sank into his beige window seat, 11K, and clicked shut his belt that the agent was prophetic. There was no rush to fill overhead storage bins. Attendants addressed him by name. The air was scented. \"Hot towels, reading materials and drinks appeared almost magically,\" he said, \"all of this before we even left the gate.\"\n\nMr Smith struck up a conversation with two SQ22 veterans, John Shettle and Joanne Lau. They assured him that accumulated stress dissipates because of the plane's calming ambience and valet-like service. Mr Shettle said he never witnessed even a hint of \"air rage\" from anyone on his numerous excursions.\n\nAmenities aside, regular passengers embraced the route in either direction for delivering them as rested as one can be from spending more than three-quarters of a day in a winging capsule. (It helps that each seat converts into a close facsimile of a bed.) Alternatives require switching planes, which can tack several hours and fatigue onto the trip.\n\nWhy is such a beloved route being retired?\n\nThe airline's explanation is that it is selling its small fleet of Airbus A340-500 aircraft, which also operated between Singapore and Los Angeles until last month.\n\nAviation analysts blame economic realities. A barrel of crude oil has tripled in cost since the inaugural voyage of SQ22 in mid-2004. (For four years, patrons could choose between business and coach class, which was still upscale enough to serve buffet meals.) \"Ultralong-haul flights like this are essentially flying jet fuel tankers,\" said Robert Mann, an industry consultant based in Port Washington, New York.\n\nFilling up the tank, which has a capacity he pegged at 57,000 gallons, is expensive. A prescribed minimum must be carried in case of a delayed landing or diversion to another airport, usually because of inclement weather, Mr Mann said. Less fuel is needed for international flights that involve a stopover for refuelling or a change of planes.\n\nFor Mr Smith, bound for home after completing his mission, the flight was all about comfort and frills. From a selection of a few hundred movies, he watched 42 and Pacific Rim, along with three episodes of Bob's Burgers cartoons. One meal, served with china and silverware on a starched tablecloth, featured salmon salad, another a Singaporean chicken rice dish, both from the menu. Mr Smith wondered what would have happened had he ordered an unlisted entree, as Mr Shettle once did to satisfy a sudden craving. The sausage and pancakes soon appeared on his tray.\n\nMr Smith did test the crew with a less challenging request. They came through with cookies, brought on a plate.\n\nThe least-expected luxury was discovered in the restroom, which was stocked with fresh-cut flowers. \"I looked around for a paper towel. No paper towel,\" he said, surprised to find a supply of absorbent cloth for drying hands.\n\nSome fliers on Saturday might have used the towels to dab tears of sadness. Adding to the dread of regulars is that the best choice left, at least on Singapore Airlines, is a flight with a stop in Frankfurt that arrives at John F Kennedy International Airport. Frequent flyer Tom Ward told Mr Smith that no sane business traveller wanted anything to do with JFK, while describing Newark Liberty International as easier to navigate.\n\nMr Shettle, who has long drawn amusement from acquaintances who mistakenly assume that such an extended stretch in the air is an ordeal, told Mr Smith that he was rarely eager to leave the plane upon landing.\n\nThe farewell flight for him and others, while awash in nostalgia, ended with no fanfare. A few goodbyes were exchanged and, after 19 hours of pampering, they returned to what Mr Shettle termed the \"real world\". Just outside Gate B6 at Changi, they can turn out the lights. The party is over. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

When things get crazily stretched, there are new emerging names out there to get in.\"\n\nWhile the Standard & Poor's 500 Index is poised for its biggest annual rally in 15 years, indicators from transportation stocks to the number of companies reaching 52-week highs to the rally's breadth are at levels that signalled further gains in the past. Even price-earnings ratios, up about 20 per cent this year, remain below valuations that preceded the end to previous bull markets.\n\nToo enthusiastic\n\nSince 2009, sceptics have said equities would decline, first because the credit crisis had killed the economy, and now because investors have become too enthusiastic for their own good. BlackRock Inc's Laurence Fink and Doug Kass at Seabreeze Partners Management Inc said this month that stocks were headed for losses after an almost uninterrupted rally that lifted the S&P 500 in one of its broadest advances on record.\n\nTo James Paulsen at Wells Capital Management Inc, the prospect of a tumble remains a long shot. \"Confidence is still barely average by historic standards,\" the Minneapolis-based chief investment strategist at Wells Capital, which oversees about US$340 billion, said in a phone interview.\n\n\"The market is up big because for a long time we priced the financial markets for the end of the world. And really, all that's happened so far is that we found out the world isn't going to end.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 climbed 0.4 per cent to 1,804.76 last week, extending the 2013 gain to 27 per cent, as the pace of hiring increased. The index surpassed 1,800 for the first time and is up 167 per cent since March 2009, as Federal Reserve chairman Ben S Bernanke held rates near zero and initiated three rounds of bond purchases to stimulate the economy. S&P 500 futures expiring next month climbed 0.3 per cent in London.\n\nRallies in shares of smaller companies, banks and transportation stocks have been bullish signs in the past. During the four biggest bull markets of the last quarter century, peaks in those categories have come before the S&P 500 reached its highest level almost 90 per cent of the time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The Russell 2000 Index of companies with an average market value of less than US$1 billion reached an all-time high of 1,124.92 on Nov 22. The S&P 500 Financials Index climbed last week to the highest point since September 2008. Indexes of transportation stocks and companies whose earnings are most dependent on economic growth reached records this month. \"Railroads in particular are quite sensitive to the economy, most of the smaller-cap companies have a more domestic business, and the smaller and regional banks tend to be more focused on lending to consumers and businesses,\" John Carey, a portfolio manager at Pioneer Investment Management who oversees about US$200 billion, said recently.\"As they prosper, the rest of the country will prosper.\"\n\nValuations in the S&P 500 climbed 20 per cent in 2013 as more than 440 stocks in the gauge advanced. Even with the expansion, the price-earnings ratio, at about 19, remains 19 per cent below the average level at which bull markets ended since 1982, according to data compiled by S&P and Bloomberg. The index traded at more than 30 times earnings when stocks plunged in 2000 and at 21 in 1987.\n\n\"It's still a buy-on-the-dips equity market,\" Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management, said in a phone interview from Minneapolis. He helps oversee US$112 billion. \"Inflation is contained, sentiment is still generally positive, and valuation is in that fair camp.\" Netflix Inc, Best Buy Co and Micron Technology Inc led the S&P 500 in 2013, climbing more than 200 per cent since January, data compiled by Bloomberg show. They're among more than 190 companies reaching 52-week highs this year.\n\nStock gains continue for another 22 months after a peak in the number of companies setting new highs, according to the average in the last three bull markets. In the last rally, 121 stocks traded at highs on Nov 3, 2003, the most for any day during that cycle, and the index rose 48 per cent through 2007. The S&P 500 climbed 33 per cent in the 13 months after 177 companies set records in June 1997.\n\n\"Rising markets attract attention and focus,\" said Paul Zemsky, the New York-based head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management, which oversees US$190 billion.\n\n\"People want to participate and be part of the crowd.\" Individual investors are just now coming back to the equity market, sending about US$27.1 billion to stock managers in 2013. The deposits would make this year the first since 2006 that equity funds have seen net inflows, after almost US$400 billion was withdrawn the previous four years, according to data compiled by the Washington-based Investment Companies Institute.\n\nRecord highs\n\nStocks have climbed after flows turned positive in the past, according to ICI data going back to 1984. Investors added US$6.8 billion to the funds in 1989 after taking out almost US$15 billion in 1988. The S&P 500 started its biggest bull market on record in 1990, as inflows doubled that year. Flows turned positive in 2003, when deposits totalled US$144 billion, and the S&P 500 kept climbing until October 2007.\n\n\"Retail investors are shifting into equities,\" Lawrence Creatura, a Rochester, New York-based fund manager at Federated Investors Inc, which oversees US$367 billion, said by phone. \"It certainly bolsters the chance for stocks to continue to rise. It is a source of demand for shares.\"\n\nThis year's 27 per cent advance has gone almost uninterrupted, leading Mr Fink and Mr Kass to question the sustainability of the rally. The 25 months since the S&P 500's last 10 per cent drop is the longest stretch without such a decline since 2007, according to S&P.\n\nGains have pushed the S&P 500 to a record 1,804.76 this year, more than 15 per cent above the high set in October 2007, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That's come even as profit growth slowed this year and economists cut growth projections.\n\n\"Traders and investors, strategists and pundits are now almost historically complacent,\" Mr Kass, the founder of Palm Beach, Florida-based Seabreeze, said in a Nov 12 Bloomberg Radio interview with Tom Keene and Michael McKee. \"They're glib.\"\n\nMr Kass has grown more bearish on the S&P 500 since he said a year ago that fears were overblown and called for the S&P 500 to rise to a record. \"I have more than one foot out the door and I'm looking for short opportunities,\" he said this month.\n\nStocks may decline as much as 15 per cent because of political risks in China, Japan, France and the US, according to Mr Fink, whose New York-based BlackRock is the world's largest money manager with US$4.1 trillion in assets. Last year Fink said he would invest all of his personal wealth in equities.\n\nThe steady surge isn't reason enough to worry about a correction, according to BMO Capital Markets. There have been 17 pullbacks of at least 5 per cent since the rally started 41/2 years ago, in line with the average 15 times for bull markets since 1970, according to data compiled by BMO.\n\n\"There's clearly a lot of suspicion and doubt in this bull market, and that in and of itself gives it further fuel,\" said Rich Weiss, the Mountain View, California-based senior portfolio manager for American Century Investment who helps oversee US$130 billion, said by phone Nov 21.\n\n\"Not everybody is in. The level of exuberance can clearly grow.\" While the rally has lasted about six months longer and produced bigger gains than the average bull market since World War II, the number of stocks climbing this year is bullish. History shows that widespread stock advances one year have led to an S&P 500 rally the next. In the six times when at least 400 stocks posted increases since 1980, the index returned an average 14 per cent in the following year, according to Strategas Research Partners. All of those ensuing years were positive.\n\nAnalysts project earnings will expand 10 per cent next year and 11 per cent in 2015, doubling the 2013 growth rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. At the same time, the pace of economic expansion will increase through September 2014.\n\nMr Hodges said he sold Yelp, which is unprofitable, and Pandora, which trades at 261 times estimated earnings, after their valuations got beyond his comfort level. Since September, he's invested in Gogo, based in Itasca, Illinois, and online video advertising company Tremor Video Inc. Analysts say both will lose money next year.\n\n\"There's many segments of the market that are very undervalued and have great potential from here,\" Mr Hodges said. \"Overall, I don't see excesses.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": []}

There's been a 55 per cent increase in the number of homes planned in the luxury market's lower end, mainly on the edges of neighbourhoods such as Mayfair and Knightsbridge.\n\nSouth Asian buyers account for two-thirds of new London homes sold before completion, according to Land Securities Group, the largest UK real estate investment trust. There's a risk that those investors will grow weary of repeated sales exhibitions promoting London property, Mark Farmer, head of residential at EC Harris, said in the report.\n\n\"Pre-sales are happening in a much more crowded market and there are increasing challenges for developers and investors which are resulting from this,\" Mr Farmer said.\n\n\"We are seeing a critical juncture in the market, especially at the lower end of the prime range, where it can no longer be a given that you should spend more to make more.\"\n\nLuxury home values in central London rose 6.8 per cent in October from a year earlier, the slowest in about four years, according to London-based broker Knight Frank.\n\nDevelopers now expect to construct London homes worth more than \u00a350 billion (S$101.3 billion) over the decade, EC Harris said. Oversupply is unlikely in the luxury market because construction rarely happens if companies don't achieve their pre-sales targets. However, profit margins may be squeezed by rising building costs, the firm said.\n\nEC Harris, based in London, defines luxury homes as those that will sell for \u00a31,250 a square foot or more. That's up from \u00a31,100 last year.\n\nWealthy prospective buyers may be deterred by talk of higher taxes, Mr Farmer wrote in the report. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne is considering a capital gains tax on the second homes of foreign owners of UK real estate, Sky News reported on Oct 31.\n\n\"This issue is fast becoming the biggest cloud gathering on the horizon of London prime residential,\" said Mr Farmer. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

The planning permission for a residential SoHo unit, for instance, gives it clearance to be used as a home. A separate application has to be made for it to be used as a home-office, and several restrictions apply on the kind of business that can be conducted there.\n\nThe liberal use of the \"SoHo\" label has drawn flak, given that such units tend to be marketed at a higher price, and buyers find out - too late - that they cannot be freely used as a home and an office.\n\nDonald Han, managing director at Chesterton Singapore, said: \"A lot of people bought shoebox units on the basis of the developer describing them in their brochures as SoHo. With more shoebox units headed for completion, there could be grouses on the ground when people realise that there is no such thing as SoHo use.\"\n\nThe URA has thus issued a circular to developers and their marketing agents, urging them to make it clear to prospective buyers upfront on the approved use of the development. \"Buyers should also find out the approved use of the development before committing to a purchase,\" said a URA spokeswoman.\n\nDevelopers who choose to continue marketing their projects under the \"SoHo\" banner will have to spell out the approved use of the unit in the sale-and-purchase agreement. With residential SoHo units, they must include a clause to specify that the unit is to be used primarily as a home, but that the purchaser can, if he wishes, apply for permission to use the unit as a home-office.\n\nLee Liat Yeang, a partner at Rodyk & Davidson Real Estate Practice Group, said: \"I think URA is concerned that when developers say your unit can be converted to a home office, agents may represent that it can be any kind of office.\"\n\nTerms and conditions apply under the Home Office Scheme. One of these is that the business should not hire more than two non-resident employees. Businesses not allowed in home-offices include maid agencies, beauty or massage services, commercial schools, sales or marketing businesses, courier services or businesses which cause disruption in the neighbourhood.\n\nMr Lee said: \"Potentially, you can apply for home office use for any residential property. Of course, the nearer you are to town, the more likely it is. But with town centres now split among Woodlands, Jurong, and Paya Lebar, I won't be surprised if people buy a residential unit there and apply to convert it into a home office.\"\n\nOn the commercial front, developers and marketing agents can no longer use the term \"SoHo\" to market office developments, given that offices are not allowed for residential use.\n\nMr Lee said this appears to be a clear statement from the URA to discourage developers from using the phrase \"SoHo\" to market office developments.\n\nThe circular issued yesterday came on the back of a string of both residential and commercial developments being marketed under the SoHo banner, such as Far East Organization's residential projects The Siena and The Cape and its commercial project PS100 in Peck Seah Street. All 100 strata office units at PS100 were snapped up over its launch weekend.\n\nThat Far East features so prominently in the SoHo space is unsurprising. The group introduced the SoHo concept to Singapore, and unveiled a dedicated Far East SO/HO brand in 2011.\n\nFar East's executive director of property services, Chng Kiong Huat, said the group supports the greater clarity on the use of \"SoHo\". None of Far East's commercial developments are currently being marketed for sale under the SO/HO brand, although future residential projects that align with the specific brand attributes will continue to be marketed as such.\n\nMr Chng said: \"We have made it a point to highlight to prospective homebuyers the approved use of the relevant units under the Planning Act. Specifically, we take care to highlight to purchasers of our SO/HO properties that they will need to comply with the requisite conditions set out by the relevant authorities should they intend to use their residential unit as a home-office.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He did not elaborate on the nature of the questionable conduct and did not indicate whether the firm was under any further investigation.\n\nAnother Navy official said that Inchcape was suspended for failing to report credible evidence of significant contract overpayments, committing an offence indicating \"a lack of business integrity or honesty\" and conduct so serious that it affected the firm's ability to be a government contractor.\n\nInchcape Shipping had contracts to help arrange repairs and other services when US Navy vessels made port visits overseas. Rear Admiral Kirby said that the suspension was part of an effort by Navy secretary Ray Mabus to ensure that contractors are \"fully compliant with contracting regulations and procedures\".\n\nThe suspension came in the midst of a corruption investigation into the business practices of Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia and its chief executive Leonard Glenn Francis, who was arrested in September and charged with bribing Navy officials to win business.\n\nSix Navy officers and a Navy investigator have faced action in connection with the probe, including two commanders and an investigator who were charged in the bribery conspiracy. Francis is accused of giving them luxury travel, tickets, prostitutes or cash for information helping him to secure government business.\n\nFrancis, a 49-year-old Malaysian businessman, was arrested in San Diego on Sept 16. A federal magistrate granted him US$1 million bail last week but stayed her ruling pending a review by another judge, leaving him in jail for the time being. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Foreign currency exposure is hedged, minimising currency risk.\n\nSaid Patrick Yeo, the fund's lead manager: \"Given the improving economic conditions in the US, we believe that investors are beginning to look ahead to a time when the US Federal Reserve will begin to normalise monetary policy.\"\n\nIndeed, US Treasury bonds have already started to factor in the prospect of higher interest rates, said Mr Yeo, who is also Fullerton's head of fixed income.\n\n\"Short-duration bonds are less vulnerable to rising interest rates, allowing investors to benefit from income payouts with measured risk,\" he said.\n\nThe fund invests in fixed-income securities, with average portfolio duration of up to three years and will be managed on a total return basis. It intends to distribute a quarterly dividend, income and/or capital gains permitting. On Oct 31, the fund's initial yield-to-maturity was 3.4 per cent.\n\nFullerton is targeting the fund to grow to at least US$1 billion in the medium term, given its evergreen features.\n\nIts flagship Fullerton Short Term Interest Rate Fund, which invests in short duration SGD bonds, is close to S$1.2 billion.\n\n\"The launch of this fund could not be timed better, in my view,\" said Kenneth Ho, Julius Baer managing director and Asia head of investment solutions group.\n\n\"As quantitative easing in the United States enters its final chapter amid a strengthening economy, investors should focus on short-duration instruments with credit risk.\n\n\"Higher up the issuer quality ladder, we also recommend adding short-dated investment-grade bonds to the mix. For investors seeking extra pick-up in a low-yield environment, short-dated investment-grade bonds offer attractive risk-return characteristics.\n\n\"And these issues are likely to outperform bonds from higher-quality issuers with longer duration as yields rise,\" said Mr Ho.\n\nJulius Baer is the second private bank that Fullerton has partnered to launch a new fund. The first was UBS, with whom it launched the Fullerton SGD Income Fund in January 2012.\n\nFullerton has a track record of managing short- duration fixed-income strategies. Its Fullerton Short Term Interest Rate Fund has delivered consistent top-quartile performance since inception.\n\nA unit of Temasek Holdings, Fullerton is an investment specialist, with expertise across all asset classes, including equities, fixed income, money market, currencies and alternatives. Its assets under management (AUM) total S$12 billion.\n\nPrior to its establishment in 2003, the fund management team operated as an in-house fund management division of Temasek Holdings.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The traditional route was setting up a holding company in tax havens such as Bermuda and the British Virgin Islands, and listing that holding vehicle here.\n\nAn unstated hope is also that market confidence in China companies, dubbed S-chips, will improve. The reputation of S-chips has been tarnished by a spate of accounting and corporate governance scandals in the past few years.\n\n\"The regulatory processes and due diligence conducted by the relevant regulatory organisations in both countries will provide greater assurance to the marketplace,\" said SGX's deputy chief regulatory officer Richard Teng.\n\nLawrence Wong, SGX head of listings, added that he continued to see interest from Chinese companies wanting to list in Singapore.\n\nTong Dao Chi, director-general of CSRC's department of international affairs, said the regulator would work to give Chinese domestic enterprises a better understanding of listing requirements and a more efficient procedure and platform to list on SGX.\n\nUnder the framework, potential issuers will first do a pre-consultation with SGX before submitting their proposal to CSRC. Upon CSRC's acknowledgement of the receipt of relevant documents, the China companies can apply to begin the SGX review process.\n\nThen, the companies will need to get CSRC's administrative licensing approval, before SGX decides on whether to grant it eligibility to list here. CSRC's review typically includes checks on whether the company paid the necessary taxes, or own the proper legal title to land assets. SGX and CSRC generally have consistent standards for accounting and corporate governance.\n\nOut of the 140 S-chips here, only four are China-incorporated, and it has been many years since the last listing. The four are China Merchants Property Development (listed on SGX in 1995), Tiangjin Zhongxin (listed in 1997), Junma Tyre (listed in 2004) and Fujian Zhenyun (listed in 2007).\n\nThe agreement between SGX and CSRC arose out of bilateral initiatives to cooperate on financial sector development and regulation, agreed upon at last month's Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation, the top bilateral body between Singapore and China.\n\nCSRC is the main regulator of China's securities industry. A year ago, it had blocked all IPOs from taking place in China due to fraud and market confidence issues. The IPO freeze resulted in a long pipeline of hundreds of companies.\n\nSome of those companies which have started on the CSRC process but are stuck waiting could now be drawn to Singapore, said Ernest Kan, chief of operations for clients and markets at Deloitte Singapore.\n\n\"The question is whether the company wants to go the extra mile and comply with international accounting standards to list here, or continue to wait,\" he said.\n\n\"Valuations in Singapore have improved in the past 12 months, and there is enough attraction to come here compared to Hong Kong.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Apart from Singapore, the other non-European in the Top 10 is the United States.\n\nBruno Lanvin, Insead's executive director for global indices, said at a press conference that it's pretty obvious the rich nations have the money to produce the talent.\n\nInsead also said in a press release that the top ranked nations have many things in common, including \"a long-standing commitment to quality education (United Kingdom, Switzerland, Finland and Sweden), history of immigration (United States and Australia) and a clear strategy to grow and attract the best and the brightest (Singapore)\".\n\nThe index measures a country's competitiveness based on \"the quality of talent it can produce, attract and retain\", said the press release.\n\nCountries are ranked according to their scores in six \"pillars\" - enablers, attract, grow, retain, labour and vocational skills and global knowledge skills populated by 48 variables.\n\n\"This allows a broad combination of data measuring how a country grows, attracts and retains talent, going from government policy and quality of education to sustainability or lifestyle, for example,\" the press release said.\n\nEnablers cover the regulatory, market and business landscape. Attract refers to external and internal openness. Grow reflects formal education, lifelong learning and access to growth opportunities.\n\nRetain points to sustainability and lifestyle, while labour and vocational skills encompass employable skills and labour productivity. Global knowledge indicates higher skills and competencies and \"talent impact\".\n\nSingapore ranks very highly on enablers (3rd).\n\n\"It is one of the easiest places in the world to do business with a strong and stable political setting,\" Insead said. \"It is able to attract foreign students and is strong in higher level skills and formal education.\"\n\nBut Singapore can do better in internal openness, access to growth opportunities and employable skills where it scores relatively low. Also, while it is placed runner-up in the overall index and the sub-index for input, it's at No 6 on the output sub-index. But Mr Lanvin said that being a relatively new nation, it takes time for Singapore's input to be translated into output.\n\nFirst-placed Switzerland tops both the input and output sub-indices. It excels in almost all the variables. The country's least convincing performance is in the attract pillar.\n\nThe Global Talent Competitiveness Index is expected to be published annually, at least for the next five years.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Meanwhile, the yen continued its downward slide against most major currencies yesterday in an accelerating trend which economists say will also tend to push up inflation as the cost of imported intermediate inputs leads to rises in the price of finished products.\n\nThe core-core index edged up 0.3 per cent in October while the core index (including energy prices) rose 0.9 per cent. Core prices have risen sharply but mainly because Japan is having to import more fuel in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and because the yen price of these has jumped.\n\nNeither the BOJ nor the government are ready to declare victory in the battle to turn 15 years of deflation into sustained inflation, and the BOJ is not yet within sight of its target of achieving a 2 per cent annual rise on (core) consumer prices.\n\nBut analysts are beginning to speculate that such a declaration may not be too far off.\n\n\"It may not be so long until the government declares an exit from deflation if consumer prices excluding foods and energy stay in positive territory stably,\" economist Masahiko Hashimoto at Daiwa Institute of Research in Tokyo was reported by Kyodo as saying yesterday.\n\nMinister of Economic and Fiscal Policy Akira Amari, meanwhile, said that \"as the effects of Abenomics further make progress, the move to start exiting from deflation has become clearer\".\n\nOne factor contributing to the rise in basic inflation in October was a rise in the price of household durables, where the price of intermediate inputs of parts and components from China and elsewhere is rising under the impact of a weakening yen.\n\nThe yen slid to a new six-month low of 102.52 to the US dollar in Tokyo yesterday and to 103.695 to the euro. Against the pound, it also traded lower at around 167.\n\nHousehold spending in Japan rose 0.9 per cent in October from a year earlier in inflation-adjusted terms, Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs said yesterday, despite upward trending prices.\n\nJapanese industrial output rose 0.5 per cent in October from the level in September while in November, manufacturing activity expanded at its fastest pace in more than seven years, according to government data.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The US move follows Japan Airlines Co's (JAL) decision to shift to other jets from 787s on some Asia routes.\n\nThe icing risk adds urgency for pilots to steer clear of thunderstorms already shunned because of potentially deadly lightning and turbulence. Jets flying at high altitudes through tropical zones can be at risk from powerful storms that promote the formation of performance-sapping ice, according to GE, the world's largest maker of jet engines.\n\n\"It's a relatively rare phenomenon because it requires just the right meteorological conditions,\" Hans Weber, president of San Diego-based aviation consultant Tecop International Inc, said. \"This isn't a problem that will be limited to GE engines. These crystals have been found in all engines at high altitudes near thunderstorms.\"\n\nThe twin-engine Dreamliner, the first jet made chiefly of composite materials, entered service with ANA Holdings Inc's All Nippon Airways in October 2011. Tokyo-based ANA, the biggest Dreamliner operator, uses Rolls-Royce Holdings plc engines on its planes.\n\nJAL's 787s have GEnx engines, as do the Dreamliners flown by United Continental Holdings Inc, the only US airline flying 787s.\n\nChicago-based United hasn't changed schedules or routes for its Dreamliners, said Christen David, a spokeswoman.\n\nAtlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc, the lone US operator of 747-8s, adjusted operations after Boeing's Nov 23 warning for GEnx-equipped jets to stay 90km from storms, said Bonnie Rodney, a spokeswoman.\n\nAny disruptions for the freighters from the Purchase, New York-based company \"will be minimal and can be managed with only minor reroutings\", she said on Monday.\n\n\"This looks a lot like a classic teething issue,\" Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Fairfax, Virginia-based consultant Teal Group, said. \"It's probably isolated to just the engine, and even then just one of the two engines available as options. It's also probably easily fixed with a software tweak, rather than any kind of hardware modification.\"\n\nGE said it's making software modifications to eliminate the ice-buildup risk and expects them to be available in the first quarter.\n\nMarc Birtel, a spokesman for Chicago-based Boeing, said the engines' design and maintenance practices, together with the new instructions, allow for the jets' \"continued safe operation\".\n\n\"The FAA has been working closely with Boeing and GE to monitor and understand these events as the companies develop a permanent solution,\" the FAA said in a statement.\n\nBoth the 787 and 747-8 have had bumpy debuts. The 747-8 was two years late in starting service in 2011, and slack demand forced Boeing to cut output.\n\nThe Dreamliner, whose 2011 entry was 31/2 years late, had been grounded for three months in January after meltdowns in the lithium-ion battery packs on two planes.\n\nThere have been six cases since April of planes with GEnx engines temporarily losing thrust in high-altitude icing conditions, Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE said on Nov 23.

The Tokyo-based carrier will make a decision this week on flights past Dec 1, said Jian Yang, a spokesman.\n\nBoeing surpassed 1,000 orders for the Dreamliner with its haul at the Dubai Airshow this month.

Indeed, Malaysian companies were the largest group of property investors in London last year, pumping RM6.34 billion (S$2.45 billion) into the sector and snapping up mainly office buildings in the British capital.\n\nThe single-largest investment there is the iconic Battersea Power Station. Last year, SP Setia, one of the largest property developers in Malaysia, beat off a clutch of international developers to win the development rights to the station, paying \u00a3400 million for the privilege.\n\nSP Setia, owned by state trust Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB), later roped in Sime Darby, also ultimately owned by PNB, and the EPF, the country's largest private pension plan, to defray the costs of the development.\n\nThe mainly Malaysian-funded syndicated loan is led by CIMB as the coordinating mandated lead arranger and book runner, but Singapore's OCBC Bank, Standard Chartered and Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) have also been named as joint mandated arrangers.\n\nBPHC chairman Liew Kee Sin, who is also the chief executive of SP Setia, said: \"We are delighted that our bankers, who have worked with us for many years in Malaysia, have come out so strongly to support our efforts to revitalise the Battersea Power Station.\"\n\nBernama reported that he was speaking at a loan-signing ceremony witnessed by the Minister of Urban Wellbeing, Housing and Local Government Abdul Rahman Dahlan.\n\nThe financing is the largest real-estate loan extended this year and includes a five-year development facility to support Phase 1 of the development and the refurbishment of the Battersea project over the next 31/2 years.\n\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg reported that the developer plans to sell the luxury apartments for as much as \u00a330 million each, anticipating that buyers would pay a premium to own prominent pieces of the historic building.\n\nMr Liew said in Kuala Lumpur yesterday that BPHC would start selling 250 apartments at \u00a32,500 per square foot in April. The estimated price of a penthouse in the derelict power station, to be built in the second phase of construction, is \u00a325 million to \u00a330 million, the company said.\n\n\"This is the only apartment in the UK, and perhaps Europe, that's being built on top of a power station,\" Mr Liew told reporters. \"There are people who want to own a piece of the history.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Until that inventory starts selling off, new aircraft sale will not rebound,\" Mr McGeough told Reuters in an interview.\n\nFive years on from a credit crunch that badly hurt the industry, manufacturers of small business jets are only now speaking of shoots of recovery, lagging well behind a rebound in the global equity and US housing markets.\n\nPlentiful secondhand jets are crimping demand for new light and medium-sized aircraft, in stark contrast to top-end products on display in Dubai, according to experts.\n\n\"It's a customer's market and buyers are smart,\" Marco Tulio Pellegrini, chief operating officer for business aviation at Brazilian business jet manufacturer Embraer, said. \"Many are looking at the used market for replacement, forcing manufacturers to increase discounts,\" he added.\n\nRe-manufacturing is the process of bringing end-of-life goods back to their original condition and is responsible for a growing share of the manufacturing sector.\n\nStarting out from the familiar tyre retread, the process can cover anything from refrigerators to ink cartridges, medical pumps, gearboxes, office furniture - even locomotives.\n\nAccording to a 2012 US trade report, aerospace is the largest re-manufacturing sector worth US$13 billion annually. But until now, this has mainly been confined to aircraft parts.\n\nHowever, while large business jets are benefiting from new technology, some analysts say re-manufacturing merely underscores industry woes at the lower end of the market.\n\n\"It's a sign of a stagnant market . . . (with) not a lot of technology coming in,\" said aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia, vice-president of Teal Group. \"The idea is sound in that most of the progress in business jets, especially lower end business jets, has been in propulsion and avionics.\"\n\nNextant has sold 36 of its re-manufactured business jets. After a spell in jet rehab, they sell for US$4.95 million. Canadian Bombardier's smallest aircraft start off at US$8.1 million and Gulfstream's at US$15.7 million.\n\nSuppliers see demand for low-cost business jets even in the oil-rich Middle East, in the wake of corporate budget cuts and the shrunken wealth of high net worth individuals. \"The light and mid-sized segment was impacted the most, while the larger cabins weathered the downturn well,\" said Scott Neal, senior vice-president of sales at Gulfstream.\n\nNine months after seeking bankruptcy court protection from high debts, the manufacturer of Nextant's revamped planes, Beechcraft Corp, emerged from Chapter 11 this year minus the \"Hawker\" name.\n\nIt stopped producing the Japanese-designed airframes being retrofitted by Nextant several years ago. But earlier this year, the manufacturer launched its own upgrade programme for the Hawker 400 jet, called the 400XPR.\n\n\"We've had three solid quarters this year - we're bullish about the future and the Middle East,\" said Richard Emery, president for Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia-Pacific at Beechcraft.\n\nBusiness jet makers could make a total of 9,800 deliveries worth US$269 billion in the next decade, according to Bombardier. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 29, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nDreamweave & Other Stories\n\nMillenia Walk, #01-34\n\nTel 6333 1669\n\nOpening hours: 10:30am to 9:30pm daily\n\nCOLIN Banning says \"life is full of happy coincidences\", when describing how his store came about. His wife, Jenny Looi, first chanced upon Sika-Design's rattan and outdoor furniture at a trade fair in Europe, and was impressed by the Danish brand's design and quality.\n\n\"Jenny saw a business opportunity to bring it to Singapore, and as luck would have it, the owner of the business and his daughter, Knud and Louise Andreasen, were also at the fair,\" Mr Banning recalls. The conversation that started then led to the Andreasens coming to Singapore on their next trip to Asia, where Mr Banning met them and sealed an agreement with them to be their exclusive distributor.\n\nLast month, he opened Dreamweave & Other Stories in Millenia Walk. Apart from Sika-Design, he is also the exclusive distributor for Tine K Home, another Danish homeware brand, and Campomaggi, an Italian brand for leather bags. The store also sells a small collection of Herskind bicycles from the UK and Louise Kragh jewellery from Denmark.\n\n\"We didn't plan to specialise in Danish design,\" says Mr Banning, who used to head the finance department at food manufacturing company Mars. Ms Looi is the managing director for Villeroy & Boch Asia Pacific.\n\n\"Sika-Design was the first. Tine K Home was a clear second choice as they already had a strong collaboration with Sika-Design and their designs complement each other well,\" says Mr Banning. The couple selected the other brands based on their quality and design. \"If we feel they have the potential to delight, we bring them in.\"\n\nSika-Design is a family-run business founded by Ankjaer Andreasen in 1940 that produced wicker and straw baskets, before expanding into rattan furniture. Today, the firm is run by Ms Andreasen, the third generation owner. Sika-Design is the largest Danish rattan furniture manufacturer and has its factory in Indonesia.\n\nThe brand prides itself on its timeless designs in the form of handcrafted rockers and armchairs. Some of the pieces in its Icon collection were designed in the 1940s, but would still fit in well in a modern home today. Bestselling pieces here include the Monet chair and footstool, Monet rocker, and the Affaire semi outdoor collection. \"The Icons collection is also a hit with architects and designers,\" says Mr Banning. The Monet rocker costs $980.\n\nFor Tine K Home, its down inner cushions, which start from $20 without cushion covers, are also popular for their comfort and they retain their shape well. Founded by Tine Kjeldsen, the collection is inspired by passion for beautiful objects and different cultures. Apart from cushions, there are also lamps, glassware, silverware, ceramics and carpets, available at Dreamweave.\n\n\"While we have no direct experience in furniture retailing, we have been avid furniture customers and know the industry landscape well,\" says Mr Banning. \"We base our selections on proven bestsellers within the collections, as well on our local knowledge of consumer tastes and preferences. We learn every day what appeals most to our customers, and interestingly, the popular products in Europe are selling well in Singapore.\"\n\nThe French connection\n\nRoche Bobois\n\n354 Alexandra Road, The Alexis, #01-19/20/21\n\nTel 6734 7939\n\nOpening hours: 11am to 8pm, Mon to Thurs, and Sun; 10am to 9pm, Fri, Sat\n\nMOVE over, Ikea. When it comes to shopping for furniture, the Swedish store is not the only option on Alexandra Road. French luxury furniture brand, Roche Bobois, is also muscling in on the action with a newly opened showroom on the same stretch. The brand, started in 1960, is best known for its cutting edge designs - think dining tables with sculpted legs.\n\nThe 7,500 square foot showroom carries two collections - Les Contemporains and Nouveaux Classiques. Like their fashion counterparts, both collections have new pieces that are introduced twice a year. Les Contemporains is the contemporary collection, and Roche Bobois works with designers such as Hans Hopfer, Pierre Paulin and Ora Ito.\n\nSome of its iconic pieces include the Mah Jong sofa that was first introduced in 1971. Designed by Hans Hopfer, the sofa comes in modular pieces and can be an armchair, sofa, lounge chair or a bed, depending on how the pieces are arranged. Brand conscious homeowners can have the sofa cladded in fabric from fashion houses such as Kenzo, Missoni, Ungaro, Jean Paul Gaultier and Sonia Rykiel.\n\nAnother popular item in the Les Contemporains collection is the Moonlight coffee table, which is sculpted from a single stainless steel \"thread\". Each piece is hand crafted in Europe. On the other end of the spectrum is the Nouveaux Classiques collection, where the pieces are inspired by France's long and illustrious heritage of artisan cabinet-making and also by neo-industrial trends. Think side consoles with scallop trimmings on them, or bookshelves with gilded handles.\n\nShopping for furniture here is not as simple as merely picking a piece. The brand prides itself on being able to customise its pieces, but the headache is in deciding which of its 100 colours in fabric or leather to pick. Not only that, the cushions come in a mix of feathers and multi-density foam, so you can decide how firm or soft you want your sofas to be.\n\nWithin the Nouveaux Classiques collection, the options are just as mind-boggling. Want a piece that looks more distressed? No problem. Don't like bronze? Then how about handles in gold, brass or silver? Roche Bobois declined to reveal prices for its products, since prices vary depending on choice of materials and finishings.\n\n\"You and your friend could have bought the same sofa or cabinet, but by opting for different colours, materials and finishes, no one can tell they are both the same piece,\" says Huma Qureshi, its public relations director.\n\nApart from selling furniture and home accessories, Roche Bobois also offers complimentary interior consulting services. Customers only need to bring a floor plan of their home, through a 3D rendering software, Roche Bobois' designers can create a 3D layout and image of the space using the brand's furniture pieces.\n\n\"We know how difficult it can be to imagine how a place will look, so this service takes away the guesswork,\" says Ms Qureshi.\n\nUpdated history\n\nMoreLess\n\n302 Jalan Besar Level 1\n\nTel 6294 0042\n\nOpening hours: 11am to 8pm daily\n\nMENTION Chinese furniture and images of rosewood furniture with pearl inlays come to mind. Which is fine if you're into antiques, but younger homeowners may be less than enthused about them.\n\nEnter MoreLess, a Chinese furniture brand created by furniture designer Hou Zheng Guang in 2009. The designs are distinctively Chinese but with a touch of modernity for an updated look.\n\nUnlike traditional Chinese furniture, which is mostly made of hardwoods such as rosewood and zitan, the pieces at MoreLess are made from walnut - sourced from a renewable forest in North America - which gives the furniture a softer and more contemporary feel. Walnut was also chosen for its natural light brown patina and for its grain.\n\nHaving been in the market for less than five years, Mr Hou says that \"creation is too early for us now, our mission is extending tradition\". This explains why some pieces from the collection are inspired by traditional items.\n\nFor example, the Benchmonk shelves ($5,200), are inspired by olden day benches. The shelves are stackable, but what makes them more unusual is that each shelf has legs of different lengths. But when placed on top of each other, the separate pieces work together to form a conversation piece.\n\nAlso eye-catching is a standing mirror, where the walnut frame is shaped like a vase. The mirror lives up to its name, Ping, which is Chinese for vase. Another popular choice is the Peach Tree hanger, a coat hanger so called because of how it looks.\n\nA more unusual piece in the collection is the Buddha Palm sofa, a modular sofa that resembles an upturned hand.\n\nMoreLess prides itself on creating pieces where \"form should be accurate, function should be complete, costs should be reasonable, and quality should be fine\", says Mr Hou.\n\nApart from Singapore, there are also MoreLess stores in Shanghai and Beijing.\n\nJoanna Lim, marketing manager for Luxur Home, which brought in MoreLess to Singapore, says that \"MoreLess appeals to those who love wooden furniture and have a keen interest in Chinese history\".\n\nMoreLess prides itself on creating pieces where 'form should be accurate, function should be complete, costs should be reasonable, and quality should be fine', says Mr Hou.\n\nDistinctively Scandinavian\n\nMatzForm\n\n302 Jalan Besar Level 2\n\nTel 6294 0042\n\nOpening hours: 11am to 8pm daily\n\nWITH its clean lines, designs that are aesthetically pleasing with minimal fuss, while still fulfilling their function, Scandinavian design has always struck a chord with Singapore homeowners.\n\nThat explains the proliferation of furniture stores that fly the Nordic design flag, but it looks like there's always room for one more.\n\nMatzForm was founded by Soren Matz, who trained as a cabinet-maker in his native Denmark. He later spent 20 years in Japan refining his craft, before relocating himself and his business to Shanghai.\n\nWhile the furniture is made in Shanghai, the design is distinctively mid-century Scandinavian. MatzForm works with well-known designers such as Marc Newson and Thomas Juul-Hansen on the collection which includes chairs, dining and living room sets. These are found in the brand's Twist Collection, which is young and with a more quirky take. Take the Twist sofa, which from afar, resembles two intertwined giant worms.\n\nMatzForm also has a Classic collection for more staid tastes. They're considered classics of Scandinavian design, which MatzForm has the licence to reproduce.\n\nSome of these classics include the Fireplace chair, $3,600 by Danish couple Trove and Edvard Kindt-Larsen, as well as the Panton Relaxer One Chair, $2,350. Designed by Verner Panton in 1974, this floor rocker consists of two bent wooden runners which are connected by slats. Due to the relatively small numbers produced then, the Panton Relaxer chair has turned into a highly collectible object for vintage design aficionados and collectors.\n\nApart from the Classic and Twist collections, MatzForm's third collection is made entirely from bamboo composites, which retain the natural strength and ecological benefits of traditional bamboo. The bamboo range has dining and armchairs, study desks and stools.\n\nMatzForm works with three manufacturing partners in Shanghai. Having spent the last seven years building up a relationship with them, Mr Matz confidently says that he has been able to \"develop our suppliers' quality to match the level of Danish craftsmanship\". Should some furniture pieces require fittings or components that MatzForm cannot source from China in suitable quality, it imports them from Denmark.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But sky-high property prices in cities have driven many urban dwellers to buy such low-cost homes.\n\n\"A buying frenzy has occurred in some places amid hopes that such 'small-property-rights housing' could be legalised,\" the newspaper said.\n\nChina's home prices have continued to set new records even after a four-year long official campaign to cool the market. The government is concerned that runaway prices could foment social unrest.\n\nThe paper quoted Xu Deming, a vice-land minister, as saying that the party plenum's decision to allow some rural land to enter a unified urban-rural land market was \"on the premise of conforming to the planning and is under usage supervision\".\n\nIn China, land in urban areas is owned by the state and can be freely traded. Land in rural areas is owned by collectives - villages and townships - and contracted out to farmers.\n\nRural land can only be used for property or industrial development after being requisitioned by the state. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

By May Yip\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 29, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWITH a booth promoting plush furs in the foyer, and interviews with upscale designers on their exotic-skin accessories and jewel-encrusted trinkets, the idea of fashion with a conscience seemed to be the last thing on the minds of participants at the recent SEA Of Luxury Conference. But closing the three-day International New York Times conference, an annual event with its latest instalment held here, was a session on socially-responsible luxury. And Stephen Dunbar-Johnson, president, international, The New York Times Company, said: \"My pledge is to continue to make sustainability one of the core aspects of the conference.\"\n\nThe luxury industry has been gradually waking up to ethical and environmental responsibilities, even as reputation-tainting scandals of sweatshop facilities continue to make headlines and major brands are put under the spotlight for their non-existent environmental policies.\n\nIndeed, when Livia Firth, creative director of sustainability consultancy Eco Age and founder of the Green Carpet Challenge, which pairs celebs with ethical designer ensembles for the red carpet, was asked if luxury would ever be conscionable, she said: \"I truly believe so! A lesson that many fashion pioneers have taught me is that sometimes fashion industry orthodoxy should and can be turned on its head.\"\n\nThe activist and wife of actor Colin Firth was in town to talk about her involvement with Chopard's first ethical high jewellery collection, using Fairmined-certified gold and diamonds with their origins certified by the Responsible Jewellery Council, a surveillance body on responsible sourcing and supply chain due diligence. The lacework-inspired pieces were first unveiled at a film premiere during this year's Cannes Film Festival, worn by actress Marion Cotillard.\n\n\"In Cannes, the first people to purchase the collection were Korean private clients, who bought it because of the story,\" said Mrs Firth.\n\nRather than being a one-off ethical range, Chopard will eventually extend the use of Fairmined gold to 100 per cent of its merchandise, according to Maxime Labey, its international retail director. This initiative is supported by the Alliance for Responsible Mining (ARM), a group that focuses on fair trade standards for small-scale and artisanal miners. The gold used by Chopard's ethical Green Carpet Challenge pieces originates from community mines in South America, and is then refined in a foundry specialising in fair trade raw materials.\n\n\"Two years ago, Livia asked Caroline (Scheufele, co-president and artistic director of Chopard), 'where does your gold come from?' and Caroline said, 'the Swiss bank? I don't know,\" said Mr Labey, who was also present at the conference, held at Capella Singapore. \"Almost all luxury jewellery brands buy gold from banks and it comes from different sources, nobody really knows where the gold exactly originates.\"\n\nWhile Mr Labey conceded that \"right now, I don't think most of our clients care (about the ethical production of jewellery\", he added that the family-run business is passionate about the cause, and will proceed with the use of Fairmined gold despite higher production costs because Chopard \"does not have shareholders to answer to\".\n\nBesides baubles, Mrs Firth has been working alongside top fashion labels, launching a partnership with Gucci to produce the world's first luxury handbag collection made from zero-deforestation, certified Amazonian leather earlier this year.\n\n\"This was the culmination of two years' of hard work transforming Gucci's supply chain to procure sustainably produced leather from the Brazilian Amazon, which was sourced from Rainforest Certified cattle ranches,\" added Mrs Firth. \"Rare materials, such as python skin, crocodile and fur are subject to a lot of research at the moment - wild versus farmed, skinning techniques, and so on.\"\n\nIn fact, Kering, the owner of Gucci and other high fashion labels like Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta, has recently set seemingly un-glamorous yet pragmatic targets applying to raw materials sourcing; paper and packaging; water use, waste and carbon emissions; hazardous chemicals; and evaluating its key suppliers to adhere to its code of conduct.\n\n\"Even if a customer does not ask a direct question about sustainability in the shop, we can play a major role in changing attitudes by educating suppliers about the use of water, handling of waste and biodiversity,\" said Marie-Claire Daveu, chief sustainability officer and head of international institutional affairs at Kering, who was formerly a senior civil servant for France's Ministry of Ecology and Sustainable Development.\n\n\"We are not promoting sustainability just for communications with our clients but we do it to ensure that the business can be continued.\"\n\nDuring the conference, Ms Daveu also announced the group's Python Conservation Partnership, which, among other initiatives, monitors the capture of wild pythons, standards of animal welfare and captive breeding . The programme is in collaboration with non-governmental organisations, the International Trade Centre (ITC) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN SSC Boa & Python Specialist Group), and it is hoped to \"positively impact the conservation of the two biggest python species of South-east Asia which are affected by the python skin trade - the Burmese and the Reticulated Python,\" said Tomas Waller, chair, IUCN SSC Boa & Python Specialist Group.\n\nBesides the sustainable sourcing of the precious skins, carrying that all-leather tote just became less of a guilty pleasure, as Gucci now uses an organic tanning agent such that the leather and wastewater from the tanneries are free of heavy metals, which are part of the toxic waste that affects the inhabitants of neighbouring areas.\n\nFor those hoping to shun the use of animal skin completely, there is also the leather-free products by life-long vegetarian, Stella McCartney.\n\n\"It seems to me that fashion is the last industry on the planet to address ethics,\" candidly admitted the designer, who does not use any leather or fur in her designs. \"That's something I hate about my industry. Sometimes you get the idea that all these designers are up on their high horses looking down on mere mortals, saying, 'Who cares, it's fur, it's beautiful, darling!' Those people are out of touch.\"\n\nOne of the top performing labels for the Kering group, Stella McCartney also does not carry out animal testing for products such as its fragrances, and has launched organic and eco product lines over the years.\n\n\"Anything - this subject of sustainability or any in general - is in danger of becoming a trend or a one-off,\" said the Central Saint Martins graduate in an e-mail interview, known for her ability to balance femininity and functionality in her sharply-finessed styles. \"The important thing is that everyone keeps an interest in it, and there is a vested interest because we live on this planet and we need to look after it. It's not just the fashion industry, it's every single industry.\"\n\nFor Mrs Firth, the glamour of Hollywood melded with the aspirational cachet of fashion is the perfect platform for highlighting good causes.\n\n\"When Colin received the nomination for the Golden Globes in 2009 for Tom Ford's stunning movie 'A Single Man', I suddenly found myself having to accompany him on all the biggest red carpets worldwide,\" said the Italian-born mother of two. \"This was the perfect opportunity to combine what I did as a day job with Eco Age with highlighting the issues I care about: environmental impact and social justice in the fashion industry.\"\n\nThe United Nations Leader of Change recently launched a capsule Green Carpet Challenge (GCC) collection with online retailer Net-A-Porter, featuring 10 gowns from five British designers, Erdem, Burberry, Victoria Beckham, Christopher Kane and Roland Mouret, and 20 per cent of proceeds going to the (Red) Global Fund to fight Aids and HIV in Africa.\n\n\"If I ever felt cynical, I would never do anything,\" said Mrs Firth, when quizzed about the effects of the one-off GCC designs by major brands. \"You can't underestimate the effect of planting little seeds around. Even if you work with one designer only on a one-off project, you are still introducing new fabrics, new concepts, helping them join some dots they wouldn't necessarily think about and before you know it, you have changed them for ever.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/rise-inflation-seen-continuing-2014", "site_title": "Rise in inflation seen continuing into 2014", "publish_date": null, "content": "Rise in inflation seen continuing into 2014\n\nOctober CPI up at 2%; higher wages likely to be passed on to consumers next year\n\nPublished\n\nMon, Nov 25, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] Singapore's inflation is on a zig-zag path, creeping back to 2 per cent in October due to higher food and car prices, even though rebates for households contained the price increase. But economists believe the upward trajectory of prices will continue into 2014, as higher wages are passed on to consumers.\n\nThe bounce back in October inflation data - up from September's surprise easing to 1.6 per cent - was partly due to a pick-up in certificate of entitlement (COE) premiums, which the government expects to remain volatile in the short term as the market adjusts to the pending re-categorisation of COEs.\n\nEconomists polled by Bloomberg had been expecting a marginally higher 2.1 per cent rise in CPI in October from a year ago.\n\nIn their joint statement yesterday, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said private road transport costs rose by 2.7 per cent after declining by 2 per cent in the previous month. In September, a correction in car prices occurred due to high base effects.\n\nBut beyond car prices, October's CPI increase was also a result of food inflation, which stood at 2.5 per cent last month compared to 2.4 per cent in September.\n\nWhile part of this was due to slightly steeper price increases in non-cooked food, more expensive prepared meals at restaurants and hawker centres also nudged food inflation higher.\n\nIndeed, MAS core inflation inched up to 1.8 per cent from 1.7 per cent in September, due to stronger contributions from food and oil-related items.\n\nThe MAS core inflation measure excludes private road transport costs and accommodation costs. The rise in the latter mellowed to 1.9 per cent in October from 3.9 per cent the previous month, thanks to this year's final disbursement of Service & Conservancy Charges (S&CC) rebates for HDB households.\n\nUOB economist Francis Tan told BT: \"There were rebates this time which brought accommodation costs down - otherwise we would've seen a higher (inflation number). There's no rebate in November, so inflation should edge higher going forward.\"\n\nIndeed, the MAS and MTI yesterday cautioned that headline inflation could \"rise further\" in November, \"as the effect of the October S&CC rebates dissipates and COE premiums increased in October\".\n\n\"MAS core inflation is expected to be higher in November 2013, partly on account of a low base a year ago,\" they added.\n\nWhile headline inflation is projected to come in at 2.5-3 per cent in 2013 and 2-3 per cent in 2014, the government expects core inflation to rise over the next few quarters, and average 1.5-2 per cent in 2013 and 2-3 per cent in 2014.\n\nSaid ANZ economist Daniel Wilson: \"Rising restaurant prices may be an early sign that this pass-through to core (inflation) is intensifying.\"\n\nAdded Mr Tan: \"The risk of inflation pick-up rests on domestic costs such as wages and rentals. Particularly for wages, the impending increase in the qualifying salaries for employment passes (January 2014) and another round of foreign worker levy increase (July 2014) will add on to the wage-bidding war in the currently tight labour market. Labour costs of the service industry will be impacted more as they tend to have higher labour input content.\"\n\nHowever, OCBC economist Selena Ling believes that such pass-through effects \"have been less than expected\", highlighting how services inflation eased to 2.5 per cent in October from 2.7 per cent in the preceding month, led by slower increases in the costs of recreation & entertainment and holiday travel.\n\n\"The government keeps warning about core inflation going up, but actually, we haven't really seen that acceleration effect yet,\" said Ms Ling, who yesterday downgraded her full-year growth forecast of headline CPI from 2.8 per cent to 2.4 per cent.\n\n\"CPI inflation for the first 10 months of this year is averaging only 2.4 per cent, and there appears to be little reason to expect a sudden uptick in inflation, especially from the imported inflation front, for the remaining two months of the year,\" Ms Ling added.\n\nWhile Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Chua Hak Bin also thinks it likely that this year's CPI will fall below the government's projected range of 2.5-3 per cent - he forecasts inflation to average 2.3 per cent this year - he, like UOB's Mr Tan, believes the pass-through of domestic costs will become stark in 2014.\n\n\"It'll be a different story in January ... A lot of wage adjustments are lumpy, and they tend to happen at the start of the year. We'll probably get a feel of how hefty they are, I suspect, only in the January and February inflation numbers. Chinese New Year is also a popular time for price adjustments as well,\" noted Dr Chua.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It started 2013 at 3,167 and closed at 3,172 last Friday: a measly gain of just 5 points in almost 11 months.\n\nTwelve months ago, there was a sense that the worst was over for the global economy, that the money printing by the US was working and turning its economy around, and that China would continue to grow strongly while avoiding a hard landing.\n\nSo it was that the investment community was generally bullish for the year that lay ahead; one local house, for example, said it was not unreasonable to expect the STI to gain 24 per cent.\n\nNo criticism is due here, though, for those who missed the mark - very few experts could have foreseen the significant role that the fear of quantitative easing (QE) tapering by the US Federal Reserve would play in rocking emerging markets. Nor would it have been possible to predict the various problems investors had to deal with, such as the difficult Italian elections in February, sequestration, and the US government's shutdown last month.\n\nHowever, it is interesting to see that despite the natural tendency of brokers and banks to try as far as possible to paint an optimistic picture for their clients (after all, pessimism doesn't really sell), there were a few who went against the grain and issued sobering assessments a year ago of what investors could expect.\n\nIn other words, while some were wildly off the mark, there were those who got it almost spot-on correct.\n\nPerhaps the most accurate prediction was made by Nomura Equity Research. It said in its Dec 3, 2012 Singapore Equity Strategy report titled \"Restructuring clouds outlook\" that, at best, the market would produce only a single-digit return for 2013, \"with the possibility of a negative return if the economy turns out worse than expected\".\n\nNomura went on to say the year was likely to see \"lacklustre\" trading, and that it was bearish on property developers and neutral on banks.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see if the STI (which, as noted earlier, is only 5 points to the good for the year) does indeed slip into the red in the next five weeks.\n\nThen we have DBS Vickers, which in a Jan 4, 2013 report titled \"Global over local\" said Singapore would underperform the region. \"The Singapore economy will continue to face a slow-growth high-inflation environment in 2013 due to the sluggish global economic outlook and domestic restructuring from efforts to tighten foreign labour policies,\" said DBSV.\n\nIt said the STI's downside was limited to 3,050, while upside was capped at 3,260. Last Friday, the index's 2013 low and high were 3,004 and 3,454 respectively. So DBSV's estimate of the low was almost on the dot, while its projected high turned out to be a bit too conservative.\n\nIn the meantime, OSK DMG said in a January report that \"investors concerned with global macro-economic developments are unlikely to invest aggressively in equity markets\". It forecast a year-end STI of 3,251, based on a sum-of-the-parts analysis - only 79 points away from last Friday's close. There's still time yet for this prediction to be proven correct.\n\nAnother broker deserving mention is CIMB. It downgraded Singapore from \"overweight\" to \"neutral\" a year ago, saying that 2012's outperformance, lack of earnings growth and restructuring-induced cost pressures would act as headwinds.\n\nCIMB said the eurozone would not break up despite the fears which abounded at the time. It also predicted that the US would overcome the \"fiscal cliff\" fears hampering markets at the start of the year.\n\n\"Ahead, investors could price out doomsday scenarios and stretch for growth,\" said CIMB. \"Singapore could lag as it is not associated with growth.\" Blunt, but honest.\n\nLast but not least, Morgan Stanley in its Nov 26, 2012 Asean Equity Strategy report said although it expected Asean to deliver an average return of 9.9 per cent for 2013, Singapore was its least preferred market, with a projected return of just 2.8 per cent.\n\n\"In our view, Singapore has the poorest earnings visibility . . . although it has the least policy and political volatility, its high external trade and capital linkages make the macro environment quite vulnerable to global growth,\" it said.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see if these houses can maintain the same predictive accuracy for 2014 - a year in which Fed tapering is expected to kick in. Or could the others redeem themselves? Stay tuned as we check back in a year's time.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But this is no longer just about picking out unexplored sectors to zero in on and make winners of, as they once did with electronics, petrochemicals or biomedicals.\n\nRather, the next big things now are the ligaments connecting these industries: potentially disruptive technologies such as 3D printing, digital advancements, consumer analytics, supplier networks, and access to the growth market of Asean.\n\n\"What Singapore has done to date is to build up very strong industry verticals,\" says Yeoh Keat Chuan, managing director of the Economic Development Board (EDB). \"Competitive, they stand very well on their own. What we started doing about a year ago is, we started to look at the connections between the verticals and ask 'Can we strengthen that?' And as a result, 'Can we build clusters of clusters?'\n\n\"I think moving forward, you will see a mix of approaches and outcomes,\" he said in an interview with BT.\n\nSo EDB, the government's lead agency for planning and executing Singapore's economic strategies, will continue to explore new industry clusters, or \"verticals' in EDB parlance. But only those adjacent to the city-state's existing strengths will be developed further.\n\nMr Yeoh said: \"We moved into biologics. Why? Because we had strengths in pharmaceuticals. It was something of a leap. Companies said making large molecules is quite different from small molecules. But we sent Singaporeans abroad to be trained and they came back and built it up.\"\n\nThere are now eight biologics facilities here - $2.4 billion worth of investment that has generated 1,700 jobs so far.\n\nSimilarly, the satellite industry, \"the new kid on the block\" for which $90 million has been set aside, has been identified as an emerging area of growth because the skills needed are closely related to those deployed in Singapore's electronics, aerospace and precision engineering sectors.\n\nCritical to Singapore's future economy, however, are the \"horizontal\" planks which cut across multiple sectors. Hence this is where the bulk of the $500 million set aside for \"the future of manufacturing\" earlier this year in Budget 2013 will be put to work.\n\nOne type of connecting tissue all sectors would gain from is a strong regional supplier base and network. Some $250 million of the $500 million earmarked will go to supplier development to ensure local suppliers meet the highest manufacturing quality standards and to building a regional network.\n\n\"This time around, we looked beyond Singapore's borders and boundaries. We're a small island; it doesn't really make sense for us to do everything here. We have to work closely with our neighbours to see how we can form a much more complementary ecosystem,\" Mr Yeoh said.\n\nOther \"horizontals\" include advanced manufacturing technologies that may disrupt production cycles: 3D printing or additive manufacturing, robots, Asian consumer insights, and big data.\n\nData analytics is one \"horizontal\" that extends beyond manufacturing to established services sectors here: security, healthcare, urban solutions, retail, finance, and supply chain management.\n\n\"We felt that the positioning for Singapore was to be a global hub for applied analytics enabled by data. Again, not the basic science, but the applied analytics: how to predict for supply chain management what you will need, or when engines must be sent for servicing,\" Mr Yeoh said.\n\nEarlier this year, Lenovo launched its global analytics hub in Singapore, adding to an analytics-based supply chain centre IBM launched last year, and Deloitte's data analytics think tank set up in 2011.\n\nThe government has said it hopes to train 2,500 data analytics professionals over the next five years, but feedback from companies already suggests this may not be enough, the EDB MD said. Prioritising the \"horizontals\" alongside \"verticals\" is no sudden shift in gears, said Mr Yeoh, who rose through EDB's ranks to become its MD last July.\n\nAfter all, it has been more than four years since the lead agency for planning and executing Singapore's economic strategies first articulated its \"host-to- home\" strategy - one which \"is gaining a lot of traction\", Mr Yeoh said. It is perhaps EDB's broadest \"horizontal\" stroke, to get global and Asian businesses to view Singapore not just as a kindly host, but a home to plunge their roots deep into, with regional headquarters, innovation and talent.\n\nHe cites examples of companies that seem to agree with EDB's pitch. Unilever's chief operating officer, GlaxosmithKline's officer in charge of all markets outside of the United States and Halliburton's intelligent completion tools business chief - they all sit in Singapore now. Applied Materials has its most advanced vacuum chambers manufactured out of Singapore, while Unilever, Sony and Samsung have also set up corporate universities or global training facilities here.\n\nYet, successive rounds of policy changes to slow the growth of foreign manpower over the last four years have led foreign business chambers and companies alike to voice discomfort at the reduced ease of hiring even skilled talent.\n\n\"Talent is always a critical success factor. The question for us is how do we work with our universities to ensure that they are providing the right training to meet our industry's needs,\" said Mr Yeoh.\n\nIn his view, preparing people for new jobs is also about capturing imagination and sparking a sense of excitement in Singapore's youth over future job possibilities. That too, is part of EDB's role, he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We respect JAL's decision to suspend some 787 service on specific routes,\" a Boeing spokesman said.\n\nThe move followed six incidents from April to November involving five 747-8s and one 787 when aircraft powered by GE's GEnx engines suffered temporary loss of thrust while flying at high altitude.\n\nThe problem was caused by a build-up of ice crystals, initially just behind the front fan, which ran through the engine, said a GE spokesman, adding that all of the aircraft landed at their planned destinations safely.\n\nBoeing on Friday issued a notice prohibiting the affected aircraft from flying at high attitude within 50 nautical miles of thunderstorms that may contain ice crystals.\n\nJAL said on Saturday it would replace Dreamliners on its Tokyo-Delhi and Tokyo-Singapore flights with other types of aircraft while also dropping a plan to use 787s for its Tokyo-Sydney route from December.\n\nJAL will continue to fly 787s for other international routes, which are unlikely to be affected by cumulonimbus cloud for the time being, a company spokesman said.\n\n\"The aviation industry is experiencing a growing number of ice-crystal icing encounters in recent years as the population of large commercial airliners has grown, particularly in tropical regions of the world,\" the GE spokesman said.\n\nGE and Boeing are working on software modifications to the engine control system, which they will hope will eliminate the problems, he added.\n\nThe 787 can be powered by either GEnx engines or rival Trent 1000 engines made by Rolls-Royce plc, while the 747-8 is powered exclusively by the GE engine model. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

It is fully leased to Optus Administration - a unit of SingTel Optus, the second largest telecommunications company in Australia - for a weighted average lease term of 8.6 years with fixed annual escalation of 3 per cent.\n\nSpeaking to BT, CEO Nicholas McGrath said that what attracted them to the property was the credit worthiness of the tenant and the trust's strategy shift in wanting to move more into business parks.\n\nAt the same time, the weaker Australian dollar and interest rates \"at historic lows\" also drew it to the market, where the network and real estate expertise of its two Australian sponsors, AIMS Financial Group and AMP Capital, gave it a competitive advantage.\n\nPost-acquisition, its Australian assets would make up 18 per cent of its portfolio, while its \"business park/hi-tech space\" slice of the pie would also grow from 16 per cent to 30 per cent.\n\n\"We want our exposure to be predominantly in warehouse and logistics as well as business parks,\" Mr McGrath said.\n\n\"We look at the Singapore government's policy and see that lower-value uses of land such as manufacturing are moving offshore, while land use for warehousing and logistics to serve ports and airports, hi-tech light industries and knowledge-based business parks such as JTC's one-north are growing. It makes sense for us to ensure that our investment strategy aligns with the government's strategy,\" he said.\n\nOn a pro forma basis, this acquisition is likely to boost the trust's distribution per unit and distribution yield by 5.7 per cent and 5.6 per cent respectively, while net property income yield will increase to 6.6 per cent from 6.3 per cent, he added.\n\nCBRE had last month valued the property at A$377 million in the open market. The value of a 49 per cent stake would therefore work out to A$184.7 million - on par with the trust's purchase price.\n\nAIMS AMP will fund the acquisition by drawing down on its new five-year Aussie dollar term loan facility, which provides a substantial natural currency hedge, as well as its existing dual currency SGD/AUD revolving credit facility.\n\nMr McGrath added that the trust has been using interest rate swaps to fix its interest rate exposure for the next three years, as well as \"favourable interest rates\" to enter into funding arrangements with banks to push up debt maturities.\n\nAll these, ahead of the imminent tapering of the Fed's bond buying programme, which is likely to \"reduce easy money sloshing around in the market, normalise rates in Europe and the US, and affect interest rate sensitive vehicles like Reits\", he said.\n\nThe acquisition is subject to unitholders' and Australian regulatory approval.

As it fell to a six-month low of 101.94 to the dollar yesterday, the Nikkei 225 stock average market hit a six-month high of 15,942.60.\n\nThe weakening yen is good for Japan's exports although Mr Sasaki pointed to changing corporate structures in Japan, whereby more goods are manufactured overseas than in the past. Also, rising import costs could limit the benefits of currency deprecation.\n\nSpeaking at the Paris Europlace International Forum in Tokyo, Mr Kuroda acknowledged that the BOJ's inflation target is \"very ambitious\" but said that other leading central banks have set similar inflation targets and that the BOJ had been among the last to do so.\n\nIt is proving difficult to reverse the deflationary psychology brought about by 15 years of falling prices in Japan but deflation expectations are finally ending and core consumer prices are turning upwards, he pointed out.\n\n\"There is a long way to go but we have already achieved a positive inflation rate,\" he said. The BOJ promised in April to double Japan's monetary base within two years and also to double the central banks' holdings of Japanese government bonds within a similar time frame.\n\nMitsuhiro Furusawa, Vice-Finance Minister for International Affairs, also claimed at the forum that deflation is coming to and end and Japan's economy is expanding as a result of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's \"Abenomics\" stimulus policies.\n\n\"Real GDP (gross domestic product) is growing, deflation is coming to an end, business confidence is improving and corporate profits are picking up,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Boeing received over a US$100 billion in orders at the recent Dubai air show - it is in large part the engine makers who are driving the mega sales, say experts.\n\nThey may not be as well-known as Boeing or Airbus, but the major engine manufacturers - US companies General Electric and Pratt and Whitney, Britain's Rolls-Royce and France's Safran - account for major part of the aviation market.\n\nEngines account for about a quarter of the total cost of an aircraft, according to Richard Aboulafia at the aerospace and defence consultancy Teal Group.\n\nThe numbers are not insignificant - GE took in US$26 billion orders in one day at Dubai.\n\nBut engines have also been a major source of innovation - it is the gains in fuel economy that are boosting orders of new aircraft by airlines.\n\nWhile carriers need to add aircraft to meet air traffic growth, which is doubling every 15 years, sustained high oil prices have pushed airlines to seek competitive advantage by acquiring new-generation models that promise savings on fuel.\n\nAt Dubai, Boeing's new long-haul 777X struck a record product launch for a commercial airliner by value, with a debut of US$95 billion in orders.\n\nBoeing says the new version of its biggest commercial success will burn 20 per cent less fuel while carrying more passengers.\n\nLike the 787 Dreamliner, some of the gains in efficiency will be from using lightweight composite materials, but mostly they will come from the engines.\n\n\"When a manufacturer announces a new aircraft model, the engine makers draw upon the technologies it feels are ready to propose a motor that offer a performance gain of 10 to 20 per cent\" from existing models, said Marc Ventre, Safran's deputy chief executive for operations.\n\n\"For engine makers it's an ongoing process, because if you don't have new technologies ready, you can't offer a new engine,\" he added.\n\nMr Ventre said it can take 20 to 25 years to develop a new motor.\n\n\"The jet engine development programme typically takes longer than an aircraft development programme,\" said Rick Kennedy, spokesman for GE Aviation, whose GE9X motors will power the twin-engined, twin-aisle 777X, which is to enter service around 2020.\n\n\"Now, there are clear examples where jet engines drive aircraft designs,\" he added.\n\nHe pointed to the 1980s, when the reliability of the new motors pushed the International Civil Aviation Organisation to allow aircraft with two engines to make transoceanic trips.\n\n\"So jet engine technologies drove the move toward larger twin-engine aircraft, such as the 777, 787, and A350 aircraft,\" said Mr Kennedy.\n\nMr Ventre said engine manufacturers conduct their own studies of the aviation market to be able to help anticipate what aircraft makers will want.\n\nSometimes, they get an engine design ready before aircraft makers are ready.\n\n\"In the case of the Leap, it is clearly the engine which precedes the plane,\" Mr Ventre said of the motor which Safran is manufacturing with GE Aviation in a joint venture.\n\n\"When in 2008 we announced at the Farnborough air show that we were capable of offering a new engine with new technologies that would reduce fuel use by 15-16 per cent, none of the aircraft manufactures was launching a new plane,\" said Mr Ventre.\n\nBut the next year China's Comac announced it would use the Leap for its entry into mid-size single-aisle segment, the C919.\n\nAirbus followed in 2010 with the announcement of the new version of its medium-haul workhorse, the A320neo - the moniker stands for new engine option.\n\nThe builder offers airlines the option of the Leap or Prat and Whitney's Geared Turbofan engine which will be ready in 2015, with the Leap due for delivery the following year.\n\nBoeing followed suit some six months later, announcing in 2011 it would update the 737 into the 737MAX, whose main change is the adoption of the Leap. -

But revenue-hungry governments are looking to impose tougher rules on so-called transfer pricing that could make it harder for firms to trade goods, services or assets between their Singapore and overseas entities. As a result, accountants warn that the city-state will need to review the level of transparency in its tax incentive schemes and get stronger justifications from companies on their transfer pricing arrangements to fend off challenges from other jurisdictions.\n\n\"Singapore's challenge is to ensure that it stands ready to adequately address any kind of unilateral tax action taken by other countries,\" said Abhijit Ghosh, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Singapore. \"In this brave new world of fiscal competition for the tax dollar, dispute resolution will be on the increase and Singapore will need to focus more resources on enforcing and defending its principles of value creation in international forums.\"\n\nThe city-state's government says it is against artificially contrived arrangements constructed \"solely for the purpose of flouting or exploiting loopholes in tax rules\", according to a spokeswoman from the Ministry of Finance. However, Singapore is also arguing that it should not be singled out because it has low tax rates. \"We must guard against new forms of protectionism masquerading as tax harmonisation,\" the spokeswoman said. \"We should avoid converging on high taxes globally as this would only hurt growth and jobs.\"\n\nCompanies justify booking significant amounts of revenue and profits in Singapore by the fact that they often run key business functions such as finance and operations, hold intellectual property rights there or base regional executives in the city. Apple says its Singapore base includes finance, operations, online sales and customer support functions.\n\nKey driver\n\nSingapore lures international companies with its reliable legal system, skilled, English-speaking workforce and high living standards. However, its low tax rates and generous tax incentive programmes are one of the biggest draws and have been a key driver behind the economic success story of the island.\n\nThe Group of 20 (G-20) big developed and emerging economies has backed a draft OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) plan that would give tax authorities greater rights to \"re-characterise\" transactions and ignore inter-company contracts if they believe they are aimed at channelling profits into low-tax countries.\n\nAlthough its size pales as a consumer market in comparison with the likes of India or Australia, Apple's Singapore-booked revenues for the year to September last year exceeded the US$10.7 billion of net sales it recorded in the rest of Asia-Pacific, excluding Greater China and Japan.\n\nIt recorded a post-tax profit on its continuing operations of US$186 million that year, with an effective tax rate of 6 per cent, according to company filings lodged with Singapore accounting authorities.\n\nApple's Singapore operations featured in a US Senate report detailing how US companies structured their operations to book the majority of their non-US profits in low-tax jurisdictions. The report, published in May, described the circuitous legal trip taken by a batch of Apple products made in China and destined for Asian markets.\n\nThe \"title\", or legal ownership, of the shipment is bought first by a unit in Ireland called Apple Sales International, before being sold on to Apple South Asia Pte Ltd in Singapore.\n\nThe Singapore unit, which is owned by another Irish entity - Apple Operations International - then sells the products to other Apple subsidiaries in Asia, third-party resellers or Internet customers. The gadgets may never even touch Singapore shores, according to the Senate report. Another Senate report in 2012 said Microsoft Corp had shifted some of its intellectual property to a Singapore subsidiary, as well as entities in Puerto Rico and Ireland, to take advantage of lower tax rates.\n\nMicrosoft Singapore Holdings Pte Ltd owns a Bermuda company called Microsoft Asia Island Limited (Mail), an entity that has no employees but shares 10 per cent of the software giant's research and development activities, according to the report.\n\nMail holds the right to sell Microsoft products in Asia, and then licenses those rights to another Singapore entity, Microsoft Operations Ltd (MOPL), which then sells Microsoft products across Asia. In 2012, MOPL earned around US$6.3 billion according to company accounts filed in Singapore, posted a profit from its continuing operations of US$368.7 million and paid an effective tax rate of 12 per cent.\n\nSignificant presence\n\nSuch legal arrangements are part of the focus of the G-20 and OECD projects to ensure that companies do not book profits in low-tax jurisdictions when most of the activity that generated those earnings went on elsewhere.\n\nApple said in a statement to Reuters that it has had a significant presence in Singapore since 1989 and employs more than 2,000 people. \"In every country where we do business we pay all the taxes we owe and uphold the highest ethical standards,\" it said.\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment on its tax arrangements. The company opened its first Singapore office in 1990 and bases its regional headquarters, its Singapore sales and marketing operations and its Asia-Pacific operations centre here. It employs around 1,500 full-time and contract employees.\n\nSingapore is not a member of the OECD, a 34-nation association of mostly rich countries, but has said it will support the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Report the OECD published in July this year. Singapore's headline corporate tax rate is 17 per cent - low, but not remarkably so, by international standards. Many MNCs moving to the city-state will pay a lower rate, however, as they are able to take advantage of tax incentives offered in return for undertakings such as providing jobs and capital investment.\n\n\"Tax incentives are given only if substantive economic activities are conducted in Singapore and the incentive recipient can add value considerably to our economy, such as bringing in new capabilities into Singapore or creating good jobs for Singaporeans,\" the Finance Ministry spokeswoman said.\n\nIncentives have been especially targeted at companies in industries Singapore has wanted to become a \"hub\" for - from shipping and commodity trading to funds management and biotechnology. In 2001, it also toughened further its strict banking secrecy rules, which helped boost the growth of its wealth management industry.\n\nBut as Western economies started pushing back against rich people hiding money offshore after the 2008 financial crisis, the city-state was quick to start signing exchange of information agreements with other governments including Japan, Australia and Britain, eager to protect its reputation as a clean financial centre.\n\nNow, as the net starts to fall on aggressive corporate tax avoidance, Singapore is under pressure to move swiftly again. \"We never thought exchange of information would come here, but it did,\" said a former official from Singapore's tax authority, who declined to be named due to the sensitive nature of the matter. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Mr Tandio, whose family business has been in plastics manufacturing since 1971, began in 2000 to steer his company towards developing sustainable packaging technology to replace traditional plastics in an effort to help mitigate the environmental problem.\n\nParlaying his work experience as an engineer with 3M, he spent 10 years of research and development and millions of dollars creating cost-competitive biodegradable alternatives in the hope of reducing the carbon footprint of plastic.\n\nTraditional plastic typically takes between 500 and 1,000 years to degrade. But Ecoplas bags, which have a biodegradable polymer made from tapioca, if buried among active microbes or insects, can decompose in 10 weeks, while the Oxium bag can be broken down through oxidation (exposure to oxygen and heat) in two years. Both technologies are patent-pending.\n\n\"We've found a way to make Oxium price-neutral to conventional plastics, so the Indonesian market took off almost immediately. Oxium is priced to be only 2-5 per cent more expensive than traditional plastic,\" he said.\n\nThe company currently sells around 500 tonnes of Ecoplas and 3,000 tonnes of Oxium plastic bags a month. Mr Tandio is applying the proprietary technology he developed to products with household applications such as cutlery, garbage bags, styrofoam packaging and reusable totes.\n\n\"We are supplying about 90 per cent of the local plastic shopping bag market for major retailers in Indonesia. The demand for Oxium is so high that Tirta Marta has licensed the technology to 20 plastic bag manufacturers in Indonesia. It's a question of repeating our success in Indonesia in other countries. Our first two years were focused on building the Indonesia and US market. Only in the past year, we started marketing our technology to China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines.\"\n\nApart from the price- competitive factor, also driving the switch to degradable plastic bags in Indonesia was an agreement signed in February 2010 between the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin) and the Jakarta city administration to encourage retailers to phase out regular plastic bags from next year, and instead offer non-plastic bags or degradable bags.\n\nPresently, Singapore does not have similar legislation, Singapore Environment Council (SEC) executive director Jose Raymond said, citing several reasons why the use of biodegradable bags is not more widespread here.\n\nAccording to the SEC, bags made entirely of bio-based polymers might have a lower environmental impact than the oxo-degradable alternative, but the lack of such options here to date make these an unlikely solution to the problem of plastic bag wastage for now.\n\nIn 2011 alone, consumers in Singapore used about 3 billion plastic bags.\n\n\"The usage of plastic bags in Singapore is a multi-faceted issue for which there is no simple solution. Economic considerations have to be balanced with environmental and commercial and even personal interests,\" Mr Raymond said.\n\nConsumer complacency that a degradable bag would disintegrate even if disposed might lead to higher rates of littering.\n\nOxo-degradable bags are also not designed for material recycling. A typical plastic recycling process involves reheating, during which biodegradable bags will decompose and make further processing impossible. Furthermore, the mixing of biodegradable bags in the feedstock of recycling will damage the quality of recycled products, the SEC said.\n\nOn the flip side, oxo-degradable bags require 10 per cent less raw materials to produce compared with their counterparts, and studies have also shown that the incineration of polyethylene plastic bags generates about double the amount of greenhouse gases compared to that of bio-bags, the SEC said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It has matched its economic interdependence with political integration,\" Mr Barroso exclaimed. \"Our growth model, based on international reforms and openness to external activities, is more sustainable than it was before.\"\n\nHe added that \"growth is on the rise and expected to gradually regain traction, up to 1.4 per cent in 2014\".\n\nDespite the economic uncertainty clouding the future prospects of certain countries on the fringe, the EU retains the status as the world's largest importer of both manufactured goods and services, the world's largest investor of foreign direct investment (FDI), as well as the destination of the world's largest flow of FDI.\n\nBoth the EU and China stopped short of calling the planned treaty a free trade agreement (FTA), but an EU-China trade deal is aimed at achieving much the same thing: to \"protect bilateral investment\" and \"ease market access\". They have set a goal to boost bilateral trade to as much as US$1 trillion by 2020 - almost double the US$580 billion in 2012.\n\nChina is the latest Asian country to negotiate an FTA with the EU, part of what Mr Barroso described as \"a very ambitious trade agenda for the region\".\n\nThe EU recently concluded its trade talks with Singapore and South Korea, and is in talks with Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam,and India. Negotiations with Japan kicked off early in the year.\n\nEarly this month, it began a second round of negotiations with the United States to create the world's biggest free trade deal. By now, the EU has engaged almost all the major global markets for a bilateral trade deal. These trade deals are likely to extend its lead in export competitiveness.\n\nBoth the EU and China have much to gain from having a comprehensive trade deal. China hopes to lower many of the trade barriers Chinese companies have encountered in investing in individual EU countries, and to speed up its exports to these markets.\n\nPresident Xi, quoted by state news agency Xinhua, said he hoped the European side could create a sound environment for Chinese enterprises to conduct economic and trade cooperation in Europe, and to boost cooperation in urbanisation, science, aeronautics and astronautics, and green economy.\n\nFor the EU, the immediate reward could be a slew of lower tariffs for many of its top export items, from automobiles and cosmetics, to luxury watches and wine.\n\nThibault Pontallier, Asia representative for French wine maker Chateau Margaux, says the Chinese tariff for wine stands at 48 per cent, and he is worried about China carrying out its threat (made in the summer) to punish European wine exports in retaliation for the EU's penalty on China's state subsidies to its solar panel exporters. The EU is also taking China to task for alleged dumping by Chinese manufacturers of steel fastenings.\n\n\"We don't know what's going to happen,\" Mr Pontallier says. \"For Europe, and for each country in the EU, each is weaker by itself. We are more important when we work together. It's better (for us) to go through the EU.\"\n\nChina levies high tariffs on all sorts of luxury products, on top of a domestic consumption tax, according to Fung Business Intelligence Centre. The top tariff levels could hit 150 per cent for cosmetics; 130 per cent for jewellery and precious stones; 100 per cent for luxury watches; and as high as 270 per cent for certain car models, the centre estimated. A Burberry cashmere scarf is 40 per cent more expensive in China than in Hong Kong, for instance, and a Cartier tank watch costs 36 per cent more.\n\nBilateral trade between the EU and China reached 434 billion euros in 2012. But China's exports to the EU, at 289.7 billion euros, was about twice as much as its imports from the EU, at 143.9 billion euros.\n\nPart of Europe's exports to China was done via Hong Kong, where Chinese tourists splurge during their shopping outings in the city. Europe made a trade surplus of 23 billion euros from bilateral trade of 44 billion euros with Hong Kong.\n\nThe warm relationship in trade, with the EU having been China's largest trade partners for nine consecutive years, has not been matched by foreign direct investment, however. European investments in China account for a mere 2 per cent of its overall FDI flows, whereas China's FDI to the EU was just one per cent of the EU's total inflows.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/getting-know-tech-stocks", "site_title": "Getting to know tech stocks", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nGetting to know tech stocks\n\nOver 100 firms on the SGX get revenue from technology, almost half of them from hardware production and services, writes GEOFF HOWIE\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 24, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSTEP onto a train in Singapore these days and count the number of people looking at devices in their hands or attached to a set of earphones. Perhaps it is easier to count those who aren't doing so.\n\nWhen we think of technology, our first thoughts usually centre on consumer products and applications. By definition, technology is the art of combining science and existing equipment to solve problems or make things more efficient. While consumer gadgets hog the limelight, large corporations and government agencies in Singapore spend billions each year ensuring they have the most up-to-date technology to optimise their operations.\n\nIn economics, there is an intimate relationship between technological advancements and an increase in production. Singapore's own history of rapid economic development owes much to the good use of technological innovation across a wide range of sectors, such as telecommunications, transport, engineering and financial services. Technological innovation and its successful implementation are also what help companies listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) to maintain their competitive edge.\n\nHowever, while technology plays a crucial role in the operations of SGX-listed blue-chip companies such as SingTel and Singapore Airlines, there is generally less recognition for stocks that make money from developing technology. Perhaps the best-known company is ST Engineering, which is a constituent of the benchmark Straits Times Index. Although it is considered an industrial stock by the Industrial Classification Benchmark, it derived more than a fifth of its revenue from technology, according to its FY2012 annual report.\n\nThere are more than 100 companies listed on SGX that generate revenue from technology, almost half of them from hardware production and services. Technology stocks can generally be divided into five revenue-generation categories: design manufacturing and distribution, hardware, semiconductors, software and technology services.\n\nHardware\n\nHardware refers to the devices and machinery that perform tasks for us. More specifically, hardware refers to computer equipment, such as monitors and processing units, peripherals, printing and imaging machines, consumer electronics, electronic components, mobile phones, digital storage devices and other bits of machinery.\n\nIn recent decades, much of the world's hardware has been built in Asia, particularly in low-cost China. Singapore also has large production and design facilities operated by some of the world's largest technology companies.\n\nThere are 17 SGX-listed counters that derive all of their revenues from hardware operations. Price performances year-to-date range from a 50 per cent decline for Plastoform Holdings to a 221.4 per cent gain for Amplefield. On average, these stocks have gained 17.7 per cent in price for the year-to-date period.\n\nTPV Technology, the largest hardware company on SGX by market capitalisation, listed in 1999 and provides display products, such as personal computer monitors and liquid-crystal display television. Its share price has declined 12.7 per cent since the end of 2012.\n\nThe second largest hardware company is Elec & Eltek, which listed on SGX in 1994 and on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong in 2011. Its principal activities involve the manufacture and distribution of high-density circuit boards. Its share price has declined 4.5 per cent so far this year.\n\nSoftware\n\nFor hardware to function, it needs a set of instructions. Software is the digital information package that provides these instructions. Most of the time, it includes a user interface of some kind that enables humans to interact with the piece of hardware.\n\nSoftware has many industrial and consumer-related applications. In Singapore, eight companies reported more than 50 per cent of their latest revenues from software-related operations. Price performances for software companies so far this year ranged from Silverlake Axis' 73 per cent gain to Xyec Holdings' 45.8 per cent decline. Software stocks on average have declined 1.1 per cent for the year-to-date period.\n\nIn addition to being the best-performing software company on SGX, Silverlake Axis also happens to be the largest, with a market capitalisation of $2 billion. It makes up 84 per cent of the aggregate market capitalisation of the software companies mentioned above, and 48 per cent of the weight of the 25 SGX-listed companies in both the hardware and software businesses. The company provides software services for financial institutions in Asia and the Middle East.\n\nDMX Technologies Group is a Hong Kong-based digital media company and the second-largest SGX-listed software company, with a market capitalisation of $238 million. Its stock price has declined 6.8 per cent so far this year.\n\nSemiconductors\n\nJust as software provides instructions for hardware, semiconductors relay the instructions to hardware's key components through their circuitry.\n\nSemiconductors are the bits that make our devices more intelligent and functional. They are essential components in most electronic devices. The production of semiconductors demands large investment in high-precision and research-intensive facilities, and makes up an important part of the Asian economies of Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Taiwan.\n\nDemand for semiconductors has often been used as a \"canary-in-the-coalmine\" gauge of the health of the global economy.\n\nSGX lists 10 active companies that derive 100 per cent of their revenue from semiconductor operations. So far this year, price performances have ranged from a decline of 29.4 per cent for ADV Systems to a gain of 41 per cent for UMS Holdings. Stocks on average have risen 3.5 per cent.\n\nSTATS ChipPAC listed in 2000 and is the largest SGX-listed semiconductor company. With a market capitalisation of $672 million, it takes up 59 per cent of the combined market capitalisation of the 10 semiconductor companies. Its share price has declined 8.8 per cent so far this year.\n\nUMS Holdings, the second-largest semiconductor company and best performer on the list, was listed in 2003 and is an industrial machinery company involved in manufacturing high-precision front-end semiconductor components.\n\nTechnology services\n\nWhile the three segments mentioned so far focus on the development and function of the technological product, technology services refer to the commercial application of these products across industries.\n\nAt its core, the technology services segment is about the fast transmission of information across operations to improve commercial efficiency. This is particularly important in the financial services sector where market prices and the flows of funds and money need to be reflected in companies' real-time data feeds.\n\nThere are 11 SGX counters from the technology services sector. Five of these derive all their revenue by providing technology services, while the rest get the majority of their revenue from such services.\n\nPrice performances of the 11 counters vary from a 72.5 per cent gain for Azeus Systems to a 50 per cent price decline for Declout so far this year. The average year-to-date price gain is 12.2 per cent.\n\nThe biggest SGX-listed technology services provider by market capitalisation is CSE Global, which derived its entire FY2012 revenue from providing systems integration solutions and computer network systems to clients globally. The company's share price has gained 27.6 per cent this year.\n\nNera Telecommunications is the second-largest technology services company and sells, installs and maintains IT networks, which account for 61 per cent of its total revenues in FY2012. The group also sells, distributes and services satellite communication and transmission network products and undertakes contract manufacturing for various industries. Nera shares have gained 42 per cent thus far this year.\n\nTechnology design, manufacturing and distribution\n\nMany hands make light work and it takes many more hands just to make a mobile phone do what it's supposed to do.\n\nTechnology design, manufacturing and distribution companies are predominantly focused on the many inputs that go into the production and delivery of technology goods and services.\n\nThe revenue streams associated with the design, manufacturing and distribution segment span a variety of technology products and services, such as electrical, communication products, industrial machinery, factory equipment, semiconductors and integrated chips.\n\nWhat sets these companies apart from design, manufacturing and distribution companies in other sectors is the high investment in the precision required to ensure that technology products are functional.\n\nSGX lists 12 companies that derive some or all of their revenue from design, manufacturing and distribution-related operations. More than half of these companies are from the electronic and electrical equipment sector, while the rest are from the industrial engineering, general industrials and technology hardware and equipment sectors.\n\nThe year-to-date price performances of these 12 companies range from a 6.3 per cent decline for Venture Corporation to a 55.6 per cent gain for New Wave Holdings. The counters have averaged a 25.6 per cent gain so far this year.\n\nVenture Corporation is the largest SGX-listed technology design, manufacture and distribution stock. With a market capitalisation of $2.1 billion as at Nov 20, the company contributed 73 per cent to the combined market capitalisation of the group of companies. Venture Corporation is a provider of technology services, products and solutions with capabilities ranging from design and development to product and process engineering. It derived 96.2 per cent of its revenue from design, manufacturing and distribution operations.\n\nTai Sin Electric is the second largest stock in this cluster with a market capitalisation of $145 million. The company manufactures and markets electrical cables and wires for both the private and public sectors. The company is also involved in the production of lamps. According to its FY2013 annual report, its design, manufacturing and distribution product segment contributed 38.2 per cent to its revenue. The stock price has gained 34.7 per cent so far this year.\n\nMore information on the companies in the technology sector can be found in the Market Updates section of SGX My Gateway at\n\nwww.sgx.com/mygateway\n\n.\n\nThe writer is SGX's market strategist\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However, such industries must be high-value ones as the additive manufacturing process remains quite slow.\n\nTwo industries fit this bill well and are strong clusters in Singapore: aerospace and medical devices.\n\nMr Yeoh explains, \"It is not just that the aerospace companies are here, they have been here for a while. But, we now have an increasing number of them doing manufacturing, doing development work.\"\n\nPart of Rolls-Royce's $700 million campus at Seletar for instance, is an advanced technology centre conducting manufacturing technology research. Pratt & Whitney also said earlier this year that it would bring production of its advanced Geared Turbo Fan into Singapore.\n\n\"So if you extrapolate, then you think, likely, hopefully, we will see some interest in this space,\" Mr Yeoh says.\n\nAlso exciting is the prospect that companies in other industries may want to be near to and learn from industries at the forefront of 3D printing applications.\n\n\"If we link them up, I think there is tremendous value. Some of them will show the way, and others will maybe be later adopters,\" he adds.\n\nJust last Friday, the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star) announced a new programme to develop additive manufacturing technologies for the aerospace, automotive, oil and gas, marine and precision engineering sectors. The $15 million 3D printing technologies fund will be split among six projects undertaken by Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and the Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology (SIMTech).\n\nIn fact, over the past few months, there has been a buzz surrounding investments in 3D printing research.\n\nIn August, NTU and the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) set up a joint lab for 3D printing research. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong also spoke during the National Day Rally about 3D printing of bone tissue scaffolds developed by A*Star, which have been commercialised for use by dentists by home-grown firm Bio-Scaffold International.\n\nAnd NTU announced in September that it would build a $30 million additive manufacturing centre, funded by EDB.\n\nA*Star said that the global additive manufacturing market could grow to an estimated US$10.8 billion by 2021, close to five times the US$2.2 billion in 2012, led by automotive, medical and aerospace applications.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

What would be the key message of the celebrations?\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 24, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nRay Ferguson\n\nCEO\n\nStandard Chartered Singapore\n\nSINGAPORE'S big 50 celebrations would be a fitting time to look back at the business policies and initiatives that have contributed to the growth of the Republic's highly developed economy today. CEOs and senior leaders of organisations that have been deeply rooted here for more than 50 years would make interesting interview subjects. They will be able to share unique experiences and observations over the years and pay tribute to the people and actions that have contributed to the nation's success. It would also be a good opportunity to showcase the organisations and companies that have played a part in the development of our business sector.\n\nArvind Agarwalla\n\nCEO\n\nFACT Software International Pte Ltd\n\nSINGAPORE'S journey from 1965 has been remarkable. While we have built our nation on strong foundations, we have also reached out to the world.\n\nI have a simple, yet very powerful, idea. I urge our government to gift a small flag of Singapore to every Singaporean by the year-end. Easily foldable, the flag can be carried by Singaporeans on our travels, and we can post photos on the 50th birthday website, displaying our red flag proudly.\n\nThis initiative would engage every citizen in the celebrations and create a buzz like no other. It would achieve a very important goal of involving every citizen in this historic event.\n\nJohn Koh\n\nManaging Director\n\nWMRC Private Ltd\n\nI WOULD think that besides the usual party and fireworks associated with the celebration, it is good to look back and reflect on how we, as a nation, have progressed over the past 50 years. A story can be crafted to highlight the key milestones achieved since we became an independent nation. More importantly, we need to look forward to the next 50 years. How will the Singapore Dream evolve as we pace ourselves for a centennial celebration? What can Singaporeans look forward to as we strive in nation building? What plans do we have in place to make Singapore an even better and more exciting place to live and do business in? All these and more should be addressed as we move closer to Singapore's birthday in 2015.\n\nDileep Nair\n\nAmbassador\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs\n\nTHERE should be an island-wide tableau depicting the values that have brought us to where we are today - trust, discipline, courage, industry and inclusiveness. And then the vision of where we are heading to. The key message should be keeping faith with these core values and having an unwavering eye on the future - which is ours to make.\n\nHugues Delcourt\n\nCountry Executive, ABN AMRO Bank NV Singapore and CEO of ABN AMRO Private Banking Asia & Middle East\n\nTHE focus of the golden jubilee celebrations should be on the people who played a part in Singapore's success, be it big or small. There is no better way to celebrate than to take a trip down memory lane and recount the highs and lows of Singapore's history.\n\nABN AMRO is proud to be a part of the Singapore heritage, with our first branch opening in 1858, making us the oldest bank in Singapore. The impressive story of Singapore's financial and banking sector deserves to be told, including the role of local and foreign banks in shaping the landscape and making a difference in the lives of customers and employees.\n\nAmong the things we can do to commemorate this occasion should include giving back to the Singapore community - the very people who have supported our business and without whom we will not be where we are today.\n\nChristophe Duchatellier\n\nCEO\n\nAdecco Asia\n\nSINGAPORE'S diverse people and the strong economic stability it is reputed for is a call for celebration. The key message can be on the colourful cultures and the various contributions the people have brought forth. The country has transformed from a developing nation to first-world in a few decades and not without reason. The jubilee is about celebrating the successes, strength and determination of a nation that has gained worldwide recognition ranging from social economic success to political stability.\n\nBoon Yoon Chiang\n\nChairman\n\nJardine Matheson (Singapore)\n\nHALF a century is relatively short in the history of a nation. As a small city state, Singapore is remarkable in having achieved so much in such a short time - from third to first world in 50 years.\n\nThis was largely due to a dedicated, determined and effective political leadership, which is forward-looking and enlightened, being able to work closely and harmoniously with Singaporeans of different racial origins towardsa common vision.\n\nWith globalisation and rapid technological advances, there will, no doubt, be fresh challenges ahead but also new and interesting opportunities. So long as our leaders are committed and prepared to take a long term view and are able to motivate the people to work together for a fair and inclusive society and make Singapore useful to the world without having to compromise our basic values and principles, the future will certainly remain bright.\n\nToby Koh\n\nGroup Managing Director\n\nAdemco Security Group Pte Ltd\n\nTHE Golden Jubilee is a great opportunity for Singapore to continue its nation-building exercise and create a fresh sense of identity and pride for Singaporeans. It would be a reflection of how far Singapore has come in diverse areas such as population mix, standard of education, growth and enhancement of infrastructure, national identity etc. I suggest the following:\n\nBring back the Swing Singapore party. Singapore is a fun place to live and work in. We need our version of mardi gras. This should be the party of the year and Singapore Tourism Board should plan to milk it for what it is worth.\n\nHave a \"Speak Singlish Day\". Singlish is possibly one of the strongest and most enduring Singaporean traits. The power of Singlish as a unique national identity cannot be belittled. Besides, it gives our government a chance to drop its straitlaced persona for a day.\n\nDo a campaign with mature Singaporeans who can relate the changes they have seen and experienced over the past 50 years. Nothing beats watching real accounts of life in Singapore through the eyes of Singaporeans to create the nostalgic feel to help bond the nation.\n\nLim Tit Meng\n\nChief Executive\n\nScience Centre Singapore\n\nTHE innovative use of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) is the critical success factor that has enabled our survival and transformation from an island with limited natural resources into a first world city-in-a-garden. Without STEM we would not have NeWater or our reclaimed land. We would not be able to maintain and expand our world famous Changi Airport - neither would we be able to establish ourselves as the financial hub in Asia. As we mark our golden jubilee, we should celebrate our achievements in STEM by showcasing the top 50 innovations coming out from Singapore, so as to inspire and nurture more talents in STEM to bring Singapore to the next level of excellence. The Singapore Science Festival in 2015 can be a very suitable platform to highlight how Singapore can remain competitive only with STEM being core in our innovation and knowledge-based economy.\n\nGerald Foo\n\nPresident\n\nWalton International Group (S) Pte Ltd\n\nHOW about a short guide of 50 terms and acronyms that were created and used in the nation's policy-making process, explaining how they propelled the country to grow into a first world nation? It can also include government institutions that played a significant role, such as the CPF or the HDB.\n\nFor example \"tax free holiday\" was introduced as an incentive for companies to set up operations here during the Jurong industrialisation phase. Then, to curb our car population and congestion, we had COE and OMV. To encourage Singaporeans to have more babies, we had SDU, among other measures.\n\nBecause the guide tracks the development of Singapore, it can be used to educate future generations and foreigners on how this tiny city state, against all odds, grappled with the challenges in the past 50 years and got to where it is today.\n\nYeoh Oon Jin\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nPwC Singapore\n\nAS we celebrate Singapore's 50th year of independence in 2015, it would be timely for us to reflect on not just how far we have arrived economically but also on how we have progressed socially and culturally. It presents a great opportunity for us to recognise the people and the organisations in Singapore who have contributed significantly to Singapore's development in different areas like public service, business, sports, the arts, culture, etc. We should also celebrate people who have made sacrifices or have risen to challenges in key crisis situations such as the Sars outbreak.\n\nLooking forward, I think it is crucial that we define what is success for Singapore in the next 50 years, not just based on economic indicators but on how we develop holistically as a nation. There needs to be an inclusive approach where every stakeholder's opinion matters.\n\nTan Tiong Cheng\n\nChairman\n\nKnight Frank\n\nTHE golden jubilee in 2015 will mark a significant milestone for Singapore. Having emerged from many trials in the early years of independence to reaching First World status within 50 years, we must always remember, with gratitude, how we have overcome all odds to reach where we are today. The future will be challenging, yet we can thrive as a nation if our citizens stay united and determined to build Singapore together. The spirit of \"Unity, Courage, Commitment and Compassion\" should be celebrated and magnified in various activities during the golden jubilee year, to remind us of our core values that bind us as a cohesive nation to forge ahead without fear.\n\nThe year 2015, too, is also a particularly significant milestone and memorable year for all at Knight Frank Singapore as it is our 75th anniversary.\n\nPhillip Overmyer\n\nChief Executive\n\nSingapore International Chamber of Commerce\n\nFROM the beginning of Singapore's independence, the nation has been blessed with not only hardworking Singaporeans but also foreigners who have played various interesting roles in its development. Particularly prominent are talented foreigners who have transferred significant product knowledge, technologies and business knowhow to spur Singapore's economic growth and, along the way, lift Singaporeans' capabilities. SICC would like to suggest that as part of the golden jubilee celebrations, the country brings a few good old comrades back from around the world to let them relish the grace and wonders of Singapore today, as each in his or her own way remembers Singapore's unique history that they have helped to create many years ago. Also worth celebrating will be our national business champions that have successfully left global footprints through determination and sheer hard work. Asia Pacific Breweries, Banyan Tree, Capitaland, Charles & Keith, Keppel Corp, PSA Corporation, SIA and many more local companies have made Singapore proud overseas. The message to inspire Singaporeans will be that, just as the Singapore economy and its homegrown players can punch above their weight, so can each and every Singaporean who dares to dream big and who is willing to persevere. Regardless of their career aspirations to become an outstanding entrepreneur or a first-rate worker, Singaporeans should believe they have what it takes to succeed and, along the way, strive to open new chapters in Singapore's history that will be well remembered in future years.\n\nSeah Kian Peng\n\nCEO (Singapore)\n\nNTUC Fairprice Co-operative Ltd\n\nFIRST, we should all take a moment to reflect on and appreciate what our country has achieved over the past 50 years - there could have been many different outcomes and, so, our achievements given our limited resources and diverse culture is all that more remarkable. It is also a time to recognise the collective contribution of the people of Singapore - citizens from all walks of life who have in their own ways contributed to this remarkable 50 years of nation building. Likewise for the business, social and community sectors and, of course, our leaders over the years. As we adopt an inclusive approach in these celebrations, we need to also appreciate the challenges that we will face in the next 50 years as we invite all citizens to paint a new narrative and a vision of what we want to create for Singapore for our next generations.\n\nTony Ang\n\nManaging Director\n\nAedas Singapore\n\nTHE golden jubilee is a significant milestone for Singapore as a city state that has transformed dramatically into a first world nation since independence. With the emergence of world class architecture in recent years, 2015 will be a good opportunity to share Singapore's story of nation-building with the display of the eclectic mix of heritage and modern day architectural designs - a proud reflection of Singapore's success against a cultural kaleidoscope backdrop.\n\nWhilst we celebrate what we have achieved and work towards becoming the city-to-be for the future, the celebrations can look towards the next 50-year milestone in an ever-changing built environment. Aedas would be privileged to be a part of it.\n\nDora Hoan\n\nCo-Chairman/Group CEO\n\nBest World International Ltd\n\nTHERE should be a meaningful celebration that reflects how far Singapore has come. Having the celebration at the new sports hub would be suitable in view of the new and improved facilities. This venue will be a clear demonstration of how Singapore has progressed from a humble island state to a confident cosmopolitan nation. Perhaps the government may also wish to consider a longer celebration by declaring an additional day of public holiday (the National Day will fall on a Sunday in 2015). There can then be more fringe activities to excite the people (and boost retail sales). Let us show our confidence; let the whole nation really partake in the festivities on this joyous occasion.\n\nZaheer K Merchant\n\nRegional Director (Singapore & Europe)\n\nQi Group of Companies\n\nCOUNTRY celebrations and festivities range from music, parades and fireworks to commemoration of the restoration of \"dignity\". Marking Singapore's golden jubilee of independence is momentous. I hope we have all of these interspersed with one key message: sustaining our invaluable cultural diversity and unity. The integration of different races, languages and religions has permeated the very core of our society. Coupled with our work ethic and \"never-die spirit\", it has resulted in our spectacular successes in the global economic arena and other aspects of society. More than pomp and splendour is our need for a strong message on our core values, while being inclusive of the less fortunate. Only then will we live true to our pledge of one united people achieving progress for our nation.\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nSINGAPORE is still a very young nation - yet we boast a rich cultural history. The golden jubilee celebrations should thus focus on Singapore's history and culture, and how far we have come in the past 50 years. It would be wonderful to have a series of grassroots and nationwide celebrations leading up to our grandest National Day Parade ever. Besides the razzle and dazzle, I would like to see something meaningful done for society. For a start, we could bring back some of the previous civic programmes we used to have, such as the national courtesy campaign. Additionally, the relevant ministries could perhaps work together to kickstart a pilot programme to have every school working with social welfare organisations in a concerted manner. For example, our youth can befriend the elderly either in old folks homes or those living alone. Hopefully, this can evolve into a long-term initiative that continues beyond the golden jubilee year. I believe that this can help to instil the right values in our young - the future leaders of this nation - as we strive to cultivate a more gracious society for all.\n\nShawn Balakrishnan\n\nGeneral Manager\n\nThe Hoffman Agency Singapore\n\nIN Singapore's upcoming golden jubilee, we should celebrate our achievements over the past 50 years by showcasing to the world - the People, Education and Infrastructure that make up the building blocks of our blooming country. With so much to rejoice about, the golden jubilee should be marked by a whole year of celebration and activities that will capture memories of the vast changes and developments in our culture and cityscape over the course of our short but rich history. Most importantly, these activities will remind us of what makes us uniquely Singaporean and how we can continue to make Singapore a country we are all proud to call home.\n\nLeong Soo Yee\n\nHead\n\nACCA Singapore\n\nHAVING come a long way since its independence in 1965, human capital was and still is the backbone of Singapore's success. Through the years, we have come to appreciate and celebrate our multi-faceted society and the vibrant and diverse cultures that form our rich social fabric. One possible theme for Singapore's 50th anniversary is therefore the \"Celebration of Diversity\".\n\nThe composition of Singapore's workforce is becoming increasingly diverse because of the changing needs of the economy and businesses. In order for Singapore to remain competitive in this challenging business environment, we must embrace and celebrate diversity in all its aspects: racial and cultural diversity, diversity in gender, thought, background and opinions, to continue to create opportunities for all.\n\nAs Singapore strives towards becoming the region's leading global accountancy hub by 2020, I urge fellow Singaporeans to continue to celebrate diversity and embrace change for the continued success of the Republic.\n\nTerry Smagh\n\nVice-President\n\nQlikView South East North Asia (SENA)\n\nAS a country and an economy, Singapore has gone through many challenges. The early years of independence coupled with the outbreak of Sars in 2003, along with the Asian financial crisis in 2008/2009 have all proved that this brave nation and its people have and will always remain resilient in the face of adversity. With the golden jubilee only two years away, the key message of the celebrations should be about the importance of always looking at ways to improve as an individual and how we can contribute back to society to make sure our sons and daughters will live as comfortably in the future as we did.\n\nAnother key message is the importance of team spirit. As the country charts its course to maintain growth and progress, its citizens' contributions and unity will continue to be the core pillars of a successful and fruitful future. As the saying goes, you are only as good as your team. Here's to another successful 50 years ahead.\n\nJ David Crammond\n\nCEO & Founder\n\nMaachu Pte Ltd\n\nWHEN Singapore celebrates its golden jubilee in 2015, I feel that its citizens must come together to forge a new and meaningful vision that rallies the nation to strive for many more golden years.\n\nI first came to Singapore 10 years ago as the CEO of a company and, since then, I have become an entrepreneur and started Maachu, a Singapore technology firm, to match the skills sets and experience of applicants to specified jobs. I hope Maachu can play a contributory role to facilitate the growth of talent in the next phase of nation building.\n\nSingapore's foundation of success was laid by the pioneering immigrants who strove to establish themselves. Next came the visionary politicians and the enterprising businessmen and women who made Singapore a first world country. Today, we need more nimble and talented entrepreneurs to perpetuate this journey of growth and excellence.\n\nTan Hak Leh\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nAIA Singapore\n\nSINGAPORE'S golden jubilee should be a celebration of the strength of the family unit, which is the building block of our society. As we continue to create a cohesive community, let us also reflect on how families can be further empowered to live fuller lives together. Two important aspects are to bolster their resilience through sound financial planning and by encouraging families to adopt a healthier lifestyle. AIA Singapore believes in the combined efforts of the public and private sector, together with the individual, to ensure Singaporeans are adequately insured and stay healthy. As we work together to achieve this, AIA Singapore will continue to serve the nation's protection needs and invest in Singapore's health through initiatives such as AIA Vitality, so that families can lead happier, healthier lives together.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPLAN-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\nA UNIFYING theme such as \"Our people first - always\" will not only address the concerns of Singaporeans today but reassure them that their livelihood and wellbeing will always be taken care of in the future. It is an important statement for the government to make, going into the golden jubilee. Singaporeans today are concerned about losing jobs to foreigners, the high costs of living, healthcare, transportation, homes - not to mention the overcrowded MRT, long wait for public housing, etc. The 50th anniversary is a great opportunity, following the national conversation, for the government to reassure Singaporeans and make an unequivocal and strong commitment to look after Singaporeans, and to ensure that everyone has a fair share of the economic growth and prosperity. An \"Our people first - always\" theme will take the celebrations to a new high. It will be remembered not just for the celebrations of the country's many accomplishments but also for the emotionally appealing new compact between the government and citizenry. Although the future may seem more uncertain for Singaporeans, there should be no doubt that there is much to look forward to and, therefore, cause for celebration and jubilation.\n\nSam Yap\n\nGroup Executive Chairman\n\nHTwo Investment Holdings Pte Ltd\n\nFORMING an S50 Committee to plan the country's 50 years of independence is a right move to ensure wide participation from all segments of the nation and getting ideas from all walks of life. The celebrations should include documentation of our experiences as a young nation in our journey through these 50 years.\n\nA commemorative book reflecting our journey through these years would serve as a good reference of our history, especially for our younger generation to appreciate the contributions of our pioneering leaders. Recognising people, both local and foreign, who have contributed to our growth is important. Possibly a special S50 Golden Jubilee Fund should be set up for deserving pioneering generation Singaporeans who may now need help in their golden years.\n\nIn my view, the key message should be that we should always be integrated as a nation, be team players, and that everyone has a part to contribute, regardless of where they stand in society.\n\nAngeli Beltran\n\nManaging Director\n\njobsDB Singapore and Malaysia\n\nSINGAPORE has come a long way from its humble beginnings to the truly global city it is today. Riding through times of economic crisis and financial difficulty, Singapore has always been resilient, striving to excel and achieve its true potential as a nation. jobsDB is similarly all about providing the best job opportunities for Singaporeans to explore their true potential in their careers. As Singapore turns 50, I believe the key message should focus on learning from the nation's past 50 years, to ensure the country continues to prosper for the next 50 years and beyond. May its spirit of exploring opportunities and achieving excellence continue to bring the Singapore nation to greater heights.\n\nDavid Leong\n\nManaging Director\n\nPeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd\n\nSINGAPORE is an accidental nation. For the country to survive miraculously the trials and challenges to reach 50 years is a great feat, and for it to become a First World developed nation in the same time is a greater feat. This would not have come to pass if not for the great determination, grit and convictions of our first-generation leaders.The 50th jubilee celebration must not miss out on marking the life of every pioneering Singapore leader. The public should nominate a list of 50 leaders, each to be featured in a good writeup. Singaporeans should know their leaders' journeys and be inspired by their dedication to our nation. The arts and culture that form the tapestry of our diversity must also be highlighted and celebrated. Our artists can be spurred to put up their creative works for all to see and to support. These can be small public projects or large commissioned works of art - sculptures, murals or statues - that can serve as a reminder of our past and of the present to celebrate our limitless hopes and collective hearts.\n\nDhirendra Shantilal\n\nBoard Director & Head, Asia Pacific\n\nFircroft\n\nTHE golden jubilee is a great opportunity to share Singapore's remarkable achievements and to set a new vision for the future. Our highly skilled workforce has been integral to our nation's success and transformation into a global metropolis. Singapore is now home to many top talents and we should mark the golden jubilee by celebrating our people. We should showcase top talents in different industries and also demonstrate how these industries have evolved. An example is in the engineering and technical sector, which has been a cornerstone of Singapore's economic growth. We remain dedicated in developing the engineering and technical talent pool in Singapore for the oil and gas, power and energy and engineering services industries which require specialist knowledge and niche skill sets.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the early 1800s, it was a thriving port of call while Hong Kong was just a fishing village. Today, as Singapore is bracing for a silver tsunami, one has already hit Zhoushan's shores; its population has been declining for 11 years. It is the only city with a long-term negative population growth outlook in Zhejiang province, according to a China Daily report. Last year, one in five in the city of one million was aged 60 and above, and this will rise to two in five by 2030. By contrast, one in five in Singapore's population will be aged 65 and older by 2030.\n\nOther than increasing pension and healthcare costs, the most serious consequence of an ageing population is the shortage of workers to support the elderly. Last week, Zhoushan jumped to implement China's new reforms on the one-child policy announced after its Third Plenum meeting of top officials. A document on the Zhoushan government website released last Thursday said eligible couples in which either spouse is an only child, and who already have one child in the family, can now apply to have a second child. Observers have long pushed for China to reform its one-child policy, implemented in the late 1970s. To be fair, the policy has been relaxed over the years. Since the late 1980s, rural couples were allowed to have a second child if the first-born was a girl. The latest reforms amount to further gradual easing. Analysts have suggested that the change will lead to several million more newborns a year. But while significant, the relaxation of the rules does not go far enough. China should abolish its one-child policy. Even as it does so, a population explosion is unlikely to occur; today's China is very different from that of the 1970s.\n\nSingapore's experience is a case in point. In the 1970s, Singapore implemented a birth control policy encouraging citizens to \"stop at two\". The government reversed the policy in 1987, but fertility rates continued to plummet as Singapore joined the ranks of the world's urbanised, developed nations. As Singaporeans grew richer, they married later, and had fewer children. Women became financially independent and no longer saw raising a family as their only role in life. Couples viewed starting a family as a heavy financial burden amid a high cost of living. Immigrants had to be imported to keep the economy humming, but resulting social and infrastructural strains caused a political backlash.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So as long as the central bank keeps its benchmark rate close to zero, the rise in mortgage rates and Treasury rates should be gradual and easy for the economy to digest.\n\nThe holiday-shopping season starts earlier every year, and stores such as Best Buy are now launching their annual holiday sales on the morning of Thanksgiving itself, this Thursday. In effect, the sales have already started at Wal-Mart Stores, Best Buy and other outlets which are matching offers that customers find advertised on rivals' websites.\n\nInitial indications of consumer response to the sales this week will give investors a preview of crucial fourth-quarter earnings prospects for publicly traded stores. Wal-Mart, the world's largest store chain by sales, warned that it anticipates the toughest holiday season since 2009 as a price war looms.\n\nEconomists at brokerage Wells Fargo predicted a \"modest 3.7 per cent\" increase in holiday sales from 2012. That's a lesser rate of growth than a year earlier. An October National Retail Federation (NRF) survey of shoppers forecast a 2 per cent decrease in per-person spending over the season.\n\n\"Americans are questioning the stability of our economy, our government and their own finances,\" said NRF president and CEO Matthew Shay.\n\nThe same survey found that the average person would do nearly half their shopping online this year. That suggests that Amazon.com will enjoy the festivities, even if operators of malls do not.\n\nSeveral companies have timed the launch of new gadgets with the holiday season. Sony's new PlayStation will vie with Microsoft's new Xbox for the attention of gamers.\n\nAny signs that holiday sales growth is more than modest could spark a strong finish for the 2013 stockmarket rally - which has brought the Standard & Poor's 500 to the brink of its highest-returning year since 1997.\n\nSmall-cap indexes such as the Russell 2000 and tech-heavy indexes such as the Nasdaq 100 have had even stronger returns, reflecting a new appetite for fast-growing, risky companies.\n\nSome of the fastest growing and riskiest companies, including video-streaming service Netflix and electric-car maker Tesla, suffered a precipitous decline early last week and have not recouped all their losses.\n\nAnalysts had warned that these stocks could not sustain their monumental gains forever. Some even suggest that these stocks reveal the bubble characteristics of the broad market.\n\nValuation metrics like price-to-earnings ratios do not bear out this fear, however. Even though charts of the broad Standard & Poor's 500 in the last three years closely resemble those of the 1920s and 1990s, in the steep run-up to major crashes, the valuations of most stocks this time are more in line with historical averages than during the dotcom boom.\n\n\"It's really an unwarranted concern out there,\" said Eric Marshall, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital. \"Currently, the higher beta (or more volatile) stocks are going through a little bit of a reset phase. In any healthy bull market you get these types of selloffs, which, I think, help keep the euphoria of optimism at bay.\"\n\nMr Marshall said bear markets - such as the dotcom crash and the 2008 financial crisis - typically strike when everyone is fully invested in the stock market.\n\nEven after a rush into stocks this year, many Americans are still shying away from stocks in their retirement savings. According to Gallup, the percentage of Americans owning stocks was near an all-time low as recently as May.\n\n\"Bull markets don't end with everyone sitting on piles of cash,\" Mr Marshall said.\n\nStill, even the bulls concede that the economy and corporate earnings now have high expectations to live up to. While stocks are likely to continue their run into January as workers partake in the annual reallocation of in their pension funds, most believe the rally will need some more corroboration to keep going for the rest of next year.\n\n\"Additional and sustained gains would require an acceleration of earnings growth to catch up with valuations, which, even in the bullish case, would require more time,\" said Lorenzo Di Mattia, manager of hedge fund Sibilla Global Fund, in a note to clients. \"The stars are aligned well, with the economy showing a moderate pick-up and the Fed offering accommodation, which should continue given the nomination of Yellen. At some point though, things will be as good as they get.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It then dipped in the next two recessionary years to below US$6.4 billion. Then there was a spike in 2010 when exports surged to US$9.5 billion - an increase of more than US$3.0 billion in just a year.\n\nEven accounting for the setbacks in 2008 and 2009, the pace of US private services exports to Singapore has quickened after the Great Recession. It picked up by US$1.0 billion in 2011 when exports hit US$10.51 billion. And last year, the export of US private services to Singapore rose even higher by US$1.75 billion to US$12.25 billion.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2012, shipments of US private services to Singapore soared more than 90 per cent. There was no similar post-recession spurt in the export of Singapore services to the US - largely travel and related business and freight and port services - to the US. The increase was a more moderate 40 per cent.\n\nBut over a longer period, Singapore is making better progress than the US in the balance of trade in private services. From 2002 to 2012, the export of Singapore services to the US jumped 149 per cent to US$4.9 billion while US exports to Singapore rose 123 per cent. The result is that the US's trade surplus in services with Singapore narrowed from 2.8 to 2.5 times.\n\nThis could change if US firms persist in their post-recession aggressiveness. The renewed US push overseas is worldwide but most evident in high-growth Asian markets. While the export of US services increased 28 per cent in 2009-12 overall, it rose 41 per cent in the region.\n\nWithin Asia, the US appears to be most aggressive in Singapore where the shipment of US services has surged 91.2 per cent since 2009. This is followed by China (89.2 per cent), Taiwan (77 per cent), South Korea (41.6 per cent) and Australia (41.5 per cent).\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Iceland has vast amounts of spring water naturally filtered by mountains and lava terrain for hundreds of years that otherwise goes to waste, he said.\n\nAqua Omnis's plan offers an alternative to costly water desalination and recycling as supplies are reduced by climate change and rising demand from the agricultural, and oil and gas industries. By 2030 almost half the earth's population may face water scarcity, according to the UN.\n\n\"We have an abundance of high-quality spring water underneath our surface which we are offering to the world,\" Mr Gudnason said recently in London at the IEA & Marketforce conference. \"It flows from Iceland into the ocean, quenching no one's thirst.\"\n\nIt will cost US$300 million to start the initial project including a minimum of seven ships, fuel and mooring equipment, the company said. Conditional funding agreements are in place from investors including parties in Gulf nations, Mr Gudnason said. The company plans to start commercial operations within three years, he said.\n\nAqua Omnis will transport water from springs using second-hand vessels from the oil industry. Some tankers will be able to carry 500,000 tonnes. It can also move the water in \"flexitanks\" made of the same material as plastic bottles that can be transported in trucks or smaller ships.\n\nIt plans to use ultra large crude carriers, some of which may have been deleted from the official register though not yet scrapped, and then refurbished, Mr Gudnason said.\n\n\"They can be as good as new or even better as new vessels would need to be overhauled anyway to carry water,\" he said. \"Whether we use exactly 500,000 dwt (deadweight tonnage) vessel or 441,500 dwt or a portfolio of different sizes of vessels is not really the main issue to us,\" he said.\n\nIn England, Aqua Omnis could sell the water for about US$2 per tonne, according to Mr Gudnason. Thames Water Utilities charges US$2.05 a cubic metre, where one cubic metre is 1 tonne, for household water supplies.\n\nThe water flowing from the aquifers to the Atlantic through streams under land Aqua Omnis owns in Olfus in south-western Iceland is drinkable, a quality \"unheard of\" outside the country, he said. The tankers will moor just off shore and deliver water directly to distributors without requiring treatment, he said.\n\nBallast water that can sometimes contain invasive species isn't an issue because the water collected from Iceland is uncontaminated after being filtered for years underground, he said.\n\nThis isn't the first time Iceland has planned to share its resources. A plan for an undersea power cable to connect the British grid to Iceland, which has abundant geothermal and hydropower, is attracting investor interest, Charles Hendry, a former UK energy minister, said this month. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

His American opponent, the young upstart Brandon Rios, is an underdog who knows he is on the brink of superstardom should he upset the odds and defeat Pacquiao.\n\nIn all, 15,000 people will pack the Cotai Arena at the Venetian Macau integrated resort - the flagship property of Las Vegas Sands' operations in China - to watch the biggest boxing event ever held in Asia.\n\nIt all spells big bucks for Edward Tracy, the president and chief executive of Sands China, who is already planning to bring in more high-level boxing matches to Macau next year to feed the growing demand for this sport.\n\n\"(Sunday) is going to be very successful for us. We're very happy with the ticket sales and the pay-per-view numbers so far,\" he told BT Weekend in an exclusive interview yesterday.\n\nThat this event would be broadcast to a Saturday night prime time audience in the United States due to the time difference, as well as to millions more around the world, will help change the perception that Macau is purely a destination for gambling.\n\n\"I think people are going to view Macau differently, and that's part of the government's strategy here,\" said Mr Tracy.\n\nAs far as Sands China is concerned, he sees boxing and other non-gaming activities as part of the company's overall development strategy to attract a much broader range of customers, especially the rising middle class from the mainland.\n\n\"(We want) to have such a diverse offering that people think about us in a very different way, that there is so much to do here and that's why they want to come to Macau, and not because we happen to have baccarat tables,\" he said.\n\nThe world of boxing is not alien to Mr Tracy, who has been involved in the sport for close to 30 years to date.\n\nAs the former CEO of the Trump Organization, he was responsible for putting together some of the most memorable fights in history in the 1980s and 1990s, including the historic clash between Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield in Las Vegas.\n\n\"I did a lot of those with (professional boxing promotion company Top Rank CEO) Bob Arum. This 'Clash in Cotai' is kind of a page out of our playbook from those days, but with a modern and Asian twist to it,\" said Mr Tracy.\n\nBy Asian, he means giving Chinese boxing fans the chance to see their heroes in action tomorrow as well, chief of whom is two-time Olympic gold medal winner Zou Shiming.\n\nThe 32-year-old - one of the most recognisable athletes in China today - made his professional debut in April this year at the Venetian Macau and returned to the same venue for another event three months later. He won both fights, sending the largely Chinese crowd into raptures.\n\nMr Tracy believes having such a boxer will be key to unlocking the gold mine that is the 1.3 billion population in China.\n\n\"The demand for these kinds of boxing events in China is pretty spectacular. It's something that's very new to China, having seen other sports like basketball, golf and tennis. Boxing is something new to the marketplace, and there seems to be really high demand for more of it.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Bankers at CIMB only recently celebrated its first anniversary Down Under, with red and white cupcakes - the colours of the bank's corporate logo.\n\nKeen to depend less on its home market, Malaysia's No 2 bank by assets agreed in 2012 to buy parts of Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc's (RBS) Asian business, including most of its Australian unit.\n\nSo far, there has been no buyer's remorse.\n\nCIMB was the sole underwriter and bookrunner for a stake sale earlier this month worth A$503 million (S$575.2 million) in the world's No 4 iron ore miner, Australia's Fortescue Metals Group Ltd.\n\nThe Warrnambool mandate had also thrust CIMB into the thick of what is now a A$505 million takeover battle. Key to that role was CIMB's ability to retain a core group of experienced investment bankers who had worked closely together under the RBS banner.\n\n\"The RBS franchise they purchased had been a longstanding part of the local scene, and had strong existing relationships,\" said Lachlan Colquhoun, head of markets analysis at research and advisory firm East & Partners.\n\n\"The transition team at CIMB would appear to have done well in preserving some of the relationships... while beginning to establish their very own franchise, which also has its own point of difference - the link to Asia which none of the other competing investment banks really have to the same extent.\"\n\nWarrnambool already had a close relationship with RBS before CIMB took over the business, said Oscar Ludwigson, who was a senior RBS banker in Australia before becoming CIMB's head of investment banking in the country.\n\n\"We haven't got paid every year... but that's not the point. The point is that they are a client of ours and we have stayed close to them,\" Mr Ludwigson said.\n\nWarrnambool wasn't immediately available to comment on why they had appointed CIMB to advise them on the deal.\n\nCIMB faces serious competition in the Australian investment banking market, with RBS historically not a significant player.\n\nThe corporate advisory realm in Australia is currently dominated by Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Macquarie Group Ltd and UBS AG. Together, the banks command 65.3 per cent of the market, with UBS taking the lion's share at 22.4 per cent, according to East & Partners.\n\nRBS's banking status in Australia and elsewhere was also weakened by the misfortunes of its UK headquarters, bailed out in a taxpayer rescue amid the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\"CIMB didn't really take over a strong business, it was already badly weakened after several years of lack of love,\" a banker said, requesting not to be named talking about a competitor.\n\nNor has the CIMB team been helped by the bank's brand, which lacks the recognition that some of its competitors enjoy in Australian boardrooms.\n\nNow, as dairy rivals slug it out to buy Warrnambool, CIMB and its legacy RBS bankers are up against some of Australia's established investment banking names.\n\nAmong them is the chief executive of Lazard Australia, John Wylie, who is leading Murray Goulburn Co-operative Ltd's charge in the takeover battle. Mr Wylie is a well-known investment banking figure, who in a sports-mad nation also chairs the government's Australian Sports Commission.\n\nAlso in the mix are Rabobank and Rothschild, advising Canada's Saputo Inc, while Kidder Williams Ltd is advising Bega Cheese Ltd.\n\nIn Australia, CIMB has extended its capabilities and added new people including Aaron Lamshed, who has been helping to drive its equity capital markets business.\n\nMr Ludwigson said Mr Lamshed was integral in the Fortescue deal - a block of shares that a person familiar with the sale said was sold by Canada's Teck Resources Ltd.\n\nThat deal helped CIMB rank second in Australian equity capital markets this quarter, giving the bank a market share in the segment of 13.6 per cent for the period, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n\nCIMB may get a US$4.7 million payday for its role in the Warrnambool deal, according to an estimate from Thomson Reuters/Freeman Consulting Co.

Chipmaker Intel intends to play a significant role in these developments.\n\nPrakash Mallya, country manger for sales and marketing at Intel Singapore and Malaysia, revealed during a recent press briefing that the continuous \"revolution\" in computing means it is no longer feasible for many data-centre operations to remain manual.\n\nHe noted that in terms of provisioning servers, storage and networking to support business applications, these processes are not automated. The time taken to get these online in order to run an application is also too long, and this would impact the business's nimbleness and ability to respond to market trends.\n\nTherefore, he believes SDDCs are the way to go to power forward-looking enterprises. Intel's vision for this is to make it possible for the applications to \"talk\" directly to the infrastructure layer so that quick deployment and optimisation are achieved. This means developing \"software hooks\" or APIs (application programming interfaces) and introducing these to enterprises, he elaborated.\n\nThis doesn't mean the United States-based chipmaker will now become a software house and develop operating systems to manage data centres better. Rather, it is intent on building up the overall technical expertise within the IT industry and accompanying ecosystem to achieve the software-driven data centre ideal, Mr Mallya explained.\n\nThe company has set up a test-bed site in the US to develop products and services related to driving the SDDC adoption, he added. This is in addition to its core business of constantly improving the raw horse power of its processors to support the running of next-generation data centres and applications, he noted.\n\nOne example of how Intel is contributing to the ecosystem is in Big Data analytics. The executive said while more organisations within Asia are moving beyond the interest stage and committing to proof-of-concepts, the resources needed to run Big Data analytics in real time and \"full steam\" is just too costly.\n\nThis is why it came up with its distribution of Apache Hadoop, which is a tool that helps to collate and mine big datasets for insights. Not only did Intel optimise the software to work with its Xeon processors and technologies such as Hive and HBase, it also included security and manageability functions to what is essentially an open source tool in Hadoop, the executive said.\n\n\"Intel is trying to drive down cost (of doing Big Data) through Apache Hadoop,\" Mr Mallya reiterated.\n\nBesides innovating on the technology, Intel is also building up the ecosystem, he noted. For instance, it is one of the key partners - together with Dell and Revolution Analytics - for Malaysia Big Data player Pulse. It is an early-stage start-up aimed at offering analytics-as-a-service for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), he said.\n\nIn an August press release, Pulse said the four companies are working together to offer Big Data analytics infrastructure, solutions, training and proof-of-concept for innovative projects for businesses and government organisations in the region.\n\nThe Intel executive attributed the rise of social media for the increasing need for Big Data analytics capabilities across all businesses, not just enterprises. \"The advent of social media and the propensity to use (these services), especially among the younger generation, has changed traditional business intelligence to Big Data analytics,\" he said.\n\nIt is in understanding how consumers in this demographic, who have the spending power and desire to spend, that companies will be able to better monetise their Big Data initiatives. Intel understands this, and wants to help companies move towards this outcome, the executive added.\n\nHe qualified his observations by saying that there will not be \"droves\" of companies adopting Big Data in the coming year. In fact, within Asia-Pacific, there will only be pockets of interest deploying proof-of-concepts. That said, he is confident that more will jump aboard once the early adopters illustrate successful deployments and business benefits in time.\n\nIntel's moves are in line with market growth projections. According to research firm IDC, the global big data and services market is expected to hit US$23.8 billion by 2016. It is also projecting spending on Big Data in the Asia-Pacific, excluding Japan, region to reach US$603 million this year - which is an increase of 42.6 per cent over 2012.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Chat software makers call them \"stickers\", and companies think they're the main key to making money today.\n\nVoice app Viber is the latest to jump on the apps bandwagon. It was first launched in end-2010 and is one of the oldest players in the market of chat apps, standing out from the rest of the herd because it's the only one which started as a voice app.\n\nThe Cyprus-based company is positioned as a Skype competitor, and still bills itself as a \"free calling\" app. But it has started to tag on the \"free messaging\" line as well.\n\nWith the stickers and the focus on text-chatting, Viber is starting to compete more closely with the likes of US-based WhatsApp, Korean app KakaoTalk, WeChat from China and Japan's Line.\n\nThese are native text chatting apps and don't have phone-calling functions.\n\nViber's CEO and founder, Talmon Marco, told BizIT that the company is expecting a high percentage of its 200 million users to download the new, free stickers. Last week, it released a float of 300 free stickers, expecting to hit the thousand-mark with paid packages eventually. \"Many of these were designed for users in Asia,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the company is confident that users will be keen to download and pay for these stickers. It's pricing each pack of stickers at US$1.99.\n\nThe stickers won't be Viber's only source of revenue, however. Mr Marco revealed that his company has a plan for various revenue streams - and this is the first, although he couldn't elaborate on future plans.\n\nOne source of revenues might be telco deals. Viber in September signed up with Indonesian operator Axis to offer unlimited use of Viber for a flat fee from users.\n\nThese deals are attractive to telcos because of the added revenue package they can sell downstream, as well as getting more users hooked on data usage - potentially signing up for more premium monthly accounts down the line.\n\nThe sticker tactic isn't just a pure revenue play; each app maker has said that stickers are a way to elevate the chat experience above mere text, in the hopes of attracting users with unique stickers.\n\nSocial network Path has said that stickers are \"pieces of art . . . They are expressive and fun, and they communicate what words can't.\"\n\nFacebook, which currently offers free stickers, said: \"Stickers are different from emoticons. They're detailed illustrations of characters with personality. Sending stickers is a way to share how you're feeling with your friends.\"\n\nViber's 200 million users deem it to be among the more popular apps in the market. WhatsApp is still the undisputed leader, with 350 million monthly active users in October - that is, users who have logged in at least once a month to the app.\n\nWeChat, which is produced by Chinese company Tencent, has about 195 million active users per month, across a base of 300 million registered users.\n\nMarket leader Whats- App is perhaps the only chat app that hasn't jumped into the sticker market yet.\n\nThe company is valued at between US$2 billion and US$4 billion with an enormous user base. Its last round of funding was US$8 million back in 2011. Rumours have surfaced of a potential IPO for the company down the line.\n\nCurrently, Viber has 50 employees and development centres in Belarus and in Israel.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But while their western counterparts are doing it, the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Council says that Asian companies are not keeping up with the move.\n\nThe council, which has more than 7,000 members worldwide, is a network of senior corporate marketing leaders and brand decision-makers across a wide range of global industries.\n\nIn an Adobe-sponsored survey of 276 senior marketers in the Asia-Pacific region, the marketing trade association found that Asian companies struggle with limited budgets and are lacking in the skills needed to initiate full digital campaigns.\n\nThese campaigns include analytics and reporting metrics that track and indicate how well marketers' efforts are doing.\n\nThe survey report concludes: \"In more mature markets, digital is more than just display, mobile or social advertising. It is advancing to a data-driven, targeted and connected experience with customers at the centre. These countries see higher levels of senior management support that are enabling more tools and technologies to be deployed and leveraged.\"\n\nHisamichi Kinomoto, Adobe's vice-president of marketing, Japan and Asia-Pacific, said that Singapore, Australia and India are leading users of analytics in the region. Across the Asia-Pacific, 80 per cent of companies said that they were measuring and testing their digital campaigns, with 28 per cent of Indian marketers saying they were able to do this well.\n\nAround 21 per cent of Australian and Singaporean companies said the same, but in contrast, Hong Kong, China and Korea only returned a 9 per cent, 7 per cent and 3 per cent positive response, respectively.\n\nThe CMO Council findings correlate with this. It shows that 67 per cent of Australian firms, 65 per cent of Singaporean firms and 60 per cent of Indian firms had the support of senior management when it came to implementing digital technologies.\n\nIn China, Hong Kong and Korea, these numbers were 27 per cent, 44 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively.\n\n\"Businesses in Singapore, Australia and India are gaining confidence, taking a more aggressive approach to investment, enjoying higher levels of executive support, measuring more complex and sophisticated metrics and building more dynamic business cases for return on marketing investment. In other countries, however, marketers continue to struggle with low budgets and haphazard agency support, and they are working hard to measure the right elements to convince senior management that their business case for greater investment is water-tight,\" said Mr Kinomoto.\n\nBy 2015, digital advertising will take up 36 per cent of the total marketing budget in the US, while in Asia, that proportion will be at 29.4 per cent.\n\nThis trend runs contrary to the growth of the online audience in Asia, especially those with mobile devices.\n\nAccording to ComScore, 41 per cent of the world's Internet population now resides in Asia. And 78 per cent of the region's online audience is under the age of 45.\n\nOn the mobile front, 40 per cent of smartphone users and 35 per cent of tablet users globally will come from Asia.\n\nTo compare Asia with the more established Western markets, reports also point to more than half of the world's mobile phones being in Asia today. This is more than 10 times the number of phones in North America.\n\nIn Singapore, social media is a particularly favoured channel. Social media was the top priority for 78 per cent of marketers this year, up from 68 per cent in a similar survey done last year.\n\nDavid Scribner, head of Virgin Mobile in Australia, said that the telco has a large data warehouse that collects information from customers, and it has built social media into its SAP backend system. He said the company tends to use social media first for its campaigns, before bringing in traditional media afterwards to support it.\n\nWang Li-Na, head of consumer marketing for StarHub in Singapore, said she is focused on making her team lead their campaigns digitally, rather than have digital distribution seen as another channel within a larger media plan.\n\n\"The challenge has been to get our backend processes and IT systems up to speed to support our digital initiatives,\" she added.\n\nThe CMO Council said that overall, Asia still lags behind North America in its digital marketing performance and readiness but the gap is closing fast. Marketers keenly understand that there is no time to allow this evolution to happen slowly, it said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

CASUAL,\" says the receptionist, eyeing my dining companion's business shirt and suede loafers with some disdain as she mouths into a walkie-talkie, well within earshot. \"We have an $80 minimum spend per person for dinner,\" she adds as she hands you an elevator pass for the 57th floor.\n\nWell, well. What a long way the Ku De Ta brand has come since its founding in 2000 as a casual beach bar on Bali's Seminyak strip, where one could just wash up from a dip in the sea to drink in the sunset on a sandy daybed.\n\nRun by a separate management team who also runs the brand's month-old Bangkok offshoot, Ku De Ta Singapore is like a trendier, haughtier grown-up sister ready to shrug off her humble beginnings. And though it's been four years since her much-feted debut atop the Marina Bay Sands, she's working harder than before to fashion herself as a trendy, modern Asian affair comparable to the likes of Nobu and Hakkasan.\n\nIn its latest coup, the restaurant has roped in a brand new executive chef - the UK-trained Frenchman and four-year alumnus of the Nobu group, Frederic Faucheux - to further vamp up its Pan-Asian cuisine.\n\nRather than overhaul the menu, Faucheux is taking it slow, penning in new creations among existing dishes on the menu, which waiters only help to identify upon request.\n\nWe kick off with chopped yellowfin tuna tartare ($28) served with yuzu soy garlic dressing on a nest of thin udon. Against expectations, it is the simple udon that is the dish's selling point. Cooked to textbook perfect bounce, the noodles get a refreshing brightness from the citrus dressing. The fish, unfortunately, lacked both seasoning and general flavour.\n\nA single yamamomo, or Japanese bayberry - sweet yet simultaneously acidic - appears on the side as a palate cleanser and as a nod to mentor Nobu Matsuhisa's signature practice in his restaurants.\n\nThe yutaka roll ($34) is a complex combination of foie gras, salmon skin, cucumber and lightly torched scallops that pushes the Asian fusion envelope slightly too far. Though the crackle of the salmon skin is a delight, the buttery soft pate of foie gras and the subtle sweetness of the scallops are lost in the too strongly vinegared sushi rice. Even for those bent on indulgence, there can be too much of a good thing.\n\nSimilarly, a lighter hand would benefit the lobster claw tempura ($32), which is coated in a batter more fluffy than wispy that obscures the claw's flakey, milky sweetness.\n\nMuch more deserving of praise are plates that don't try to straddle the East-West divide as obviously, such as the Australian lamb rack ($38) glazed with walnut jus and grilled to a sunset-pink medium doneness; as well as the decidedly Asian halibut ($32), steamed till fork-tender and flakey, complemented by healthy diced pickled carrots, konbu and steamed bak choy.\n\nDesserts sound great on paper, but are hit-and-miss on the plate. Intercontinental marital bliss is portrayed in the garam masala and chocolate ($18) comprising a dense, aromatic chocolate brownie lifted by a berry sorbet, contrasting with a white chocolate panna cotta. But there are awkward arrangements too, like the tear-inducing wasabi ice-cream ($18) with crunchy cubes of fresh pear and chocolate mousse.\n\nThe restaurant also does tasting menus for $158++ per person for parties of two or more, and lunch has a more corporate feel compared to dinner, when the restaurant's balcony doors are thrown open to the breezy outdoors, and a live DJ spins upbeat lounge music.\n\nLooking out towards the clear skies rather than downwards on Singapore's cityscape, one can easily be transported back to the laid-back beaches of Bali. Except prices here aren't quite casual, and everyone around has spiffy shoes.\n\nRating:\n\n6.5\n\nWHAT OUR RATINGS MEAN\n\n10: The ultimate dining experience\n\n9-9.5: Sublime\n\n8-8.5: Excellent\n\n7-7.5: Good to very good\n\n6-6.5: Promising\n\n5-5.5: Average\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Thailand and Vietnam also show potential, she said.\n\nConsumer preferences are developing in the same pattern as in other emerging luxury markets, Ms D'Arpizio said. While Chinese consumers are becoming more sophisticated and turning away from conspicuous logos in favour of unusual design and craftsmanship, Southeast Asian shoppers still \"seek out more visible, recognisable luxury\", she said.\n\nThe ubiquity of smartphones, however, means there are new opportunities as well as obstacles for luxury companies as they woo consumers in South-east Asia and beyond.\n\nAccording to Bain's research, online transactions now account for 5 per cent of all luxury sales around the world, and mobile is driving a third of that traffic. While mobile-driven sales are still a very small part of the total global luxury market, retailers recognise that they are growing and are updating Internet strategies.\n\n\"Most advertisers started their digital journey with desktop digital devices and traditional websites,\" said Ravi Thakran, group president of LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton for South Asia, South-east Asia and the Middle East. \"Mobile is definitely a key tool in South-east Asia markets. All of us have started to increase our pace in developing mobile sites or relevant apps to reach our consumers.\"\n\nLast year, Kering, formerly called PPR, whose brand portfolio includes Gucci, Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga, began to see mobile marketing as a necessity instead of a \"nice to have\" addition to traditional Internet marketing, said Federico Barbieri, the company's senior vice-president of e-marketing.\n\nKering introduced sites optimised for users with smartphones and tablets. It also created new analytics dashboards, so each of its more than 20 brands could track online traffic by the type of device.\n\nThe data will help brands build websites and apps that are easy to browse on different models of smartphones and tablets, Mr Barbieri said.\n\nHe noted that the challenges facing Kering's mobile developers included integrating high-quality product images that wouldn't slow navigation or download speeds.\n\n\"The website architecture, navigation and functionality must be designed with a totally different approach,\" Mr Barbieri explained. \"It's easier to adapt a mobile site to desktop than vice versa, for instance, even if I believe that going forward we will need a tailor-made approach by device.\"\n\nMr Thakran says LVMH has used online videos optimised for mobile viewing in its Asian advertising campaigns. And the company's beauty brands, which include Sephora, BeneFit and Make Up For Ever, also have sponsored weather and photo-sharing apps.\n\nLuxury brand executives say that, along with tailoring online marketing campaigns to smartphones and tablets, they need to learn how to use the mobile devices to improve service and to form connections with individual consumers that are personalised but don't feel intrusive.\n\nFor FJ Benjamin, a Singapore-based company that manages the retail operations of several luxury brands in South-east Asia, including C\u00e9line and the watch company Girard-Perregaux, tablets already have become valuable in-store marketing tools. Sales associates use them to visit brand websites and online catalogues, as well as keep track of individual shoppers' favourite styles or products.\n\n\"It's a simple, elegant way of getting brand information into the customers' hands at the time the customer is deciding on his or her purchase,\" said Ben Benjamin, general manager of FJ Benjamin's luxury division. \"It's also a great way to link the product to the global fashion market.\" - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Based on a sale consideration of about 2.294 trillion rupiah (about $249 million), this translates into net proceeds of about $237 million. The divestment will see Keppel Land realise a net gain of about $149 million.\n\nThe buyer, PT Modernland Realty Tbk, previously held a 49 per cent effective stake in both PT Mitra Sindo Sukses and PT Mitra Sindo Makmur, which own Jakarta Garden City, an integrated township. Keppel Land held the majority 51 per cent stake.\n\nKeppel Land said that its divestment will allow the company to redeploy capital to new residential and commercial projects in Indonesia, with a focus on Jakarta.\n\nThe Indonesian economy is expected to remain positive in the long term, underpinned by sound fundamentals that will continue to drive demand for quality homes and investment-grade offices, especially in Jakarta, it added.\n\nUnder the current masterplan, Jakarta Garden City will be developed in phases and will comprise about 4,000 landed homes and townhouses when fully developed.\n\nAs at end-October, 83 per cent of the 1,486 launched homes and shophouses have been sold under Phases 1 and 2. To date, over 1,100 units have been completed, with facilities such as a clubhouse, school, wet market and shopping arcade, as well as direct access to the toll road, Jakarta Outer Ring Road.\n\nApart from Jakarta Garden City, Keppel Land is currently developing Tower 2 of International Financial Centre Jakarta, which is located on a prime site along Jalan Jendral Sudirman in the city's Central Business District.\n\nWork on the 48-storey Grade A office Tower 2, located just beside the fully-leased Tower 1 and near the upcoming Setiabudi MRT station, is progressing well, with piling works completed. When completed in the second half of 2015, Tower 2 will offer about 50,000 square metres of net leasable area.\n\nKeppel Land's stock ended trading down three cents, at $3.57.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Avaya is a global provider of enterprise communications systems, software and services.\n\nAccording to the survey, many customers use different channels as they are not getting their query resolved adequately through the first channel they use. On average, it takes a customer just under four interactions with an organisation to resolve a query.\n\nWhile phone and in-person conversations remained the most common method of communication, 2013 saw a rise in the use of social media, particularly in South-east Asia.\n\nIn Singapore, almost a third of the respondents used Facebook to contact organisations for information.\n\nNearly nine out of 10 customers who have used social media in the past three months for a service query had already tried to use another channel to resolve the query. With social media, many expect to be able to get a faster response, more positive response or make sure their query is actually addressed.\n\nIn Singapore, the hospitality and tourism industry led in the adoption of social media channels, followed by retail and wholesale, and healthcare, government and education sectors in the third place. The finance, banking and insurance sector, although the slowest in adopting social media platforms, led in the use of mobile applications.\n\nApart from social media and mobile applications, another emerging channel for providing customer service across various industries is video chats.\n\nThe survey revealed that 15 per cent of respondents in the Asia-Pacific region has used this function when contacting organisations.\n\nFor those who have used video chats, 85 per cent said they were \"happy\" to \"extremely happy\" with the service interaction. The highest video usage was seen in the retail and wholesale sector.\n\nIn Singapore, consumers used video chat mainly to update their customer details, make complaints and purchase a product or service. According to the survey, the adoption of video chats is expected to grow in the region by 14 per cent.\n\n\"The importance of multi-channel communication continues to grow, and video is starting to represent an opportunity for customer service differentiation. While monitoring conversations and engaging customers via social media channels has also become increasingly important, companies need to ensure they have the right analytics and tracking tool in place to ensure they can decipher the chatter that matters,\" said Tan Meng Teck, APAC customer experience management leader, Avaya.\n\nMore consumers are also looking to resolve queries themselves, with web self-service expected to register the highest growth in usage (at 41 per cent) in the region in 2014. This will put greater pressure on supporting technology such as knowledge management and customer relationship management (CRM) tools.\n\nInstead of following what the competition is doing, Mr Tan stressed the need for organisations to listen to their customers as they look to expand the variety of channels to offer to customers. He noted that there were many cases where organisations had rushed to launch a mobile application or social media channel but had not achieved the benefits they were expecting due to poor execution.\n\nAs customers bounce around different channels, they have also come to expect a seamless and integrated experience regardless of the channel they use. For example, they expect not to have to repeat their query, account identification and information each time, and for the organisation to combine the information from the different interactions.\n\nCustomer service remains a key influencer of brand loyalty, with 83 per cent indicating they would avoid buying from a company, and more importantly, actively advise friends and family to do the same if they experienced bad customer service. The majority of consumers in the region (or 70 per cent) will spend at least 10 per cent more money with a company that consistently provides excellent customer service.\n\nIn Singapore, 65 per cent of respondents feel that interacting with customer service centres is always problematic, while less than half agreed that the service received from customer service centres has improved over the last 12 months.\n\nOverall, Singapore consumers registered the highest satisfaction with the overall interaction process provided by the hospitality, tourism and entertainment industry and the least satisfaction with that provided by telecommunications service, media and utility companies.\n\nIn terms of response times, 43 per cent of local consumers indicated they would be impressed with an organisation if they received a reply to their email in under five hours.\n\nExpectations for web chat response times are much higher, with 45 per cent of respondents expecting a response to their web chat within one minute.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The figures were not far off from the previous week's 34 trades worth $6.4 million. Buyers outnumbered sellers with 15 companies that recorded 24 purchases worth $5.4 million, versus five firms with six disposals worth $4.4 million. The number of companies and value on the buying side were up from the previous week's 11 firms and $5.2 million. The number of purchases, however, was down from the previous week's 29 acquisitions. On the negative side, the number of companies and trades were consistent with the previous week's three firms and five disposals. The sell value was sharply up from the previous week's sales worth $1.2 million.\n\nBuyback activity among listed firms rose with seven companies posting 27 repurchases worth $4.7 million. The number of trades and value were up from the previous week's 20 transactions worth $2.8 million, pushing the buyback totals this month to nine companies, 53 trades and $7.7 million. The repurchases so far this month are far below the averages for November of 2007- 2012 of 26 firms, 182 trades and $68 million. If the slow buyback pace continues, the repurchases this month will amount to a paltry 70 transactions worth $10.2 million.\n\nThe bulk of the significant insider trades last week were acquisitions, most of which were made following the announcement of earnings results.\n\nLey Choon Group Holdings\n\nExecutive chairman and CEO Toh Choo Huat picked up where he left off in one-stop underground utilities infrastructure services provider Ley Choon Group Holdings in May with 80,000 shares purchased on Nov 21 at 18.6 cents each, increasing his deemed holdings to 309.476 million shares or 52.24 per cent of the issued capital. This was made on the back of the 11 per cent drop in the share price since second-half September from 21 cents. He acquired 145,000 shares from May 13 to 14 at an average of 19.7 cents each and 200,000 shares on March 4 at 20.5 cents each. He also acquired 1.45 million shares in November 2012 at an average of 19.7 cents each and 4.026 million shares in September 2012 at an average of 22.2 cents each. The purchases since September 2012 are the chairman's first on-market trades since his appointment in July 2012. He resumed buying this month after the company announced (Nov 13) a third quarter profit of $12.766 million versus a loss of $8.196 million in the same quarter last year.

The trades, which accounted for 100 per cent of the stock's trading volume, boosted his direct stake to 14.622 million shares or 4.27 per cent of the issued capital. There was a 16 per cent drop in the share price since January from 35.5 cents. Despite the fall, the counter is still up since January 2012 from 25.5 cents.\n\nThe purchases were also made after the company announced (Nov 14) a third quarter loss of $1.799 million (versus the $5.01 million same-quarter loss last year). Loss in the first nine months was $447,000 (versus the loss of $12.298 million in the same period last year).\n\nAlso positive this year are independent non-executive director Gui Kim Young and substantial shareholder Poh Choo Bin.

It redefines the concept of the dated department store. By May Yip\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 22, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT'S been a tale of modern-day consumerism, a historical shopping haven aimed at filling the emotional and sartorial void of any cash-wielding shopaholic. But in recent years, just like the sepia-toned images of its grand abode in Raffles Place in the 1960s, the romance of local department store giant Robinsons seemed to have faded.\n\nDespite facelifts over the years (a $7 million makeover of its outlet at The Centrepoint in 2005; the opening of an upscale outpost at Marina Bay Sands in 2011 which closed in May), the shopping institution was nevertheless better known for marked-down pillows and figure-forgiving clothing that mum and gran would gravitate towards.\n\nWith shoppers milling to on-trend fashion chains, luxury boutiques and online sales sites, one would have thought that the decline of the department store was inevitable. But the retailer's new $40 million flagship, located where The Heeren Shops used to reside, is poised to breathe glamour into the department store concept. Sure, its line-up of 380 new brands, including hyped labels such as The Kooples and Elevenparis, as well as designer names such as Manolo Blahnik and Roland Mouret, may pique the purse strings of those in the know.\n\nBut the truly inspired features of the 186,000 sq ft store lies in its exercises in sheer indulgence that one would never have associated with a mass-market store. Imagine a sprawling personal shopping gallery with changing rooms, espresso machines and even an in-house hair and beauty salon; a section dedicated to furs; a vintage department with Birkins and Chanel classic flap bags nestled in a glass cabinet; and a champagne bar featuring a glass table supported by oversized fluted stemware.\n\n\"It's a revolution for Robinsons, that's for sure, but 'revolutionary' is a big word to describe Robinsons Orchard as a retailer,\" says managing director of Robinsons, Franz Kraatz, when asked how the new Orchard store is set to change the retail scene.\n\nMore evolution than revolution\n\n\"We would say that we are more into an 'evolution' than 'revolution' because we are still keeping the brands that our loyal customers love but on top of that, we are bringing in new brands that they don't know about and that we've patiently tried to find throughout the world.\"\n\nMr Kraatz, who is of French-German descent, spent seven years at luxe Hong Kong department store Lane Crawford as senior vice-president of sales and operations for seven years, before joining Robinsons. And his eye for sophisticated visual merchandising has perhaps influenced the sleek and intuitive store design, spearheaded by home-grown interior design firm Designphase DBA.\n\n\"We felt that we have tried to make it as open a space, as friendly and accessible as possible,\" explains Mr Kraatz. \"Accessibility, openness, the sense of discovery and arrival were all very important to us.\n\nWe also want to provide convenience for shoppers based on the idea of putting several brands in one category together, for example the shirt bar, where shoppers are able to see right away and decide - if they want a blue shirt, they can choose between two or three brands and zoom onto it easily rather than have to go brand by brand at different sections of the store.\"\n\nAnd amid the store's clean lines and abundance of natural light are showcases that border on the theatrical. Think shavers, pots of potions and other grooming apparatuses laid out on a bar-top like artefacts on a museum's plinth in the men's beauty section; perfume bottles encased within bell jars; and a mannequin languorously sprawled along a counter behind the cashier.\n\nAll the better to highlight the glorious merchandise located on the store's six floors, painstakingly sourced from all corners of the globe.\n\n\"It took a bit of convincing to brand principals to be part of the new Robinsons Orchard and get them to visualise our new store concept,\" admits Isabelle Tan, merchandising manager for the ladies' shoes, bags and accessories department who acquired labels such as French footwear brand Walter Steiger and Italian luxury bag label Elena Ghisellini.\n\n\"However, this challenge pushed us even harder to seek out new brands in Asia and even in countries such as Brazil, where we found the brand, Schutz.\" But would this sudden influx of indie labels or designer marques intimidate the average Robinsons shopper, seeking old-school business loafers or classic twin sets?\n\n\"I don't think it is too difficult to educate consumers on the new brands as Singapore has the highest proportion of smartphone users - everybody Googles and checks their phones for brands and information,\" says Mr Kraatz, who hopes to target a younger generation of well-travelled shoppers as well as tourists with the new labels.\n\n\"And we will naturally try as much as we can to get the brands' awareness out in the market, such as through extensive training on the brand for retail staff so that they can impart the brand information, history and ethos to shoppers.\"\n\nIt certainly seems that Robinsons may be Singapore's answer to London fashion and lifestyle emporium Selfridges or Parisian multi-label store Colette, especially with a stable of brands ranging from haute to hip, like Elizabeth and James by celebutantes Mary-Kate and Elizabeth Olsen, outre shoe company L'F Unisex and vintage Christian Lacroix accessories.\n\n\"Before the launch of Robinsons Orchard, Singapore did not have these brands to cater to customers who are well-versed with bridge fashion labels,\" says Doris Loh, womenswear merchandising manager. \"We have too many high-street fashion brands, which in my opinion, is a phase that will not last very long in Singapore's retail market.\" While it remains to be seen if shoppers are truly ready for this modern-day cathedral to material pleasures, one thing's for sure, Robinsons Orchard is going to shake things up in the department store sector.\n\n\"We have been to big department stores in cities from London to Hong Kong, and most of these big stores have revamped their store concepts,\" adds Ms Tan. \"We often hear Singaporeans commenting that shopping in Singapore is very boring, referring to department stores having the same brands. So now they have Robinsons Orchard as the destination to visit for trendy wares.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The threat is very real and is something that organisations need to take very seriously. Many of the techniques that have been used to penetrate networks are not new. The average attacker does not have to do anything new,\" he said, pointing to techniques such as cross-site scripting and SQL injection that were used in some of the attacks.\n\nA basic example of cross-site scripting is when an attacker injects a script in a legitimate site URL which then redirects a user to a fake but identical page. The attacker can then hijack the user's session. In SQL injection, code is injected into a data-driven web server that allows the attacker to gain access to the contents of a database.\n\nAdded Mr Sentonas: \"Many organisations are not aware of where the weaknesses lies or that their websites are not 100 per cent secure or kept up-to-date. We shouldn't be panicking to look for and buy next-generation security products. They may or may not be needed. The very first thing that I would do is have a look at what is working inside my organisation today, what needs to be updated and what needs to be better secured. Maybe I have technologies that do a great job but are not used correctly.\"\n\nIn addition to conducting regular vulnerability assessments and patches, he also stressed on the need for continuous education of employees so that they do not fall prey to phishing attacks that may compromise an organisation's security.\n\nIn fact, before firms start to think about technology, they should establish what information is critical to them. \"If someone accessed that information, what would happen to your business? Do you know where that information is? If you can't work out the answers to those questions, you won't know what to secure. You won't know how much you should be spending on security,\" said Mr Sentonas.\n\nHe added that many small businesses typically do not see the need to secure their data as they do not think they would be targeted by cyber criminals. However, they may be holding customer or employee information that is of interest to a hacker.\n\nMobile threats are another rising concern for organisations, particularly with the rise of BYOD (bring your own device) in the workplace. According to the McAfee Labs Threats Report: Third Quarter 2013, more than 680,000 new Android malware samples were found in that quarter, as attacks on the mobile operating system increased by more than 30 per cent.\n\nOne new mobile malware that was identified is the Exploit/MasterKey.A, which allows an attacker to bypass the digital signature validation of applications on Android devices. While Google has produced a patch and provided it to manufacturers of Android devices, Mr Sentonas cautions those who acquire applications from third-party stores or websites to ensure they install mobile security software.\n\nMcAfee Labs researchers also found two-part malware, consisting of a Trojan application that downloads a second-stage malware to a device. An example is the Android/Repane family which consists of a downloader, Android/Repane Dropper.A, and a malicious portion that sends user information to the attacker. The dropper pretends to be an application that lets users x-ray things with their Android devices but this application does not work as neither phone nor tablet cameras emit x-rays. Once users download the malware, the dropper will get them to install it in order to continue scanning.\n\nUsers also need to beware of the banking Trojan Android/Hesperbot, which pretends to be an application that produces authentication codes for online banking, but instead steals the victim's login information. It deletes its icon so that it will not be noticed. Though visible in the process list, it goes by the misleading name \"Certificate\".\n\nMr Sentonas stressed that every organisation should be using a mobile device management solution to secure the device. As for protecting data in the device, he pointed to the availability of \"container\" technology that allows e-mail to be opened in an encrypted container, and the use of a mobile virtual desktop, so users can connect back to the office without keeping any data in the phone.\n\nThe McAfee report also found that AutoRun malware, which often hides on USB drives and can allow an attacker to take control of a system, doubled at the start of the year and remained in the third quarter. At the same time, traditional malware signed with digital signatures grew by 50 per cent to more than 1.5 million samples, calling into question the validity of digital certificates as a trust mechanism.

Ngiam was promised a 3 per cent commission for the work. Thereafter, he received large sums of monies totalling $1,249,829.23 from various remitters in the US, Canada and Cook Islands. Despite his suspicions, Ngiam subsequently withdrew and passed monies totalling $850,000 to Chua in person on six occasions.\n\nNgiam received a total sum of $10,451.94 for his work. The banks of the various overseas remitters were deceived into remitting money from the remitters' accounts into Ngiam's accounts after receiving fraudulent e-mail instructions.\n\nAs a result, Ngiam was sentenced on Oct 15, 2012, to a total of 54 months' imprisonment for dishonestly receiving stolen property and transferring the benefits of criminal conduct, under Section 411(1) of the Penal Code and Section 47(1)(b) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (CDSA).\n\nChua has also been charged for dishonestly receiving stolen property and transferring benefits of criminal conduct, under Section 411(1) of the Penal Code and Section 47(1)(b) of the CDSA.

For that matter, many other telephone numbers. All they need to do when they want to make a call is to key in the company's name on their mobile phone and they will be connected.\n\nThanks to an app called CallmyName, dialling numbers will be a thing of the past. Handphone users only need to key in names to call a company or an individual.\n\nLaunched two weeks ago by Global Yellow Pages, the app is not only a convenience for consumers, it also reinforces brand recall for businesses. Said Global Yellow Pages' CEO Stanley Tan: \"It is often easier to remember names as opposed to remembering phone numbers because names are intuitive.\"\n\nDeveloped in 2008 by CallmyName, an Israeli company, the app was launched three years later and is now available in UK, Russia and Germany. The company chose Singapore to be its launch pad in Asia because of its IT-savvy population and affluence and sought out Global Yellow Pages for its established commercial relevance.\n\nAlthough a boon to businesses, the app is equally friendly for social use. In Europe, many social users take on a monicker for ease of recall or to project a persona. Likewise, commercial users whose product names differ from their registered company's name can choose to use the product name as the effective contact. What this means is that anyone who keys in the product name on his or her handphone can reach the company instantaneously.\n\nIt costs $500 to register such a name - which is the same amount as what SingTel charges for a golden number. All 120,000 business names published in the current Yellow Pages are already in the CallmyName system by default.\n\nBusinesses can go to the CallmyName.sg website to find out more. The public can download the app for immediate use via itunes app store or google play store free of charge.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Popular with trendy Korean women in their 20s and 30s, the brand is renowned as a pioneer in natural skincare. In 1979, a rocky wasteland in Jeju Island was transformed into the flourishing, chemical-free green tea fields that exist today.\n\nUsing this pesticide-free green tea, Innisfree introduced its first Green Tea Pure line in 2008 and has since re- imagined a total of 10 organic Jeju ingredients as naturally derived, environmentally conscious cosmetic ranges including volcanic stone, canola and camellia. Innisfree products are free of parabens, animal ingredients, colourants and mineral oil to maximise benefits and minimise potential skin irritation. Key product ranges include the Green Tea Line (moisturising), Jeju Volcanic Line (pore) and Eco-science Line (wrinkle care). Innisfree officially launched yesterday at Takashimaya Shopping Centre, Ngee Ann City, #B2-34/35.\n\nOil-free beauty regime\n\nONE of the early brands from Japan to give us oil-free skincare is now in Singapore. The Orbis inaugural 100 per cent oil-free skincare concept was first introduced in 1987 and now their products cover skincare, health supplements and make-up. Its best-selling Aquaforce range pumps moisture into skin, while its one-meal replacement Petit Shake helps keep weight gain at bay.

However, older data centres sited in Singapore are siphoning too much energy and are becoming a drag on the government's smart city ambitions, a senior executive at Schneider Electric has cautioned.\n\nBenedict Soh, Schneider Electric Singapore's vice-president for IT business, told BizIT that establishing a smart city requires a seamless integration of technology across six areas: water, mobility and transportation, public services, energy, buildings, and infrastructure.\n\nData centres are key to ensuring each of these functions properly and can be seamlessly integrated - which is why they are critical to the successful development of smart cities, he noted.\n\n\"However, despite the symbiotic relationship between the two, data centres seem to be a counterpoint to Singapore's journey to becoming a smart, energy- efficient city,\" Mr Soh said.\n\nElaborating, he pointed out that Singapore's farsightedness in announcing its 10-year Infocomm Technology (ICT) blueprint in 2005 - also known as iN2015 Masterplan - meant that many major players had already been lured to set up their data centres here as early as almost a decade ago.\n\nThese legacy data centres are now one of the main challenges for the local industry in terms of improving energy efficiency, though, Mr Soh said. \"This is because older data centres consume more power as they need to keep up with growing data demands and new technologies, such as virtualisation, which pushes power usage effectiveness (PUE) figures higher.\"\n\nAdditionally, energy usage is not a typical design criterion for data centres or effectively managed as an expense, particularly for older data centres. This is in spite of how electrical power costs over the lifespan of a data centre may exceed the cost of the power system installed, or the IT equipment housed in the facility, the executive said.\n\nAccording to the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA), there are currently more than 50 data centres in Singapore, of which 20 are large data centres. A typical large facility is estimated to consume the energy equivalent of 10,000 households.\n\nMr Soh said another contributor to energy inefficiency in data centres is oversizing - of power and cooling equipment, in particular. This happens when the design value of these systems exceeds the total IT load, he explained.\n\n\"While it is clear that installing too much power and cooling equipment is wasteful from an investment standpoint, it is not so obvious such oversizing can dramatically decrease the electrical efficiency of the overall system and cause excessive ongoing electrical consumption,\" Mr Soh said.\n\nThere are fixed losses in the power and cooling systems that are present, regardless of the IT load, and represent a \"dominant\" percentage of data centre physical infrastructure (DCPI) electrical consumption in a typical installation. In data centres with light IT loads, the fixed losses become a larger percentage of the total electrical bill, he explained.\n\nThis is why the assessment and planning stages of any data centre implementation play a critical role in reducing power wastage and, in doing so, cutting costs for the company, he said.\n\nSome of the questions decision makers have to ask themselves include whether they know the life cycle and productivity of existing data centre infrastructure, its current PUE, how to better optimise its availability and performance as well as reduce operating costs and manage capital expenditure, the executive pointed out.\n\nThis is why Mr Soh lauded Singapore's introduction of the BCA-IDA Green Mark for Existing and New Data Centres, as it would greatly improve energy efficiency and make its data centre sector's development more sustainable.\n\n\"(The certification) gives businesses a framework for their data centres to establish systems and processes that can improve energy efficiency as well as recommend metrics and best practices that they can follow. This allows IT managers to understand how they can elevate data centre energy efficiency during the design, planning and operating stages,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Guthrie has become a wholly owned subsidiary of the offerer and will be delisted,\" said CIMB Bank in a release to SGX on behalf of offerer United SM Holdings.\n\nIn June this year, billionaire tycoon Mr Salim and Guthrie's non-executive chairman Mr Masagung made an offer via United SM to take Guthrie private, citing low liquidity. At 88 cents per share, the offer valued the group at about $948.6 million. Mr Salim and Mr Masagung owned a combined 69.2 per cent in Guthrie at the time.\n\nListed on SGX in 1974, Guthrie is technically Singapore's oldest company, although ownership has changed hands along the way.\n\nIt was first established as a trading house back in 1821 by Scotsman Alexander Guthrie. It later ventured into rubber and general trading. In the 1980s, the company became Mulpha (Singapore), before being acquired by Mr Masagung's family in 1988.\n\nIn 2007, Mr Masagung, Mr Salim and other investors initiated an offer - first offering 39.5 cents a share before raising their bid to 43.5 cents - for Guthrie, eventually garnering a stake of over 50 per cent.\n\nIn Singapore, Guthrie partly owns Jurong Point Shopping Centre and manages nex mall in Serangoon.

But he didn't think companies would \"dump the data centre altogether\".\n\nHis company AWS started in March 2006 with its S3 product, providing cloud storage. Today, it runs nine large cloud data centres globally: four in the US, and one each in Europe, Sydney, Tokyo, Sao Paolo and Singapore.\n\nAWS' head start, combined with aggressive investments in more data centres, has given it a formidable lead in the cloud game. According to Gartner research, AWS is the undisputed leader in the public cloud market, with five times more business than 14 of its closest competitors combined.\n\nOther tech vendors like VMware and HP have often taken up the hybrid stick to beat AWS down. The common argument they raise is that companies don't want to entirely abandon their in-house data centres, because of security and compliance concerns. Many in the public sector and financial services industry, in particular, are required to keep confidential data within the physical confines of their walls.\n\nMr Vogels acknowledged that as much as the company would like clients to jump on the cloud bandwagon completely, it is aware of the demand for hybrid setups and has been working on more ways for systems outside AWS to connect and play well with the AWS cloud.\n\nLast year, AWS and infrastructure provider Eucalyptus Systems teamed up to allow the two to bridge AWS's cloud with third-party clouds such as those privately owned by enterprises. This marked another step AWS took towards opening up and embracing third parties. Some of its technologies like Simple Workflow Service help make third-party applications run nicely on both internal and public clouds. Storage Gateway and Direct Connect help to get data off private data centres and into AWS more smoothly.\n\nAWS has continued to step up the pace of its product rollout, as noted recently by AWS senior vice-president Andy Jassy. \"The pace of innovation is accelerating at AWS,\" he said. AWS released 61 services in 2010, 82 in 2011, 159 in 2012, and 235 so far in 2013.\n\nThanks to its efforts, AWS can now namedrop peers like SAP, Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, Citrix and Red Hat, all of whom have products that interface with AWS's cloud services, Mr Jassy said.\n\nThough customers still want to combine both, Mr Vogels has continued to advise them to tap the public cloud over an internal system: \"On- premise private clouds give you none of (the public cloud's) benefits; you still have to buy and own the hardware. Maybe you can improve agility a little, but you're still constrained - you're still trying to make security work. And you definitely can't go global in minutes.\"\n\nHe observes that customers in Asia seem to be quicker to get on the cloud - and they are more likely to be keen on the public cloud.\n\nThe lack of legacy infrastructure to maintain helps, and a lot of the earlier reservations about clouds being unreliable and not secure have largely been lifted, thanks to big names like Shell and Unilever on public clouds, Mr Vogels said.\n\nHe noted that Asia's connectivity continues to improve quickly, which again lowers the barrier to cloud adoption.\n\n\"Last-mile connectivity is still an issue in Asia's emerging markets,\" Mr Vogels said. (Last-mile connectivity is the ability to get to rural and far-flung places that may not be close to wired stations.)\n\nBut Asia's emerging markets are leapfrogging cellular legacy standards like 2G and 3G, which established markets need to maintain - and are able to go straight to 4G connectivity, which is about 10 times faster than 3G and more stable.\n\nThese trends are helping Asian small and medium-sized businesses to go to the cloud, because more stable connectivity means firms can tap clouds over the Web more reliably.\n\nIt's no coincidence that good connectivity in Asian markets like Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan are reasons that they have been able to adopt the cloud earlier than neighbours in emerging markets elsewhere. This year, the Asia Cloud Computing Association (ACCA) ranks them as the most ready for cloud adoption.\n\nIn contrast, while China boasts many cloud-ready factors such as a tech-savvy workforce and the building up of good hardware infrastructure, its poor connectivity proved to be a huge hindrance. China ranks only 10th in the ACCA's Cloud Readiness Index of countries.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Net proceeds would be used as working capital and to develop its three core business units: medical consumables, blood purification and orthopaedic products.\n\n\"We are positive on Shandong Weigao on this development because sale proceeds will strengthen its balance and working capital. And it is exiting a challenging business,\" said Alfie Yeo, an analyst at DBS Vickers Securities.\n\nEarlier this month, Biosensors posted a 60 per cent decline in net profit to US$11.3 million for its second quarter ended Sept 30, from US$28.2 million a year ago. This was mainly a result of lower selling prices of its products and increased expenditure.\n\nSaid Mr Yeo: \"Shandong Weigao is in a net cash position and no urgent need of money. We therefore believe this signifies Shandong Weigao's loss of confidence in (Biosensors') stent business.\"\n\nThe sale is expected to be completed on Dec 20 this year and no later than Feb 28 next year, Shandong Weigao said. Zhang Huawei and Phyllis Chan Yuk Ying, directors of Biosensors nominated by Wellford, will resign from their positions with effect from the completion date.\n\nIn the stock market yesterday, Biosensors shares closed four cents higher at $0.98.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Does it really mean that you have high blood pressure (hypertension)? A 76-page document forms the European Society of Cardiology and the European Society of Hypertension (ESH/ESC) 2013 guidelines for hypertension - a telling sign that not all the experts can agree on many of the issues pertaining to hypertension.\n\nWhile the latest guidelines state that \"it is recommended that the diagnosis of hypertension be based on at least two blood pressure measurements per visit on at least two occasions\", it recognises the limitations of basing the diagnosis of hypertension on the current definition and supports the use of home blood pressure monitoring in hypertension management.\n\nIn the latest guidelines, the criterion for the diagnosis of hypertension based on a blood pressure reading of 140/90mm Hg or more has remained largely unchanged.\n\nWhite-coat phenomenon\n\nDiagnosing a person as having hypertension is not as simple as it seems. For a long time, physicians have noticed that there are patients who have a higher blood pressure reading whenever they visit a doctor but the blood pressure reading is lower outside the clinic or hospital environment. This observed blood pressure pattern is termed the \"white-coat phenomenon\" in reference to the white coats commonly worn by doctors. Elevation of the blood pressure without reaching hypertension thresholds is described as the white-coat effect and is present in almost everyone who visits a clinic.\n\nThis is thought to be due to the activation of the nervous system by the brain. However, through multiple visits, the blood pressure can gradually decrease as a result of the person being conditioned to the environment.\n\nThe presence of the white-coat effect can also occur in those with proven hypertension and may create a false impression that the patient's hypertension is resistant to medication; this may result in excessive medication being dispensed and the patient complaining of dizzy spells at home.\n\nWhite-coat hypertension\n\nThe latest European guidelines define white-coat hypertension as clinic systolic (upper reading) and diastolic (lower reading) blood pressure readings of 140/90mm Hg and a 24-hour blood pressure of less than 130/80mm Hg; the US guidelines define white-coat hypertension as a clinic blood pressure of 140/90mm Hg and an average daytime ambulatory blood pressure reading of less than 135/85mm Hg.\n\nThe 24-hour blood pressure reading is obtained by putting the patient on an ambulatory blood pressure monitor, usually on the arm, and recording blood pressure readings at regular intervals over a 24-hour period.\n\nPatients who are considered to have white-coat hypertension do not have evidence of damage of blood pressure on the body's organs and do not require medication.\n\nData from papers published by the European Society of Hypertension in the Journal of Hypertension in 2013 and British Hypertension Society in British Medical Journal in 2000 shows that about 15 per cent to 30 per cent of patients who have elevated clinic blood pressure readings have white-coat hypertension and this is more frequently present in women than men.\n\nDistinguishing white-coat hypertension from real hypertension is important as it avoids unnecessary medication, unnecessary costs and unnecessary premium payments for insurance.\n\nIn the elderly, the administration of medication to those with white-coat hypertension can have the unintended effects of dizzy spells and falls with serious consequences. In those with white-coat hypertension, it has been noted that the clinic blood pressure can decrease by up to 15 mm Hg for the systolic blood pressure in subsequent clinic visits and probably represents conditioning of the patient to the clinic environment.\n\nIn some patients, it may require up to six clinic visits for the blood pressure to become stable.\n\nIs white-coat hypertension of any consequence?\n\nThere is evidence that patients with white-coat hypertension are more likely to develop long-term sustained high blood pressure. In one study, slightly more than one-third of patients with white-coat hypertension progressed to sustained high blood pressure over a mean period of 2-1/2 years and this progression was associated with evidence of thickening of the heart muscle resulting from high blood pressure.\n\nThose who are more likely to continue having sustained high blood pressure are those who are older with blood pressure near hypertensive limits, and those with underlying medical conditions that predispose them to high blood pressure (such as sleep-related breathing problems, diabetes and impaired kidney function).\n\nShould white-coat hypertension be treated?\n\nThe question of whether patients with white-coat hypertension should be treated remains very controversial primarily because there is data from the 2012 International Database on Ambulatory Blood Pressure in Relation to Cardiovascular Outcomes (IDACO) study to show that in men and in patients with diabetes mellitus, the presence of white-coat hypertension is associated with increased risk of heart disease.\n\nWhile there is no consensus as to when patients with white-coat hypertension should be treated, generally, those with high-risk factors for heart disease and those with evidence of damage to the body from the effects of elevated high blood pressure should be considered for treatment.\n\nEvidence of damage to the body can be detected by using ultrasound to measure the degree of narrowing of the neck (carotid artery), thickening of heart muscle (due to strain on the heart), detection of albumin in the urine (due to kidney damage) and increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nA simple indicator of significant stiffness of the arterial system is that the difference between the systolic and the diastolic blood pressure readings (pulse pressure) is more than 60mm Hg. In most healthy people, the pulse pressure is usually not more than 40mm Hg.\n\nSome advice\n\nIf you have an elevated blood pressure reading (more than 140/90mm Hg) at your doctor's clinic, you should consider repeated measurements both at home and at your doctor's clinic before starting on medication.\n\nIf however you already show evidence of organ damage from sustained high blood pressure, you should commence medication. If you have persistent white-coat hypertension, you should consider lifestyle changes such as salt reduction and stress reduction as there is evidence that it can potentially be detrimental.\n\nIf there is considerable variability of your blood pressure and/or presence of a pulse pressure of more than 60mm Hg, you should discuss treatment with your physician as there is data to show that blood pressure variability and severe arterial stiffness are associated with adverse consequences.\n\nIf you are on medication for hypertension and you get frequent dizzy spells, especially when you get up from a lying or sitting position, it may be possible that you may have white-coat hypertension. The most important point to remember is this: ensure you do not have white-coat hypertension before you commence any treatment for elevated blood pressure.\n\nThis series is brought to you by Heart, Stroke and Cancer Centre.

Debbie Yong checks in\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 22, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nREMEMBER the last time you were in Bangkok? When you got all dressed up for a long, enjoyable evening of dinner and drinks in various nightspots, got into the car, and then headed straight into a buzz-killing hour of stand-still traffic?\n\nSuch travel woes will soon be a tale for the history books with the opening of the new Ku De Ta Bangkok. The curtains to the highly anticipated nightspot were lifted earlier this month, revealing a sprawling, 10-in-one entertainment complex within.\n\nBesides three restaurants spanning three concepts - modern Asian fine dining, Signature; casual Japanese robatayaki joint, Izakaya; and progressive Western steakhouse, Grill - the 30,000 sq ft complex further encompasses seven bars and a spacious dance floor with 10m tall ceilings to cater to Bangkok's heady swirl of pleasure-seekers.\n\n\"You can start with a drink here then head elsewhere, or stay on and have dinner at one of our restaurants before crossing over to the club or to another one of our bars if you prefer a quieter drink,\" explains managing director of Ku De Ta Bangkok Spencer Roberts - all far from the tooting horns of the infamous Bangkok jams.\n\nThough Bangkok welcomes over 22 million visitors annually, the city is still better known for its budget-friendly travel options, observes Mr Roberts, a 20-year resident of the city. This means local Thai elites, expatriates and the global jetset tend to pad around a small circuit of stiff high-end bars and fine-dining restaurants, mostly set within hotels. He elaborates: \"Even if you really like one restaurant, there is only so many times you can return to it. But with the different sections at Ku De Ta, you could come here seven days a week and have seven completely different experiences - all with stunning views mirroring what we have in Singapore.\"\n\nSimilar to its Singapore sister outlet atop the Marina Bay Sands, Ku De Ta Bangkok is perched on the 39th and 40th floors of the Sathorn Square Building in Bangkok. Glass windows all around let in 360-degree vistas of the glittering Asian metropolis by night - though far outshone, on the complex's opening evening, by the jewellery-studded arms of its high society patronage.\n\nBesides Ku De Ta, the Sathorn Square complex by Thai property developers, Golden Land, also holds a residential tower and the W Hotel Bangkok. Though no one would quite call Sathorn the throbbing heart of Bangkok's nightlife yet, the neighbourhood is gearing up for a string of high-profile openings. Ashley Sutton-designed burlesque bar Maggie Choo's opened a few streets away earlier this year, while Thailand's tallest skyscraper, the MahaNakhon, will house Dean and Deluca's Bangkok flagship, as well as the city's first Vogue Club and L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon when it opens next door in 2015. There are rumblings that recently shuttered Bed Supperclub is looking to open in the area, too.\n\n\"We don't see them as competition. The new openings will create a new lifestyle buzz in what was traditionally a financial district,\" says Michael Farquhar, corporate director of food and beverage at the Ku De Ta group.\n\n\"Singapore was our first step, and Bangkok is an indication of the future,\" he adds, of the two levels designed by New York-headquartered designers, AvroKO. A balance of shiny counter tops, dark lounge chairs and wood and stone accents keep things chic, yet comfortable. Leafy water fountains, carved stone statues and decorative 200-year-old pots crafted and shipped in straight from Bali keep the connection to the brand's initial outlet, first started on Seminyak beach in 2000.\n\nKu De Ta Singapore, too, will get a facelift next year. The restaurant will have a brand new sushi counter and new furniture, while the nightclub will be completely reconfigured and accented with more Balinese touches.\n\nThough Ku De Ta's Singapore and Bangkok outlets are owned by a separate team from Ku De Ta in Bali, \"I still call the original founders of Ku De Ta Bali every two months to ask for styling ideas,\" says Mr Farquhar. A trademark infringement suit between both parties was resolved earlier this week.\n\nWhile the menu at Ku De Ta Bali's main restaurant runs the global gamut, the food at Ku De Ta Bangkok's three restaurants bear distinct Asian leanings, thanks to an operations team combed from various modern Asian dining stalwarts. Club director Justin Dunne previously managed Bangkok's Bed SupperClub, F&B director Peter Lamb has worked at Yauatcha, Hakkasan and Zuma in London and Bangkok, while Le Bernardin-trained head chef Jonathan Maza has helped to open Nobu restaurants worldwide.\n\nFlagship 120-seater restaurant Signature serves up seamless marriages of East and West such as a Japanese sea bream with miso chowder or local tiger prawns paired with an American-leaning shiitake corn succotash, while 100-seat Izakaya's affordably priced grilled seafood and meats will complement its \"relaxed, and slightly noisy, train-station vibe\", says Mr Farquhar. Cocktails muddle Asian herbs with exotic flavours such as Danish licorice, and when ready next year, 40-seat Grill will dole out premium steaks that can be served pre-sliced to facilitate Asian-style communal dining.\n\nA 15,000 sq ft Hong Kong outpost will open across the top three floors of the California Tower in Lan Kwai Fong in mid-2014 and three to five more outlets in cities in Europe, the United States and the Middle East are currently being considered, including beach destinations, reveals Mr Farquhar.\n\nWhether you're looking over a city in its latest \"trophy building\" or taking in the sunset by the sea, picture postcard-worthy views will be the running thread at Ku De Ta. Adds Mr Roberts: \"Wherever we open, we want you to look out the window and go, 'Wow!' \"\n\nAmbitious, you remark. \"Nothing wrong with a little bit of ambition,\" he retorts. \"We're here to be a game changer.\"\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Now, the situation is reversing again.\n\nA weakening yen will help Mr Abe secure the economic growth needed to maintain his popularity at a time when other government policies, such as promoting Japan's entry into the Trans-Pacific Partnership, nuclear power policy and a controversial new official secrets Act, threaten to undermine voter support, analysts say.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

To fulfil the vision of a walkable district, Parliament Lane and the small road at Empress Place (between ACM and Victoria Theatre) will be pedestrianised permanently. This will integrate the two spaces, creating a seamless park-like setting.\n\nPart of Fullerton Road - in front of Victoria Theatre and, incidentally, part of the Formula 1 track - will also be realigned, allowing for a larger and more elegant lawn space in front of Victoria Theatre/Concert Hall and ACM.\n\nIn addition, Connaught Drive will be narrowed to one lane and limited to destination-bound traffic. Tourist coaches which currently park along Connaught Drive will be redirected to a new coach park at Marina Centre near the Marina Centre bus terminal. A new dedicated drop-off and pick-up point is planned.\n\nOther landscaping efforts, such as the planting of more trees to provide shade, better way-finding signs and upgrading of street furniture are also planned at Empress Place and Esplanade Park.\n\nIn addition, the waterfront promenade along Esplanade Park will be opened up with stepped plazas and an urban beach, allowing people to get closer to the water.\n\nVarious spaces, including Raffles Landing, will soon be equipped to host outdoor events. To facilitate this, in-built infrastructure is planned, which will allow for easier setting-up of events, pop-up structures and mobile kiosks. Night lighting will also be provided to support night activities.\n\nThese plans are part of the Urban Redevelopment Authority's (URA) PubliCity initiative, which aims to engage the community in celebrating good public spaces and to enliven public spaces through good design and programmes.\n\nIn the longer term, URA is studying the possibility of closing Anderson Bridge, Fullerton Road, St Andrew's Road and Parliament Place to through traffic, leaving it open to destination-bound traffic, public buses and pedestrians only.\n\nOther developments being studied include the temporary closure of Anderson Bridge, Fullerton Road, St Andrew's Road, and Parliament Place to traffic during weekends or evenings for events.\n\nElsewhere on the island, other upcoming enhancement projects include an environment improvement project at Bras Basah and Bugis, which will see the carriageways on a stretch along Queen Street narrowed and the sidewalks widened. More street furniture and trees are also planned, with works expected to be completed by mid-2014.\n\nPunggol Town Square and Bedok Town Centre will introduce new public spaces in Punggol and Bedok, respectively.\n\nIn addition to creating new public spaces and rejuvenating existing ones, PubliCity wants to encourage ownership of these spaces. To this end, the public is being invited to re-imagine four public spaces.\n\nSpecifically, ideas are being sought to enliven the open space beside Gedung Kuning in Kampong Glam, which measures about 1,200 square metres (sq m), and The Lawn @ Marina Bay, which measures about 13,000 sq m, as gathering spaces for the community.\n\nThe third space comprises two plots along the Singapore River Promenade - a 2,600 sq m site beside High Street Centre and a 1,000 sq m site at Clarke Quay/River Valley Road on which part of G-Max and GX-5 are currently situated. It is intended for the latter site to be transformed into an attractive entry point to Clarke Quay.\n\nThe 2,000 sq m Woodlands Civic Plaza, which is bounded by Causeway Point, Woodlands Civic Centre and two future developments, rounds up the list. The vision for the existing plaza space is a vibrant key node. Proposals should give ideas on how it can become a better public space for a diverse range of users who use the plaza for rest and respite and as a meeting place.\n\nThe submission period is from Nov 22 to Feb 14. Up to 10 winners will each win $1,000 in cash.\n\nSeparately, URA intends to launch the Pick a Bench, Pick a Place project in February next year. The public will be invited to vote for their favourite bench designs and where they would like to see the benches installed.\n\nThe benches, which are made using seating planks from the former National Stadium, are the product of a design competition held in September last year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Cheah Ui-Hoon\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 22, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE norm is to blindly buy a skincare product on the strength of its advertising or word-of-mouth recommendation, going by faith and trial-and-error. But now, one new skincare brand from Paris will eliminate that uncertainty, promising to give women and men scientific diagnoses as the basis for its recommended products. \"Ioma isn't just an ingredient story,\" summarises Jean Michel Karam, the founder and chief executive officer of the brand which touts itself as offering \"smart\" skincare.\n\n\"It's completely different from what you see on the field today, and it is revolutionising how skincare is being delivered,\" he adds. Paris-based Ioma plans to expand in Asia from Singapore.\n\nThe brand is built on its diagnostic devices, based on microelectromechanical systems (Mems). Mems are complex electronic components that can detect physical phenomena such as pressure, acceleration and speed in a particular environment. How is Mems going to revolutionise the beauty industry?\n\nFirstly by imaging and probing below the skin's surface, automatically characterising the skin and recommending personalised treatment. Based on the diagnostics, a beauty regimen is recommended. The ingredients as well as the combination of products can be customised so that the customer gets bespoke skincare. There's a focus on hydration and regeneration, and the whole idea is that not one good ingredient is good for everything, but the optimised combination of ingredients, especially when they come with the highest concentration of active ingredients. \"We have close to 10,000 different combinations based on skin needs. In Ioma, our efficacy is personalisation and that's a major trend today, as you can see in luxury and medicine,\" says Mr Karam, a scientist, inventor of more than 50 high technology patents and a serial entrepreneur. He is also the founder and CEO of MEMSCAP, a public-listed company on the NYSE Euronext stock market that ranks among the top 100 driving engines of French technology.\n\nThe Ioma Sphere device measures all the parameters of the skin and characterises it into seven major imperfections - UV damage, fine lines, firmness and wrinkles, redness, sebum, oily skin, spots and pigmentation. It then gives a score from 1 to 15 (from \"perfect\" to \"caution\") and assigns a skincode. \"A newborn's skincode is theoretically 1 but with time, our skin code gets close to 15,\" he explains. \"What you'll also see is that your skin is also different on the left and right sides of your face, because it's affected by which side gets more sun as you drive, or which side you sleep on and so on. The devices also keep track of the history of the skin.\"\n\n\"What we give to the people is the ability to understand skin better. Understanding the skin is essential, and you will understand better how to deal with it. That's why we made the commitment not to launch any point-of-sale without the devices,\" he says.\n\nDiagnosis is done at no cost to the customer, and he recommends taking the diagnosis every two to three months, because our skin changes and needs new formulas. Skin regenerates every four to six weeks, depending on genes. \"So I recommend taking a diagnosis after a month of using your first Ioma product,\" he says.\n\nIoma, launched in 2010, is a game-changer in skincare, thinks Mr Karam, and seems to be recognised as such by Unilever which has taken a share in it.\n\n\"So we now have the muscle to go into Asia in a big way.\" Besides women, the male market is an important one for Ioma, especially in Asia where men take care of their skin more than other countries. Ioma's male customers in the US comprise about 30 per cent of its clients.\n\nIoma opened at Robinson's and will next open at the end of November at Isetan Jurong East, before its third location at Isetan Scotts in January. Ioma is already distributed in over 500 points of sale in France, at Saks Fifth Avenue in the United States, and at Harrods in the UK, besides hundreds of retail points across Europe. Singapore will be the brand's first foray into Asia, and from here it will expand into at least 10 other Asian countries.\n\nuihoon@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 22, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nCOMPLIMENTARY WiFi connectivity on a travel coach may not sound like a big deal, but it can make the difference between hashtagging a picture as an #instagram versus a #latergram.\n\nAnd for those who cannot relax while on holiday, they can now send emails instead of only being able to do so when they check in to the hotel.\n\nSince Nov 1, luxury land tour operator Insight Vacations has been offering free WiFi connectivity on their coaches travelling through more than 25 European countries. The service will be extended to its North American coaches from Jan 1.\n\n\"Wifi availability is a necessity for the majority of the travellers because they want to be constantly connected,\" says Sheryl Lim, Insight Vacations regional director for Asia.\n\nWiFi connectivity on the go is just one of the many ways that travel companies are tapping technology to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nPrime Touch and Feel, the online arm of Prime Travel & Tour recently launched two new online services that aim to make travelling abroad much easier.\n\nThe first is the Prime Smart Voyager, a mobile app that functions as a virtual tour guide. Maps, points of interest in a city and the travel itinerary are downloaded onto the app before leaving Singapore. The content is only made available to clients who have booked a tour with the agency, and it will only last the duration of the trip.\n\nAt the destination, a click on the agenda buttons shows the day's list of things to do, with tips on useful local phrases and suggestions on what foods to try.\n\nUsing the app's offline maps, visitors can tour the city on their own, and at each point of interest, a video will pop up explaining more about the spot. With the app, travellers no longer have to lug a physical guide book around.\n\n\"A city may have over 200 points of interest, so the visitor can pick which ones they want to visit,\" says Buck Low, chief executive of Prime Touch and Feel.\n\nThe app also comes with a \"Take Me Back\" function which allows the user to return to a pre-determined location, with directions provided.\n\nThe company introduced its Prime Dream Holiday Builder, where users can create their own holidays with a few mouse clicks. Templates to different destinations have been created, but users can tag on additional nights at a certain location if they wish, or change accommodation accordingly. The site uses real-time pricing, so users instantly know how much they will be paying.\n\n\"It can be a time-consuming process if you book a holiday in 10 different cities. So we have made it easier with this customised tour planning and booking engine,\" says Mr Low.\n\nSince their launch in August, Mr Low says about 80 people have used the Smart Voyager and about 150 people have \"fiddled\" with the Dream Holiday Builder.\n\nHe notes that there has been an increase in the number of people who book their holidays online, compared to going to a travel agent, and that number will rise. \"We want to have a head start by offering these two services,\" he says.\n\nAlso jumping on the technology bandwagon is Singapore Attractions Express (SAEx) which launched its Virtual Tour Guide System (VTGS) earlier this week. SAEx is the largest network of express bus services that connects major attractions in Singapore.\n\nThe VTGS can be found on the company's buses, and uses GPS to trigger pre-recorded videos at certain locations. For example, when it passes by Chinatown, a short video clip of the area will be played. Bus Hub managing director V Anilan says the system works as a tour guide's assistant. \"It does not replace the tour guide,\" he adds. Bus Hub operates SAEx.\n\nMr Anilan adds VTGS works well for tourists on unguided bus tours, and can be implemented in rental cars as well.\n\nOnline travel agency Zuji which has been operating since 2002, recently relaunched its website, but the changes are more than just about aesthetics. New features on the site include a live chat function where users can easily talk to the customer service officers. Chua Hui Wan, Zuji Singapore's CEO says that these features are important to have as online travel agencies often lack the \"people factor that traditional travel agents offer\". Traffic to the website peaks at night, so instead of having customer support service from the previous 8am to 8pm duration, Zuji will now offer 24/7 support.\n\nTravel partners who have already been offering services online are not resting on their laurels.\n\nAndreas Behrens, TripAdvisor's director of mobile partnerships APAC says that more than one-third of traffic to the site comes from a tablet or smartphone device. \"Travel is an inherently on-the-go experience, and we want people to get the most out of our resources on any device, anywhere. Over 69 million people have installed our various apps, and we see that travellers are using them not only for planning but during their trips.\" Some of the features in its newly designed tablet app include the ability to see everything surrounding a specific point of interest and new city pages to explore all the best things to do.\n\nDesign Hotels is also relaunching a new look for its website. Instead of merely listing hotels and booking options, the new site will include \"not to miss\" events in destinations, insider information from hoteliers and local heroes, and an easier booking process.\n\nTechnology may be changing the way people travel, but travel agents have ways to keep up with the competition.\n\nThe majority of people who go to travel agents are still looking for package tours. Jane Chang, Chan Brothers Travel's marketing communications manager says, \"package tours will never be the sunset industry\".\n\nShe adds that travel agencies are better connected, possess a wealth of knowledge that customers might attain only a fraction of, even if they spend weeks combing and researching the Internet, offer time-tested itineraries and provide 24-hour overseas emergency assistance.\"\n\n\"We keep packages interesting so that people will be drawn to them and always bring new experiences to customers,\" she says.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

On Dec 9, 1933, the inaugural flight to Singapore from London on then Imperial Airways took about 10 days as it departed from Croydon in south London and travelled via Paris, Italian city Brindisi, Alexandria, Cairo and Karachi. A one-way fare to Singapore cost \u00a3180 (S$362) at the time.

For the week, the index lost 29 points or 0.9 per cent.\n\nDearth of liquidity has been a major problem for several weeks now and yesterday was no exception with a feeble 1.2 billion units worth $772 million being traded. Excluding warrants, there were 185 rises versus 188 falls.\n\nRetail brokers reported little or no interest from their clients, in blue chips or penny stocks. \"It's deathly quiet in our dealing room,\" said one trading representative. \"This is the worst the market's been in many years.\"\n\nStill, there were a few bright spots. Keppel Corp, for example, has been strong lately and gained 5 cents at $11.16 yesterday with 3.5 million traded.\n\nKeppel is JP Morgan's (JPM's) best \"overweight\" pick for 2014 because of strong order momentum, better margins and orders from its new Mexico yard.\n\n\"Our Dec 2014 target of $13.30 is based on a sum-of-the-parts, which uses discounted cash flow to value the rig-building business, 12x earnings for ship repair, property at nett asset value, Keppel Land at our price target and infrastructure at 1.5x book,\" said JPM.\n\nCIMB set an identical price target and recommended clients buy ahead of Keppel's gathering order momentum.\n\n\"The stock could potentially trade up to +1 standard deviation above its 5-year mean of 18x P/E (price/earnings) or 3.3x P/BV (price/book value) if its order momentum reverts to its 2005-07 levels of $7 billion per annum in our view,\" said CIMB.\n\nElsewhere, Golden Agri Resources (GAR) yesterday added half a cent at 58.5 cents with 24.7 million traded. OCBC Investment Research, however, yesterday noted GAR's disappointing results but conceded that as the market appears to be taking on a more \"risk on\" approach, a higher valuation is perhaps justified. Even so, this only results in GAR's fair value rising from 46.5 cents to 50 cents, which means the broker is maintaining its \"sell\" rating.\n\nOne main reason for the market's current paralysis is an outflow of liquidity due to worries over when the US Federal Reserve will start tapering its US$85 billion per month asset purchases. Most observers expect this to start in March next year.\n\nOn Thursday, the president of the Richmond Fed, Jeffrey Lacker, said it would be appropriate for the Fed to start scaling back its asset purchases between December and March.\n\nIn response, Rabobank said that while Mr Lacker is known as a hawk and is currently a non-voting member of the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC), his statement adds to the theme of Wednesday's FOMC minutes that while the timing of tapering remains uncertain, it is certainly on its way.\n\nDBS Group Research, however, is sceptical of the benefits of QE, stating in its Wednesday Daily Breakfast Spread that QE hasn't been very \"explosive\" to begin with.\n\n\"It hasn't kicked up demand growth and, therefore, it hasn't kicked up inflation,\" said DBS. \"Consumption growth has been falling for three years and is now at a 3.5 year low. Business investment growth has averaged 0.6 per cent ... over the past three quarters - practically zero ... One can only conclude that QE hasn't done much good, nor much harm. It hasn't done much of anything.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They will add 26 new gates and expand cargo storage at the airport.\n\nCCR and partners Flughafen Zuerich AG and Flughafen Munchen will add a new terminal and landing strip at Confins airport on the outskirts of Belo Horizonte - Brazil's third-biggest metropolitan area, with over five million residents.\n\nAirports have been the most appealing part of President Dilma Rousseff's plan to privatise some 200 billion reais of infrastructure projects, breathing new life into Brazil's clogged roads and ports.\n\nThe latest concessions follow a hotly contested auction in February 2012 that awarded rights to major airports in Sao Paulo and Brasilia for 24.5 billion reais.

This, especially when today's advantaged feedstock, like shale, becomes commonplace or more costly in future.\n\nWith the feedstock landscape always shifting - due to trends and innovations not just in petrochemicals, but in the upstream and refining sectors - chemical companies like ExxonMobil will require sustained innovation in feedstock, manufacturing processes and products if they want to build competitive advantage, he stressed.\n\nCiting an example, he said ExxonMobil's Rotterdam aromatics plant has been designed to get feedstock from nine of its refineries and chemical plants, with the pooling of feedstock supply and advanced technology enabling the facility to become the largest and most profitable there.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

You have the money, you buy the real estate, you Reit it, you exit,\" she said in a recent interview. \"We have not seen this done in Asia before. There's a market for it.\"\n\nPlans for the funds come as cross-border property transactions in the Asia-Pacific region climbed 5.5 per cent in the third quarter to US$5.2 billion, according to CBRE Research.\n\nCommercial real estate transactions in the region rose 11 per cent to US$21.6 billion from the June quarter, the property brokerage said.\n\nReits have raised US$2.7 billion through initial public offerings in Singapore, about a third of all Reit IPOs in the Asia-Pacific this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nMapletree Greater China Commercial Trust, which raised US$1.4 billion in its February IPO, was the second-biggest fundraiser in the Asia-Pacific this year after the Nomura Reit in Japan.\n\nMeanwhile, Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman is stepping up real estate investment in Asia, tapping the market for US$4 billion for Blackstone's maiden property fund focused on the region. Blackstone, which has been among the biggest buyers of property in Australia and India, is seeking more investment in China as rising income and urbanisation drive demand.\n\nUnder the agreement with ARA, Singapore-based Straits Trading will buy a 20.1 per cent stake in the trust manager for $294.4 million in cash and shares from Mr Li's Cheung Kong Investment Co and Mr Lim. The transaction will make Straits Trading the biggest shareholder of ARA.\n\nThe Blackstone-style funds will be created through the new company formed with Mr Lim, and the venture will have capital commitment of as much as $950 million, according to the announcement last month.\n\nStraits Trading, a landlord in Singapore's financial district, has real estate assets worth $830 million, Ms Chew said.\n\n\"The key will be on execution,\" Terence Khi at UOB Kay Hian Pte said. \"ARA's focus is shifting away from launching new Reits towards private funds due to the impact of tapering and increased competition.\"\n\nThe creation of new Reits comes as the number of retirees increases in the region, boosting demand for investments that offer a stable dividend.\n\nThe number of people who will exceed 60 years old will reach 463.1 million by 2017, up from 391.3 million last year, according to data compiled by Ageing Asia Pte.\n\n\"Logically, there should be a demand for Reits in Asia,\" Ms Chew said. \"We have an ageing population and Reits are a very steady form of income.\"\n\nThe joint venture is still deciding on where the new properties will be located. Other than Singapore, the funds may seek investments in properties in Europe, Malaysia and Australia, Ms Chew said.\n\nUnder the agreement with ARA, Straits Trading's investment property portfolio will be managed as a separate account, according to the statement.\n\nStraits Trading shares have fallen 2.7 per cent this year, compared with the 8 per cent slump in the measure tracking property stocks in Singapore.\n\nThe company had cash proceeds of $508.8 million after accepting United Engineers Ltd's higher offer for its 44.58 per cent stake in WBL Corp, giving Straits Trading more access to capital for its property funds.\n\n\"What we're trying to do is create a whole ecosystem and a platform for monetizing real estate,\" Ms Chew said. \"The environment is in our favour.\" Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price in debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:21 PM\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nJane Street deposits US$567 million so it can resume India trading\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:48 PM\n\nBank of Japan is said likely to consider raising inflation forecast\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLG Electronics shares jump on report of AI chip gear development\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:27 AM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM", "images": []}

She will step down at year-end, but filling her shoes is such a gargantuan task that two people will take over her portfolio.\n\nMs Yeo, 64, will retire when the new year arrives, but will retain a role as special adviser to SGX. Replacing her as chief regulatory officer will be current deputy chief regulatory officer Richard Teng. The chief risk officer hat will be donned by Agnes Koh, who is currently head of clearing risk. Like Ms Yeo, Mr Teng and Ms Koh held positions at the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) before joining SGX.\n\n\"Lian Sim has built SGX's risk management and regulatory function into a well-respected, professional organisation with a worldwide reputation for expertise and execution,\" SGX chief executive Magnus Bocker said in a statement yesterday.\n\n\"She has been tireless in her pursuit of regulating a fair, orderly and transparent marketplace. We thank her for her invaluable contribution and send with her our very best wishes for a long and happy retirement.\"\n\nMs Yeo joined the exchange in July 2004 after an illustrious career at MAS and Temasek Holdings. She replaced Alan Shaw, who was one of the architects behind SGX's migration towards a disclosure-based regime.\n\nMs Yeo's legacy includes the creation of the sponsor-supervised regime for the Catalist board, as well as leading SGX to become one of the first exchanges in the world to meet post-global financial crisis international standards on clearing and risk management for exchanges.\n\nNotably, she helped to steer the exchange through the global financial crisis. SGX's ability to quickly resolve and clear the debris from MF Global's 2011 collapse has drawn praise.\n\nSome of her views have evolved over time. For the first several years of her time at SGX, she had resisted calls for circuit breakers in the market, arguing that the existing mechanisms were enough.\n\nBut as markets have become more complex, and with the possibility of high-frequency trading on the horizon, SGX is now laying some of the final pieces for a circuit-breaker system.\n\nOn her watch, SGX has also had to grapple with a number of corporate governance lapses among China-based companies that have tested the limits of the exchange's powers.\n\nMs Yeo sought to find a delicate balance as a regulator, saying in 2007 that \"intervention with a heavy hand does not add to effective regulation\".\n\nBut she has also been acutely aware of the importance of enforcement, through which regulators try to translate their ideals into reality.\n\n\"This is where regulators come in, to put flesh on the bones,\" she had said in 2007.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/more-buyers-more-galleries", "site_title": "More buyers, more galleries", "publish_date": null, "content": "More buyers, more galleries\n\nWith local art lovers snapping up pieces in greater numbers, even high-end dealers are jumping onboard AAF. HELMI YUSOF reports\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Nov 21, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIF AFFORDABLE Art Fair statistics are right, Singaporeans are the hungriest art buyers in the world - at least for lower- end art.\n\nThe fair, which takes place in 15 cities, found that 1 out of 2.5 visitors to the Singapore fair buys a piece of art. That ratio is the highest in the world - the second highest being its London fair figure, where 1 out of 4 visitors buys an artwork.\n\nAAF Singapore, which sells art priced from $100 to $10,000, has grown substantially since its humble beginnings in 2010. Then, there were 50 galleries; this year, there are 95. The fair also expects to hit $4.5 million in sales this year - up from 2010's $1.75 million, 2011's $3 million and 2012's $4 million.\n\nAAF director of development and global partnerships Paul Matthews says: \"In some countries, the concept of the Affordable Art Fair had been a little slow to take off. In Singapore, it took off almost instantly. People here just got it, and wanted to buy art.\"\n\nNext year, AAF Singapore is expanding to hold two fairs - one in May and the other in November. According to fair director Camilla Hewitson, AAF has compared its data across the board, taking into account local differentiators, and found the expansion viable.\n\nIndeed, there are only two other cities where Affordable Art Fairs holds two fairs annually at the same venue: London and New York, the art epicentres of the world.\n\nAnd though most art observers would agree that Singapore's art scene cannot compare with that of London or New York, its low-end art consumption certainly rivals theirs.\n\n\"There's definitely a great hunger for art here, and people do have some money,\" says Mr Matthews. \"But the other thing to note is that Singapore is tremendously multicultural; our gallerists are constantly telling us how they've sold works by the same artist to buyers as diverse as French, Malaysian, South American and, of course, Singaporean. It's very heterogeneous - unlike in some places.\"\n\nTypical of AAF Singapore, though, most of the artworks tend to be brightly coloured and decorative - perhaps even more so in this year's edition than the last. One has to walk through a lot of pleasant-looking figurative works before finding the strong statement pieces that challenge perspectives. Bold, conceptual works and good abstract pieces are rare.\n\nMs Hewitson says: \"We do advise our gallerists on what might work better in this market. Paintings and photography do well here. Large-scale works that measure, say, 2m by 2m are not likely to be bought because of the apartment sizes here. There's not a lot of sculptures - but there are some galleries bringing that in this year to test the market. And there are very few conceptual works.\"\n\nForging new relationships\n\nTwo surprising additions to this year's gallery list are Mizuma Gallery and Space Cottonseed - two galleries from the high-end gallery cluster Gillman Barracks. Opened last September, Gillman Barracks has unfortunately seen low footfall and weak sales, prompting the two galleries to participate in AAF Singapore.\n\nSpace Cottonseed owner Janice Kim says: \"I came here because I want to meet more art buyers and forge new relationships... I was here last year, and the place was very much active and alive, compared to Gillman Barracks which is sort of quiet. . . . Of course, I had to select artworks that are priced below the $10,000 cap, so I've included some of my good artists, but choosing their works that are lower- priced.\"\n\nMr Matthews says there were initially eight galleries from Gillman Barracks that wanted to take part in AAF. But at the last minute, six got \"cold feet\" - presumably because they brand themselves higher on the art- buying spectrum than AAF.\n\n\"Still, we're proud we have another part of the market we haven't had at the fair before,\" says Mr Matthews. This year, the fair expects to attract 17,000 visitors - up from last year's 16,000.\n\nOther galleries making their debut this year include London-based Manifold Editions and online store Eyestorm. They sell limited-edition prints by top and emerging artists respectively.\n\nManifold Editions has brought prints by art giants like Marc Quinn, Chris Ofili, Damien Hirst and Anish Kapoor, all under $10,000. Among the good buys may be its Quinn prints of his sculpture of Kate Moss in a yoga pose, retailing at $2,750, as well as Hirst's dot paintings going for $4,200 to $9,500. Meanwhile, Eyestorm has brought works by its bestselling emerging artists, including Jacky Tsai, Noma Barr and Lucie Bennett.\n\nInvesting in the future\n\nAAF's sterling numbers have not just attracted the higher-end galleries. DBS Bank, which brands itself as \"the people's bank\", has also jumped onboard to be the lead sponsor of the event for the first time.\n\nKoh Kar Siong, regional head of DBS Treasures and Treasures Private Client, says: \"In recent years, we have seen an increasing interest in the arts and culture among our clients. As part of DBS's commitment to be a leading wealth manager in Asia, we are always looking for unique sponsorship platforms that aim to engage, enrich and educate.\"\n\nAnd while, arguably, very little art found in AAF would count as \"investment art\" (that is, art that is likely to appreciate in value), AAF has been generous in investing in its collectors and the future stars of art. It continues to feature various talks on collecting, as well as a booth for the Young Talent Programmes, featuring promising young Singaporean artists including Hilmi Johandi and Lennard Ong.\n\nSays Mr Matthews: \"Some 30 per cent of the buyers at all our fairs are first-time buyers - in that they've never bought a single art piece in their lives. We're not competing with the higher-end Art Stage; we just want to create a friendly environment where people don't feel intimidated by art.\"\n\nhelmi@sph.com.sg\n\nThe Affordable Art Fair is now on till Sunday, at the F1 Pit Building.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And was it to a parent, a partner, or perhaps a pet?\n\nBecause there are so many different types of love, with very different ways to express each of them, SingTheatre plans to delve into the theme of love, and its multiple layers with its latest production.\n\nThe show is titled A French Kiss in Singapore, and it is a musical revue that includes dance, music and sketches, all revolving around the music of four of the biggest names in French music - Charles Aznavour, Serge Gainsbourg, Jacques Brel and Charles Trenet. It will run from next week till Dec 7 at the drama theatre of the School of the Arts.\n\n\"When these French writers write songs, every song tells a story. And they write it from observing daily life. So if they write about love, it's not just about romantic love. It could be love between a son and his dying mother, it could be love of a soldier thinking about home,\" explains director and choreographer George Chan, who is one of the four actors in the all-male cast.\n\nAdds his co-star, local theatre veteran Hossan Leong: \"Also, I think we're realising while singing and rehearsing these songs, that it's not your Lady Gaga style of repeat, repeat. Oh my goodness, every verse is different, every refrain has a different lyric. So there's no repeat, no going back to chorus.\"\n\nTaking the stage also in this production are acclaimed local actor Robin Goh, and Australian actor Linden Furnell, who earlier this year starred in Pangdemonium's hit musical Next To Normal. Between them, they will be singing 23 songs, but only two and a half (the cast declined to reveal the \"half\" song; preferring to keep it a surprise for the audience) will be in French.\n\nAnd though the names of these French singers may sound foreign at first, the English titles of their songs will probably ring a few bells. For example, Trenet's song La Mer (The Sea) is actually the Bobby Darin classic Beyond The Sea.\n\nAlso, in 1961, Belgian singer-songwriter Brel wrote Le Moribond (The Dying Man), which was later translated and became an English pop hit Seasons in the Sun. It was first made famous by Canadian singer Terry Jacks in the seventies before Irish boyband Westlife remade it over two decades later.\n\n\"A lot of these songs, when we sing them, they are in English; so we are all singing them without realising they were originally written in French ... We want to reach out to the Singaporean community especially to those who don't speak French, and tell them, 'hey, French culture is not just about baguettes, berets and red wine, there's a lot more than that,\" Leong chuckles.\n\nA French Kiss in Singapore runs from Nov 27 to Dec 7, at the Sota Drama Theatre at 8pm from Tues to Sun, with an additional 4pm matinee on weekends.

Such workers enjoyed an average wage increase of 3.1 per cent in the year they were trained, reinforcing the belief that training enhances low-wage workers' productivity levels, which in turn results in higher pay.\n\nIn its study of 6,000 Singaporean low-wage workers tracked over three years from 2007 to 2009, MTI found that this \"positive causal return\" to training occurred on top of year-to-year increments that other workers who did not participate in training experienced.\n\n\"As such, the results provide evidence of positive returns to training, and re-affirm the importance of skills upgrading for low-wage workers,\" said MTI economist Lee Zen Wea, who authored the study.\n\nEven after restricting the sample to workers with no formal education, the returns to training still remained positive and statistically significant - albeit lower at 2.4 per cent - indicating that less-educated workers stand to benefit from structured training as well.\n\nThe study showed that workers with little or no formal education and those in less-skilled occupations - such as cleaners and labourers - were less likely to participate in training.\n\n\"(The results) suggest that among low-wage workers, access to training opportunities can vary . . . Policymakers may thus wish to focus their attention on these groups of low-wage workers,\" said Mr Lee.\n\nThe study also found that workers with union memberships were 12 per cent more likely to attend training than their non-unionised peers. This could be because unionised industries are likely to have roles that are more structured, and therefore have specific training courses catered to them.\n\nUnions may also increase the bargaining power of low-wage workers, institutionalise training plans for them and raise the awareness of training opportunities among its members. \"As such, more efforts to reach out to non-unionised low-wage workers to encourage them to participate in training can also be explored,\" Mr Lee said.\n\nHe believes that there is scope for more research to assess the types of training that would benefit low-wage workers the most, and studies that examine such workers' post-training wage profile over a longer time period.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the past few months, health food eateries specialising in everything from organic produce to raw diets and gluten-free menus have started making in-roads into more visible shopping mall locations. A clutch are also spinning off fast-food concepts to reach out to a wider audience.\n\nAshikin Raja of Frootkeyk, a baking collective that churns out healthy cakes using organic ingredients such as raw food, rice milk and superfoods like chia seeds and spirulina, has noticed a significant turn in their 11 months of operations.\n\n\"More parents are asking to customise their children's birthday cakes to include healthier or organic food, and we get requests for gluten-free bakes from people who don't suffer from coeliac disease,\" she adds.\n\nInstead of riding on the current food fad, young entrepreneurs Agnetta Lew, 23, and fiance Gabriel Lee, 24, decided to eschew opening yet another cupcake shop for a more challenging alternative: in July, they opened Singapore's first entirely gluten-free bakery, Jonathan's, to cater to what they feel is a gap in the market.\n\nMs Lew, whose younger brother Jonathan has Down's Syndrome and is on a gluten-free diet, says she started the cafe to offer special needs children and those with severe allergies a place where \"like other kids, they too can order anything and everything on the menu\".\n\nUnless personally afflicted with a food allergy, says Ms Lew, most chefs don't realise the severity of such health conditions, and the need to strictly control cross-contamination, says Ms Lew, hence her decision to go fully gluten-free, despite the very niche target market. \"The upside of having a customer base with specific needs also means that you tend to get more loyal customers, and better word-of-mouth marketing within that community,\" adds her business partner, Mr Lee.\n\nSimilarly, consultant chef Tim Ross-Watson, who is gluten-intolerant, worked in a 55 per cent gluten-free menu at Gusto when the Italian restaurant at Ion Orchard approached him to reboot their menu. His business partner, Audrey Yeong, who runs food consultancy, Apple Order, and is on a voluntary Paleo diet - an eating regime that eliminates all processed forms of sugar on certain days of the week - attributes the growing demand for allergen-free dining to the proliferation of fitness and fad diets.\n\nAllergy sufferers, for instance, may not realise they have existing allergies until they go on a fitness regime that requires the elimination of specific food groups, and then notice a significant improvement in their health. They may then decide to get tested, and identify pre-existing allergies. \"And when they start to see results through eating better, they won't want to go back to their regular eating habits,\" she says.\n\n\"People are awakening to the fact that pharmaceutical drugs are just suppressing the symptoms rather than treating the problem - and they usually come with side effects,\" observes Ashley Heather of the Living Cafe and Deli in Bukit Timah. Rather than try to suppress the growing appetite for fast food given in an increasingly time-starved society, businesses such as his have decided to adjust their concepts to keep up with the shift towards convenience food.\n\nLast month, the cafe rebranded itself as the Living Cafe and Deli to better spotlight its retail section and expanded menu of grab-and-go items such as healthy sandwiches, salads, wraps and dehydrated crackers. \"It used to be a given that fast food was unhealthy, processed food, but these days, people want fast food that is also healthy. We are evolving with the dynamic,\" Mr Heather adds, citing the global boom in raw food express outlets.\n\nVegan burger joint, Greenzilla, likewise, expanded from a stall in a Jurong East coffeeshop to a four-seat, largely takeaway kiosk in The Star Vista mall in September, while SuperNature recently relocated from its Park House to a more visible space in Forum the Shopping Mall to boost its walk-in traffic. It set aside a prominent corner in the store for a new takeaway concept, the SuperNature To-Go Cafe.\n\nThe ready meals help to dispel the common perception among sceptics that healthier food is less tasty and offers poorer value for money, according to its spokesman. \"Ready-made food allows customers to taste the organic produce available in our store, and we believe that tasting is believing. When customers sample our food, they can truly taste the freshness and difference that organic produce offers.\" If the takeaway counter is well-received, the corner may eventually be expanded into a full-fledged, sit-down cafe.\n\nTo keep prices down, the store's buyers also source free-range and natural products from countries around the region such as Taiwan and Thailand, rather than limit themselves to products from Europe and the United States, which tend to have higher import costs.\n\nBut business owners such as Frootkeyk's Ms Raja also believe critical change comes about not just from boosting the number of speciality health food restaurants in Singapore, but in getting more regular food outlets to offer healthier alternatives too.\n\n\"As it is, we see bubble tea shops allowing for sugar level choice and hawker stalls promoting healthier options,\" she adds.\n\nStill, there's a stickier challenge that plagues not just health food eateries, but every F&B business in Singapore: the issue of simply surviving in an increasingly competitive environment. According to the latest statistics, a total of 537 restaurants closed in Singapore last year.\n\nCiting high rents and tightened foreign labour laws, Living Cafe and Deli's Mr Heather rules out further expansion in Singapore, citing instead opportunities in neighbouring cities such as Jakarta, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur instead.\n\n\"Running an F&B outlet in Singapore is just too hard,\" he says.\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And the designers behind both companies had travelled to Paris, part of a nine-brand contingent, thanks to the taxpayers of Singapore.\n\nFor the last three years, the Textile & Fashion Federation (Singapore), a non-profit trade body, has been aggressively promoting fashion and design in the city-state by sending designers and their wares to industry trade shows and organising special promotional events of their own.\n\n\"If it were not for Singapore, I would not be here,\" said Georgine Ratelband, 24, whose Georgine label is incorporated in Singapore but who maintains a design studio in New York.\n\nThe contingent included jewellery designers showing at the Premi\u00e8re Classe tent in the Jardin des Tuileries. Jeweller Yuki Mitsuyasu, who trained at Central Saint Martins and is from Singapore, showed a visitor a necklace that flowed through her fingers like a stream, which she said was her inspiration for the piece. And bold, Jackson Pollock-inspired rings were displayed by Carolyn Kan, winner of the 2010 Elle jewellery designer of the year award in Singapore.\n\nThe federation underwrites designers' travel expenses and show fees with a grant from a programme operated by International Enterprise Singapore, a governmental agency promoting overseas business.\n\nCallia Chua, the federation's group director, said the first group was sent to a Paris event in 2010 and, since then, others have attended trade shows such as the Expo Riva Schuh, a footwear show at Lake Garda in Italy.\n\nFrank Bober, founder and chief executive of the online trend forecaster Stylesight, says such international exposure is a good idea. \"There is not much awareness of Singapore designers on the world stage, but everyone has to start somewhere,\" he said. \"It's nice to hear that there is support for the Singapore industry.\"\n\nA key port in centuries past, and particularly favoured by ships that could not travel between India and China without a stop, Singapore today is the second-largest hub for textile and apparel business and sourcing in the Asia-Pacific region, following Hong Kong, Ms Chua said. The total apparel trade is valued at S$4.4 billion, or US$3.5 billion, a year.\n\nFashion is a relatively recent addition.\n\n\"The fashion industry has evolved from a manufacturing-based industry sometime in the 1980s, and continues to be an integral part of our economic landscape,\" Ms Chua said.\n\nGovernmental support for fashion expansion is not unique to Singapore.\n\nFor example, the Korea Fashion Association, an organisation introduced by the South Korean government in 1985 to promote fashion, has organised a variety of international showcases, and has been credited with introducing labels such as Ugiz and Culture Call.\n\nSome industry specialists say such programmes are good but could be better focused on the designers rather than the country or government.\n\n\"Financial support from governments to show collections overseas always benefits designers,\" said Fern Mallis, an industry consultant and the former executive director of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. \"But when a group of designers are promoted under a banner like 'Singapore Designer', no designer name recognition is registered. It would be better if these government initiatives promoted the designer with a small credit.\n\n\"For example: 'With support from the Singapore Fashion Federation'. Then the fashion industry would be responding to a specific designer and not a group show.\"\n\nOne of the recent Singapore-organised trips was to South Korea, where the designers participated in a group show during Seoul Fashion Week and stocked a pop-up store at the Galleria department store in the capital.\n\n\"Koreans are now hungry for something fresh,\" said Ms Kan, who also went on this trip. \"It was a success in terms of sales and awareness, with local TV and international magazines.\"\n\nShe said her company, Carrie K, received orders from Cara & Co, a concept store in Sydney, as well as interest from buyers from South Korea, Europe and the Middle East.\n\nShe also was surprised by Instagram fans. \"They found out that I was here.\"\n\nAnother beneficiary was Rayson Tan, the designer behind the lifestyle and fashion brand L'ile Aux Ashby. \"I made new contacts, took orders and got good international awareness,\" said Mr Tan, whose clients include Taiwan pop star Jolin Tsai.\n\nMs Kan said the Singapore federation helped find people in Seoul to produce the runway show, including getting sponsorships for the hair and makeup services; initiated and managed the pop-up store at the Galleria; and set up a private showroom and marketing for the designers.\n\nDesigners who want to qualify for funding must be incorporated or registered and based in Singapore, Ms Chua said. In addition, their businesses must complete three of six operations in the city-state, including such categories as market development and planning; manufacturing and other activities; logistics and shipping management.\n\nThe programmes, which have included 36 designers or brands in five shows this year, are growing in popularity.\n\n\"Last year, there was a lot more interest,\" Doreen Tan, the federation's chief executive, said in a telephone interview. \"Designers realised that they get both publicity and confirmed orders.\"\n\nBuyers also have kind words for such programmes.\n\n\"Our main goal is to search for new talent,\" said Averyl Oates, fashion director for the department stores division of the Groupe Galeries Lafayette, in Paris. \"This is not easy when buyers do not travel as much due to travel and budget constraints.\n\n\"Supporting and investing in Singaporean or any foreign designer is beneficial for all parties, both to help emerging and young designers establish themselves in a very competitive environment, as well as in creating and incubating global talent, across luxury and couture, with well-known designers such as Andrew Gn to more mass market contemporary names, such as All Dressed Up,\" Ms Oates said, referring to two Singapore labels.\n\n\"Most young designers do not have the funds, distribution support, or know-how to establish themselves abroad, which Singapore could help with if they took a stand at foreign trade shows.\"\n\nThe next fashion mission is planned for February, when designers will travel to the women's ready-to-wear trade show Coterie, in New York.\n\nHeliopolis, an accessories business founded in Singapore in 1990, plans to introduce its Sunset Glam collection at the event.

These were lowered to 0-1 per cent and 2-3 per cent respectively in August.\n\nSticking to the 0-1 per cent growth forecast will mean an average growth rate of 33.5 to 40 per cent in the final two months of the year, UOB Bank economist Francis Tan estimated, which is highly unlikely.\n\nUOB reckoned that NODX was more likely to slip 3 per cent this year, which Mr Tan felt was still on the optimistic side because it suggested an average 14 per cent year-on-year rise in November-December.\n\nDespite the downward adjustments in the full-year trade numbers, the government trade promotion agency said yesterday that it expected both NODX and total trade to grow 1-3 per cent next year, in line with stronger global economic growth.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected that the global economy will grow 3.6 per cent next year, up from 2.9 per cent in 2013.\n\nIE Singapore is mindful that uncertainties remain in 2014. It pointed out that the eurozone recovery is likely to be weak while US economic growth will be moderate.\n\nMost Asian economies are projected to grow slightly faster, but China looks like it will grow slower than in 2013.\n\nThe latest revised forecasts came after NODX and total trade fell 7.1 and 1.8 per cent respectively in the first nine months of the year. But the year-on-year contraction in total trade in Q2 - it fell 2 per cent - has swung to 6 per cent growth in Q3.\n\n\"The level of total trade reached $254 billion in Q3, higher than the previous quarter's $246 billion,\" IE Singapore said.\n\nNODX's on-year quarterly decline has also started to ease, pointing to a pick-up in the last quarter of this year.\n\nNODX fell 3.3 per cent year-on-year in Q3, after tumbling 5.2 per cent in Q2 - as a result of lower shipments in both electronic and non-electronic NODX.\n\nShipments to all of Singapore's major markets fell in Q3, except China, the United States, Hong Kong and Thailand.\n\nThe biggest contributors to NODX's decline in Q3 were the European Union (-29.1 per cent), South Korea (-33.4 per cent) and Taiwan (-13.3 per cent), said IE Singapore.\n\nElectronic NODX fell 8.7 per cent in Q3, a smaller fall than the 11.5 per cent decline in Q2. Domestic shipments of integrated circuits, parts of PCs and disk media products continued to drop.\n\nLed by lower domestic exports of pharmaceuticals, specialised machinery and aromatic chemicals, non-electronic NODX dipped 0.6 per cent. It fell by a larger 1.9 per cent in Q2.\n\nLooking at October's NODX, which posted year-on-year growth of 2.8 per cent, the first positive reading since January, Barclay's Joey Chew concluded: \"It (NODX) has emerged from a long slumber.\"\n\nBut CIMB's Song Seng Wun felt that it was too early to say that a decisive turnaround had taken place.\n\nStill, most private sector economists have become more upbeat, predicting that full-year economic growth would exceed 3.5 per cent.\n\nNon-oil re-exports (NORX), the only bright spot among the gloomy trade numbers so far, jumped 7.6 per cent in the January-September period.\n\nThanks to the rise in both electronic and non-electronic re-exports, NORX jumped 11.7 per cent in Q3, after a 12.2 per cent increase in Q2.\n\nApart from Indonesia, NORX to the rest of the major markets rose in Q3. The three biggest contributors to the increase were China (31.5 per cent), South Korea (53.9 per cent) and the US (30.3 per cent).\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So you still need to top up at night by buying from the grid at full rate. But current regulations make that a very difficult proposition.\"\n\nThe Energy Market Authority (EMA) has announced various measures to promote the use of intermittent energy sources, such as nearly doubling the cap for power generation from such sources to 600 MW from 350 MW. Last month, S Iswaran, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, launched a consultation paper on proposed changes to rules governing such sources.\n\nThese and other measures are expected to help enable renewable energy sources (without the aid of government subsidies) meet 8 per cent of Singapore's electricity needs by 2025, up from less than one per cent now. This, in turn, will support its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to between 7 and 11 per cent below business as usual (BAU) levels by 2020.\n\n\"The SEAS White Paper is based in part on discussions with EMA,\" said Mr Inglin. \"Until recently, most renewable energy is not commercially viable without subsidies. So government said we will testbed you. Now the key message is you don't need the subsidy because you can compete with conventional electricity (sources). All we need now is a level playing field and fair access to the grid.\"\n\nDispelling perceptions that renewable energy is expensive, SEAS chairman Edwin Khew noted that solar prices have \"gone below grid parity\" in the past two years due to raw material cost reductions. The levelised cost of energy (or the cost per unit of electricity) for solar photovoltaics (PV) electricity is about 15 cents per kilowatt hour, and that of biomass is 19 cents per kilowatt hour, while current retail electricity tariffs are about 26 cents per kilowatt hour.\n\nThe ability to unlock up to $4 billion worth of potential investment from the private sector will depend on the removal of regulatory, commercial and technical barriers to adoption of such sources, Mr Inglin said.\n\nWhile there are restrictions on feeding renewable energy directly into the grid, EMA is looking at simplifying grid connections for small (1-10 MW) renewable energy plants, and allowing large commercial customers to sell excess green energy to the grid, he said.\n\nSingapore is behind the curve in terms of dealing with its waste, said Stephen Peters, director of environmental consultancy Stratcon Singapore. \"Incineration was great 30 years ago, but we've moved on a bit in terms of technology. You can make biogas from putrescible waste such as food waste, biomass energy from garden clippings and horticultural waste timber, and generate electricity from combustible waste like textiles and plastics.\"\n\nOne of the problems is that waste in Singapore is not segregated, he said. \"Hawker centres have the capacity to use trolleys to sort organic materials from plastics. But very few people do it, because once they do that, how do they sell it? The plastics waste will be bought, but no one buys the food waste, because the infrastructure hasn't been set up for it yet.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Central banks have also been stocking up on their physical gold reserves.\n\nCommentators have noted an increasing gap between the declining price of gold in the paper market and the rising demand in the physical gold market, fuelled by Asian countries like China and India.\n\nThey worry that the paper gold market will collapse amid a supply crunch, with unpredictable consequences for prices.\n\nMr Sinclair said that he wants to be involved in the birth of the physical gold market, which he said could take off within a year.\n\nHe wants to be able to provide a platform for a transparent valuation of gold.\n\n\"I firmly believe that if you will build it, they will come,\" he said, adding that what is unique about Singapore is that it has laws, effective regulation, technical experience and a welcoming attitude.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And it is a matter of urgency for these overseas banks, because most of these funds are moved out of Singapore on the same day.\n\nIn the first nine months of this year, 133 cases involving $15.5 million were investigated - 43 per cent higher than the 93 cases that cropped up in the whole of last year, when $24.6 million was involved.\n\nWith these monies zipping electronically out of Singapore, the rate of recovery has not been sparkling: 20 per cent for the first nine months of this year. Last year's recovery rate was more dismal - 11 per cent.\n\nIan Wong, deputy director of the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) of the Singapore Police Force, said that the customers of the overseas banks claimed that their e-mail accounts had been compromised by fraudsters who used them to send instructions to the victims' banks to transfer funds to bank accounts here.\n\nUpon realising that their money had been fraudulently moved, the victims then instruct their banks to recall the remittances.\n\nThe accounts into which these funds land and are transferred out of soon after belong to individuals, who, sometimes enticed by the commissions to be earned, are commonly recruited through social networking websites to become mules; sometimes, they are duped into becoming mules.\n\nThe fraudsters are known to be creative in roping in their accomplices. Some would claim to be recruiting \"Singapore agents\" for a foreign company - agents whose job is to open personal bank accounts to receive funds - usually from online scams.\n\nThe fraudsters are also known to use real-estate agents to launder their ill-gotten gains. Posing as potential clients responding to online property ads, they would obtain a property agent's bank account number to transfer one month's rent, but \"mistakenly\" transfer a much larger sum, after which the fraudsters would ask the agent to transfer the excess to another mule.\n\nLaw firms are also a target. Fraudsters, posing as potential clients, would engage a law firm to settle a civil dispute, say, one to recover a certain sum of money from an individual. The law firm would then receive funds in its account, purportedly transferred by the individual, though the firm may not even have contacted this individual. The fraudsters then move in and instruct the firm to keep a portion of the money as legal fees and to move the rest to a mule.\n\nThe Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS), the police here and the National Crime Prevention Council warned yesterday that individuals who allow their accounts to receive stolen funds could be fined up to $500,000 and/or be jailed up to seven years upon conviction for money laundering; if corporate accounts are used for money laundering, the fine is stiffer - up to $1 million.\n\nThe CAD's Mr Wong said the police take a serious view of the activities of money mules because their actions facilitate crime and enable the wrong-doers to evade detection.\n\n\"The illicit funds money mules help to transfer may also be used by fraudsters to finance and perpetuate their criminal activities.\"\n\nOf the 32 money mules charged since last year, 17 have been convicted, he said, the heaviest sentence so far being a 41/2-year jail term for a mule who received $1.25 million from remitters in the US, Canada and Cooks Islands.\n\nMr Wong ventured that Singaporeans are targeted because the fraudsters communicate with them easily in English, and because of the relative ease with which bank accounts can be opened in this financial hub.\n\nThere are fewer than a handful cases of the reverse scenario - that of Singaporeans getting their funds stolen and transferred out.\n\nRichard Moore, who is with the ABS anti-fraud task force, said Singapore is not immune to such attempts, but \"Singapore banks are not losing money because of robust controls here. While there have been attempts at this type of activity, loss has not been incurred.\"\n\nABS director Ong-Ang Ai Boon said banks here are on high alert, and will file suspicious transaction reports (STRs) with the police whenever there is unusual movement of funds into customers' accounts. Last year, 17,000 STRs were filed; 15,000 have so far been filed this year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In view of the SGX-ST's rejection of the company's application, the company will be delisted.\"\n\nUnder listing requirements Rule 1314, an issuer on the watch-list may apply to SGX for its removal from the watch-list if it satisfies any one of the following requirements: the issuer records consolidated pre-tax profit for the most recently completed financial year; and has an average daily market capitalisation of $40 million or more over the last 120 market days on which trading was not suspended or halted.\n\nSGX also informed Aussino in its letter that \"the company or its controlling shareholder(s) must comply with Listing Rule 1309, which requires the company or its controlling shareholder(s) to provide a reasonable exit offer to shareholders. The SGX-ST will grant the company an extension of time for the company or its controlling shareholder(s) to make an exit offer. The company is required to advise the SGX-ST of the exit offer proposal as soon as practicable and no later than one month from the date of the SGX letter.\"\n\nTrading in Aussino shares will continue until 5pm on Dec 20.\n\n\"Whatever minority shareholders are left are obviously scrambling for the exit with this announcement,\" said a trader. \"Most don't seem to be want to wait around for the exit offer, given the company's loss-making status.\"\n\nAussino has been on the SGX watch-list since Sept 6, 2011 after recording pre-tax losses for the three most recent completed consecutive financial years. It was required to meet the requirements of Rule 1314 within 24 months from Sept 6, 2011, failing which SGX would either delist the company or suspend trading of the company's shares.\n\nThe company made a net loss of $8 million in FY2013, with total current liabilities exceeding total assets by $153,162.\n\nTraders noted that the stock had more than halved in April this year, when SGX had rejected the company's application for a $70 million reverse takeover (RTO) deal with Max Strategic Investments, which SGX had said was linked to a Myanmar tycoon on the US sanctions list.\n\nAussino shares had run up sharply previously, after it said last year that it would issue new shares to buy the energy business of Max Myanmar Group headed by Myanmar tycoon U Zaw Zaw.\n\nOn Nov 6, the group said it planned to issue US$30 million in convertible senior notes to an investor, Crede CG III, Ltd, an institutional investor based in the United States.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It can operate in water depths of 400 feet and drill to depths of 40,000 feet.\n\n\"Customer acceptance of the Ensco 120 series design has been remarkably strong because the rig has proprietary, patented technology that significantly increases the operational efficiencies in harsh environments,\" said Ensco's chairman and chief executive officer Dan Rabun.\n\n\"This is certainly a positive for the company, on the back of its recent five-rig order from Transocean,\" said Clement Chen, equity research analyst at Barclays Capital. \"It highlights the strength of the jack-up markets globally but also the importance of owning a well-accepted proprietary design that serves as a natural barrier to entry to other players trying to compete in the space.\"\n\nTo date, Keppel O&M has delivered 17 newbuild rigs to Ensco, with four on order including this latest contract.\n\nIn November, it secured a US$1.1 billion order from US-based Transocean to build five jack-up rigs with options for five more.\n\nIn October, it secured jack-up rig orders from Mexico's Perforadora Central and Clearwater Capital Partners of the US worth around US$240 million and US$440 million respectively.\n\nThis latest Ensco deal lifts Keppel O&M's 2013 year-to-date orders to $6.7 billion. Its net order book as at end-September stood at $13.6 billion.\n\nKeppel Corp's shares closed unchanged at $11.11 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The airport saw 6.9 per cent more passengers year-on-year in September and passenger movement growth of 9.4 per cent in August. Meanwhile, aircraft landings and takeoffs rose 6.7 per cent to 29,500 in October.\n\nDuring the month, Changi Airport handled 157,400 tonnes of cargo, up 1.8 per cent from a year ago. Cargo volumes contracted 2.5 per cent year-on-year in September and were down 0.5 per cent in August.\n\n\"Passenger traffic to North-east Asia, South-east Asia and the Middle East grew in the 10 months ended October,\" said CAG. \"Among Changi Airport's top 10 country markets, Indonesia, Japan and Malaysia registered double-digit traffic growth for the month.\"\n\nFor the 10-month period, total passenger movements worked out to 44.14 million, up 5.4 per cent, while cargo volumes edged up 0.8 per cent to 1.53 million tonnes.\n\nNew services being launched at Changi include Scoot's five times weekly flight to Hong Kong. Meanwhile, Tigerair is launching three new services to Chiang Mai and Langkawi, both operating four times weekly, as well as a thrice-weekly service to Lombok.\n\nBudget carrier Thai AirAsia is starting a daily service to Krabi while SilkAir is adding a thrice-weekly service to Yogyakarta.\n\nThis year, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects global passenger growth to hit 5 per cent, while cargo growth is expected to come in at 0.9 per cent.\n\nAsia-Pacific carriers are likely to clock 6.6 per cent in passenger traffic growth, which will help contribute to a bottom line of US$3.1 billion for the region. However, this too has been downgraded by US$1.5 billion because of slower growth in key emerging economies and a lacklustre performance in the cargo market.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With this sale, the company's stake in Australand will go from 59.1 per cent down to 39.1 per cent, though Australand remains its single largest investment outside Singapore and China.\n\nThe proceeds will be used to invest in opportunities in its core markets in Singapore and China, as well as for general working capital purposes, the company said yesterday.\n\nCapitaLand president and chief executive Lim Ming Yan said in a statement that the partial sale \"will improve Australand's liquidity and attract more institutional investors\". \"We are comfortable with our remaining interest in Australand and it will remain a key investment for us.\"\n\nAnalysts remained positive on CapitaLand, with four maintaining their \"buy\" calls yesterday.\n\nNomura analyst Sai Min Chow said CapitaLand had \"locked in some gains at a good price\", and cited the management as having said that it was still possible for some proceeds to be paid to shareholders.\n\nAustraland had attracted suitors even before CapitaLand said at the beginning of the year that it could be up for sale. CapitaLand, which said it wanted to streamline its operations and focus on its core markets, concluded in July that Australand remained a key investment.\n\nFor the partial sale on Wednesday, CapitaLand appointed Citi the sole bookrunner and underwriter. Eventually, the price of A$3.685 was arrived at for the sale of 115.66 million Australand stapled securities after an overnight accelerated book build. The Business Times understands that the securities were placed out to institutional investors from Australia and abroad, including the US.\n\nThe price was at the low end of the range of transaction terms of A$3.685 to A$3.75 reported by news wires. Nevertheless, it was at a mere 1.7 per cent discount to the A$3.75 per stapled security at which Australand last traded. CapitaLand said it would continue to benefit from the strong recurring income in Australand's commercial and industrial portfolio, as well as the improvement in the Australian residential market.\n\nAustraland's free float after the transaction increased by half, and this significantly improves its ranking in the ASX 200 and ASX 200 A-Reit indices, CapitaLand said.\n\nThe sale is expected to be completed on Nov 26. CapitaLand will record a loss of about S$127.5 million. This is due to the recognition of S$162.9 million of foreign currency translation reserve and interest rate hedging reserve losses, partially offset by a divestment gain of S$8.8 million and a fair-value gain of S$26.6 million on the remeasurement of CapitaLand's remaining stake.\n\nThe accounting changes were caused by the deconsolidation process. With CapitaLand's stake in Australand having dropped below 50 per cent, the Australian developer is no longer a subsidiary. There is no expected impact on CapitaLand's net tangible asset value, which came to S$3.63 a share as at end-September.\n\nAssuming the placement was done at the beginning of the year, CapitaLand's earnings per share for the first three quarters of the year would decrease from 16.6 cents to 13 cents.\n\nIn the stock market yesterday, CapitaLand closed down a cent at S$3.05, while Australand was down 15 Australian cents, or 4 per cent, at A$3.60.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Who are the real bad guys? Well, it depends on which side of the fence you sit on as fingers are pointed anonymously online.\n\nEnglish screenwriter Steven Knight (Dirty Pretty Things, Eastern Promises, and just earlier this year Redemption, which starred actor hero Jason Statham in a slightly serious dramatic role) looks at both sides of the coin when a bomb goes off in London's Borough market in his latest thriller Closed Circuit.\n\nSlickly directed by John Crowley (Boy A, Is Anybody There?), the film also doubles as a tense legal drama with two lawyers who used to be lovers, Martin Rose (Eric Bana) and Claudia Simmons-Howe (Rebecca Hall), being assigned to defend the bombing's primary suspect Farroukh Erdogan (Denis Moschitto).\n\nThe high-profile case is set to be the trial of the century with it being argued in both open court and behind closed doors because of the sensitive nature of some of the evidence. As one is handling the open court proceedings and the other, the closed-door, they are barred from communicating with each other. And they think it's in their best interest to keep their past out of the public eye anyway.\n\nBut as Rose digs deeper into the case, some dangerous truths and a conspiracy theory starts to emerge. Fearing for his ex-lover's safety and determined to expose the real baddies behind the bombing, he tries to reach Simmons-Howe and becomes engaged in a cat-and-mouse game that threatens to once again put national security at risk.\n\nWithout giving too much away, Knight fills the plot with plenty of cloak-and-dagger stuff and Crowley compacts it all into a tight 90-minute package.\n\nThe edge-of-the-seat action plays out with the intensity of a time bomb as one dirty secret after another is exposed. Some of it might not be totally logical but both Crowley and Knight give the audience little time to question things because of Closed Circuit's brisk pacing.\n\nBana and Hall are well-cast in their roles - the Australian actor makes an art out of being high-strung yet looks every bit like the screen hunk he is with his flashy suit and carefully sculpted coiffure.\n\nBritish actress Hall plays her character with vulnerability but is never weak or resigned to meekness.\n\nClosed Circuit is a smart and dark thinking man's thriller that questions the price of national security and if any organisation has the right to do whatever it feels like so the citizens of a country can sleep peacefully at night.\n\nThe premise might not be the most original with many other films and even television series nowadays using a terrorist attack to launch a plot.\n\nBut it's cleverly written, well-crafted and has more than enough moments leading up to the finale when justice is served. And that more than justifies the price of a ticket.\n\nRating:\n\nB\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The result was also well below the government's version of the PMI, which hit 51.4 last month.\n\nAmong the sub-indexes, new export orders fell under the 50 mark, pointing to a fragile global recovery, while employment also decreased. Overall new orders rose but at a slower rate than last month, suggesting that internal demand was still not strong enough to support growth. A reading above 50 indicates expansion while anything below signals contraction.\n\nMarkets responded negatively to the data with shares falling in Hong Kong and Shanghai.\n\n\"China's growth momentum softened a little in November,\" Qu Hongbin, HSBC chief economist for China, said in a statement accompanying the data. \"That said, this is still the second-highest PMI reading in seven months.\"\n\nGDP grew 7.8 per cent in Q3, recovering from two quarters of slowing growth after the government implemented, over the summer, a \"mini stimulus\" via investments in the housing and transport sectors. Despite a rebound in most sectors of the economy in the past months, economists had expected the recovery to soften near the end of this year, as the new government seeks to move to a more sustainable consumption-led growth model.\n\nChina also has to deal with an over-leveraged economy, over-capacity and unproductive state-owned companies. The central bank has recently sent rates soaring after reining in credit, another sign that the leaders are determined to depart from previous growth patterns.\n\n\"The downbeat flash PMI adds to the evidence that the recent economic rebound is fading. The efforts of policymakers to slow credit growth are set to further weigh on growth in the months ahead,\" said Qinwei Wang, an economist with Capital Economics.\n\nThe Communist Party published a blueprint last week highlighting key reforms, with a strong focus on rebalancing and restructuring the economy over the next decade.\n\n\"Mostly because of the magnitude of the debt problem, the path will inevitably be bumpy,\" wrote Societe-Generale China economist Yao Wei in a report.\n\n\"We think that the policy trajectory going forward will consist of many repetitions of this year's pattern: policymakers force deleveraging and quicken reform; as a result, growth decelerates and financial risk rises; when the situation becomes too precarious, they pause deleveraging and stabilise the economy (with some investment); then as soon as the economy steadies, they go again,\" she added.\n\nThe official growth target for this year has been set at 7.5 per cent, a figure that most economists think China will outperform. The final reading of the HSBC PMI will be released on Dec 2, a day after the official one published by the statistics bureau.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Unfortunately, after the unveiling of the statue in May 2011, it seems that the honour of this commission was elbowed out of the spotlight by a flood of negative criticism about his work.\n\nAccording to art critics and public opinion, Rainaldi's statue, Conversazioni, was said to bear little resemblance to the late Pope John Paul II, who died in 2005.\n\nEven Rainaldi himself was unhappy with the way that the statue turned out, and says that something intangible had gone missing when the foundry workers were putting together the 40 pieces that made up his five tonne statue.\n\n\"The idea was the same, but (my initial model) was more fluid. During the execution of the first statue, something was lost in the fluidity,\" says the 56-year-old, whose works are part of a small exhibition currently on display at the Partners & Mucciaccia Gallery at the Gillman Barracks till mid-February.\n\nA plaster model, some bronze sculptures and a few other conceptual sketches of Conversazioni are featured and is part of the 49-piece larger exhibition titled Works 2003-2013. The art pieces are for sale, priced from 8,000 euros (S$13,450) to 130,000 euros.\n\n\"An artist works with millimetres. The difference between one artist's work and another is in the millimetres, not metres. If you're wrong by just three millimetres, it can look like it's big or fat,\" explains Rainaldi fervently. In the end, he says that it was his personal dissatisfaction with the first statue that drove him to redesign it over a period of nine months, and not the criticisms that he received.\n\nThe second unveiling took place in September last year, and the statue currently stands in front of Rome's Termini train station.\n\nIn hindsight, the \"constructive evolution\" turned out to have been \"necessary\", says the artist in halting English. \"It's hard to explain, but you know it's like when you make something and it doesn't turn out the way you want. But even bad things happen for a good reason,\" he says.\n\nThis controversial piece of work aside, the rest of Rainaldi's work on display all have a spiritual sense to them, which comes from his own religious beliefs as well as his background of studying theology.\n\nFor example, one of his series of works is titled Caduti (Fallen). It represents how Mankind has sinned as portrayed in the Bible, so every piece in the series has its head hung to face the ground in shame.\n\nThe artist later reveals that at one point in his life, he actually considered becoming a priest. But he ended up taking what he jokingly calls a \"big detour\" when he met the woman who would later become his wife and go on to have three children with him.\n\nWhen asked what he wants people to take away from his exhibition, Rainaldi says that his biggest target is for his work to raise questions about anything at all - be it his art, religion, or life in general.\n\n\"The best things about any artwork is that they talk to you. They need to communicate, so it's best if everyone not just look at it, but listen to it too. Because if you see something that is flat, and doesn't speak to you, then it's not good because there isn't any emotion. But the questions only come once it speaks to you,\" he says.\n\nOliviero Rainaldi's works will be on display at the Partners & Mucciaccia Gallery at Block 6 Lock Road, #02-10 Gillman Barracks, till Feb 16. Opening hours are from noon to 7pm from Tues to Fri, 11am to 7pm on Sat and noon to 6pm on Sun.

However, staff in sales and marketing pose a much higher risk for frauds, such as falsifying revenue and dishonest expense claims.\"\n\nThe study found that the most prevalent type of fraud is the misappropriation of assets (56 per cent) - of which embezzlement made up 40 per cent and procurement fraud 27 per cent.\n\nMost fraudulent acts were carried out over one to five years, with 93 per cent being committed in multiple transactions.\n\nWhen fraudsters acted alone, 9 per cent of the frauds incurred a total cost exceeding US$5 million. When they acted in collaboration with others, 16 per cent had a total value of greater than US$5 million.\n\nIn Singapore, about 70 per cent of the fraudsters analysed were employed by the victim company and they tended to be opportunists. KPMG also found that many companies here have fewer fraud deterrence measures in place and are especially vulnerable to procurement fraud. A tendency to focus almost exclusively on price, over other factors such as track record and the results of vendor due diligence, can leave companies vulnerable.\n\n\"Simply picking the lowest bid leaves a company exposed not only to problems such as underperformance but also frauds such as bid-rigging and kickbacks provided to their staff for inside information,\" Mr Hawkes said.\n\nKPMG believes that understanding the characteristics of a typical fraudster - and also the fact that these are subject to change with time - will enable organisations to better protect themselves against being defrauded.\n\nAn important change or development in recent years is the growing use of technology by fraudsters, and not just in the technologically advanced countries. About 46 per cent of all fraudsters were computer-literate.\n\nIn Singapore, the recent cyberattacks on government websites show how cyberattacks and high-tech fraud are becoming increasingly common.\n\n\"Some companies in Singapore have not significantly updated their defences in some time. What worked a few years ago will no longer be enough to keep company assets and data safe,\" said Mr Hawkes.\n\nTechnology enables not only the fraudster, but also the organisation to defend itself. Companies will have to think harder about whether old fraud prevention technologies still apply.\n\nNewer approaches such as data analytics and data mining give the company a much better chance of catching the fraudster, KPMG said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

HELMI YUSOF reports\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Nov 21, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTWO years ago, when art lover Serenella Ciclitira was in Indonesia, she asked a group of Indonesian artists: \"Do you have a museum of modern art that I could visit?\"\n\nThey replied: \"Yes, we do. It's in Singapore; it's called the Singapore Art Museum.\"\n\nTo her, their dry reply underlines the inadequate art infrastructure that hinders the development of many Asian art scenes, particularly in parts of South-east Asia and Central Asia. With a weak gallery system and few or no museums to showcase their country's art, many good Asian artists are not getting the recognition that they deserve.\n\nThat is why she and her husband David helped found the Prudential Eye Awards through their not-for-profit organisation Parallel Contemporary Art and the famous Saatchi Gallery. Title-sponsored by life insurer Prudential, the award aims to recognise emerging Asian talent in five categories - photography, painting, sculpture, installation and digital video.\n\nTo be launched next January, the award will cover artists in over 30 countries in what Ms Ciclitira calls the \"greater Asian region\" - from Kazakhstan to China to Indonesia to Australia. The overall winner not only gets a total of US$50,000 in prize money, he will also see his works on display in the influential Saatchi Gallery in London.\n\nSaatchi's involvement\n\nThe Saatchi Gallery is owned by the controversial advertising giant and art collector Charles Saatchi, who has often riled the art world for what some describe as a large and undue influence on the art market.\n\nBut as far as Ms Ciclitira is concerned, Mr Saatchi is a force of good because of his ostensibly magnanimous support of the arts.\n\nShe says: \"His gallery is incredibly popular with art lovers to visit - even children visit it - which goes to show that Saatchi Gallery is curating art that captures the imagination of the new generation of art lovers. You can't say that about all galleries.\"\n\nSaatchi aside, Ms Ciclitira herself has exerted some influence on the art market. Since 2008, she has been curating country-specific exhibitions in South Korea, Hong Kong and Indonesia under Global Eye programme.\n\nThese exhibitions - titled Korean Eye, Hong Kong Eye and Indonesian Eye respectively - comes with a comprehensive catalogue that showcases 75 talented artists from the countries. These catalogues have become authoritative insider guides to the art scenes of these countries, used by collectors, curators and gallerists.\n\n\"In Korea, when I curated the exhibition and book Korean Eye in 2008, there were very few available books on Korean art in English then. Since then, I would go to an art fair and I'd see gallerists using the book to show to collectors and say: 'Look, my artist has appeared in the Korean Eye - that's how good he is.'\"\n\nNow, the Global Eye Programme is set to do the same for the Malaysian market. Next April, it will be launching the Malaysian Eye exhibition and book featuring the best in contemporary Malaysian art.\n\nMs Ciclitira is also setting her sights on curating a Singapore Eye by 2015 though plans are not firmed up yet. For now, though, Prudential is also sponsoring the Prudential Singapore Young Artist Award in partnership with Lasalle College of the Arts for art students, with a prize of US$10,000.\n\nThough some may demur the involvement of the Saatchi Gallery because of its controversial owner, Ms Ciclitira is clear on one thing.\n\nShe's never sold her art\n\nOver the years, she and her husband have amassed an enviable collection of 350 artworks, some by award-winning artists. But, unlike Mr Saatchi, who has had a hand in both raising and lowering the prices of the artists whom he collects, the Ciclitiras have never sold a single one of their artworks.\n\nShe insists: \"We collect art only because we love it. We do it for pleasure, not for investment. We sometimes see the crazy prices that some artworks have gotten at auctions. But we are certain we want to keep this art for our own enjoyment.\"\n\nBesides her, the judges of the award are Nigel Hurst, CEO, Saatchi Gallery; Tsong-Zung Chang, co-founder, Asia Art Archive; Sir David Green, former director-general, British Council; Nick Mitzevich, director, Art Gallery of Southern Australia; Lee Young Hye, creative director, Gwangju Design Biennale; Andre Erofeev, independent curator and critic; and Tan Boon Hui, group director, Programmes Group, National Heritage Board of Singapore.\n\nhelmi@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We have since resolved the issue and bookings in the pending queue are currently being processed and cleared.\"\n\nCustomers also experienced some difficulties with the website on Wednesday due to a separate issue with the booking system, which has also been rectified, the company said.\n\nHowever, judging from some of the comments on the airline's Facebook page, complaints about the inability to book flights on the website started as far back as Monday.\n\nOne irate customer went on to buy a ticket with another airline after receiving an error message from the Tigerair website while trying to pay for her flight. However, she found herself double booked when she received a confirmation from Tigerair some 13-14 hours after her botched booking attempt.\n\nWhile it isn't clear yet how much the website glitches could have cost the airline in lost revenue, the online portal is an important channel for the budget carrier as it likely contributes to the bulk of ticket sales.\n\nAccording to UOB-Kay Hian analyst K Ajith, the website alone could account for some 80 per cent of the budget carrier's bookings.\n\nTigerair, which has apologised for the inconvenience caused, said customers should call its customer care hotline if they do not receive an emailed confirmation of their booking within 24 hours.\n\nTiger Airways, which reported its second quarter results last month, swung into the black with a net profit of $23.8 million, boosted by gains from the sale of a 60 per cent stake in Tigerair Australia to Virgin Australia.\n\nRevenue fell nearly 17 per cent to $163.8 million, due to lower yields as well as from the partial disposal of its operations Down Under.\n\nShares in Tigerair closed unchanged at 50.5 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The youth, glamour, hope and power that Kennedy represented were all extinguished over the space of a few horrifying seconds that even now - thanks in part to a home movie of the actual murder - remain painfully embedded in the national psyche.\n\nParkland is a docudrama that recreates in authentic detail the moments leading up to the death of the president and the hours and days that followed, when a wave of shock, grief and guilt swept through Dallas, the scene of the crime. Written and directed by Peter Landesman in a journalistic, matter-of-fact manner, the movie focuses on a few key people and places that were instrumental to the proceedings.\n\nAided by some archival footage and the weight of history, Landesman makes no effort to embellish the facts. Viewers are given a ringside seat to perhaps the most heavily scrutinised and debated event in American political history. The filmmakers don't do much by way of making judgments or presenting conspiracy theories - that well-trodden path is best left to the likes of Oliver Stone.\n\nInstead, what we're left with are individuals - among them the ones tasked with protecting the president and when they failed, others who desperately tried to save him from dying. Parkland, which is based on a book (Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F Kennedy) by Vincent Bugliosi and refers to the hospital where Kennedy was taken after the shooting, does a decent (if a little stodgy) by-the-book interpretation of the effect that the killing had on everyone - from the First Lady, the FBI and Secret Service agents to the doctors and nurses at Parkland and Abraham Zapruder, the man who unwittingly (and famously) recorded the killing on his 8mm movie camera.\n\nInterestingly, one of the primary characters in Parkland is Robert Oswald (James Badge Dale), the brother of assassin Lee Harvey Oswald (Jeremy Strong) and a man who unwittingly finds himself at the centre of the storm. Their mother Marguerite (Jacki Weaver) is portrayed as a deluded oddball who tries to force her way in from the fringes of history.\n\nThe movie's ensemble cast - including Paul Giamatti as Zapruder, Zac Efron as doctor James Carrico, Marcia Gay Harden as head nurse Doris Nelson, Ron Livingston as FBI agent James Hosty and Billy Bob Thornton as Secret Service agent Forrest Sorrels - all perform with admirable restraint for the greater good.\n\n\"Just the facts, ma'am,\" a line attributed to detective Joe Friday in the television series Dragnet, comes to mind here, because Landesman seems to have taken it to heart.\n\nThe tragic events of 50 years ago - and the chaos and recriminations that followed - shattered much more than just one man's life. It's a chapter that could perhaps have been avoided - despite its strict adhesion to the facts, Parkland does allow itself to pose a \"what if\" question or two. The scars from that day are still present in one form or another. \"I will never be ordinary again,\" declares Marguerite Oswald. Neither would anyone else.\n\nRating:\n\nC+\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Both themes feature prominently in his first full-length production for THE Dance Company, premiering soon at Contact 2013 dance festival.\n\n\"The piece seeks to question audiences on whether communication is important to humans,\" explains Kim, who's the resident choreographer of the company.\n\nDrawing from his experience in Singapore, Kim adds that he found an Asian identity that inspired him for the piece, entitled Mr Sign, which revolves around emotional satisfaction in relationships and easing troubled minds in society.\n\nIn the piece, he will have dancers seeking release from social convention by sprouting gibberish and performing a kind of text-based dance, even if the text is not a comprehensible language.\n\nLeaning towards dance theatre, Kim also is known for engineering and composing his own music for his choreography.\n\nFor Mr Sign, he is utilising the score from Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. \"The first part depicts a person that cannot express himself, and thus uses a section in the music in a bid for others to understand him. The desire that this person has is similar to the portion from Swan Lake that portrays a passionate image; hence I used it as the title song,\" he explains.\n\nFor the second part, entitled Public Sphere, another Swan Lake segment is used to portray idealistic conversations for fair communication. \"I felt that the dance of the Four Swans could ideally express this conversation better than any other; therefore I used Part One of the Four Swans music to make the message easily comprehensible for the audience.\"\n\nBut Kim has also mixed his musical influences, by utilising the traditional genre of \"trot music\" from Korea combined with the traditional gamelan music of Indonesia.\n\nLast year, Kim's piece for Contact was a relentlessly energetic work, and this year's promises the same high-powered output.\n\nMr Sign will open the dance festival which features 16 international and regional artists from nine countries.\n\nThe festival also includes an acclaimed solo work by Danish artist Kitt Johnson, and a duet by Compania Nacional de Danza principal dancer Tamako Akiyama and her husband Dimo Kirilov.\n\nThrough the AFX - Asian Festivals Exchange - Contact forges connections and exchanges within Singapore and the region. AFX will present two collaborative works - one between Singapore artist Liz Fong and Yuriko Suzuki of the Yokohama Dance Collection, and the other between Seoul Dance Collection's award-winning Korean choreographer Choi Myung Hyun and Malaysia's Damansara Performing Arts Centre Dance Company's artistic director Wong Jyh Shyong.\n\nIn Accents of South-east Asia, the festival will feature emerging choreographers such as Singapore's Goh Shou-Yi, Malaysia's James Kan and Vietnam's Ngo Thanh Phuong.\n\nContact 2013 will be held from Nov 29 to Dec 8.

OCBC - which has long been a supporter of local sports - now owns the exclusive naming rights to a multi-purpose indoor arena, an aquatic centre, two club lounges in the National Stadium as well as the VIP lounge in the Singapore Indoor Stadium.\n\nAs widely expected, the 55,000-seater National Stadium - the crown jewel of the Sports Hub - was not included as part of the naming rights package. This was in line with the desire to preserve the historic venue - home to so many major events over the decades including famous football victories and the annual National Day Parade - as a Singapore icon.\n\nIn a surprise move, however, the authorities also deemed that the Singapore Indoor Stadium would not be named after a commercial entity for the same reasons. The government later said that one or both stadiums could possibly be named after a personality some time down the road in order to commemorate or remember him or her.\n\nWhile few will argue that it is the right move to keep the National Stadium off limits to commercial branding, there is perhaps a missed opportunity when it comes to getting the most out of the Singapore Indoor Stadium.\n\nApart from the National Stadium, the 12,000-capacity Indoor Stadium (which opened in the late 1980s) is the next most recognisable facility within the entire Sports Hub. One could certainly surmise that the entire naming rights package could well have been worth much more had the Indoor Stadium been made part of the deal as well. The extra money - quite possibly in the tens of millions of dollars - could have been spent on many more meaningful community or sporting initiatives in and around the Sports Hub.\n\nAs Acting Culture, Community and Youth Minister Lawrence Wong put it, it is important to get the right balance in preserving the public character of the Sports Hub project, while attracting corporate sponsorship for venues that will help activate and catalyse the sports industry in Singapore.\n\nThe door should not be closed entirely on the Indoor Stadium, given that such naming rights contracts last only for a specific period. After all, if there is a major brand out there that is more than willing to pump in good money that will boost Singapore's sports scene, then it would be wise to at least consider the pros and cons.\n\nAll things considered, should the authorities change their minds one day in the future and decide to put the naming rights to the Indoor Stadium up for sale, there will likely be no shortage of corporates ready to snap up that offer in a heartbeat.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The regulator also gave SingTel until April 2018 - an extension from the April 2014 deadline - to sell down its stake in the trust.\n\nIDA's approval, which comes with several conditions, follows the vehement opposition to the sale by six Internet service providers (ISPs) in September. These ISPs compete in the same fibre broadband space as SingTel and had objected to the prospect of SingTel wholly owning the only nationwide fibre provider in Singapore.\n\nYesterday, M1, one of the service providers, said: \"We are still evaluating the details of IDA's decision. OpenNet's less-than-satisfactory performance to date has adversely impacted the Next Generation Nationwide Broadband Network (NGNBN) customer experience, and we hope this new arrangement will result in tangible improvements that benefit consumers.\"\n\nNetLink Trust owns the ducts and manholes through which the network's optical fibre cables pass. It is 100 per cent owned by SingTel but the majority of the board of its trustee-manager, CityNet, is independent.\n\nPost-buyout, CityNet will take over OpenNet's role of rolling out the nationwide fibre broadband network and providing the services that the latter is currently offering.\n\nThis will happen in two phases. After the buyout, the first phase will see OpenNet's business and assets transferred to NetLink Trust. SingTel will give up its role as key subcontractor to OpenNet and transfer employees, skills and expertise to the trust.\n\nIn the second phase, CityNet will assume the OpenNet role. By April 2018, SingTel is to have pared down its stake in NetLink Trust to below 25 per cent. The original deadline was April 2014, but SingTel had requested an extension until 2018.\n\nYesterday, IDA said that this extension was \"not unreasonable\" given the scope of the undertaking. Other industry players had previously expressed their \"grave concerns\" about the requested deadline extension, saying that for as long as SingTel continued to hold significant ownership of NetLink Trust, \"CityNet will always be under an obligation to put SingTel's interests ahead of any other party\".\n\nTo address this concern, one of IDA's conditions for the sale is the establishment of a monitoring board to keep CityNet and SingTel in check until the latter reduces its stake to below 25 per cent. This monitoring board will be staffed by government representatives and not industry ones.\n\nAnother one of IDA's conditions obliges SingTel to act \"reasonably and in utmost good faith\" as a CityNet unitholder. CityNet will not be allowed to take into account unitholders' interests which have no relation to their investment in the trust. No more than 25 per cent of CityNet's directors can be appointed by SingTel.\n\nThese conditions were a reaction to fears by other industry players that the Business Trust Act would oblige CityNet to put SingTel's interest ahead of its own.\n\nPost-buyout, CityNet should have \"full independence\" in making decisions for the prices and terms of its service offerings, IDA said.\n\nNow, the parties mooting the sale have up to 14 days to accept the terms. CityNet said it would \"examine the additional conditions . . . and will revert within 14 days\".\n\n\"The purchase of OpenNet is about streamlining processes in the industry and ensuring greater accountability with a single point of contact for fibre, ducts and manhole operations,\" said its chairman, Yap Chee Keong.\n\n\"We want to reiterate CityNet's commitment to ensuring equal and open access to the NGNBN fibre network.\"\n\nWhen the proposal was mooted in August, it was roundly shouted down by rival telcos StarHub and M1 as well by as smaller ISPs. They argued that this deal would not address existing delays in connecting users to the network and would \"further entrench SingTel's dominance\".\n\nA StarHub spokeswoman said: \"We support any move to improve OpenNet's quality of service and speed of provisioning. We look forward to working with IDA and the industry to ensure that OpenNet provides quality services, in a timely manner, on an open-access and non-discriminatory basis.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They plan to drastically reduce the number of their foreign employees during the next three years from the current 74 per cent to just 35 per cent.\n\nEven in the last one year, SMEs have significantly rebalanced the proportion of local and foreign employees on their payroll. The number of SMEs with 10 per cent or fewer foreign workers has increased by almost threefold - from 12 per cent in 2012 to 33 per cent this year.\n\nHowever, this reduction in foreign employees has led to increased manpower costs due to the higher costs of hiring local staff. As many as 85 per cent of SMEs in the survey listed this as a cost that they are most affected by.\n\nNinety-five per cent of construction companies and 90 per cent of manufacturing firms indicated manpower costs as their topmost concern.\n\nConsequently, more SMEs indicated cost reduction on staff expenditure as their priority over expanding their existing range of products and services.\n\nThis preoccupation with cost issues has hurt SMEs' growth and turnover. Only 44 per cent of SMEs recorded a turnover of over $10 million for the 2012-2013 financial year, compared to 55 per cent the year before. The lower turnover was attributed to slower market growth and rising costs.\n\nSimilarly, there was a 3 per cent drop in SMEs generating a net profit of more than $500,000 for the financial year.\n\nManaging costs was critical for SMEs to make profits, and smaller companies (with a turnover of up to $5 million) accounted for as much as 78 per cent of the loss-making SMEs.\n\nOnly 7 per cent of the SMEs expect to achieve double-digit growth going forward, marking it as the lowest level in the survey's 11-year history. Up to 44 per cent expect stagnant growth.\n\nThe lack of appetite for growth (and focus on survival) is also resulting in fewer SMEs doing business overseas: 46 per cent this year compared to 54 per cent in 2012. The lack of drive also sees fewer SMEs having a business strategy: 75 per cent this year, down from 85 per cent in 2012 - with one in four SMEs having no strategy at all.\n\n\"SMEs have had to focus on cost-cutting and productivity in order to stay competitive. As a result, fewer SMEs are pursuing expansion and pushing for growth,\" said Chen Yew Nah, managing director of DP Information Group (DP Info), which conducts the annual survey.\n\nSMEs are also losing out on debt and equity financing from institutions as they are unable to highlight new business opportunities to attract funding.\n\nFinancial institutions, however, warned that this lack of ambition could be costly, and urged SMEs to step up their game plan. \"With the challenging global economic environment, it is natural that SMEs may be apprehensive about their growth plans. However, SMEs can take this opportunity to raise their game and get ready for growth,\" said Kavita Bedi, regional head of SME banking, Singapore and South-east Asia, at Standard Chartered Bank.\n\nThe survey also found that more SMEs here have a higher credit risk rating, with 43 per cent of them now falling into DP Info's \"DP7-8 High Risk\" companies - up from 25 per cent five years ago.\n\n\"SMEs need to understand that the riskiest thing to do is to stand still. After a period of stagnant growth, the balance sheets of SMEs have weakened and more SMEs are now considered to be high credit risks,\" cautioned DP Info's Ms Chen.\n\nThe survey was conducted among 10,000 SMEs, with at least 30 per cent local ownership and with not more than $100 million in annual turnover.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But since it also falls under musical theatre giant Andrew Lloyd Webber's brand name, comparisons are inevitable.\n\nAs an Andrew Lloyd Webber production, it felt like the runt of the litter that's trying too hard, while as a musical in general, it lacked heart more severely than the Tin Man thought he did in The Wizard of Oz.\n\nStarlight Express is about a child who dreams about his toy train set coming to life. Actors act as locomotives, zipping across the stage on rollerskates in breathtaking synchrony while dressed in a variety of dazzling costumes. They are the ones that the underdog steam engine Rusty intends to challenge in a race to be named the \"fastest engine in the world\".\n\nBut he must first find a race partner to qualify. So he approaches his love interest - Pearl, the observation car - who initially agrees to race with him.\n\nHowever, she quickly abandons him for the promise of a faster partner in electrical train Electra, and after one race changes her mind and hops over to pair up with reigning champion Greaseball, the diesel train.\n\nOf course, Rusty eventually overcomes all the obstacles hurled his way, and gains the blessing of Starlight Express (an omniscient presence whose title is left up to audience interpretation). By a stroke of sheer luck, he finally emerges as default champion and is deemed worthy in Pearl's eyes, so she conveniently realises she is in love with him.\n\nUsually, the recipe of the underdog story is quite a foolproof one, where hard work and a persevering spirit will eventually win the day (and audiences over).\n\nBut Starlight Express's underdog probably had too much working against him. The sincerity and earnestness of the protagonist Rusty, along with his heartfelt rendition of Starlight Express at the end of Act 1, was hopelessly lost against a backdrop of harsh flashing lights and deafening sound effects.\n\nBut the icing on top of the train wreck (pun intended) came just as the races were about to begin, and audiences were visibly gearing up for a little excitement. Alas, what they got instead was the demanding voiceover of the child, Control, telling everyone to put on their \"safety goggles\" (actually cardboard 3D glasses) so they can watch the race take place in all its glory on a 3D screen.\n\nFor diehard musical fans who have forked out up to $160 for a Category A ticket (and even more for a VIP ticket to watch \"live\" theatre), that borders on insulting.\n\nBut perhaps that's just what happens to a travelling show. After all, not every stage can be as impressive as the original one at the Apollo Victoria Theatre in West End, where characters raced live around the audience.\n\nOr perhaps this is just a classic case of a production that tried a little too hard and, along the way, went a little too far off track.\n\nStarlight Express runs till this Sunday at Marina Bay Sands' MasterCard Theatres. Tickets from $65 are available at Sistic outlets, online, and at the venue box office.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For its 75th anniversary celebration next week, the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (Nafa) has invited him and two well-known local choreographers to work with the students for its triple bill, Still Waters Run Deep.\n\nThe local choreographers are Jeffrey Tan, the former resident choreographer of Singapore Dance Theatre (STD), and Osman Abdul Hamid, artistic director of Era Dance Theatre.\n\nCousins won Matthew Bourne's inaugural New Adventures Choreographer Award in 2011, and has since been commissioned by the Scottish Ballet and National Ballet of Chile.\n\nFor Singapore, he will be presenting an excerpt of his signature piece Everything and Nothing, which he describes \"as a high energy work for 10 dancers, inspired by our perception of 'nothingness'\".\n\nHe explains: \"We often think of 'everything' and 'nothing' as being opposites. However, taking ideas from quantum physics, everything is actually a development of, a magnification of, and the result of nothingness. What we perceive as 'nothing' is actually alive. Without this 'nothing', we couldn't have everything.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Tan - who recently joined THE Dance Company as an associate artist - will be presenting Swirling, a new work commissioned by the arts academy.\n\nTan describes the work, set to the Tirol Concerto from Philip Glass' The Passage, as a contemporary ballet number that \"focuses on the fluidity of movements . . . to convey swirling and ripple effects of water\". He prefers to \"let the movements do the talking\".\n\nComing from a predominantly ballet background as the former principal dancer and resident choreographers of SDT, he felt that some of the classical roles he took on were limiting.\n\n\"I'm more attracted to the possibility of movement . . . treating the body as a kind of live sculpture which can be shaped and moulded in many different ways,\" he says.\n\nFinally, there is Osman's work, a contemporary Malay dance number titled Currents Of Time that conveys the struggle to retain one's traditions and identity amid rapid social change. Blending traditional Malay moves such as joget, zapin inang, dana and silat, the dance will be accompanied by traditional live music composed by Osman.\n\nHe says: \"I've not only shared with the students the different Malay dance genres, but also the gestures we use in our daily life and the values imparted through these gestures.\"\n\nThe three diverse works - from contemporary dance to contemporary ballet to contemporary Malay dance - will stretch the skills of Nafa's 37 student dancers and five alumni dancers.\n\nSays Caren Carino, head of the Department of Dance at Nafa: \"We want to convey our East-West contemporary profile and debunk the general perception that Nafa's dance programme is 'traditional' and 'Asian' or primarily Chinese.\"\n\n'Still Waters Run Deep' will be staged at the Esplanade Theatre non Nov 29 at 8pm.

The share of owners with at least 20 per cent equity climbed to 60.8 per cent from 58.1 per cent, making it easier for them to list properties and buy a new place.\n\n\"Home sales will pick up very nicely when people gain the equity they need to sell their house and have a downpayment for the next one,\" said Neal Soss, chief economist at Credit Suisse Group AG in New York. \"There's a magnifying effect on sales - people are able to list their home and sell it, and odds are they're going to go on and buy another one.\"\n\nA shortage of inventory has forced homebuyers to compete, driving up prices and leaving some shoppers out of the market, said Thomas Lawler, a former Fannie Mae economist who now is a housing consultant. The number of homes for sale reached a low of 1.8 million in early 2013, the fewest in more than a decade, according to data from the US National Association of Realtors.\n\n\"The pent-up demand from people who now have enough equity to sell their homes will help next year,\" said Mr Lawler, president of Lawler Economic & Housing Consulting LLC in Leesburg, Virginia. \"We'll see the effect during the spring selling season. Not a lot of people put their homes on the market during the holidays.\"\n\nWhile the supply of homes limited sales, it boosted price growth, said Michelle Meyer, a senior US economist at Bank of America Corp in New York. Shortages have caused buyers to compete for properties by raising the price they offer, she said.\n\nThe median price of an existing home rose 12.8 per cent last month, the Realtors' group reported. In August, it jumped 13.4 per cent, the fastest rate since the height of the US real estate boom in 2005.\n\n\"We'll see the pace of price growth moderate next year,\" said Ms Meyer. She estimates prices will gain 8 per cent in 2014, compared with 10 per cent in 2013.\n\nThe real estate recovery has supported economic growth for almost two years as buyers make ancillary purchases such as home decor and appliances, Ms Meyer said. Consumer spending accounts for about 70 per cent of the US economy. Gross domestic product grew at a 2.8 per cent pace in the third quarter, up from 2.5 per cent in the prior period. \"Whenever we see a house turn over, we see furniture sales and renovations that add to consumer spending,\" she said. \"With the real estate market recovering, people are feeling more confident about their situation, which makes them more willing to spend.\"\n\nAbout 10.8 million homeowners were underwater on their mortgages in the third quarter, down from 12.2 million in the second quarter, Zillow said. About 20 million people had negative equity or less than 20 per cent equity, down from 21.5 million in the prior three months. Las Vegas, Atlanta and Orlando, Florida, led major metropolitan areas with the highest rates of borrowers with less than 20 per cent equity. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

This beat the expectations of market economists, who thought the flash estimate of 5.1 per cent growth would be raised to a median forecast of 5.3 per cent.\n\nIn sequential terms too, the GDP surprised the market with an annualised 1.3 per cent jump after seasonal adjustments, contrary to the advance estimate of a one per cent quarter-on-quarter contraction. Economists were expecting a better showing, but the median of 15 forecasts submitted to Bloomberg still pointed to a 0.3 per cent drop.\n\nAfter MTI released the figures yesterday, at least four banks hiked their 2013 growth forecasts; two raised their estimates to 4 per cent, the top end of the new official estimate. This, despite the very different story unveiled yesterday on the trade front by International Enterprise Singapore. The government now expects non-oil domestic exports (NODX) to contract more sharply by 4 to 5 per cent this year than the earlier projection of a zero to one per cent fall.\n\nBut economists pointed to the October trade figures, which came out earlier this week, showing the first month of NODX growth since January and early signs of recovery.\n\nUOB economist Francis Tan said: \"Recent high-frequency data shows an improvement in the factory output of Singapore's key exporting countries, and the expected recovery in the advanced economies over the next few quarters will likely lift demand for our exports.\"\n\nThis gives him and other analysts reason to believe that the recovery in exports may soon catch up with that in industrial output.\n\nMany economists noted that Q3's strong showing went beyond the industrial sector. Not only did manufacturing growth accelerate to 5.5 per cent from a flash estimate of 4.5 per cent - thanks to a surge in electronics and rig-building activity - the services sector too, grew 6.3 per cent, beating a flash estimate of 5.7 per cent growth. In particular, segments facing the global economy, such as wholesale and retail trade and transportation and storage, expanded strongly, to offset quarter-on-quarter declines in sentiment-sensitive sectors such as finance and insurance.\n\nOther lagging sectors were the tourism-related sectors. Accommodation and food services grew a relatively weaker 3 per cent year on year, falling 1.1 per cent in sequential terms. Barclays economist Joey Chew said that these likely suffered from the depreciation in Asean currencies and weaker sentiment in the region. Comparing the first three quarters of 2013 with that of 2012, the economy expanded 3.5 per cent. MTI expects this pace of growth to carry into the final quarter.\n\nMTI's permanent secretary, Ow Foong Pheng, said: \"For the rest of the year, we expect externally oriented sectors like manufacturing, wholesale trade and transportation and storage to support growth, in line with the slight pickup in the global economy.\"\n\nConstruction, which grew 5.3 per cent in Q3, and business services, which grew 3.9 per cent, are also expected to stay resilient in this current quarter. However, it is possible that the pace of growth may moderate next year, if it falls in the lower end of the government's forecast range of 2 to 4 per cent growth for 2014.\n\nWith a slow recovery in the US and eurozone on the cards and Asia's growth likely to be mild, given structural reforms in China and fiscal consolidation in some Asean economies, MTI characterised Singapore's 2014 growth outlook as \"modest\". There are risks to this global backdrop, including uncertainties over how markets might react to the Federal Reserve's move to taper quantitative easing, or whether the US debt ceiling is raised in a timely manner. MTI sees the eurozone as still \"susceptible to a flare-up of the sovereign debt crisis\"; the risks from China are those of a sharper-than-expected slowdown as its government restructures the economy.\n\nMTI also noted that tightness in the labour market - due in part to foreign manpower curbs - will persist and could drag down growth of domestic sectors that are labour-intensive.\n\nAlthough stronger output pointed to labour productivity being favourable this time round, Mrs Ow said that the impact of policies to shift the economy towards \"productivity-led\" growth should be assessed only over the longer term.\n\nBut the take-up of grants and incentives to boost productivity has been \"encouraging\", she said, adding that as at September, the government had committed to disburse $330 million in such incentives to more than 15,000 companies.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He is currently hot on Burgundy and had heard of this wine. He certainly was aiming high - you do not get much higher unless you ask for a Montrachet by Domaine Romanee-Conti.\n\nMusigny Blanc is the name of the white chardonnay produced on Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue's Grand Cru vineyard, Musigny, in Chambolle-Musigny. Its last vintage was 1993; since then, the wine has been sold as Bourgogne Blanc because the current vines are not old enough to permit the wine to be called Musigny Blanc Grand Cru. Bourgogne Blanc it may be called today but it certainly is not priced as a Bourgogne Blanc, rather more like a Premier Cru white burgundy from the Cote de Beaune, eg Puligny-Montrachet Premier Cru Clavoillon. The wait is in sight though because the current vines were planted between 1986 and 1997, so it should not take much longer before Musigny Blanc reappears.\n\nAt its height, the production of Musigny Blanc was around 100 cases, which makes it as \"rare as the proverbial hen's teeth\". I was fortunate enough to have tasted Musigny Blanc once, during the early days of wine collecting. Sadly, I did not fully understand my good fortune at the time. What about Bourgogne Blanc itself? It is still just occasionally possible to acquire a bottle or two of this.\n\nBourgogne Blanc 2002, Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue\n\nAugust 2011 in a very crowded Chinese seafood restaurant in Port Klang. We brought the bottle.\n\nVery light yellow with tint of green; light bouquet lemony, very delicate. Very complex flavours - pears, pineapple, pomelo, almonds. Very long and very delicate taste of good ripe fruit. A hauntingly long finish. Exquisite. The wine was then nine years old. It is now two years older. Perhaps time to look at it again?\n\nThis Musigny Blanc/Bourgogne Blanc, Domaine Comte de Vogue is a classic example of the frustration one has to live with when studying Burgundy. There are wines that are impossible to acquire, whatever you are prepared to pay for it. You can buy a Romanee-Conti, or even a Henri Jayer Cros Parantoux today - all you need is a deep purse. But not a Musigny Blanc - not yet anyway. Perhaps in five years' time when the vines are old enough to meet DOC's requirements for Grand Cru.\n\nHarlan Estate, Oakville, Napa Valley\n\nIt has been quite some time since we have seen any wine producer from Napa Valley, a matter of great regret. Gone are the days when Robert Mondavi would come on his periodic visits, and then there were also the occasional visits by the people from Cakebread Cellars, Far Niente, and Opus One. So, it was a most pleasant surprise when I found myself sitting down to a rare dinner treat. The guest of honour was Don Weaver of Harlan Estate. Don had kindly brought along with him a magnum of one of Harlan Estate's early successes and which had been highly praised worldwide - RP 100 - the Harlan Estate 1994 which proved to be the star of the evening.\n\nHarlan Estate is generally regarded as one of California's \"cult wines\", in company with Screaming Eagle, Colgin Estate and others. Bill Harlan who founded this eponymous Estate in 1984 had an overriding ambition, to produce California's first First Growth. The first commercial vintage was 1990, released in 1996. The estate is planted with Cabernet Sauvignon 70 per cent, Merlot 20 per cent, and Cabernet Franc 8 per cent and Petit Verdot 2 per cent a very Bordeaux-like mix!\n\nHarlan Estate 1994 in magnum\n\nA very dark red with brownish tints, a still youthful and very fragrant, very cabernet aroma, lots of cedar wood and cassis, very seductive. Very, very impressive on the palate, a big dense concentrated wine, packed with ripe blackberry fruit, very tasty because it was so ripe and sweet. Still amazingly youthful at nearly 20 years old, partly the effects of being in magnum format. A very rich wine, very Cabernet-dominated, a hot-climate style as evidenced by the great ripeness of the fruit. Well balanced because rich as it was, it remained fresh, very seductive, and yet not cloying. The richness produced by the Napa Valley climate was well offset by its freshness. You could go on drinking this wine, every swallow being followed by an instinctive reaching out for the glass again. It would be interesting to see this wine in 10 years' time.\n\nThe evening had begun with a Chablis 2005, Domaine William Fevre, which I was delighted to see. Chablis is all too little seen on the table today, an omission greatly to be regretted. All too often, the dinner wine list begins with a Puligny or a Meursault. Domaine William Fevre, one of the most esteemed names in Chablis, and one of my favourite Chablis producers, was sold to Bouchrd Pere et Fils in 1998 following the retirement of William Fevre himself. Fortunately the wine-making style had not changed as I was very pleased to note, when in the autumn of 2000, as a member of the Grand Jury, I attended an extensive tasting of the new vintage in the Domaine's cellars in Chablis. It was very impressive.\n\nChablis Grand Cru Les Clos 2005, Domaine William Fevre.\n\nPale yellow, with that slightly flinty lightly lemony aroma of Chablis wines. Very youthful. This was reflected also on the palate which showed good density and concentration, very good freshness and ripeness. The wine tasted of a mixture of citrusy tropical fruit, with a flavour which always reminds me of what hay would taste like (!), but is actually more due to the mixed nuts. Very, very youthful, needs a lot more time. This wine will age beautifully, give it another 10 years!\n\nThis brings me back to one of my favourite hobby-horses - patience and long ageing of wines. Patience has its rewards!\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Last year's edition of the Singapore Airshow snagged more than US$30 billion in orders for commercial and military aircraft, the bulk of which came from Indonesia's Lion Air.\n\nStill, the demand for space at the fourth edition of the biennial Singapore Airshow from Feb 11 to 16 has been strong; 95 per cent of the exhibition space at the Changi Exhibition Centre has already been leased.\n\nThe venue offers 40,000 sq m of indoor space and 100,000 sq m outdoors for displaying aircraft.\n\nNew exhibitors at the show include Canada-based Vector Aerospace, Japan logistics services provider Nippon Express, the Singapore Flying College and Switzerland's ExecuJet Aviation Group.\n\nMore than seven in 10 show participants who have booked space are returning exhibitors such as established players Airbus, Boeing, ST Engineering and French aerospace group Thales.\n\nMr Lau said bookings came in faster for next year's show than for the previous one. Experia Events started accepting bookings in July 2012, at the Farnborough Airshow.\n\nThe 2012 Singapore Airshow attracted 900 companies from 50 countries. The trade delegates from 134 countries and regions numbered about 44,800, and visitors, more than 90,000 over the two days the show was open to the public.\n\nMr Lau said that although next year's show will have about the same number of exhibiting companies as 2012, the number of trade delegates will go up 10 to 15 per cent.\n\nNext year's show will introduce a \"feature country\" - the United States, an active participant at every Singapore Airshow, will be represented by more than 150 companies. This \"feature country\" series is aimed at bolstering bilateral trade between Singapore and other nations.\n\nThe upcoming airshow will also incorporate an aviation training zone for companies to showcase their products and services for pilot training, an increasingly important area as air travel continues to grow.\n\nStatic displays at the show will include Boeing's Dreamliner, military and commercial helicopters and a range of business jets from planemakers such as Cessna, Gulfstream, Embraer and Bombardier.\n\nThe event organiser is hoping to get Airbus to display its upcoming A350 wide-body plane, which will be operated by carriers such as Singapore Airlines.\n\nIn addition, the show will coincide with a series of high-level conferences catering to the global aviation industry, such as the Singapore Airshow Aviation Leadership Summit (SAALS), the Asia-Pacific Security Conference and the A*Star Aerospace Technology Leadership Forum.\n\nMinister for Transport Lui Tuck Yew will attend the SAALS, at which International Air Transport Association director-general Tony Tyler will deliver a speech.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They have grown so comfortable with each other that they practically finish each other's sentences during an interview with BT earlier this week.\n\nFerrari says that she has become fast friends with Laurent and that the chemistry they have developed is crucial to the acting. \"If you pretend, it won't work; we trust each other a lot,\" says the 23-year-old, who has previously worked on the French and Italian versions of the musical over the last four years.\n\nThe Italian actress has spent two of those starring opposite Laurent, who has also made a name for himself on the show and is a Notre Dame de Paris veteran, having been in it for the last 15 years. \"Initially, I thought I was only going to do 30 shows but I've done about 700 now,\" laughs the Canadian native, 46.\n\nThe pair are in Singapore for a promotional tour of the musical based on Victor Hugo's 1831 novel of the same name. The gothic rock opera will open here next month and is the brainchild of award-winning lyricist and composer Luc Plamondon and Richard Cocciante respectively.\n\nThe English lyrics were penned by Will Jennings, who was behind the Celine Dion hit, My Heart Will Go On. The pop diva can also be heard performing the song Live For The One I Love on the Notre Dame de Paris soundtrack album.\n\nThe musical premiered in Paris in 1998 and has enjoyed sell-out tours in France, Canada, England, Switzerland, Russia, Spain, America, Italy, Monaco and South Korea. Over 4,000 performances have been staged before 10 million people in more than 20 countries and it still holds the record for the show with the most successful first year of any musical ever produced in the Guinness Book of Records.\n\nProducer Nicolas Talar attributes the success of Notre Dame de Paris to the timeless story. Citing the song Cast Away which depicts the plight of illegal immigrants who had no human rights in 15th century France, as an example, he says that the problem is something that is still very true to this day.\n\nFerrari says that playing Esmeralda has brought out the passionate and emotional side of her in real life that she never knew she had. Laurent, on the other hand, claims he channels his inner Quasimodo by relating to all the heartbreaks he's had to suffer in life.\n\nLaurent is a well-known recording artiste back home and often wins over the crowd with his spontaneity and rock-star charisma. While on tour in Korea, he entertained the audience with his K-pop impression and it went down so well he was asked to repeat it while in China. There, he had to memorise the lyrics of Teresa Teng's The Moon Represents My Heart just moments before he performed it.\n\nNot to be outdone, the pint-sized Ferrari leaves a lasting impression with her big voice - something she attributes to singing along to AC/DC and Guns N' Roses rock anthems since she was 15. Teasing his co-star, Laurent quips: \"It's also because she has to be louder than the electric guitars if you want to hear her!\"\n\nNotre Dame de Paris opens at the MasterCard Theatres at Marina Bay Sands from Dec 17.

The film is notably well cast, with dynamic, appealing leads that are comfortably committed to their roles and top-notch veterans in secondary parts.\n\nHeading the list is Jennifer Lawrence as the memorably-named Katniss, whose prowess with a bow and arrow is matched only by her ability to annoy the cruelly totalitarian leader of the fictional country where the games take place. Lawrence, fresh from her Oscar-winning performance in Silver Linings Playbook, picks up where she left off in the first film. She's required to show more vulnerability this time around - haunted by the bad memories from her first Games - but she's equally convincing in action-heroine mode.\n\nKatniss and fellow tribute Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) are forced by President Snow (Donald Sutherland) to continue with their fake romance, devised in the first film as a subversive act that would ensure their survival as joint winners of the games. Under normal circumstances, representatives from each district would have to fight to the death until a single victor emerges from the carnage. They embark on a state-sponsored victor's tour around the impoverished districts, where they notice the growing anti-government discord that has been fuelled in large part by Katniss' open defiance of the regime. She becomes a symbol of hope for the rebellion.\n\nMeanwhile, a peeved President Snow orders his storm-troopers to crack down on dissenters, and new head gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) proposes a diabolical wrinkle to this year's games: contestants will be selected from the pool of previous winners, meaning Katniss has to do battle once again.\n\nKatniss is plagued by nightmares and is troubled by having to leave her real boyfriend Gale (Liam Hemsworth) back in the district to fend for himself. To prepare for the games, she and Peeta are mentored once more by Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), a perpetual drunk who is their district's only other past winner. His advice to Katniss: \"Stay alive.\"\n\nA substantial chunk of the movie is over by the time the games even get underway. Then it's Lost meets Survivor in a giant domed tropical arena as Katniss, Peeta and their fellow contestants contend with a number of hazards while trying to stay alive - including lightning strikes, torrential blood, a deadly fog bank and, for a bit of variety, a hostile baboon troop.\n\nIt's hard to keep a good girl warrior down, though. The final book will be presented in two parts and Games devotees will have to wait another year for the penultimate film to be released. Until then, the odds - and the box-office gods - will forever be in Katniss' favour.\n\nRating:\n\nB\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But it is probably time to be realistic and realise that this isn't a sure path for owners to enjoy windfalls through en-bloc sales,\" said Ong Kah Seng, director at R'ST Research.\n\nGiven that the government has successfully unlocked land from other sources, there was no need to increase plot ratios, said Alan Cheong, Savills Singapore's head of research and consultancy.\n\n\"We still have pockets of infield sites in the heartland. Why would we want to increase plot ratio in established areas and soak up demand which is going to the new regions that the government is planning?\" he asked.\n\nThe key is to expand more land and provide more communal spaces, said Donald Han, managing director of Chesterton Singapore. \"Currently, 5.3 million people live in approximately 71,400 hectare (ha), or 74 persons per ha. By 2030, another 76,000 ha will be made available for an increased population of up to 1.9 million. This reflects a lower density ratio of about 49 persons per ha,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, more focus should be given to the manufacturing sector to ensure that the real estate hardware continues to cater to the fast-changing nature of the sector, said Ms Chia.\n\nHaving shown a willingness to modify existing real estate templates to update the housing environment for the current needs of the population, such as through the introduction of public housing flats for singles and multi-generation housing units, the government needs to adopt a similar strategy to ensure that manufacturing-related companies still have a place in Singapore's factories, and are not disqualified as commercial entities in the economy, she said.\n\n\"If the government wishes to promote all spheres of business with an entrepreneurial spirit, there should also be affordable 'no-frills' commercial premises made available for businesses, including small-and-medium enterprises,\" she added.\n\nThat said, there has been a real effort to rejuvenate all the old and existing industrial spaces which have been key drivers for Singapore from the 1970s, said Desmond Sim, associate director at CBRE Research. \"(As) we are going through economic restructuring, it looks like the industrial zoning will be zoned by clusters. So if a food manufacturer is in Defu and Defu is going to (focus on) light industrial, they will encourage the food manufacturer to move to a food belt like Bedok . . . This more concerted effort to cluster complementary industries together allows for economies of scale.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He promised on Saturday to \"pull out all stops to deepen financial sector reforms\".\n\nDariusz Kowalczyk, an economist at Credit Agricole in Hong Kong, said Mr Zhou's comments could mean that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) will widen the trading band of the yuan in the near term. \"That probably means there is more upside for the renminbi,\" he said.\n\nThe yuan, also known as the renminbi, has risen this year to 6.09 per US dollar from 6.23 at the end of 2012 and hit a record high of close to 6.08 in October.\n\nHowever, there was little evidence of any new- found freedom for the yuan in trading yesterday. On the one hand, the central bank set its daily fixing for the starting point of yuan trade at a record high, but dealers said open market gains were checked by state-run banks selling the currency, probably on behalf of the central bank.\n\nIn addition, the daily fixing has been consistently weaker than the spot market, indicating that the central bank is trying to rein in the currency's strength.\n\n\"The PBOC is still intervening heavily to prevent the CNY (yuan) from appreciating more,\" said RBS economists Louis Kuijs and Tiffany Qiu in a client note, referring to dollar trade inflows and speculation that are putting the yuan under pressure to rise. \"Freeing up the currency would imply a very large appreciation versus the US dollar, something for which we believe there would not be appetite right now.\"\n\nMr Zhou's latest comments were released as part of a public guide book to the Communist Party's reforms.\n\nIn the guide book, Mr Zhou says the central bank will gradually expand the yuan's trading band to help make the currency more flexible and market-driven - comments that repeat a long-standing central bank position.\n\n\"We will widen the floating range of the yuan exchange rate in an orderly manner and increase the two-way flexibility of the currency,\" Mr Zhou was quoted as saying.\n\nTo that end, the PBOC will \"basically\" exit from regular intervention on the currency market, he said, going slightly further than in previous comments when he had said it would reduce intervention.\n\nFor years, the central bank has bought up foreign exchange, mostly US dollars, to curb strength in the yuan fuelled by the country's export engine, building the world's biggest currency stockpile of US$3.66 trillion.\n\nSuch currency intervention has been a key driver of money and credit expansion, fanning inflationary risks and housing bubbles.\n\nThe yuan's trading band was last widened in April 2012 to allow the exchange rate to rise or fall 1 per cent either side of the midpoint fixing announced daily by the central bank. \"We must seize the favourable time window to quicken the pace of realising yuan convertibility in capital account,\" Mr Zhou said.\n\nFull convertibility would allow the free movement of capital across China's borders, a demand of many of China's trading partners.\n\nThe central bank has pledged to make the yuan \"basically convertible\" by 2015, but it has not made clear what that means.\n\nSome analysts caution against high expectations for the speed of financial reform, noting that some policymakers fear that allowing the currency to move freely too quickly could expose the economy to volatile capital flows, such as the ones blamed on the US Federal Reserve's economic stimulus programme.\n\nAnalysts expect the central bank to unveil a long-awaited deposit insurance system by the end of this year or early in 2014 to pave the way for freeing up bank deposit rates, which are now subject to administrative caps.\n\nSuch a scheme would protect depositors as Beijing is concerned that some smaller lenders could go under as banks compete for deposits in a more open regime.\n\nEarlier this year, the central bank removed controls on lending rates.\n\n\"We will choose a time when conditions are ripe to lift controls on deposit rates, which we think is the final step of liberalising interest rates,\" PBOC vice-governor Hu Xiaolian told a forum in Beijing yesterday.\n\nThe reforms are aimed at helping Beijing engineer a shift in the giant economy away from investment- and exports-led growth to activity fuelled more by consumption and services. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

OpenNet also began to offer installation capacity on Saturdays. However, it takes time for OpenNet's contractor to increase installation capacity as they will need to hire and train new teams to ensure that the additional installation capacity is met.\"\n\nOpenNet has until the year-end to clean up its act in terms of QOS standards for its residential end-user connection services. IDA will once again size up OpenNet's performance in Q1 next year.\n\nAsked whether the deadline was feasible yesterday, OpenNet said that \"additional initiatives have been proposed to IDA and (are) currently under discussion\". \"Together with the quarterly adjustment to the installation capacity, we expect the QOS performance for residential connections to improve with these initiatives.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/latest-news-bloomberg-about-big-changes", "site_title": "The latest news from Bloomberg is about big changes", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nThe latest news from Bloomberg is about big changes\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Nov 20, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nMONDAY was a big day for layoffs over at Bloomberg, and Kara Bloomgarden-Smoke has the official memo from editor-in-chief Matt Winkler. In typical Bloomberg style, the defenestrations seem to be taking place in much the same way as they would on Wall Street, with reporters being escorted from the building, never to return. (Bloomberg has a formal policy that once you've left, even if your departure was not of your own choosing, you can't come back.)\n\nI received a phone call from one Bloomberg employee of very long standing who used terms like \"Lord of the Flies\" and \"culture of fear\"; he said that he had never seen anything like this during his long career at the company. Employees were even reportedly flocking to the local Starbucks to view the latest NMA video about Bloomberg News on their phones, because they didn't dare watch it on their work computers.\n\nIf you take a step back from the chaos, however, it's possible to see the beginnings of a deep change in how the Bloomberg newsroom is run. The message I'm getting from the layoffs is that Bloomberg is finally growing out of Winkler's insecurities, and is beginning to shape the newsroom into more of a means to an end, and less of an end in itself.\n\nTo understand what's going on, it's important to have a vague feel for where the power really lies within Bloomberg LP. Winkler is undoubtedly a powerful man - he oversaw the rise and rise of Bloomberg News, and he is a close confidante of Michael Bloomberg, co-writing his autobiography along the way. But while Winkler is powerful, he's no Tom Secunda.\n\nSecunda, a co-founder of the company, is the other Bloomberg billionaire, the man in charge of basically everything which makes money at Bloomberg. And Secunda is the opposite of a romantic press baron: all he's interested in is profitability.\n\nWinkler's enormous achievement, of building one of the world's foremost news organisations from scratch, required an aggressive, underdog spirit. Bloomberg News is a highly competitive organisation, and Winkler wanted to beat everybody, on everything, all the time. His goal for Bloomberg News was always that it be faster, broader, deeper, more accurate, more trustworthy - on every story, compared to every competitor.\n\nThat goal put Winkler at odds, to some degree, with Secunda, whose only priority is client service, and giving Bloomberg subscribers whatever they want. And it turns out that Bloomberg subscribers, although they definitely want market-moving news ahead of anybody else, are much less fussed about the broad mass of news stories which don't move markets.\n\nSo while Winkler was building up a substantial investigative journalism group, or creating the Bloomberg Muse franchise to cover the arts, Secunda was grumbling, asking why Bloomberg News needed to provide any of that kind of stuff. Couldn't Bloomberg subscribers find just as good content in such areas from the New York Times wire, if they needed it?\n\nThe answer, of course, was yes, but that was not an answer that Winkler ever wanted to hear: his competitive drive didn't end at actionable news. He wanted to win everything, all the way down to sporting results and book reviews.\n\nIn recent years, Winkler has been losing a bit of his former power. New areas of editorial - most obviously Bloomberg View and Bloomberg Businessweek - have been set up largely outside his purview: while he's nominally in charge of both, he has little actual control of either - as some of Businessweek's most notorious covers will attest. And then, this summer, the Atlantic's Justin Smith was hired to the newly-created job of Bloomberg Media CEO.\n\nSmith's main qualification for the job was that he took a company which was bleeding millions and turned it into a profitable, digitally-savvy news organisation. And while Bloomberg News doesn't have a profit mandate - its main job is to provide news to terminal clients, not to be profitable in its own right - it was clear that Smith was being charged with making the organisation rather less wasteful, and with ensuring that if Bloomberg was doing something, it was doing it for a good reason.\n\nThus was created a procedure which had never happened at Bloomberg News before. \"We evaluated everything we're doing,\" said Winkler, in his memo, \"to determine what's working and what isn't, with the single aim to ensure all we do has maximum impact\".\n\nNo more would Bloomberg News try to beat everyone on everything: from here on in, it would concentrate only on those areas where it could really move the needle.\n\nPut like that, it was pretty clear where layoffs would be coming. Bloomberg TV is watched by, to a first approximation, nobody - and loses more than US$100 million a year. Bloomberg Muse created some wonderful content, but, again, almost nobody read it - and it was hard to make a case that it was producing extraordinary material that no one else could equal.\n\nAs for the investigative unit - well, investigations are part and parcel of any serious news organisation, and Bloomberg News is nothing if not a serious news organisation. But again, the unit was looking bloated, it wasn't reaching a wide readership, and the terminal clients didn't much care about what it produced. If they weren't interested, then at the very least the investigations should have some kind of popular impact, and help to bolster the reputation of Bloomberg News within the global elite.\n\nThus did Smith give Josh Tyrangiel, the editor of Bloomberg Businessweek and one of the very few people inside Bloomberg News to have proven himself largely independent of Winkler, a broader remit, including pretty much all the problem areas: investigations, Bloomberg Muse, and - at least temporarily - Bloomberg TV.\n\nThe pruning was severe, just as it was when Tyrangiel took over Businessweek. But Winkler is clear that even after these cuts, Bloomberg News is going to have a greater headcount next year than it did before this week's firings. It's still growing: it just no longer feels the need to try to beat every other media organisation on things as peripheral to its terminal business as arts coverage and match reports.\n\nAll of this should make Secunda happy - while at the same time emphasising the fact that Smith and Tyrangiel now have a significant degree of control over a newsroom which used to belong solely and unambiguously to Winkler. And while the Winkler regime had its idiosyncrasies, it didn't pull its punches.\n\nNow, however, Bloomberg News is increasingly a direct threat to the success of Bloomberg LP, in a world where China represents the company's biggest growth opportunity and just one of the two things that Mike Bloomberg has declared to be in his \"long-range plans\" after his successor's inauguration as New York City mayor.\n\nThis is the downside of having Bloomberg News act as some kind of service provider to the terminal sales business: the terminal sales business clearly wants to minimise the impact of any critical news articles about China.\n\nAs Edward Wong of The New York Times reports: \"Editors at Bloomberg have long been aware of the need to tread carefully in China. A system has been in place that allows editors to add an internal pre-publication code to some articles to ensure that they do not appear on terminals in China, two employees said. This has been used regularly with articles on Chinese politics.\"\n\nThis is a textbook example of pulling punches: refusing to publish stories in exactly the country where they would serve the greatest purpose.

In last month's budget, Prime Minister Najib Razak doubled the minimum amount foreigners must spend on property and raised the capital gains tax to 30 per cent on homes they sell within five years.\n\nThe local governments of Johor state, where Iskandar is based, and Penang to the north, are considering additional tariffs on overseas buyers.\n\nWhile Horizon Hills surrounds a golf course and is luxurious by Malaysian standards, homes cost far less than in Singapore. Four-bedroom houses in the 487 hectare development, popular with expatriates, are advertised online at US$270 per square foot, compared with the US$503 per square foot asked for a four-bedroom public housing flat in Bishan.\n\nThe average price of a new 1,000-square-foot condominium in Singapore is between US$800,000 and US$960,000, according to London-based broker Savills.\n\nA similar-sized place in Kuala Lumpur costs about US$374,000, according to CBRE Group's Malaysian unit.\n\nSingapore has ramped up efforts to bring down housing costs with measures such as linking borrowers' maximum debt levels to their incomes, higher stamp duties and capital gains taxes. Home prices have still jumped 40 per cent to a record since the island-state started introducing curbs four years ago.\n\nThe gains led to Singapore being ranked the most-expensive city to buy a luxury home in Asia after Hong Kong by Knight Frank in a wealth report in March.\n\nThe difficulties of purchasing in Singapore have prompted potential buyers to explore Malaysia.\n\n\"Malaysia has certainly been the recipient of a lot of Singaporean money since the tighter cooling measures here,\" said Nicholas Holt, Knight Frank's Asia-Pacific research director. \"Singaporeans probably top the list in terms of overseas buyers in Malaysia, most notably in Iskandar, but also in Kuala Lumpur and Penang.\"\n\nThat's prompting Malaysia to act, joining Hong Kong and mainland China, in seeking to cool surging housing markets to help combat concerns over affordability and prevent a housing debacle from emerging in the financial system.\n\nMalaysia's central bank shortened the maximum length on mortgages in July, saying household indebtedness had risen by an average 12 per cent per annum in the past five years.\n\nLast month, the government barred developers from helping home buyers by absorbing some interest payments on loans.\n\nMalaysians have accumulated South-east Asia's highest level of household borrowings at 80.5 per cent of gross domestic product, according to Bank of America Corp's Merrill Lynch unit.\n\nB Shashikumar, a 32-year-old Malaysian bank manager, wants to buy a home before he gets married.\n\n\"Even with my RM5,000 (S$1,956) monthly salary, I can't buy a house in Kuala Lumpur or Selangor below RM300,000,\" said Mr Shashikumar, who typically spends three hours each day commuting to and from work in Malaysia's capital from Shah Alam, a city where he lives with his parents. \"I'll have to find one in another state. It's difficult to get high loans for a house in the city.\"\n\nAverage Malaysian home values rose 43 per cent to a record in the four-and-a-half-years to June, according to government data.\n\nPrices in Kuala Lumpur climbed 62 per cent to RM605,711 between the start of 2009 and the end of the second quarter this year, said CBRE, citing government data. They rose 49 per cent to RM298,697 in Penang and 37 per cent to RM187,644 in Johor during the same period, the data showed.\n\nCooling measures may slow home sales, according to consultants including CBRE and Knight Frank. \"The market is expected to self-correct in the next six to 12 months,\" said Judy Ong Mei-Chen, a Kuala Lumpur-based executive director at Knight Frank.\n\nIskandar, a development zone spanning 2,217 square kilometres, three times the size of Singapore, was started in 2006 to compete for manufacturing and logistics business with its neighbour in the south. It's aimed at piggy-backing on Singapore's economic rise, just as Guangdong gained from Hong Kong, by offering lower-cost alternatives to manufacturers, food processors and energy companies.\n\nResidential neighbourhoods featuring large homes, gardens and swimming pools, are being built.\n\nSpin-offs of foreign schools and universities are also opening, offering cheaper international-standard education than Singapore, including Britain's Marlborough College, where Mr Metcalf now sends his kids.\n\nSome high-profile projects, including the Legoland Malaysia amusement park and Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios - a franchise of the UK-based company where James Bond films were made - are done or nearing completion in a flagship development zone called Nusajaya.\n\nWealthier foreigners are encouraged to settle in the country under the government's Malaysia My Second Home Programme, which provides them with renewable 10-year multiple-entry social visit passes.\n\nAbout 77 per cent of the 22,709 people who have applied are from Asia, with the largest number of recent arrivals coming from China, government data showed.\n\nSingaporeans account for 70 per cent of overseas buyers in Malaysia, making them the largest group of foreign purchasers, Wan Abdullah Wan Ibrahim, chief executive officer of UEM Sunrise Bhd, told reporters on Nov 13.\n\nUEM, which is co-developing Horizon Hills with Gamuda Bhd, is the biggest landowner in Iskandar.\n\n\"The impact of the budget measures will be temporary,\" Mr Wan Abdullah said. \"Developers are very creative. We will find other means of attracting buyers.\"\n\nUEM, UOA Development and Mah Sing Group may post slower sales growth due to the cooling measures, K&N Kenanga Holdings said in a research note dated Oct 28, predicting a knee-jerk reaction to foreigners' appetite in the next few months.\n\nUEM shares have fallen 12 per cent since Mr Najib announced property cooling measures on Oct 25. UOA dropped 12 per cent and Mah Sing is down 9 per cent in the same period, underperforming a 0.5 decline in the benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index.\n\n\"Currently, Malaysia has a rather low number of foreign purchasers despite having one of the most accommodative environments for property investment in the region,\" Leong Hoy Kum, Mah Sing's group managing director, said in an e-mailed response. \"This means that should sales be slower, it may not have a very strong impact on the market in terms of pricing and sales volume.\"\n\nJohor is planning to impose an additional 2 per cent tariff on buyers from overseas across all segments of the property market from May, The Business Times of Malaysia reported, citing Koh Moo Hing, chairman of the Johor branch of the Real Estate and Housing Developers' Association.\n\nPenang is seeking public feedback on proposals to introduce a 3 per cent levy on foreigners purchasing homes next year, Lim Guan Eng, the state's chief minister, said last month.\n\n\"If I buy a property, I'm not going to buy it to speculate,\" Mr Metcalf said. \"I want to buy a house that I can live in and the kids can grow up in and that we can call home.

This is even though Marina South will be the last of the three areas to see work start.\n\nDevelopment is slated after 2017/2018, while Kampong Bugis may launch after 2016 and Holland Village by 2015.\n\n\"Marina South will be well received by investors ... as it will be near to CBD,\" said Ong Kah Seng, director at R'ST Research. \"Tenants, especially expatriates, need this convenience.\"\n\nThe 21.5 hectares of developable land at Marina South, part of the future Greater Southern Waterfront, will be a mixed-use residential district with the likes of 9,000 private homes and an underground mall.\n\nAlice Tan, head of research at Knight Frank Singapore, called the plans for Marina South, just off Gardens by the Bay, a \"well thought-through strategy\" by planners to construct high-quality recreational spaces first, similar to what was done in Punggol. This allows the initial investment into recreational facilities to enhance land value in the future.\n\nChia Siew Chuin, director of research and advisory at Colliers International, believes there will be an \"overall metamorphosis of an area currently devoid of vibrancy\" when work there is completed.\n\nKeppel Land's president (Singapore), Tan Swee Yiow, said Marina South \"will be the centrepiece of Singapore's urban transformation and add vibrancy to Singapore's New Downtown\".\n\nHe also sees the Greater Southern Waterfront as complementing efforts to transform Keppel Bay. Keppel Land is behind several projects in the broader area, including Marina Bay Financial Centre and Reflections at Keppel Bay.\n\nConsultants expect Kampong Bugis, near Kallang Riverside, to benefit from the upcoming completion of the Sports Hub next year, which will draw human traffic. The 18 ha of land to be developed at Kampong Bugis will result in about 4,000 private homes.\n\nThis should allow it to take off where Kallang Riverside, which had been a growth area identified in the previous Master Plan, could not.\n\nAs for Holland Village, analysts see interest from owner-occupiers attracted to the lifestyle area, expatriates on lower benefits, as well as from workers from the nearby one-north.\n\n\"It is a popular locale among the local and expatriate population and (is in) a prime location,\" said Lee Lay Keng, head of Singapore research at DTZ.\n\nThe six-hectare extension of Holland Village will feature a mixed-use development with an underground parking station and two residential sites. In all, about 1,500 new homes will be available.\n\nThe prevalence of mixed-use projects was a notable feature in the Draft Master Plan, a fact welcomed by CapitaLand, which has said its new focus will be on such developments.\n\n\"We will study the details and identify areas where we can leverage our multi-sectoral capabilities to add value to the locations earmarked for development,\" a spokesman for CapitaLand said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The acquisition is expected to be completed by Q4 2014.\n\nThe latest valuation of the property as at Nov 19, 2013, commissioned by CMA and conducted by CBRE Limited, is 2.2 billion yuan.\n\nTaking into account this valuation, the purchase consideration payable to Greenland Real Estate for the acquisition is 2.19 billion yuan.\n\nThe shopping mall is located at Baiyun Greenland Centre, an integrated development at the junction of Yuncheng West Road and Qixin Road within the core commercial centre of Baiyun New Town in Baiyun District.\n\nBaiyun District is the most populous district in Guangzhou with a population of more than 2.2 million. A number of companies are headquartered in Baiyun District, and Baiyun New Town is positioned as the new regional centre of northern Guangzhou.\n\nThe eight-storey shopping mall will have a total gross floor area, excluding car park, of about 86,000 square metres. It will be positioned as a shopping destination with a lifestyle supermarket, Cineplex, international and local fashion brands, as well as a wide range of food and beverage outlets.\n\nThe mall will also be connected to the Baiyun Park subway station on Line 2, making it the only shopping mall in Baiyun New Town that is directly connected to a subway station.\n\nIt is targeted to open in phases from 2014.\n\nLim Beng Chee, CMA's CEO, said he is confident about growth prospects of the retail sector. \"This new mall in Guangzhou will mark our strategic entry into a first-tier city in South China. We will leverage on our established team in South China, which has been in Guangdong Province since 2005, to manage the new mall.\"\n\nHe said the acquisition was part of CMA's strategy to selectively expand its footprint in China, while strengthening its presence in the cities and regions it is already in.\n\nIncluding this development, CMA now has 62 shopping malls in 37 cities in China, of which 51 are operational while the other 11 are under development.\n\nThe counter closed three cents lower at $2.01 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/hedge-accounting-sees-substantial-overhaul", "site_title": "Hedge accounting sees substantial overhaul", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nHedge accounting sees substantial overhaul\n\nNew model enables firms to better reflect risk-management activities: IASB chief\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Nov 20, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] The much-awaited new hedge-accounting model, released by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in the UK on Tuesday, represents a substantial overhaul of hedge accounting - arguably the most complex accounting standard out there.\n\nIASB chairman Hans Hoogervorst said: \"This is a significant change in accounting that enables companies to better reflect their risk-management activities (and) has received strong support from corporates around the world.\"\n\nThe new model was drawn up in response to concerns raised by preparers of financial statements about the difficulty of understanding and applying hedge-accounting rules.\n\nMr Hoogervorst said: \"It makes it easier for (entities) to really show their activities to minimise their economic risk. It takes out the mathematical bright lines in current hedge accounting and retraces them with more qualitative criteria. It's more principle-based and will therefore be easier to retain hedge accounting.\"\n\nChen Voon Hoe, Singapore Accounting Advisory leader at PwC Singapore, said he believes the IASB has tried very hard to address the issues surrounding hedge accounting: \"To me, the most notable achievement is that this new hedging standard actually simplifies the accounting for hedging transactions. Most of the proposed new standards or amendments tend to introduce greater complexity to accounting.\"\n\nHedge accounting is a method of accounting in which entries for the ownership of a security and the opposing hedge are treated as one with the aim of reducing the volatility created by the repeated adjustment of a financial instrument's value.\n\nThe new model for doing this is part of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which will replace IAS 39. The IASB was pushed to review IAS 39 in the wake of the global financial crisis, after policymakers criticised fair-value accounting for amplifying the credit crunch.\n\nIts chapter on hedge accounting aligns the accounting more closely with risk management, and improves the related disclosures. It also makes improvements to the reporting of changes in the fair value of an entity's own debt contained in IFRS 9 more readily available.\n\nWard Coombs, assurance partner in Financial Services at EY, said: \"The new model is significantly different in the approach taken and in the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Under the new standard, entities that did not apply hedge accounting in the past due to the administration burden now have a way to proceed in applying hedge accounting.\"\n\nThe most significant improvements apply to those that hedge non-financial risk. Previously, hedge accounting could not be applied to components of non-financial items and groups of items, so businesses could not show in their financial statements the fact that they were entering into derivatives for hedge-accounting purposes.\n\nOng Pang Thye, who heads Audit at KPMG in Singapore, pointed out: \"Airlines, shipping and other industries that have to manage significant commodity price exposures will have the most to gain from the new ability to apply hedge accounting for risk components of non-financial items.\n\n\"A company will be able to reflect in its financial statements an outcome that is more consistent with how management assesses and mitigates risks for key inputs into its core business.\"\n\nMr Chen said: \"The new standard removes the rigid 80 per cent to 125 per cent effectiveness testing requirements, allowing a greater flexibility to designate a component of non-financial instruments, deferring time value and forward points of options and forwards.\n\n\"This translates to a broad-based improvement for a wide range of companies for those with simple foreign-exchange forwards to those with more complex commodity hedges. This will result in wider adoption of hedge accounting and reduced volatility.\"\n\nStill, there will be challenges. Mr Ong said: \"More may have to be done to guide organisations in implementing this new standard. Significant effort may be needed to analyse the requirements of this new standard and determine how best to apply them to a company's particular circumstances.\"\n\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) said the new standard will require more disclosures because it is more principles-based than the standard it replaces.\n\nNigel Sleigh-Johnson, head of ICAEW's Financial Reporting Faculty, said: \"More judgment means an increased need for disclosures. That may be a challenge for some. What is critical is that the longer disclosures don't result in key information becoming obscured.\"\n\nAs for how and when this will affect Singapore, experts say the Accounting Standards Council (ASC), which sets standards here, is likely to wait for the IASB's completion of the entire IFRS 9 project before adopting the standard here.\n\nThe IASB is continuing to consider limited amendments to the classification and measurement requirements already included in IFRS 9 and is working on finalising the new expected credit loss impairment model. It has therefore removed the Jan 1, 2015, mandatory effective date for the standard.\n\nMr Coombs said: \"It may be difficult for the ASC to consider adoption without first understanding the final impairment guidelines that will be released in future.

It has an average price of US$120,000 psm, or US$11,148 psf.\n\nThe mountain has long been the stomping ground of Hong Kong's super-rich, and chic new developments on this winding path have pushed prices up by 10 per cent over the past year.\n\nOne of these was Skyhigh, a development at number 10-18 Pollock's Path and developed by Hong Kong celebrity Stephen Chow.

The safety offered is enough of a draw that the companies are tackling cultural differences and unfamiliar approval processes, and at times accepting lower returns.\n\nIn the United States, the six biggest metropolitan areas have attracted US$2.88 billion in commercial real estate investment by Chinese companies this year, up from US$321 million in all of 2012, according to New York-based research firm Real Capital Analytics Inc. The data include both completed and pending transactions. Manhattan and other New York City boroughs were the two biggest areas for deals, with Los Angeles third.\n\nThe Chinese are adding to a wave of investment in top markets by buyers including sovereign wealth funds, real estate investment trusts and private equity firms. In the six major US metro areas, commercial property prices reached a five-year high in August, the latest month for which figures are available, and are up 6.2 per cent this year, according to Moody's Investors Service and Real Capital Analytics.\n\nIn exchange for relative safety, Shanghai-based Chiway Holding Group Co is prepared to settle for an internal rate of return of about 15 per cent on US projects, less than the 30 per cent to 50 per cent more common in China, chairman Jianrong Qian said in Los Angeles, the first stop on a tour organised by the China Real Estate Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\"These types of returns are going to end in China too,\" said Mr Qian, whose company has built about 12 million square metres of mostly residential buildings in eastern Chinese cities including Shanghai. \"They will have to level out at some point. But it's hard to predict, and it makes business-planning for the future difficult in China.\"\n\nGreenland Holding Group Co, the Shanghai-based builder of one of China's tallest towers, has emerged as one of the largest Chinese investors in the US. In October, the company signed a memorandum of understanding to buy a 70 per cent share of Brooklyn's US$5 billion Atlantic Yards project. Greenland's investment in the nine-hectare development, which was approved in 2006 and has been delayed in part by the recession, involves 14 apartment buildings and one office property.\n\n\"The trend for Chinese companies going abroad has just started,\" Greenland chairman Zhang Yuliang said in Shanghai. The company's projects include four of the world's 10 tallest buildings, and it has developments in more than 80 Chinese cities.\n\nGreenland is providing funding for the Atlantic Yards project while Forest City Ratner Cos, the site's original developer, will manage the day-to-day tasks. Such an arrangement is common for Chinese developers seeking US partners to navigate the local building processes and cultural differences.\n\nThe Chinese \"realise it's more efficient to have a local partner\", Mr Gaw said. \"The ones who try to do it on their own will have the hardest time. It's not financial but a cultural problem.\"\n\nIn San Francisco, China Vanke Co, the nation's biggest publicly traded developer, has teamed with New York-based Tishman Speyer Properties LP to develop the 655-unit Lumina high-rise towers in the South of Market area. Vanke, based in Shenzhen, has the majority equity position in the US$620 million complex, while Tishman is the developer and project manager.\n\nThe companies have discussed possible sites for a second high-rise housing project in the city, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Tishman is trying to assemble parking lots into a large parcel for the construction site, and is negotiating with San Francisco officials because some of the lots are owned by the city, said one of the people.\n\nIn Los Angeles, developer Joseph Moinian is selling a 1.8 ha site designated for a retail, hotel and residential complex with a potential value of US$900 million. The land sits near the Staples Center, the downtown arena where the Lakers basketball team plays, and is a few blocks south of a site where Greenland agreed to buy a US$1 billion stake in a 2.4 ha apartment, hotel and office development.\n\nMr Moinian said he's received five \"serious\" bids, more than one of which was from Chinese investors. \"Investors see the potential of a development site such as ours,\" said Mr Moinian, chief executive officer of New York-based Moinian Group. \"Chinese tend to have a longer investment horizon, so this is very attractive to them.\"\n\nOffshore investments by Chinese developers are being fuelled in part by the government's tacit endorsement through a \"hands off\" approach, Mr Gaw said. \"The fact that the government hasn't stepped in and stopped any of these deals is also a message\" that Chinese companies can continue building internationally, he said.\n\nIn 2009, China loosened rules governing local companies' direct investments overseas, broadening the types of funding allowed and scrapping other rules to help them seize opportunities with lower investment costs, according to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. \"The government hasn't gone as far as actually giving incentives to developers like us for investing abroad, but they have relaxed the restrictions and made it easier,\" Mr Qian said.\n\nWhile limitations on developments abroad have loosened, curbs at home have been helping drive Chinese developers to seek opportunities in places such as the US.\n\nChina's government has instated limits on homebuying as a way of cooling the booming market. In September, new-home prices in the country's four biggest cities jumped the most since January 2011, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Oct 22.\n\nIn an attempt to slow the increases, China's government is limiting members of one family to owning no more than two homes in major cities such as Beijing, restricting mortgage lending and enforcing 20 per cent capital gains rules on some sales, according to Omer Ozden, managing partner of the private equity unit of Beijing Capital, whose investments include real estate overseas. The rules have prompted some people to get divorced or enter \"fake\" marriages to circumvent the limits, he said.\n\nEven stricter rules are expected at the end of the year, including guidance from the government on how high builders may price residential units, Mr Ozden said. Developers and investors are responding to the restrictions by seeking deals elsewhere.\n\n\"It is cooling demand and limiting the pace of growth for Chinese real estate developers,\" Mr Ozden said. \"Even though the demand is still there, even though people still want to buy, the government is imposing restrictions to slow things down.\"\n\nLast year, in a separate advisory role, Mr Ozden represented Beijing-based residential developer Xinyuan Real Estate Co in its acquisition of waterfront land in Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighbourhood for the construction of 216 condominiums.\n\nIn cities such as New York, Chinese developers are betting on rising demand from the increasing number of wealthy Chinese seeking property outside their own country, including homes for children studying abroad, according to Mr Ozden and Mr Qian. Xinyuan's project, called the Oosten - the Dutch word for east - is scheduled to begin construction by the end of the year, and is expected to have a \"significant\" number of pre-sales to buyers who live in China once marketing begins, Mr Ozden said.\n\nIt isn't as common for US developers to invest in real estate in China, said Gregory Karns, a Los Angeles-based lawyer at Cox, Castle & Nicholson LLP, who has been advising Chinese companies for more than two decades.\n\nPrologis Inc, the world's biggest owner of industrial real estate, on Nov 11 said it would form a venture to build and buy properties in the country. The venture, the San Francisco-based company's second in China, has an investment capacity of more than US$1 billion, including US$588 million of committed equity.\n\n\"There are certainly US firms investing in Chinese real estate, but it's less so than the Chinese investing here,\" Mr Karns said. \"For one, it's easier to invest in US property than in China. Essentially, all you need is money. But there is also a higher level of certainty in the US.\"\n\nThe surge in Chinese real estate development overseas is reminiscent of the Japanese wave of property investments in the US and other countries in the 1980s, which included purchases of New York's Rockefeller Center and California's Pebble Beach golf course. While the push for globalisation and diversification by investors is similar, the timing is quite different, according to Mr Karns.\n\n\"The Japanese set the top of the market and kept pushing it higher and higher,\" he said. \"Just like with the Chinese today, there was this push to internationalise investments. But what's working in the Chinese favour is that the US is coming out of a real estate recession, so prices are better.\"\n\nJapan's relatively small population and declining economy at the time of its US real estate expansion ultimately undermined the overseas investments - untrue of China and its investors, said Mr Zhang.\n\nForeign expansion by Chinese builders shows no signs of cooling. Vanke plans to increase its overseas investments to 20 per cent of development spending from 5 per cent today, with a focus on cities that have been attractive to Chinese for decades, such as San Francisco, New York and Boston, according to chairman Wang Shi.\n\nOutside the US, the UK and Australia's largest cities also are attracting Chinese developers, according to Meisheng Nie, founder of the China Real Estate Chamber of Commerce, a 5,000-\n\nmember organisation focused on growth in the property sector. Greenland Holding is seeking projects in Australia and hopes to invest more than A$1 billion (S$1.7 billion) in the country, mostly in Sydney and Melbourne, in the next two years, Mr Zhang said.\n\nThe company plans to construct 1,000 apartments on a Melbourne site and expects to open a five-star, 180-room hotel in Sydney by 2015, Sherwood Luo, managing director of Greenland Australia, said last week.\n\nIn Europe, investments have totalled US$3.82 billion this year, more than triple the amount spent in all of 2012, with London and Brussels topping the list of targeted cities, according to Real Capital Analytics.\n\nBeijing Construction Engineering Group Co last month said it formed a venture with Manchester Airports Group and other partners to build an international business district in the second-biggest UK city.

It really is stock picking, and we would expect that to continue next year.\"\n\nSome broad themes are gaining close to consensus status as 2014 approaches: The US and Japanese economies are picking up steam, but recoveries in those markets are still fragile. Europe is also getting glimpses of life, though deflation continues to threaten some of the peripheral economies.\n\n\"The eurozone overall continues to struggle,\" Schroders economist Azad Zangana said recently at the firm's international media conference in London.\n\nIn Asia, concerns about a China slowdown are balanced by confidence in restructuring efforts and by the fact that even a slower China is still growing at a robust clip.\n\nSouth-east Asia, however, is facing a threat of capital outflows as developed markets improve, while the overperformance from previous years dulls the region's attractiveness on a relative basis.\n\nThose broad themes form starting points, but asset managers stressed that the outlook remains highly sensitive to a large number of factors - when US tapering occurs, for example, and at what pace is anyone's guess - and there will be winners and losers. Figuring out how to tell them apart is therefore the challenge for next year.\n\nOne popular filter at the moment is income, with fund managers expressing a preference for dividend-paying stocks.\n\nBut the income play is shifting from traditional yield instruments, such as bonds and real estate investment trusts (Reits), towards more growth, such as dividend-paying cyclical equities.\n\n\"In a rising interest rate environment, we still recommend income products to our clients, but we are changing the complexion of the underlying investments,\" Mr Pulling said. \"We can find stocks in sectors that have high yields, but also have better growth prospects. So maybe the yield is not as secure as the yield in, say, a Reit, but the growth of the dividend might be stronger.\"\n\nMr Pulling said that stocks in cyclicals, financials and materials, in particular, are where value can still be found. And he prefers North Asia to South-east Asia, partly because valuations in Singapore and its neighbouring countries remain elevated compared to markets such as China and Korea.\n\nIn the United States, Schroders portfolio manager of US large-cap equities, Joanna Shatney, said that healthcare and industrials looked interesting because of valuations, demographics and expectations of increased capital expenditures.\n\nMs Shatney believed that the year-long US equity rally still had legs. Slow economic growth should keep the Federal Reserve dovish for longer, while margin multipliers could amplify US corporate earnings improvements.\n\n\"I'm not a believer that margins have peaked . . . There are still, if you look by sector, opportunities for margins to go up, and to be honest I don't have an official margin forecast for next year, but we think that 4 per cent topline growth can be leveraged into 200 to 300 basis points for operating income growth,\" Ms Shatney said.\n\nThe stock-picking strategy also applies to Europe, where Schroders European equities fund manager Martin Skanberg is taking a bottoms-up approach.\n\nAn accommodative central bank and drastically improved availability of credit are all supportive of economic growth, and many eurozone countries have become more competitive in the wake of the region's financial crisis, Mr Skanberg said.\n\nValuations are also extremely cheap, with price-earnings multiples far below historical averages.\n\n\"This has been historically the best predictive tool towards future returns and it looks mildly supportive for next year,\" Mr Skanberg said.\n\nBusinesses leveraged to the domestic economy of Europe, such as telecommunications, offer some of the best value at the moment, and non-periphery banks have become investible as well.\n\nThe challenge in bargain hunting is avoiding value traps, where cheap multiples accurately reflect a business' limitations rather than over-pessimism.\n\nAn investment assessment must therefore combine valuation with a view on whether there is a catalyst that will unlock the mispriced value.\n\n\"Why do we need to own this stock now? What is the inflection point?\" Mr Skanberg said.\n\n\"Because the risk is that you find all these cheap stocks, and they're value traps, or they're like the telco sector that's been underperforming for six years. You need to ask yourself why now . . . We're looking for a new management team, we're looking for a cost restructuring programme, we're looking for an acquisition, we're looking for a disposal.

This is assuming that OUE Bayfront is sold for the minimum price, OUE said in a circular to shareholders yesterday.\n\nOUE Bayfront is one of two assets that will form the initial portfolio of OUE C-Reit. OUE had previously also said that it will inject the 50-year leasehold Lippo Plaza, which is located in Shanghai, into the Reit.\n\nOUE's tenure for the 36-storey office and retail Lippo Plaza started in 1994. The building has a net lettable area (NLA) of 422,290 sq ft.\n\nIn its circular, OUE said that the Reit will also have first right of refusal to acquire three of OUE's commercial properties.

Known as the tallest building in California, the US Bank Tower has a NLA of 1.4 million sq ft.\n\nThe other two properties are OUE's 40.8 per cent interest in office and retail development, One Raffles Place, which has an NLA of 862,001 sq ft, and OUE Downtown 2 and Downtown Gallery - which has an NLA of 603,016 sq ft.\n\nOUE said that it expects to hold 40 per cent of units in OUE C-Reit. \"Depending on the final offering structure, the group may hold up to 50 per cent of the units,\" it added.\n\nMedia reports quoting sources had said previously that OUE C-Reit could raise up to $700 million through its initial public offering in the first quarter of next year.\n\nOUE will be holding an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) on Dec 4, 2013, for shareholders to vote on the sale of OUE Bayfront to OUE C-Reit.\n\nThe development has an overall NLA of 402,374 sq ft, with three components: the 99-year leasehold OUE Bayfront, which is an 18-storey premium office building with rooftop restaurant premises, and ancillary properties, 99-year leasehold OUE Tower - a conserved building currently occupied by a fine dining restaurant - OUE Link, a link bridge with retail units which has a 15-year leasehold title that started in 2010.\n\nIn FY2012, the property delivered net property income of $35.4 million.\n\nBased on the valuation of OUE Bayfront by Cushman & Wakefield VHS as at Sept 30, 2013, the property is valued at $1.01 billion on an \"as-is\" basis and at $1.04 billion after taking into account income support.\n\nThe EGM will also see OUE put to vote a proposal to distribute to its shareholders one stapled trust it currently holds in its hospitality Reit, OUE H-Trust, for every six OUE shares held on the books closure date.\n\nThis will be done in proportion to stakeholders' shareholdings in OUE.\n\nThe distribution will hinge on whether shareholders pass the resolution to sell OUE Bayfront, it said.\n\n\"In the event that shareholders do not approve Resolution 1 (the sale of OUE Bayfront), the company will not proceed with Resolution 2 (the distribution of OUE H-Trust stapled securities).\n\n\"Should the shareholders not vote in favour of the proposed disposal, the company will not be able to avail itself of the cash proceeds, and may have to find other means of raising the same funds, including selling the company-held OUE H-Trust stapled securities instead of distributing them to shareholders.\"\n\nPart of the proceeds raised from the OUE Bayfront sale will go towards paying down debt of US$376.6 million.\n\nIf both resolutions pass, OUE's proposed distribution of OUE H-Trust stapled securities will amount to about $133.5 million, based on 151.7 million company-held OUE H-Trust stapled securities valued at 88 cents each.\n\nThis translates into a dividend of about 15 cents per share - based on the total number of issued shares in OUE, said the group.\n\nThe distribution represents about 25.6 per cent of the stapled securities OUE holds in its hospitality Reit, OUE H-Trust. This is about 11.6 per cent of the total number of stapled securities in OUE H-Trust.\n\nOUE \"intends to retain approximately 33 to 35 per cent of the total number of OUE H-Trust stapled securities in issue\" after the distribution, it added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The two-year two billion yuan (S$408 million) bonds priced at 3.2 per cent on Tuesday night received orders hitting 5.2 billion yuan.\n\nThe issue by ICBC Singapore branch, wholly owned by ICBC, China's largest bank, scored several firsts. It is the first Chinese entity to issue a yuan bond cleared in Singapore.\n\nAt two billion yuan, it is also the biggest deal. So far, yuan bond issuances by DBS Bank, United Overseas Bank and HSBC were for 500 million yuan each while Standard Chartered's was one billion yuan.\n\nSingapore investors took up 55 per cent, Hong Kong investors, 43 per cent, and those from other markets, 2 per cent. By industry, banks and corporates were allocated 25 per cent each, while fund managers got 35 per cent and private banks, 15 per cent.\n\n\"Future bond sales will depend on business growth,\" said Zhang Weiwu, ICBC Singapore branch general manager, yesterday.\n\nICBC Singapore began yuan clearing operations at the end of May. It is also celebrating its 20th anniversary here, along with the official opening of a private banking hub and upgraded full-banking service branches. It has three outlets in Singapore.\n\nThe bank's business has grown rapidly, and it plans to open more branches in Singapore next year, said Mr Zhang.\n\nSixty-six local and foreign banks have opened yuan clearing accounts with the branch, contributing a clearing volume as much as 1.7 trillion yuan. Its first month of clearing was 60 billion yuan which has risen to around 500 billion yuan per month, he said.\n\nThe bank also launched a wide range of yuan products covering retail banking, funds settlement, trade finance, global cash management and capital market.\n\nIn the first 10 months of this year, it recorded over 120 billion yuan of cross-border settlement volume, over 26 billion yuan in assets and over 11 billion yuan in deposits.\n\n\"Our three-year strategy is leveraging on our RMB strength to become the RMB preferred bank,\" said Mr Zhang.\n\nNext year, the target is to increase RMB assets to 60 per cent of total assets from 45 per cent today, and to 70 per cent after three years, he said.\n\nAs for cross-border settlement volume, he expects that it will hit 140 billion yuan by year-end and over 200 billion yuan next year.\n\nOn yuan-bond sales by corporates in Singapore, Mr Zhang said that with the pace of yuan internationalisation picking up, more companies will have yuan funding needs.\n\nThe bank is targeting to handle bond sales by Singapore corporates as well as multinationals that have treasury headquarters here, he said.\n\nAs the yuan continues to strengthen, and given China's economic clout as the world's second-largest economy, more and more corporates are settling in the Chinese currency.\n\nInvestors, too, are piling in on yuan products, betting on its strong fundamentals.\n\nDBS said that it has grown yuan corporate loans by over 140 per cent to 46 billion yuan as at Sept 30, 2013. DBS's yuan deposits rose by 8 per cent to 38 billion yuan as at Sept 30, 2013.\n\nThis year, the yuan has been the best-performing Asian currency, up over 2 per cent against the US dollar and 4 per cent against the Singapore dollar.\n\nThe yuan is expected to appreciate further next year, up 3.4 per cent by the third quarter, according to Derek Halpenny, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ European head of global markets research.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

COE bids for certain categories, including Cat A, are valid for six months.\n\nFrom February, the COE system will be recategorised to include an additional criterion relating to engine power.\n\nWhile the Land Transport Authority (LTA) will keep the existing engine-capacity criterion for Cat A (1,600cc and under), it will limit engine power to 130 brake horsepower (bhp). This means certain makes of cars now in Cat A will be pushed into Cat B from February.\n\nDemand for Cat B COEs has continued to slip, with buyers hesitant to make their move, given that the overall economy and stock market performance has been less than rosy, Mr Lim said.\n\nHe added that the new financing restrictions will also be a dampener, as a bigger capital outlay is needed when buying a car.\n\nEarlier this year, stricter car-financing measures and a tiered car-tax structure were introduced, with the aim of discouraging over-leveraging and cooling the demand for vehicles. For instance, loan quantums for cars with an Open Market Value (OMV) of above $20,000 have been capped at 50 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, the COE for commercial vehicles and buses is thought to have bottomed out at the $55,000 mark.\n\nPremiums for the category have corrected after rising in recent months amid the rush to register Euro 4 diesel vehicles before the tougher Euro 5 emission standards kick in come January.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The rest of the space will be leased out later.\n\nThe new showroom more than doubles Hafary's existing showroom space, to about 30,000 square feet.\n\nIt is targeted at retail customers, who account for about 60 to 70 per cent of the company's business, Mr Low said.\n\n\"We feel that it's time to put up something really good, to provide this level of service to them,\" he said. \"If you look around other showrooms in Singapore, you cannot find anything comparative.\"\n\nBut Hafary could be putting more resources into a challenged market.\n\nCIMB property analyst Donald Chua said private residential property volumes have fallen significantly from a year ago. Although Build-To-Order public flats could provide some support over the next few years, \"incrementally we're seeing more and more of this demand getting soaked up already\" as well.\n\nMr Low acknowledged that the housing market is facing some headwinds, but felt that public housing supply in the next few years should provide some resilience.\n\n\"If you look at the direction of the HDB in the next five years . . . we will see the business supply,\" Mr Low said.\n\nHafary is also not restricting itself to Singapore. The company has operations in China, where the company will be doing some trading. It also has a business venture in Vietnam, where the weak economy has actually made it easier for a newcomer to gain a foothold, Mr Low said.\n\n\"In the next one to two years we should see the Vietnam side picking up,\" he said. \"When times are not so good, it's easier to penetrate the market; when times are good nobody, wants to partner you. . . We went in with a long-term view.\"\n\nMr Low said Hafary's multi-pronged strategy within the same industry should put the company on solid ground. \"We are actually growing all sections,\" he said.\n\nHafary shares closed at 23 cents, up by half a cent or 2.2 per cent, yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And we don't like anyone talking about it not being around,\" Emirates airline president Tim Clark told Reuters an interview. \"I want to make this absolutely clear, to Airbus and the EADS board, that we are here for the long term. We will take more if we can, we have demonstrated that.\"\n\nEmirates already dominated the A380 backlog with a total of 90 ordered out of 259 since it was launched in 2000. After the new deal it has 140, or almost half the planes on order.\n\nYet some other airlines have cancelled or deferred as they worry whether they can fill the giant jet in tough economic times. Industry analysts say doubts have grown over whether as many as 30 further aircraft will be delivered as planned.\n\n\"I've been very vocal with the Airbus management, saying don't bottle out of this . . . it's a really good aircraft,\" Mr Clark said.\n\nSunday's deal galvanised an already dramatic start to the Dubai Airshow, coming on top of US$100 billion in orders for a new Boeing jet including 150 for Emirates.\n\nIt also ended a dearth of orders for Europe's iconic double-decker jet. The apparent shortage of demand had fuelled internal discussion over whether to cut production and review A380 strategy, as Reuters reported last month.\n\n\"We were aware of it. But that was not the reason why we did this deal,\" Mr Clark added. \"We wouldn't place orders of this size if we were concerned about it.\"\n\nThe new agreement was sealed in less than a week. \"They (Airbus) knew nothing about it until Monday last week. We gave them a call and said we want these airplanes and this is how we want to do it,\" Mr Clark said. \"At the time, they were having issues with regard to what to actually do, slow production rate maybe.\"\n\nMr Clark said he had always considered Emirates would need at least another 25 or 30 A380s for its fleet. \"So what we then did was to re-examine the real estate at the Dubai International Airport and see how we could use every trick in the book\" to fit in more planes.\n\n\"When we did that study, the magic number came up. So we said, let's have them in,\" he said, adding, \"we could have done another 10 if we found another bit of space somewhere in the field\".\n\nAirbus officials said there had been preparatory talks for a few months, but confirmed that last week had seen a step-up in the pace of negotiations. Industry sources said the carrier had at first looked at something closer to 20-25 jets.\n\nThe sale does not immediately resolve a problem of what to do with an estimated five A380 aircraft remaining to be sold in 2015, for which the first parts must soon be ordered.\n\nThe unallocated planes are worth some US$2 billion at current list prices, most of which is usually paid on delivery.\n\nEmirates is unlikely to take delivery of those planes since they do not fit its schedule for introducing a complex new in-flight entertainment system, which must be planned well ahead.\n\nAirbus has said it needs to deliver 30 aircraft in 2015 to meet its target of breaking even on the jet that year, but that any shortfall would not have a significant impact on profits. However, it could have a stronger impact on EADS' cashflow.\n\nEmirates and Airbus both expect traffic to grow fast enough in coming years to prove the A380's worth, but increasingly share an interest in ensuring the project succeeds.\n\nBoeing says airlines prefer twin-engined planes like its new type of 777.\n\n\"We believe business will come,\" Mr Clark said, adding Emirates was already detecting signs of recovery in Europe.\n\n\"You have to fill it. Time will demonstrate that you can fill the 500-seater. I can name 10 airlines today that I'm convinced can fill the airplanes, who are not operators of the 380.\" - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The company, which helped Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co build factories in Thailand, plans to spend about 40 billion baht over five years to boost its property, utilities and power businesses.\n\n\"They can receive a substantial amount of funds at one time from the sale of assets into the funds, allowing them to avoid increasing leverage from bank loans,\" Korawut Leenabanchong, chief investment officer at UOB Asset Management, which oversees about US$6 billion of assets, said.\n\nMr Charoen, Thailand's richest person, plans to raise about 32 billion baht from a fund backed by revenue from 12 Thai hotels, Somchai Boonnamsiri, chief executive officer of Krung Thai Asset Management Co, the fund's manager, said on Nov 15. Mr Dhanin's CP Land Co plans to raise about 10 billion baht with a fund backed by 30-year rental rights of three office buildings, said Mr Somchai, who will also manage that fund.\n\n\"A property fund would give us a new financing source,\" Mr Nardone said, adding that MFC Asset Management Pcl will oversee the fund. \"The offering should have no problem as investors are very interested.\"\n\nThe sales may test investor appetite for Thai assets after a resurgence of political unrest in the country. Overseas investors have pulled a net US$4.1 billion out of Thai equities so far this year, the most among South-east Asian markets, and the benchmark SET Index has retreated 4.5 per cent in the past month, making it Asia's worst performer, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\"Property funds give investors a way to diversify away from risky equity investments,\" UOB Asset's Mr Korawut said, declining to say whether he would invest in Hemaraj's fund. \"Still, investors will be more cautious and selective with more property funds expected to come to the market.\"\n\nThai real estate funds have provided an annual yield of about 7 per cent, according to Krung Thai Asset's Mr Somchai. The country's five largest banks offer an average annual interest rate of 1.63 per cent on three-month fixed deposits, according to central bank data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe country's 44 property funds have a combined market value of 243.7 billion baht, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe Thailand Property Fund Index has fallen 6.8 per cent this year after gaining 32 per cent in 2012. The SET Index has risen 1.9 per cent this year, and rallied 36 per cent in 2012.\n\nHemaraj's profit may increase at least 10 per cent next year on rising demand for industrial land and higher earnings from its power units, Mr Nardone said. Net income doubled to 826.8 million baht in the first nine months of 2013, from 408 million baht in the same period a year earlier.\n\nHemaraj operates six industrial estates on Thailand's east coast in Rayong, 146 km south east of Bangkok, and one in Saraburi province, covering a total land area of 6,313 ha, according to its website.\n\nThai property funds mobilise capital by issuing unit trusts and then investing the fund in real estate, according to the Stock Exchange of Thailand's website. They are required to invest at least 75 per cent of their net asset value in real estate or leasehold rights in Thai property. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/stiff-competition-muddies-water", "site_title": "Stiff competition muddies the water", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nStiff competition muddies the water\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Nov 20, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nMORE Singapore-listed players fighting for a slice - even crumbs - of the lucrative water treatment business pie in China have created a \"bubble\" amid intensified competition and squeezed margins for Chinese water projects.\n\nIn the latest quarterly results, a handful of such Singapore-listed companies suffering lower revenues and earnings cited factors that include fierce competition, higher financing costs and rising foreign worker wages.\n\nForeign companies have been piling into the Chinese water market after the country vowed to invest 430 billion yuan (S$87.3 billion) in the sector over the 12th five-year plan period from 2011 to 2015 - 17 per cent more than the previous period. Of this, two-fifths are earmarked for wastewater and sludge treatment facilities.\n\nPrivate companies, both domestic and foreign, have been welcomed to participate. This was a significant shift from a time when the water industry was run by Chinese state-owned enterprises. Severe fresh water shortage and growing pollution due to rapid urbanisation proved too much for them to handle.\n\nSo, what was once a hot industry is now hurting some players. Competition has led to lower utilisation of constructed treatment plants, translating into lower revenue and earnings for many companies there.\n\nThe Singapore firms with footprints in China also face another kind of competition at home, where newcomers are starting to enter the water treatment arena with maiden water deals.\n\nThis year has seen engineering cum real estate group Tee International agreeing to evaluate a possible acquisition of a wastewater treatment plant in Huzhou, China. The company has also formed a consortium which won a contract to manage the water level at the Makkasan Water Catchment area in Thailand.\n\nSystems integrator CNA Group also signed a concession deal with the Dongying Economic and Technological Development Zone of Dongying City in Shandong province, China, in the industrial wastewater treatment sector.\n\nLast year, specialist relocater Chasen Holdings signed a deal for a transfer-operate-transfer project involving a purified water treatment plant and a wastewater treatment plant in Jilin, China. Engineering firm Tritech Group also clinched a deal to provide a system to monitor the pollution levels along India's River Ganges.\n\nNRA Capital analyst Jacky Lee explains it as \"a diversification into a new non-core segment for some recurring income, so that the numbers from their construction works and turnkey projects alone don't look so volatile\".\n\n\"The water treatment business for companies big and small now is still profitable, though not very. The return of investment for wastewater management is very low because of the competition, but it's stable income and low-risk business for the company.\"\n\nLatest company earnings further confirm the dimming outlook in the sector.\n\nFor the period ended Sept 30, 2013, Sembcorp Industries' net profit from its water product segment fell 23 per cent to $16.5 million from a year ago, even as turnover climbed 7 per cent to $124.2 million. Overall, the conglomerate still scored stellar profits thanks to huge gains from the initial public offering of its Salalah company in Oman.\n\nSound Global's net profit also fell 24 per cent to 115.4 million yuan, hit by higher finance costs, while revenue dipped slightly to 766.9 million yuan.\n\nThe Chinese wastewater treatment firm, also listed in Hong Kong, is looking to delist, reportedly to consolidate all its shares onto one platform in the hope that the increased liquidity will allow its shares to rerate. Its counter has been trading at a 50-per-cent discount to peers' valuation in Hong Kong, said JPMorgan.\n\nMost of the higher finance costs reported by companies were due to new bonds and notes issuances, interest payouts on earlier issued bonds, as well as overall higher borrowings to finance their investment in water assets, which can be hefty. Meanwhile, lending rates in China have also risen from a year ago: the Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (Shibor) averaged 3.2564 per cent in the third quarter this year, compared to 2.7903 per cent in the previous year.\n\nAt the same time, intense competition has also led to some consolidation. Membrane supplier Memstar in July agreed to have its business and assets fully acquired by water treatment firm United EnviroTech for $293.4 million, in order to transform into a vertically integrated water solutions provider.\n\nExplaining the move, Memstar said it was \"necessary for an independent membrane provider to offer a complete one-stop water solution to its customers in order to remain competitive\".\n\nBoth companies reported lower or flat-at-best top and bottom lines in their latest quarter.\n\nTo be sure, it wasn't a complete massacre across all water stocks in Q3. Hyflux, for instance, scored a 74 per cent jump in net income to $25.3 million on the back of a 26 per cent rise in revenue to $187.7 million, although DBS analyst Tan Ai Teng notes that Hyflux has not been getting a lot of new contracts, and this is reflected in its share price which has fallen 9.8 per cent year-to-date to $1.19 yesterday.\n\nHanKore Environment Tech and SIIC Environment also boasted better earnings, thanks to newly acquired plants that expanded their capacities, says Ms Tan. This then fed into higher revenue and consequently, higher recurring income stream - likely to continue until they hit full utilisation.\n\nAlthough competition is stiff, it is not a case of not enough slices of pie to go around. Opportunities to pick up contracts are ample, and business demand is still robust in China, says Ms Tan.\n\n\"The issue is that everyone wants good projects, but not all projects give similar returns, depending on location, quality, size, as well as who the offtakers and payers are.\"\n\nThere are some who see the water sector as a proxy to China's urbanisation; as long as it is driving up consumption, water companies will keep seeing the money.\n\nBut there are others who warn that these companies' dependence on water infrastructure spending makes them vulnerable to industry cycles and economic downturns.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development released its latest report on the global economic outlook. Going by its estimates, if China's annual economic growth accelerates to 8.2 per cent in 2014 from an expected 7.7 per cent this year, then perhaps those who belong to the latter train of thought would have less to be anxious about.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Together, the plots are expected to yield about 1,500 units.\n\nOf the three development plots, the mixed-use one, to include private housing, will likely be the first to be rolled out; development is likely to begin by 2015.\n\nThe developer who wins the tender for this site will be required to build a basement carpark big enough to serve Holland Village. The number of lots required is still being worked out.\n\nThe extension, which abuts the existing Holland Village, encompasses the six HDB housing blocks vacated under the Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme in 2011, their adjacent land parcels (including the to-be-closed Buona Vista Swimming Complex) and the carpark now serving Holland Village.\n\nAn access road will be built adjacent to the Holland Village extension area, to channel traffic away from the centre of Holland Village to the car park.\n\nMeanwhile, the HDB will design and develop a new community park. This will be complemented by pedestrian-oriented streets and new public spaces including urban plazas.\n\nA network of pedestrian walkways will be built so that the surrounding public housing developments will continue to enjoy easy access to Holland Village and the Circle Line MRT station.\n\nHolland Village is one of three Singapore neighbourhoods identified as places of character and charm, the atmosphere of which is to be retained. (Serangoon Garden and Jalan Kayu are the other two.)\n\nIn the case of Holland Village, the intimate streetscapes, urban village vibe, and eclectic mix of retail shops and services will be preserved.\n\nThe new buildings to come up in the area will be scaled sensitively to sit with the rest of Holland Village. New buildings will therefore go from low-rise to medium-rise the further they are from the existing Holland Village; the residential towers to be developed on the residential plots will be set back so as not to overwhelm the human scale of the area.\n\nThe extended Holland Village will be bounded by Holland Drive, Holland Road, and Holland Avenue.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The rental value is determined by existing tenancies of similar properties within the same location, SY said, with the valuer usually determining the hypothetical rental on about 70-80 per cent of actual rental values, primarily to avoid excessive objection hearings.\n\nAsked for his view, CH Williams Talhar & Wong managing director Foo Gee Jen concurred. \"He (SY) is right. Annual value in layman's term is the equivalent of annual rental.\"\n\nIn most situations, values and rentals go in tandem, Mr Foo said, but stressed it was not the case at present. Property prices may have doubled or trebled, but rental yields have shrunk.\n\nHe pointed out that a decade ago a property might have yielded 8-10 per cent based on its value, but today is likely to give only 2-3 per cent.\n\nIndeed, in Malaysia's bigger cities, home prices - especially for landed homes - have run so far ahead of yields that buyers mainly purchase for capital appreciation, to hedge against inflation or because they fear that in future houses will be priced even further out of their range.\n\nThanks also to swirling liquidity, low interest rates, easy financing and the free rein of market forces, thousands of housing units have been built in the past six to seven years outpacing rental demand.\n\nBe it in the residential or commercial segment, \"For Sale/Rent\" signs are aplenty in many areas of Kuala Lumpur.\n\nMr Foo said DBKL has the right to review assessments but not the rate, which is 6 per cent for residential properties and double the amount for commercial. He said a lower rate of 2-3 per cent applies for specific areas including Malays reserve land such as Kampung Baru and new settlements and that the Local Government Act allows a maximum rate of 35 per cent on the annual value to be charged as assessment.\n\nAlthough assessments have not been reviewed for 21 years, it has not been for want of trying, according to Kuala Lumpur Mayor Ahmad Phesal Talib.\n\nThe Star reported him as saying that DBKL had tried to do so several times in the past, but had been prevented from doing so.\n\nWhether it was because of economic conditions or politicians feared being unpopular, DBKL appears now prepared to incur the wrath of city folk.\n\nOpposition lawmakers from Pakatan Rakyat (PR) contend that the increases are a \"punishment\" being meted out to Kuala Lumpur residents for voting in PR candidates in the May general election, where the coalition won nine out of 11 parliamentary seats under the Federal Territory. Despite losing the overall popular vote, the Barisan Nasional coalition won more federal seats, giving it control of the Federal Territory (and Kuala Lumpur).\n\nBut the 13th general election was bruising, especially in hot seats such as Lembah Pantai (in the Federal Territory ), ultimately retained by Nurul Izzah Anwar, daughter of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim.\n\nCynics say the proposed huge assessment jumps are to boost DBKL's \"now-running low\" coffers.\n\nHaving released the \"test balloons\", they expect the council to settle on lesser increases to make the assessment revisions more palatable.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With an above-average number of residential and non-residential projects slated for the years ahead, coupled with the government's commitment to doubling Singapore's rail network by 2030, BRC Asia believes the robust local demand for reinforcing steel will continue.\n\nHowever, the group reckoned that \"it should be but a matter of time before the demand and supply situation reverses\", given the aggressive expansion of major players and new entrants to the local reinforcing steel industry in recent years.\n\nBRC Asia said its joint venture in China made a loss in 2013, due to provisions for doubtful debts of about $1.4 million. It expects the operating environment there to \"continue to be challenging in the coming year\".\n\nBRC Asia has proposed a final dividend of 1.2 cents per share, making it a total of 1.7 cents per share for the whole year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He added that the earlier situation, in which emerging economies boosted the global economy, has reversed and that they are now exerting an overall drag.\n\nLong-standing risks such as fragilities in the euro-area banking sector and the Japanese fiscal situation have been augmented by new concerns, notably the possibility of \"significant financial instability\" in emerging economies, especially during the exit from unconventional monetary policies in the US, the OECD said.\n\nGrowth in the 35 \"advanced\" members of the Paris-based body is projected to slow this year to 1.3 per cent from 1.6 per cent last year; in the six non-OECD economies covered by Global Economic Outlook (Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa), growth is set to drop from 5.1 per cent to to 4.8 per cent.\n\nChina is an exception. Its growth this year is forecast to stay at last year's level of 7.7 per cent and to accelerate to 8.2 per cent next year. US growth will drop sharply from last year's 2.8 per cent to 1.7 per cent this year, while growth in Japan will slow slightly to 1.8 per cent this year. The euro area will remain in recession until next year.\n\nMr Padoan recently listed three events that have unsettled confidence and market stability. Apart from concerns about developments in some emerging economies, he cited the threat of US monetary tapering and its impact on capital flows, plus the fact that the US came close to a \"potentially catastrophic\" crisis over its government debt ceiling.\n\nThe OECD warned in its report: \"These episodes could easily be replayed - quite possibly in a more virulent form - in the period ahead.\"\n\nThe report noted that global recovery remains modest and uneven, with continued divergence in activity developments between and within advanced and emerging economies.\n\nIt said: \"Almost all of this reflects a further growth slowdown in large emerging market economies, which is tempering the pace of the recovery in the OECD economies.\n\n\"Global activity and trade are projected to strengthen gradually in 2014 and 2015, but the recovery is likely to remain modest.\n\n\"Growth in the large emerging market economies is expected to remain subdued by past standards, held back by supply-side constraints, recent policy actions and the recent tightening of financial conditions triggered by expectations about US monetary policy.\"\n\nThe slowdown in emerging economies is likely to exert some modest drag on activity in advanced economies, although the United States will be \"relatively sheltered from such feedback\", said Global Economic Outlook.\n\nThe OECD emphasised that monetary policy \"needs to remain very accommodative, especially in the euro area, where deflation risks have risen and Japan, where asset purchases should be continued as planned\".\n\nIn the United States, should unemployment continue to fall and inflation strengthen as projected, asset purchases should be wound down in 2014 and policy interest rates start to be raised in 2015.\n\nTurmoil following the tapering discussions by the Federal Reserve in mid-year \"has revealed how sensitive some emerging market economies are to US monetary policy\", the OECD said. It warned that this may involve turbulence when actual tapering takes place as needed, with negative feedback effects on advanced economies.\n\nThe planned slowing in the pace of fiscal consolidation in the United States and the euro area \"is appropriate, given the state of public finances and the economic outlook (while) strong fiscal tightening in Japan is necessary to slow public debt accumulation and eventually reduce debt\".\n\nThe OECD added that structural reforms are critical for exiting the crisis, notably in Japan, the euro area and many emerging market economies to strengthen growth prospects, debt dynamics and facilitate global and euro area rebalancing.\n\nSpeaking to journalists in Tokyo via a video conference from Paris, OECD principal economist for Japan Randall Jones said that while the OECD had been impressed by initial monetary and fiscal stimulus actions taken by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's administration, bolder structural reforms are needed in Japan to support lasting economic recovery.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Adjusted for inflation, the market remains below the peak it reached earlier in the decade. And by the end of the day, the market averages had retreated somewhat, with the Dow closing up slightly and the S&P reversing course and ending down.\n\nBut those easily remembered strings of zeros represented new benchmarks for a stock market that has already soared more than 160 per cent since it hit bottom in March 2009. And they might entice investors who have been late to the party to enter it now, even if prices are no longer as cheap as they were a few years ago.\n\n\"A number like Dow 16,000 doesn't mean anything in isolation,\" said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Boston. \"But it helps to create a behavioural bias that gets more individual investors to come back into the market. It's kind of a flag, telling people, 'Don't miss this', and more people who have been sitting on the sidelines will be likely to buy stocks.\"\n\nAs people open their 401(k) and mutual fund statements these days, the numbers have generally been looking much better. That's not just because recent returns have been strong, but also because with the passage of time, the horrendous declines of early 2008 have dropped out of the calculations of five-year stock returns. Perhaps partly because of this, there is some evidence of a modest surge into stock mutual funds recently.\n\nWhile individual investors have often been skittish about the stock market, a consensus of professional strategists became convinced months ago that compared with bonds, stocks were a good bet. That view is still widely held, with some caveats.\n\n\"'Don't fight the Fed' is one of the oldest adages on Wall Street,\" noted David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist of Gluskin Sheff in Toronto. He says that the swelling Federal Reserve balance sheet and the return of the stock market are highly correlated, with Fed officials deliberately pushing investors into buying stocks.\n\nMr Rosenberg, often thought of as a \"permabear\" because of his long-term gloomy outlook, is now cautiously bullish on many stocks and negative about the prospects for the bond market. \"The long rally in bonds is over,\" he said in a recent commentary.\n\nOn Monday, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note fell to 2.67 per cent from 2.7 per cent late Friday, while its price increased 11/32, to 100 24/32.\n\nOne problem, however, is that a range of valuation models show that stocks are relatively attractive - with \"relative\" being the key word - as long as interest rates remain very low. Corporate profits are rising, but not rapidly enough on their own to justify big increases in stock prices.\n\nThe direction of the bond market is therefore critically important to stock investors, who were reassured by testimony last week from Janet Yellen, suggesting that if she is confirmed as the next Fed chairwoman, the central bank will continue to be accommodative as long as the economy remains weak.\n\nA sharp strengthening of the economy, and a tapering of the Fed's US$85 billion in monthly bond purchases - a policy known as quantitative easing - does not seem likely in the next few months, many strategists said.\n\nBut some analysts are bullish without deep conviction. Matt Paschke, for example, co-manages both bullish and bearish portfolios for Leuthold Weeden Capital Management in Minneapolis, including the Grizzly Short fund and the Leuthold Core fund.\n\nOverall, he said, despite stretched valuations in the stock market his firm remains \"cautiously bullish\", largely because the fixed-income market looks so unattractive.\n\n\"There are two schools of thought on stock valuation,\" he said.\n\n\"One says you should only buy stocks when they're cheap. The other says I need to put my money somewhere, so where should I put it? If you look at it that way, stocks are the only game in town, and that thought will probably make us and some other market participants stick around a little longer than we might like because there's nowhere else to go.\"\n\nOn a valuation basis, he said, the stock market isn't particularly appealing. While it's not in extreme bubble territory, he said, the S&P 500 is fairly richly priced right now.\n\nGoing back to 1940, he said, industrial stocks in the index are trading 11.8 times price to cash flow, which puts them in the 83rd percentile, on a historical basis.\n\n\"You'd like to see them in the middle third or lower, but they're in the top third, as far as valuation goes.\"\n\nThey are also very expensive - well into the 90th percentile on a historic basis - according to several other metrics, including price-to-sales and price-to-book ratios, he said. If stock market participants believed that the Fed was about to alter its policy - and bond yields were going to rise sharply in the near future - then there might well be a flight from the stock market, he said. \"We're re-evaluating our position week to week,\" he said.\n\nOn Monday, the Dow closed up 14.32 points, or 0.09 per cent, to 15,976.02, while the S&P 500 fell 6.65 points, or 0.37 per cent, to 1,791.53. The Nasdaq composite index also fell, by 36.9 points, or 0.93 per cent, to 3,949.07.\n\nTim Hayes, chief global investment strategist for Ned Davis Research in Venice, Florida, said that he expected global stock markets to remain in an upward trend for the next few months. But then, he said, \"with valuations getting stretched and monetary conditions becoming less favourable, there are, unfortunately, high probabilities that there will be a serious correction next year\".\n\nLonger term, however, Hayes said, once that battering is over, the bull market is likely to resume.\n\nMr Kleintop said that for the market to keep climbing, it's important that \"the economy start growing a little faster\", adding, \"I think it can do that.\"\n\nStill, he said, it's quite possible that investors who jump into the market now might experience an immediate 10 to 15 per cent decline, one that is probably overdue in a bull market of this duration.\n\n\"It would be unfortunate,\" he said, \"if people who have stayed out of the market see the momentum, come in and get hurt.

UE had indicated earlier its intention not to preserve the listing status of WBL.\n\nIn a joint statement issued yesterday, both UE Centennial Venture and WBL said that the WBL board had already considered the delisting proposal.\n\nThe board also plans to make an application to the SGX for a waiver from the need to hold an extraordinary general meeting to get approval from shareholders for the delisting.\n\n\"The offeror (UE Centennial Venture) is of the view that the delisting will provide the UE Group and WBL with greater control and management flexibility in utilising and deploying the available resources of the WBL Group,\" said the joint announcement.\n\nUnder the delisting proposal, all remaining shareholders will be offered an exit at $4.45 in cash for each stock unit.\n\nThis price is calculated using the previous stock unit offer of $4.50 and adjusting for a five-cent interim dividend per stock unit that was paid by the company in August to shareholders.\n\nEach shareholder who accepts the exit offer will receive $4,450 for every 1,000 offer stock units tendered.\n\nThe exit offer presents shareholders who find it difficult to exit their investments in WBL as a result of the stock's trading suspension with a chance to liquidate and realise their investment before the company is delisted from the SGX. The stock has been suspended from trading since May 30.\n\nShares of UE ended trading yesterday at $1.79, up half a cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The firm, controlled by Eike Fuhrken Batista, once touted as one of the richest men in the world, could run out of cash by year-end, according to news reports.\n\nPetronas' move could spell the end of what might have been a promising find for OGX, a development that could have meant a lifeline for the struggling Brazilian group. But OGX may not just cave in without a fight. According to Reuters, the firm said it was evaluating its options and might consider taking legal action against the Malaysian firm.\n\nIf so, the dispute would go to an arbitration tribunal in Brazil in line with the original conditional agreement between the two companies. Indeed, when OGX filed for bankruptcy protection on Oct 30, it had said it expected the dispute to end up in arbitration over the deal struck with Petronas.\n\nPetronas does not seem concerned. Indeed, it had set as a pre-condition to the deal that OGX restructure its debt.\n\n\"The deal is still pending full clarity with regard to the restructuring exercise,\" Petronas president Shamsul Azhar Abbas told reporters in Kuala Lumpur last week. \"OGX hasn't met the condition precedent. The debt restructuring has to happen first.\"\n\nOn another level, Petronas could also be trying to scale down its overseas investment after its C$5.2 billion (S$6.2 billion) buyout in 2011 of Canada's Progress Energy Resources, which has enormous shale gas assets. The firm hopes to rope in other partners to reduce its costs and secure a market in Asia for the liquefied natural gas (LNG) it would eventually produce and export from Canada.\n\nThose costs, which include building an LNG facility and a 900 km pipeline, could be prohibitive. So in March, Petronas sold a 10 per cent interest in the project to Japan Petroleum Exploration Co.\n\nMr Shamsul also disclosed to reporters last week that the firm was close to selling another 10 per cent in the project to an undisclosed partner, identified by the Indian press as Indian Oil Corp, the country's biggest refiner.\n\nEven so, the unwinding of the OGX deal could bring closure to what might have been a promising find. The Tubarao Martelo fields could hold as much as 108.5 million barrels of oil, including proven, probable and possible reserves, DeGolyer and MacNaughton, an oil-reserves auditing company, said in a report posted on OGX's website.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Another group which delivered a proposal is said to be infrastructure firm Invepar and Germany's Fraport, which operates Frankfurt Airport. The winning bid will be announced on Friday.\n\nCAI, a wholly owned subsidiary of Changi Airport Group (CAG), confirmed that it has submitted a bid each for the two airports.\n\nThe minimum bid for Galeao, the country's second busiest airport, has been set at 4.83 billion reais (S$2.62 billion) while that for Confins is 1.1 billion reais. However, the appointed operator will also be expected to pump in investments to the tune of 5.7 billion reais for Galeao and 3.5 billion reais for Confins over the course of the concession period in order to upgrade infrastructure and facilities.\n\nFor Galeao, this includes 26 loading bridges and a new parking facility, in addition to expansion of the airport apron, while Confins will require a second runway. The airports are run by state-linked airport management firm Infraero.\n\nBrazil has been privatising some of its airports in a bid to revamp its existing and ageing infrastructure, which have failed to keep up with the pace of growth.\n\n\"For the great challenge of renovating and modernising infrastructure in the country, there is the new possibility that with international operators - operators with great experience - we can encourage a cultural change in our airports,\" Brazilian Civil Aviation Secretary Moreira Franco was quoted by Bloomberg as saying.\n\nBrazil's domestic and international passenger growth slowed in 2012 as weaker GDP growth had a knock-on effect on travel demand, forcing the nation's carriers to scale back capacity and shelve expansion. This comes on the heels of sharp double-digit growth in 2010 and 2011. However, despite the ongoing challenges in the short term, the \"outlook over the medium to long-term remains bright\", noted CAPA, or the Centre for Aviation, in a report earlier this year.\n\nGaleao, which handled about 17.5 million passengers in 2012, is expected to see this rise to 60 million per year by 2038 when the 25-year contract ends, while Confins' 10.4 million passengers is set to increase to 43 million passengers per year by 2043.\n\nLast year, Brazilian national civil aviation agency Anac sold the rights to three other airports - including Sao Paulo International which drew a bid from CAI and its partner Odebrecht.\n\nCAI, which provides management and consultancy services, has a track record that spans over 40 airports in more than 20 countries.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

CapitaLand currently holds about 59.1 per cent, or 341.9 million stapled securities.\n\nCitigroup Global Markets Australia is underwriting the sale, which is being done through an overnight accelerated book build.\n\nCiti is the sole bookrunner and underwriter. When contacted, Citi said it was unable to comment on the pricing. Transaction terms seen by newswires, have, however, put the pricing at A$3.685 to A$3.75 per stapled security.\n\n\"There could be sufficient buyers in the market and giving these buyers little time to think about the price will allow CapitaLand to get the best price,\" said Roger Tan, chief executive of Voyage Research.\n\nThe quick book build \"may also reduce the speculation on the counter as CapitaLand tries to sell their stake\", Mr Tan said. But the sale might also signal that there is little upside left to Australand's share price, he added.\n\nAustraland shares last traded at A$3.75, down 13 Australian cents, or 3.4 per cent, before a trading halt yesterday. They had been on the climb from adjusted lows of below A$1 in 2009, hitting a high of A$3.96 earlier this month. Home prices in some parts of Australia have risen rapidly in recent months, sparking talk of a bubble.\n\nAustraland was a subsidiary of DBS Land before the latter's merger with Pidemco Land in 2000 to form CapitaLand. Australand had launched an initial public offering in Australia and Singapore in 1997. Its Singapore secondary listing was delisted in 2011 because the costs of maintaining the listing outweighed the benefits.\n\nLate last year, Australand rejected a proposal by larger rival GPT Group to buy its commercial and industrial business and investment property portfolio.\n\nCapitaLand said at the beginning of the year that it was reassessing its investment in Australand as well as its commercial and residential investments in the UK, India and Gulf Cooperation Council nations, as it sought to sharpen its focus on its key markets in Singapore and China.\n\nIn May this year, GPT abandoned its bid to buy Australand, citing differences over pricing.\n\nIn July, CapitaLand concluded its business review of Australand and said that it remained a key investment. Offers for the whole and parts of Australand were not sufficiently compelling, CapitaLand said.\n\nCapitaLand last traded at $3.06, down four cents, or 1.3 per cent, before a trading halt took effect yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That means real GDP (gross domestic product) growth for the whole of 2013 is likely to fall within the government's projection of between 4.5 and 5 per cent.\n\nIf anything, economists have become even more bullish. RAM Holdings economist Yeah Kim Leng thinks that the country will grow at between 5 and 5.5 per cent. It is a view that is shared by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch and the government of Malaysia. Barclays Bank, on the other hand, estimates next year's growth at 5.7 per cent. And all talk that the country might face a \"twin deficit\" as it did in 1997 has vanished.\n\nA country experiencing a budget deficit as well as a current-account deficit on its balance of payments can be vulnerable to speculative attacks, as Malaysia discovered during the 1998 Asian financial crisis. The talk surfaced after the country's current-account surplus in the second quarter declined sharply to less than RM3 billion (S$1.17 billion).\n\nThe current account's sharp recovery in the third quarter - to almost RM10 billion - indicates that the second-quarter performance was just a glitch. Even so, lower commodity prices have seen a systematic decline in the current-account surplus over the last four years. So any return to the years of huge surpluses is unlikely. Still, Malaysia can expect yearly surpluses of RM35 billion to RM40 billion over the next two years - which is fairly robust. And commodity prices have begun turning upwards.\n\nPrime Minister Najib Razak has indicated that a 6 per cent goods and services tax will be imposed beginning April 2015. That's good, but some of his other promises in his recent budget speech have been vague. For instance, in his promise to bring the budget deficit down to 3.5 per cent of GDP, he said he would cut subsidies by 20 per cent. That's over RM7 billion, which can only come from increases in the price of fuel. While cutting down the fuel subsidy is politically doable now that the elections are over, it remains to be seen if the government's resolve will be sustained.\n\nThen there is all this waste and leakages in government procurement. It could run into over RM40 billion. That's almost 5 per cent of GDP which, if addressed, would change a 15-year budget deficit into a surplus. Clearly, there is virtue in a surplus. Consider that the Selangor administration was one of the few lauded by the Auditor-General's latest report. The state has racked up a budget surplus of almost RM3 billion.\n\nThere is only one conclusion to be drawn. Despite the warnings from international rating agencies such as Fitch, the Malaysian economy remains resilient amid an uncertain global recovery. Rightly then, Moody's Investors Service has set Malaysia's government bond rating at A3 and upgraded the outlook to positive from stable.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Alternatively, StarHub's prepaid users may subscribe to WeChat on a daily basis for 40 cents a day.\n\nWhile the pricing set up between the two telcos is similar, there is a critical difference - SingTel's arrangement with WhatsApp was launched as an exclusive one, but StarHub's partnership with WeChat was not.\n\nIn response to queries from The Business Times yesterday, SingTel said it is \"open to working with WeChat and other providers to offer services to its prepaid customers\". It added that it has seen \"strong demand\" for its WhatsApp plans since their launch.\n\nStarHub has about 1.13 million prepaid users to SingTel's 1.77 million as at the quarter ended Sept 30, 2013. M1, with about one million prepaid customers, still intends to roll out Rich Communications Services (RCS), the mobile industry's alternative to third-party mobile apps such as WhatsApp. StarHub, which also announced plans for RCS earlier this year, will launch it in the first half of 2014.\n\nAsked how StarHub's plans for Joyn fit alongside its tie-up with WeChat, the telco's spokesman replied: \"We believe it is important to offer our customers choice.\"\n\nIn Singapore, there are no official active user numbers for WhatsApp and WeChat, but according to iOSappStats, WhatsApp is ranked seventh on the iTunes store in the free app stakes, while WeChat is in 12th place.\n\nGlobally, the WhatsApp-WeChat rivalry rages on. WhatsApp remains in the lead with more than 350 million monthly active users (MAU), but WeChat is on its tail with 271.9 million MAU for the quarter ended Sept 30, 2013.\n\nFor the first nine months of 2013, StarHub's average monthly SMSes sent by its prepaid users plummeted by almost a third year on year as consumers increasingly used messaging apps such as WhatsApp, WeChat and KakaoTalk for free.\n\nAt the same time, StarHub's mobile consumption of data has taken off in the opposite direction, as it has across the industry. It is in this direction, too, that the money has moved.\n\nOn rival SingTel's end, non-SMS data accounted for 27 per cent of the average revenue per user for the quarter ended Sept 30, up from 20 per cent in the same quarter last year.\n\nOver the coming quarters, both telcos will look to their messaging app partnerships to shore up average revenues, at least on the prepaid front.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This regional centre, to house northern Singapore's first business park cluster, could put 100,000 jobs on the market when it is fully developed in the next decade or so.\n\nIndustrial parks such as Seletar Aerospace Park, Defu Industrial Estate and Lorong Halus Industrial Park will continue to be developed;\n\nexisting industrial estates such as Tanjong Kling and Tukang Innovation Park, Tuas Biomedical Hub and Sungei Kadut will be rejuvenated by JTC Corporation\n\nto raise land productivity and keep businesses there competitive.\n\nBut even as decentralisation plans are made, the city centre will continue to grow. New offices, retail space and homes, as well as redevelopment and sales sites near Tanjong Pagar MRT station are in the pipeline.\n\nThe URA envisages a new shopping and entertainment belt along Bayfront Avenue, which will stretch from Marina Bay Sands to Marina Bay Station Square, which will create more jobs.\n\nAs for housing, the land set aside in Holland Village, Kampong Bugis and Marina South makes up part of the land set aside in this Draft Master Plan for half a million homes. Most of the land will be for public housing.\n\nHolland Village will be extended by six hectares, anchored by a mixed development project that will have a parking station. Two other residential sites have been earmarked in that precinct, along with pedestrian-friendly streets and a community park.\n\nThe 18-ha Kampong Bugis site is slated to become a high-density residential precinct offering around 4,000 private homes.\n\nThe 21.5-ha Marina South area, just off Gardens by the Bay, is set to be turned into a mixed-use residential district offering around 9,000 private homes. Being explored is the idea of having an 800-metre-long underground mall and an elevated walkway from Bay South Gardens to the seafront. Development is expected after 2017 or 2018.\n\nKampong Bugis and Marina South will be testbeds for fenceless residential communities and more pedestrian and cyclist-friendly designs.\n\nWith creating green spaces a key thrust in this Draft Master Plan, one goal is to have 90 per cent of residents living within 400 metres of a park. Plans are in the works to create more than 60 km of nature trails, 360 km of park connectors and a 150 km Round-Island Route; 900 ha of reservoirs and 100 km of waterways are to be opened up for recreation.\n\nOn the heels of the recently announced plans to boost public transport under the Land Transport Master Plan 2013, the URA will promote cycling-friendly environments with other agencies. All HDB towns will have their own cycling networks, and cycle paths will grow from 230 km to more than 700 km.\n\nIn the area of enhancing the Singapore identity, the URA will preserve various landmarks; it plans to gazette more than 70 buildings for conservation, adding to the list of more than 7,100 buildings. The latest additions include the Queenstown Library, Alexandra Hospital and the former Commonwealth Avenue Wet Market.\n\nNeighbourhoods such as Holland Village, Serangoon Gardens and Jalan Kayu will join 15 other locations with distinct character, so that their vibe and unique qualities will be preserved and even enhanced.\n\nAs for plans for Singapore further into the future, the URA envisages a Greater Southern Waterfront, where about 1,000 ha of land - freed up by moving out the City Terminals and Pasir Panjang Terminal from 2027 - will be developed. Plans for this area have not been finalised, but six concepts have been mooted. Among them are a plan to extend the city to this Southern Waterfront, creating a continuous seaside promenade linking places of interest and creating waterfront districts, each with its own character.\n\nThe public are invited to give their feedback on the Draft Master Plan 2013, as well as for the new cycling routes and plans for the Greater Southern Waterfront. Views can be submitted at the Draft Master Plan 2013 website. The URA is holding a month-long exhibition at the URA Centre from today.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In terms of the timing, that's where we need to be practical and realistic and we need to accord sufficient time for the phasing out to happen,\" said JTC assistant chief executive officer of Cluster Development Group 2, Eunice Koh.\n\nShe added that there will be clarity only in the year 2015 on what the Master Plan would entail for the three industrial estates, as the review of the plan is still ongoing.\n\nOn whether it is certain that all firms currently located in the three areas will have to relocate, Ms Koh said: \"We don't know the extent until 2015.\"\n\nThe industrial estates at Sungei Kadut, Yew Tee and Kranji together house the operations of many firms from the furniture, timber, construction and engineering industries. JTC said that it currently does not have details on the number of firms with operations in these industrial estates.\n\nMs Koh's comments were made yesterday after JTC held a closed-door meeting with some industrialists who have their firms in the affected areas, at the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI). The chamber helped to facilitate discussions between JTC, the industrialists and their respective trade associations.\n\nJTC is now working to help 116 firms whose leases expire between next year and 2019. The affected industrialists are worried about their future because of the uncertainty over the renewal of their leases. The Master Plan, which decides how land will be used in the future, is still in the works, although a draft is being made public today.\n\nAt yesterday's meeting, JTC said the affected firms can apply to extend their leases until 2020.\n\nTo do so, companies will have to fill in a one-page form. A JTC officer will then engage the individual firms and assess their application.\n\nCriteria that they will be assessed on include their value added and productivity projections over a three-year period, which starts from the time the lease extension is granted.\n\nSaid JTC's Ms Koh: \"There must be a productivity increment, so they have to declare it and at the end of three years we have to look at it again.\"\n\n\"We are looking at whatever the members are achieving (currently), plus a certain growth. That is a reasonably achievable level . . . It is the spirit of improvement that we are trying to encourage.\"\n\nMs Koh added that JTC hopes to process all applications by June next year.\n\nSCCCI president Thomas Chua said that industries such as the furniture and timber sectors are very happy with JTC's gesture.\n\nAt the very least, it gives industrialists a timeline so that they can continue to make plans for the business, said Mr Chua in Mandarin. \"We have come to a happy conclusion.\"\n\nFreddie Ng, president of the Singapore Timber Association, said: \"Most of our members' leases expire in 2015 and 2016, so actually this is quite urgent . . . In view of (how) the Master Plan is still on review, JTC has come up with this solution to extend (our lease) to 2020, of course with certain criteria . . . so my members are definitely aware that they have to pay attention to productivity and value add.\"\n\nHe added that JTC's offer is \"very welcome\" news because from now to 2020, my members have seven years to plan to bring in what is necessary to do value adding\".\n\nOf the 116 firms whose leases are up in the next six years, 76 are from the timber trade.\n\nTony Pang, assistant honorary secretary at the Singapore Furniture Industries Council, said that the five affected furniture firms - which include his company V-Mark Woodcraft - will now be able to continue with their business plans knowing that they have seven years, up till 2020, to work with.\n\nThe offer to extend their leases means that the firms can \"still continue with their business knowing that there is seven years to play with\", said Mr Pang.\n\n\"They can manage cost, they can rethink their business strategy for management in line with the new labour situation we are facing in Singapore right now, and then plan ahead for the future growth of the company. So this news we are getting today is very beneficial and we are very thankful for it.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They also experienced the strongest surge in wealth - 13 per cent to US$1.18 trillion. Globally, there are some 2,170 billionaires, according to the Wealth-X and UBS Billionaire Census 2013.\n\nLast month, Credit Suisse said that it would speed up the strategy of rebalancing resources to its two businesses of private banking and wealth management (PB&WM) and investment banking (IB) by shifting more capital to the PB&WM unit.\n\nRisk-weighted assets allocation to PB&WM came to 29 per cent in 2011 and this had grown to 40 per cent, but the infusion of an additional 15-20 billion francs of risk weighted assets will take that to 50 per cent, said Mr Meister. \"It's quite an important shift in allocation.\"\n\nThe additional capital will boost the bank's ability to sell more loans to the clients, mainly in emerging markets.\n\n\"If you want to be successful in the ultra high net worth segment, lending is a pre-condition,\" he said.\n\nEntrepreneurs - and there are many among the Asian wealthy - require credit, said Francesco de Ferrari, Credit Suisse head of private banking Asia Pacific.\n\nCredit Suisse is not just about preserving and growing wealth, it's also about helping clients via the investment bank to monetise their businesses with corporate finance solutions such as public offerings, he said.\n\nThe aim to increase collaboration revenues is working pretty successfully in Asia. Collaboration revenues generated through the provision of cross-divisional solutions to the super- wealthy in Asia grew by 125 per cent in 2012, and a further 58 per cent year on year in the first nine months of 2013.\n\nGlobally, collaboration revenues, which made up 17 per cent of net revenues in the first nine months of 2013, rose 5 per cent.\n\nFor the first nine months of 2013, Credit Suisse ranked second in share of wallet across all products in investment banking in South-east Asia, according to Dealogic. It ranked third in equity capital markets in Asia-Pacific ex-Japan.\n\nIn Asia, Credit Suisse employs over 7,000 people, with about 4,000 in Singapore.\n\nIts Asian private banking business employs about 1,000 people with the bulk in Singapore, which is also its largest private banking operations outside Switzerland.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The segment recorded an increase in revenue of 108 per cent from US$6.4 million last year to US$13.2 million. The jump was due to improvement in utilisation rates and higher demand for their vessels.\n\nWhile gross profit increased 33 per cent to US$20 million in the third quarter and gross profit margin also went up by one percentage point to 41 per cent, the bottom line was hurt by \"other operating income\" falling 84 per cent, from US$11.7 million last year to US$1.9 million due mainly to the different timing for vessel sales.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses also increased by 72 per cent to US$7.9 million as the group ramps up its operational capabilities to support expected growth plans.\n\nFinance costs went up 41 per cent, from US$2.4 million to US$3.4 million in the third quarter. This was mainly attributable to more vessel loans obtained which increased bank borrowings as the group expanded its fleet.\n\nFor the first nine months, net profit rose 36 per cent to US$40.4 million while revenue climbed 25 per cent to US$126.2 million.\n\nThe company recently completed its initial public offering (IPO) which raised net proceeds of S$150.6 million.\n\nPang Yoke Min, executive chairman of Pacific Radiance, said that the company was well-positioned to capture growth opportunities ahead.\n\n\"These IPO funds will be channelled into growing our presence in targeted high-growth markets of Malaysia, Indonesia, Africa, Australia and Latin America, where exploration and production (E&P) budgets are expected to expand rapidly,\" he said.\n\nThe group is planning to launch its shiprepair yard in 2015, which will provide it with greater control over its fleet enhancement programme.\n\nPacific Radiance owns and operates more than 130 offshore support vessels and has moved to establish a range of complementary businesses. These include marine equipment business and project logistics services.\n\nPacific Radiance shares closed down two cents at 89.5 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The deal is expected to close by the end of 2013, subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nThe acquisition will give ICE, which also owns NYSE Euronext, a quick boost to its Singapore presence without having to run the full regulatory gauntlet.\n\n\"The acquisition of SMX represents an important step in ICE's growth trajectory as we look to expand our customer base and markets in Asia by establishing a local exchange and clearing presence,\" ICE chief strategy officer David Goone said in a statement. \"In recent years, Asia-based trading activity in our benchmark energy and interest rate products has been rising as the region increases in importance in global markets.\"\n\nSMX offers 17 types of contracts, including black pepper futures and gold futures linked to Indian gold prices.\n\nSince opening trading in August 2010, SMX has seen turnover climb steadily, with US$71 billion of traded contracts in 2012. But both SMX and SMX Clearing have struggled to turn a profit, posting losses in the year ended March 2013, according to FTIL's latest annual report.\n\nSMX is considered a very small player in Singapore, and several analysts told The Business Times that they did not know enough about it to comment.\n\nBut the lack of attention paid to SMX suggests that it was not seen as a major competitor for SGX, which posted $30.9 million profit from its derivatives business in the quarter ended September 2013.\n\nEven though ICE's entrance could present a more powerful rival for SGX, the competition for SGX on the derivatives front is already global in nature.\n\nSMX's persistent losses suggest that it is not so easy to create a vibrant and profitable commodities derivatives market in Singapore, CIMB analyst Kenneth Ng said.\n\nBoth SMX and SGX \"have been trying to grow their commodity business\", Mr Ng said.\n\n\"By and large, SGX's derivatives business is still largely driven by the index futures,\" he said. \"They've been talking about growing commodity contracts for a while, oil palm, energy and the like, but those things have not really taken off so much.\"\n\nThe challenge is that commodities contracts are traded on a global basis, and incumbents tend to enjoy strong momentum that makes it difficult for newcomers to draw business, Mr Ng said.\n\nFollowing the acquisition, ICE expects to move SMX and SMX Clearing to ICE's trading and clearing platforms.\n\nWith SMX, ICE will also be able to offer regional hedging opportunities to market participants.\n\nICE said it would continue to base SMX in Singapore with an independent board of directors, but told The Business Times that decisions on management changes have not been made yet.\n\nThe SMX acquisition comes as FTIL is facing pressure in India after regulators there shut down its National Spot Exchange on charges of allowing illegal trades. FTIL said it would use the proceeds of the sale to pay down debt.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This frees up the ground-level space above the mall for a pedestrian walkway.\n\nSeparately, an elevated landscaped walkway will take pedestrians from the Bay South Gardens to the seafront; cycling paths will thread through other parts of Marina Bay.\n\nIn a district to shape up as one of Singapore's most environmentally friendly, fewer cars could well be seen on its roads - courtesy of a network of underground carparks that the URA is looking into.

Located at the convergence of two major waterways - Rochor Canal and Kallang River - the area has also been identified as a pilot area for a high-density, water-sustainable precinct. This means developments there will incorporate effective stormwater management and urban design features such as vegetated swales, bio-retention basins and detention ponds to manage rainwater runoff.\n\nDevelopment of the 18 hectares of land in Kampong Bugis may begin after 2016. Of this area, about 80 per cent will be given over to about 4,000 units of private housing.\n\nTo support the envisaged reduced dependency on cars, developers will be encouraged to set up car-sharing and bicycle-sharing schemes, which will operate alongside the network of bus services and two MRT stations in the area.\n\nThe upshot of promoting these greener, alternative modes of travel is that future residential projects in the area will need to provide fewer car park lots.\n\nPreliminary feedback from developers has been positive, with many of them noting that demand for car park space is already generally lower in places nearer the city centre.\n\nAlthough the proposed concept of greener commutes and being \"car-reduced\" is not expected to rock the boat significantly, public feedback is being sought in this area.\n\nAnother facet of the URA's vision for Kampong Bugis is fenceless housing, to encourage community interaction. Such a \"fenceless precinct\", as distinct from the conventional \"gated condominium\" approach, entails through-block links, courtyards and open spaces; developers will also be encouraged to include community amenities such as childcare centres, kindergartens, cafes, clinics and playgrounds in their plans.\n\nThese amenities will be set amid greenery.\n\nKampong Bugis, with its urban features supporting \"water-sustainable\" practices, is expected to enhance sustainable water management practices here and to become a new high-density model for sustainable water practices internationally.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He also said there is space on the greenfield site to accommodate further expansion.\n\n\"In our overall business expansion plan, the South-east Asian market is extremely important to us due to its geographic location, strong projected growth and our customer base,\" highlighted Mr O'Shea at the ground-breaking ceremony yesterday.\n\n\"We recognise the immense importance of this market and are taking these steps to expand our presence here with close proximity to our customers.\"\n\nAccording to Mr O'Shea, there are about 100 PW150A engines in service in the region, with the number set to double over the next decade.\n\nThe group expects that the new facility - its first in Asia - will mean faster turnaround times and lower shipping costs for owners and operators of the PW150A engine.\n\nWhile Vector Aerospace does have a sales office in Malaysia, this will be moved to Singapore once the new centre is opened.\n\nPhilip Ang, whose past roles include vice-president (heavy maintenance) for SIA Engineering Company, has been appointed general manager of Vector Aerospace Asia.\n\nVector Aerospace Asia expects to ramp up the current staff strength of four to 140 over the next three years. Staff will be sent for training at another of its facilities in Canada, which is already overhauling PW150A engines.\n\nAcquired by Eurocopter Holdings - a subsidiary of European aerospace giant EADS - in 2011, Vector Aerospace earned revenues of about US$750 million in 2012. It has 21 MRO facilities across six continents.\n\nLim Kok Kiang, assistant managing director at the Economic Development Board (EDB), said: \"Vector Aerospace's introduction of PW150 engine MRO capabilities here further enhances Singapore's position as a leading engine MRO hub.

Even so, it was not enough to offset its escalating costs which surged 16.6 per cent from a year ago.\n\nThe full-service carrier had previously said it would stick to a load active-yield passive strategy - even at the expense of yield compression - believing it would deliver the desired results as long as costs could be contained.\n\nThat was not the case in the period under review. Fuel costs rose 11 per cent owing to a 17 per cent increase in fuel volume. A weaker ringgit against the greenback also offset the fall in jet fuel prices. Other expenses also jumped: aircraft-related by RM90 million, marketing costs by RM174 million and non-aircraft related, RM46 million.\n\nYields thinned to 21.9 sen, or 16 per cent lower year on year, as competition also forced MAS to slash fares. With privately owned Malindo Air introducing low promotional fares to win market share, yields could come under further attack.\n\nRHB Research aviation analyst Jerry Lee said MAS management had guided the airline would continue to focus on cost-restructuring to keep expenses under control as well as rationalise its routes by leveraging the profitable ones.

The joint appearance at the signing ceremony accentuated the airlines' status as the dominant force in global aviation, with unmatched buying power.\n\nSome 86 per cent of the new 777 backlog is with Gulf airlines, while Emirates accounts for almost half of bookings for Airbus SAS's A380 super-jumbo, tipping the balance of global aviation towards the Mid-East at the expense of other carriers. Minutes after Boeing exited the stage, Emirates announced another record deal with Airbus, for 50 A380 super-jumbos.\n\nMr Al Baker, whose airline is the second-largest among the three major carriers, wouldn't say which of the two made the overture towards cooperation, while adding that the approach is good for employment and for the aviation industry and \"shows the world that we're competitors, but we also work together\". Emirates representatives weren't available to comment on the cooperation with Qatar.\n\nThe joint approach let Qatar Airways and Emirates exchange information on technical aspects and performance of the aircraft, and take their findings back to Chicago-based Boeing, Mr Al Baker said. The two carriers are known to be particularly demanding customers, with Emirates running its wide-body aircraft in high-frequency operations, while Qatar has put particular focus on the luxurious outfit of its cabins.\n\n\"It has been a very successful negotiation for both of us,\" Mr Al Baker said. \"We always had leverage on aircraft manufacturers, we place such large orders and so often.\"\n\nQatar Airways is building Doha into one of three major hubs for aviation in the Gulf, alongside the Emirates base in Dubai and Etihad Airways PJSC's home airport of Abu Dhabi, stripping away traffic from traditional inter-continental crossroads such as Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam.\n\nThat has intensified competition between the three carriers, making cooperation seem unlikely. Qatar Airways has also become the first Gulf heavyweight to join a global alliance, signing up to the British Airways-led Oneworld partnership, and might have been expected to favour joint purchasing within that group.\n\nStill, aircraft orders are not always spurred by a desire to heighten competition, according to Mr Al Baker.\n\n\"We don't order so often because we want to keep on growing, but because we want to keep our fleet young,\" he said. Emirates said before placing the 777 order that the new planes were required chiefly to replace older variants.\n\nDeutsche Lufthansa AG, which had been talking with Boeing about development of the 777 for two years, sought to offset the clout of the Gulf carriers by getting in with an order first, according to Nico Buchholz, its fleet planning chief.\n\nDoing so locked in performance guarantees for the plane, he said. This ensured that its economics will work well for the Cologne, Germany-based company even if Boeing adapts other parameters to meet extreme operating demands of Gulf carriers flying long distances with full loads out of hot locations.\n\nEtihad, the third-largest Middle Eastern airline, also bought 25 upgraded 777s, though wasn't involved in the collective negotiations with Emirates and Qatar Airways. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The latter's capacity is less than one-third Shell's new project.\n\nMr Cheong earlier told BT that Shell was gearing up to build a new 350,000-tpa facility there, replacing its current 240,000-tpa plant at Woodlands, a site which it will give up when the new Tuas facility is ready by 2015.\n\nThis will boost its lube and grease manufacturing capacity by over 40 per cent.\n\nShell explained that a lube oil blending plant (LOBP) is where base oil is blended with additives to make finished lubricants.\n\nIt comprises three separate areas, namely the base oil and additives storage and blending area; the filling area, and the warehouse. At each LOBP, it uses various base oils to produce a variety of finished products.\n\nA grease manufacturing plant generally consists of a workshop - with a number of production lines, such as grease processing equipment, plant control systems, a lab and filling lines - and a storage warehouse.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The report was commissioned by the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\n\"There are times when the airplane will do something that's unexpected and the pilots will go, 'Why did it just do that?'\" Patrick Veillette, a corporate pilot who wrote his PhD thesis on cockpit automation, said in an interview.\n\nAuto-throttles, computer navigation systems and other automation on planes have improved safety, said Mr Veillette, who didn't participate in the report. Airline safety is at an all-time high, according to accident statistics.\n\nThe downside of these new technologies is that they may be incorrectly programmed more than previous systems and are so complex that pilots don't always understand their actions, Mr Veillette said.\n\nThe report's findings were earlier reported in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe report, entitled Operational Use of Flight Path Management Systems, said it studied 26 accidents from 1996 to 2009 in which automation played a role. The authors also relied on incident reports, cockpit audits and anonymous pilot accounts gathered by airlines and government agencies.\n\nSeveral recent accidents that weren't considered in the report, including the Feb 12, 2009, crash of a regional turboprop approaching Buffalo operated by Pinnacle Airlines Corp's former Colgan unit, are also related to how pilots are trained on cockpit automation, Mr Veillette said. The Colgan accident killed all 49 on the plane and a man on the ground.\n\nA pilot on an Asiana Airlines plane that struck a seawall while attempting to land in San Francisco on July 6 said he thought the plane's auto throttle was maintaining speed, National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Deborah Hersman said after the accident.\n\nPilots accustomed to having autopilots and other devices have allowed basic manual skills to erode, the report said. They also have greater difficulty handling malfunctions of automated systems because they may not understand the systems or haven't been adequately trained.\n\nThe report included 18 recommendations for better training on how cockpit devices work, improved design of the systems and new procedures to minimise the impact of malfunctions or mistakes.\n\nThe FAA, starting when the group that wrote the report began its work in 2006, has taken action on the 18 recommendations. The agency on Feb 5 issued new regulations changing pilot training to emphasise more realistic simulator sessions. That action addresses several of the report's recommendations. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The increase in operating expenditure is also attributed to a one-off cost incurred for redelivery of aircraft.\n\n\"In addition, the group intensified its advertising and promotional activities amid intense competition as part of its long-term strategy to continuously strengthen its presence in key markets,\" the carrier said in its filing with Bursa Malaysia.\n\nMAS said that despite the loss in the current quarter, the group's cash position remained strong at RM5.4 billion.\n\nSeparately, the Minister in the Prime Minister's Department, Shahidan Kassim, has responded to questions on why Prime Minister Najib Razak does not fly MAS on official visits.\n\nHe said MAS does not cover all areas, adding that it is unsuitable for the country's leader to board commercial aircraft together with other passengers.\n\n\"It involves the country's image.

His appointment follows the promotion of current CFO Loh Chin Hua to chief executive officer (CEO) on July 18. Mr Loh, now CEO-designate, will assume Keppel's top position on Jan 1, when current CEO Choo Chiau Beng retires.\n\nAs Keppel's CFO, Mr Chan will be responsible for the group's financial functions, including managing its capital, finance, treasury and tax, as well as its legal matters.\n\nHe has been with SIA for more than 10 years and has been the airline's senior vice-president (SVP) of finance since June 2006.

But the Philippine government's approach and response to the disaster raise questions.\n\nThe latest official death count from the typhoon as at yesterday was close to 4,000, although the actual number remains unclear as many thousands more could also have perished, including at sea. Given the lack of food, water and medicine in the affected areas, the death toll is certain to rise; heartbreakingly, people have died even from easily treatable injuries such as a broken leg. The danger of the spread of disease is also present and there are particularly vulnerable groups such as the elderly, children and pregnant women. The dangers will hopefully recede as aid starts to reach the victims and disaster response teams get to work.\n\nThe response to the disaster has been hampered by the destruction of logistical infrastructure, prolonged power outages, the destruction of local facilities such as hospitals and relief centres and the breakdown of local governance and security structures.\n\nBut for all this, it must be said that the government could have done better, even by its own admission. Most importantly, the measures to prevent the loss of life were seriously inadequate. Early warnings of the typhoon were received, but the authorities underestimated the intensity of the storm. People were moved from coastal areas a few kilometres inland, but the evacuation centres, such as schools, churches and stadiums were themselves devastated. This contrasts sharply with the admirable job done by India's authorities in the lead up to cyclone Phailin in the state of Orissa just last month. Almost a million people were evacuated prior to the arrival of the cyclone - which, like Haiyan, was also a category 5 storm. Food and medicines were moved close to the affected areas in advance, and helicopters, aircraft and warships were put on standby. Although crop and material damage was extensive, thousands of lives were saved, compared to 10,000 lost in a 1999 cyclone in the same area. The Philippines, which faces some 20 typhoons a year, urgently needs to step up its pre-disaster preparedness, which also eases the task of post-disaster relief. As we have seen in disaster after disaster, the job cannot be left to local governments alone. This is probably the single biggest lesson from typhoon Haiyan.\n\nNow will begin the task of reconstruction. This will take years, but it will be done, as it has been done several times before, thanks in large part to the resilience of the people. The Philippines will recover soon from this disaster; its economy, which is in decent shape, is unlikely to suffer lasting damage. But one of the big questions the government must ask itself is what more it could have done, and should do in future.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Economists now expect the government to upgrade its 2013 GDP growth forecast to as high as 4 per cent, when it announces third-quarter figures on Thursday.\n\nNon-oil domestic exports (NODX) expanded for the first time since January, growing 2.8 per cent year-on-year in October - in stark contrast to market expectations of a contraction of 1.1 per cent.\n\nThe pleasant surprise is the latest addition to recent positive economic indicators, including hearty showings in the purchasing managers' index and industrial production numbers.\n\nFindings from the latest Business Times-UniSIM Business Climate Survey, published yesterday, also showed that the economy could expand by up to 3.7 per cent in 2013.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, economists BT spoke to believe growth momentum will strengthen in Q4 and into 2014, and most expect the government to raise its full-year GDP growth forecast beyond its current 2.5-3.5 per cent range.\n\nDBS' Irvin Seah and Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Chua Hak Bin expect the government projection to be revised upwards to 3.5-4 per cent.\n\nYesterday, Dr Chua also raised his 2013 GDP forecast to 3.7 per cent (up from 3.5 per cent) and his 2014 projection to 3.2 per cent (2.8 per cent previously).\n\nSaid JP Morgan economist Sin Beng Ong: \"Following relatively weak prints in Q3 2013, the October trade report builds on the slightly more positive tone seen in the September print and suggests that a modest upturn in external demand appears to be underway.\"\n\nOctober's trade numbers reflected a broad- based improvement across various product categories, as the increase in non-electronic NODX outweighed the decline in electronic NODX.\n\nNon-electronic NODX expanded by 4.9 per cent in October, following a 0.8 per cent increase in September. Apart from printed matter and petrochemicals, IE Singapore said the growth in non-electronic NODX was led by pre-fabricated buildings.\n\n\"This month's high sales of pre-fabricated buildings are likely to be a one-off spike for this half of the year,\" IE Singapore told BT, noting that the segment accounted for around 2 per cent of total NODX in October.\n\nBut electronics exports were no slouch either. Even though the sector continued to remain in contraction mode for a 15th consecutive month, its drag on overall NODX has narrowed to its smallest in a year.\n\nElectronic NODX declined 1.4 per cent year-on-year in October, after a 5.5 per cent contraction in the month before.\n\nSaid Mr Seah: \"I think this October NODX number essentially hints at a strong finish to the year. The improvement in electronics has turned out to be quite a surprise, and ties in nicely with September's electronics industrial production numbers in hindsight.\"\n\nDespite the expected uplift to full-year GDP, however, economists from ANZ, DBS and UOB reckon that NODX is likely to undershoot the official growth forecast of 0-1 per cent this year because of the sector's weakness for much of the year.\n\nSaid Mr Tan: \"With only two more months of NODX releases to go before we end the year, our forecast of a -3 per cent growth in NODX for 2013 is on the optimistic side, as it will imply an average of 14 per cent year-on-year growth in the last two months of this year.\n\n\"Singapore's trade agency's forecast of 0-1 per cent will imply an average growth rate between 33.5-40 per cent. As such, based on recent momentum in trade flows, we think that full-year NODX may likely come in around -4.5 per cent instead.\"\n\nExcept for the US, the EU 27, Japan, South Korea, and Indonesia, shipments to all of Singapore's 10 biggest markets expanded last month.\n\nChina was the top contributor to October's NODX increase, with Taiwan and Malaysia following in second and third places respectively.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Russian television broadcast a blurred video showing a bright flash of light. It also showed a photo of the plane's gaping fuselage with firefighters in the foreground.\n\nThe Tatarstan airlines flight from Moscow had been trying to abort its landing in order to make a second approach when it crashed, killing all 44 passengers and six crew on board, emergency officials said.\n\nFlight U363 took off from Moscow's Domodedovo airport at 6:25pm (1425 GMT) and crashed just over an hour later, emergency officials said. The leased plane was 23 years old.\n\nThere had been no technical problems reported with the plane prior to the flight and regular maintenance and troubleshooting between flights had been conducted, the news agency Interfax cited the airlines' press office as saying. \"The pilots, both born in 1966, had lots of experience,\" the agency cited a spokeswoman as saying.\n\nAccording to local reports, the Boeing lost altitude quickly and its fuel tank exploded on impact.\n\nThere were high winds and above-zero temperatures over the airport in central Russia. Flights to and from the airport were halted until midday yesterday.\n\nKazan, which is 800 km east of Moscow, is the capital of the largely-Muslim, oil-rich region of Tatarstan. A new runway was built at the airport ahead of the World Student Games, held in the city earlier this year.\n\nRussia will host the Winter Olympics in the southern city of Sochi early next year.\n\nThe son of Tatarstan President Rustam Minnikhanov, Irek, was among those killed in the crash, as was the head of the regional Federal Security Service (FSB) Alexander Antonov, according to a passenger list whose authenticity was confirmed by the regional government.\n\nThere was one foreigner, a British national, among the victims.\n\nRussia and the former Soviet republics combined have one of the world's worst air-traffic safety records, with a total accident rate almost three times the world average in 2011, according to the International Air Transport Association.\n\nPrime Minister Dmitry Medvedev called the disaster \"a frightening tragedy\", offering his condolences to the relatives of the victims in a Tweet on Sunday.\n\nState television showed images of a woman scanning a list of passenger names posted outside the airport and crumbling into tears as she apparently recognised one.\n\nBoeing officials had no immediate comment on the circumstances of the crash, but issued a statement. \"Boeing's thoughts are with those affected by the crash of the Tartarstan air company flight.

But the mix could shift towards more ECs, given that demand remains strong while transactions in the private residential market have slowed.\n\nECs, a public-private housing hybrid, are expected to continue to sell well as they are not hit by the TDSR framework.\n\nAlan Cheong, research head at Savills Singapore, said that the authorities would have to read the market carefully to see where demand is, in selecting private housing sites for H1 2014.\n\n\"They may have to release mid-sized sites that can yield 300-500-unit projects, instead of sites for mega projects of say, 700-1,000 units. And the sites should be well-located, preferably near MRT stations, and not be in 'saturated areas'.\n\n\"Ideally, I think they should moderate confirmed-list supply in H1 2014 although the market is still undersupplied until 2015. But they may have other objectives in mind such as town planning.\"\n\nHe thinks that the authorities could trim the quantum of private homes excluding ECs on the confirmed list from about 3,200 for H2 2013 to 2,800 for H1 2014.\n\nThe four sites on the H2 2013 slate yesterday can yield about 2,350 homes in total.\n\nMost property consultants forecast that the private housing site at Upper Paya Lebar Road would fetch top bids of $500-650 psf ppr. Ong Kah Seng, executive director of R'ST Research, sees the winning bid as $470-520 psf ppr, which is more measured compared to Knight Frank's $700-750 psf ppr - the most bullish. Alice Tan, Knight Frank Singapore research head, puts the selling price at about $1,350-1,400 psf.\n\nThis would be significantly higher than the $1,260-1,280 psf average price achieved by the developers of Bartley Residences and Bartley Ridge nearby, said Jones Lang LaSalle.\n\nJLL national director Ong Teck Hui sees the latest site as being less attractive than the two earlier projects since it is bounded by two major roads - Bartley and Upper Paya Lebar, which will result in a project being affected by noise.\n\nTwo EC sites are being offered on the confirmed list - at Canberra Drive and Anchorvale Crescent. Analysts estimate the winning bid for the Canberra site, about 1.2 km from Sembawang MRT Station, to be in the range of $320-380 psf ppr. The previous benchmark in the area was the SkyPark Residences site, which fetched $324 psf ppr last December. The project was launched on Saturday, with 52 per cent of the 506 units sold over the weekend, at an average price of $793 psf.\n\nAnalysts forecast the Anchorvale site's top bid tol be in the $330-400 psf ppr range. Nicholas Mak, executive director at SLP International, sees the site, right next to Cheng Lim LRT Station, and one stop away from Sengkang MRT/LRT Station, as \"arguably the most attractive of the five EC sites on the confirmed list of the H2 2013\" slate.\n\nAlong Choa Chu Kang Drive, next to the Rainforest EC project, an EC site was made available for application yesterday on the reserve list. Mr Mak thinks it is unlikely to be triggered in the next half a year, citing the large EC supply expected in the Choa Chu Kang area. Next month, two adjoining sites in Choa Chu Kang Grove will be launched on the confirmed list.\n\nHowever, R'ST's Mr Ong said the Choa Chu Kang reserve list site has a high chance of being triggered for sale in H1 2014 and that bids might be fairly optimistic. He points to pent-up interest in EC projects going ahead, as projects on any EC sites sold around now are likely to be launched only in 2015 at the earliest, under current rules which allow an EC project to be launched for sale only 15 months from the date of site award or after the physical completion of the foundation works, whichever is earlier.\n\nA maximum 3,110 EC units that are likely to be launched next year (all in the second half) may be insufficient given the average yearly demand of 3,770 EC units bought from developers in the past three years. \"EC demand is set to grow even stronger going into 2014 and beyond, with TDSR encouraging prudent buying and more EC-eligible buyers opting for it over private condos,\" added Mr Ong.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The New York-based company has so far invested US$2 billion in India since its entry in 1989.\n\n\"India is a country with huge potential and it remains an attractive, high-priority market for PepsiCo. We've built a highly successful business in India over the course of many years, and we believe we've only scratched the surface of the long-term growth opportunities that exist for PepsiCo and our partners. This investment is PepsiCo's vote of confidence in India's future and it represents our deep commitment to this great country,\" Indra Nooyi, chairman and CEO, PepsiCo, who is on an India visit, told The Business Times (BT).\n\n\"India is a market for the future,\" added the India-born Ms Nooyi. \"We do not invest based on short term, we are here for the long term. For a long term, India has the demographic dividend, democracy, it has entrepreneurial environment, and a functioning government.\"\n\nPepsiCo and Coca-Cola's investments, driven by an exponentially growing middle class (estimated to be over 200 million people), are likely to be welcomed by the Indian government which is struggling to restore foreign investor confidence in the wake of GDP growth plummeting to a decade low of 5 per cent, a string of corruption scandals involving top officials and high inflation.\n\nAccording to data from researcher Euromonitor International, PepsiCo's share of the carbonated beverage market in India plunged to 36.4 per cent last year, from 40.1 per cent in 2007 while Coca-Cola's has surged to 60.9 per cent from 57 per cent in the same period.\n\nHowever, both companies are betting on robust growth from a low-consumption base of soft drinks in India to rev up sales. Currently, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo together dominate the Indian market for carbonated soft drinks.\n\nIndia, a country of 1.2 billion people, remains one of the most appealing markets for the two beverage titans due to its low per capita consumption of carbonated beverages. Indians on average drink 12 eight-ounce - about 240ml - bottles of Coke a year compared with 92 bottles globally according to industry estimates.\n\nAlso, growth rates in Asia, the Middle East and Africa are almost four to five times those in the US and Europe, making emerging countries such as India a very attractive growth market, said PepsiCo.\n\nPepsiCo and its bottling partners plan to more than double production capacity in India by 2020. Pepsi entered the country at a time when the Indian government was liberalising the economy and opening up a plethora of sectors to foreign investment in the 1990s. Coca-Cola returned in 1993 (after leaving India over a dispute involving handing over its secret recipe) buying out top local cola, Thums Up.\n\nIndia is one of Pepsico's biggest markets globally and the investments will help expand its repertoire of food and drinks in the South Asian nation, the company said. Pepsico has also been adding to its list of offerings while roping in Bollywood actors to endorse its range of products estimated to be worth US$4.25 billion by 2018.\n\n\"A stronger distribution in the existing categories and strong forays into new rural markets have helped the company retain its toehold,\" Mumbai-based trade analyst Murli Menon told BT.\n\nSince entering India, Pepsi claims it has created opportunities for more than 200,000 people through direct or indirect employment and agriculture collaborations. It is estimated that the strategic initiative announced last week will add more than 100,000 additional employment opportunities. Pepsi has 42 plants in India, including franchises. The company also intends to step up collaborative farming that it claims has benefited 24,000 farmers.\n\nOn the other hand, Coca-Cola says that it has already pumped over US$7 billion in India since it re-entered the country in 1993. Coca-Cola India directly employs over 25,000 people and about 150,000 people indirectly.\n\nMarket analysts believe that growth for both companies in the future will be determined by rural sales as the cities are witnessing a level of saturation. Besides, they point out, the dynamics in the urban segment is changing towards healthier options, such as fruit/\n\nvegetable juices and bottled water. It is on the rural turf, therefore, that both companies will joust to enhance their share of the Indian soft drinks pie.\n\nEven so, analysts add that despite a first-mover advantage in the market, PepsiCo has not been able to capitalise on this to elbow past Coca-Cola. \"The latter's well-fleshed out strategy both at the top and bottom-end of the market spectrum, combined with a price-point edge, have so far helped it remain ahead in the race. But in the future, it could be anybody's game,\" sums up Mr Menon.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That acquisition at a court-ordered auction was free of debt and encumbrances and SingHaiyi said that it was at a 77 per cent discount to the unaudited net book value.\n\nFor Vietnam Town, SingHaiyi said that the acquisition price - already settled in full by the company - comprised US$29.8 million to repay an outstanding secured debt and US$3.3 million for the freehold project.\n\nThe project has several parcels of land sitting on a total site area of 853,502 square feet. Of the 256 planned condominium units - each about 1,000 square feet - 115 have been built, of which 64 have been sold.\n\n\"SingHaiyi intends to sell the 51 unsold units in the next one to two years and use the sale proceeds to construct and sell the remaining 141 units within the next three to five years,\" it said.\n\nThe project was launched in 2005 but ran into difficulties in 2009 and was subsequently placed under receivership when its developer lost funding for the project.\n\nSingHaiyi acquired it at a trustee's auction and funded the purchase using proceeds from a recent rights issue and share placement exercise that raised some $226 million to help the company expand its real estate investment to the US.\n\n\"While acquisitions at auctions require cash and quick execution, we will be looking to tap bank financing,\" said SingHaiyi non-executive chairman Neil Bush, who is also a brother of former US president George W Bush.\n\nSingHaiyi, which was recently included as a component of the MSCI Singapore Small Cap Index, has been pursuing a strategy of identifying undervalued US property projects that are facing payment problems and are on the brink of bankruptcy. The company believes that there is upside and money to be made in the moribund US property market as it recovers its value on the back of a broader US economic recovery.\n\nIn its first set of results since its restructuring that saw an injection of fresh funds, the company formerly known as SingExpress showed a half-year profit of $8.4 million and a net cash position of $160.4 million.\n\nYesterday, SingHaiyi's stock closed unchanged at 2.3 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And, to be sure, there are good reasons to expect Ms Yellen to persevere with Mr Bernanke's strategy of buying housing-market bonds in order to lower long-term interest rates, while simultaneously keeping short-term rates close to zero in a twin-pronged approach to stimulate growth.\n\nThis was obvious in her nomination testimony to the Senate banking committee last Thursday, when she said it is imperative that the Fed does what it can to encourage a strong recovery and defended the three rounds of QE that the Fed has implemented since 2008. She pointed out that the Fed is aiding the recovery \"by continuing our asset purchase programme, which we put in place with the goal of assuring a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labour market. We are taking into account the costs and the efficacy as we go along. At this point, I think the benefits exceed the costs.\"\n\nThese statements were taken as confirmation of Ms Yellen's \"dovish\" credentials, which, in turn, are founded on her past staunch support for Mr Bernanke's policies and her reputation for being more concerned with employment than with inflation.\n\nHowever, investors would do well to note that, in the same speech, Ms Yellen also warned that QE cannot continue indefinitely, citing potential risks to financial stability. \"The longer this programme continues, the more we will need to worry about these risks,\" she cautioned. Indeed, previous favourite for the top Fed job Lawrence Summers - who was President Barack Obama's first choice - openly expressed scepticism that QE has any substantial benefits for the real economy.\n\nInvestors should also bear in mind that markets are currently over-reliant on QE, to the extent that investment risk may be systematically understated while valuations could be overstretched.\n\nAs it stands now, though, assuming Ms Yellen is confirmed as the new Fed chief, expectations are that the earliest the Fed is likely to taper QE would be in March, when she would be presiding at her first Federal Open Market Committee meeting.\n\nWith other major central banks in Japan and Europe also operating in accommodative mode, the \"risk on\" phase which has kept equities afloat should continue - at least for a few more months.\n\nHowever, after that, investors should tread cautiously. Once the Fed does start to taper, its dovishness will go into retreat. And it bears knowing that for all her dovish credentials, Ms Yellen has, as a Fed governor, also voted more than 20 times for interest-rate hikes.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Nikkei rose 2.5 per cent following the announcement, with construction stocks being the notable beneficiaries.\n\nThe Olympics boost came just in time. One year after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Abenomics was introduced, Japan's economy is seeing a revitalisation after more than two decades of stagnation.\n\nIn Q2 2013, Japan recorded positive GDP growth for the third consecutive quarter. The Property Business Confidence Index by the Land Institute of Japan also recorded positive numbers for all three segments (developer, brokerage and building management) for the first time since January 2007.\n\nThis is a good sign as it indicates that sentiment has returned to the pre-global financial crisis level. But the question remains whether the property market will generate enough interest from investors and whether the recovery in the sector is sustainable.\n\nBased on the past, the direct implications of hosting major sports events such as the Olympics depend on the size and relative maturity of the property market. The impact also tends to be greater in smaller and less mature markets.\n\nHowever, these are not apple-to-apple comparisons as each city differs in size, geography, economic condition and so on. For instance, when Beijing hosted the 2008 Olympics, China was in the midst of an economic boom, which benefited the property market.\n\nIn contrast, property prices in London dropped prior to the 2012 Olympics. Although this can be mainly attributed to the global financial crisis and the eurozone debt crisis, London's property prices did not recover to the 2005 post- Olympics announcement level until a year after the Games.\n\nSo how will Japan fare leading up to the 2020 Olympics?\n\nThere are a few positive demand drivers. Firstly, interest rate in Japan is among the world's lowest. Inexpensive senior debt can be obtained from Japanese megabanks at 50-70 per cent loan-to-value. With the Bank of Japan continuing to pump money into the economy, the low interest rate environment is expected to stay which could spur demand for property.\n\nSecondly, Japan's inexpensive and readily available debt financing produces one of the highest yield gaps in the world. Although a low yield indicates a higher real estate price, the yield spread that investors enjoy over interest rates offers the allure to invest in Japan properties. Over the past decade, Tokyo has consistently offered attractive yield spreads among major global cities (see Exhibit 1).\n\nBeing the second-largest property investment market after the US, the size of Japan's institutional grade real estate market is estimated to be worth around US$2.7 trillion as at 2012.\n\nThis constitutes 10 per cent of the world's total real estate investment universe, making Japan too big a market to ignore. But foreign investors should note that the investment size for individual assets may not be as large as that in their home countries. This is because many Japanese properties are of smaller sizes compared to many other countries.\n\nIn 2012, Japan was ranked third, after the US and China, for having the highest number of Fortune Global 500 companies in the country. Tokyo alone has 48 such companies, the highest among all major cities globally.\n\nGiven its mature economy and advanced infrastructure, Japan will continue to be a preferred destination for international companies to set up their operations. This may fuel demand in the property market, especially the commercial sector.\n\nBased on this, the allure of Japan's real estate sector was in place before the Olympics came into the picture. The Games only serves as a catalyst to further boost market sentiment. It is certainly not a key factor that will lift property prices for a sustainable period, nor is it an essential element in enticing property investors to jump on the bandwagon. At most, the Olympics creates a \"steroidal boost\" to property prices, especially in the Tokyo Bay area, which is the venue for the Olympics.\n\nIn short, even without the boost from the Olympics, Japan is undergoing a major turnaround. The beacon of light in the form of Abenomics has helped to inject market confidence, kickstart growth and hopefully will end decades of economic stagnation.\n\nIf the momentum continues, there may be potential for capital upside in the near future. Historically, land prices have lagged the stock market. For instance, the stock market peaked in 1989 while land prices only peaked two years later in 1991. (See Exhibit 2)\n\nLand prices are now 66 per cent and 22 per cent below the peak in 1989 and the pre-global financial crisis level, respectively.\n\nShould the economy continue to improve, demand for real estate could rise in tandem. Demand from foreign investors may also run high, as Mr Abe's policies are favourable to foreign investment. As there is a high possibility for real estate prices to improve, potential investors should time their investment strategy accordingly so as to catch Japan's property upcycle.\n\nThe writers are adviser for Japan Business Development Unit at OrangeTee, and the head of research and consultancy at OrangeTee, respectively.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The White Paper is expected to be released next month.\n\nHong Kong is also expected to reform its funds framework to allow the establishment of open-ended investment companies (OEICs), to encourage more funds to set up bases in Hong Kong.\n\nMany global asset managers have set up operations here, but their fund vehicles are likely to be domiciled offshore in jurisdictions such as the Cayman Islands, Dublin or Luxembourg. The survey involved focus group discussions with 21 companies, which included five of the top 10 asset managers in Singapore. The respondents' combined global assets under management was about US$1.2 trillion.\n\nThe study found that managers agreed the current regime is not conducive to efficient fund operations. Some pitfalls include the lack of alternative financial statement reporting frameworks, the lack of investor privacy and the lack of a variable capital structure.\n\nAbout 90 per cent of respondents agreed to having an OEIC structure. An \"overwhelming majority\" were open to launching their next fund in Singapore if such a new framework was introduced.\n\nMost managers felt that the current company law creates complications and is not suitable for fund companies. Most also felt that there is a need for a separate legal fund framework to cater for various investment funds - for instance, a separate funds law for traditional (retail) investors and for non-traditional strategies including hedge funds and private equity funds.\n\nIn a paper on the survey findings, PwC said the concept of a legal entity structure and investment funds law vehicle should be distinct and separate. This is the model followed by Luxembourg, and 46 per cent of respondents alluded to or recommended that model. Almost all the respondents think the proposed investment fund law should allow for umbrella-like structures with underlying sub-funds.\n\n\"... a careful evaluation of the Luxembourg model should be done, as the many years of hindsight and evidence of its success will help in developing and implementing a new funds law framework in Singapore,\" said PwC.\n\nRespondents felt there was a need for funds to have their own financial reporting framework. Most also felt that funds should be allowed the option of using any of the current international reporting standards.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

HSH Nordbank has an additional nine billion euros in a restructuring unit, or bad bank, Mr Nies-wandt said.\n\nOne pre-condition for financing new construction is that the vessels meet recent energy efficiency standards. About 90 per cent of the vessels the bank financed are older models, he said, referring to ships built before the financial crisis started in 2008. Since then, high bunker prices and low charter rates have accelerated technological development, he added.\n\nAs of January 2015, shipping lines must comply with low sulphur fuel regulations in North Europe, the US and Canada, obliging them to buy more expensive fuel or equip vessels with equipment to cut exhaust fumes.\n\nThis probably will result in more ship insolvencies in the next 12 months than in the previous, especially among companies with older, less competitive vessels that face additional costs meeting new environmental regulations, the executive said.\n\n\"There have hardly been any insolvencies of shipping companies, but what we have seen is insolvencies of closed-end shipping funds that have hit individual shipping companies to a greater or lesser extent,\" Mr Nieswandt said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Singapore has linked borrowers' maximum debt levels to their incomes and raised stamp duties and capital gains taxes, while Hong Kong has increased minimum down payments six times in less than three years and in February doubled stamp-duty taxes for all properties over HK$2 million (S$321,403).\n\n\"The property curbs in Singapore and Hong Kong have stymied and paralysed the market,\" Mr Eshelby said. \"Buyers are disenchanted with the local markets so they are looking overseas now.\"\n\nPrices in central London are estimated to climb 25 per cent in the next five years, Mr Eshelby said. London home prices have \"massively outperformed\" the rest of the UK over the past five years, he said. Meanwhile, prices in other parts of the UK are still not back to where they were in 2008, he said.\n\n\"It is possible London will do less well, but not by much,\" Mr Eshelby said. \"There are millions of high-net-worth individuals in the world and there are thousands of new homes in London,\" which suggests a continued imbalance between supply and demand, he said.\n\nLuxury homes in central London have been the best performing in the UK since at least 2009, rising more than 60 per cent from their low that year, according to broker Knight Frank LLP. Home prices in central London's most expensive neighbourhoods rose 6.8 per cent in October from a year earlier, the slowest pace since December 2009, as asking prices deterred buyers, according to an index compiled by Knight Frank.\n\nLand Securities will start marketing its 170-unit residential project - part of a 5.5 acre (2.2 hectare), \u00a32.2 billion (S$4.4 billion) development of offices, retail, shops and homes in the Victoria area - early next year, Mr Eshelby said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

But more needs to be done for the global integrated supply chain manager and processor of agricultural produce and food ingredients to keep itself on an even keel.\n\nThe group finds itself better fortified after a year of restructuring. Profit margins have improved. And initiatives announced so far will release $96.9 million in capital gain and $368.6 million in cash.\n\nThe firm has also generated positive free cash flow - the first time in four years for a seasonally weak quarter.\n\nIts executive director of finance and business development A Shekhar told analysts and reporters: \"We're very pleased that we're striking the right notes on both objectives of profit growth as well as free cash-flow generation.\"\n\nThe first quarter results made for a \"good, steady start\" to the year, especially as the bottom line increased despite flat volumes and lower revenue on weaker commodity prices.\n\nBut scratch a little deeper beneath the surface, and there remains some causes for concern in Olam's results.\n\nIts net gearing remained at 1.93 times as net debt levels stayed unchanged. The gearing ratio is within the firm's internal limit of two times, but in times of higher commodity prices - which would result in a need for more working capital - this limit could be breached on occasions, Olam conceded.\n\nAt the same time, the interest expense that the firm is incurring on its debt is not included in the free cash flow definition it has adopted - that of free cash flow to firm (FCFF).\n\nUsing this measure, Olam generated positive free cash flow of $46 million in the first quarter, compared with the negative free cash flow of $706.8 million in the corresponding period last year.\n\nBut when interest expenses are taken into account, the number turns negative. Free cash flow to equity (FCFE), a measure more relevant for stock investors, was a negative $117.2 million, although this was much improved from the negative $844.3 million last year.\n\nOlam plans to be FCFF-positive at the end of the new financial year, a target it brought forward by a year after its strategic review in April.\n\nIt remains on track to do so, it said, through higher operating cash flow from existing businesses, a lower pace of capital expenditure and initiatives such as the sale-and-leaseback transactions and divestments to unlock value from past investments.\n\nTo be FCFE-positive - necessary to improve the comfort levels of investors - will, however, take a few more years.\n\nThis will be achieved by FY2016, Olam chief executive officer Sunny Verghese told The Business Times last Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, the question of whether Olam will be able to divest part of its stake in the capital-intensive Gabon fertiliser project remains. Olam had invested in the urea-based fertiliser plant in western Africa in November 2010. While it estimated the cost to be at US$1.3 billion, the World Bank has placed the costs at between US$1.5 billion and US$2 billion.\n\nThe investment was also one of nine cited by Muddy Waters, which said little progress had been made on the plant.\n\nOlam now plans to cut its 80 per cent stake to below 50 per cent. The firm has spent S$141.2 million so far on dredging works and developing the site for construction, but will be capping its spending on the project at S$150 million until there is further progress.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr Verghese said two groups of investors were doing due diligence on the project, and that whether the negotiations will come to pass will have a bearing on Olam's success in the execution of its new strategy.\n\nTo the firm's credit, much work has been done to achieve its latest results since its strategic review ended less than a year ago. These include two sale-and-leaseback transactions of its almond orchards in the United States and Australia, the sale of a basmati rice mill in India and a cotton gin in Australia, and the divestment of a stake in a noodle-manufacturing plant.\n\nIn particular, the amount it will cost Olam to lease the almond orchards through the sale-and-leaseback transactions will be lower than the cost of its long-term debt, hence improving overall returns to the firm, Mr Verghese said.\n\nOlam has also restructured four business units. It has:\n\nTo enhance the communication of its results to its stakeholders, Olam unveiled a new results format last Thursday, doing away with its previous performance metrics of gross and net contribution in favour of the more universal Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation); it also added a management and discussion analysis segment.\n\nThese represent a good start. But the firm remains a work in progress. Like a large ship that needs time to re-calibrate its direction, it will be a long while more before it is able to reduce its gearing level and turn FCFE-positive - and thereby lay to rest anxiety in the market over its stock once and for all.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

What makes for an effective social media strategy, in handling both good news and bad?\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 17, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nChris Comer\n\nCEO and Property Developer\n\nCastlewood Group\n\nIF you don't exist on the Web today, you simply don't exist. Decisions are influenced by information on the Web. Castlewood Group has harnessed these beliefs. Our Web presence is our \"window on the world\".\n\nSocial media is neither a luxury nor an entertaining diversion; it is a very important spoke in the marketing wheel. There is no short-cut strategy; it's long haul. Each social media platform has its own quirks and pace, and your contributions must follow the language. All news, good or bad, requires content creation and communication. You need dedicated resources in place 24/7 to participate successfully.\n\nLow Lee Yong\n\nCEO & Founder\n\nMHC Medical Network\n\nTHE new TGIF (Twitter, Google, iPhone and Facebook) generation is fickle with their news consumption, and have a very short attention span. It is impossible to predict what goes viral for them - good or bad. I will be lying if I say we got this figured out. That being the case, there cannot be a SOP (standard operating procedure) in crisis management as each situation differs from another. But TGIFs tend to believe social media more because of its immediacy and perceived independence, compared to traditional media. For a start, businesses should build up their brand goodwill on social media so that when crisis strikes, what is communicated through these channels will not be seen as afterthoughts.\n\nCharlie Foo\n\nVice-President, Asia-Pacific\n\nBrocade\n\nJUST like fire, social media can be a good servant but a bad master. We now live in an era of transparency and greater accountability where information can be accessed anytime, anywhere and in real time. Enterprises must come to terms with this reality, and institute standard processes, best practices and tools to handle social chatter and respond promptly to unfavourable viewpoints and sentiment. Data analytics tools can help automate the process and enable an organisation to address an issue quickly before it turns into a crisis. Enterprises should also have a clear and lawful set of social media policy and guidelines in place to manage employees' social media usage and the potential impact on their reputation.\n\nArvind Agarwalla\n\nCEO\n\nFACT Software International Pte Ltd\n\nOUR in-house design team has created a crisp corporate website, in line with our communications and branding strategy. The site is updated regularly for the public - no one wishes to read yesterday's news.\n\nSince we are a B2B (business-to-business) company, there is limited scope for Facebook engagement. My Twitter account relates to personal branding. We are experiencing better results on LinkedIn in engaging with our stakeholders.\n\nTo sum up, the social media strategy is integral to our operations - it is a full-time job. To think of it any other way would be dangerous. The key is to respond, not react.\n\nDane Anderson\n\nVice-President, Research Director,\n\nAsia-Pacific Region Manager\n\nForrester Research\n\nWE believe that the only true competitive advantage in this Age of the Customer is to be customer-obsessed. As our customers increasingly lead \"always connected\" lifestyles, we strongly encourage our employees to be active on social media, regularly connecting with customers and widening their networks. We also build into their performance reviews, social metrics on blogs as well as activity on platforms such as Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nIn times of crisis, affected customers want to be regularly updated so the speed of communication needs to be even more frequent. But more important than that, the principles of consistent, clear and transparent online and offline communication are critical to ensure that customers feel that they can continue to trust the brand.\n\nPaul Endacott\n\nSouth-East Asia Managing Director\n\nAmbition\n\nWITH the popularity of social media and its increased importance as part of a marketing strategy, we now see a greater emphasis on our corporate Web presence. That is because Web presence is the \"shop front\" of a company and, in this digital age, usually the first point of contact between an organisation and a consumer.\n\nWe recognise that a mismanaged Web presence will have a negative impact on our company image and employer brand, and having an effective online strategy is critical to maximising commercial opportunities. When everything is online and the audience has a wider platform to lend their voice, organisations have to be transparent and maintain integrity when it comes to dealing with information and news, whether good or bad. How a company conducts itself when communicating or dealing with issues will not escape the eyes of the public, and this needs to be properly managed in a fast and transparent manner.\n\nMax Loh\n\nCountry Managing Partner\n\nErnst & Young LLP\n\nTHE use of social media must be based on the principles of transparency, accuracy and timeliness when delivering information - be it good or bad news - so as to maintain the trust of the audience. Social media use must be purpose-driven.\n\nAt EY, we leverage such platforms at the corporate and individual leadership level to build both the EY brand and personal brand of our leaders in the market, and drive conversations with a wide spectrum of stakeholders from clients to recruits.\n\nSocial media is a double-edged sword, hence having a strategy, policy and governance for its use is critical. Leading companies create social media strategies that are aligned with business objectives which include measurement plans; develop enterprise-wide policies to guide employee usage; and educate and train staff to operate safely and effectively in social media.\n\nTony Ang\n\nManaging Director\n\nAedas Architects Singapore\n\nTHIS is the Web Age. Information and news go viral in seconds, which pushes us to think thoroughly before designing. It is important that the actual buildings stay faithful to the original concepts because what we design may be seen by many in an instant. The Web then helps improve and define our work.\n\nSocial media, on the other hand, allows us to establish and enhance our relationship with our global following. It offers a connecting platform for publishing updates, sharing news and exchanging ideas. We have to be engaging and reactive, informing people that we are willing to be acceptive.\n\nSeah Kian Peng\n\nCEO (Singapore)\n\nNTUC Fairprice Co-operative Ltd\n\nSOCIAL media provides an organisation with another platform to engage with its stakeholders and the public at large. It is an important presence that facilitates communication and engagement. Given its reach and pervasiveness, positive or negative issues can spread and escalate very quickly. Messaging in social media must therefore focus on building social capital and trust - and in turn, become a trusted source where people can verify information from.\n\nNTUC FairPrice recognises the strength of social media. We were one of the first retailers in Singapore to start a Facebook community, which currently has about 99,000 fans,and to initiate mobile applications to provide services such as grocery shopping and wine pairing.\n\nFor the uninitiated, social media can appear daunting but it serves as a communication platform where valuable feedback can be sought and also quickly acted upon. I am glad we started our social media presence early in 2009; we have not looked back since.\n\nLionel Lim\n\nPresident, Asia-Pacific and Japan\n\nCA Technologies\n\nTHIS is a new connected world. CA Technologies has embraced social media in all interactions with our customers, partners and employees globally. Never before have we had such a communications platform enabling so many new ways to share thoughts, ideas, stories and feedback.\n\nAs social media is inherently transparent and shareable, companies need to know how to embrace both good and bad conversations. We harness social media channels in an integrated way, where we listen in to what our internal and external stakeholders are saying, as well participate in conversations.\n\nToday, we are building social media elements into all our communication and marketing campaigns to engage and support our customers. This has truly helped us become more responsive and engaged in a region that is so digitally connected and socially interactive.\n\nPhilip Brett\n\nPresident, South & South-east Asia\n\nTBWA\\Asia-Pacific\n\nAS an international communications company, we are intimately involved in guiding the online presence of our clients, and there are some golden rules of engagement from a social media viewpoint. The key in effective online management lies in timely, honest and open communication, be it positive or negative news; indeed, even more so if there is a need to manage bad news. If an organisation is at fault, there should be an immediate response to acknowledge the situation. Internally, it is crucial to appoint a community manager empowered to take charge in the event of a crisis, the go-to person that everyone can quickly identify. That way, timely effective responses can ensure that the ball always remains firmly in the organisation's court.\n\nRichard Hong\n\nCEO\n\nT\u00dcV S\u00dcD PSB\n\nOUR business is about testing, auditing, certification and inspection. As a B2B business, social media is an important tool for us to communicate with the public and our customers directly. We understand the viral influence of this hyper trend, and have put in place a robust policy to ensure that we use it effectively. We have embraced Facebook and Twitter to educate the public about the latest safety and quality standards, our thought leadership on issues affecting society today and, of course, about what we do.\n\nIn our opinion, an informed public makes a knowledgeable public, who will in turn demand higher levels of quality and safety from their vendors and suppliers. This will ultimately raise industry benchmarks. In the event of negative publicity or circumstance, open, honest and timely communication with the public and our customers is key. Social media is a good channel to keep them in the loop and assure them that we are on top of things, thereby avoiding speculation and dissemination of inaccurate information.\n\nJulien Le Noble\n\nManaging Director\n\nCME Group, Head of Asia-Pacific\n\nCME Group was the pioneer among exchanges in using social media. Since 2007, we have been actively using these tools to help us educate our audiences about our products, services and the crucial role of risk management. Social media allows us to be relevant to our followers as we engage in real time. For instance, we launched our Weibo account two years ago and our Japanese Twitter account in September. These allow us to talk and listen to people in those countries and demonstrate that we not only want to share information but we also are there to listen. For us, social media is about being in close proximity to, and deeply engaged with, our many stakeholders in a timely manner.\n\nChris Wei\n\nGroup CEO\n\nGreat Eastern Holdings\n\nAT Great Eastern, we have a very open approach to social media as a two-way communication channel. Over the past two years, we have embraced many different channels from Facebook to Pinterest and LinkedIn across the region. In today's world, we believe that these are essential communication channels for Great Eastern to engage with our customers and deliver on our brand promise. Harnessing social media has enabled Great Eastern to obtain real-time feedback and deeper insights into our customers' needs, enabling us to make more timely and proactive improvements across our customer touchpoints.\n\nWe have found social media to be a powerful tool in increasing our visibility, building relationships with our customers as well as in sharing ideas, knowledge and information. A recent example of how we connected with our users in real time was for the Great Eastern Women's Run where we posted regular updates to the 14,000 participants prior to the start of the race. As a result, we achieved a very good turnout despite the challenging weather conditions.\n\nOur Great Eastern social media strategy is anchored on ensuring consistency in branding and messaging; creating quality content as well as adopting a listening-and-responding approach. Above all, we place priority on transparency and honesty in our communication.\n\nIn a world where words travel in seconds thanks to social media, companies must be prepared to handle situations at lightning speed. It is essential for crisis communications plans to include messaging via the various social media platforms should the need arise.\n\nDhirendra Shantilal\n\nBoard Director & Head, Asia-Pacific\n\nFircroft\n\nAN effective social media strategy keeps up with the pace of news. Prompt responses and interactions on these platforms are critical in allowing the company to generate interest for positive news and to handle arising issues in a timely manner. More importantly, an effective strategy would deliver consistent branding for the company and enhance corporate communications for its stakeholders.\n\nAt Fircroft, the team has effectively leveraged on social media platforms to articulate its corporate developments, as well as featuring topical and engaging blog items on engineering work from its website, which sees 100,000 unique visitors a month. Our Facebook and Twitter pages have also been gaining a steady following.\n\nShawn Balakrishnan\n\nGeneral Manager\n\nThe Hoffman Agency Singapore\n\nAS a global communications agency, we have been managing both our clients' and our company's corporate presence in the media for decades. With the surge of social media, it is no surprise that we have been seeing demand for reputation management services on the Web for our clients. Indeed, many companies are eager to jump on the bandwagon but are ill-prepared to deal with a crisis online.\n\nAt The Hoffman Agency, we take special attention to create protocols for crises and appoint community managers who are well-trained to deal with them. For example, there should be an agreed set of social media guidelines for community managers to respond to any situation within a stipulated time (within an hour for most cases). Community managers should also be culturally-sensitive and possess the relevant skill sets to relay information with accuracy and tact. Social media is indeed a double-edged tool for companies and should not be taken lightly. When correctly used, the benefits are tremendous for the brand.\n\nHari Krishnan\n\nManaging Director\n\nLinkedIn Asia Pacific & Japan\n\nCONTENT is king and relevance is its chief strategist. Bill Gates' first LinkedIn Influencer post underscores how relevant content drives conversations. Within 48 hours, it generated over a million page views.\n\nCompanies leveraging social media should fully understand the context of each social platform. For example, over three million companies use LinkedIn to engage a community in a professional context, to elevate their corporate brands.\n\nWhile a benefit is real-time dialogue, companies need to sustain it by being authentic and \"always on\", particularly when communicating bad news.\n\nSuccessful companies \"listen\" to conversations and deploy analytics to make content even more relevant. Done well, your content can go viral and you can strengthen your bond with multiple stakeholders.\n\nThomas Zilliacus\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman & CEO\n\nYuuZoo Corporation\n\nYUUZOO Corporation is a global provider of dedicated e-commerce enabled social networks for companies. MANY companies have a very low level of understanding of the importance of their own dedicated social network. This is alarming in view of the very rapid growth of social media, e-commerce and m-commerce.\n\nMost young consumers already communicate and make their buying decisions within social networks. Companies that do not understand this and do not have a complete social media strategy stand the risk of not only losing market share, they - in many cases - risk disappearing all together. The future is already here; companies must make sure that they understand what is required and create the solutions to stay in control.\n\nLee Fook Chiew\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nInstitute of Singapore Chartered Accountants (ISCA)\n\nTO meet our members' expectations in this digital age, we strive for timely communications. Apart from our corporate website, we have an ISCA mobile app that provides real-time updates and have a presence on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, Blogger and Google+. These channels enable ISCA to engage our members in a more personal way.\n\nFor example, we held a Facebook Chat for students and aspiring accountants to understand transitional arrangements for the Singapore Qualification Programme. To celebrate our 50th anniversary this year, we ran a photo contest on Facebook. Recently, we held a Google+ Hangout on Air session with ISCA members to dialogue with ISCA president Ernest Kan.\n\nOur social and digital channels allow us to be immersed in the digital conversation that is taking place 24/7. We engage in social listening to understand our members' needs, using the knowledge to craft relevant, exclusive content.\n\nTo ISCA, the digital sphere is not just a means to increase the number of digital connections with members but part of a holistic, integrated strategy to create a digital customer experience that builds brand equity, member engagement and loyalty.\n\nDavid Low\n\nCEO\n\nFuturistic Store Fixtures Pte Ltd\n\nTHE strength of social media is undeniable, given that the world today is wired 24/7. It is imperative to have a Web presence for any entity, especially one that engages in global business. The extent of usage, however, varies across industries.\n\nFuturistic Store Fixtures is largely a brick-and-mortar business where physical facilities and real-time human touch far supersede virtual experience. We have in recent times jazzed up our corporate website to generate greater targeted traffic with refreshing visual treats and news flasheswhich encourage repeat hits as well as to facilitate search engine optimisation. Interactions with users is restricted only to registered clients as an attempt to control Web activity within corporate boundaries. We have also key administrators to oversee all online portals - corporate website, corporate Facebook page and corporate LinkedIn account - with strict social media etiquette.\n\nFor businesses that engage heavily in social media, especially the B2C (business-to-consumer) industry, good online governance and strict protocols are mandatory and key to effective deployment. A team of Web-savvy public relations trained administrators will be needed to safeguard the company's interest and ensure quick turnaround in both seizing opportunities and crisis management.\n\nLeong Soo Yee\n\nHead\n\nACCA Singapore\n\nA RECENT report entitled Digital Darwinism: Thriving in the face of technology change by ACCA (the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants) and IMA (Institute of Management Accountants) identified social technologies as one of the top 10 technologies with the potential to drastically reshape the business landscape.\n\nOrganisations must explore the possibilities offered by social media and \"enterprise\" social tools that can enhance decision-making and productivity, and build brand loyalty. They need to continuously innovate to keep up with the digital revolution. Compelling content and the ability to present it in creative ways are key elements of an effective social media strategy.\n\nGood news should be supported by credible facts and reasoned analysis. In managing bad news, organisations should always be prompt in addressing customers' queries and ensure transparency in providing information.\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nTHE proliferation of social media today has made it all the more imperative for companies to actively manage their corporate presence, as well as have strong contingency plans in place for crisis management. At PrimeStaff, our corporate presence extends from a website that is professionally managed and regularly updated, to leveraging on social media as a tool to connect with our clients and job candidates, as we are in the recruitment business.\n\nAn effective social media strategy calls for authenticity, tact and sensitivity. The communication needs to be real as you are, interacting with people on a very direct, personal level. It also requires a good grounding in public relations, as crisis management skills are needed when something goes wrong. For example, when handling a negative situation on social media, timeliness of response is critical as news can go viral at the touch of a button, and the socialsphere can be very unforgiving.\n\nMichael Jenkins\n\nChief Executive\n\nRoffey Park Asia-Pacific\n\nBY not embracing social media, organisations are missing out on a valuable source of conversation and feedback, and may be viewed as out of touch. Any social media strategy must be authentic and specific to your needs so that your organisation retains its identity and stands out from the crowd.\n\nOrganisations need to deepen their understanding about how to develop people who have grown up with social media. These are colleagues who enjoy and use social media extensively and who recognise its (still understated) value in building human relationships. As chief executives, we need to ensure that our social media-savvy staff identify with our goals and that we have a consistent, compelling and generationally sensitive approach to messaging across both digital and traditional communication methods. We also need to relinquish \"control\" over access to social media platforms during work time. Social media is active 24/7 so we need to trust our people and give them access wherever and whenever they need it.\n\nPoh Mui Hoon\n\nGroup CEO\n\nIconz-Webvisions\n\nAS an enterprise business, we use social media as a way of connecting with our stakeholders. For example, we use LinkedIn to not only source for talent but also to provide updates on our corporate activities and offer technology advice. We see social media as an extension of our existing communication platforms, where specific ground rules based on human resource and management policies are already in place.\n\nAll content posted is cleared through rigorous review processes, and only approved spokesmen can communicate on social media. While the control of negative comments can be tricky, we believe that the best approach is to respond quickly and calmly, and to always be open and honest in our communication. Often, it may mean taking the conversation elsewhere - whether e-mail, phone or face-to-face. Just like the offline business world, developing relationships takes time and effort, and the same holds for social media.\n\nAngeli Beltran\n\nManaging Director\n\njobsDB Singapore and Malaysia\n\nJOBSDB has been actively managing our corporate presence on the Web since 1998. From our experience, the best way of handling both good news and bad news on social media is to be authentic, consistent and focused - and in times of strife, speed is of the essence.\n\nWe work hard to develop real connections with our customers and the public by injecting our posts with our personality, values and passion. Our communication strategy is surrounded by the theme \"Let's Explore\" - to encourage people to explore their potential and capabilities through the many opportunities that jobsDB offers. With the Web's reach, it is important that jobsDB remains focused in knowing its followers and having genuine interactions to grow our reach organically. With an approach rooted in authenticity and consistency, we often find our online followers to be the ones amplifying our message by sharing our posts via their personal social media channels.\n\nRiaz Mehta\n\nPresident and Founder\n\nImagine Group\n\nSOCIAL media has given us a direct communication channel with our audience, which is a real asset in the world of content and entertainment. We are currently focused on building communities, and this is enabling us to learn more about what our viewers love about the content that we are creating. In effect we are using social media to amplify the conversation around our shows airing currently, such as The Apartment, as well as increase the global reach of our brands.\n\nI feel that we are still in the infancy of social media with Imagine Group, but I am very excited about the future. The key for us has been forward planning and developing a clear strategy from the outset, defining what social media means for us and our business.\n\nNews, both good and bad, travels like wildfire online so preparation and process is key. When you get this right, the value multipliers are huge - but you do have to be prepared for the negatives as well. The upside for us is that in our industry any news is good news, and social media is the most effective channel to drive this conversation - so we feel we are on a really good thing here.\n\nChristophe Duchatellier\n\nCEO\n\nAdecco Asia\n\nIN today's world, it is crucial to keep content relevant and current. With the rise in social media platforms, organisations have to stay relevant and be prepared for crises as well as understand the benefits of having an engaged and strong following. The key to effective social media strategies is in ensuring that key stakeholders are well-informed and kept in the loop regardless of the news type. Having all employees follow company social networks can be very beneficial. Social media can be advantageous in many ways, such as in helping to build strong corporate culture as well as corporate branding.\n\nLouis Song\n\nSingapore Country Manager\n\nInternational Business Group at Tencent, the company behind the WeChat app\n\nSOCIAL media is not only here to stay, it is spreading beyond desktops and onto mobile platforms. We see signs of this trend as teenagers abandon established social media platforms such as Facebook for newer, innovative mobile social media. At WeChat, we have seen a staggering 1,021 per cent increase in active usage among teens 16 to 19 years old between Q1 and Q3 in 2013.\n\nThe implications of this in the business arena are multifold. To engage well with consumers, partners and employees, businesses need to be able to understand and navigate the mobile social communications space. They also need to start enhancing their digital and communications capabilities to be able to defend their corporate reputation on the digital, mobile front. To do this, companies need to start looking into new processes and training that can help them successfully weld mobile social technologies and remain relevant in the marketplace and with consumers. By proactively investing in building its communications capabilities and delving into this new landscape, business will be able to ensure that they are leading the way rather than playing catch-up with its competition and customers.\n\nJanet Ang\n\nManaging Director\n\nIBM Singapore\n\nIn a new study by IBM's Institute for Business Value, 54% of C-suite executives surveyed said they will need to embrace the use of digital channels to drive customer interactions.\n\nIn Singapore, IBM recently partnered the Institute of Systems Science to set up the first ever Enterprise Social Business Centre of Excellence in Singapore. The centre aims to transform companies into social businesses by leveraging on social media platforms and tools to improve productivity, connect for innovation and create communities for competitive advantage.\n\nCompanies that are successful with social media usually do two things well: they enable a candid dialogue with their stakeholders and offer them meaningful, value-added content.\n\nDavid Crammond\n\nCEO & Founder\n\nMaachu Pte Ltd\n\nSOCIAL media is a news accelerator, and the audience now dictates the urgency of response. Having an effective social media strategy requires the company to have a streamlined decision process around public comment. Traditional top-down decision making requires new skills that first recognises and then leverages on the many social platforms.\n\nMaachu, which has developed the next generation recruitment platform, communicates to all our stakeholders, especially consumers, in a timely manner when we provide information on our products and services. This ensures that we provide them the avenue to make well-informed decisions.\n\nDoina Palici-Chehab\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nAXA Insurance Singapore Pte Ltd\n\nCORPORATE presence online needs to move beyond simply presence. At AXA, some of our popular products can be purchased online, whether on our website or through our partners' websites. Recognising that our stakeholders may also want to interact with us online, we recently started using social media for some of our recruitment needs. This has been effective in giving prospective employees an additional opportunity to interact with us before even applying for a job. Globally, AXA also recently announced the creation of AXA Lab in Silicon Valley, with one of its missions being to connect with Internet leaders. I believe that this will put us in a good position to leverage on innovations online as a Group.\n\nMatthew Overington\n\nRegional Co-Lead, Technology Practice, Asia\n\nHill + Knowlton Strategies\n\nHAVING a social media presence is essentially a commitment to customers, consumers or stakeholders to a conversation. When an organisation chooses to interact via social media, it has an obligation to interact with speed, openness and transparency regardless of positive or negative conversations.\n\nThe most successful social media strategies have two things in common: structure and commitment. Structure is important to ensure that content is engaging and updated regularly, and that interactions with the public are conducted according to guidelines that ensure honesty and transparency. It is important to note that building a presence on the Web is a long-term process, and organisations must ensure that they plan accordingly instead of gunning for quick successes that are not sustainable.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPlan-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\nSocial media, if harnessed appropriately, can help enhance the relationship between a company and its customers. In today's digital age, where almost everyone is connected virtually, having a corporate presence on the Web can help organisations connect and reach out to their virtual community.\n\nOrganisations need to be mindful that just as technology evolves, so do customers. Today's customers are more discerning and will rarely rely on a single source of information. It is therefore important that companies develop a strategy that evolves around their own distinctive brand with authenticity and focus.\n\nWhile it is good to have a presence in as many online portals as possible, community engagement can put a strain on employees. In view of this, targeted choices should be made based on the company's brand elements, to ensure that the online portals align with the organisation's vision and mission. Along with this, companies need to be transparent and clear on what they are trying to communicate. This applies to admitting mistakes. In doing so, it makes the organisation seem \"human\" and will help earn that element of trust that can make a difference between an organisation's success and failure.\n\nBenjamin Tan\n\nGroup CEO\n\nYolk / Grey Group\n\nTHE undeniable truth is that in today's digital age no company can avoid this. So it will do better in dealing with this head-on as both a potential banana skin as well as an opportunity to connect.\n\nHave a crisis management system in place so that crises are handled fast and effectively. This entails identifying stakeholders and getting them involved in designing and buying-in to a process workflow that is defined for more common scenarios. Prepare responses to scenarios in advance when there is no pressure. This will ensure the right, well thought-out response because it is just as important not to overeact. Utilise tools to be alerted to any potential crisis situations - there are many social listening tools out there where you can set up alerts for, say, a sudden upsurge in mentions of your brand or products. Look for signs. For example, if you have a relationship with key influencers, sometimes they will be the ones to give you a heads-up. Take interest in your own brand. The fact of the matter is, a lot of brands leave it up to third parties to engage on social media with customers without truly embracing it themselves. Nobody else can or should be able to speak for your business or brand better than you. If you treat your fans right, you may notice that when things go wrong, often they will be the first ones who come to your defence, and in numbers too.\n\nSteve Melhuish\n\nCo-Founder and Group Chief Executive Officer\n\nPropertyGuru\n\nTHE cold hard truth about companies with social media and website presence is that this digital function is still very much in its nascent stage and, at best, a corporate online entity borne out of good governance. Companies run their online assets perfunctorily rather than as a means to refreshing and extending their database and building revenue streams. Company leaders still adopt a brick-and-mortar attitude to raising equity value and prefer face-to-face interactions with stakeholders and sealing mega deals in the traditional boardroom realm. It is inconceivable to maintain strong investor relations through a social media portal that is deemed more for entertaining and personal updates. At the end of the day, issuing company announcements in print to the press and shareholders is the preferred route of ensuring sustainable counter performance. Not micro-blogs or postings on social media sites! Operating a successful corporate social media platform has to be larger than a brand marketer's lofty dream. This is a communications platform that companies are hesitant to take on. That is because true engagement and conversations on social media just does not happen. Clicking \"Likes\" and commenting on a posting has no inherent value but is just a superficial, social response to something of entertainment value - so \"style\" to amuse social onlookers rather than substance rules the social sphere. Because people talk to people and not to a social media postings, I go back to companies developing positive connections with consumers and stakeholders. This is never based on a traditional advertisement model but through offering true value that fulfils needs and aspirations. Singapore is run very much in a controlled corporate and media environment with a strong culture of checks and balances. Social media crises would occur more in the west because of total corporate liberalisation.\n\nThirumalai Chandroo\n\nChairman/CEO\n\nModern Montessori International Group\n\nSOCIAL media is seen as a double-edged sword by most companies. Due to the potential risks involved, many companies remain undecided about leveraging on social media as a crucial business resource. We need to realise that once we begin real-time engagement with our customers, we no longer have a grasp on the way that our brand image takes. To ensure that social media strategies are effective, it is important to identify and communicate the evolution of social media within the enterprise. Social media efforts are unlikely to increase brand commitment and customer relationships of a company overnight, so there should be continuous dedication and regular evaluation of its effectiveness on marketing strategies, customer relations and sales and promotion if the company decides to launch a social media marketing campaign. Social media does produce many benefits and increased profits to a company if done strategically. As an organisation, it is important to comprehend all aspects of social media for your company and implement a tactical plan. The organisation's adaptive approach for reputation issues should be clearly defined, just as any other risk management process within the company. With apposite planning, chances for social media success should increase.\n\nEric Hoh\n\nVice-President, Asia South Region\n\nSymantec\n\nSOCIAL media is an integral part of any marketing strategy and fast becoming a strategic tool for engaging customers. However, it is important to be aware of what is being circulated in the Internet as inappropriate content can sometimes result in backlash from your customers that not only impact a company's reputation but also affect sales.\n\nTo execute an effective social media strategy, a first step is real-time monitoring and listening so that you are clued in to the latest conversations, crisis or otherwise, and assess how the situation impacts your industry, and when the dialogue has moved on. It is also important to review scheduled posts from both corporate and personal accounts and avoid communications that could be considered insensitive or capitalising on a tragedy. Always evaluate the situation, particularly in issues management as early details are often inaccurate. Be it good or bad news, it's essential to be prepared to react quickly. Be factual, human and sensitive when sharing information on social media platforms and your customers will respect you for it.\n\nAndrew Dobbins\n\nGroup Vice President\n\nVerizon Enterprise Solutions\n\nAll companies need to expect and accept that any presence on the social media is an open invitation to both praise and criticism. How companies choose to manage the risk is the key to a successful social media strategy. Understanding your audience is the first step. Verizon is in the business of driving open a new, connected world of opportunity for business and society through industry-specific enterprise technology solutions, hence our social media audience is vastly different from say, a retail business'. Through all our social media assets, and media as a whole - blogs, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, Slideshare sites - our key concern is to engage all our stakeholders via news, opinions and information. In return, we hope to encourage a two-way dialogue. It is important for us to be able to engage with customer and industry discussion as it happens, embrace all feedback, and take it back into the organisation and continue the conversation.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The residential rate is half that level, at 6 per cent.\n\nLawmakers, inundated by their constituents' requests to fight the hike, reckon that assessments would go up by 100 to 300 per cent.\n\nBut DBKL maintains that the hike is justified because valuations have not been revised for 21 years even as property values have gone up significantly, as have the council's operating costs.\n\nRate-payers counter that revisions ought to be more gradual, every five years, for example.\n\nFurthermore, owners - many of them retirees - say that they do not benefit from higher property values as most occupy their homes, and believe that the proliferation of new developments should have added to DBKL's revenues.\n\nSlamming the council for its lack of consultation, they complain that its services have not improved as roads continue to be full of potholes and drains clogged, while many parts of Kuala Lumpur are dirty.\n\nThe fault does not entirely lie with DBKL since quite often, a newly resurfaced road is messed up when a utility company decides to lay down new water pipes or telco cables, and its independent contractor does a shoddy patch-up job.\n\nIn a column, tycoon Tong Kooi Ong wrote that DBKL's expected total revenue for 2013 of RM1.62 billion more than covered the RM1.4 billion budgeted in operating expenses. Although it anticipates incurring RM782 million in development expenses, about half of it would be paid from federal government funds. It is unfair to overly tax KL residents, he said, as they also pay Putrajaya hefty corporate and personal taxes.\n\nAn increase in assessment payable is likely to result in higher inflation and rentals. However, because the supply of commercial space and high-end residential units in Kuala Lumpur outstrips demand, rental hikes might be smaller.\n\nIn the past five to six years, many high-end apartments have mushroomed in Malaysia's biggest city, fuelled by strong demand on the back of low interest rates, easy credit and financing schemes such as Dibs (developer interest bearing scheme), and more relaxed real property gains tax (RPGT).\n\nBut the party could be coming to an end as RPGT rates have been doubled and Dibs has been banned to the delight of those such as Chang Kim Loong, honorary secretary-general of the National House Buyers Association (HBA), who blame speculators for ramping prices up.\n\nMr Chang said that an assessment payable increase would unduly penalise the majority of private home owners who have one or two properties. \"If City Hall wishes to increase the (assessment) for private homes . . . HBA proposes a hike of not more than 10 per cent.\"\n\nOwners who do not agree with the new assessment have about a month to object in writing.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The mother of two and her husband will pay 43 per cent more for a similar-sized apartment, moving their children away from friends after disagreeing with their landlord over terms of a new lease.\n\n\"This is insane,\" said Ms El-Said, who pays 8,750 dirhams (S$3,000) per month for an apartment on the Palm Jumeirah man-made island. \"It's like you have to move house every two years. You feel no stability in where you live and you're always at the mercy of landlords whose sole interest is making more money.\"\n\nRent increases and the conflicts that go with them are climbing in the city of about 2.2 million, rattling a workforce that's mostly foreign, as a rebounding property market and a surging economy embolden landlords. Buying a home has become more difficult after the central bank damped lending for most of the year by proposing tighter mortgage restrictions and imposing new transaction fees.\n\nRents rose by 15 per cent for apartments and 14 per cent for single-family homes on average in the past year, Jones Lang LaSalle wrote in an October report, citing data compiled by researcher Reidin.com. Salaries for non-government employees increased 5.6 per cent in the United Arab Emirates during that time, according to a survey of more than 200 companies by Mercer LLC, a New York-based consulting firm.\n\n\"Dubai should be worried about rising rents because there is no upside to the government or society,\" said Farouk Soussa, the London-based head of Middle East economics at Citigroup Global Markets Ltd. \"It goes against Dubai's best economic interest because it erodes its competitiveness.\"\n\nLegal disputes over leases have jumped since the property market began to rebound, Sultan Bin Mejren, director-general of Dubai's Land Department said in September. The regulator in September said it will create a rental dispute tribunal to simplify the way disagreements are handled and more than double the capacity to about 250 cases a week. The purpose of the centre is to achieve \"social and economic stability for all concerned\", the Land Department said in a statement.\n\nDubai's economy is headed for the fastest expansion in six years as it benefits from an increase in hotel occupancy and manufacturing. Gross domestic product grew 4.9 per cent in the first half, compared with a 4.4 per cent increase in 2012,the statistics office said on Nov 6.\n\nRents are \"definitely becoming a concern for companies as prices have shot up in the past 12 to 18 months\", said Nuno Gomes, who advises businesses on employee compensation for Mercer. \"If things continue at this pace, the allowances that are being provided won't be enough.\"\n\nAnnual rent for a mid-range three-bedroom villa was 212,500 dirhams on average. Rents range from 167,500 dirhams to 338,000 dirhams depending on the quality and location, according to Cluttons LLC. That compares with an average of US$3,862 per month, or US$46,344 per year, in Manhattan, where rents, charged monthly, rose 0.2 per cent last year.\n\nLeasing costs in Dubai rose this year amid expectations that the government would step in to cool the emirate's surging homebuying market. Mortgage lending stalled in the first quarter after the United Arab Emirates central bank said it would cap the value of mortgages taken by foreigners to 50 per cent of a first home's value.\n\nAfter holding talks with lenders, the central bank in October limited mortgages to foreign buyers to 75 per cent of the value of a first home valued at five million dirhams or less. It also capped loans for second homes and barred payments made with credit cards or personal loans. Dubai doubled property sales fees to 4 per cent from 2 per cent in October.\n\nLandlords in Dubai are already getting yields that are twice the global average. Rental income as a percentage of the purchase price ranges from 5 per cent to 6 per cent compared with a world average of 2 per cent to 3 per cent, Goldman Sachs Group said in an Oct 21 report.\n\nDubai's Real Estate Regulatory Agency allows increases of 5 per cent to 10 per cent based on an index that tracks the values across the city. Conflicts arise when the owners try to get tenants to move out to achieve a bigger increase, Ludmila Yamalova, a partner at law firm HPL Yamalova & Plewka JLT, said.\n\nFaced with a rent increase they couldn't accept, Ms El-Said and her husband agreed to vacate the house in one year. Their new home, also on the Palm Jumeirah island, will cost 45,000 dirhams more, plus another 20,000 dirhams in moving costs and fees.\n\n\"This isn't justified because salaries didn't climb anywhere near the rents,\" she said.

She also added that she might have to make frequent trips to London as a result.\n\nMs Ng declined to go on the record when asked why she was suing the investment banking firm.\n\n\"I'm not at liberty to discuss the details of the suit as the solicitors are still working on it,\" she said.\n\nAs for her future plans, Ms Ng said that she was still an independent director at LionGold, and would continue to serve at that company. She also plans to concentrate on her legal practice for the time being.\n\nIn its statement to SGX, Blumont said that it was in the process of identifying a suitable replacement. The commodities company also thanked Ms Ng for her services and contributions as a director.\n\nBlumont and LionGold are part of the infamous trio of penny stocks - Asiasons Capital being the third company - that suffered a crash in their shares after huge rallies in their share prices earlier in the year.\n\nThe fiasco resulted in the Monetary Authority of Singapore saying that it would conduct an extensive review of the share price volatility. The three stocks lost more than $8 billion in combined market value over several trading sessions last month.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That compares with a gain of 1.3 per cent for corporate sukuk from the Gulf Cooperation Council, according to HSBC/Nasdaq Dubai indices. Emirates ordered 150 planes from Boeing Co and 50 from Airbus SAS at this week's Dubai Airshow.\n\nThe airline has exploited Dubai's location to turn the city into an intercontinental hub, linking Europe and the Americas with Asia-Pacific and Africa. The world's largest international carrier said last week that it transported 15 per cent more passengers in the six months to Sept 30 than a year ago after receiving new planes and adding routes. Emirates said in August it's mulling sukuk sales to help finance aircraft purchases.\n\n\"New plane orders result in new routes and more frequent flights,\" Yaser Abushaban, executive director of asset management at Emirates Investment Bank PJSC said last Thursday. \"That higher cash generation means a stronger ability to finance debt.\"\n\nThe carrier's order for the Boeing 777X jets has a list-price value of US$76 billion and that placed with Airbus for 50 A380 superjumbos is worth US$23 billion. Customers typically buy aircraft at a discount.\n\nWhen investing in airline industry debt, \"you are looking for operational efficiency\", Doug Bitcon, a fund manager at Rasmala Investment Bank Ltd, said last Thursday. \"Emirates has that. They have access to a home airport that can run 24 hours, a proactive and supportive government, and room for expansion.\"\n\nEmirates, which isn't rated, transported 21.5 million passengers in their fiscal first half and posted revenue of 39.8 billion dirhams (S$13.5 billion). That compares with about US$6 billion for the same period in 2008.\n\nThe carrier will have space to grow as Dubai last month opened a new airport, Al Maktoum International, that plans to have capacity for 160 million passengers a year. Dubai Airport saw 5.4 million passengers in September, up 13 per cent from a year earlier, according to airport data. The world's busiest hub, Heathrow, handled 6.6 million passengers.\n\nEmirates needs to raise US$4.5 billion in the next financial year to pay for new aircraft, Brian Jeffery, senior vice-president for corporate treasury, said in August. It needs an average of US$5.34 billion a year over the next five years, including 2013, to finance 119 planes, he said. \"If there's more issuance and it gets more frequent, it will impact the paper out there,\" Mr Abushaban said.\n\n\"At some point, the increase in issues starts cannibalising returns on older paper, and that can turn investors away. Demand is strong at the moment but with more issuance that can taper off.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Emirates raised the US$1 billion 2023 sukuk within two months of selling a US$750 million non-Syariah compliant bond. The yield on the earlier bond maturing in February 2025 gained for 11 consecutive days in March as the sukuk was announced, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\"At the back of investor minds, there's always this concern that Emirates will be coming with the next order, and will be tapping the market again,\" Mr Bitcon said. \"If that was not the case, you would see the debt trade a lot tighter.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Across England and Wales, average prices fell by 2.4 per cent.\n\nAs the economy strengthens and the government ramps up property stimulus measures, Rightmove said the underlying recovery remains in place. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said this month its house price index rose to the highest in more than a decade in October.\n\n\"The excitement about Help to Buy's early launch failed to buck the seasonal trend,\" said Miles Shipside, Rightmove director. \"At this time of year it's mainly those with a more pressing need to sell that come to market, driving average asking prices down.\"\n\nOver the past quarter prices in London have risen 3.2 per cent, Rightmove said. From a year earlier, values in the city are up 6.9 per cent, while the national increase is 4 per cent.\n\n\"Estate agents expect a more buoyant 2014 as they pick up early signs of an increase in buyer interest and demand,\" Mr Shipside said. \"This side of Christmas could be the time for eager buyers to hunt out keen sellers and do a deal.\"\n\nRightmove said its survey shows almost a quarter of potential buyers are unaware of Help to Buy's second phase, which expands the government-guaranteed mortgage scheme.\n\nWith the plan facing some criticism that it may overstimulate the market, Prime Minister David Cameron defended it last week, saying it is allowing \"hardworking people\" to get onto the property ladder. More than 2,000 people had been accepted for the scheme, he said.

It also ordered 50 Airbus A380s, the world's biggest passenger plane, worth US$23 billion.\n\nWith demand from other Gulf carriers including Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways, Boeing announced commitments for a total of 259 of the new 777 jet, previously codenamed 777X, worth about US$100 billion at list prices - the largest combined order in its history and confirming earlier Reuters stories.\n\n\"The response to the 777X has been astounding,\" Boeing chairman James McNerney said at a packed news conference to officially launch the new plane, in front of Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum.\n\nGulf airlines are competing with each other for a share of the traffic flooding through the region due to its growing prosperity and strategic location between East and West. And with many recession-hit European airlines strapped for cash, Gulf business is increasingly important to Boeing and Airbus.\n\nThe revamped 777 marks a new front in the battle between the two aircraft manufacturers that dominate the civil aviation industry.\n\nBoeing's new plane is aimed at heading off competition from the largest version of Airbus's A350 in the mini-jumbo market that drives growth and connectivity between continents.\n\nBoeing pledged not to let a dispute with Seattle assembly workers over where the new 777 should be built interfere with its launch, which kicked off the Nov 17-21 Dubai show.\n\nThe US group is looking for a home for the new jet after members of the International Association of Machinists rejected a proposed contract that would have seen Boeing commit to keeping the latest member of the 777 series near Seattle in exchange for restructured benefits.\n\nWith Boeing also agreeing on deals for 30 of its 787 Dreamliners with Etihad and for over 100 of its 737 planes with budget carrier flydubai, the US manufacturer looked on course to defeat Airbus in the battle for orders at the Dubai show.\n\nHowever, as well as the order from Emirates, Airbus announced a deal for 87 aircraft with Etihad which, including options for 30 more, could be worth US$26.9 billion.\n\nThe European group also has a record of springing surprises, and is keen to prevent a smooth lift-off for the new 777.\n\n\"Airbus is desperate to blunt the impact of the 777X,\" said a senior industry source, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nEmirates' A380 order was something of a coup for Airbus, which is under pressure to revive the fortunes of a plane that previously hadn't found any buyers this year and faces a cut in output unless empty 2015 production slots can be filled.\n\nEmirates is already the biggest customer of the A380 and its order for 50 more was at the top end of expectations, and brings its total orders for the plane to 140.\n\nIn a sign of the Gulf's increasing power in the industry, Emirates chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said he was confident of a shift in stance in the West that would allow the group to fly more of its planes to airports there.\n\n\"We are buying a product from their countries. So why would they not allow us to fly to these airports? If they don't, they can take their planes back,\" he said.\n\nBoeing's new 777 comes in two models including what will be the world's longest-distance passenger jet - a 350-seat model to be known as the 777-8 once the aircraft has been launched.\n\nThe larger 777-9 edition, carrying 406 people, will be the main version and be delivered starting 2020.\n\nTogether, the modernised planes call for development of carbon-fibre wings that fold at the tips to fit in the same parking spaces and new engines from General Electric.\n\nAirbus says Boeing has packed in passengers densely to make the revamped aircraft's economics work against its own all-new 350-seat model, the A350-1000, due to enter service in 2017.\n\nIt has launched a campaign for a minimum standard seat width of 45.7cm on long trips, aiming to draw attention to what it says will be the 777's narrower seats. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Its growth rate is slowing, and there is some uncertainty over policy changes that the new team will be introducing. Indonesia is losing its shine because of many difficulties, such as higher inflation and currency depreciation.\n\n\"Compared to the two countries, Singapore is recovering well from its anaemic performance in the past two years and is thus viewed as holding rela-tively better prospects.\"\n\nOf the 166 firms polled from late September to mid-October, 21 per cent named Singapore as the most promising market, 19 per cent chose Indonesia and 15 per cent selected China.\n\nThis contrasts with last year's survey results, where the top spot was held by Indonesia (20 per cent), the second by Malaysia (15 per cent) and the third by China (14 per cent).\n\nEven though one-fifth of respondents believe Singapore to be the most promising market for them, the survey's business prospects indicator showed that overall, companies here remain pessimistic about the next six months - albeit to a lesser degree than they had been a quarter ago.\n\nThe business prospects net balance, which ignores the indifferent to take the difference between the proportion of upbeat and pessimistic firms, was a negative 11 per cent - up just two percentage points from the previous quarter.\n\nStill, business activities continued to improve in Q3 2013, even though results from the quarterly survey showed that performance remained in contraction mode.\n\nSaid Ms Chow: \"Business activities strengthened across all groups of firms in Q3 2013, signalling an imminent turnaround to an expansion path.\"\n\nIndeed, fewer firms registered contracting sales, profits, and orders or new business, compared to the previous quarter.\n\nAfter stagnating for four consecutive quarters, sales picked up in Q3 due to a reduction in the number of firms that encountered lower sales of up to 25 per cent.\n\nBetter profit and orders results were recorded across all firms, whether large or small, local or foreign. Just over half of all respondents said they had business overseas.\n\nThe four indicators tracked by the survey - sales, profits, orders and business prospects - have proved to be correlated with economic growth over the survey's 18-year history.\n\nThe business prospects indicator, lagged a quarter, has shown the closest correlation to GDP (gross domestic product) growth rates. This time round, it predicts growth of between 4.2 and 5.3 per cent in Q4.\n\n\"The predictions indicate that the Singapore economy could expand by 3.5-3.7 per cent for the whole year of 2013, which would be more than double the rate of 1.3 per cent growth in the previous year,\" said Ms Chow.\n\nWhile this is already above the government's full-year growth forecast range of 2.5-3.5 per cent, some economists believe such a growth outcome is possible - especially with recent economic indicators performing better than expected.\n\nSaid UOB economist Francis Tan: \"I certainly think that the results both for Q4 and full year 2013 GDP from the survey is plausible at this stage, especially given that our manufacturing industries' business activities are on an uptrend and the services industries remained robust in growth.\"\n\nIndustrial production for September outstripped even the most bullish of market forecasts to grow 9.3 per cent from a year ago, on the back of a 20 per cent surge in electronics output and a busy time for rig and ship-builders.\n\nAdding to expectations of a better finish to the year was October's PMI reading, which rose to 51.2 from 50.5 in September, signalling a stronger-than-expected pick-up in manufacturing activity.\n\nWith this, Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Chua Hak Bin believes growth momentum could strengthen in Q4, and expects the government to raise its full-year GDP growth forecast to between 3.5 and 4 per cent.\n\nBut OCBC economist Selena Ling has her reservations: \"We are looking at 3.3 per cent for full year 2013 so (the survey's predictions) look a bit high for both the Q4 and full-year growth. While the leading indicators are improving, the US Christmas season orders may not have materialised in a big way, partly due to the fiscal uncertainties over the US partial government shutdown.\"\n\nAdded Barclays economist Joey Chew: \"We think the government may narrow its growth forecast for 2013 to 'around 3.5 per cent', but probably not raise the entire forecast range again just to be cautious and avoid sounding too bullish.\"\n\nNevertheless, DBS economist Irvin Seah, who expects GDP growth to register 3.8 per cent for 2013 and 4 per cent in 2014, said: \"Global economic conditions are improving. Barring any pre-emptive unwinding of loose monetary policy, the developed economies, specially the US and eurozone, remain firmly on their recovery path. China's economic momentum is picking up again. These factors should remain supportive of Singapore's growth outlook in the coming quarters.\"\n\nWith final GDP figures for Q3 due for release this Thursday, the median forecast of 14 economists polled by Bloomberg points to an expansion of 5.3 per cent - ahead of the government's flash estimate of 5.1 per cent year-on-year growth.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 15, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWorking on a holiday mood\n\nTripAdvisor\n\nYOU know the high that you get when you go on a holiday? The staff at TripAdvisor are on that constant high, thanks to the design of their office at Cross Street.\n\n\"People really enjoy working here, it is like being on a vacation while working,\" says Lewis Ng, TripAdvisor's commercial director for business listings.\n\nDesigned by Kyoob-id, the office has plenty of travel elements in it. \"The world is one big playground. We want to emulate a fun environment akin to a travel experience,\" says Maggie Yeo, Kyoob-id's associate director.\n\nThe fun starts when you step into the office. Strips of light-oak timber stretch across the reception ceiling to create a larger-than-life bird cage. A large pair of eyes stares back at you, but that is just Ollie the owl, TripAdvisor's brand mascot, welcoming you into the office. \"The owl icon is not only a feature wall for the reception area, but also separates the reception and the meeting rooms behind it,\" says Tiwe Tan, Kyoob-id's senior designer. The office gets views of Raffles Place, Clarke Quay and the Marina Bay area, so most of the workstations are placed along the circumference to let staff enjoy these views. Meetings and managers' rooms are in the central core.\n\nJust so that no one forgets this is the office of the world's largest travel site, there are always reminders. Instead of plain glass walls, the managers' rooms have frosted decals of well-known travel icons, such as the Statue of Liberty and the Leaning Tower of Pisa on them. Glass partitions that separate the different departments have stickers that resemble passport stamps. Some meeting rooms are named after renowned island destinations such as Bora Bora and Santorini, which are also winners in TripAdvisor's 2013 Travellers' Choice Islands awards.\n\nEven the carpet is not spared, with directional and speed-limit icons worked into the design. And, of course, it would make sense for the office to have a map of the world. This is at the pantry, where a world map collage reminiscent of a travel scrapbook is emblazoned on the wall. Another wall has been set aside for staff to put up their framed travel pictures. The office may have been designed by Kyoob-id, but the 90-strong staff from TripAdvisor played a role too. The company held a photo competition, and two of the best photos of Singapore's skyline have been printed on the walls.\n\nThe directional signs come with quirky names such as Smart Connections and A Click Away From Happiness that were thought up by the staff. The names point to the Mobile Partnerships and Cost Per Click teams respectively.\n\nBefore they moved into this office two months ago, staff were asked for their feedback on what they wanted in their new office. Among the wants were height-adjustable tables, a better stocked pantry, a recreation room and shower area which are now all in place. Mr Ng notes that his colleagues are now spending more time in the office. For example, there are many food joints around the office, but most are choosing to do takeaway meals so they can lunch in the recreation room. \"I see more people staying back in the office to do non-work stuff, which is good, since we encourage bonding among staff,\" he says.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The new leaders really delivered and promised a number of concrete changes. China's reform boat has finally set sail,\" said Yao Wei, economist for Societe Generale.\n\nWhile restating it will increase the role of the market and pursue financial reform, the document fills many holes including that China will grant migrant workers more rights, abolish labour camps and modify it's very contested one-child policy - all issues which were omitted from the first draft.\n\nXi Jinping addressed many issues close to the heart of the Chinese including pollution, redistribution of wealth and corruption. \"To solve all these problems, the key issue is reform,\" he said. \"We absolutely must not waver\".\n\n\"This is the most impressive statement of reform intentions that we've seen this century. This document is clear, wide-ranging and does not shy away from areas of contention. This is the \"Master Plan\" that President Xi promised,\" commented Mark Williams, China economist with research firm Capital Economics.\n\nThe plan's first aim is to restructure and rebalance the economy to a more sustainable model by providing greater spending power to the population. Many imbalances are addressed such as the overpowering role of the state which will be cut back and that of state-owned enterprises (SOE), the main beneficiaries of growth so far, which will see more of their profits redistributed in the form of higher taxes.\n\nMigrants and farmers, most of whom have benefitted far less than the urban middle class from China's 30 years of double digit growth, will be granted more rights to unleash earnings and better redistribute GDP.\n\nMore specifically on the economic and financial front China will ease pricing regulations in transportation and telecommunications, water, oil, natural gas and electricity, all currently strictly controlled by the state.\n\nInvestments for private and foreign firms will be simplified, on a par with what is being tried out in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone. Private investors will be allowed to set up banks. Appraisal of local governments' performance will focus more on aspects other than GDP, such as pollution, excess capacity and debt. And fiscal spending will decouple from fiscal revenue or GDP. Furthermore China will allow private capital to take equity stakes in state-funded projects.\n\nThe plan adds that dividends paid by state-owned companies, which include some of China's largest firms, would increase to 30 per cent by 2020, from the current five per cent to 15 per cent.\n\nChina will also launch a series of experiments including putting together markets for farmers to swap land, further imposing property taxes, creating an intellectual-property court and expanding carbon-trading exchanges to more cities.\n\nThe document also points to reform of the judiciary currently intertwined with vested interests of local government officials, party members and businessmen. China will \"boost the judicial system to protect human rights\" the plan said and \"improve mechanisms to avoid false accusations and confessions obtained through torture\".\n\nThe country will abolish the re-education through labour system, will reduce the scope of the death penalty and reform its petitioning system.\n\nAnother breakthrough is the easing of the one-child policy in place since 1979. The number of couples allowed to have two children under the law will be expanded to include families where only one parent is an only child.\n\nPreviously the law granted this concession only to couples where both parents were the only children. This comes at a time when reports show that China's fertility rates are dropping, the population aging drastically, and point to a looming labour shortage in the coming years.\n\nAs a first and important step to reform China's household registration system, or hukou, which leaves millions of migrant workers unable to access public services in the cities, requirements for access to social welfare and affordable housing will be abolished in small cities and eased in medium-sized cities.\n\nNone of these reforms are particularly new and many such as reform of the household registration system have been in the works for years, endlessly delayed by internal politics in the rigid one-party system and by vested interests. But this is the first time specifics have been so clearly spelt out in a general plan offering a global vision for the country.\n\nPresident Xi who came into power exactly one year ago has been promoting the need for reform - stalled by the previous team - at home and overseas.\n\nAlong with Premier Li Keqiang the pair have been adamant about the need to change China's economic structure to better address the country's new challenges and imbalances inherited from a growth model mostly led by uncontrolled and often unproductive investments.\n\nAhead of the Plenum, President Xi had pledged a \"profound revolution\" raising expectations of how he would go about reforming the economy, the second largest in the world. Before him, former Premier Wen Jiabao also had the ambition to rebalance but reforms were on paper only.\n\nAlongside the plan published Friday, President Xi placed his name on a long document defending his reforms and explaining why China has to embark on a new journey. This is a sign analysts see as positive for implementation as the leaders' next challenge will be resistance from SOEs and local government which won't easily give up their privileges and abundant wealth.\n\nBut the document entitled \"Decisions of the Central Committee on Major Issues Concerning Comprehensively Deepening Reforms\" leaves little if no room for political change or questions the one-party rule. On the contrary, it reinforces the role of the Communist Party on the country and Xi Jinping as its leader.\n\nPart of the reform plan is the creation of an agency reporting directly to the president. And the document also clarifies that the national-security committee, announced on Tuesday, will largely focus on domestic issues, adding that a mechanism is needed so that \"contradictions can be defused\" referring to mounting signs of outspoken protest on the Internet and in the streets. President Xi's regime has intensified control on a much bigger scale than his predecessor, making dissenting voices all the harder to be heard.\n\nMany analysts question whether China can truly reform without the omniscient Party agreeing to let go of some power and granting citizens a bigger role in how they choose their leaders.\n\n\"Xi Jinping has really positioned himself as a political conservative and economic reformist,\" said one senior diplomat who has met with him several times.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

A face scanner may check your age and gender while sensors pick up your body heat to help locate popular parts of the store.\n\nConsumers have become used to players such as Amazon closely following their shopping habits online, triggering targeted product recommendations, advertising and offers. To counter the online threat, bricks and mortar retailers are playing catch-up, using increasingly sophisticated technology to improve staffing, layout and marketing.\n\nSome people are less comfortable being watched in the offline world, prompting many in the business to promise to use only anonymised and aggregated data unless shoppers explicitly give their permission to be tracked.\n\nBut as retailers get more sophisticated and link the data they collect to loyalty card schemes, shoppers are starting to sign up to schemes that follow their movements in return for targeted discounts and apps that help them find products.\n\nGerman fashion house Hugo Boss is using heat sensors to help place premium products. Luxury chocolate store Godiva has installed meters to count shoppers so it can match staffing to peak hours and measure the draw of window displays.\n\n\"Our customers are trying to run their stores or malls more efficiently,\" said Bill McCarthy, Europe and Middle East head of ShopperTrak, the US firm behind the Godiva counters. \"They are just trying to get real smart with data in the way the e-commerce guys are smart with data.\"\n\nThe Chicago-based company says its counters helped Godiva's store in London's Regent Street improve customer service and hone its window displays, boosting transactions by 10 per cent in six weeks.\n\nAs retailers seek ever more information, ShopperTrak has been investing in high-tech video and phone tracking systems to analyse how customers and staff behave inside a store.\n\n\"The information that we collect is strictly anonymous. We make extra efforts to ensure we keep nothing that is potentially personally identifiable,\" Mr McCarthy said.\n\nTesco, the world's third biggest retailer, drew criticism from British privacy groups earlier this month with plans to scan the faces of queuing customers to determine their gender and rough age to better target adverts.\n\nThe company, which put the tracking of customer behaviour on a whole new level with its Clubcard loyalty card two decades ago, said it would not record images or store personal data. Its advisers say some other retailers are less responsible.\n\n\"Too much is happening without consumer consent,\" said Simon Hay, chief executive of Dunnhumby, the customer science company owned by Tesco that is behind its loyalty scheme. \"You have to be transparent with data, tell people what you're doing with it and why and give them something in return.\"\n\nThat has long been the philosophy behind loyalty schemes, which are getting ever smarter as retailers link data from more sources. British shoppers now access an average of six loyalty schemes via their mobile devices compared to four in their wallets, a survey by mobile payments firm CloudZync showed.\n\nEven if a customer does not use their smartphone while in a store, retailers can deploy WiFi signals to track their location to within three metres, said Darren Vengroff, chief scientist at US data company RichRelevance. \"Every retailer wants to better understand their customer,\" said Mr Vengroff, previously the principal engineer at Amazon who helps clients such as Wal-Mart, Sears and Marks and Spencer provide more targeted offers to shoppers. \"The challenge is to make it really personal and not just a bunch of technology like 'Big Brother' watching you.\"\n\nLast month, a group of US companies specialising in location data for retailers agreed to a privacy code of conduct which includes signs posted in store to alert shoppers to the use of tracking technology and instructions for how to opt out.\n\nTelecoms group Telefonica dropped plans last year to sell location data it collects from its mobile phone customers to German retailers due to a backlash over privacy concerns. But it proceeded elsewhere, saying it gains insights only from aggregated data and does not sell personal information.\n\nTelefonica helped Britain's No 4 grocer Wm Morrison hone its marketing by using phone data to analyse how far potential shoppers would be prepared to travel to a store. That allowed it to target coupons to more households, driving a 150 per cent increase in new or reactivated customers.\n\nMany consumers are already shrugging off privacy concerns and embracing tracking technology: European retail consultancy Jupiter has seen a 90 per cent opt-in rate for a platform which offers marketing and mobile payments on smartphones.\n\n\"Messages are less and less likely to be annoying because they will become more and more targeted as you interact,\" said Robin Bevan, Javelin director of location and analytics. \"The system is self-learning: it tests the response rate to ensure that people don't get messages that aren't relevant.\"\n\nThe software is proving popular even in Germany, where data privacy is tightly controlled. Lufthansa has integrated it into its \"Miles & More\" loyalty app, signing up more than 400,000 users since its launch in 2010.\n\nOn Valentine's Day, the airline offered male app users aged 20-50 in Frankfurt airport a 20 per cent discount at jeweller Swarowski. It was redeemed by 30 per cent of those targeted, a much higher redemption rate than for normal promotions.\n\nSian Rowlands, an analyst at consultancy Juniper, sees the trend towards such promotions helping triple global spending on mobile advertising to US$39 billion in 2018 from US$13 billion now. \"At the moment, mobile users frequently see irrelevant adverts which are infringing on their mobile experience. Being able to target a user while they are out shopping versus at home has a greater impact.\"\n\nThe ability to track customers on their smartphones in the vicinity of a store should help \"bricks and mortar\" retailers fend off the online threat in other ways too, says Dan Wagner, head of e-commerce and mobile payment firm Powa Technologies. \"Geolocation is what is going to transform the leverage that a physical retailer has versus an online retailer. If I transmit my location to the retailer, they could say I have a store 300 metres away. You could drop by in half an hour and I'll have your goods for you. Amazon can't do that.\" Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

But a lot of people are now beginning to bet on London.\n\nOn Oct 29, the British government created a stir that reverberated across the financial capitals of the Islamic world. On that day, Prime Minister David Cameron announced that the UK Treasury would soon issue a \u00a3200 million (S$401 million) \"sukuk\" or Islamic bond. This will be the first sovereign sukuk issued by a Western country (a sukuk differs from a traditional bond in that it pays no interest; investors get a share of profits from an underlying syariah-compliant asset).\n\nMoreover, the UK sovereign sukuk could serve as a global benchmark for Islamic bonds, which at the moment have none.\n\nMr Cameron was speaking at the 9th World Islamic Economic Forum (WIEF) in London at the end of October - the first time this annual convention - known as \"the Davos of the Islamic world\" - has ever been held in a non-Islamic nation. He was expansive about his country's ambitions in the realm of syariah-compliant finance.\n\n\"London is already the biggest centre for Islamic finance outside the Islamic world,\" he said. \"I want London to stand alongside Dubai and Kuala Lumpur as one of the greatest capitals of Islamic finance anywhere in the world.\"\n\nThere's a lot to play for. According to a report by PwC, Islamic finance assets (including banking assets) total US$1.6 trillion globally. Between 2008 and 2012, they grew at close to 20 per cent per year and, by 2020, the market is expected to cross US$6 trillion. While Islamic finance assets are barely one per cent of all global financial assets, the number of players is also small.\n\nNearly all of the Western world does not participate in this market - London being the significant exception. Nine countries hold about 90 per cent of Islamic finance assets and just three (Iran, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia) account for more than 50 per cent.\n\nMoreover, in certain areas of Islamic finance, demand exceeds supply - and this is particularly true of bonds. Sukuks outstanding at the end of 2012 totalled US$240 billion, with Malaysia being the biggest issuer, followed by Saudi Arabia.\n\nLast year, Ernst & Young forecast that sukuk demand is likely to jump to US$900 billion by 2017, partly driven by rising risk aversion following the global financial crisis. Sukuks are popular because they are backed by real assets or real projects. Significantly, they are also favoured by investors from the non-Islamic world.\n\nAt the WIEF, Musaffar Hisham, CEO of Maybank Group Islamic Banking, pointed out that about half of the group's customers for Islamic products in Malaysia are non-Muslim. In Singapore, the figure is around 70 per cent.\n\nThe wider world's interest in Islamic finance products also derives from the growing interest in \"ethical finance\". During a session on Internationalising Islamic Finance at the WIEF, Hasan Al Jabri, CEO of Sedco Capital, an asset manager in Saudi Arabia, said: \"Syariah-compliant finance intersects 90 per cent with ethical finance, which is a US$6 trillion market.\"\n\nHe added that common features include investments in sustainable development and avoiding investments in companies associated with gambling, alcohol, tobacco and weapons. A growing number of pension funds - such as Calpers, the California public employees retirement system, the biggest in the United States - and several foundations have strict guidelines mandating that they invest ethically. Many have Islamic finance products in their portfolio.\n\nHowever, even its promoters and practitioners acknowledge that Islamic Finance has some way to go before it becomes truly mainstream. Sajid Javid, a British MP and Financial Secretary to the UK Treasury, who is one of the key personalities driving the development of Islamic finance in Britain pointed out: \"Islamic scholars don't always agree on what constitutes Islamic finance; they come from different schools of thought.\"\n\nAmr Al Menhali, head of Islamic Banking at the Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank in the UAE called for more simplicity in Islamic finance, including in the use of terminology.\n\nMaybank's Mr Hisham called for clearer global regulation to ensure more uniformity of syariah-compliant products.\n\nBut the UK is undeterred by these obstacles. It is pulling out all the stops to promote itself as the centre for Islamic finance. It has set up an Islamic Finance Task Force. Its infrastructure is already relatively advanced: more Islamic products are listed on London exchanges than anywhere else. London has 25 law firms that provide services in Islamic finance and more syariah-compliant banks than anywhere in the Western world. And 16 British universities offer courses in Islamic finance.\n\nEven London's mayor Boris Johnson (who spoke at the WIEF) is on board.\n\nThe mayor's office co-finances a corporation called London & Partners, which is the official promotional organisation for London, including for business, tourism, education, and conventions. Its director for International Business, David Slater told BT that London has seen what Islamic finance can do and likes what it sees.\n\nOn the proposed British sovereign sukuk, he said: \"Investors are demanding more Islamic finance products, so it's about following the market, responding to what the market wants.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

More broadly, it's a way of feeling the pulse of what's happening globally. Because Singapore is a key export base and hub, it gives us a sense of what's happening to the world's biggest economies.\n\n\"It also tends to correlate well with some of the services components in Singapore's GDP. Although these are re-exports, and there's not much value added in terms of the production cycle, there is value added in terms of the trade-related services that Singapore provides.\"\n\nWith the wholesale trade and transport and storage segments making up approximately 20 per cent of the Republic's GDP, economists say NORX's cheery showing in October - due to an increase in both electronic and non-electronic NORX - augurs well for Q4 growth numbers.\n\nUOB economist Francis Tan pointed out: \"This is also consistent with the monthly growth rates in the sea-cargo handled statistics provided by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, where it showed a 3.2 per cent year-on-year growth year-to-date.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Barclays economist Joey Chew highlighted the \"diverging fortunes\" of Singapore's non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and NORX, which in part reflects the rising services output from the manufacturing sectors, due to structural changes in the economy.\n\nSaid Ms Chew: \"NORX rose 26.7 per cent year-on-year and (10.3 per cent on a month-on-month seasonally adjusted basis) to a record high; in contrast, NODX remains some 10 per cent lower than its historical high in early 2012. Although NODX and NORX used to trend together, reflecting common global and regional drivers of demand, we think the recent divergence reflects (two things).\n\n\"One, (it shows) Singapore's growth underperformance relative to global and regional trends due to domestic drags from restructuring; and two, (it reflects) Singapore's increasing ties with the regional economies via services, rather than traditional manufacturing supply chains,\" said Ms Chew.\n\nShe added that while some types of mass production may no longer be economically viable in Singapore, the provision of supply chain logistics solutions and port services continues to be relevant.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's very clear that there has been a turnaround. The worst is over,\" states CEO Patrick Chew unequivocally in an interview with The Business Times last Friday, a day after the company - which makes aluminium parts for trains - reported that it swung to a net profit of 16.4 million yuan (S$3.4 million) from a net loss of 6.1 million yuan a year ago.\n\n\"The last few quarters of negative cash flow have now turned positive. The environment is clearly improving, and when the tender for high-speed trains was announced in August, we got it very fast, by October.\n\n\"Gross profit margins, that have come down to 21 per cent, should be at a floor and will creep back as we shift our product mix back to more transport.\"\n\nThe lucrative high-margin contracts for making aluminium bodies for high-speed train cars might be starting to roll in again, two years after the deadly 2011 Wenzhou high-speed train crash threw the train industry into a slump and along with it, Midas's fortunes. Compared to 2011, Midas's 2012 revenues fell by a fifth to 870 million yuan, while net profit had dived 85 per cent to 28 million yuan.\n\nBut even as its China order book is perking up, Midas is looking beyond grubbing from the same pot of gold.\n\nIt is expanding its core business of making aluminium components for train cars beyond China into Europe, and even won a contract to make Singapore MRT car bodies earlier this year. It is innovating by prefabricating ready-made parts for companies instead of just supplying the aluminium profiles for them to shape.\n\nThe company is also collaborating with local universities to do research and development work into new aluminium-related products for use in another industry altogether. Mr Chew, however, declined to divulge further details.\n\nA new plant that manufactures aluminium plates and sheets to supply other transport industries such as automobiles or aviation is also being built and will be ready by 2015.\n\n\"In those days, from 2007 to 2009, everything was booming. It was only in 2011 that things started unravelling. We know now that we cannot be too single-sector focused,\" Mr Chew says.\n\n\"We are diversifying our product offerings, mitigating our risks. Who knows if sometimes things happen again and set you back by another two years.\"\n\nFor its third quarter results ended Sept 30, Midas also reported that revenue increased by 48.5 per cent from 203 million yuan a year ago to 301 million yuan. In a report last Thursday, CIMB Research also noted, in a report, the improvement of some financial metrics.\n\nDays of sales outstanding - a measure of how long a company takes to collect revenue after a sale is made, the lower the better - have come down from a peak of almost 500 days in the first quarter of the year to just under 400 days in the third quarter.\n\nDays of inventory outstanding, or how long a company holds its finished goods before selling it - again, the lower the better - have come down from over 350 days in the first quarter to just over 200 days in the third quarter.\n\nWhile Midas has announced a stream of contract wins in the past year for slower metro train cars, the moment the market was waiting for came on Oct 21, when the company announced it had won high-speed train contracts worth 167.5 million yuan by subsidiaries of state-owned enterprise China CNR Corporation, which manufactures trains for the domestic market.\n\nThe contract was a harbinger of what could come. Midas shares, which had been trading at around 45 cents, shot up to around 50 cents. Maybank Kim Eng Research had said in September that it estimates Midas to snag around 1 billion yuan of contract wins each year in 2014 and 2015 in the high-speed sector alone.\n\n\"Now there's a second round of tenders for (more) train sets than the first round. We expect the results to be known before mid-December,\" Mr Chew says. \"We have a very good relationship with all the major train makers as we have been supplying them since 2002 or 2003, and participated in most of their projects in China.\" The two main state-owned enterprises that make trains are China CNR and China CSR, and Midas gets contracts from their subsidiaries.\n\nThe Chinese central government is committed to driving a recovery in railway infrastructure spending, Mr Chew notes. The China Railway Corporation, China's national railway operator, had announced raising its annual investments in fixed assets to 660 billion yuan in 2013.\n\nMidas's slice of the pie goes something like this. Out of the total amount of committed infrastructure spending, 20 per cent is on train equipment. The niche area of aluminium parts Midas makes accounts for 2 to 3 per cent of that. And in China, Mr Chew estimates that Midas has a 60 per cent market share of the train aluminium profiles business. \"We were a very early player, the second company in China that started manufacturing all this in 2002. We built our market share over the years,\" he says.\n\nOn competition, he says: \"The number of industry players have since grown to around 12, versus five when we first started. But only five or six now have the track record and quality to supply train companies.\"\n\nBorn in 1962 to a fisherman father and housewife mother, Mr Chew was the second youngest sibling in a large family of 10. He left school after his A Levels in 1980 and was involved in various businesses, including prawn farming, shipping and a timber business in China.\n\n\"I may not have excelled academically, but I have an urge to do well in life. Coming from a poor background, it's all about hunger. It drives you. You must do something, work for it and lead a better life,\" he says.\n\nIt was during his days in the timber business in China 20 years ago that he noticed how vital transportation is - when he had difficulty getting the timber cargo out of forested areas.\n\nHe set up Midas in 2000 with a partner, and the company was listed in Singapore in 2004.\n\nSays Mr Chew: \"When we stumbled upon this (aluminium) business, we saw the potential for China. Rail is still the most economical form of transport. Aluminium is three times lighter than steel, which was used for trains then ... as a businessman, you have to see the trend.\"\n\n\"There are always risks associated with the material aluminium,\" he continues. \"But in the near future, even if (China) does away with aluminium, we can still use our capacity for other industries and go into lower margin products.\n\n\"For now, we will make as much as possible, and strike while the iron is hot.\"\n\nThis column is an expanded version of CEO Speaks, where views are curated from a wider range of corporate leaders to better capture all that's going on in the business world\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For instance, firms can now shorten bandwidth provisioning time to minutes, compared to 15-20 days required by conventional network approaches.\n\nUsers can also order network capacity by the hour instead of being locked into a contract for a particular quality of connection for a year.\n\nPacnet believes that this network-as-a-service offering which allows commercial usage by the hour is the first to be available in the region.\n\n\"Today, rigid commercial network practices remain one of the biggest obstacles when it comes to tapping the full benefits of cloud computing,\" said Jim Fagan, Pacnet's president of managed services. \"You can turn up 1,000 servers on a cloud provider's platform in minutes, but connecting those servers in a reliable, secure and scalable fashion on an enterprise-class platform could still take months.\n\n\"Probably the most disruptive attribute of cloud computing is that you can turn off those 1,000 servers as quickly as you've turned them on. On the network side you can't just give the connection back - you are either stuck paying for the network connection in a prolonged contract, or have to pay a hefty early termination fine,\" he added.\n\nIt is not just the online flash sales portals and content providers which require support for temporary or seasonal spikes in traffic that will find such a service useful.\n\nIn terms of disaster recovery, companies no longer have to be weighed down by heavy network costs since they can go for bandwidth on demand.\n\nAlso, users can now segregate traffic flows for different applications and determine different levels of the quality of service accordingly. So low-latency connections can be sourced for critical applications, and best-effort delivery opted for non-critical applications to minimise costs.\n\nUsing PEN has given one of Pacnet's customers a whole new level of diagnostics too, as the separate traffic flows allow it to monitor and fine-tune each application as needed, said Mr Fagan.\n\nThis network is enabled by software-defined networking (SDN), where control of the network is de-coupled from the physical hardware and instead managed by a software controller. With this software layer, network administrators can better manage the network and its performance without having to physically access network devices, thus gaining flexibility and efficiency.\n\nCurrently available in 10 of Pacnet's data centres in Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Sydney and Melbourne, PEN will be officially launched next February.\n\nDepending on customer demand, Pacnet may expand this offering throughout its global network of data centres, said Mr Fagan.\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, it operates 18 data centres that are all interconnected by its high-speed network.\n\nPEN offers customers access to major multiple or large carriers and data centres through the Pacnet network, and creates a virtualised cross-connected environment. This means that customers can provision a network from Pacnet's Singapore data centre to their on-premise facilities in Australia, said Mr Fagan.\n\nSince undergoing a business revamp last year that saw it shed its residential Internet service and wholesale voice businesses, Pacnet has put a lot of focus into building up its managed services arm. It is investing US$100 million annually in upgrading and expanding its data centre footprint this year and next.\n\nEarlier this year, it expanded its facilities in Singapore and Sydney as well as launched a new one in Chongqing, China. Another facility is expected to be completed in Tianjin next year. These will not only support its new initiative but also meet the growing need for data centre services in the region.\n\nWith PEN, Pacnet hopes to accelerate its data centre business growth. The company's data centre business currently contributes to less than 20 per cent of its total revenue, and it aims to raise this to 50 per cent in the next three to five years, said Mr Fagan.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Apple's iOS operating system came in a distant second with a 12.9 per cent market share, according to results released by IDC.\n\nDespite the high base effect, the Android OS has increased its market share from the 74.9 per cent in the year-ago quarter. In total, 211.6 million devices running on the Android OS were sold in the third quarter of this year, up 51.3 per cent from the year-ago period figure of 139.9 million, the IDC study shows.\n\nApple also saw an increase in device sales with an increase of 25.6 per cent year on year from 26.9 million to 33.8 million during the third quarter. In an apparent indication that Microsoft may have got its mobile device strategy in order with its latest mobile OS, Windows devices saw an impressive 156 per cent increase in sales to 9.5 million units from the 3.7 million sold last year during the quarter. Not surprisingly, BlackBerry was a big loser with its share going down 41.6 per cent to 4.5 million units from the 7.7 million it sold in the third quarter of last year.\n\n\"Android and Windows Phone continued to make significant strides in the third quarter. Despite their differences in market share, they both have one important factor behind their success: price,\" said Ramon Llamas, research manager with IDC's mobile phone team. \"Both platforms have a selection of devices available at prices low enough to be affordable to the mass market, and it is the mass market that is driving the entire market forward.\"\n\nSmartphone average selling prices (ASPs) have continued to decline as the appetite for more affordable devices grows, according to IDC. ASPs were down 12.5 per cent in the third quarter, accounting for an average price of US$317. At the same time, the market has seen a large influx of large-screen smartphones (5-7 inch screens), also known as phablets.\n\nThese generally come with a higher selling price than smaller screen devices, due to the need for more powerful and expensive components. Phablet ASPs in the third quarter were notably higher than the market average at US$443. However, the third quarter ASP was down 22.8 per cent from US$573 in the third quarter.\n\nIn its research report on the mobile phone market, Gartner said worldwide mobile phone sales to end users totalled 455.6 million units in the third quarter, an increase of 5.7 per cent from the same period last year. Sales of smartphones accounted for 55 per cent of overall mobile phone sales during the quarter and reached their highest share to date.\n\nWorldwide smartphone sales reached 250.2 million units, up 45.8 per cent from the third quarter of 2012, it said. (IDC puts this estimate at 261.1 million, up 39.9 per cent). Asia Pacific led the growth in both markets - the smartphone segment with 77.3 per cent increase and the mobile phone segment with 11.9 per cent growth. The other regions to show a rise in the overall mobile phone market were Western Europe, which returned to growth for the first time this year, and the Americas.\n\nAmong the device makers, Samsung sold 80.3 million units in the third quarter with a 32.1 per cent market share, compared to 30.3 million units sold by Apple for a 12.1 per cent market share. While Samsung's share of the growing market remains the same as it was a year ago, Apple's share declined to 12.1 per cent from 14.3 per cent in the third quarter of 2012. In terms of number of units shipped, Samsung and Apple were the top two, followed by Lenovo, with 5.1 per cent market share and LG Electronics with a 4.8 per cent share.\n\nIn overall mobile phone sales, Samsung again came on top with 117 million units sold with a market share of 25.7 per cent. Nokia, with its strong line-up of feature phones, came in second with 63 million phones, taking a 13.8 per cent market share. Despite only selling high-end smartphone, Apple came in third with a 6.7 per cent market share.\n\nWhile Samsung has started to address its user experience, better design is another area where Samsung needs to focus, said Anshul Gupta, principal research analyst at Gartner. \"Samsung's recent joint venture with carbon fibre company SGL Group could bring improvements in this area in future products,\" he added.\n\nTalking about Apple, he said Gartner believes the price difference between the iPhone 5c and 5s is not enough in mature markets, where prices are skewed by operator subsidies, to drive users away from the top of the line model (5s). In emerging markets, the iPhone 4S will continue to be the volume driver at the low end as the lack of subsidy in most markets leaves the iPhone 5c too highly priced to help drive further penetration.\n\n\"Sales of feature phones continued to decline and the decrease was more pronounced in markets where the ASP for feature phones was much closer to the ASP affordable smartphones,\" Mr Gupta added. \"In markets such as China and Latin America, demand for feature phones fell significantly as users rushed to replace their old models with smartphones.\"\n\nGartner analysts said global mobile phone sales are on pace to reach 1.81 billion units in 2013, a 3.4 per cent increase from 2012. \"We will see several new tablets enter the market for the holiday season, and we expect consumers in mature markets will favour the purchase of smaller-sized tablets over the replacement of their older smartphones\" said Mr Gupta.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

If that were not enough for the stock bulls, Ms Yellen dismissed the notion that the run-up in stocks constituted a bubble.\n\nEven as Ms Yellen insisted that the Fed had nothing to do with the stock market, her testimony echoed statements from central banks and governments worldwide. All share the sense that the only way out of a five-year stagnation of growth is to stimulate private investment by keeping interest rates at record lows.\n\nLast week, a top official at the European Central Bank said that the central bank would keep every option on the table to fight the onset of deflation. A high-ranking Japanese official said that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government would intervene in currency markets if necessary to prevent yen appreciation from hurting the export-oriented economy.\n\nThe power of central banks to drive up stock prices is evident when you consider that the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the week within 40 points of 16,000 - more than twice its 2009 low and up nearly 25 per cent for the year to date - even as jobs, industrial-production and earnings data broadly disappointed last week.\n\n\"In the broad Standard & Poor's 500, there have been 83 negative (earnings) pre-announcements issued by corporations for the fourth quarter compared to nine positive (earnings) pre-announcements,\" said analysts at Thomson Reuters, in a research note.\n\n\"By dividing 83 by nine, one arrives at a Negative/Positive ratio of 9.2 for the S&P 500 Index. If this persists, it will be the most negative N/P ratio on record.\"\n\nEffectively, investors have decided to hold their noses and buy stocks. After all, the economic and corporate outlook simply does not justify the recent torrid stock gains. As illustrated by the Thomson Reuters data, the outlook for corporate profits has, if anything, worsened.\n\nAnd economic data is, at best, ambiguous, and, to some prognosticators, ominous. Europe and the US are dangerously close to the position Japan found itself in after its financial crisis in the early 1990s. Japan's recovery was similarly slow. After several years waiting for wages to increase, many Japanese people settled for part-time work. Consumer spending declined, and the economy atrophied for a decade.\n\nIn the eurozone last month, consumer prices rose just 0.7 per cent from a month earlier, and were down 1.1 per cent from a year earlier. Screening out the effects of volatile energy prices, many European countries have seen consumer prices decline recently.\n\n\"I think deflation is a much bigger concern for central banks around the world including the US,\" than the danger of asset bubbles,\" said Oliver Pursche, president of money manager Gary Goldberg Financial Services.\n\n\"You can argue that we've been in somewhat of a deflationary cycle or certainly in no inflation,\" Mr Pursche said. Petrol and cotton and produce are not costing more today than they did a year ago and that's a plus. (But), we've had no real wage growth in Europe, Asia or the US in quite some time. That's what central banks are worried about . . . they're worried that people's purchasing power is in fact declining.\"\n\nIn the US, wages are stagnant largely because there are very few new jobs available. As long as people feel it's difficult to find another job, employers do not have to boost salaries to hang onto workers. Mr Pursche estimates this will remain the case for another five years.\n\nLast week, October industrial data reflected a drag from the slowdown in government orders related, and this week's retail sales data could show the effects of furloughed government workers.\n\n\"Obviously, the government shutdown had an impact on sales - the question is by how much,\" said Quincy Krosby, investment strategist at Prudential Financial.\n\nStock bulls argue that the fourth quarter will mark the nadir of the current global economic cycle. By this reading, there was a burst of activity between 2009 and 2011, in the immediate aftermath of the recession, as retailers and wholesalers were forced to replenish empty shelves. When the \"restocking\" finished, governments worldwide have cut their spending, causing another dip in demand for steel makers and heavy manufacturers such as Caterpillar ran out of steam in the last couple of years as government spending retrenched. Now, the restocking is supposed to start again, and another couple of lean years will be followed by some fat.\n\n\"US global profits are poised to expand over the near term as global growth rebounds in the developed and developing nations,\" said Joe Quinlan, market strategist at Bank of America Private Wealth Management.\n\nLong-term, the bull market depends on this rebound materialising. But the upward momentum could be enough to keep it going in the short term.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This translates to an effective annual rate of 9.68 per cent.\n\nA three-month loan will have a flat interest rate of 1.75 per cent, or an effective annual rate of 7.12 per cent. And the six-monthly flat rate is 2.5 per cent, or an effective annual rate of 5.13 per cent.\n\nThis compares to interest rates of 20 per cent a year at pawnshops, which target similar clientele.\n\n\"This promotion is aimed at blue-collar workers who might need bridging funds for a short holiday or to buy some things urgently,\" head of marketing services Yet Pek Yeen told The Business Times.\n\nApplicants typically take out a loan for three months amounting to around $10,000, a Hong Leong Finance spokesman added.\n\nThe Express Share Loan promotion has been around since the 1990s, but it does not run every year. This current promotion is running from Nov 15, 2013, to Feb 15, 2014. The loan amount is up to 70 per cent of the market share price or Hong Leong Finance's own cap, whichever is lower.\n\nThe market for short-term finance has been booming in Singapore. The amount of loans given out by pawnshops jumped from $4.9 billion in 2011 to $7.1 billion last year.\n\nThree pawnshops have listed on the Singapore Exchange since 2012 - Maxi-Cash, MoneyMax and ValueMax.\n\nHong Leong Finance closed unchanged at $2.69 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is a far cry from the company's previous office, which was bigger, but had the typical cubicle-and-partitioned wall combination.\n\nWarner Music Singapore's general manager Simon Nasser says, \"the office now has a more homely feel\".\n\nHe would know. Mr Nasser worked with interior design firm Forward 50 on the new look, without revealing anything to his staff in Singapore or to his superiors in Hong Kong. \"Everyone had a pleasant surprise when we moved in four months ago,\" says Mr Nasser. The office has a chic industrial look - think cement and brick walls, mixed with steel and wood. \"I was confident that people would like it, since this is similar to my home. And they all love coming over to my place,\" quips Mr Nasser.\n\nThe office was also shortlisted this year for the Herman Miller Most Liveable Office Award.\n\nForward 50 director Christopher Kwek had a clear idea of how he wanted the office to be. \"Since this is the office for a music company, it would have been easy to put music symbols around the space. But that is so cliched and overdone,\" he says.\n\nInstead, he focused on using materials to bring life to the space. Cement flooring and walls all around give the office a raw feel. To add interest to the reception area, Mr Kwek created a feature wall out of recycled railway sleepers, that is adjacent to a brick wall. The breakout area by the reception, with its mix of mid-century furniture pieces and a hanging, bespoke TV console that resembles a fireplace, could easily be mistaken for a living room rather than a space for discussions. It also doesn't help that the pantry area, with a bright orange Smeg fridge, is next to it.\n\nThe initial idea was for the office to not have any rooms, but Mr Kwek advised otherwise. \"This was the first time that I had to suggest the need for rooms,\" he says. There are only two here - a glass-enclosed one for Mr Nasser, and the second which is the meeting room.\n\nMr Kwek did away with the typical conference table, and had a table made of African mahogany in its place. \"It is narrower than the usual width, so everyone can get closer in a meeting,\" he says.\n\nMr Nasser chose pieces for his office, such as a stainless steel beaded curtain, which he bought from the now-defunct Ink Bar.\n\nThe remaining staff sit in an open area, with workstations arranged in a boomerang configuration, \"to encourage more mingling\", says Mr Kwek.\n\nWhereas the old office used to have storage for CDs, visitors would be hard-pressed to find a single CD in this office. \"We have gone totally digital,\" says Mr Nasser. Music is now stored in a computer, and every day, each staff member gets to play music from their personal playlist. \"We all have different tastes in music, but so far, we have not had any problems,\" he says.\n\nThe industrial chic look is going so well with the management office in Hong Kong that Mr Nasser's boss wants to recreate this look for its other offices in the Philippines and Malaysia. There will be competition to see who has the best office. Mr Nasser is unfazed. \"I say bring it on.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Observers say demolition responsibility belongs to the shipbuilding countries.\n\nIn Kesennuma - where the 330-ton, 60m long Kyotoku Maru No 18 was washed ashore by tsunami following the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake - heavy machines roared as they carried steel plates cut from the fishing vessel. Although plans to preserve the ship as a reminder of the disaster were once discussed, work to dismantle the ship was completed on Oct 28.\n\nDemolition work was contracted to Ship Recycle Muroran, a non-profit organisation based in Muroran, Hokkaido. Steel parts taken from Kyotoku Maru No 18 will become car parts, manholes and other useful items. The ship's screw was also sold. Most of the ship's parts have been recycled.\n\nDemolition work was conducted in a way that prevents toxic substances, such as asbestos, from spreading to the environment, and unclean water created during the work was purified before being released into the ocean.\n\nShip Recycle Muroran is also working on improving water jet technology to cut steel plates. The technology can prevent heavy fuel oil and chemical substances in ships from catching fire because pressurised water is used in dismantling ships.\n\nAs of 2012, 94 per cent of the world's ship demolition was carried out by four countries - India, Bangladesh, China and Pakistan - because of low labour costs and strong demand for iron in these nations.\n\nAlthough Japan is a leading shipbuilding and maritime country, which builds 18 per cent of the world's ships and owned 14 per cent of ships in terms of tonnage as of the end of 2012, ship demolition has decreased in this country after peaking in 1985.\n\nExcept for vessels belonging to the Self-Defense Forces and Japan Coast Guard, hardly any ships are scrapped here.\n\nThe move is spreading into other areas in Japan. In April, The Ehime Toyo Shippu Risaikuru Kenkyukai, a ship recycling study group based in Niihama, Ehime Prefecture, completed scrapping the Yotei Maru, a 8,310-ton former ferryboat that plied the Tsugaru Strait between Aomori and Hakodate, Hokkaido, in cooperation with a ship demolition firm in Kagawa Prefecture. The aim of the project was to improve ship-scrapping techniques. Study groups were launched in other areas, including Nakatsu, Oita Prefecture.\n\nThe main problem is the cost for dismantling ships. In scrapping Kesennuma's Kyotoku Maru No 18, only 10 people were engaged in the demolition work and the time they were allowed was shortened to six weeks. Even so, they only managed to cover about 50 million yen (S$620,000) out of the total cost for scrapping the ship through insurance taken out by the ship's owner and the sale of iron and other materials from the ship. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Simple APs commonly found in these set-ups lack reliability and robust performance, which then makes the simple task of loading a Web page or downloading documents a time-consuming chore for employees, he noted.\n\nOn the other hand, implementing a full-featured Wi-Fi controller to provide the security, management and access policies in these branches would be costly and most of the features unnecessary for such a small setting, Mr Tay added.\n\nThis is the market segment the networking vendor was targeting when it announced its Aruba Central cloud-based management service in October. Within Asia-Pacific, the executive noted the opportunities would likely lie with big retail brands, food and beverage outlets, and the education sector, particularly among pre-school centres.\n\nFor instance, there are 11,000 pre-school centres in Thailand alone, which illustrates the ample market space for Aruba to carve a niche for itself and promote its Wi-Fi management service, he said. The ease of deploying its Instant brand APs, which come pre-configured according to the management and access policies set on Aruba Central, is a key differentiator for the vendor. The other is offering companies' IT teams the ability to monitor and manage the performance of the APs with one log-in process rather than having to log in multiple times for the individual branches, he elaborated.\n\nThe main customers for Aruba Central are from the United States and these are multinational retail companies and coffee-shop chains. Given their global nature, however, some of their satellite branches in Asia would also be equipped with Aruba's Instant APs, Mr Tay said.\n\nHe added that in Asia-Pacific itself, there would be a big launch event in Macau during the coming week to showcase the product and educate the wider business audience about its potential benefits.\n\nAsked what kind of market value Aruba sees in this part of the region, he said \"it is going to be big\". He added: \"We wouldn't have spent so much time and engineering resources to build Aruba Central from the ground up if we did not think there is a big opportunity going forward.\"\n\nAccording to Dell'Oro Group, the annual Wi-Fi market is valued at US$4 billion and the cloud Wi-Fi segment constitutes about 5 per cent. However, Mr Tay believes this will grow to 35 per cent going forward. As for market competition, particularly from Cisco Systems and its Meraki brand cloud Wi-Fi tools, Aruba is in a good position because of the \"seamless integration\" between its APs and the central management platform, he said.\n\nThis is because while Meraki is aimed at small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) because of its \"cheap and simple\" AP devices, it remains incompatible with Cisco's other Wi-Fi management platform Aironet, which provides control over a wider, campus-level WAN (wide area network).\n\nSo in the case of a fast-expanding SME, for example, they would have to replace their Meraki APs to Aironet-based ones as they scale up. Even if they do not, the organisation would face roaming management challenges given that different branches are on different APs, he stated.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We will do this by engaging the country (and help in its reconstruction).\"\n\nIt's a more useful and tried stand that goes well with Singapore's belief not to meddle in the domestic affairs of others, he said. \"We hope that this would promote the recovery and reconciliation,\" said Mr Lee, who is now back in Singapore. \"But really, you cannot impose reconciliation from the outside, nor is it our business to intervene in other country's affairs.\"\n\nAsean, of which Singapore is a member, seems to have succeeded in persuading Myanmar to introduce democracy and open the country to investors with constructive engagement. And Singapore companies are among those rushing in to do business.\n\nWill Singapore back Singapore companies to invest in Sri Lanka as well? Mr Lee said the government will encourage them to invest in \"the region\" but won't tell them where exactly to put their money. \"Whether they come to Sri Lanka or (go) elsewhere, it's up to them. It's their decision.\"\n\nInvestment is different from constructive engagement, he said. \"It's a matter of security environment, business environment, political outlook and basically a decision of the company - whether the timing is right, favourable for investments, what opportunities are here, elsewhere, whether they want to put their money and bet and go for it.\"\n\nSri Lanka has a population of 20 million and an estimated per capita income of US$3,200 in 2012. The economy has expanded by up to 8.2 per cent yearly since the end of the civil war in 2009. Tourism is a main sector of the economy and a record one million tourists visited the country last year. The other key sectors are tea, agriculture and apparel and textile.\n\nWith the country now stable and at peace, the Sri Lankan government has set ambitious targets to develop economic hubs in ports, aviation, commerce, knowledge and energy.\n\nA United States Department of State report says that apart from tourism and ports, there's also ample scope for foreign investments in information technology, business processing, franchising, retail and services as well as light manufacturing.\n\nBut it cautions that doing business in Sri Lanka can also be challenging, with \"high transaction costs related to an unpredictable economic policy environment\".\n\nMr Lee noted that there are Singapore companies in Sri Lanka - and some have been there for many years. \"Some are doing OK, some have various issues which they are sorting out,\" he said. \"It's a situation which is developing, the government is working very hard to bring in investments and develop the confidence and momentum. I am sure our businesses are watching it closely.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The office tower has been fully leased, and the mall is over 90 per cent leased. RevPar and occupancy rates for the hotels were not disclosed, but Mr Teo said occupancies were \"steady\".\n\nHiap Hoe has plans to replicate the integrated development concept overseas, having acquired three sites in Melbourne, Australia, in the past few months. There are opportunities for hotels at all three plots.\n\n\"As you are aware, the Singapore market is now getting very tough, margins (have) become very thin,\" Mr Teo said, explaining the expansion overseas.\n\nThe company is also looking at areas such as London, and for opportunities in the United States and New Zealand, he said.\n\nBut that does not mean that it is giving up on the Singapore market.\n\nAssuming the price is right, Mr Teo said that \"we will still continue in Singapore and develop more properties, depending on the timing and what kind of opportunities we have here\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's not the fanciest of locations with its mish-mash of learning centres, supermarket and mid to low-end eateries.\n\nBut, at least, Home is on the slightly better end with an Italian deli and bakery as neighbours, although it still sits a little conspicuously with its posher decor that hints at Chef Tan's fine-dining chops.\n\nSo while you do get city restaurant quality, it's at pretty wallet-friendly prices. Where else can you get half a Peking duck for $38 - perfect for smaller groups who want variety instead of being force-fed a whole bird with little stomach room for much else?\n\nChef Tan's lychee wood-smoked duck yields scant slivers of paper-thin skin that you dip in pink sugar, followed by a larger portion of sliced meat and skin to be savoured the traditional way with steamed, almost chewy pancakes.\n\nYou need to eat the meat really fast because the chef deliberately drains the fat so the duck is leaner - and thus gets dry and chewy within minutes of cooling. The duck course doesn't end there, though. For an extra $10, you'll get the remaining meaty bones in your choice of soup or stir-fried in ginger and green onion.\n\nWhile the duck is adequate - the chef's roasting skills come into force with his crisp crackling roast pork belly ($16) - equal layers of juicy meat and decadent fat topped with a thin layer of crunchy skin without any excess salt. The char siew is good too - juicy slabs of pork loin ($14) which have the bounce and bite of pork collar. Makes you wish he could serve dim sum as well, though, but he doesn't.\n\nInstead, he's got heftier tricks up his sleeve such as marble goby ($9 per 100gm) which doesn't get the familiar treatment of being steamed or deep-fried. Instead, the whole fish is cooked in a claypot so you can enjoy the smooth texture of well-steamed fish with the bonus of a fragrant but slightly oily broth scented with Chinese wine, lemongrass and galangal.\n\nHe also makes his own tofu ($18) - eggy and fluffy with bits of prawn and crab roe in an enriched yellow gravy that can be quite heavy-going. Same with the braised vermicelli with braised pork knuckle ($20) - unfortunately bland with few slivers of meat.\n\nThe main grouse about chef Tan's cooking is that while it's generally tasty, the food sits heavily in the stomach.\n\nDon't expect light, delicate flavours or super-refined cuisine. This is rich, robust comfort food for hearty appetites - so if a slap-up meal is the goal, then chef Tan is your new best friend who would like to take you Home with him.\n\nRating:\n\n7\n\njaime@sph.com.sg\n\nWHAT OUR RATINGS MEAN\n\n10: The ultimate dining experience\n\n9-9.5: Sublime\n\n8-8.5: Excellent\n\n7-7.5: Good to very good\n\n6-6.5: Promising\n\n5-5.5: Average\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

When he says \"dance\", they dance. And when he turns around (metaphorically, of course) to the audience and says \"laugh\", there is no way you can resist his command.\n\nSuch is the skill of Japanese director Yukio Ninagawa, who can tug at your heartstrings one moment and have you doubled-over in laughter the next.\n\nIt's no wonder he has been billed as one of the Three Titans of Theatre and tickets to his staging of Hisashi Inoue's Musashi at the Esplanade Theatre last weekend sold out in no time.\n\nThe story kicks off in the year 1612 with a battle between two rival samurais that ends with Musashi Miyamoto (Tatsuya Fujiwara) sparing the life of the younger Kojiro Sasaki (Junpei Mizobata) after the latter's defeat.\n\nSix years later, Musashi is at a retreat at a Buddhist temple when a revenge-seeking Kojiro makes an appearance and challenges him to another duel.\n\nMusashi accepts the challenge and they decide to fight in three days, much to the chagrin of the monk Soho Takuan (Naomasa Musaka).\n\nThe retreat's inhabitants including the monk, his abbot Heishin (Keita Oishi), shogun advisor Munenori Yagyu (Kohtaloh Yoshida), and two female temple patrons Mai Kiya (Kayoko Shiraishi) and Otome Fudeya (Anne Suzuki) launch into various schemes to persuade the two samurais to give up their rivalry.\n\nFor a moment then, it threatened to get monotonous as they deliver parables and sermons along the lines of \"people make the chain (of revenge) so they can also break it\".\n\nBut this was peppered with enough mischief, humour and timely quips like \"listen to old people, they're closer to heaven\" to keep audience entertained.\n\nNoh-enthusiast Munenori also kept stealing the scene with his whimsical, unexpected outbursts into the Japanese musical performing art.\n\nSo much so for the revered image of samurais, which popular culture often portray as masculine and dignified. In the world of Musashi, these proud Japanese warriors are made to look a little goofy too, as when they had to perform a hilarious Hollywood-style training montage.\n\nThere's a breezy, irreverent quality to the storytelling that both parodies the samurai stereotype and pays homage to its sacred traditions.\n\nAs with all Ninagawa productions, the beautiful set design is a thing of constant marvel with trees that seemed to sway and shiver along with the action on stage. Set designer Tsukasa Nakagoshi deserves his own applause.\n\nThe previous fondly-remembered Ninagawa production of Macbeth in 1992 showed the director's unadulterated dramatic side. Musashi showed Ninagawa's playful side as he turns what was potentially a reverent affair into a rollicking ride.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Cheah Ui-Hoon\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 15, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWHEN your family once owned sprawling tea plantations and have the knowledge and capability in manufacturing tea, then reading the tea leaves at the bottom of the tea cup is easy.\n\nThe dregs can only read \"Build a tea brand\" - which is what Singapore's BP de Silva Group's fifth-generation scion Rehan Amarasuriya, 27, was tasked with and set out to do. With the explosion of interest in branded and designer coffees in the last couple of years, he sees Singapore consumers wanting more quality in their teas as well.\n\nBP de Silva Group's 1872 Clipper Tea was launched earlier this year, pitched at a cut above supermarket grades. The brand has been making an impact in boutique settings such as PasarBella and Tangs' recently revamped basement store.\n\n\"The idea of 1872 Clipper Tea is to elevate the tea experience beyond a simple beverage and make it a simple daily luxury since tea is something accessible to everyone. We take the best of each tea-growing region - Ceylon, India and Taiwan,\" he adds.\n\n\"The whole idea is to close the gap between buying tea based on sight and smell - and tasting,\" Rehan says of 1872 Clipper Tea's comprehensive clipper-themed booth, which also offers tea sampling and tea gifts.\n\n\"From what we've noticed, customers want something they can experience while we want to educate them about tea. Consumers should be able to taste the teas they buy, at the retail level,\" he adds.\n\nThe current trend points to flavoured teas as well as herbal, non-caffeinated teas. \"People are beginning to take to infusions. And then there are specialist teas we carry, such as Oolong from Alishan, recommended by a staff member who discovered it while on holiday in Taiwan. The estate sent us their first flush and we've been buying from them ever since,\" says Mr Amarasuriya.\n\nThe label has some 40 different types of tea at the moment, but Mr Amarasuriya envisions a total of 60-70 varieties in the near future.\n\n1872 Clipper Tea is blended and packaged by BP de Silva Group's tea production plant, Tea Tang, in Sri Lanka. Tea Tang Ltd, incorporated in 1979, also packages tea for the Sri Lanka Tea Promotion Board and Sri Lanka's Jetwing hotel chain, while its overseas clients include the Raffles Hotel in Singapore.\n\nThe 1872 Clipper Tea label was started over a year ago; leveraging on its existing expertise. The majority of Tea Tang's products actually head to the Middle East and Russia, which are also Sri Lanka's biggest customers.\n\nThe year 1872 refers to the time the BP de Silva family owned its first tea plantations, which sprawled over 100 acres. In 1970, the government nationalised tea estates so each family was limited to only 50 hectares. The family subsequently sold its plantations, but kept its hold on the tea production business instead.\n\nGlobal leader\n\nBP de Silva is, of course, a household name in Singapore, originally associated with jewellery - a business established in Singapore by entrepreneur Balage Porolis de Silva, who had set sail in the late 1800s from Galle to Singapore. The company has, over 140 years, grown from a small jewellery business on High Street to a diversified conglomerate, focusing on luxury goods and commodities.\n\nRehan, the second child of BP de Silva Group chairman Sunil Amarasuriya works closely with the company's Value Addition division in Colombo which looks after the development of brands.\n\nTea production, by the way, is a lot more complex than tea-bagging a bunch of dried leaves. Over at Tea Tang, there is a whole laboratory, full of canisters and tin boxes of tea leaves, dedicated to the daily tasting of teas and grading.\n\nEvery week, thousands of samples from over 600 estates in Sri Lanka get sent to the factory, and tea tasters sip their way through some 2,000 cups a week. \"We have three master tea-tasters with a combined 100 years of experience in tasting teas,\" explains Mr Amarasuriya.\n\nTea leaves are then blended so that they always fit the taste requirements of clients. \"Customers from the Middle East like their tea strong in flavour and colour. And colour is also important in Hong Kong,\" he explains.\n\nJapanese and British tea-drinkers like theirs with milk, so there tends to be more Dimbulla-originated tea in the blend which is more tannic and bitter. Nuwara Eliya teas, on the other hand, are lighter.\n\nTea Tang does the tasting, cleaning, blending, bagging, packaging and then exporting of Ceylon Tea. In Sri Lanka, Tea Tang is one of the more progressive factories in terms of utilisation of technology.\n\nFurther plans are being made for more modern machines in various parts of the production facility. As part of their business model, the group is constantly on the look-out for the latest technology, in order to be at the forefront and a global leader in tea production .\n\nBP de Silva have moved from its River Valley office to a new building at Leng Kee, where the entire group's business concerns will be located on one floor. The space will allow for a warehousing and even a tea-tasting room, says Mr Amarasuriya. Grander plans for the tea business are a-brewing.\n\nuihoon@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/technology/amazons-workspaces-brings-cloud-enterprise-users", "site_title": "Amazon's WorkSpaces brings the cloud to enterprise users", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nAmazon's WorkSpaces brings the cloud to enterprise users\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 17, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nAMAZON Web Services (AWS) has always been a big player in the bits and bolts deep in the back-end data centre space, but the cloud giant is moving up the value chain and may soon start streaming your PC to you.\n\nAndy Jassy, senior vice-president of AWS took to the stage last week during the company's developer conference in Las Vegas to announce a new service called WorkSpaces.\n\nThe product will see the company supplying virtual desktops to end-user enterprises, run and managed off Amazon's sprawling clouds all over the world. A virtual desktop differs from the regular PC, in that the virtual instance exists on a server elsewhere, not on the PC itself. The user's PC acts as a window through which the desktop image is accessed. This marks quite the radical step in the direction of taking over more of a company's IT resources, because AWS' main play has always been in the infrastructure space.\n\nAWS is the e-commerce giant, infrastructure-as-a-service product, and it owns nine huge data centres globally serving storage and computing resources on tap.\n\nFor some, the virtual desktop service may be reminiscent of Sun Microsystems' grand vision of thin client computing back in the late-1990s. It released the Sun Ray, a workstation that was just a connected display, that relied on a server elsewhere to serve its apps. The aim was to save companies money on expensive, standalone desktops, and instead benefit from a pooled resource, centrally managed.\n\nThis sounds a lot like the cloud, and perhaps the Sun thin client was too early for its time. They couldn't achieve the same kind of performance for high-end needs such as graphics, because of the latency happening over the wires between thin client and central server. HP and Dell still make thin clients, and Dell's marketing material brands them as \"cloud client computing\" devices.\n\nMore recently, Google's been eyeing the thin client market. In 2011, it introduced its Chromebook devices - low-cost laptops that run very minimal Linux-based OSes, designed just to power a browser that will pull apps from Google's Web app family.\n\nBut thin clients have never really taken off because it took added complexity for companies to manage and virtualise desktops from internal servers, when supplying individual laptops and desktops worked fine. Moreover, connectivity needs to be relatively stable in order to ensure an undisrupted experience, so that remains another factor that companies need to beef up.\n\nStill, Amazon thinks it has a one-up over the competition because of its experience in optimising networks for latency issues. It uses more recently developed streaming protocols such as PC-over-IP, which compresses the amount of data needed to be transmitted, and uses variable bit rate (VBR) encoding to overcome choppy performance that can occur during unstable connections.\n\nEssentially, keeping things lean going over network connections is aimed at making the experience better and more reliable for end-users.\n\nFurthermore, it's priced the service very competitively. A basic subscription offering one virtual CPU and 50 Gbs (gigabits) of storage space costs US$35 per user, a month, and 2 virtual CPUs (central processing units) and 100 Gbs of storage is US$60 per user, per month.\n\nThe subscription price takes care of the Windows OS licence cost, and an extra US$15 will give users access to Microsoft Office and anti-virus software, said Mr Jassy. Still, some companies continue to have reservations about abandoning regular workstations for the virtual variety. Brian Chen, CEO and founder of Taipei-based mobile development firm Herxun, said users need to ensure a strong mobile signal to use the desktop on the go, which is reliant on telcos and largely out of companies' control.\n\nAdditionally, many public agencies won't be able to jump on the cloud this way, because sensitive data needs to remain on private servers, he said.\n\n\"From previous experience, the virtual desktop is only suitable for limited situations,\" he said, indicating that the resilience of virtual desktops needs to be more widely proven before mainstream businesses consider it a viable option.\n\nAmazon's keenness to enter the end-user experience is also buoyed by the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) trend, said Mr Jassy. One interesting feature of WorkSpaces is the ability to transfer the desktop between devices, allowing users to carry their desktops with them. For instance, a user on a desktop will be able to transfer everything they were doing to a tablet device or a phone, and continue work uninterrupted. \"You can use it on your laptop, close it when you leave the office, and switch to your Android or iOS device, and the desktop picks up where you left off,\" he said.\n\nBYOD refers to a growing trend in the enterprise where users are choosing to use their own devices - in particular smartphones and tablets - for work, and requesting access to company data through them.\n\nAccording to Gartner, worldwide smartphone sales hit 250.2 million units in the third quarter of 2013, representing an increase of 45.8 per cent over the same period last year.\n\nSmartphones accounted for 55 per cent of overall phone sales during the quarter, and the Asia-Pacific continued to lead the growth with 77.3 per cent more smartphones sold in the quarter, year-over-year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This sent Asian and other stocks soaring yesterday. Tokyo re-entered \"bull market\" territory as the Nikkei average broke above the 15,000 level.\n\nThe yen's fall against major currencies, including the euro and the Australian dollar, was less expected because the continuation of quantitative monetary easing in the US would normally imply dollar weakness, just as tapering hints had earlier sent the dollar jumping, analysts said.\n\nBut comments on Thursday in the parliament by Finance Minister Taro Aso that the country must retain the means to intervene in foreign exchange markets appear to have convinced markets that Japan is intent on maintaining a yen rate no stronger than 100 to the dollar.\n\nThe yen sank to 100.3 at one point in Tokyo yesterday before recovering slightly. It also sank below 160 to the pound and hit 134.93 against the euro and 93.66 against the Australian dollar.\n\nThe yen could sink as low as 105 to the dollar in the coming months, Deutsche Bank strategist Taisuke Tanaka was quoted as saying, while a trader at a Japanese bank said that \"the yen can only go down now\", adding that Ms Yellen's dovishness will spark a fresh rally in risk assets.\n\nIn Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average rose 289.51 points, or 2 per cent to 15,165.92 taking the index up by 7.7 per cent this week alone and by 46 per cent over the year to date.\n\nOther Asian equity markets also moved up sharply. Seoul's Kospi climbed 1.9 per cent and was on track for its largest gain in four months, while Australia added 0.8 per cent and shares in Shanghai surged 2.3 per cent, encouraged by reforms reportedly approved by China's Communist Party at its national congress.\n\n\"Confirmation of Yellen's dovishness, a risk-embracing mood toward equities globally, and considering the amount of idle cash that had been waiting to be invested, this kind of move (is not) a huge surprise,\" SMBC Nikko Securities general manager of equities Hiroichi Nishi said in Tokyo.\n\nFor Japan, the fall in the yen's value is welcome news at a time when exports have been flagging, presenting a threat to the success of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Abenomics policies, aimed at boosting economic growth and ending deflation in Japan.\n\nJapanese firms are reluctant to undertake the capital investment needed to meet the targets of Abenomics until they can be sure the yen will not enter a new round of strength. Mr Aso's comments this week were aimed at creating an environment for yen stability at around current rates, analysts said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

New offices, laboratories, a large clean room and training facilities will be added to the premises.\n\nThe Business Times understands that the California-based company had pumped about $55 million into the expansion. With this, Edwards has invested about $95 million in Singapore since 2005.\n\nIn May 2008, it first opened its $20 million Singapore facility, the company's third heart valve production site in the world after those in the US and Switzerland. It is also Edwards' Asia-Pacific headquarters.\n\nDonald Bobo Jr, Edwards' corporate vice-president for heart valve therapy, said: \"We are proud that our continued investment in Singapore will result in employment opportunities for hundreds of additional workers to join the 1,000 employees currently working for Edwards in the region.\"\n\nYeoh Keat Chuan, the managing director of the Singapore Economic Development Board, described Edwards' expansion here as \"a strong affirmation of Singapore's competitiveness as a location for advanced medical technology manufacturing\".\n\nIn September, Edwards, together with Baxter Healthcare and Becton Dickinson Medical, led the pilot phase of the MedTech Industry Transformation Initiative (Miti), a programme aimed at increasing overall productivity and value of jobs in Singapore's medtech sector.\n\nThe New York-listed company posted a net income of US$293.2 million last year, on sales of US$1.9 billion.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

After the results were announced, F&N said the company and its treasury \"will consider their options in light of this result and will make an announcement at the appropriate time\".\n\n\"While F&N can, legally speaking, push for default, it's a matter of principle and bondholders seem to want a better price, but the question is what is the fair value (of the bonds),\" he said.\n\nSaid a fund manager: \"If the terms were attractive and fair, most would have voted in favour.\" He warned, however, that \"triggering a default is very dangerous\" as it could cause other outstanding loans to trigger on cross default clauses. \"If they cause a default by going through with the demerger without the waivers, this could be seen as an act of very bad faith. Such actions can adversely impact future debt offerings,\" he said.\n\nOn Thursday, holders of the $108.25 million 5.5 per cent notes due 2016 and the $200 million 6.0 per cent notes due 2019 voted against the tabled amendments, while voting for the $80 million 3.15 per cent bonds due 2018 was adjourned because of the lack of a quorum.\n\nResolutions for another three bond issues were passed. These were the $220 million 2.48 per cent bonds due 2016, the $150 million 3.62 per cent bonds due 2015, and the $50 million 2.45 per cent bonds due 2015.\n\nF&N had offered to pay 100 cents on the dollar and a fee worth half of the note's coupon and the accrued interest on the date that it can call the securities, its Extraordinary Resolution documents showed.\n\nAccording to earlier reports, the terms offered for F&N's higher coupon bonds were below market value, and some investors in the $108.25 million 5.5 per cent notes due 2016 had reportedly said they intended to vote against the proposal.\n\nF&N needed approval from holders of six series of bonds given that the proposed spin- off would breach some of the bond covenants. The company had also indicated its intention to include in all the bond issues the option to call by June 30, 2014, which means a redemption of all of the outstanding bonds well ahead of maturity.\n\nThe company, controlled by Thai billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi, had asked holders of $808.3 million of bonds to waive certain default clauses, allowing the company to buy back the securities on or before June 30, 2014, for a fee, according to the Oct 28 announcements.\n\nF&N plans to spin off its property division through a Singapore listing later this year. The conglomerate is seeking to separate that division from its other operations, including its beverages and publishing units, to focus on each unit's individual expansion strategies. Mr Sirivadhanabhakdi, ranked by Forbes as Thailand's second-richest man, had gained control of F&N in a $13.8 billion takeover completed in February this year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.
