Much to the chagrin of professional designers who have undergone the rigorous channels of education and practical experience, such is the scenario in Singapore. Influencers, renovation contractors and even homeowners are marketing themselves as designers, creating an industry prone to unscrupulous players who prey on unsuspecting clients.\n\nSuch is the problem that the Society of Interior Designers Singapore (Sids) faces as it enters its 30th year with little headway made in raising professional standards, including a government-supported but voluntary accreditation scheme that has seen slow take-up. Complicating matters is the existence of other professional bodies, and a public that is not familiar with any of them. So, what needs to be done for a fragmented industry that suffers from a less than stellar reputation? And what can established designers do to protect their craft and reputation? In this week\u2019s BT Lifestyle, we speak to Sids and other stakeholders to see what lies ahead.\n\nStill on the topic of home design, we visit a long house. Literally.

PHOTO: AFP\n\n[SINGAPORE] It is midway into the earnings season for Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (S-Reits), with most of them having posted their first-quarter results.\n\nClosely watched among investors and analysts is the impact that US tariffs will have on these S-Reits. They are also\n\nlooking out for the Reit managers\u2019 plans\n\nto counteract the effect of the tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.\n\nThe\n\n\u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs\n\nannounced on Apr 2 sparked a\n\nsell-off of S-Reits that week\n\n, although the sector has since rebounded. As at Wednesday\u2019s (Apr 30) close, the iEdge S-Reit index had climbed 8.7 per cent since Apr 9, when the tariffs took effect.\n\nAs the earnings season progresses, most S-Reits with exposure to affected markets have acknowledged the potential drag from the tariffs on their financial results.\n\nHowever, more clarity is needed. Reit managers should go beyond general acknowledgments and provide concrete details about the specific sectors and assets exposed, and how they intend to respond to the potential fallout.\n\nGiven the broad scope and global reach of the proposed tariffs, their long-term economic impact could be significant, especially if Trump proceeds with implementation.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nFor S-Reits, which are only now seeing a performance rebound amid easing interest rates, failing to address these risks in a meaningful way could undermine recent gains.\n\nScant details\n\nA total of 14 S-Reits had posted their Q1 results as of Apr 30. Many gave a brief overview on how they would be affected by the tariffs.\n\nIn general, they seemed to feel that an economic slowdown would lead to tenants pulling back or hesitating on lease commitments. For instance, the manager of\n\nMapletree Pan Asia Commercial Trust\n\nnoted in its recent fourth-quarter results that tenants had become more cost-conscious, and decision-making among them had \u201cslowed down quite a lot\u201d.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nSingapore\u2019s growth outlook turns more cautious as US tariffs deliver \u2018negative shock\u2019: MAS\n\nStoneweg European Reit Q1 DPU falls 3.7% to 3.374 euro cents\n\nCapitaLand Ascendas Reit reports positive rental reversions despite dip in occupancy in Q1\n\nS-Reits rebound from early April sell-off\n\nMPACT struggles with leasing demand, cost of debt as Q4 DPU tumbles 14.8%\n\nSuntec Reit sees subdued retail sales, expects office, retail tenants to hold off expansion plans\n\nMore\n\nOthers, such as\n\nCapitaLand Ascott Trust\n\n, offered more details. Its\n\nQ1 business update\n\ndisclosed that while the Reit might take a hit to the demand for lodging, its diverse mix of guests and longer-stay accommodation type would go some way to blunt the impact.\n\nSeveral Reit managers also said they would adopt a wait-and-see approach, given that the tariffs were announced a month ago, and there have been constant changes to their scope.\n\nThe chief executive officer of\n\nSuntec Reit\u2019s\n\nmanager, Chong Kee Hiong, for example, said at a briefing on Suntec Reit\u2019s Q1 results that the Reit manager was\n\nwatching for trends in retail tenant sales\n\n, with the tariffs having been implemented only in April.\n\nHowever, overall, S-Reit managers have so far offered few details on how the tariffs would hit their portfolios, and how they intend to address the fallout.\n\nThese include specific details on the extent to which a Reits\u2019 assets may be affected, or how exactly the manager will mitigate the impact of the tariffs.\n\nFor instance,\n\nKeppel Reit\u2019s\n\nbusiness update for Q1\n\nfocused on its performance, but offered little by way of how the economic situation could affect its outlook.\n\nFar East Hospitality Trust\u2019s\n\nbusiness update presentation\n\nfor Q1 acknowledged that trade tensions could cloud economic outlook, but added that the outlook for tourism remained positive, with more visitors returning to Singapore post-pandemic, wooed by new attractions.\n\nDetails \u2013 such as the extent to which a recovery in visitor arrivals would offset the negative economic outlook, or how the trust intends to respond to tourists spending less \u2013 would give investors a better understanding of the trust\u2019s strategy during this period.\n\nGranted, most S-Reits provide only business updates for their Q1 financial results. These are typically released as announcements on the Singapore Exchange, and do not give Reit managers much scope to share their outlook.\n\nFurthermore, not all Reits hold briefings for analysts or the media. Such platforms would otherwise provide an avenue for market watchers to probe Reit managers further on their strategies.\n\nNevertheless, given how quickly the market moves in response to Trump\u2019s policy pronouncements \u2013 which the US president has changed several times now \u2013 it is imperative that S-Reits keep investors informed of their game plan should the worst happen.\n\nWhat managers can do\n\nS-Reit managers can afford to provide more detail on their response to Trump\u2019s tariffs. Beyond acknowledging the tariffs\u2019 impact, they can explain the extent to which the tariffs will affect their bottom lines.\n\nThey can also give more details on the specific assets or geographies which will be hit by the tariffs, and lay out scenarios based on the severity of the tariffs.\n\nRather than say that they will adopt a \u201cwait-and-see approach\u201d, managers should go a step further to share active plans they may have to mitigate the impact of tariffs. This could be anything ranging from incentives to encourage tenants to commit to leases quickly, or more extreme measures like divesting of assets or rejigging their portfolio mix by subsectors or geographies.\n\nWhile their Q1 business updates may not be the best platform to share these plans, Reit managers can look for alternative platforms, such as upcoming annual general meetings or Singapore Exchange announcements, to do so.\n\nSuch moves would quell investor concerns during a turbulent economic period and instill confidence in the Reit management.\n\nThere is still some way to go until the end of the current earnings season. With S-Reit performances expected to see an uptick overall due to lower interest rates, it would do them good to keep the positive momentum going.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Demand for the won may rise with South Korea on track to join the FTSE World government Bond Index next year. Singapore, which is rated AAA, is likely already attracting central bank investments. China\u2019s trade linkages with the world make the renminbi a \u201cnatural candidate\u201d for potential reserve re-allocations.\n\n\u201cWe believe the diversification away from US dollar should persist, as this trend has been well entrenched for the past decade,\u201d they wrote.\n\nCentral banks are accelerating searches for alternatives to the greenback, jolted in part by sanctions on Russia in 2022 that saw Washington seize US dollar reserves from Moscow and cut the nation off from the international financial system. Jitters around the greenback are amplified even more now as US President Donald Trump\u2019s policies threaten to upend global trade and the world\u2019s economy. They\u2019ve been adding to gold reserves as well, underpinning demand for the metal.\n\nOf course, the US dollar remains the world\u2019s key currency, used for the majority of central bank reserves and for the purchase of commodities like oil, in large part because no significant alternative has emerged. Its central role will not easily be displaced in part because the size of the Treasury market makes it the most liquid in the world, allowing investors to trade large blocks of securities without affecting the price.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nMAS eases policy slightly, lowers inflation forecasts after Trump tariffs threaten growth\n\nUS dollar slumps against Singdollar as tariff uncertainty continues to roil markets\n\nRenminbi starts to lead the dance in Asean\u2019s currency moves\n\nSingapore\u2019s dollar in pole position to extend lead in Asia\n\nWhere in Asia to stretch your Singapore dollar furthest\n\nUS dollar surges against Singapore dollar, major currencies on Trump\u2019s tariffs\n\nMore\n\nHowever, recent trading across the US$7.5 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market underscores cooling demand for the US dollar: Bloomberg\u2019s greenback gauge has dropped more than 7 per cent since a February peak as US exceptionalism wanes.\n\nThe US dollar remains around 17 per cent overvalued based on Goldman\u2019s metrics, the strategists wrote. That is adding to investor worries as US economic policy uncertainty spikes to levels not seen since the start of the pandemic in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate a rotation to other global assets, of which Asian assets could be a subset,\u201d the strategists wrote.

PHOTO: AFP\n\nIN THE weeks after the re-election of Donald Trump, the bosses of America\u2019s tech giants worked hard to ingratiate themselves with the returning president, congratulating him publicly and dutifully turning up to his inauguration. Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of Meta, gushed that it was nice to have an administration that was \u201cproud\u201d of America\u2019s tech champions.\n\nThere was good reason for the obsequiousness. During his campaign, Trump referred to Meta as an \u201cenemy of the people\u201d. Many in his Maga (make America great again) movement have accused America\u2019s tech giants of censoring right-wing views. In 2021, JD Vance, now Trump\u2019s vice-president, called the behemoths \u201cparasitic\u201d. Even the techies surrounding Trump, such as Elon Musk, belong to a different Silicon Valley tribe that is suspicious of Big Tech.\n\nThree months in, and the bosses of America\u2019s most valuable firms have little to show for all their toadying. Trump appears unwilling to spare them from the trustbuster\u2019s snare, and is adding to their troubles with his trade war. On Apr 29, the White House accused Amazon of a \u201chostile and political act\u201d after the company was reported to be planning to display the cost of tariffs for items sold through its website. (Amazon swiftly clarified that the idea had been considered only for Amazon Haul, where it sells ultra-cheap products, and that it would not be implemented.)\n\nSince Trump\u2019s inauguration, the combined market value of the five big platforms \u2013 Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft \u2013 plus Nvidia, America\u2019s semiconductor superstar, has fallen by US$2.3 trillion, or 16 per cent. Just how bad could things get?\n\nStart with antitrust. Neither Andrew Ferguson, whom Trump appointed as chair of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), or Gail Slater, his pick as head of the antitrust division of the Department of Justice (DoJ), has shown much interest in halting the cases against Big Tech begun by the Biden administration. Slater, who on Apr 21 described Google as a threat to freedom of speech, freedom of thought and \u201cfree American digital markets\u201d, inherited two cases against Alphabet, its corporate parent. On Apr 17, a district judge ruled in one of them that the company operates an illegal monopoly in digital advertising. In the other case, a court ruled last year that Google\u2019s search business was an illegal monopoly, too; hearings to decide on remedies will start on May 2. The DoJ has urged the court to force Google to sell its Chrome browser, alongside other changes to its business.\n\nAlphabet is not alone. On Apr 14, hearings began in the FTC\u2019s case against Meta, which the regulator accuses of having maintained an illegal monopoly (which the company denies) through its purchase of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. Meta has reportedly sought Trump\u2019s help in reaching a settlement with the FTC, with little success so far. The antitrust agencies are also suing Amazon and Apple and investigating Microsoft and Nvidia, for good measure.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nOn top of all this comes Trump\u2019s trade war. Apple assembles four-fifths of its iPhones and Macs in China, which explains why its share price fell by almost a quarter in the week after Trump unveiled his \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d on Apr 2. It recovered somewhat when carve-outs were announced for smartphones and PCs. Even so, an earlier 20 per cent rate on Chinese goods still applies. Prices for iPhones are likely to rise, weighing on already slowing sales. Apple is now reportedly planning to shift assembly of its America-bound smartphones from China to India by the end of 2026.\n\nNvidia is in the cross-fire, too. Prices for its chips, which are mostly produced abroad, are likewise set to rise for American customers, which may cool the firm\u2019s red-hot growth. An even bigger problem is its business in China, which accounted for 13 per cent of revenue in 2024. The American government recently barred it from selling its H20 chip there without an export licence. Nvidia has said that the new rules will wipe US$5.5 billion from the value of its inventory, a sign that it expects to be granted few permits, if any. Although analysts reckon it will design a new, less powerful chip for export, the new restrictions will give a leg up to Huawei, a Chinese tech giant that is making ever more sophisticated artificial-intelligence (AI) chips.\n\nAs for Amazon, Bernstein, a broker, reckons that about a fifth of the goods it sells in America through its e-commerce platform are made in China, many of which now face import duties of 145 per cent. On May 2, the\n\nde minimis\n\nexemption, which spares from tariffs packages valued below US$800, will also be removed for Chinese wares.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\n\u2018Worst-case scenario\u2019 for tech wipes US$1.4 trillion from Nasdaq\n\nTech billionaires mired in their reality-distortion fields\n\nTech billionaires take centre stage at Trump inauguration\n\nMaking matters worse, America\u2019s tech giants are also at risk of becoming a \u201cretaliatory lightning rod\u201d in the trade war, notes Mark Shmulik of Bernstein. China\u2019s watchdogs are already probing Alphabet and Nvidia. Last year, the country introduced rules to phase out products made by Microsoft, such as Windows, from government computers. Investors worry that an iPhone ban among state officials could follow.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, has talked of hitting America\u2019s tech giants with levies in response to Trump\u2019s tariffs. On Apr 23, the EU slapped Apple and Meta with 700 million euros (S$1 billion) in fines for breaching its Digital Markets Act \u2013 though that was much less than the maximum possible figure, perhaps signalling that Brussels wants to avoid an escalating trade conflict.\n\nThen there are the indirect effects of Trump\u2019s tariff war. Ad sales from Chinese e-commerce companies such as Shein and Temu, which rely heavily on the\n\nde minimis\n\ntrade, could be jeopardised. Last year, Meta said that such firms accounted for a tenth of its ad revenue the year before. On Apr 25, Sundar Pichai, Alphabet\u2019s boss, admitted on an earnings call that the removal of the\n\nde minimis\n\nexemption would create a \u201cslight headwind\u201d for its ad business. That may be just the start. If, as expected, America\u2019s economy slows as a result of tariffs, ad spending more broadly could slump.\n\nBig Tech\u2019s cloud-computing revenues may take a hit as well. Enterprise customers and startups are already delaying committing themselves to contracts owing to uncertainty over economic conditions, according to JPMorgan Chase, a bank. A pullback in spending on AI, on which the tech giants are pinning their hopes for growth, seems possible. Johnson & Johnson, a pharmaceutical firm, recently said that it is cutting spending on AI projects that are not generating returns.\n\nSome remain optimistic that the rest of the president\u2019s term will be brighter for Big Tech. An insider at one of the giants says he believes that Trump, unlike his predecessor, is willing to \u201cgo out to bat\u201d for America\u2019s tech champions abroad. Trump\u2019s first 100 days do not bode well, though. It could be a tricky four years for the tech titans.\n\n\u00a92025\u00a0The Economist Newspaper Limited.

A similar framework could be expanded to other Asean markets as well,\u201d he said.\n\nAsean IPO prospectus\n\nBeyond traditional trade and investment, Asean-BAC has laid out 12 initiatives, including a regional capital market framework, a common carbon framework and digital trade platforms to boost intra-Asean economic activity.\n\nOne key project, the Asean initial public offering prospectus, is close to launch. Under this initiative, companies could list in their home markets while raising funds from retail investors across Asean countries through a unified framework.\n\nNazir said that Malaysia\u2019s Securities Commission is working with its counterparts in Thailand and Singapore, and that such cross-border fundraising drives could start as early as next year.\n\n\u201cWith the current level of harmonisation, it shouldn\u2019t be difficult to top up disclosure requirements between markets like Malaysia and Singapore,\u201d he said.\n\nDigitalisation of private-sector cross-border trade procedures is also a priority for the Asean-BAC; Malaysia is developing a new digital trade platform intended to link with other Asean systems.\n\nRenewable energy is the future\n\nAsean member states must continue to collaborate in joint projects and economic sectors to enhance the region\u2019s collective power, he stressed.\n\n\u201cClean energy, particularly renewable energy, is one such area,\u201d he said, and cited the\n\nAsean Power Grid\n\nas a strong example amid rising global demand for clean energy.\n\nThe Asean Power Grid is a programme to interconnect the electricity grids of all 10 Asean member states by 2045. It aims to enhance energy security by enabling cross-border power sharing, especially from renewable sources such as hydro, solar and wind.\n\nNazir noted that this initiative is crucial for maximising the use of South-east Asia\u2019s diverse clean-energy potential, which would ensure a stable and affordable electricity supply for its growing population.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But it is the Lord\u2019s truth. By coveting Canada\u2019s sovereignty, Trump turned the semi-Trumpian Conservative party\u2019s projected landslide into defeat in the space of weeks. Not bad for the US president\u2019s first 100 days. He might do a similar favour for Australia\u2019s incumbent Labor party this weekend without even threatening to annexe the country.\n\nBut Carney deserves credit for nailing his opponent Pierre Poilievre to the Trumpian mast. Instead of Poilievre\u2019s me-too \u201cCanada First\u201d, Carney proclaimed \u201cCanada Strong\u201d. He did so while also distancing himself from Justin Trudeau, his deeply unpopular predecessor, as Liberal prime minister. There are lessons here for Democrats. Had Kamala Harris thrown Joe Biden under the bus with the same dispatch as Carney did to Trudeau, she may have defeated Trump last November. Most of all, Carney showed that non-populists can win in the right conditions \u2013 in this case as a foil to the world\u2019s chief populist.\n\nFull disclosure: I have known Carney since the early 1990s. Though his skills as an economist and central banker were clear, Monday was the first time he stood for election. He turned 60 last month, two days after replacing Trudeau. It is hard to overstate how improbable this looked a few months ago. Carney worked for Goldman Sachs in London and New York. Then he headed the Bank of Canada. After that he became governor of the Bank of England. Then he joined a global investment firm. He promoted environmental, social and governance issues at the UN \u2013 two abbreviations that would normally debar him from impolite company. If globalism had a name and a face, it would be Carney\u2019s.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Opinion & Features\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nDollar-selling is becoming a bubble, which may burst, HSBC says\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nSingapore shares hit new high; STI up 0.5%", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/4a93bd5ab45fd4ac878e8b5ded1c2d47e7983c9c5c9b0520fef00f4cb54d0b4a?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Mark Carney, Canada's prime minister and leader of Canadas Liberal Party, during an election night event at TD Place in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, early on Tuesday, April 29, 2025.

The firm\u2019s US$1.6 trillion investment-management arm has not set a fundraising target but it could gather \u201ca few billion US dollars in the near to medium term,\u201d Neha Champaneria Markle, head of private equity solutions, said in an interview.\n\nPrivate equity firms once catered almost exclusively to institutions and ultra-wealthy clients able to analyse the risks \u2013 and stomach the potential losses \u2013 from putting money into investments spanning several years, potentially through shifts in the economy. That exclusivity frustrated throngs of smaller investors eager to hunt returns beyond public markets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a front-row seat to the opportunity, appetite and demand for private equity in a format that is more user-friendly for individual investors,\u201d Markle said. \u201cThere\u2019s enough of an understanding about how private equity works, how these types of vehicles work, for us to be comfortable launching our strategy.\u201d\n\nThe fund will be evergreen, meaning clients can periodically withdraw or contribute more capital. It will initially be available only to Morgan Stanley clients, with plans to open it more broadly at a later date, Markle said.\n\nAlternative and traditional asset managers are rushing to develop more offerings for that wider audience.

That followed a similar reduction at the previous meeting in February.\n\nThe central bank on Wednesday cut its growth forecast for 2025 to 2 per cent, down from just above 2.5 per cent seen in February and 2.9 per cent predicted in December.\n\nIt said there were downside risks to growth and US trade tariffs could weigh in the second half of the year, and if the trade war escalated, then growth could be just 1.3 per cent this year.\n\nGrowth next year was seen at 1.8 per cent in the central bank\u2019s \u201creference\u201d scenario and 1 per cent in its worst-case scenario.\n\n\u201cThe US trade policies and potential retaliations from major economies will cause significant changes in the global economic, financial, and trade landscape,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nFriday, 8.30 am\n\nAsean Business\n\nBusiness insights centering on South-east Asia's fast-growing economies.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\n\u201cThis process is only beginning and subject to high uncertainties, with the global economy likely to grow at a slower pace.

The other eight had expected no policy change.\n\nThe central bank also said it would closely monitor the baht currency, which rose as much as 0.4 per cent after the rate decision, while the main stock index gained 2 per cent. Despite the trade fears and sluggish economic demand, the baht has still gained nearly 3 per cent this year as the US dollar faltered.\n\nReflecting growing risks, the BOT lowered its 2025 headline inflation forecast to 0.5 per cent, down from 1.1 per cent seen in December and below its target range of 1 to 3 per cent. It predicted core inflation at 0.9 per cent this year versus 1.0 per cent seen earlier.\n\nThe BOT cut its export growth forecast to 0.8 per cent this year from 2.7 per cent seen previously.\n\nThe central bank reduced its projections for foreign tourist arrivals \u2013 a key growth engine \u2013 to 37.5 million this year, from 39.5 million seen in December.\n\n\u201cWe think today\u2019s easing will be the last for the foreseeable future as the MPC (monetary policy committee) likely will adopt a wait-and-see approach with regards to the lingering tariff uncertainty,\u201d said Miguel Chanco, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.

This was partly offset by higher borrowing costs in MIT\u2019s Japan portfolio, added the manager.\u00a0This brought distributable income in the three months to S$95.8 million.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nTuesday, 12 pm\n\nProperty Insights\n\nGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThe figure includes the distribution of a net divestment gain of S$13.4 million from the\n\ntwo factories in Tanglin Halt\n\n, and the distribution of a net compensation of S$1.9 million for a redevelopment project that was recognised in the first quarter.\n\nThe distribution will be paid out on Jun 13, after the record date on May 9.\n\nOn a full-year basis, MIT\u2019s DPU rose 1 per cent to S$0.1357, from the previous financial year\u2019s S$0.1343.\u00a0This followed a 2.1 per cent increase in revenue to S$711.8 million, and NPI growing 2 per cent to S$531.5 million.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nThese Singapore names are potential winners from election Budget, tariff volatility: Maybank\n\nMapletree Industrial Trust proposes US$11.8 million divestment of US data centre\n\nData centres in Asia must rethink cooling for a more responsible future\n\nThe manager attributed the improved performance to higher contributions from its data centre in Osaka and the newly acquired mixed-use facility in Tokyo, and new lease and renewals across various Singapore properties.

PHOTO: AFP\n\n[WASHINGTON] US consumer spending increased solidly in March as households boosted purchases of motor vehicles to avoid higher prices and shortages due to tariffs, but that did little to change economists\u2019 views that the economy had shifted into lower gear.\n\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, surged 0.7 per cent last month after an upwardly revised 0.5 per cent gain in February, the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis said on Wednesday (Apr 30). Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending would rise 0.5 per cent, after a previously reported 0.4 per cent increase in February.\n\nThe data was included in the advance gross domestic product report for the first quarter that was published earlier on Wednesday, which showed GDP contracted at a 0.3 per cent annualised rate last quarter, weighed down by a record surge in imports.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs have fanned fears the economy is facing a period of tepid growth and high inflation, commonly referred to as stagflation. Some economists are expecting a recession. Trump sees tariffs as a tool to raise revenue to offset his promised tax cuts and to revive a long-declining US industrial base.\n\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index was unchanged in March after advancing 0.4 per cent in February.\n\nIn the 12 months through March, PCE prices increased 2.3 per cent after rising 2.7 per cent in February. Stripping out the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index was also unchanged. That followed a 0.5 per cent gain in the so-called core PCE inflation in February. In the 12 months through March, core inflation increased 2.6 per cent after advancing 3.0 per cent in February.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nUS economy contracts in the first quarter; tariffs unleash flood of imports\n\nThe Fed tracks the PCE price measures for its 2 per cent inflation target.

But since Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d, policymakers have warned that permanent damage has already been done to the global economy, even if there is an eventual resolution to the tensions.\n\nThe 20 nations sharing the euro currency saw their economy expand by 0.4 per cent in the first quarter, beating expectations for 0.2 per cent, driven by quick growth in Spain, Eurostat data showed.\n\n\u201cWell, that was a relief,\u201d HSBC economic Fabio Balboni said. \u201cPrivate consumption is now \u2013 finally! \u2013 rising broadly in line with real wages. In addition, investment is also showing signs of life, likely on the back of faster Next Generation EU implementation and lower borrowing costs for firms.\u201d\n\nAlthough Europe\u2019s promising growth is likely to be temporary, the bloc well outperformed the US, which contracted in Q1, weighed down by a deluge of goods imported by businesses eager to avoid higher costs.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThe underlying eurozone trend was somewhat weaker than the headline figures suggest, however, as data was distorted by a 3.2 per cent expansion in Ireland, fuelled largely by activity among big foreign companies based there for tax reasons.\n\nGermany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, grew by just 0.2 per cent while France expanded by 0.1 per cent and Italy by 0.3 per cent, suggesting that excluding Ireland, the headline figure would be more modest.\n\nInflation also appears to have slowed, according to national data.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nUS economy contracts in the first quarter; tariffs unleash flood of imports\n\nPrice growth in Germany dipped to 2.1 per cent from 2.2 per cent, coming within striking distance of the ECB\u2019s 2 per cent target, while in Italy it held steady at 2.1 per cent.\n\nThe figures are not game-changers but confirm the ECB\u2019s message that inflation is largely defeated and figures will now oscillate around target for the remainder of the year.\n\n\u201cFor the ECB, today\u2019s growth and inflation reports clearly pave the way for some additional, though very gradual and measured, rate cuts, without giving any reasons for panic,\u201d ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.\n\nInterest rate cuts are coming mostly because the outlook has darkened significantly.\n\nSome of Europe\u2019s largest firms \u2013 including Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz on Wednesday \u2013 have issued warnings in recent days that tariffs will weigh on profits, hold back sales and may curtail investment.\n\nMeanwhile, a key sentiment indicator published on Tuesday showed a major dip, erasing any hope of a recovery and putting the indicator on a downward trend after it flatlined for most of 2024.\n\nThe ECB has already said that on top of the trade war, the financial market turbulence set off by US policies and the general deterioration in sentiment will all dampen growth.\n\nBut the bloc was seen expanding by less than 1 per cent even before Trump\u2019s tariff bombshell, suggesting that any other major damage would put it close to a recession.\n\nMost economists and policymakers say that the US is bound to take a bigger hit than other economies, however, creating an incentive for the Trump administration to scale back its tariffs, some of which have already been suspended.\n\nIncreased spending by the new German government on defence and infrastructure could help insulate the eurozone, but that will take time to legislate and implement, suggesting  little to no fiscal boost is likely this year and Europe will also suffer.

Hopefully, they can take some of the learnings back home.\u201d\n\nBoth Sodexo and Insead collectively delivered more than 3,600 meal kits last year to marginalised communities.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nFriday, 2 pm\n\nLifestyle\n\nOur picks of the latest dining, travel and leisure options to treat yourself.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nAriza stressed the importance of using healthier options that impact seniors\u2019 health positively.\n\nSoy chicken rice was chosen because it is a \u201cstaple\u201d in Singapore, he added, and it is \u201crelatively easy to cook in a setup like this\u201d, making it easier for seniors to pick up this skill.\n\nLiew Zi Qi, senior programme executive at Goodlife Studio (Bukit Purmei), Montfort Care, said: \u201cLearning healthy cooking is very important, so that they will be aware of their own condition to (accordingly) match the correct diet.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nFood From The Heart rallies automotive community for food drive\n\nFood Bank Singapore joins MBS, Las Vegas Sands programme to enhance community impact\n\nSupporting seniors\u2019 independent living\n\nJames Middleditch, senior director of operations and campus services at Insead, said this initiative will enable seniors to live more independently. More seniors now live alone \u2013 a Ministry of Health report stated that the number grew from 58,000 in 2018 to 79,000 in 2022, and this figure is expected to continue rising.\n\n\u201cSingapore has an ageing population, but also a low fertility rate, so now we\u2019re getting this imbalance. You\u2019re going to have smaller families taking care of seniors, so more and more seniors will be obliged to live independently. Supporting them in this journey \u2013 giving them knowledge and skills \u2013 will enable them to live a much more fulfilled... life,\u201d he noted.\n\nLiew added that there has been an increased focus on preventive healthcare, especially in Singapore\u2019s current ageing society.\n\n\u201cAt an early stage, it\u2019s important to share with seniors how to keep up a good and healthy lifestyle. At this active ageing centre, we encourage them to live healthily and stay active,\u201d she said.\n\nThese participatory sessions with Sodexo chefs also help to tackle social isolation \u2013 another issue that seniors living alone face. Sodexo and Insead plan to roll out more events to benefit the community throughout the year.\n\nSG60: Doing Good Through Food builds on Sodexo and Insead\u2019s past community initiatives, which include a waste management programme and farm-to-table demonstrations.\n\nIt is also part of Montfort Care\u2019s Good Makan! initiative, aimed at empowering seniors through food, confidence-building and social connection.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWhat's moving the markets?

The data published last week showed that China\u2019s ports processed a total of 6.3 million standard 20-foot containers, 10 per cent more than in the same period last year, according to Bloomberg calculations.\n\nThe ministry did not respond to a faxed question asking why the data was not released and when it planned to announce it. China has a five-day-long national holiday starting on Thursday, with markets, businesses and many government offices closed until next week.\n\nThe delay marks the first time this year that the data has not been announced on Monday, according to the releases on the ministry\u2019s website.\n\nIn the more than two years that it\u2019s made such figures available on a weekly basis, it has skipped one release and delayed 16 others, with the longest held back by four days in mid-2023.\n\nThe number of ships taking goods from China to the US has slumped in recent weeks after the US imposed punitive tariffs of more than 100 per cent on most Chinese exports on Apr 2.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nChinese set to spend record US$1 trillion in local travel boom\n\nChina\u2019s factory activity falls sharply as Trump tariffs bite\n\nChina repeats vow to support jobs, economy as US tariffs hit\n\nChina March industrial profits rise, defying trade tensions\n\nChina vows to ready emergency plans, signals calm amid trade war\n\nMore\n\nEven so, at least through the week before last, the total volume of trade had held up, possibly as companies ship more to South-east Asia and other places where the US has suspended most tariffs.\n\nChina is scheduled to release April trade data on May 9, which will give the first official look at what has happened with trade with the US and other countries since US President Donald Trump announced the levies.

Lutnick has signalled he could withhold promised Chips Act grants as he pushes companies in line for federal semiconductor subsidies to substantially expand their US projects, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nIn March, TSMC chief executive officer C C Wei joined Trump at the White House to unveil plans to invest an additional US$100 billion in US plants that will boost its output on American soil. The spending adds to US$65 billion in planned TSMC investments in the US and would eventually bring its American presence to a half-dozen plants for advanced wafer fabrication and a couple more for advanced packaging.\n\nLutnick told CNBC in an interview on Tuesday the Trump administration was able to get the additional US$100 billion investment without any promise of subsidies. \u201cYou know what the Trump administration paid for that? Zero. It\u2019s tariffs that brought that in. So 40,000 of construction employees, and then 20,000 full-time employees, here for the far-distant future as we bring semiconductors here. This is the point of the Trump tariff model,\u201d he said.\n\nTSMC\u2019s CEO said on an earnings call in April that the construction of the second plant in Arizona was already completed and the company was working on speeding up the production schedule. The company previously said that the first factory entered high-volume production in the fourth quarter of last year with yields comparable to Taiwan factories.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nTSMC shows off new tech for stitching together bigger, faster chips\n\nTSMC upbeat on outlook as robust AI demand offsets tariff uncertainty\n\nAMD set to produce its CPU chip at TSMC plant in Arizona\n\nTSMC sales beat estimates as AI demand soars\n\nMore\n\nWei added that the third and fourth plants will use its most advanced N2 and A16 process technologies and the fifth and sixth plants will use even more advanced technologies.

At 2.5 tonnes, demand was up 35 per cent year on year (yoy), the highest since World Gold Council (WGC) started keeping records in 2010.\n\nGold investment demand in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand also grew steadily at double-digit rates yoy, the WGC\u2019s Q1 gold demand report released on Wednesday (Apr 30) indicated.\n\nBut Vietnam\u2019s demand for gold bars and coins dropped 15 per cent on the year to 12 tonnes of gold purchased. This was attributed to higher premiums on the limited availability of gold products as well as local currency depreciation, said WGC.\n\nGold jewellery demand declined across the Asean countries, aligning with the global trend amid record-high gold prices. Demand in Singapore, in particular, fell 20 per cent on the year to 1.7 tonnes of gold jewellery purchased.\n\nFan Shaokai, head of Asia-Pacific (ex-China) and global head of central banks at WGC, noted that global jewellery demand recorded its lowest level since it was stifled by the Covid pandemic in 2020, which was \u201cunsurprising\u201d, given that gold hit 20 all-time price highs in Q1.\n\nCentral banks\u2019 demand dips\n\nGlobal central banks entered their 16th consecutive year of net buying with 243.7 tonnes of gold added to their reserves in Q1, driven by the need for portfolio diversification, risk management, inflation hedging and protection against geopolitical and market volatility, noted Fan.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nFriday, 8.30 am\n\nAsean Business\n\nBusiness insights centering on South-east Asia's fast-growing economies.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThis was, however, down 21 per cent from the 309.9 tonnes purchased in the same quarter last year.\n\nDespite the fall, the demand, in absolute terms, was still \u201chealthy\u201d at 24 per cent above the five-year quarterly average and 9 per cent below the average over the last three years of elevated demand, highlighted WGC.\n\nIn particular, the Monetary Authority of Singapore sold three tonnes of gold in the quarter, maintaining its total gold holdings at about 220 tonnes.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nSingapore investors lead Asean peers with 22% surge in purchase of gold bars, coins in 2024\n\nChina\u2019s factory activity falls sharply as Trump tariffs bite\n\nGold prices steady as investors await key US data, tariff updates\n\nOverall gold demand\n\nGold investment demand, comprising both gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as well as bars and coins, stood at 551.9 tonnes, up 170 per cent on the year. This was driven by a strong revival of demand for gold ETFs, registering net inflows of 226.5 tonnes, compared with net outflows of 113 tonnes for the same period last year.\n\nOverall gold demand remained steady at 1,206 tonnes, a 1 per cent increase on the year. This includes demand for investment, jewellery\u00a0fabrication, central bank purchases and technology uses.\n\n\u201cAmid the ongoing geopolitical tensions and global market volatility, gold, a traditional safe-haven asset, continues to perform strongly, with global gold demand reaching its highest first-quarter level since Q1 2016,\u201d said Fan.\n\nOutlook for 2025\n\nWGC expects near-term stagflation risks, medium-term recession risks, elevated stock-bond correlations, an expected acceleration in US deficits and continued geopolitical tensions to continue to drive gold demand for investment.\n\nLouise Street, senior markets analyst at WGC, said: \u201cLooking ahead, the broader economic landscape remains difficult to predict, and that uncertainty could provide upside potential for gold.\u201d\n\nDemand for gold bars and coins, specifically, is expected to \u201cstay resilient rather than strong\u201d, given that surging prices would temper geopolitical risk motives, said WGC, noting gold jewellery demand to be weaker than expected.\n\n\u201cAny stronger jewellery recycling response may be tempered by low near-market stocks, trade-ins, old-gold collateral activity and little distress-driven selling,\u201d added WGC.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Singapore\n\nSingapore boosts support for Timor-Leste as it prepares to join Asean\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:36 PM\n\nEconomists upgrade 2025 outlook after\u00a0\nQ2 GDP turns out better than expected\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:02 PM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nDaily Debrief: What Happened Today (Jul 14)\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:30 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nSingapore GDP up 4.3% in Q2, well above market expectations amid US tariff pause\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:00 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/8bc2d342de67e0df5c6508486ea7bf0f85f650478f51539ffe038fc02188132e?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Gold prices have hit a high and it has hurt footfall at jewellers.

As such, Beijing has advanced this year\u2019s stimulus plans to mitigate the economic pain of losing, at least temporarily, its biggest customer.\n\n\u201cWe expect the manufacturing PMI to be in contraction in May, but it is expected to rise to about 49.5, driven by an increase in stable growth policies,\u201d said Wang Qing, chief macro analyst at Oriental Jincheng.\n\nHe said further cuts to interest rates and the amount commercial banks must hold in reserve may be needed as conditions worsen.\n\nOn Monday, the vice head of China\u2019s state planner said the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) would roll out new policies over the second quarter in line with the prevailing economic conditions of the time.\n\nThat followed pledges by the Communist Party\u2019s elite decision-making body, the Politburo, on Friday to support firms and workers most affected by the duties.\n\nThe general consensus among China observers is a second trade war with the US will significantly weigh on growth, but the NDRC\u2019s Zhao Chenxin said he was confident the country would achieve its 2025 economic growth target of around 5 per cent.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund, Goldman Sachs and UBS all recently revised down their economic growth forecasts for China over 2025 and into 2026, citing the impact of US tariffs \u2013 none of them expect the economy to hit Beijing\u2019s official growth target.

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\n[LONDON] Britain will bring cryptocurrencies under compulsory regulation, finance minister Rachel Reeves said on Tuesday as the government signalled it would cooperate closely with the United States on the best approach towards digital assets.\n\nThe new draft laws will extend existing financial regulation to companies involved in crypto, aligning Britain with the US, rather than the European Union which has built rules tailored to the industry, experts said.\n\nBritain\u2019s first set of draft rules for the sector comes as US President Donald Trump has embraced crypto and vowed to roll back regulatory curbs on the industry, worrying critics. Euro zone finance ministers said last month they were concerned the US embrace could affect euro zone monetary sovereignty and financial stability.\n\nReeves said she had discussed crypto regulation with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent during a visit to Washington last week, and that the two countries planned to discuss this further in June.\n\n\u201cUnder the new rules, crypto exchanges, dealers and agents will be brought into the regulatory perimeter - cracking down on bad actors while supporting legitimate innovation,\u201d the finance ministry said in a statement following Reeves\u2019 announcement.\n\n\u201cCrypto firms with\u00a0UK\u00a0customers will also have to meet clear standards on transparency, consumer protection, and operational resilience,\u201d it added.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nAround 12 per cent of British adults own or have owned cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or ethereum, up from 4 per cent in 2021, the government said.\n\nBank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has long warned of the risks to investors from bitcoin, which he does not view as a secure store of value like mainstream currencies.\n\nHowever, he has seen more of a case to regulate so-called stablecoins, a type of digital currency that seeks to keep a fixed value relative to US dollars or other assets.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nMulti-party politics defines British elections this week\n\nUK's Reeves talks trade with US's Bessent after stressing EU ties\n\nStarmer\u2019s energy summit gig bumps up UK\u2019s post-Brexit profile\n\nUK rushes to find materials to keep British Steel plant running\n\nMore\n\nThe government\u2019s draft rules said stablecoin issuers would be subject to regulation, but only if the issuers are based in the\u00a0UK.\n\nThe finance ministry said it aimed to finalise the new legislation by the end of the year. The rules build on initial proposals made in 2023.\n\nSome critics have said regulating the sector could give a false sense of security to the public about the risks posed by digital securities that can have little or no underlying value.\n\nHowever, Nick Price, financial services and crypto specialist at law firm Osborne Clarke, called it a \u201csimple and straightforward piece of legislation\u201d that would bring a great deal of certainty and stability and consumer protection.\n\n\u201cThe move explicitly aligns the\u00a0UK\u00a0with the US approach of \u2018crypto as securities\u2019 \u2013 and represents a divergence with the EU\u2019s more tailored approach to crypto under the Micar regime,\u201d Price added, referring to EU rules that came into force in December.\n\nLinklaters financial services lawyer Simon Treacy said the new rules defined the scope of the assets and activities that would be regulated, but a lot more detail was to come as regulators developed rules for regulated firms.\n\nReeves also said she would set out broader plans for boosting the growth and competitiveness of Britain\u2019s financial services industry on July 15 in her annual Mansion House speech, the culmination of a consultation process that began in November 2024.\n\nIn last year\u2019s Mansion House speech, Reeves said British financial regulators had gone too far in squeezing out risk in the 15 years after the global financial crisis.\u00a0REUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:54 PM\n\nSuspended Thailand PM Paetongtarn hit by ethics investigation, source and media say\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:07 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/b81e6b6949add8032b54fc12e510885970a560f848d240d88d2cceb009c7b780?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Reform UK\u2019s predecessor, UKIP, also led by Farage, was the first party other than the Conservatives or Labour to win a UK national election in over 100 years since the Liberals."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/bb10ccbc82ca49f333e67bc091eda132b2f2c61729afd790635e52a3198d1c04?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Reeves sought to show Trump\u2019s team during her trip to Washington that she shares the president\u2019s concerns about the world economy \u2013 in particular China\u2019s export-heavy model \u2013 but she has also said that high tariffs are not the answer."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/13375362b2b48d69122659c3f504592b38d621c6fb17e2e95071a4be9b0a5eef?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Over Apr 24-25, UK prime minister Keir Starmer co-hosts with the International Energy Agency (IEA) a big international conference on energy security."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/adb2f8d7cde2f510c8079ab32661c3c4ca5a9d65f374f12f62929a3692868ede?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Officials are trying to obtain materials such as coking coal to keep the blast furnaces running to stop them from cooling and causing damage to the machinery."}]}

PHOTO: AFP\n\n[TOKYO] Japan\u2019s factory output fell last month, indicating flagging momentum for manufacturers as they coped with uncertainties surrounding US President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariff campaign.\n\nIndustrial production dropped 1.1 per cent in March compared with the previous month, the industry ministry reported on Wednesday (Apr 30). Economists had forecast a 0.4 per cent drop. Manufacturers predicted output will increase by 1.3 per cent this month.\n\nThe ministry also reported that retail sales increased 3.1 per cent in March compared with a year earlier, extending the streak of gains to 37 months.\n\nAutos, electronics and information and communication machinery were among sectors that made the biggest negative contribution to the results, while production of transportation machinery excluding autos increased, the ministry said.\n\nThe data are likely to fuel concerns over the trajectory of Japan\u2019s economy as authorities navigate challenges posed by US trade policy. A 25 per cent levy on US imports of steel and aluminium started in March, with a similar tax on autos and a baseline 10 per cent tariff on all goods kicking in earlier this month. The auto tariffs would hit the core of the nation\u2019s industry in particular, although Trump is now set to ease those duties.\n\n\u201cFactory output is weak and it will probably remain so with the impact of US tariff measures about to hit industry,\u201d said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. \u201cThere is no indication at all that manufacturers will be underpinning the overall economy.\u201d\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nWednesday\u2019s data back the case for the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to hold its policy settings steady when the board next sets policy on Thursday. Authorities have indicated they need more time to gauge the impact of the tariffs, and BOJ watchers have pushed back their expected time frames for another rate hike in light of the ambiguity.\n\nJapan\u2019s data stand in contrast to figures reported by South Korea and China, which both beat consensus expectations for March industrial production. China\u2019s output rose 7.7 per cent year on year while South Korea\u2019s increased by 5.3 per cent year on year, with analysts citing front-loading demand as a key driver in both cases.\n\nThe combined US tariffs will have a profound impact on Japan\u2019s manufacturing base, especially if the universal 10 per cent tax reverts to the 24 per cent rate that Washington initially announced before giving a three-month grace period. Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Research Institute, estimates they will slash Japan\u2019s exports to the US, the biggest shipment destination, by 10 per cent, weighing heavily on factory activity.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nJapan to resist Trump efforts to form trade bloc against China\n\nCore inflation in Japan\u2019s capital sharply accelerates in April\n\nJapan\u2019s factory activity shrinks on tariff woes, services perk up: PMI\n\nJapan\u2019s inflation quickens as rice prices gain most in 50 years\n\nMore\n\nExport growth slowed more than expected in March, with shipments to the US rising 3.1 per cent by value, decelerating from February\u2019s 10.5 per cent advance.\n\nThe impact of Trump\u2019s tariff campaign has already filtered through to some Japanese companies, with about 10 per cent saying the duties have affected their businesses, according to a survey by the Ministry of Finance this month. Canon last week lowered its profit forecast for this year by about 10 per cent owing to the US levies and a stronger yen against the US dollar.\n\nIndications of trouble among large manufacturers is a worrisome sign for financial officials and the government, as large businesses have until now set the tone for strong wage increases, a vital factor to sustain inflation.\n\nTo be sure, some Japanese companies have seen results bolstered in the short term by the tariffs. Toyota Motor\u2019s sales in North America climbed 7 per cent in March, fuelled by a last-minute rush to buy cars before the duties kicked in. That impact is expected to fade from this month.\n\nMeantime, the darkening global economic outlook and the stronger yen may be taking a toll on spending by inbound tourists, who have contributed greatly to demand in recent years. Inbound spending at department stores dropped 10.7 per cent last month from a year earlier, the first reduction in three years, according to the Japan Department Stores Association.\n\nThat impact does not appear to have been reflected in the latest retail sales data, as Wednesday\u2019s figures showed growth in retail sales accelerating year on year. Still, sales fell 1.2 per cent month on month.\n\nJapanese consumers have become more careful with discretionary spending due to soaring costs of daily necessities after price gains have stayed at or above the BOJ\u2019s inflation target for about three years.\n\n\u201cA drop in retail sales shows weakness in consumer spending amid the elevated cost of living,\u201d Minami said. \u201cInbound spending is probably in a lull and households are struggling with inflation with their sentiment going down, so consumer spending is unlikely to clearly pick up anytime soon.\u201d BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:54 PM\n\nSuspended Thailand PM Paetongtarn hit by ethics investigation, source and media say\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:07 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/919d4c97f3fe921997883b362373d64cf799a9b32d3ce20e2a78975489f77020?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "(FILES) This file photo taken on December 8, 2023 shows workers on a production line during a media tour of the \"Nissan Intelligent Factory\" at the Nissan Motor Tochigi plant, the company's largest in Japan, in Kaminokawa, Tochigi prefecture, some 105 kms (65 miles) north of Tokyo.

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nPublished Wed, Apr 30, 2025 \u00b7 08:13 AM\n\n[NEW YORK] President Xi Jinping\u2019s diplomats are fanning out across the world with a clear message for countries cutting deals with Donald Trump: The US is a bully that cannot be trusted.\n\nChinese officials are racing to turn foreign governments against the US inside a 90-day window Trump has granted all nations \u2013 except China \u2013 to strike trade deals during a tariff reprieve. Once those pacts are in place, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said he wants US allies to \u201capproach China as a group\u201d, giving his side more leverage in negotiations.\n\nWhile US allies from South Korea to the European Union rely on Washington for security and have the incentive to appease Trump economically, China is approaching the tariff battle on a more equal footing. Beijing has devoted years since Trump\u2019s last trade war to weaning its economy off many US exports, and has the world\u2019s largest military by number of active soldiers.\n\nXi has resisted getting on the phone with Trump and his government is demanding a removal of \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, even as the US insists the other side takes the first step in de-escalating. In doing so, China is casting itself as a champion of the rules-based order and is calling on other countries to stand with Beijing against Washington.\n\n\u201cThis is not just about China-US,\u201d said Wu Xinbo, director at Fudan University\u2019s Center for American Studies in Shanghai. \u201cIt is really about the international trade and economic system.\u201d\n\nWu, who last year led a Foreign Ministry delegation to meet politicians in the US, said other governments should realise Beijing\u2019s efforts have benefited them. \u201cIf China hadn\u2019t stood up to the US, how would the US give them a 90-day pause,\u201d he added, suggesting tariffs on China have given Trump cover to halt levies on other nations. \u201cThey should appreciate that.\u201d\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nIn Washington, central bank governor Pan Gongsheng told economic chiefs last week the US had \u201cseverely violated\u201d their legitimate rights and interests. China\u2019s top diplomat Wang Yi rallied the Brics bloc of nations at a Monday (Apr 28) meeting in Brazil to join Beijing in resisting Trump\u2019s demands.\n\n\u201cIf you choose to remain silent, compromise and retreat, it will only allow the bully to become more aggressive,\u201d he said.\n\nHours later, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry branded Washington an \u201cimperialist\u201d power in a video with English subtitles that claimed US moves to limit Japanese exports last century severely harmed companies such as Toshiba.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nTrump predicts China would \u2018eat\u2019 tariffs, lessening US impact\n\nChina\u2019s Xi pushes AI and \u2018Global South\u2019 opportunity amid US trade war\n\nBeijing will not engage in market dumping, China\u2019s ambassador to India says\n\nChina says willing to cooperate with US firms after Boeing spat\n\nSome Chinese exporters hasten US dollar conversion amid trade war\n\nChina vows to stand firm, urges nations to resist \u2018bully\u2019 Trump\n\nMore\n\n\u201cBowing to a bully is just like drinking poison to quench thirst, it only deepens the crisis,\u201d it said. \u201cChina won\u2019t back down so the voices of the weak will be heard.\u201d\n\nWhile many partners such as the EU are diametrically opposed to Trump\u2019s tariffs, many will also be wary of moving closer to China. Beijing\u2019s military aggression towards Taiwan and in the South China Sea, where it has territorial disputes, has caused alarm in the region, while Xi\u2019s support for Vladimir Putin after his invasion of Ukraine has attracted fierce opposition in Europe.\n\nBeijing also faces concern from other countries that a flood of cheap Chinese goods will be diverted from the US towards their markets. During a Group of Seven meeting last week, members agreed to encourage Beijing to address its domestic imbalances, according to Japan\u2019s Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato.\n\nMost countries are still working towards a US deal, even if they are slow in reaching any consensus. India is perhaps making most progress, with officials hammering out an agreement that spans 19 categories and would give the US greater market access for farm goods, among other sectors.\n\nFor US allies that depend on China for critical minerals and other goods, the trade war has left them with few easy options, as Beijing warns against striking deals that could harm its interests. Trump\u2019s top economic advisers have discussed asking nations to impose secondary tariffs on imports from countries with close China ties, Bloomberg previously reported.\n\nBeijing is now extending olive branches to regional rivals it\u2019s clashed with over military issues and territorial disputes, as it tries to prevent countries from agreeing to such terms.\n\nChina will host its first all-Korean pop concert in nine years next month, in a sign authorities are preparing to lift the so-called \u201cK-wave ban\u201d imposed informally in 2016 in retaliation for Seoul allowing the US military to deploy a missile defence system.\n\nChinese Premier Li Qiang this month sent a letter to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba urging a coordinated response to Trump\u2019s tariffs, Kyodo News reported, citing a Japanese government official. Tokyo plans to resist any US efforts to form a bloc against Beijing \u2013 its biggest trading partner \u2013 according to Japanese government officials.\n\nTo the surprise of Indian officials, China showed a marked change in approach to contentious border issues during a meeting last month, according to sources familiar with the matter, who did not want to be named as discussions are private.\n\nChinese officials took a conciliatory tone on India\u2019s concerns on matters such as grazing rights of shepherd communities along the disputed boundary, they said.\n\nIndia\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs and Ministry of Defence did not respond to e-mails seeking further information.\n\nOther signs of a thaw include an expected visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Beijing this year for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization conference. China has also offered to buy more from India to help New Delhi reduce the trade deficit, and agreed to restart an annual Hindu pilgrimage along the disputed border in Tibet.\n\nChina\u2019s ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, has also gone on a PR offensive, publishing an opinion piece titled\n\nAmerica\u2019s Tariffs Are Turning the World Back to Law of the Jungle\n\n. That followed an article in a separate publication where Xiao blasted Trump for targeting remote sub-Antarctic islands. \u201cNot even penguins are safe from the US trade tariffs,\u201d he added.\n\nLower-level Chinese delegations are also hitting the road. Central authorities have urged provincial officials to seek new export markets, according to several managers at state-owned merchants, who have been asked to join overseas trips. They asked not to be identified discussing private matters.\n\nLatin America is proving popular because it has more transparent policies than some African nations and greater market potential than Asean members, the sources said, citing Argentina as a destination officials had visited.\n\nBeijing\u2019s diplomatic offensive is not going to convince US partners to abandon Washington and embrace Beijing, according to Neil Thomas, a fellow for Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute\u2019s Center for China Analysis.\n\n\u201cBut it could make it more difficult for the Trump administration to present a united front against Beijing through coordinated export controls or joint military exercises,\u201d he added.

However, the existence of a so-called \u201cwhitelist\u201d had not been previously reported.\n\nThe quiet approach allows Beijing, which has repeatedly said it is willing to fight till the end unless the US lifts its 145 per cent tariffs, to maintain its public messaging while privately taking practical steps to provide concessions.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many and which products have been included on the list, which authorities have not shared publicly, the two sources said, declining to be named as the information was not public.\n\nCompanies instead are being privately contacted by authorities and notified of the existence of a list of product classifications that would be exempted from the tariffs, according to one of the sources who works at a drug company selling US-made medicines in China.\n\nThe company was contacted by the Shanghai Pudong government on Monday about the list, the source said, adding the firm had previously lobbied for tariff exemptions as it relies on US technologies for some of its products.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\n\u201cWe still have many technologies we need from the US,\u201d the source said.\n\nAnother source said some companies have been asked to privately contact authorities to inquire if their own imported products qualify for the exemption.\n\nThe list of exempted products also appears to be growing and China has waived tariffs on ethane imports from the US, Reuters reported on Tuesday.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nChinese solar losses deepen even before worst of trump tariffs\n\nChina asks drugmakers, hospitals to find US import substitutes\n\nXi is trying to turn world against US as Trump cuts deals\n\nTrump predicts China would \u2018eat\u2019 tariffs, lessening US impact\n\nChina\u2019s Xi pushes AI and \u2018Global South\u2019 opportunity amid US trade war\n\nMore\n\nMajor ethane processors had already sought tariff waivers from Beijing because the US is the only supplier.\n\nUS President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he thought a trade deal with China was on the horizon. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be a fair deal,\u201d he said.\n\nChina\u2019s commerce and customs ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nGauging impact\n\nTwo other sources said China is also surveying companies to gauge the impact of the tariff war.\n\nIn a recent meeting, authorities in Eastern China asked a foreign business lobby group to \u201ccommunicate all critical situations caused by tariff tensions to evaluate specific cases\u201d, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\nThe source declined to name the city where the authorities held the meeting as the gathering was not public.\n\nGovernment officials in Xiamen \u2013 a city in southeastern Fujian province that is home to a major port and a manufacturing base for electronics \u2013 also sent out a survey to companies to assess tariff impacts, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe survey was sent to textiles firms and semiconductor companies and included questions on products they trade with the US, and the estimated impact of the US and Chinese tariffs on their business.

Still, the medical goods substitution plan marks China\u2019s effort to not be held to ransom in the long run as its relations with the US have continued to deteriorate.\n\nChina\u2019s retaliatory tariff against US imports is already taking a toll on hospitals and drugmakers. Without tariff exemptions, some imported pharmaceutical goods have seen prices hikes, local medical science online portal Dingxiangyuan reported on Monday (Apr 28), citing suppliers and researchers.\n\nSome hospitals have 5 per cent of their drug supply coming from the US, which is now subject to China\u2019s 125 per cent tariff, Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, told reporters during a briefing in Beijing on Friday.\n\nWhile China has long pushed for domestic replacement of imported medical products and already manufactures most commonly used medicines and ingredients as well as essential medical equipment, Chinese drugmakers still import substantial amounts of raw materials from the US, due in part to lower quality of domestic alternatives.\n\nReplacing cutting-edge medical gear from the US in the near term remains challenging, as domestic firms have yet to develop such technically sophisticated products.

PHOTO: AFP\n\nPublished Wed, Apr 30, 2025 \u00b7 12:01 PM\n\n[NEW YORK] Chinese solar manufacturers continue to plunge deeper into the red, and the outlook is getting gloomier as sky-high tariffs on exports threaten to compound domestic oversupply.\n\nFive of the biggest names in the industry \u2013 JA Solar Technology, Jinko Solar, Longi Green Energy Technology, Tongwei and Trina Solar \u2013 published first-quarter earnings overnight, racking up over eight billion yuan (S$1.4 billion) in losses between them. Their combined loss last year was less than two billion yuan, when two of the companies were still profitable.\n\n\u201cPrices across the main segments of the solar industrial chain were low in the first quarter,\u201d Jinko said in its earnings statement. \u201cThis, combined with disruptions in demand caused by changes in international trade policies, pressured profit margins in each segment of the integrated solar supply chain.\u201d\n\nSo, the first takeaway is the industry\u2019s so-called self-discipline measures \u2013 basically voluntary output controls agreed by dozens of manufacturers last year \u2013 have not really worked yet, although Jinko said in its statement that self-regulation had shown a gradual improvement over the period.\n\nThe second is that conditions will only deteriorate if the worst of the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs come into force. Those include staggering levies as high as 3,521 per cent on four South-east Asian nations where Chinese firms had based much of their production to circumvent US duties.\n\nNew tariffs\n\nThe new tariffs, which were announced earlier in April, should be finalised in the coming weeks, assuming that the US trade regulator determines the imports have been detrimental to American producers. That\u2019s likely to force another round of costly relocation for the troubled industry.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nSouth-east Asia\u2019s place in the sun just got dimmer\n\nUS punishing tariffs put South-east Asian solar exporters\u2019 China Plus One strategy in a bind\n\nUS imposes new duties on solar imports from South-east Asia\n\nCSI Solar, an affiliate of Nasdaq-listed Canadian Solar, said on Monday it\u2019s preparing to move capacity to other regions facing lower duties. JA Solar said earlier this month it\u2019s planning to speed up efforts to globalise its manufacturing, including by opening a plant in Oman.\n\nIn the meantime, the ramp-up in domestic installations that\u2019s supported demand in recent months is likely to meet dead air after a Jun 1 deadline, when less favourable policies on solar pricing come into effect.\n\nSo, expect profitability to improve sequentially in the second quarter, said Daiwa Capital Markets analysts including Dennis Ip. But that\u2019s \u201clikely to be unsustainable due to a potential demand vacuum in the third quarter\u201d, according to a note from the brokerage.

PHOTO: AFP\n\nUdaibir Das\n\nPublished Wed, Apr 30, 2025 \u00b7 07:00 AM\n\nHISTORY has a habit of repeating itself, particularly with recent shifts in global trade and financial instability in developing economies.\n\nWhen the Latin American debt crisis hit in the 1980s, it was sparked by oil price shocks and deteriorating trade terms, and then made worse by an over-reliance on foreign, US dollar-denominated debt. Decades later, the 1997 Asian financial crisis followed a similar script, with unsustainable current account deficits and risky currency exposures linked to trade flows and volatile capital. Even the euro area debt crisis was rooted, in part, in persistent regional trade imbalances that pushed sovereigns and banks to the brink.\n\nThese were no accidents or stand-alone events. They reveal a persistent threat that trade and, crucially, trade finance, can amplify underlying financial sector weaknesses. Currency mismatches, precarious dependence on the US dollar and concentrated credit risks often lie dormant \u2013 until a trade shock wakes them up.\n\nFamiliar tremors in today\u2019s landscape\n\nVulnerabilities from trade shocks or a new global trade regime ripple outward, potentially crippling financial systems and inflicting serious harm on the broader economy.\n\nThe echoes of the Covid-19 pandemic are still felt in fractured supply chains, brutally exposing the risks of narrow export bases. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine sent food and energy prices soaring, hammering the terms of trade for import-dependent nations. The financial sector fallout is increasingly visible, not least in the growing risk aversion surrounding trade finance.\n\nData confirms the pressure points. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), over 55 per cent of cross-border bank lending to emerging markets and developing economies is still in US dollars, leaving trade finance exceptionally vulnerable to exchange rate volatility and sudden dollar liquidity crunches. The World Bank estimates the trade finance gap in sub-Saharan Africa alone now exceeds US$100 billion \u2013 a 30 per cent increase since 2019.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThese figures reflect real economic strain. Central banks from Ghana, Zambia and Ethiopia report rising non-performing loans, particularly in trade-dependent sectors. At the same time, regulators are seeing tighter credit conditions and weakening bank capital adequacy \u2013 flashing indicators that trade-related stress is embedding into bank balance sheets.\n\nThe United Nations Conference on Trade and Development warns that smaller economies are especially more vulnerable to tariffs, making financial risk management that much harder.\n\nWhile the high-level dangers \u2013 such as economic slowdowns, inflation spikes and market volatility \u2013 are well-flagged, there is less clarity on how these macrofinancial risks translate into practical changes in financial-sector supervision.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nThe spectre of dollar doomsday still looms\n\nTariffs on goods may be a prelude to tariffs on money\n\nHow are examination priorities shifting? Are data requests becoming more granular or frequent, specifically for trade exposures? Can there be a more explicit, forward-leaning approach that reassures exporters, importers, and bank and non-bank lenders?\n\nFinancial sector supervisors do not set trade policy, but ensure trade shocks do not capsize the domestic financial system. This requires moving beyond routine oversight to a pre-emptive, globally aware strategy.\n\nGetting ahead of the shock waves\n\nIn many cases, financial supervisors are still catching up. There is an urgent need to monitor trade-linked exposures more closely, from foreign exchange lending and trade credit exposures to cross-border liquidity reliance, especially for key banks.\n\nThis means that real-time dashboards need to fuse bank and non-bank data with external stress indicators: terms-of-trade shifts, commodity volatility, shipping woes and, crucially, fraying correspondent banking relationships vital for trade payments (a challenge recently acute in parts of East Africa).\n\nBanks and non-banks must also be tested against severe trade and FX shock core scenarios, not just edge cases. What happens if a major export market collapses or access to offshore US dollar funding suddenly dries up? Supervisors must start asking those questions now, not after the damage is done.\n\nIncreased transparency is vital. Uncertainty fuels fear, and clear, consistent disclosure from banks and large firms on FX exposures, maturity mismatches and hedging must become a proactive standard practice. Reliable data helps markets spot emerging vulnerabilities early. Meanwhile, regional regulators must strengthen cross-border cooperation, particularly where banking and non-bank groups operate across multiple markets.\n\nAbove all, financial-sector supervisors must communicate and signal their assessments and actions. Forward guidance on expectations (such as FX liquidity planning), planned stress tests or available resilience tools anchors market expectations and builds confidence. Proactive signalling shows preparedness, not panic.\n\nImplementing this is tough where resources are thin, mandates fragmented or politics intrusive. Understaffing and technical gaps are real constraints. However, solutions exist: regional pooling of functions, vibrant peer-learning networks and targeted technical assistance from bodies like the Toronto Centre, the International Monetary Fund and the BIS, focused on practical tools and diagnostics.\n\nThe next financial storm in many developing economies might be brewed not by a domestic credit boom, but by turbulent global trade, commodity swings or disruptions in US dollar funding critical for trade finance. For supervisors, the imperative is not predicting the next shock, but building resilience to withstand it. This demands a shift from compliance or standards-based checking to proactive risk management, informed by global tremors and grounded in local current account vulnerabilities. Preparedness, not prediction, is the watchword.

The Speciale A convertible, slated for the following quarter, will cost 462,000 euros. Both are big steps up from the 292,000 euro price tag on the base existing model, the 296 GTB.\n\nFerrari makes a tidy business of selling limited-run versions of its supercars to collectors willing to pay premiums for exclusivity. In the case of the 296 specials, customers also will take delivery of cars that are lighter and quicker, with both boasting total output of 880 metric horsepower, 50 more than their equivalent base models.\n\nThe specials are equipped with mid-rear-mounted V6 engines and electric motors that each eke out a little more power than the original 296 cars, which Ferrari continues to sell. The new models each weigh about 60kg reach top speeds of more than 330km per hour.\n\nThe 296 has driven a shift in Ferrari\u2019s business under chief executive officer Benedetto Vigna, who joined the manufacturer from chipmaker STMicroelectronics NV in 2021. Hybrids led by the 296 GTS were 51% of the company\u2019s shipments in 2024, up from just 22% in Vigna\u2019s first full year in the job.\n\nThe carmaker is also on track to unveil its first fully electric vehicle in October, Vigna said in an interview with Bloomberg Television\u2019s Francine Lacqua on Tuesday.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nPorsche\u00a0overtakes Ferrari as million-dollar car of the moment\n\nFerrari plans to raise prices for some of its cars in the US by as much as 10% due to President Donald Trump\u2019s new auto tariffs, the company said last month. The country is the company\u2019s biggest market, accounting for around a quarter of shipments. The carmaker produces all of its vehicles \u2013 almost 14,000 per year \u2013 in Maranello, Italy.

As that uncertainty filters through business decisions, we expect a more meaningful slowdown in real economic activity - in production, hiring, and investment.\n\n\u201cIn short, the rate shock may be behind us, but the real growth damage is just starting to unfold.\u201d\n\nInvestors are awaiting the release of key US inflation and economic growth data due later in the day, while jobs figures are lined up for Friday.\n\nThis week also sees the release of earnings from Wall Street titans including Microsoft, Apple, Meta and Amazon, which observers hope will provide an insight into how corporate America is dealing with the tariffs crisis, and how they expect to fare.

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\n[DETROIT] General Motors has pulled its annual forecast, reflecting the uncertain effects of US President Donald Trump\u2019s global trade war, even as it reported strong quarterly results.\n\nThe Detroit automaker\u2019s shares fell about 2.6 per cent in premarket trading.\n\nGM in January forecast net income between US$11.2 billion to US$12.5 billion for 2025, which did not include the impact of automotive tariffs.\n\nTrump\u2019s vacillating tariff policy has caused uncertainty in the automotive sector, which could be particularly hard hit, with analysts estimating new car prices could rise by thousands of dollars.\n\n\u201cWe believe the future impact of tariffs could be significant,\u201d GM chief financial officer Paul Jacobson said on a call with the media. \u201cWe\u2019re telling folks not to rely on the prior guidance, and we\u2019ll update when we have more information around tariffs.\u201d\n\nGM said on Tuesday (Apr 29) it was temporarily pausing its share buyback activity, pending more clarity on the economic situation.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThe automaker had in February said it would repurchase US$2 billion of shares by the first half of this year, with the rest to be bought at any point of the company\u2019s choosing.\n\nIn the first quarter, GM reported revenue rose 2.3 per cent to US$44 billion boosted by customers rushing to buy before prices jumped, surpassing analyst expectations of US$43 billion. Adjusted earnings per share of US$2.78 also exceeded analyst forecasts of US$2.74 per share. Net income fell 6.6 per cent to US$2.8 billion.\n\nGM also said that an analyst call to discuss these results and its updated 2025 full-year guidance, originally scheduled for Tuesday, had been moved to Thursday, May 1 following recent reports \u201cregarding updates to trade policy\u201d.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nGM leads first quarter US auto sales as tariffs loom\n\nTrump\u2019s 25 per cent auto tariffs imposed in early April are projected to increase costs by about US$108 billion for automakers in the US this year, according to a recent study from the Center for Automotive Research.\n\nThe Trump administration will reduce the effects of auto tariffs on Tuesday by alleviating some of the levies on foreign parts in US-made vehicles and keeping tariffs from stacking on imported vehicles.\n\nNumerous blue-chip companies have pulled their guidance for the year in response to tariff uncertainty.\n\nConsumer confidence has weakened dramatically since mid-February, when Trump ramped up his threats of levies on most foreign imports. Tesla last week did not give guidance, promising to revisit the issue in its next quarterly results.\n\nIn China, where GM is restructuring its business, the automaker saw some relief with equity income at US$45 million, up from a first-quarter 2024 loss of US$106 million.\n\nGM\u2019s positive first-quarter results come after the automaker reported a rise of about 17 per cent in US auto sales in the first quarter with high demand for trucks.\n\nThe tariffs, at least in the short term, have seemed to push some customers to make purchases with automakers such as Ford Motor and Stellantis, maker of Ram trucks and Jeeps, offering deeper discounts. New vehicle sales increased month over month and year over year in March, according to Cox Automotive.\n\n\u201cThe industry undoubtedly benefited from some pull-ahead demand from customers purchasing vehicles ahead of potential tariffs, particularly in March,\u201d Jacobson said on the media call. \u201cHowever, this strong demand environment has continued into April, where we have seen US deliveries up more than 20 per cent versus last year.\u201d\n\nGM has moved to increase truck output at an Indiana plant, as first reported by Reuters. GM will discuss other measures to mitigate the effects of tariffs on a Thursday morning analyst call.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t made any specific decisions about any major strategic changes until we get more clarity,\u201d he said of the tariffs, adding GM is \u201cfocused on actions that we can implement quickly, efficiently and with low near-term costs.\u201d\n\nBarclays in mid-April cut its 2025 GM earnings before interest and taxes estimates by 40 per cent based on lower volume and the gross tariff impact of about US$9.5 billion, since the automaker makes just under half of the vehicles it sells in the US outside of the country.\n\nGM shares have lost 12 per cent so far this year, trailing its primary rival Ford, which has gained about 3 per cent in 2025.

Key to this transformation has been the rise of semi-liquid evergreen fund structures \u2013 perpetual private market funds with periodic liquidity windows.\n\nThese innovative vehicles include: Europe\u2019s updated ELTIF 2.0 (European Long-Term Investment Fund) and the UK\u2019s Long-Term Asset Fund (LTAF); US interval funds; non-traded BDCs (Business Development Companies); and real estate investment trusts (Reits).\n\nThey are fundamentally changing how private wealth investors and, retail investors in particular, access alternatives. We are entering a new era in private markets \u2013 one marked by greater access, innovation and collaboration.\n\nDemocratising access\n\nThe momentum behind semi-liquid evergreen funds is undeniable. Investors who were once dissuaded by illiquidity, large ticket sizes, and capital call complexities are finding the new structures far more palatable.\n\nOver the past five years, the number of evergreen funds has nearly doubled to 520, representing at least US$350 billion of net asset value, Preqin data showed.\n\nThis trend aligns with a broader industry movement towards democratisation. Currently, private investors represent nearly half of global wealth \u2013 estimated at over US$140 trillion \u2013 yet account for only 16 per cent of private markets\u2019 total assets under management, which currently stand at US$13.1 trillion.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThe runway for growth remains extensive, and semi-liquid evergreen funds are a crucial bridge to narrow this gap.\n\nMany in the wealth management channel have embraced the semi-liquid evergreen fund structure as their preferred entry point into private markets. The funds\u2019 open-ended nature means that capital can be deployed on day one and begin compounding sooner.\n\nIt is hard to find a private markets general partner (GP) today that is not actively exploring the private wealth opportunity set and the viability of launching a semi-liquid evergreen fund.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nAzalea\u2019s next challenge: Private equity investing for the mass affluent\n\nWhy the venture capital secondary market is so hot right now\n\nFor private wealth intermediaries and their clients, there is a comprehensive and growing menu of private assets in semi-liquid evergreen format.\n\nThe market is populated with a diversity of opportunities across traditional strategies, multi-manager, multi-strategy and multi-asset semi-liquid funds.\n\nWe have seen launches from GPs as diverse as Apollo, Ares, Hg, Macquarie and Vista. Private banks and wealth managers are starting to manufacture their own internal semi-liquid evergreen funds of funds as an alternative to traditional closed-ended vintage programmes.\n\nPrivate markets GPs are becoming ever more creative in structure, liquidity management and investment strategy to make these vehicles work for a broader investor base.\n\nMany semi-liquid evergreen funds maintain a liquidity \u201csleeve\u201d \u2013 a portion in cash or public securities \u2013 to facilitate periodic redemptions.\n\nOften secondaries and co-investments are used to quickly deploy capital and reduce cash drag, ensuring that new inflows are put to work efficiently.\n\nNavigating operational and regulatory hurdles\n\nNo revolution comes without challenges. Semi-liquid evergreen funds by nature combine features of open-ended and closed-ended funds, which introduces operational complexity.\n\nGPs and their service providers must master new processes, including valuation of illiquid assets on a continual basis, managing subscriptions and redemptions and handling liquidity mismatches.\n\nCombining liquid and illiquid components necessitates expertise ranging from establishing valuation procedures and net asset value calculation frequency to implementing mechanisms such as gates and series. Onboarding investors into these funds can also be cumbersome today.\n\nRegulatory complexities also persist, notably through country-by-country variations.\n\nEurope has taken a big leap with ELTIF 2.0, which provides a unified passport to market evergreen funds to retail investors across the European Union, along with tax incentives and a clearer rulebook.\n\nThe UK introduced the LTAF, and the US has longstanding semi-liquid structures \u2013 interval funds, tender offer funds, and non-traded BDCs and Reits.\n\nOther regions are catching up: In Asia, markets such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia are at the forefront of adopting evergreen fund offerings, while others are still developing the necessary distribution and regulatory ecosystem.\n\nThese inconsistencies complicate efforts to distribute evergreen funds across multiple jurisdictions seamlessly.\n\nAdditionally, investor education remains a pressing issue. The term \u201csemi-liquid\u201d itself may inadvertently suggest more immediate liquidity than these structures realistically offer.\n\nClear and consistent messaging is crucial to managing investor expectations, preventing mis-selling, and ensuring that participants fully understand the liquidity profiles and risks inherent in these funds.\n\nThis is where fintech solutions platforms come into the equation, serving as outsourced product manufacturers and operations hubs, seamlessly integrating funds, private banks and fund administrators.\n\nThrough standardised regulatory compliant workflows that adapt to cross-border regulatory regimes, fintechs are critical facilitators of scale and operational efficiency.\n\nA collaborative path\n\nDespite these challenges, the trajectory of semi-liquid evergreen funds is decidedly upwards.\n\nThe reason for optimism is simple: These structures address a real need.\n\nThey enable wealth managers and family offices to craft portfolios that include the return potential of private equity, private credit, real estate and infrastructure without the severe liquidity lock-ups of the past.\n\nThey enable successful GPs to expand their investor base and secure stable, long-duration capital. And they create opportunities for individual investors (and their advisers) to benefit from institutional-quality assets and managers.\n\nIn short, evergreen funds are central to the democratisation of private markets \u2013 a theme that will only grow stronger.\n\nThe writer is founder and CEO, S64\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWhat's moving the markets?

It is about great power rivalries and whose industrial model will define the future. PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nAS THE United States and China ratchet tariffs to levels unseen since the Smoot-Hawley era \u2013 145 per cent on Chinese exports into the US, versus 125 per cent on American exports into China \u2013 the two superpowers are plunging into a new phase of economic confrontation.\n\nBut this is no longer just a trade dispute. It is an all-encompassing contest of political will, industrial strategy and global influence.\n\nThis latest surge in tensions is a culmination of long-building pressures since the 2018 invocation of Section 301 of the US Trade Act. The Trump administration at the time looked to counter what it called China\u2019s \u201cunfair trade practices\u201d, including forced technology transfers, subsidies for state-owned enterprises and constraints on market access.\n\nThese complaints, while not without merit, masked a deeper issue from the Chinese perspective: the erosion of American hegemony by China\u2019s rise and, accordingly, a shift in US strategy from engagement to active suppression.\n\nWho holds escalation dominance?\n\nEscalation dominance is a concept from strategic theory that refers to a party\u2019s ability to escalate a conflict in ways that impose greater costs on the opponent than on itself, thereby deterring the opponent from continuing or intensifying the conflict.\n\nOn the surface, the US commands dominance on trade, given its large deficit with China. Hence, tariffs wield significant coercive power. However, the administration\u2019s rationale to impose wide-ranging tariffs on more than 100 countries is rooted in a 17th century mercantilist framework that sees trade surpluses as profits and deficits as losses.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThis view is fundamentally flawed in an integrated global economy. According to Alpine Macro Research, two-thirds of total imports of American manufacturers are intermediate goods. Tariffs, in this context, could be more self-harming than protective.\n\nFor China, escalation dominance comes not from tariffs alone, but from its command of critical minerals. It controls upwards of 90 per cent of the world\u2019s refining capacity for rare earth elements \u2013 materials crucial for electric vehicles, semiconductors and defence systems. The critical mineral industry is sometimes described as a US$5 billion industry feeding into products worth US$8 trillion.\n\nWith control over every stage of the supply chain and consolidation of the industry into six major state-owned enterprise groups since 2016, China\u2019s end-to-end dominance is not easy for other countries to replicate.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nSome Chinese exporters hasten US dollar conversion amid trade war\n\nChina says on \u2018right side of history\u2019 in trade standoff with US\n\nChina is also less vulnerable to economic pressure today. Exports to the US now account for just 14 per cent of China\u2019s total exports, down from 20 per cent in 2016. As a share of gross domestic product, those exports have fallen below 3 per cent.\n\nMoreover, its economy has undergone several years of painful adjustment from the real estate bust, as well as excesses in the financial system. The Chinese government has also been conservative on large-scale fiscal stimulus in past years, which puts them in a stronger position to mitigate the fallout from the disruptive decoupling.\n\nWhile the US\u2019 trade deficit may seem unsustainably high, the global outsourcing system enables US corporates to lower their costs and, correspondingly, achieve higher profit margins.\n\nAn example is Apple, which enjoys a very high return on equity of more than 100 per cent. By outsourcing manufacturing, the company significantly reduces fixed asset investments while retaining the most lucrative parts of the product value chain: design and marketing.\n\nMoreover, China is Apple\u2019s second-largest market by revenue, which explains the US\u2019 subsequent move to exempt electronics products from tariffs. Focusing solely on the trade deficit also ignores the US\u2019 substantial services surplus, which includes software exports, movies and financial services.\n\nFrom an economic point of view, a current account deficit reflects a savings-investment shortfall, most evidently reflected in the US government\u2019s US$2 trillion fiscal deficit in 2024. Unwinding the trade deficit also requires the US to consume less, save more, pay higher prices and lower corporate profits and asset prices.\n\nThe sudden imposition of unprecedented tariffs raises questions about the country\u2019s commitment to global trade and commerce, which triggered a sell-off in both US Treasuries and the greenback.\n\nIts current account deficit is a key factor contributing to its unrivalled reserve currency status, granting it the exorbitant privilege of lower financing costs and consequently, stronger economic growth.\n\nInfluence of politics and geopolitics\n\nA key factor in escalation dominance is resilience, or the ability to endure the economic repercussions of a tit-for-tat escalation.\n\nIn this regard, while China will no doubt suffer the economic consequences of the amelioration of a US$438 billion export machinery, it has a political system that can withstand the pressure of a protracted stand-off.\n\nThe US, on the other hand, faces a mid-term election in 2026. A consumer fallout, whether due to inflation or rising unemployment, will no doubt have an impact on election outcomes, and could reverse the super-majority of the Republican Party.\n\nAdditionally, the US retains considerable influence in the geopolitical sphere given its military and technological dominance. A potential retaliation strategy could involve the US setting trade deals with other nations at China\u2019s expense.\n\nHowever, this will put many Asian countries in a dilemma, given the size of the Chinese market and its geographic proximity, against their dependency on the security umbrella of the US.\n\nA system in strain\n\nAll factors considered, the escalation dominance between the US and China may be more balanced than originally perceived. Given the symmetry of risk, a negotiated settlement would be the optimal outcome.\n\nThere are promising signs that the Apr 2 tariffs will be negotiated to less catastrophic levels. In our view, the current tariff-induced sell-off could see a recovery in the months ahead, especially bolstered by the market-friendly agenda of the current administration in areas of deregulation and tax cuts. The ongoing sell-off in the US Treasury market could also offer investors opportunities in the fixed income market.\n\nChina is likely to pursue more aggressive stimulus measures to mitigate the fallout from the current stalemate. Given the low exposure of major listed Chinese companies to international sales, a domestically driven stimulus could lead to a more sustained rally, compared with relying on export performance alone.\n\nIt is tempting to imagine this conflict ending with a deal or a handshake. But the more likely future is uneasy coexistence.\n\nThe US-China trade war is no longer about trade deficits or market access. It is about great power rivalries and which of their industrial models will define the future \u2013 the West favours rules-based capitalism; China champions state-led development. The clash is as much ideological as it is economic.\n\nThe challenge for both nations \u2013 and for the rest of the world \u2013 is to build new institutions that can manage rivalry without ruin and to reimagine a new development model ahead. For investors, this may usher in new sources of both opportunities and risks.\n\nThe writer is chief investment officer, UOB Private Bank\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/cd9591eac4b11c3e10462085c440b9b4a99d90456dc8a7354bd2d5349d992391?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "FILE PHOTO: Chinese and U.S. flags flutter outside the building of an American company in Beijing, China April 8, 2025.

In particular, Mandarin Gallery\u2019s committed occupancy inched up to 99.5 per cent \u2013 the highest since December 2019.\n\n\u201cManagement also took note of growing spending on food and beverage in comparison to shrinking luxury spending by Chinese tourists,\u201d the CGSI analysts said.\n\nOUE Reit\u2019s office portfolio saw positive rental reversion of 9.9 per cent in Q1, led by OUE Downtown and One Raffles Place; its retail segment at Mandarin Gallery posted positive rental reversion of 4.9 per cent.\n\nThe analysts noted that the Reit manager renewed 5 per cent out of the 18.6 per cent of expiring leases by gross rental income in FY2025.\n\n\u201cManagement expects reversion of single-digit positive reversion to hold up as expiring leases continue being marked to market,\u201d they added.\n\nHospitality headwinds?\n\nHowever, CGSI still sees uncertainty for OUE Reit\u2019s hospitality segment.\n\nFor Q1 FY2025, the Reit\u2019s hospitality revenue fell 13.3 per cent to S$23.3 million, while NPI slid 12.5 per cent to S$20.8 million.\n\nCGSI\u2019s analysts said the decline was mainly led by underperformance at Hilton Orchard, as the number of travellers from the US, Indonesia and China dropped.\n\nThey noted that revenue per available room (RevPAR) at Hilton Orchard was 19.1 per cent lower at S$249 in March, compared to the year before.\n\nThe decline was partially offset by a growing contribution from Crowne Plaza, which saw an 8.9 per cent growth in RevPAR to S$247.\n\n\u201cWe lowered our RevPAR assumptions for Hilton Singapore Orchard to factor in the impact of macroeconomic headwinds on travel demand, thus lowering our FY2025-2027 revenue forecasts by 3 to 4 per cent,\u201d said CGSI\u2019s Lock and Li.\n\nUnits of OUE Reit were down S$0.005, or 1.8 per cent, at S$0.275 on Tuesday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The weighted average lease expiry stood at 5.7 years at the end of Q1 2025 from 5.9 years at the end of Q4 2024, supported by new leases and no expiring leases during the quarter.\n\nAggregate leverage held steady at 37.7 per cent as at Mar 31, 2025, from 37.6 per cent as at Dec 31, 2024. This was due to the voluntary partial loan repayment of five million euros (S$7.5 million) in relation to the Spanish portfolio, offset by lower cash balance from the distribution payment and loan repayment.\n\nThe European real estate market has improved but the recent geopolitical developments and tempered investor interest may slow recovery in 2025.

PHOTO: BCA RESEARCH\n\nGLOBAL investors are rotating out of US assets not because of uncertainty over tariffs, says strategist Marko Papic of BCA Research, but because non-US assets are more attractive, particularly as the US dollar is expected to weaken over time.\n\nPapic wrote in a recent note: \u201cThe big picture is that the market narrative of US exceptionalism is dead. So, it doesn\u2019t really matter what happens with the trade war. President Trump has catalysed what was always going to happen, which is the rotation of capital away from extremely expensive US.\u201d\n\nHe maintains that the market story of 2025 is that \u201cglobal investors are using the catalyst and news flow of the trade war to lighten their exposure to US assets\u201d. \u201cThe trade war noise is providing cover for an absolute exodus out of the US.\u201d\n\nThis is evident in the year-to-date underperformance of Nasdaq and S&P 500 relative to the rest of the world. The Nasdaq is down by 10 per cent and S&P 500 by 6 per cent. In contrast, MSCI ACWI ex-US is up by more than 7 per cent; MSCI Europe by 3 per cent; China by more than 9 per cent; and Asia ex-Japan by 1 per cent.\n\nPapic is BCA Research chief strategist, whose analyses combine geopolitics and markets in a framework called  GeoMacro. He was in Singapore last week for a conference by the Investment Management Association of Singapore, where he was on the podium to share his views on \u201cextracting geopolitical alpha\u201d. He spoke to BT on the sidelines of the conference.\n\nUS dollar, assets to weaken\n\nThe US dollar is \u201cway too strong\u201d, he said, and could weaken by 30 to 50 per cent over the next five years. This would make US goods and services more attractive, and effectively rebalance trade for the US in a more \u201cgentlemanly\u201d fashion than tariffs.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\n\u201cAmericans will be able to say \u2013 look, we\u2019re more attractive. Investment and factories will naturally move (to the US). Everything that Trump wants to do via threats and aggression will happen in a gentlemanly way, because currency depreciation is an across-the-board gentleman\u2019s tariff. The reason that rivals and partners are not going to be mad is because it\u2019s not permanent. Currencies go up and down.\u201d\n\nHe expects the value of US assets to deflate over the next five years. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean the S&P 500 doesn\u2019t end the year positive; it may go up 7 or 10 per cent. But if the dollar declines by 7 per cent, in currency-adjusted returns, someone in Japan, Singapore or Europe would do better in other equity markets.\n\n\u201cMost investors, whether they\u2019re individuals or family offices or long-term pension funds, are up to their necks in US assets and US dollars\u2026 If you take some of the proceeds over the last five to 10 years and invest in foreign assets in a very diversified way, that will be the smartest thing to do over the next five years.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nTrump\u2019s baseline tariffs affect 55% of Singapore\u2019s exports \u2013 what about the rest?\n\nFor Trump, it\u2019s all going as planned\n\nTrump promised a markets boom; 100 days in, stocks have only seen damage\n\nSingapore\u2019s future role\n\nSingapore, he observed, is feeling \u201ca lot of consternation\u201d with the onslaught of tariffs and the trade war. But that consternation, he argued, is \u201cbuilt on two false narratives\u201d.\n\nThe first narrative is the belief that globalisation is ending. This, he argued, is not so. \u201cExports as a percentage of global GDP have been stable at 30 per cent for the past seven years. That\u2019s not going away. Trump\u2019s actions are causing other countries to start redoubling on globalisation. Singapore will be fine.\u201d\n\nThe second is that Singapore has traditionally played the role of helping to \u201cgrease the wheels of US-China cooperation\u201d. But Singapore, he said, should position itself as the \u201cfinancial capital of a multi-polar world\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s where Singapore\u2019s long-term relationship with the US could be a detriment. Singapore may have to take a stand, or take no stand.\u201d\n\nHe believes the future lies in facilitating capital in a \u201cnon-aligned Global South\u201d, and \u201cwhoever gets there faster wins\u201d. He sees other financial centres competing for leadership in this, including India, Abu Dhabi and Hong Kong. The Global South refers to countries mainly in Asia, Africa and Latin America. \u201cThe next 30 years are going to be about South to South\u2026 not so much goods but capital flows and savings. I think that\u2019s where Singapore\u2019s future is.\u201d\n\nIn his GeoMacro reports, Papic has written on what he sees as an exodus out of US assets, as well as over-valuation and false narratives by Big Tech companies. One of the drivers of the funds outflow is the realisation that the \u201cfiscal gravy train\u201d is slowing. Until recently the US stock market, especially tech stocks, has been buoyed by expectations of a generous fiscal package under Trump.\n\nBut Trump, he wrote, will increasingly face the \u201ctightening noose of material constraints\u201d. One constraint is the US bond market, which has not rallied as much given the rising odds of a recession. If bond yields remain elevated, then Trump may not be able to follow through with expected tax cuts, as fiscal spending may be opposed by conservatives in the House.\n\n\u201cThe material constraints against Trump are coming fast and hard. Bond yields are too high, fiscal conservatives in the House are revolting and negotiating trade with the entire world at the same time seems folly.\u201d\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The commercial component is capped at 4,306 square feet gross floor area.\n\nThis is the first government land sales (GLS) site tender closing since the US announced import tariff hikes, noted Tricia Song, CBRE\u2019s head of research for Singapore and South-east Asia.\n\nAnalysts polled by\n\nThe Business Times\n\nhad predicted zero to four bids for the site, with the highest bid projected to be in the S$925 to S$1,150 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr) range. The plot is not near an MRT station nor amenities such as schools, large retail malls, hawker centres and coffee shops that would appeal to local owner-occupier buyers of private homes, said Song.\n\n\u201cThere is also a lack of HDB upgraders in the locality,\u201d she pointed out.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nTuesday, 12 pm\n\nProperty Insights\n\nGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nDevelopers were likely also discouraged by the lacklustre launch performance this month at the nearby Bloomsbury Residences project, with 90 units, or 25 per cent of the total 358 units, sold at an average price of S$2,474 psf. \u201c(This contrasts) with an average sell-through rate of 58 per cent for major launches since September 2024 when interest rate cuts first started,\u201d Song noted.\n\nBloomsbury Residences is being developed by a consortium led by Qingjian Realty and Forsea Residence (a unit of China Communications Construction Company). The tie-up paid about S$1,191 psf ppr for the site at a state tender in early 2024 which drew three bids.\n\nSupply in area\n\nBesides the unsold units at Bloomsbury Residences, a further source of supply in the locale will be an estimated 325 private housing units expected from the development of Media Circle (Parcel A), awarded in March to another Qingjian-Forsea-led partnership, which bid S$1,036.64 psf ppr for the site. That tender also drew three bids.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nQingjian Realty, China Communications Construction defend turf in one-north\n\nLakeside Drive, Dunearn Road, Woodlands residential sites released for sale\n\nKingsford is top bidder for Lentor Gardens private housing site, at S$920 psf ppr\n\nFurther supply could be on the way in the Media Circle area.\n\nA long-stay serviced apartment site that was not awarded last year is now on the reserve list of the current first-half 2025 GLS programme. The site may be triggered for sale or it could feature in future GLS programmes, with or without the long-stay serviced apartment requirements, potentially adding even more homes in this location, said OrangeTee & Tie chief executive officer Justin Quek.\n\nMany property consultants also attributed the absence of bids for Media Circle (Parcel B) to developers\u2019 strategy of keeping some powder dry to bid for more choice sites on the confirmed list of the H1 2025 GLS programme.\n\n\u201cThese include plots in new housing precincts in Bukit Timah Turf City and the former Keppel Golf Course site \u2013 in Dunearn Road and Telok Blangah Road, respectively \u2013 plots in Chuan Grove, Lakeside Drive, and a mixed-use site in Hougang Central, all of which are close to an MRT station,\u201d said Wong Siew Ying, PropNex head of research and content.\n\nMogul.sg chief research officer Nicholas Mak noted that developers will be more selective and cautious with land acquisition. \u201cThey are recalibrating their strategy in light of expected slower Singapore economic growth and greater uncertainty on the back of trade tensions sparked by higher tariffs imposed by the US.\u201d\n\nThe last time there were no takers for a site at a URA tender was in June 2024, for Upper Thomson Road (Parcel A), which included a mandatory long-stay serviced apartment component.\n\nThe plot is now on the confirmed list of the H1 2025 GLS programme; however, serviced apartment or long-stay serviced apartment use is not mandated, but can be allowed subject to approval from technical agencies.\n\n(The long-stay serviced apartment concept, unveiled in November 2023, entails a three-month minimum stay requirement vis-a-vis seven days for regular serviced apartments.)\n\nThe one-north research hub and business centre, master-planned by JTC, focuses on knowledge-intensive activities in growth sectors such as the biomedical, info-communications and media industries.\n\nThe URA has envisaged Media Circle (Parcel B) as a way to inject vibrancy into the estate and bring homes closer to the workplaces and education institutions within one-north.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWhat's moving the markets?

PHOTO: AFP\n\nFOR close to four decades, the diplomatic and national security agendas of the Republican Party were dominated by a group of policy intellectuals \u2013 aka the neoconservatives \u2013 who promoted the notion that the US should seek to achieve geostrategic primacy, and to export its democratic and liberal values worldwide.\n\nThe so-called \u201cneocons\u201d were at the peak of their power during the administration of President George W Bush, who had embraced their foreign policy ideas, including their plans to establish American military hegemony in the Middle East and to remake the region along liberal-democratic lines.\n\nThese policies led to the disastrous and costly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that harmed US global interests, and created a political backlash at home against new American military interventions abroad. Those sentiments were eventually highlighted by presidential candidate Donald Trump in 2015.\n\nIndeed, Trumpism in its essence became antithetical to the neoconservative agenda, vowing to bring an end to American military interventions, and rejecting the view that the US had an obligation to promote human rights and democracy around the world.\n\nInstead, the Maga (Make America Great Again) movement has espoused a nationalist-isolationist agenda that stressed the need to defend core military and economic interests, as opposed to making the world safe for democracy.\n\nFrom that perspective, there was no place in the second Trump administration for two ardent neocons \u2013 former secretary of state Mike Pompeo and former US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nInstead, Trump has surrounded himself with a group of policy intellectuals \u2013 call them \u201cneo-isolationists\u201d \u2013 who share his foreign policy instincts of resisting foreign policy interventions and global ideological crusades.\n\nLeading this group of neo-isolationists is Vice-President JD Vance, a veteran of the Iraq War, who has insisted that the military adventures promoted by the neocons ran contrary to US interests and should not be continued.\n\nIn addition to rallying against new military interventions, Vance has argued that the time has come for US allies across the Atlantic to translate their economic power into military might, and to defend their strategic interests as opposed to continuing relying on the US to do that for them.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nGOP nat-cons versus globalists: The populist insurgents have won\n\nIn that context, Vance, like his boss, has insisted that the Europeans should be the ones supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia that is in their strategic backyard.\n\nAccording to this view, defending Ukraine is not a core US interest, and the Americans should disengage from the war there, improve their relationship with Russia, and focus their economic and military resources on their primary goal \u2013 which is to contain its major geostrategic and geoeconomic adversary, China.\n\nTwo other prominent neo-isolationists in the administration are Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, and Elbridge Colby, undersecretary of defence for policy, both of whom have been long-time critics of the Iraq War and forceful opponents of the US support for Ukraine.\n\nColby and Gabbard have also said in the past that denying Iran the acquisition of nuclear weapons is not a core US interest, and have advocated reaching a diplomatic deal with the Islamic Republic. Colby has refrained from committing the US to come to Taiwan\u2019s aid in a war with China.\n\nHence, contrary to the conventional wisdom, Trump\u2019s foreign policy is not ad hocish. It is grounded in the foreign policy doctrine of isolationism espoused by his aides.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was thanks to contributions from eight new stores opening in the quarter and FY2024, as well as higher festive sales during Hari Raya in March, said the company in a business update on Tuesday (Apr 29).\n\nGross profit consequently rose to S$122 million in Q1, a 10.2 per cent increase from the S$110.7 million posted the year prior.\n\nEarnings per share stood at S$0.0257, up 6.2 per cent from S$0.0242 in the year-ago period.\n\nThe improved performance came despite operating costs rising 12.4 per cent to S$81.6 million. This was mainly due to an 8.8 per cent year-on-year increase in administrative expenses to S$15.8 million, and a 13.3 per cent rise in selling and distribution expenses to S$65.8 million.\n\nSheng Siong attributed these to higher staff costs from higher variable bonuses, which was in turn from a better financial performance, enhanced employment benefits and more employees hired for the new stores.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nCash flow from operating activities fell by S$10.1 million, from more payments being made to banks and vendors during the quarter.

These include major exports such as semiconductors; other electronics and semiconductor equipment; pharmaceuticals; and energy, copper, lumber and minerals.\n\nBut this might change, warned the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) on Monday (Apr 28) in its twice-yearly\n\nMacroeconomic Report\n\n, where it gave the breakdown of these exports.\n\nMAS noted that the US administration has begun trade probes into its imports of these goods, on national security concerns, and could impose restrictions in the coming months.\n\nThe US is Singapore\u2019s second-largest export market, accounting for 11 per cent of Singapore\u2019s domestic exports in 2024.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nOn Apr 2, the US imposed a baseline 10 per cent tariff on all imports, as well as higher rates for certain countries.\n\nA 90-day suspension of the higher-band tariffs was later announced for all trading partners except China. But the baseline tariff remains, along with a 25 per cent tariff on steel and aluminium, as well as automobiles and parts.\n\nDirect and indirect impacts\n\nIn its report on Monday, MAS compared the increased global tariff rate to a \u201cproduction tax\u201d on Singapore\u2019s producers and exporters.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nSingapore\u2019s growth outlook turns more cautious as US tariffs deliver \u2018negative shock\u2019: MAS\n\nSingapore\u2019s March exports ease, missing analysts\u2019 expectations; forecast tipped for downgrade\n\nThe tariffs squeeze export margins, prompting companies to reduce production. This means less demand for factors of production, and may constrain aggregate demand in the economy.\n\nBesides the direct impact of tariffs, Singapore is also affected via trade links with other tariff-hit countries \u2013 including China, its largest export market.\n\nSingapore exports intermediate goods and services to China, which are then used in the latter\u2019s exports to the US. If China\u2019s exports to the US fall due to tariffs, so will demand for Singapore\u2019s exports to China.\n\nThese indirect effects may also occur through other regional economies such as Asean, given Singapore\u2019s role as a hub for production and trading supply chains, said MAS.\n\nBeyond that, tariff uncertainty could cause a broader pullback in global consumption and investment spending, which will also hurt Singapore\u2019s growth.\n\nFirms are likely to hold back on investments, while households may reduce spending to buffer against possible income shocks.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Economy & Policy\n\nEconomists upgrade 2025 outlook after\u00a0\nQ2 GDP turns out better than expected\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:02 PM\n\nSingapore GDP up 4.3% in Q2, well above market expectations amid US tariff pause\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:00 AM\n\nSingapore sets up centre to advance sustainable aviation in Apac\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:00 PM\n\nGraduates should \u2018stay calm\u2019, with early data showing better employment rates: Tan See Leng\n\nJul 10, 2025 02:07 PM\n\nDPM Gan to visit US for trade talks; new grant of up to S$100,000 for tariff-hit businesses\n\nJul 10, 2025 02:00 PM\n\nSingapore has the opportunity to become a global hub for advanced chip packaging: study\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:35 PM\n\nNo money, manpower or time to train workers?

The so-called \u2018Trump Gold Card\u2019 offers residency and a path to citizenship to investors who pay US$5 million to the US treasury. US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick has claimed the government sold over 1,000 visas on a single day in March.\n\nMalta\u2019s investor citizenship programme, meanwhile, has allowed individuals to obtain citizenship so they can live and work there, with a minimum donation of 600,000 euros (S$894,124). The required investments also include buying a house, and voluntary donations are encouraged. As an EU nation, Maltese passports grant holders the freedom to live and work anywhere inside the 27-member bloc.\n\nThe Mediterranean island is one of a handful of European countries that have over recent years offered golden visas and passports, which gained popularity during the European debt crisis when nations started selling residency to attract foreign investment.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nTrump to offer \u2018gold card\u2019 visas for US$5 million to the rich\n\nNew Zealand weighs whether to relax foreign homebuyer ban\n\nNew Zealand locks out foreign home buyers even as golden visa rules eased\n\nNew Zealand changes \u2018golden visa\u2019 to lure wealthy migrants\n\nSingle women, rich millennials will fuel luxury real estate this year\n\nSingapore\u2019s new family office framework will give clarity, but may not be enough to attract more super rich\n\nThe world\u2019s super rich are moving to Dubai, but keeping their assets in Singapore, Switzerland\n\nTrump unveils first US$5 million \u2018gold card\u2019 visa\n\nMore\n\nPortugal, Ireland, Greece, Hungary had in recent years also launched such programmes for the wealthy to get their hands on much-prized EU freedom of movement. But the offerings caused uproar from the European Commission \u2013 the bloc\u2019s executive arm \u2013 which claimed cash-for-citizenship policies expose the EU to money laundering and security risks.\n\nIn September 2022, the Brussels-based authority filed a legal challenge against Malta\u2019s programme, claiming that \u201cgranting EU citizenship in return for pre-determined payments\u201d is \u201cnot compatible with the principle of sincere cooperation enshrined\u201d in the bloc\u2019s rules.\n\nTuesday\u2019s judgment is at odds with the non-binding opinion of an adviser to the EU tribunal, who said last year that it was for EU countries themselves to \u201cdetermine who is entitled to be one of their nationals and, as a consequence, who is an EU citizen.\u201d BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWhat's moving the markets?

So what happens when we reclaim it and use it for reflection.\u201d\n\nZul Mahmod\u2019s sculpture picks up surrounding electromagnetic frequencies and turns them into sounds resembling wartime radio transmissions. PHOTO: FINBARR FALLON\n\nSeven Singapore-based artists were invited to respond to different parts of the Battlebox, with site-specific works that look like they\u2019ve been beamed in from the future but are haunted by the past.\n\nTake sound artist Zul Mahmod\u2019s\n\nElectromagnetic Sound: The Hidden Echoes\n\n. Tucked into what was once the generator room, his sculpture picks up surrounding electromagnetic frequencies and spits them back out as static \u2013 a ghostly hiss that suggests the room still remembers every military order and Morse-coded SOS.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nFriday, 2 pm\n\nLifestyle\n\nOur picks of the latest dining, travel and leisure options to treat yourself.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nVictoria Hertel\u2019s\n\ndarkmode\n\n, meanwhile, is pure sensory poetry. A series of hand-blown glass vessels dangle in the dark, lighting up and vibrating in response to your movement. \u201cShe wanted to show how technology can sense presence even in total darkness,\u201d says Shireen. \u201cThere\u2019s something tender here, but also strange \u2013 like the space is alive and trying to communicate with you.\u201d\n\nAnthony Chin\u2019s installation reflects on the opium trade\u2019s devastating legacy \u2013 tracing its entanglement with colonial power, addiction and exploitation. PHOTO: FINBARR FALLON\n\nAnthony Chin\u2019s piece is anything but tender. In\n\nBMA\n\n, a motorised hook tugs repeatedly at a stretched latex screen projecting colonial imagery: Lord Louis Mountbatten\u2019s limp arm, Chinese coolies, opium dens. The tension is literal \u2013 the screen strains with every pull, never quite breaking. \u201cIt\u2019s about how colonial power never really lets go,\u201d says Shireen. \u201cIt\u2019s about profit, addiction, exploitation \u2013 all under the guise of liberation.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s Jake Tan\u2019s\n\nIn Flux\n\n, a piece straight out of a dystopian sci-fi film. Using robotics-grade depth cameras, the artwork tracks visitors and projects ghostly silhouettes across rooms, allowing you to spy on yourself and others in real time. Not only that, he adds a spectral dimension to the installation \u2013 suggesting that the soldiers that once manned this underground bunker have not quite left.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nHow one man made nude art possible in Singapore\n\nThis Malaysian actor is scoring the best Singapore roles\n\nJake Tan\u2019s installation detects and projects human presence on the wall \u2013 but also adds a spectral dimension that suggests the dead are not quite dead. PHOTO: FINBARR FALLON\n\nOn the other side of the wall, Chen Dongyan\u2019s artworks are quieter but no less eerie. She transforms the old bunker bar into a kind of Morse-code DJ booth. As you speak or move, projections dance across the walls, translating your presence into pulsing visuals. \u201cIt listens to you,\u201d says Shireen. \u201cLike a bartender who watches and remembers everything.\u201d\n\nBefore creating the works, the seven artists \u2013 who also include Ernest Wu and Lu Huijun \u2013 explored the site with a historian, picking up on fragments of forgotten narratives. For instance, when the Battlebox was first rediscovered in the 1980s, it was filled with rainwater and the bones of a dog trapped inside.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this symbolic transfer of power that\u2019s happened,\u201d says Liu. \u201cFrom the British to the Japanese, back to the British \u2013 and now, to the artists.\u201d The show\u2019s underlying thesis is that technology \u2013 once the domain of war rooms and surveillance \u2013 can now be used to provoke introspection, and stir curiosity.\n\nThe Battlebox has always been a place of secrets. Now, it glows with strange new truths and conversations.\n\nCurator-led tours, artist talks, and hands-on workshops are happening from now to June.

But just a week later, he took a surprising turn, announcing a 90-day suspension of all reciprocal tariffs and reducing most rates to 10 per cent.\n\nThe exception is notably China, where the tariff rate was kept at a staggering 145 per cent. By Apr 11, China had hit back, slapping an equally hefty 125 per cent tariff on US goods. This back-and-forth has sparked fears of a full-blown trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\n\nCurrently, the US is considering scaling back its tariffs on China to ease tensions. China, on the other hand, has offered some relief by exempting certain US imports. Despite the minor de-escalation, the situation remains volatile and unpredictable, with both nations locked in a stand-off.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Wealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nDollar-selling is becoming a bubble, which may burst, HSBC says\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nSingapore shares hit new high; STI up 0.5%", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/02c720a2399079b6ffd7c6d6fd396309de29bf2eb4ec5b462b3a5d347f86396c?w=180&h=120&dpr=1&f=webp", "alt_text": "SGX hopes to act as a bridge between regulated financial markets and the freewheeling world of cryptocurrency trading."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/4289d8d339d2fdfa007a69ca3f71e6561f37487addf969c7255ef03bcc2cbd42?w=180&h=120&dpr=1&f=webp", "alt_text": "CS Fresh is operated by mainboard-listed DFI Retail Group.

Virgin Atlantic also said it had seen a slowdown in travel to Britain from the US.\n\nAir France-KLM, which reports first-quarter results on Wednesday, earlier this month said that it would consider cutting economy fares in an effort to support potentially lagging transatlantic travel.\n\nThe transatlantic route is key for global airlines, maintaining some of the highest revenue and demand and helping airlines like IAG-owned British Airways maintain solid results.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nLufthansa said demand in the US sales region was continuing to rise. In March, the airlines group carried around 25% more passengers from the US to Europe.\n\nStill, the company said it has set up \u201ca task force to closely monitor current developments and, if necessary, respond quickly and flexibly to any weakening in demand, for example by adjusting capacity.\u201d\n\nLufthansa is counting on the lucrative route as it faces pressure to revive its core airline, bogged down by wage talks and high pay, and find new sources of revenue as it struggles to compete with Chinese carriers in Asia.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nLufthansa 2024 profits dive amid strikes, rising costs\n\n\u201cMacroeconomic uncertainties, particularly the trade tensions between the US, the EU and other regions, are making it difficult to forecast the coming quarters accurately,\u201d the German flag carrier said in a statement.\n\nFor the first three months of 2025, Lufthansa reported an adjusted loss before interest and taxes (EBIT) of 722 million euros (S$1.07 billion), roughly in line with a company-compiled forecast.\n\nThat\u2019s down 15% from a loss of 849 million euros for the same quarter last year. Revenues were up 10% on last year, at 8.1 billion euros, compared with 7.3 billion euros.\n\nLufthansa shares are around the same level as this time last year, with one trader saying there could be a bounce today based on what they see as \u201cgood enough\u201d results.

This could include adding renewable projects, such as solar parks, the chief executive officer said.\n\nThe fund is today invested in a handful of onshore and offshore wind projects, as well as solar, in Europe, with a value of about 25.3 billion kroner (S$3.2 billion).\n\nIt made its first investment in 2021, when such investments were \u201cvery expensive, low yield, a lot of competition to get in because everybody was trying to make their portfolio a bit greener,\u201d Tangen said. \u201cSo we did very little.\u201d The situation is now \u201cvery different,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not particularly in favour, the potential returns are coming up, there is less competition and so we can make real investments here at good returns,\u201d he noted, \u201cin Europe and potentially in the US.\u201d\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nWhen it comes to real estate, NBIM already owns about 25 per cent of Regent Street in London and has big holdings in Manhattan, Tangen explained. \u201cRelative to the stock market, these things start to get be pretty attractive,\u201d Tangen said, adding the fund prefers prime properties. \u201cYou had kind of a perfect storm with everything from Covid to working from home, to regional bank uncertainty and so on, in the US.\u201d\n\nThe executive has sought to boost the profile of the fund at home and abroad, in part because he says that Norwegians should understand how their money is being invested. This includes hosting an annual investment conference in Oslo, with this year\u2019s guest-list featuring CEOs like Goldman Sachs Group\u2019s David Solomon, Ferrari\u2019s Benedetto Vigna and Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen of Novo Nordisk.\n\nNBIM is the world\u2019s biggest single owner of public equities, with shares in over 8,600 companies globally. It was established in the 1990s to invest Norway\u2019s oil riches and is largely an index-tracker, working according to a strict mandate from the country\u2019s Finance Ministry.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nNorway US$1.7 trillion wealth fund reports tech-stock driven loss\n\nThe fund last week reported its biggest loss since the third quarter of 2023 in what was a turbulent period for markets globally. The decline was largely caused by a drop in the value of technology companies, it noted.\n\n\u201cWe think that if you have a proper fragmentation of the world, there could be 35 per cent to 40 per cent downside in markets,\u201d Tangen said.

PHOTO: AFP\n\n[NEW YORK] Some Chinese exporters are speeding up the conversion of their US dollar income into yuan on bets the worst of the tariff-led loss in the local currency may be over.\n\nIn a Bloomberg survey of 18 Chinese exporters this month, all of them said they\u2019d already converted, or will immediately switch, their greenback holdings into the yuan, as they see the current yuan exchange rate of around 7.3 per US dollar as favourable.\n\nThe companies in sectors ranging from furniture, ceramics, decorative lighting, and gardening to garments were interviewed at the Canton Fair in Guangdong province earlier this month. They had an annual export revenue ranging from US$10 million to US$300 million.\n\nExporters\u2019 move to switch out of the greenback is in contrast to their strategy since late last year of hoarding US dollars on concern that US tariffs on China will weaken the yuan. Those bearish yuan wagers may have already played out as the currency fell to the weakest level since 2023 following Washington\u2019s move to impose tariffs of as much as 145 per cent on Chinese goods this month.\n\n\u201cThe yuan is unlikely to fall much further as 145 per cent US tariffs is the worst thing, nothing will be worse than this,\u201d said Albert Zhai, chairman of Aroma International Trade, an exporter of Halloween decorations, based in China\u2019s northern province of Liaoning.\n\nYuan fluctuating around 7.25 to 7.35 per US dollar is beneficial for the company\u2019s cross-border trade, Zhai said.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThe onshore yuan has clawed back some of its losses this month as doubts over US exceptionalism pummelled the US dollar. The yuan rose by as much as 0.2 per cent in both the onshore and offshore markets to around 7.27 on Tuesday (Apr 29), the strongest since early April.\n\nStill, the yuan remains the third worst-performing currency in Asia this year behind Indonesia\u2019s rupiah and the Hong Kong dollar. It\u2019s also near a 21-month low against a basket of its trading partners\u2019 currencies.\n\nYuan weakness is providing an opportunity for exporters that were holding out of converting their US dollar proceeds to finally act. The cash could come in handy at a time when higher tariffs skim margins, thereby raising the demand for funds to purchase raw materials and pay salaries.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nChina vows to stand firm, urges nations to resist \u2018bully\u2019 Trump\n\nChina claims no need for US grain as Brazil supplies grow\n\nChina vows steps to ease exporters\u2019 pain as Trump\u2019s tariffs hit\n\nChina says on \u2018right side of history\u2019 in trade standoff with US\n\nChina repeats vow to support jobs, economy as US tariffs hit\n\nMore\n\n\u201cChinese exporters may intend to reduce FX exposure given the low visibility of FX trends, shifting away from FX hoarding in the prior year,\u201d Ken Cheung, chief Asian foreign-exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank wrote in a note.\n\nThe exporters surveyed said the People\u2019s Bank of China will not allow the yuan to weaken too much.

He\u2019s my deputy.\u201d\n\nDPM Gan had decided not to run in the CEC elections in order to allow for renewal of the party, he added.\n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s still a key member of my Cabinet, of my team in government, and hopefully in the next Cabinet \u2013 anchoring, shouldering key responsibilities which are so critical during this period.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nGE2025: \u2018A ridiculous argument\u2019 that losing ministers will not weaken government, says SM Lee in Aljunied GRC\n\nGE2025: If boundaries change, \u2018there may be no next time\u2019 to vote for promising WP slate: Sylvia Lim\n\nGE2025: Losing three, four ministers would weaken both the government and Singapore, says PM Wong\n\nPM Wong said the comparison with former DPM Heng was not relevant, because the latter\u2019s health issues were a factor in his decision to step down.\n\nAt the same doorstop interview, DPM Gan also clarified his role in the controversial\n\nIncome-Allianz deal\n\n. He said that when the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) saw the proposal in July, the focus was the main transfer of ownership in Income.\n\nHis clarification follows WP candidate Harpreet Singh\u2019s call to respond to an open letter by former NTUC Income chief Tan Suee Chieh. In the open letter, Tan had questioned DPM Gan\u2019s role in the deal as chairman of MAS.\n\nDPM Gan said that the S$2.2 billion stake sale was the key transaction for which MAS had to ensure that liquidity and capital adequacy requirements were met.\n\nIf Allianz wanted to withdraw capital from Income subsequently, there are \u201csteps and processes in place\u201d to ensure Income still has adequate capital to meet all of MAS\u2019 requirements, he added.\n\nNoting that the WP \u201chad all the opportunities\u201d to raise questions about the deal in Parliament, he added: \u201cI\u2019m surprised that they reiterate these questions.\u201d\n\nPM Wong reiterated that the government had stopped the deal, with DPM Gan playing an important role.\n\nSaid PM Wong: \u201cTan Suee Chieh himself credits me and the government for doing it. But actually he shouldn\u2019t be crediting me, he should be crediting Gan Kim Yong and MAS.\u201d\n\nFor more election coverage, visit our\n\nGE2025 microsite\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Singapore\n\nSingapore boosts support for Timor-Leste as it prepares to join Asean\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:36 PM\n\nEconomists upgrade 2025 outlook after\u00a0\nQ2 GDP turns out better than expected\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:02 PM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nDaily Debrief: What Happened Today (Jul 14)\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:30 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nSingapore GDP up 4.3% in Q2, well above market expectations amid US tariff pause\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:00 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/92f265e64bd97daa447d8dbd839ca3f5c0f84ab974cb7be60e005b15ebd39a51?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/18f9c0545120f67cccc4cb5e1f2b0cf11892838e6d9e6ef93eebccf6f2dfdef8?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": null, "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/4ea37db5461e231f31d72a43ab9b4bbb416b78332f35bc99c07c3dcf8841ce29?w=180&h=120&dpr=1&f=webp", "alt_text": "Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong and the PAP Aljunied GRC candidates at 630 Bedok Reservoir Road Market and Food Centre on Apr 29."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/13f2be2e6552476559a546e600999efdcdbb1c4bc37ab7ac5aa7aaae37e5d45e?w=180&h=120&dpr=1&f=webp", "alt_text": "Workers' Party chair Sylvia Lim called the WP's slate of GE2025 candidates the \"most promising\" the party has fielded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/ef9d9fe2dc021d90f71e06e3b159f759108de5cfc1b726d22a8b987f631deb41?w=180&h=120&dpr=1&f=webp", "alt_text": "A vote for the opposition is not a \u201cfree vote for more alternative voices\u201d, said PM Wong at Monday's rally."}]}

DPM Gan is anchoring the PAP team there against a WP team.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t very well say that Gan Kim Yong is a very valuable minister but nevertheless, \u2018Please vote for me\u2019, so he has to say that,\u201d said SM Lee.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nGE2025: If boundaries change, \u2018there may be no next time\u2019 to vote for promising WP slate: Sylvia Lim\n\nGE2025: SM Teo Chee Hean reiterates importance of continuity amid uncertainty\n\nGE2025: PAP will provide support for Singaporeans for as long as necessary, says Indranee\n\nGE2025: What is the Fullerton rally?\n\nGE2025: Losing three, four ministers would weaken both the government and Singapore, says PM Wong\n\nGE2025: Reject racial, religious identity politics, uphold multiracial unity, says SM Lee\n\nMore\n\nOn Singh\u2019s argument that amenities such as hospitals and train stations will continue to be built if the opposition is elected, SM Lee said basic facilities and government services are developed across the island.\n\n\u201cBut does the MP in a constituency make a difference? The answer is yes,\u201d he said.\n\nThe PAP candidates in Aljunied GRC will have their residents\u2019 interests at heart and will be able to work with the government to help make sure it understands these concerns and needs, he added.\n\nAsked about the WP\u2019s charge that the ruling party had not put out a five-year plan for Aljunied GRC, SM Lee said that was \u201crich\u201d, as WP chairwoman Sylvia Lim had also said the opposition party has no five-year plans for the new constituencies they are contesting.\n\nChan Hui Yuh, who is leading the PAP team in Aljunied GRC, said the candidates will rejuvenate the towns and make them more livable if elected.\n\nSM Lee said: \u201c(For) the PAP, if you want to know what our plans are, look around you.

Consumers and businesses have become more cautious as Trump\u2019s global trade war roils financial markets and raises fears of a sharp worldwide economic downturn.\n\nElhedery said the lender\u2019s Mexico business would likely see some disruption but remained a \u201ccritical node\u201d in its global trading network.\n\nA Reuters poll showed Mexico\u2019s economy, which stood on the brink of a technical recession last quarter, will barely grow at all this year.\n\nAnalysts at Jefferies described the earnings as strong, noting higher activity in Asia and specifically Hong Kong wealth, which posted 29 per cent growth in new customers quarter-on-quarter.\n\nRichard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said, the increasing focus on \u201cthe growth in affluent wealth, especially in Asia, is key to the new offering\u201d.\n\n\u201cEarly signs of success are evident from US$22 billion of new invested assets in the quarter, US$16 billion of which emanated from Asia,\u201d he said.\n\nTargets unchanged, overhaul continues\n\nElhedery, a career HSBC insider promoted from the CFO role, has shaken up the bank since assuming the top role six months ago by slashing the ranks of senior managers and reorganising operating divisions along East-West lines.\n\nThat restructuring is continuing, with the bank on track to deliver US$1.5 billion of annual savings by end-2026, equivalent to around 8 per cent of total staff costs.\n\nIt expects to incur severance and other upfront costs of US$1.8 billion over 2025 and 2026, in line with earlier estimates.\n\nDespite the gloomier economic outlook, HSBC left unchanged its performance target of a mid-teens return on average tangible equity for each of the three years from 2025 to 2027, having hit 14.6 per cent in 2024.\n\nHowever, the bank said its stake in Bank of Communications (Bocom) will drop to about 16 per cent from 19.03 per cent, and it will book a loss of up to US$1.6 billion as a result of the Chinese bank\u2019s fundraising by private placement of shares.\n\nHSBC said it has also launched a strategic review of its Malta operations, which is still \u201cat an early stage.\u201d\n\nElhedery praised the UK government for measures aimed at supporting domestic growth but said crisis-era rules to insulate retail operations from higher-risk banking activities trapped liquidity, stifled competition and were now \u201credundant\u201d.\n\nTogether with CEOs from NatWest, Santander UK and Lloyds, Elhedery co-signed a letter to British Finance Minister Rachel Reeves last week, calling for reform to improve the flow of capital to businesses.\n\nHSBC will pay an interim dividend of US$0.10 a share, following a US$0.87 dividend payout last year.

PHOTO: AFP\n\nFIFTY years ago this week, a collective shudder rippled through South-east Asia. On Apr 30, 1975, Saigon as it was known then, fell to the North Vietnamese Army and their local supporters, shattering long-held assumptions about the geopolitical order in this part of the world. Even so, most regional leaders remained sangfroid. Others were unnerved and told their children to consider leaving for safety.\n\nThe ruling elites in Washington and many in this region had swallowed the so-called Domino Theory hook, line and sinker. It was Washington\u2019s overarching rationale for getting involved in what was essentially a local anti-colonial uprising. Worse, the theory, such as it was, had been based on a toddler\u2019s understanding of how to play the game: set up domino tiles upright, all in a row, and knock down the last one and watch all the others topple in succession. Such fun \u2013 if you are a two-year-old. Suffice it to say, the adult version of dominoes required somewhat more intellectual horsepower and would not have yielded such a silly analogy.\n\nIn the event, rather than the rest of South-east Asia falling under the sway of communism one by one, as theory predicted, Vietnam eventually joined Asean. Nor was there anything resembling the widely predicted bloodbath after the South Vietnam\u2019s ruling generals fled. As Associated Press reporter George Esper, who remained behind to continue his work, noted at that time: \u201cThe official line from the United States government in the waning days was that there would be a bloodbath. I saw no bloodbath.\u201d\n\nThis is not to say there was no aftermath. The legacy of Agent Orange remains a blight on the people of southern Vietnam. It has been estimated that between 1962 and 1971, US forces sprayed about 41.3 million litres of this toxic defoliant over forests and farms. Dioxin, the most toxic component of Agent Orange, found its way into the food and drinking water sources. Its molecular stability allowed it to accumulate in soil and water. This subsequently contaminated entire food chains and damaged the DNA of thousands of species.\n\nIn humans, it triggered severe health effects and thousands of children were born with congenital deformities, such as spina bifida and cleft palate, a result of the chemical\u2019s interference with the basic genetic code. Some of these deformed children survived and have been featured in recent documentaries. No one was ever held responsible for this atrocity.\n\nAmerica too was wounded. George Bush Senior spoke of the country\u2019s loss of self-confidence. Nothing would wash away the televisual reminders of the American ambassador departing by helicopter from the rooftop of the embassy. Far worse, thousands of young men returned broken in spirit and addicted to narcotics.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nPhilippines says China has not seized disputed South China Sea reef\n\nMohamed Heikal, then editor of Egypt\u2019s premier newspaper\n\nAl Ahram\n\n, in his biography of Nasser, quotes Chinese leader Zhao Enlai as saying: \u201cDo you remember when the West imposed opium on us? They fought us with opium \u2026 We are going to use their own methods against them. We want them to have a big army in Vietnam which is hostage to us, and we want to demoralise them. The effect this demoralisation is going to have on the United States will be far greater than anyone realises.\u201d\n\nAs ever in wars, the powerless and poor paid the price.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It took the annual rate to 2.6 per cent, the most in 11 months.\n\nThe hikes pile further pressure on households and underscore the inflation risks still facing Bank of England (BOE) policymakers. While there were offsetting monthly declines in non-food prices, overall shop deflation moderated to just 0.1 per cent, the BRC said.\n\nWith hundreds of thousands of employees in the UK, supermarkets are among the sectors hardest hit by the measures announced in the Labour government\u2019s first budget in October. They included a 6.7 per cent rise in the minimum wage and a \u00a326 billion (S$45.6 billion) increase in payroll taxes, both of which took effect this month.\n\nThe survey findings may reinforce caution at the BOE over how quickly to cut interest rates, with many retailers choosing to raise prices rather than absorb the extra costs.\n\nWhile the central bank is expected to deliver more rate cuts this year, some officials have warned that rising bills could feed wage demands, given that Britons may be more sensitive to inflation after the cost-of-living crisis. Research suggests that food prices are particularly pertinent for consumers and their inflation expectations.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\n\u201cThe days of shop price deflation look numbered,\u201d BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said. \u201cDespite price competition heating up, retailers are unable to absorb the total impact of these \u00a35 billion of employment costs and the additional \u00a32 billion costs when the new packaging tax comes into effect in October.\u201d\n\nBusinesses have also warned of job cuts to protect their margins.\n\nThe pickup in grocery prices comes amid a barrage of other annual cost increases for households in April, from council tax to regulated prices such as water bills. The biggest upward push this month came from fresh food prices, the BRC said.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nUK consumer spending remains strong in boost for growth hopes\n\nUK economy grows a robust 0.5% in February, beating expectations\n\nFood inflation is still well below the double-digit peaks seen in 2023 after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine drove up fuel, fertiliser and feed costs for farmers.

Hui\u2019s lawyer, who was at the hearing, did not push back on the liquidator\u2019s statement.\n\nWhile the liquidators argued for the earliest date possible for the hearing to resume, Hui\u2019s lawyer asked the court for more time given that the case is \u201ccomplex\u201d and \u201csensitive\u201d. The judge said the hearing on Hui\u2019s case will not be held before Jun 30.\n\nTuesday\u2019s hearing is part of a legal battle waged by the liquidators to outline and potentially claw back scraps from one of the world\u2019s biggest corporate implosions. Clarity on Evergrande\u2019s assets tied to Hui is crucial for liquidation as the filings show he controls nearly 60 per cent of the total stake.\n\nHui\u2019s lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAn emblem of China\u2019s years-long property crisis, Evergrande defaulted in 2021, resulting in a creditor petition to liquidate the company.

He was the seventh of eight SDP speakers, with party chief Chee Soon Juan delivering the final speech.\n\nIn his 23-minute speech, Dr Chee criticised several incidents that occurred under the government\u2019s watch.\n\nSaid Dr Chee: \u201cI\u2019m going to list out a list of PAP scandals and screw-ups only because our PAP ministers keep running the propaganda that they are exceptional, and that they don\u2019t need an opposition to hold them accountable.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nGE2025: From \u2018the best team\u2019 to building democracy: parties\u2019 first political broadcasts\n\nGE2025: Singapore can return to \u2018the road to democracy\u2019 started in 2011: SDP\u2019s Paul Tambyah\n\nHe cited Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong\u2019s handling of former speaker of Parliament\n\nTan Chuan-Jin\u2019s\n\naffair; the use of\n\nTraceTogether data\n\nfor police investigations; the\n\nRidout Road\n\ncontroversy; and the\n\nsix-day MRT disruption\n\non the East-West Line, as some examples.\n\n\u201cMy message is not that the PAP (or) this government is 100 per cent bad or that it\u2019s 100 per cent good,\u201d Dr Chee said.\n\n\u201cWhat I want to get across to you, is that the PAP is most certainly not the exceptional party that it says that it is. And if you\u2019re not exceptional, then be humble.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s event was the second lunchtime rally of this year\u2019s General Election (GE), following the\n\nPAP\u2019s rally\n\nat the same venue on Monday.\n\nThe SDP is the only opposition party to have held a lunchtime rally since 1997, when the Workers\u2019 Party last did so; the last time the SDP held such a rally in the Central Business District was during GE2015.\n\nDr Tambyah is contesting Bukit Panjang SMC, where he\n\nfaces a rematch\n\nagainst PAP\u2019s Liang Eng Hwa, who narrowly defeated him five years ago with 53.73 per cent of the vote \u2013 the closest margin among all the single-ward contests that year.\n\nFear tactics\n\nAt the rally, other SDP candidates spoke about the ruling party\u2019s \u201cfear tactics\u201d, urging voters not to let \u201cfear guide (their) decisions\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs we turn into the final days of the campaign, you will hear the PAP turn up the fear rhetoric,\u201d said James Gomez, a candidate for Sembawang GRC.\n\n\u201cWhen you vote for a stronger opposition, you are not hurting Singapore \u2013 you are only threatening the PAP\u2019s desire for total control,\u201d he added.\n\nFirst-time candidate Ariffin Sha, standing in Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC, also urged voters to reject what he described as the \u201cpolicy of fear\u201d.\n\n\u201cDo not let the PAP\u2019s fear tactics sway you in any way,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are not shortchanging yourself by voting for an SDP MP in Parliament \u2013 the government\u2019s programmes will still go on your estate.\u201d\n\nOther speakers at Tuesday\u2019s lunchtime rally included Jufri Salim, contesting Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC, as well as Alfred Tan, Damanhuri Abas, and Bryan Lim, who are all part of the Sembawang GRC slate.\n\nFor more election coverage, visit our\n\nGE2025 microsite\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWhat's moving the markets?

Lee said that the Fuzhou concert venue has a capacity of about 1,000.\n\nThe news fuelled a rally in South Korean entertainment stocks, with K-pop stocks helping charge the small-cap Kosdaq Index higher.\n\nThe timing may be coincidental, but it adds to growing evidence that China is seeking to improve relations with regional partners as countries grapple with increasingly hostile and unpredictable trade policies under US President Donald Trump.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nFriday, 2 pm\n\nLifestyle\n\nOur picks of the latest dining, travel and leisure options to treat yourself.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nLast month, trade chiefs of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul, where they renewed calls for an open, fair flow of goods and pledged to deepen economic ties.\n\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Culture and Tourism did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.\n\nChina imposed the so-called \u201cK-wave ban\u201d in 2016 in retaliation for Seoul allowing the US military to deploy missile defence system called Thaad, or Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense.

Lotte Group pulled back by selling its supermarket business and exiting a theme park project under development. Companies such as Samsung Electronics have shifted production from China to Vietnam and other countries.\n\nThe latest move raised doubts among curious Chinese fans, and some took to the social media asking: \u201cHas the Korea ban been lifted?\u201d\n\nEpex\u2019s plans come as some Korean movie and K-pop stars have cautiously resumed their activities in mainland China. Some attended a Ralph Lauren fashion show in Shanghai, holding fan meet-ups in major cities that have been shunned since China\u2019s ban. Korean producers have also begun talks over content exports, while there have been no official approvals on the Korean dramas yet by the Chinese government.\n\nJi In-hae, an analyst at Shinhan Securities, said in a recent note that if China allows K-pop singers to perform at large concert halls and permit local broadcasters to air new Korean dramas simultaneously, it would be a \u201creal, substantial\u201d signal of relaxed restrictions.

This was driven by both public housing and private projects such as Changi Airport Terminal 5 or Tuas Port.\n\nThe 2025 Budget is another area that is \u201cdelivering generous transfers\u201d which could boost domestic stocks, Wickramasinghe noted.\n\n\u201cThe government has ample dry powder to introduce more fiscal stimulus,\u201d he said.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nAsia: Markets mixed on Monday as investors eye trade talks\n\nSingapore\u2019s growth outlook turns more cautious as US tariffs deliver \u2018negative shock\u2019: MAS\n\nThe estimated accumulated fiscal surplus over the current electoral term is S$14.3 billion or around 1.9 per cent of the gross domestic product, he said. This can be drawn over FY2025 without needing to tap past reserves.\n\nMoreover, the Singapore government has historically deployed strong stimulus during \u201ctimes of extreme stress\u201d.\n\nFor instance, during the global pandemic five years ago, fiscal stimulus was raised to 14.4 per cent of the GDP under the Covid-19 Stimulus Package alongside a further 8 per cent of GDP from past reserves drawdowns.\n\n\u201cCombined, these factors could support relatively better domestic earnings visibility,\u201d he said.\n\nPotential winners\n\nThe report screened Singapore-listed stocks with a market capitalisation above S$400 million that derive over 50 per cent of revenues locally, as these could benefit from domestic stimulus.\u00a0As a secondary criterion, it surveyed stocks generating revenues from China and South-east Asia, which could gain on supply chain shifts from tariff arbitrage.\n\n\u201cOur screening shows property \u2013 especially real estate investment trusts (Reits) and construction \u2013 industrials, consumer and healthcare are potential winners,\u201d said the analyst.\n\nHe said that banks were excluded from the screening. \u201cWhile the sector derives more than 50 per cent of income from Singapore, they are much more directly linked to the global trade cycle, thus not fully reflecting pure domestic consumption.\u201d\n\nNoting that stocks related to real estate and Reits accounted for more than half of the screened list, Wickramasinghe said that falling domestic benchmark rates should be a positive signal for Reits.\n\nStress tests conducted under global financial crisis-level scenarios have indicated that retail and industrial rents would remain resilient, he added.\n\nAmong the Reits,\n\nCapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust : C38U +0.45%\n\n,\n\nFrasers Centrepoint Trust : J69U +1.37%\n\nand\n\nMapletree Pan Asia Commercial Trust : N2IU +0.81%\n\nscreened favourably, he added.\n\nBesides Reits, property development and construction companies \u2013 including\n\nBukit Sembawang Estates : B61 +0.23%\n\nand\n\nOUE  : 5WA 0%\n\n\u2013 emerged as attractive opportunities.\n\nAccording to Wickramasinghe, industrial and utilities companies with long-term offtake contracts and strong order books are well-positioned to benefit domestically. These include names such as\n\nSembcorp Industries : U96 +1.49%\n\nand\n\nKeppel : BN4 +1.03%\n\n.\n\nConsumer and healthcare sectors could similarly see upside from \u201cdomestic spillover demand driven by fiscal stimulus\u201d, he added, with screened names such as\n\nKimly : 1D0 0%\n\n.\n\nTransport and communication companies such as\n\nSBS Transit : S61 +1.72%\n\nand Vicom are expected to demonstrate resilience supported by steady domestic demand.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWhat's moving the markets?

As a result, China hopes the US can create a stable and predictable environment for normal trade and investment activities, according to Tuesday\u2019s statement.\n\nChina earlier this month ordered its airlines not to take any further deliveries of Boeing jets as part of the tit-for-tat trade war that\u2019s seen Trump levy tariffs of as high as 145 per cent on Chinese goods. The order came after China unveiled retaliatory tariffs of 125 per cent on American goods, levies that would have more than doubled the cost of US-made aircraft and parts, making it impractical for Chinese airlines to accept Boeing planes.\n\nBoeing chief executive officer Kelly Ortberg confirmed last Wednesday that China has stopped taking deliveries of any planes and said the planemaker is prepared to find alternative buyers for China-bound aircraft.\n\n\u201cWe are in close communication with our China customers and we are actively assessing options for remarketing already built or in process airplanes,\u201d Ortberg said during Boeing\u2019s earnings call.\n\nThe move has left in doubt the fate of about 50 jets that were slated to go to China this year. Boeing has since begun flying 737 Max jets that were refused by Chinese airline customers back to the US.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nS&P removes Boeing\u2019s rating from CreditWatch negative on improving aircraft production\n\nAirbus to take over Spirit asset as part of Boeing reintegration\n\nBoeing ready to resell jets as tariffs hit China trade\n\nBoeing reports small quarterly loss, confirms 2025 plane output targets\n\nBoeing to sell Jeppesen unit to Thoma Bravo for US$10.55 billion\n\nMore\n\nAmong airlines that are willing recipients of the aircraft rejected by China is Air India. Through the end of last month, the Indian airline had accepted 41 737 Max jets originally built for Chinese airlines, and the carrier has signalled it\u2019s eager to take more, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nAn olive branch from Beijing would be a boon for Chinese airlines, many of whom had been relying on Boeing jets for their expansion plans. China is forecast to make up 20 per cent of global aircraft demand over the next two decades and in 2018, nearly a quarter of Boeing\u2019s output ended up there.

He previously anchored Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, and will not be contesting the May 3 general election as he retires from politics after 33 years.\n\nContinuity, stability and good governance are hallmarks of Singapore \u2013 and \u201cvery valuable\u201d in uncertain times when people look at these traits to invest their money, he said.\n\nMinister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office Indranee Rajah anchors the PAP\u2019s four-member team in the newly formed constituency, which includes Senior Minister of State Desmond Tan, Sharael Taha, and first-time candidate Valerie Lee.\n\nThe PAP team is up against a slate from the Singapore Democratic Alliance, which comprises its chairman Desmond Lim, Abu Mohamed, Harminder Pal Singh and Chia Yun Kai.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nSpeaking after SM Teo, Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office Maliki Osman \u2013 who was in the East Coast GRC before he stepped down ahead of the election \u2013 also addressed the issue of continuity.\n\nA fresh team represents the residents of Pasir Ris-Changi, with new perspectives on how to improve the neighbourhoods and communities, \u201cbut with the same commitment that has led to the results you have seen in these years\u201d, he said.\n\nIn her speech, Lee, advocating for the sandwich generation, highlighted that Singapore \u201chas built support systems, and (they have) been enhanced by feedback\u201d from Singaporeans.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nGE2025: PAP will provide support for Singaporeans for as long as necessary, says Indranee\n\nGE2025: Losing three, four ministers would weaken both the government and Singapore, says PM Wong\n\n\u201cBut we can do better, and we must go further, because the situation is evolving,\u201d she said.\n\nBeyond listening to Singaporeans and being their voice, being Members of Parliament is about hard work, the rally speakers said.\n\n\u201cThe opposition may want to be the voices of the people in Parliament, but the PAP is your voice,\u201d said Maliki. \u201cAnd we are not just your voice, we are also your hands that do the work.\u201d\n\nOpposition parties have said in many speeches that they will raise Singaporeans\u2019 concerns in Parliament, said Sharael.\n\nHe added: \u201cI believe that building the future we want takes more than just raising concerns. It takes hard work. It takes rolling up our sleeves together. It\u2019s about the action. It\u2019s about the heart. It\u2019s about us, moving together, hand in hand.\u201d\n\nOther PAP rallies\n\nThere were two other evening rallies by the PAP on Monday. At the Jurong Central SMC rally, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said that no major decisions \u2013 including the move to raise the goods and services tax (GST) \u2013 are easy to make, but it is the PAP that is prepared to make these hard decisions.\n\nFu, who leads the Jurong East-Bukit Batok GRC team, said there are trade-offs when it comes to policymaking.\n\nOn the GST increase, the government set up a permanent support system to help Singaporeans with little or no income, such as vouchers, MediSave top-ups and U-Save rebates.\n\n\u201cWe may be taking a chicken wing from you, but we are giving you a whole chicken,\u201d said Fu.\n\nAt the Sembawang GRC rally, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said it was \u201cdisingenuous\u201d of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) to say that the plans and projects for the constituency will carry on no matter who the MP is, so long as the PAP continues to form the government.\n\nOng leads the PAP\u2019s five-member team in a three-way battle with the SDP and the National Solidarity Party.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they can come here for one month and make all these sweeping statements,\u201d said Ong.\n\nHe noted that when there are major national projects such as the Thomson-East Coast Line and the Woodlands Health Campus, it is the Cabinet that makes the key decisions.\n\nFor more election coverage, visit our\n\nGE2025 microsite\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Sony is considering distributing the bulk of its holding in the chip business to shareholders, and may retain a minority holding after the spinoff, one of the sources said.\n\nDeliberations are ongoing and the plan may change, especially given the volatility of markets in the wake of US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, one of the sources said.\n\nA representative of Sony declined to comment. A Sony Semiconductor spokesperson said he could not comment on speculation.\n\nSony, which is also planning to spin off its financial arm, is following some of billionaire investor Dan Loeb\u2019s blueprint to unlock billions of US dollars in shareholder value, years after resisting pressure from Loeb\u2019s Third Point for the company to do so. The fund sold its Sony American depository receipts in 2020.\n\nOperating profit margins at Sony\u2019s imaging and sensing solutions segment has been steadily declining from about 25 per cent to a little over 10 per cent over the years.

So too are the PAP, People\u2019s Power Party (PPP), Red Dot United (RDU) and WP.\n\nScroll down for the rally locations and timings, along with livestream links to watch them online.\n\nPAP: SM Lee, PM Wong rebut WP rally claims\n\nOn a walkabout in Aljunied GRC this morning, Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong\n\nsaid it was \u201cridiculous\u201d to claim\n\nthat the government would not be weakened if the PAP loses ministers.\n\nHe was responding to\n\nWP candidates who said at Monday\u2019s night rally\n\nthat the PAP can afford to lose Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong, who leads the ruling party\u2019s team against the WP in Punggol GRC.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nNoting how the PAP has stressed the importance of DPM Gan, WP chief Pritam Singh said Singapore would be \u201cin trouble\u201d if no one else in Cabinet could negotiate with the US on tariffs.\n\nSingh also speculated that DPM Gan had intended to retire \u2013 as he was not elected into the PAP\u2019s latest Central Executive Committee (CEC) \u2013 and would likely serve just one more term if re-elected.\n\nTo that, SM Lee said that Singh cannot admit how valuable DPM Gan is, because the WP is trying to make in-roads in Punggol GRC.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nGE2025: PM Wong takes aim at WP\u2019s \u2018negative politics\u2019, says DPM Gan has \u2018done so much\u2019 for Singapore\n\nGE2025: SDP\u2019s Paul Tambyah calls on Chan Chun Sing to reassure voters they can vote \u2018without fear of retribution\u2019\n\nGE2025: \u2018A ridiculous argument\u2019 that losing ministers will not weaken government, says SM Lee in Aljunied GRC\n\nAt a separate walkabout in Punggol, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said: \u201cNot being a member of the CEC is an irrelevant point, because Gan Kim Yong is a key member of my team. He\u2019s my deputy.\u201d\n\nDPM Gan had decided not to run in the CEC elections in order to allow for renewal of the party, he added.\n\nPAP: DPM Gan addresses controversial Income-Allianz deal\n\nAt the same walkabout with PM Wong,\n\nDPM Gan clarified his role in the Income-Allianz deal\n\n, which has emerged as a hot topic this GE.\n\nFormer NTUC Income chief Tan Suee Chieh and\n\nvarious opposition candidates have raised questions about DPM Gan\u2019s role in approving the deal\n\nas chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).\n\nOn Tuesday, DPM Gan said that when MAS saw the proposal in July, the focus was the main transfer of ownership in Income. Approval for\n\nAllianz\u2019s plan to extract capital from Income\n\n\u2013 as part of plans to return S$1.85 billion to shareholders \u2013 would have \u201ccome much later\u201d.\n\nAs for the apparent change in the government\u2019s stance, he said: \u201cWhen the deal was first surfaced, the government (and) various agencies took a positive approach. We understood that Income needed to do this to strengthen its capital base to be able to move forward.\u201d\n\nBut as more information came to light, there was concern \u201cabout how the new entity would be able to fulfil the social mission\u201d. After that, MAS and the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth discussed and presented the issue to the Cabinet.\n\nWP: Pritam Singh welcomes \u201cmore responsibility\u201d for opposition\n\nAt a morning doorstop in Hougang, WP chief Singh replied to PM Wong\u2019s comment \u2013 made in the PAP\u2019s Monday lunchtime rally \u2013 that the opposition wants more seats in Parliament, but not more responsibility.\n\n\u201cI welcome him to give us more responsibility,\u201d said Singh. \u201cHe can have us on committees.\u201d\n\nAt Monday\u2019s rally, Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office Indranee Rajah also said that opposition parties often call on voters to bring alternative voices into Parliament, but rarely acknowledge that such voices are guaranteed through 12 Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) seats.\n\nTo this, Singh said that NCMPs have no constituents from whom to solicit feedback. He said that the PAP does not want elected opposition MPs because \u201conly an elected opposition can take any pressure and push the government\u201d.\n\nSDP: Party leaders call for healthy competition at lunchtime rally\n\nA day after the\n\nPAP held this election\u2019s first lunchtime rally\n\nin the Central Business District, the SDP did the same. The SDP is the only opposition party to have held a lunchtime rally since 1997, when the WP last did so.\n\nSDP secretary-general Chee Soon Juan and chairman Paul Tambyah spoke at the rally at UOB Plaza promenade\n\n, along with six other candidates:\n\nJufri Salim\n\nAlfred Tan\n\nAriffin Sha\n\nDamanhuri Abas\n\nJames Gomez\n\nBryan Lim\n\nDr Tambyah said that Education Minister Chan Chun Sing, who is also Minister-in-charge of the Public Service, should reassure Singaporeans that they can \u201cvote freely without fear of retribution\u201d.\n\nHe cited an article in\n\nThe Straits Times\n\npublished on Monday, in which a 21-year-old law student who attended an SDP rally the day before declined to reveal her name when advised against it by her father, an employee in a government-linked corporation.\n\nDr Chee cited several incidents that occurred\u00a0under the government\u2019s watch, calling them \u201chard, unmistakable evidence of the quality of PAP deteriorating over the years\u201d.\n\nThese included SM Lee\u2019s handling of former Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin\u2019s affair, the use of TraceTogether data for police investigations, the Ridout Road controversy, and the six-day MRT breakdown on the East West Line.\n\n\u201cBlind faith lulls society into thinking that things are fine when they are clearly not. And worse, that there is no alternative to the PAP,\u201d he said.\n\nIn case you missed it, here\u2019s our\n\nlivestream of the rally\n\nto watch at your leisure.\n\nAnd here are the locations and times of today\u2019s rallies.

The startup hinted at a tie-up with a logistics firm in February, posting a 90-second video on X that showed its sleek, five-foot-six-inch robot standing beside a conveyor belt, picking and sorting small parcels.\n\nA growing number of startups and Big Tech firms are seizing on recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technology to develop robots that look and move more like people. Figure has emerged as one of the most prominent startups in this group.\n\nThe company has held talks with investors to raise US$1.5 billion at a valuation of US$39.5 billion, Bloomberg reported in February.\n\nMore recently, some have questioned whether Figure may have exaggerated the extent of its work with customer BMW.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nUPS breaks with Amazon to take \u2018control of own destiny\u2019\n\nUPS sees profit growth for first time in nearly 2 years\n\nUPS misses quarterly estimates on high labour costs, weak small-package demand\n\nIn a statement, UPS said it would not discuss \u201cspecific or potential vendor partners\u201d, adding that \u201cwe regularly explore and deploy a wide range of technologies, including robotics\u201d. A representative for Figure declined to comment.\n\nIn recent years, UPS has increased its automation efforts. The company deploys fixed robotic arms and AI-driven software in its high-tech Velocity facilities. UPS also partnered with Dexterity, a startup building industrial robots capable of \u201chuman-like\u201d finesse.

That will require making deals with smaller parties but still marks an extraordinary comeback for the Liberals, who earlier this year looked headed for an electoral wipeout.\n\nPierre Poilievre\u2019s Conservative Party had been on track to win the vote but Trump\u2019s attacks, combined with the departure of unpopular former prime minister Justin Trudeau, transformed the race.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nCarney, who replaced Trudeau as prime minister just last month, convinced voters that his experience managing economic crises made him the ideal candidate to defy Trump.\n\nPoilievre, whose party was on track to form a strong opposition, conceded defeat on Tuesday and promised to work with the Liberals to counter Trump.\n\n\u201cWe will always put Canada first,\u201d Poilievre told supporters in Ottawa. \u201cConservatives will work with the prime minister and all parties with the common goal of defending Canada\u2019s interests and getting a new trade deal that puts these tariffs behind us while protecting our sovereignty.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nCanada votes for new government to take on Trump\n\n\u2018Closest of allies\u2019\n\nBritish leader Keir Starmer congratulated Carney and said he looked forward to strengthening bilateral ties, adding that the two countries are \u201cthe closest of allies, partners and friends\u201d.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also said she anticipated working with Ottawa to \u201cdefend our shared democratic values, promote multilateralism, and champion free and fair trade\u201d.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry said it was \u201cwilling to develop China-Canada relations on the basis of mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefit\u201d.\n\nThe two countries have had a rocky relationship, with Ottawa and Beijing currently embroiled in a trade spat over tech and agriculture exports.\n\nMeanwhile India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was keen to grow relations with Ottawa and \u201cunlock greater opportunities for our people\u201d.\n\nCanada has accused New Delhi of being involved in the assassination of a Canadian who campaigned for Sikhs to secede from India \u2013 a claim which Modi\u2019s government has denied.\n\nNato chief Mark Rutte congratulated Prime Minister Mark Carney, calling Canada a valued member of Nato and saying he looked forward to working together to build a stronger, fairer alliance by investing more in defence and ramping up industrial production to ensure safety.\n\nFrance\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron said Prime Minister Mark Carney embodies a strong Canada in the face of today\u2019s great challenges, and added that France looks forward to further strengthening the friendship between the two countries and working alongside him.\n\n\u2018We are Canada\u2019\n\nWhen the Liberal win was announced, cheers of joy erupted at the Ottawa venue where Liberal supporters watched the results.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got somebody that can speak to Trump on his level,\u201d said Dorothy Goubault, 72. \u201cTrump is a businessperson. Carney is a businessperson, and I think they can both relate.\u201d\n\nLiberal lawmaker and a member of Carney\u2019s Cabinet, Steven Guilbeault, tied the outcome to Trump. \u201cThe numerous attacks by President Trump on the Canadian economy, but not just the economy, on our sovereignty and our very identity, have really mobilised Canadians,\u201d he told the CBC.\n\nHe said that Canadians saw Carney as \u201csomeone who has experience with the economy\u201d.\n\nCarney led the Bank of Canada through the 2008-2009 financial crisis and headed the Bank of England through the turmoil surrounding the 2016 Brexit vote.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s departure\n\nTrudeau\u2019s departure was crucial to the Liberal win, which capped one of the most dramatic turnarounds in Canadian political history.\n\nOn Jan 6, the day Trudeau announced he would resign, the Conservatives led the Liberals by more than 20 points in most polls, as public anger over soaring costs mounted after Trudeau\u2019s decade in power.\n\nCarney distanced himself from Trudeau throughout the campaign. He said the former prime minister did not focus enough on growing Canada\u2019s economy and scrapped a controversial Trudeau carbon tax that left many voters seething.\n\nFor Poilievre, a 45-year-old who has been in parliament for two decades, the outcome marks a stinging defeat. He was criticised for the at-times muted anger he directed towards Trump, but said he wanted to keep the focus on domestic concerns.\n\nHe tried to persuade voters that Carney would simply offer a continuation of the failed Liberal governance.\n\nAt the Conservative watch party in Ottawa, Jason Piche told AFP he was surprised by the result. \u201cI was hoping to have a big celebration tonight,\u201d Piche said.

The remaining 1.4 per cent or S$6.1 million was allocated to pay other fees related to the fundraising exercise.\n\nRevenue for H1 was up 7.1 per cent at S$184.4 million from S$172.2 million. Net property income (NPI) rose 7.3 per cent to S$133.7 million from S$124.6 million in the previous corresponding period.\n\nDistributions to unitholders for the period rose 4.9 per cent on the year to S$110.1 million from S$104.9 million, mainly due to higher NPI, the full six-month contribution from the acquisition of an additional 24.5 per cent interest in Gold Ridge, and better performance by the Waterway Point and Nex malls.

Cost of debt fell to 3.8 per cent this quarter from 4 per cent in the previous quarter.\n\nLooking ahead, the manager said that healthy population growth from new home builds over the near to mid-term in the vicinity of its malls, coupled with rising household incomes and supportive government measures such as the Progressive Wage Model and disbursement schemes, will continue to drive tenant sales and hence, growth for FCT.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nFrasers Centrepoint Trust preferential offering 24.8% oversubscribed\n\nFCT\u2019s private placement raises S$220 million to finance Northpoint City deal, repay debt\n\nFrasers Centrepoint Trust to buy rest of Northpoint City for S$1.17 billion\n\nThe manager expects interest rate movements and an increase in operating expenses to remain the key factors behind the Reit\u2019s performance. Barring unforeseen circumstances, FCT\u2019s average cost of borrowings are expected to stay below 4 per cent for H2 FY2025.\n\nIt will also continue to drive cost optimisation initiatives for its operations and adopt appropriate hedging strategies for energy contracts to mitigate the impact on its expenses on utilities.\n\nUnits of FCT closed unchanged on Monday at S$2.25.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWhat's moving the markets?

Yet, it is not just the ruling party under pressure, but also the main opposition Conservatives, which could allow for the biggest breakthrough for Reform UK leader Nigel Farage since the 2016 Brexit referendum.\n\nThe shakeup is potentially so significant that one of the UK\u2019s top pollsters, John Curtice, asserts \u201cthe conditions are there for the biggest challenge to the political conventions of British politics since the 1920s\u201d. What Curtice points to is the growing threat to the two-way Labour-Conservative duopoly that had dominated UK politics for a century, from Reform UK on the political right, and also the Liberal Democrats, Greens, Scottish National Party (SNP) and the Welsh Nationalist Plaid Cymru on the centre and left.\n\nTo be sure, the exact results remain uncertain of Thursday\u2019s English council ballots, multiple English mayoral elections, Welsh devolved assembly ballots, and also a parliamentary by-election in Runcorn.

That will allow the Treasury Department to continue to forecast a return to budget surplus in 2029, while the government retains its aim to get there in 2028, she said.\n\n\u201cLet me be blunt: it\u2019s not the easiest time to be putting together a budget,\u201d Willis said. \u201cThere is a pressing need for greater investments in our health system, our education system, our defence force and other areas, and very little money to pay for those investments.\u201d\n\nThe economic uncertainty unleashed by US tariffs is expected to curb global growth and therefore demand for New Zealand exports. Willis said while Treasury still expects the economy to grow, its has lowered its forecasts for gross domestic product in 2025 and 2026, which will reduce tax revenue.\n\nThe government will not raise taxes on wages, savings, wealth or capital and sees economic growth as the most effective way to increase revenue, she said.\n\nThe budget will focus on health, education, law and order, defence, and a small number of critical social investments.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\n\u201cWe have also found room for modest measures to support business growth and to provide some carefully targeted cost-of-living relief,\u201d Willis said.

Transport networks were halted, hospitals were left without power and people were trapped in the metro and in lifts.\n\nIn Madrid, hundreds of people stood in the streets outside office buildings and there was a heavy police presence around some important buildings, with officers directing traffic as well as driving along central atriums with lights.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThe Spanish and Portuguese governments met to discuss the outage, which also briefly affected parts of France, and a crisis committee was set up in Spain, sources familiar with the situation said.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez visited electricity transmission operator Red El\u00e9ctrica\u2019s control centre.\n\n\u201cThe government is working to determine the origin and impact of this incident and is dedicating all resources to resolve it as soon as possible,\u201d the Spanish government said.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nAirlines question Heathrow readiness after shutdown sparks global flight chaos\n\nRed Electrica said it was working with regional energy companies to restore power. Portuguese utility REN said it had activated plans for the phased restoration of the electricity supply.\n\nPlay at the Madrid Open tennis tournament was suspended, forcing 15th seed Grigor Dimitrov and British opponent Jacob Fearnley off the court as scoreboards went dark and overhead cameras lost power.\n\nThe European Commission said it was in contact with the authorities in Spain and Portugal and the European network of transmission system operators ENTSO-E to try to establish the cause of the outage.\n\nPower outages on this scale are rare in Europe. In 2003 a problem with a hydroelectric power line between Italy and Switzerland caused a major outage across the whole Italian peninsula for around 12 hours.\n\nIn Madrid, the air was filled with the sound of police sirens and helicopters clattered overhead.\n\nThe towering Torre Emperador skyscraper in the Spanish capital was evacuated via stairs. Worried people tried desperately to reach their children\u2019s schools as the cell signal came and went.\n\nIn a video posted on X, Madrid Mayor Jose Luis Martinez-Almeida urged the capital\u2019s residents to minimise all travel and stay at their current locations if possible.\n\nAirports reported delays. AENA, which manages 46 airports in Spain, reported flight delays around the country.\n\nPortugal\u2019s airport operator ANA said airports activated emergency generators which for now allows essential airport operations to be maintained at Porto and Faro airports.\n\n\u201cIn Lisbon, operations are ongoing but with limitations. So far, there have been no impacts on Madeira and Azores airports,\u201d it said.

This was due to 94 Lenore Drive, a logistics property in Sydney, being vacant as well as a drop in occupancy of more than 30 percentage points at 108 Wickham Street in Brisbane. Clar\u2019s manager is in discussions with a prospective tenant to lease the Sydney property, while commitment has been secured for part of the vacant space in the Brisbane property.\n\nBoth Singapore and the US saw portfolio occupancy fall 0.9 per cent qoq in Q1 2025. The Singapore portfolio\u2019s occupancy decreased to 91.6 per cent in this quarter due to Telepark, a data centre, registering a decline in occupancy to 6 per cent from 99.6 per cent as at end-December 2024. This was partially offset by high occupancy rates at Techpoint and 3 Changi Business Park Vista.\n\nThe US saw occupancy decrease to 88 per cent in Q1 2025 due to Quebec, a logistics property in Kansas City, recording a fall in occupancy to 74.3 per cent from being fully occupied as at Dec 31, 2024. San Diego property 5005 & 5010 Wateridge, a business space asset, saw occupancy drop to 64.4 per cent from being full occupied as at Dec 31, 2024. However, an asset enhancement initiative will commence at the property in the second quarter of this year.\n\nClar still secured a higher rental reversion in Q1 2025, with Australia recording the highest at 59 per cent, followed by the US at 10.3 per cent and Singapore at 7 per cent.

Right now the pick-up (between short- and long-end bonds) is quite little,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile the market has priced in about three to four rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve by the end of the year, Ng said his research team believes that there might be fewer cuts due to uncertainties on inflation and growth rates in the US following President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nIssue 145: South-east Asia\u2019s sunburn; favourable market greets Singapore green bond auction\n\nData centres can be financed with Singapore green bonds under revised framework\n\n\u201cWe think the Fed will be pressured to keep rates higher for longer,\u201d he added.\n\nIf the rate cuts play out as the market is expecting for the rest of 2025, Ng said that there will be still room for the yields for short-end bonds in Singapore to drop. Long-dated bonds, such as the 30-year green bonds, however, should remain largely unaffected.\n\nThis second tranche of 30-year green bonds has a coupon rate of 3.25 per cent and a maturity date of Jun 1, 2054. The bonds are expected to be issued on May 2, with coupon payments disbursed on the first day of June and December every year, until maturity or when they are redeemed.\n\nIts reopening is the fifth in a series of sovereign green bonds that has been issued under the Singapore Green Bond framework.\n\nBesides these 30-year green bonds which were issued in May last year for the first time, there were three offerings of 50-year sovereign green bonds since August 2022.\n\nThe Singapore government has indicated that a pipeline of up to S$35 billion of sovereign and public-sector green bonds will be issued by 2030. Thus far, S$11.3 billion has been issued.\n\nA key aspect of the green label for the bonds is that proceeds will be used to finance expenditures in support of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, including two new MRT lines \u2013 the Jurong Region Line and the Cross Island Line.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG\n\n[BANGKOK] Thailand will require foreign visitors to fill up a pre-departure digital form from May 1, a move that will make it easy for authorities to track travellers amid a broadening crackdown against human trafficking into South-east Asia\u2019s illegal cybercrime centres.\n\nStarting on Monday (Apr 28), travellers can fill up the Thailand Digital Arrival Card for trips beginning on Thursday. The online card replaces the previously used paper form, and is mandatory for all foreigners entering the country by air, land or sea routes, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The forms can be accessed on the Thai Immigration Bureau\u2019s website.\n\nThe arrival cards will be synced with Thai immigration bureau\u2019s biometric database, which will allow for screening of criminal backgrounds of visitors, Choengron Rimpadee, chief of the Immigration Division two at Suvarnabhumi Airport, told reporters last week.\n\nThe introduction of mandatory pre-departure card comes in the wake of a multinational crackdown against criminal gangs operating cyber scam centres in border towns of Myanmar and Cambodia. The viral kidnapping of a Chinese actor earlier this year triggered the campaign as traffickings through Thailand have stoked security concerns among Chinese travellers, who were the largest group of tourists last year.\n\nThailand is popular among tourists for its tropical climate, pristine beaches, a vibrant nightlife and Buddhist temples. The industry, which employs one in five of the country\u2019s workforce and accounts for about 13 per cent of gross domestic product, has welcomed about 12 million tourists since the start of the year, little changed from a year earlier.\n\nTravellers may submit the online forms up to three days before their scheduled arrival date and they can be submitted individually or as a group, according to the Tourism Authority of Thailand. Required details include passport information, personal and travel details, accommodation in Thailand, and a basic health declaration. It\u2019s modelled on the digital arrival card requirements in many other countries.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nCybercrime syndicates in South-east Asia go global, defying crackdowns: UN\n\nIndonesia to repatriate 561 Myanmar scam centre workers\n\nThailand\u2019s scam centre crackdown not enough, top lawmaker warns\n\nThailand woos rich European tourists as Chinese arrivals slump\n\nThailand plans to cut tourists\u2019 visa-free stays to 30 days\n\nMore\n\nStill, the mandatory arrival cards are unlikely to affect tourism sentiment, according to Sisdivachr Cheewarattanaporn, president of the Association of Thai Travel Agents.

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG\n\n[NEW YORK] Chinese officials vowed to provide more support for exporters affected by US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, showing greater urgency to shore up the crucial sector as signs of distress emerge.\n\nPolicymakers in Beijing on Monday (Apr 28) laid out policies to aid exporting companies, including plans to ensure troubled firms get the loans they need and boost domestic consumption to absorb the blow of US levies. The briefing amounted to Chinese officials\u2019 most detailed attempt since the start of Trump\u2019s second term to address growing trade headwinds as cargo shipments to the US plummet.\n\n\u201cSince the beginning of this year, the risks and challenges faced by China\u2019s foreign trade development have increased significantly, especially the unilateral tariffs imposed by the US,\u201d said Sheng Qiuping, vice-minister of commerce. \u201cIn order to help foreign trade enterprises actively respond to external risks and challenges, we will adhere to a goal-oriented and problem-oriented approach.\u201d\n\nThe measures represent a targeted approach to stabilising the economy as a trade war with the Trump administration continues with no immediate off-ramp in sight.\n\nBeijing is signalling it\u2019s in no rush to aggressively expand economic stimulus or jump into negotiations with the US, even as prohibitive levels of tariffs are forecast to halt bilateral trade and hurt a sector that contributed to nearly a third of the economy\u2019s expansion last year.\n\n\u201cBoth the timing, the size and approach of growth supportive measure will be flexible, pending the next move of the US,\u201d said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group, adding that Beijing has a track record of offering exporters-specific support during the pandemic and the global financial crisis.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nChina\u2019s benchmark CSI 300 Index of onshore stocks erased losses as the briefing went on. The yield on 10-year government bonds was little changed, while the yuan weakened a tad along with most regional peers as the US dollar gained.\n\nOfficials announced efforts including:\n\nGuidance for lenders to maintain loans to small and medium-sized trade firms\n\nSpecial credit tool to support the export of large equipment\n\nAssistance to firms to diversify markets\n\nReducing costs for domestic trade, such as rent and streaming fees\n\nOptimising the exchange rate hedging tool for trade firms\n\nZhao Chenxin, Vice-Chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, said authorities are \u201cfully confident\u201d in reaching the expansion target of around 5 per cent for 2025. He largely repeated vows last week by the decision-making Politburo, led by President Xi Jinping, to prepare for external shocks.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nChina says on \u2018right side of history\u2019 in trade standoff with US\n\nChina repeats vow to support jobs, economy as US tariffs hit\n\nTrump\u2019s China tariffs set to unleash supply shock on US economy\n\nChina vows to ready emergency plans, signals calm amid trade war\n\nChina waives tariffs on some US goods, but denies Trump\u2019s claim that talks are underway\n\nMore\n\nIn an early sign of trouble for exporters, cargo shipments have plummeted since the US raised levies on China to 145 per cent early this month, perhaps by as much as 60 per cent, according to one estimate.\n\nThere are currently about 40 cargo ships that recently stopped at ports in China and are now bound for the US, down by about 40 per cent from early April, according to ship tracking compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nZhao highlighted the economy\u2019s resilience in the first three months of the year, including the stronger contribution of domestic demand to growth compared to the previous quarter.\n\nWhether consumers can make up for lost exports will be key to Beijing\u2019s attempt to achieve this year\u2019s growth target. Economists at international banks including UBS Group and Goldman Sachs have lowered their forecasts for China\u2019s 2025 growth in recent weeks to around 4 per cent or lower.\n\nXi previously vowed to make boosting domestic consumption a top economic priority this year, although consumer confidence remains sluggish as a property market slump zapped a main source of wealth for households.\n\nYu Jiadong, Vice-Minister of Human Resources and Social Security, acknowledged the adverse effects of US tariffs, saying some exporters face business difficulties and some jobs are affected. He said the government will take steps to improve workers\u2019 skills and prioritise youth employment.\n\nChina will also free up more cash for banks and cut interest rates at an appropriate time, according to Zou Lan, deputy governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China. He reiterated the Chinese central bank would keep the yuan stable at a \u201creasonable and equilibrium\u201d level, adding that the foreign exchange market\u2019s resilience provides strong support for a stable yuan.\n\nYuyuantantian, a social media account affiliated with state-run China Central Television that regularly signals Beijing\u2019s thinking about trade, said in a post after the briefing that the new and previously announced measures will be implemented by the end of June, without specifying the policies.\n\nChina appeared to have resisted rushing into any trade negotiations with Trump. Officials last week dismissed claims that there were talks on reaching a trade deal and reiterated a demand for Washington to revoke all unilateral tariffs.\n\nBefore talks begin, officials in Beijing want to see Trump show more respect by reining in disparaging remarks by members of his cabinet, Bloomberg previously reported. China also wants the US to name a point person for talks and show a willingness to address China\u2019s concerns around American sanctions and Taiwan, the self-ruled island Beijing considers its territory.\n\nDespite the rhetoric, Beijing is quietly considering suspending its 125 per cent retaliatory tariffs on some US imports, a move that will contain the fallout of the trade war on certain sectors.\n\n\u201cThe way the Chinese government is making exemptions, clearly they don\u2019t want their own economy to be harmed by the tariffs that they lay on,\u201d Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China told Bloomberg Television, adding that member companies have already seen exemptions in IT, health care and aviation sectors.

PHOTO: AFP\n\n[BEIJING] Discount Chinese retail app Temu appears to be passing on nearly all of US President Donald Trump\u2019s new import taxes to US consumers, more than doubling the cost of some products in a move that may add to concern about the inflationary impact of tariffs.\n\nPreviously exempted from any levies under the so-called \u2018de minimis\u2019 rule, parcels priced up to US$800 now face an ad-valorem tax \u2013 of 120 per cent of a product\u2019s value \u2013 or a per postal item fee of at least US$100 starting May 2. PDD Holdings-owned Temu is requiring customers to pay those levies on top of the original cost of the goods.\n\nA look at 14 shipped-from-China items on Temu\u2019s bestsellers list showed taxes exceeded the value of the product. A US$19.49 power strip, for instance, attracted US$27.56 in import charges as of Monday (Apr 28), or 1.41 times the price of the product. However, there are no import surcharges on items that are already available in US warehouses, keeping the prices of such goods generally stable.\n\nAmong the top 80 items on Temu\u2019s recommended bestsellers, 66 items are marked to be shipped from local warehouses, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Temu and rival Shein Group previously said they will start adjusting prices one week ahead of the May 2 de minimis tariff exemption removal.\n\nThe higher costs illustrate the impact of President Trump\u2019s tariffs, and they risk changing how Americans shop and disrupting shipments from the likes of Temu and Shein. The increase is part of Trump\u2019s wider strategy to force China to seek a trade deal that would narrow Washington\u2019s trade deficit with Beijing.\n\nTemu did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nTrump signs order ending duty-free treatment for cheap shipments from China\n\nSingapore-headquartered Shein hikes US prices as much as 377% ahead of tariff spikes\n\nTemu, Shein see US sales surge ahead of small parcel tariff\n\nTemu, Shein slash digital ads as tariffs end cheap shipping from China, data show\n\nShein\u2019s tariff-busting shift hits home in Chinese factory hub\n\nMore\n\nTemu has been asking Chinese factories to ship their goods in bulk to American warehouses back in February in what it calls a \u201chalf-custody\u201d framework where it only manages the online marketplace.\n\nHowever, as inventory in the US depletes over time, prices could eventually go up when factories replenish stocks if tariffs on Chinese imports remain elevated at 145 per cent.\n\nFast-fashion giant Shein also raised US prices of its products, with hikes of more than 300 per cent for certain items.

Distributions are scheduled on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe fund was jointly launched by Singapore-based fund manager Azure Capital and influencer agency Gushcloud International.\n\nIt finances Gushcloud\u2019s Creator Venture Program (CVP), which aims to provide financial support for digital creators through advances for over one to two years.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nUsing the creator\u2019s estimated projected income, Gushcloud can provide advance capital to the creators with a loan to value ratio of 10 to 50 per of the creator\u2019s annual earnings.\n\nDuring the contract, all income generated by the creator through brand sponsorships and platform royalties is received by Gushcloud and subsequently settled to the creator.\n\nIn exchange, the creator management company will act as the creator\u2019s business manager, taking control over their professional e-mail and social media inboxes.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nShaping the future \nof influencer marketing\n\nThis allows creators to expand their reach with brand partnerships and enhance monetisation on various platforms.\n\n\u201c(This) gives them some form of stability in their jobs ... so they can focus on being creative,\u201d said Terence Wong, CEO of Azure Capital.\n\nWong noted that in looking at the payback period for each investment, the internal rate of return should be in excess of 20 per cent.\n\nThough the contract ties the creator down for up to two years, Althea Lim, CEO of Gushcloud International, said: \u201cIn a time like this, where we live in a very uncertain world, most people will take that because that money could go somewhere so positive.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Gushcloud is working with around 200 full-time creators globally and is focusing on bringing in digital creators who are experts in their subject matter.\n\nLim estimated that subject matter experts on social media platforms such as Youtube are now getting around S$30 per thousand views.\n\n\u201cAll platforms are looking for subject matter experts right now,\u201d she added, noting that people prefer to watch videos to gain understanding on a topic.\n\nShe observed that the creator economy \u2013 currently valued at around US$250 billion \u2013 is projected to reach close to US$500 billion by 2027.\n\n\u201cThe economy is immense\u201d, said Lim. \u201cI think the ... data that scares and excites us is that six out of 10 kids under 12 today desire to be an influencer, a content creator or a YouTuber.\u201d\n\nLim noted that in 20 years\u2019 time, 90 per cent of Singaporeans will live till the age of 95. However, she added, very few creators have health insurance, own their own homes, or have a pension fund.\n\nThese are problems that Lim is eager to tackle, especially with a growing number of younger creators entering the economy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to stay,\u201d said Lim. \u201cWe want to be a long-term business because these are humongous problems that we need to solve.\u201d\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWhat's moving the markets?

That would be a record for the quarter, according to Bloomberg calculations.\n\nChina has moved to diversify its sources of grains in recent years, and has shifted to buying more Brazilian soybeans as the trade war sparked by President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs makes purchases of US crops unviable.\n\nAmerican grains like soybeans, corn and sorghum \u201ccan be easily substituted and the supplies on the international market are quite sufficient,\u201d said Zhao Chenxin, depute director of the National Development and Reform Commission. \u201cEven without purchases of US feed grains and oilseed, there won\u2019t be much impact on China\u2019s grain supply.\u201d\n\nSome Chinese companies that crush soybeans into cooking oil and animal feed, particularly for the nation\u2019s pig herd, had been forced to suspend operations after Brazil\u2019s slow start to its harvest and logistics constraints delayed shipments from the country, Yin wrote in the article, which was posted on the agriculture ministry\u2019s information centre website.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nChina\u2019s farm sector buckles up for tariffs as trade war worsens\n\nChina retaliation on US farm goods hits soybeans, bolstering Brazil\n\nChina vows steps to ease exporters\u2019 pain as Trump\u2019s tariffs hit\n\nChina says on \u2018right side of history\u2019 in trade standoff with US\n\nChina repeats vow to support jobs, economy as US tariffs hit\n\nTrump\u2019s China tariffs set to unleash supply shock on US economy\n\nChina vows to ready emergency plans, signals calm amid trade war\n\nChina waives tariffs on some US goods, but denies Trump\u2019s claim that talks are underway\n\nChina\u2019s investments in South-east Asia snarl US plans on supply chains\n\nMore\n\nSoymeal prices rallied in Dalian to the highest level since December 2023 this month, after March soybean imports plunged to the lowest level in more than a decade.

PHOTO: EPA-EFE\n\nTan Chin Hwee\n\nPublished Mon, Apr 28, 2025 \u00b7 06:44 PM\n\nFIVE years ago, when the world was experiencing the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, Liverpool won their 19th top-flight football championship trophy \u2013 but it could not celebrate the achievement in front of their supporters.\n\nOn Sunday (Apr 27), the Reds lifted the trophy for a record-equalling 20th time after demolishing Tottenham Hotspur 5-1 at Anfield. This time, they could party long into the night and the feeling was just as magical for this writer, who\u2019s been avid supporter for decades. It\u2019s almost as if an old dream has come full circle.\n\nI celebrated together with my 88-year-old father and my children \u2013 three proud generations of Liverpool supporters bound by love, resilience and belief. Moments like these are rare and precious.\n\nYet, beneath the celebration lies a much deeper story \u2013 one of transition, renewal and quiet hope.\n\nThe season began last August with plenty of uncertainty. Liverpool\u2019s long-serving Jurgen Klopp had departed in the summer after nine successful seasons in charge, and many fans feared Liverpool would stumble without their beloved German manager.\n\nKlopp embodied the club\u2019s spirit at its brightest in recent years. During the few brief occasions when I met him, he was always full of positive energy. To me, he was more than just a manager.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nFriday, 2 pm\n\nLifestyle\n\nOur picks of the latest dining, travel and leisure options to treat yourself.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThroughout this season, just as I\u2019ve done for years, I gathered with close friends and my children to watch the matches together. Whether it was at a coffeeshop, in someone\u2019s living room, or at the majestic Anfield stadium itself, we celebrated every goal and victory.\n\nOne night, after a particularly hard-earned win, we asked ourselves: What was the secret behind this season\u2019s unexpected success?\n\nKlopp\u2019s replacement in the dugout, the Dutchman Arne Slot, offers a fascinating leadership lesson.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nImperious Liverpool smash Tottenham to win record-tying 20th championship\n\nHe inherited a strong, battle-ready squad. Instead of making sweeping changes like most leaders do once they come into power, he carefully built on what Klopp had so carefully left behind.\n\nSlot\u2019s style of high-energy and possession-driven football fits Liverpool\u2019s players well, and is suited to the heavy demands of the English Premier League.\n\nCrucially, he earned their trust quickly with some impressive wins in the first few weeks of the season. Luck played a crucial role in those early fixtures as Liverpool faced some seemingly easier opponents, but those wins helped to build momentum and confidence \u2013 not just for the players, but for Slot himself.\n\nSlot\u2019s approach was a humble reminder that true leaders honour the past while shaping the future. True change is not destruction, but careful evolution.\n\nWith Slot already exceeding expectations by delivering the Premier League trophy in his maiden season at the club, he is already busy planning for the next challenge, specifically how best to renew his squad.\n\nVeterans like Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah have renewed their contracts, and their commitment to carry on is a huge boost. But the need for renewal remains. Fresh blood must be injected into the team too \u2013 and that is the difficult task ahead.\n\nSlot must decide and figure out how to lead change at Liverpool, without losing any of the club\u2019s identity.\n\nThis lesson holds true beyond football. In any organisation, sustaining success means balancing continuity with renewal. One must be able to introduce change without tearing down what already works, and build new pillars while keeping the old foundations strong.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s ethos \u2013 loyalty, patience and family spirit \u2013 must guide this next chapter too.\n\nThe easy route is to go for quick fixes. But the Liverpool way has always demanded trust, resilience and time.\n\nFor those of us who lived through the barren years (the club went 30 years without a league title until 2020), the taste of success this season is extremely sweet. It also affirms something deeper \u2013 the fact that loyalty and perseverance matter.\n\nAs I stood with my father and children, proudly singing the club\u2019s anthem \u201cYou\u2019ll Never Walk Alone\u201d, I realised that it is not for the trophies alone that we celebrate. It is the journey \u2013 across seasons, and across generations.\n\nThe writer admits that while he is a terrible footballer, he uses the sport to teach his children the values of resilience, loyalty and to never give up\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/6cdb49bb60fcdc9d08d7c9631c003c67eed364fe61fd7d813056e5f3b4b07c6b?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "epa12059484 Liverpool fans wave scarves during the English Premier League soccer match between Liverpool FC and Tottenham Hotspur, in Liverpool, Britain, 27 April 2025.

We never want to become one.\" PHOTO: XPENG MOTORS\n\nLeow Ju-Len\n\nPublished Tue, Apr 29, 2025 \u00b7 06:00 AM\n\n[HONG KONG] Right before He Xiaopeng went on stage to launch the 2025 XPeng X9 car, he battled what he called a \u201cmiserable\u201d cold.\n\n\u201cI slept for 30 out of the past 48 hours. I wanted to be fully energetic to meet all of you,\u201d the co-founder of China\u2019s XPeng Motors told a large crowd of reporters, investors and supporters at an event in Hong Kong on Apr 15.\n\nThat anecdote was a sign of just how important the X9 is to the ambitions of 11-year-old XPeng Motors and He himself. But the futuristic, seven-seat multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) might merely be a Trojan horse for XPeng\u2019s killer weapon in the electric vehicle (EV) market\u2019s next battlefront.\n\nFounded in 2014, XPeng has sold more than 600,000 vehicles since inception, a milestone that serves to underline how the company is still very much a startup. In comparison, market leader BYD takes only two months to sell that many cars.\n\nStill, with 60,158 vehicles delivered in the first quarter of 2025, XPeng is showing signs of building the kind of volume it needs for sustainable growth. It operates in over 30 countries and plans to double its overseas presence to 60 markets, with a goal in place for half its volume to eventually come from outside China.\n\nAt the unveiling \u2013 the brand\u2019s first global car event \u2013 He positioned the X9 as the opening act in what he called a \u201cnew decade\u201d for XPeng, one that will put artificial intelligence (AI) at the centre of the New York and Hong Kong-listed company\u2019s strategy.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nFor two hours, the 47-year-old laid out a case for how AI will underpin everything XPeng does, using the new X9 as a prime example. Engineers updated 35 per cent of its components, but one change mattered more than the rest: a switch from Nvidia\u2019s chips to XPeng\u2019s self-developed Turing AI chip.\n\nThe 40-core processor can run large models with 30 billion parameters locally, meaning without help from the cloud. Mass production is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of 2025 in China, potentially giving XPeng a head start over rivals still reliant on external suppliers for high-performance automotive AI.\n\nXPeng says the chip could give its cars enough self-driving ability to need just one intervention from a human driver every hundred kilometres (once regulations allow that level of autonomy).\n\nAI will also make its cars more energy efficient by learning how drivers behave in different traffic conditions, then adapting the motor responses to suit, or make them more comfortable by using cameras to read the road ahead and tune the suspension for bumps before they hit them.\n\nThe same cameras will also make the AI multi-modal \u2013 if you are curious about the new Mercedes driving ahead of you, for example, you could simply ask your XPeng to identify it and give you the run-down on its performance figures.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nAt Shanghai auto show, EV makers to grapple with autonomous-tech crackdown, launch Tesla \u2018killers\u2019\n\nToyota meets \u2018aggressive\u2019 Apac entry of China carmakers with more EVs \u2013 and combustion engines\n\nEV maker Xpeng charts steady global expansion despite tariff war\n\nIn fact, by forming the technological backbone for a sprawling product ecosystem, the Turing chip could turn out to be XPeng\u2019s real product offering.\n\n\u201cXPeng was never built to be a traditional automaker. We never want to become one,\u201d He said. \u201cWhat really drives us is creating boundary-pushing innovations, whether it\u2019s intelligent driving, AI-powered cars or beyond.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s meant by \u201cbeyond\u201d has so far taken shape as flying cars and humanoid robots, both of them with Turing AI chips for brains.\n\nThe humanoid machines, which XPeng named Iron, are 178 cm tall and weigh 70 kg. They have 60 joints and camera vision and are already on trial in the company\u2019s factories, where they work side-by-side with humans.\n\nHe expects the Turing chip to let an Iron robot figure out problems by itself, instead of mindlessly repeating tasks that programmers set for it.\n\n\u201cIf a robot does not have the intelligence that it\u2019s required to have, it is going to be useless,\u201d he said bluntly.\n\nXPeng\u2019s Land Aircraft Carrier combines a six-wheel electric vehicle with an AI-powered, two-seater flying craft that it stores and recharges. PHOTO: XPENG MOTORS\n\nPerhaps sensibly, AI isn\u2019t intended to make XPeng\u2019s flying car think for itself, but to make it easier to control. At the X9\u2019s launch party, AeroHT \u2013 a startup that became an XPeng subsidiary in 2020 \u2013 showed off the Land Aircraft Carrier, a six-wheeler that comes with a two-seater drone.\n\nThe flying machine fits neatly into the vehicle, which also charges its batteries. The design solves two major headaches that come with owning a traditional helicopter, namely storage and refuelling, according to Tan Wang, who co-founded AeroHT.\n\nAI removes another pain point by making it a breeze to control. Tan told reporters that helicopters are fiendishly hard to fly, but claims that the Turing chip does enough of the heavy lifting that anyone can learn to operate the XPeng in just three minutes. \u201cIn three hours, you would be a master,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Land Aircraft Carrier might seem like a pie-in-the-sky idea, but He said XPeng is on track to start delivering them to customers in 2026.\n\nThe company says it has more than 4,000 pre-orders, at just under two million yuan (S$359,000) each. The target is to sell 10,000 a year, which seems almost outlandishly ambitious, given that no aviation company has ever managed annual sales of more than a thousand.\n\nThe opportunity is significant. The Chinese government elevated the development of the \u201clow-altitude economy\u201d to national priority status for the first time in its 2024 Government Work Report, giving the sector a significant boost. The Civil Aviation Administration of China forecasts that the market could reach 3.5 trillion yuan by 2035.\n\nDespite that, He is measured in his expectations about how quickly his clutch of AI-powered machines could change the way we live, putting the timeline at \u201c10 or 20 years\u201d when asked how long it would take for robots to become ubiquitous.\n\n\u201cWe will have a robot at home and outside we will have robot cars. Flying cars would also be a type of robot. But I think it may take decades of R&D to get us there,\u201d He said.\n\nYet, it\u2019s far from certain if XPeng will survive long enough to participate in that future, let alone create it. Like many startups, it struggles with profitability. It has never run in the black, and in the fourth quarter of 2024 its net loss was 1.33 billion yuan, slightly better than the 1.35 billion yuan loss in the same period of 2023.\n\nWith margins improving and vehicle sales rising, management expects the company to start breaking even by the end of this year. But the founder sounds a cautious note about XPeng\u2019s chances.\n\n\u201cI believe that the next decade will witness very brutal competition in China, and I believe that ultimately, we will have only five to seven carmakers left,\u201d He said. \u201cRight now, we are ranked seventh, so there\u2019s a long way to go.\u201d\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWhat's moving the markets?

Now it has become almost a feature of venture capital's investing process. PHOTO: PIXABAY\n\nPublished Mon, Apr 28, 2025 \u00b7 06:19 PM\n\nVENTURE capital (VC) investing should be relatively simple: You hand money to a new company to help it grow in exchange for a stake in the business. After a few years, once it is established and able to turn a profit, you sell your interest in an initial public offering (IPO) or a buyout, yielding a multiple of your original outlay.\n\nRecently, however, the VC business model has come under strain. It is taking longer than in the past for startups to scale up and turn profitable. And even when they do, some founders choose to keep their business private as they find the potential valuation boost that comes with an IPO is not worth the additional scrutiny required for a public listing.\n\nThe result is that a lot of VC fund managers are having to wait longer to capitalise on their investments, repay their own backers and plough cash back into other promising opportunities.\n\nThose who prefer not to hold off have been turning to the \u201csecondary\u201d market, a venue for buying and selling stakes in a growing array of private companies. The market has existed in some form since the late 1970s, but has mushroomed lately. An estimated US$122 billion in assets are expected to change hands on the secondary market in 2025, up from US$25 billion in 2012, said VC firm Industry Ventures.\n\nIn the past, the secondary market was seen as a last resort and a rather expensive option for investors to offload stakes in a hurry. Now it has become almost a feature of the VC investing process. Sam Lawson, a founding partner at Flywheel Capital, said the idea of buyers on the secondary market as mostly distressed-asset investors is an outdated stereotype.\n\nBut dealings on the secondary market remain opaque, and largely unregulated, throwing up an array of risks for those involved.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nWhat\u2019s the point of the secondary market?\n\nVenture capital firms are managed by so-called general partners (GPs), who raise money from investors known as limited partners (LPs). These can include endowments, wealthy individuals or pension funds. The GPs invest the funds in nascent businesses, most often technology companies, in the hope of backing the next Uber or Airbnb.\n\nThe secondary market allows company founders, their employees and investors to cash out some of their equity without needing to wait for an eventual IPO or corporate buyout. For buyers, it is an opportunity to acquire a slice of a promising company that is not currently raising funds.\n\nHow did this secondary market come about?\n\nWhile there is no official literature documenting the first secondary transaction, it is widely accepted by secondary market participants that industry veteran Dayton Carr pioneered the trade by acquiring the LP interests of various venture funds from IBM in 1979, said a report by Industry Ventures.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nWhy American tech stocks are newly vulnerable\n\nCarr went on to found VCFA (Venture Capital Funds of America) Group, a New York-based firm that buys interests in private equity and venture capital funds, in 1982.\n\nWhy is the secondary market growing so rapidly?\n\nVenture capitalists wrote large cheques at record speed between 2020 and 2021, leading to sky-high valuations and unprecedented deal activity. The tide turned in 2022 as central banks raised interest rates to combat inflation, and the IPO market slammed shut. The amount raised in IPOs worldwide tumbled to US$146 billion in 2024 from a peak of US$641 billion in 2021, indicated data compiled by Bloomberg, and VCs have been forced to prolong their investment timescales beyond the 10 years that were once typical in the industry.\n\nAs a result, GPs have been resorting to the secondary market to generate the returns they need to keep their LPs on side. The secondary market is also a useful option for founders and their early employees to cash out or to grant new investors access to the company.\n\nOften the business being sold has established a successful operating model and is focused on expanding its operations \u2013 known as a scale-up. Companies such as Stripe, SpaceX and Databricks have all facilitated secondary sales on behalf of employees who want to cash out their shares. A secondary sale can be more appealing than a sale of new stock, known as a primary fundraising, as it does not dilute the value of the existing share capital.\n\nWhere is this market exactly, and how does it work?\n\nThere is no single place, or even a single digital platform, for secondary sales. Big private companies often use banks to organise tender offers and deal with buyers on their behalf. Alternatively, online platforms such as Nasdaq Private Market can do the work of identifying interested participants.\n\nShareholders of private companies can also buy and sell stock to other investors. Platforms such as Forge Global and Zanbato allow users to buy and sell stakes in private companies, though participants need to be either accredited investors or ultra-high net worth individuals.\n\nLPs can use the secondary market to sell stakes in the VC funds themselves. The buyers are typically other funds focused on acquiring assets through the secondary market, such as HarbourVest and Coller Capital, or other LPs.\n\nGPs are also using the secondary market to offload stakes via so-called \u201ccontinuation funds\u201d. Here, an investment vehicle is created with money from a new investor and a VC fund\u2019s assets are transferred to the new entity, with LPs given the option of cashing out. Because existing portfolios are being rolled into a new fund, these are seen as secondary market deals.\n\nMost secondary transactions are straightforward sales of equity or fund interests at a discount to their most recent valuation. More specialist funds are doing \u201cstructured\u201d deals in which, instead of a simple buy-sell agreement, custom deal terms are negotiated. Some of the more common structured transactions include deferral deals, meaning parts of the payment to the seller are delayed or contingent on the future performance of the asset, or forward contract deals, where buyers agree to buy shares at a future date on pre-agreed terms.\n\nWhat are the risks?\n\nDespite the secondary market\u2019s growing importance, it remains relatively opaque, with little regulatory oversight in comparison with public markets. The value of deals is small in comparison with trades on stock exchanges, which offer investors far more liquidity and price visibility.\n\nWith private companies subject to far fewer disclosure requirements than public ones, secondary buyers have limited access to data on a firm\u2019s financial performance. They might not be fully aware of the company\u2019s challenges or any fundraising plans that might affect its valuation. So agreeing on the price of a secondary market sale can be a fraught and drawn-out process.\n\nEven when a buyer and seller settle on a price, the deal can be blocked by the company or stalled as another party might have a \u201cright of first refusal\u201d over the shares. Tom Callahan, chief executive officer of Nasdaq Private Market, estimated that one-third of direct trades are affected in this way.\n\nWhat is the role of regulators in the secondary market?\n\nFinancial regulators in the UK have talked for years about establishing a platform attached to the London Stock Exchange for trading shares in private companies. The plan, known as Pisces, is yet to take shape.\n\nUS venture funds are largely exempt from regulatory oversight as long as they observe restrictions on their investments \u2013 devoting at least 80 per cent of fund assets to \u201cqualifying\u201d investments (equity securities that are purchased directly from private companies) and less than 20 per cent on \u201cnon-qualifying\u201d assets, such as shares purchased on the secondary market.\n\nRecently, more VC firms have been registering with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, exposing them to greater oversight and obliging them to make regulatory filings to the agency, so that they can breach the 20 per cent limit on assets acquired via secondary transactions.\n\nThe urge to do so has only grown since US President Donald Trump unleashed a tariff war, sending shock waves through financial markets and forcing private companies such as buy-now-pay-later firm Klarna and online ticket vendor StubHub to pause their IPO preparations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re expecting our secondaries team to become increasingly active, as the secondary market remains one of the few viable paths to liquidity,\u201d said Mitchell Green, chief executive of Lead Edge Capital.

He mentions how the Teo family, particularly through the efforts of Teo brothers Thye Chor and Thye Hong, started accumulating land in the 1950s. This move capitalised on post-World War II rebuilding efforts in Singapore, laying the foundation for the family\u2019s extensive real estate empire.\n\nTeo, the director of Daniel Teo group of companies and a third-generation leader, provides a personal glimpse into her experiences growing up in a family deeply entrenched in the real estate business. Her recounting of childhood memories, such as being taken on property site visits by her grandfather and father, brings a human element to the story.\n\nPassion for investments\n\nTeo candidly shares her journey, including the decision to join the family business instead of pursuing architecture due to her grades.

First Sponsor remains cautiously optimistic that further government support this year will contribute to a gradual market recovery.\n\nThe European property portfolio saw a dip in operating income to 7.8 million euros (S$11.6 million) in Q1 2025, from 7.9 million euros in the same period in the previous year. This was driven mainly by the major renovation of Le Meridien Frankfurt. The completion of the redevelopment of Puccini Hotel Milan and Prins Hendrikkade Amsterdam as well as the renovation of Le Meridien Frankfurt are expected to enhance the recurring income from the European property portfolio.\n\nThe Chinese hotel portfolio saw revenue fall 14 per cent to 15.6 million yuan (S$2.8 million) in Q1 2025 from 18.1 million yuan in Q1 2024. This was due to challenging economic conditions in China persisting in the recent quarter leading to lower demand from the meetings and events segments, resulting in lower occupancy rates.\n\nLegal action\n\nThe company had also commenced legal action in Shanghai against a borrower to recover an outstanding loan principal of 375.8 million yuan. The loan is related to a completed residential project in the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, comprising 140 apartments and 1,070 square metres of commercial space, as well as seven low-rise buildings with 28 loft apartments.\n\nSubsequently, First Sponsor entered into a settlement agreement with the borrower which includes a first payment of 165.3 million yuan, together with 4.7 million yuan received previously.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nFirst Sponsor H2 net profit jumps more than 40 times to S$81.1 million\n\nFirst Sponsor to increase stake in Netherlands\u2019 NSI for 18.9 million euros\n\nA final payment of 232.2 million yuan and associated default interest accrued at 14.6 per cent per annum is due on Jun 6.

PHOTO: YEN MENG JIIN, BT\n\n[SINGAPORE] On the sixth day of GE2025 campaigning on Monday (Apr 28), three parties are holding rallies from 7pm to 10pm tonight, after this afternoon\u2019s rally in the central business district.\n\nThe People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) is holding three evening rallies, while the Singapore Democratic Party and Workers\u2019 Party (WP) have one each.\n\nScroll down for their locations and timings, along with livestream links to watch them online.\n\nPAP: PM Wong holds first lunchtime rally\n\nEarlier today, the PAP held this election\u2019s first lunchtime rally at the promenade near UOB Plaza.\n\nTraditionally known as\n\nthe Fullerton rally\n\n, it drew a crowd of office workers to hear Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, alongside Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office Indranee Rajah and seven PAP newcomers:\n\nBernadette Giam\n\nDavid Hoe\n\nDavid Neo\n\nGoh Hanyan\n\nHazlina Abdul Halim\n\nJagathishwaran Rajo\n\nSyed Harun Alhabsyi, former Nominated Member of Parliament\n\nIn case you missed it, here\u2019s our\n\nlivestream of the rally\n\nto rewatch at your leisure.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nAt the rally, PM Wong said that\n\nthe vote for the opposition is not a \u201cfree vote for more alternative voices\u201d\n\n, but a vote to weaken the PAP team.\n\nOpposition wins could cause the loss of three or four ministers, which would weaken not just the government but also the country, at an already challenging time, he said.\n\nThe current economic turbulence \u201cis not a passing storm\u201d, he warned. \u201cThis storm will test us, and if we are not careful, we could lose everything that we have worked so hard to build here in Singapore.\u201d\n\nIf the PAP earns a weak mandate in GE2025, bigger countries might be temped to push Singapore around, he added.\n\nApart from economic pressures, here\u2019s what he said on other issues:\n\nOn goods and services tax hikes:\n\n\u201cThe opposition wants foreigners, tourists and higher-income families to pay a lower rate of GST. Would you? I wouldn\u2019t. I think it\u2019s fair and right of them to pay the full rate. But for lower and middle income Singaporeans \u2013 we protect you, we shield you, we give you permanent GST vouchers in cash, which means you pay an effectively lower GST rate.\u201d\n\nOn the opposition\u2019s idea of a minimum wage: \u201c\n\nIt sounds good on paper. But if we implement this by law, companies will have to pay more for their workers. Your costs will go up. Companies can only recover it by raising prices on the goods and services they sell to Singaporeans. So how does this solve cost of living pressures?\u201d Instead, there are existing policies such as the Workfare Income Supplement and Progressive Wage Model, he said.\n\nOn opposition manifestos:\n\n\u201cTheir manifestos have many details, (and are) a long wish list, but are they feasible, viable and sustainable? Will there be negative outcomes? Please think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf something sounds too good to be true, it probably is too good to be true. There is no such thing as a free lunch.\u201d\n\nWP: Rebuttals on Income-Allianz\n\nAt a media doorstop this morning, WP chief Pritam Singh disagreed with Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong\u2019s claim that the\n\naborted deal between NTUC Income and Allianz\n\nwould have gone through had the WP been in charge.\n\nAt a rally on Sunday, SM Lee noted that WP MPs had abstained from voting on a bill to block the German insurer\u2019s bid for a controlling stake in Income. This was after Singh said, on Saturday, that no labour MP had spoken up about the deal.\n\nOn Monday, Singh said that SM Lee had sidestepped his point. Although six PAP MPs and one WP MP questioned the deal, the ratio of PAP MPs to WP MPs is about nine to one, he said.\n\nSM Lee had characterised the issue as if the WP were in charge \u2013 \u201cbut we weren\u2019t\u201d, he added.\n\nThe WP secretary-general added that even if all 26 WP candidates were voted into Parliament, the government would still have enough leeway to deal with issues of the day.\n\nToday\u2019s election rally sites:\n\nToday\u2019s rally livestreams:\n\nPeople\u2019s Action Party (Jalan Besar GRC)\n\n* lunchtime Fullerton rally\n\nPeople\u2019s Action Party (Jurong Central SMC)\n\nPeople\u2019s Action Party (Pasir Ris-Changi GRC)\n\nPeople\u2019s Action Party (Sembawang GRC)\n\nSingapore Democratic Party (Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC)\n\nWorkers\u2019 Party (Punggol GRC)\n\nFor more election coverage, visit our\n\nGE2025 microsite\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

PHOTO: TAY CHU YI, BT\n\n[SINGAPORE] In this column on Mar 31, I advocated that\n\nOCBC\n\nshould sell its Chulia and Church Street properties so that the assets can be redeveloped to create a new prime office project in the heart of the Central Business District (CBD). Divesting these buildings will also help create shareholder value.\n\nMy\n\nsuggestion\n\nthat OCBC should consider selling the trio of buildings it owns at 63 and 65 Chulia Street and 18 Church Street has been rejected. At its annual general meeting (AGM) on Apr 17, chairman Andrew Lee said OCBC has no plans to sell its CBD properties including OCBC Centre, which holds heritage value for the lender.\n\nStill, if OCBC wants to retain the said properties, I maintain that it should redevelop the trio of buildings soon in a prudent manner. The lender can work with a financially strong property group, which has strong project-execution capabilities in integrated development.\n\nLocated at 65 Chulia Street, OCBC Centre was completed in 1976. OCBC Centre East and OCBC Centre South occupy 63 Chulia Street and 18 Church Street, respectively.\n\nOCBC Centre sits on freehold land, while the two neighbouring buildings sit on leasehold land with about 42 years remaining. The lender\u2019s head office and various operations are housed in the OCBC Centre cluster of buildings.\n\nAt the Apr 17 AGM, chairman Lee highlighted OCBC Centre\u2019s historical significance, noting that it sits on the same site where the bank was founded in 1932. He said \u201cthat site, that building, has a lot of history, has a lot of emotion for us, as the oldest continuing bank in Singapore\u201d.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nTuesday, 12 pm\n\nProperty Insights\n\nGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nIn April 2024, OCBC announced that it was exploring the redevelopment of the Chulia and Church Street properties. However, the lender said in February that redevelopment plans will be put on hold.\n\nAt the AGM, Lee noted that construction costs are currently elevated and that redevelopment plans possibly amount to S$4 billion to S$5 billion. He questioned if this was the right time to undertake such a massive project, which will strain the bank\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nIn context, I had argued that Singapore loses out if the OCBC Centre cluster of buildings is not redeveloped. Redevelopment might yield a new landmark Grade A office-led integrated development with leading retail and hospitality components that enhances a historic part of Singapore\u2019s CBD.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nOCBC Centre is \u2018anchor\u2019 for the bank; no plans to sell heritage site: board chairman\n\nOCBC should sell Chulia Street properties so assets can be redeveloped to benefit Singapore\n\nOccupying a combined area of more than 120,000 square feet (sq ft) of land near the Singapore River, the redevelopment project\u2019s total gross floor area may top 1.8 million sq ft if it has a plot ratio of 15 times.\n\nI suggested that if OCBC did not want to redevelop the said buildings, it could sell the buildings instead.\n\nSure, OCBC is accountable to shareholders and may rightly avoid doing the nation a service by redeveloping the said trio of buildings should it be unconvinced of the financial merit in doing so.\n\nHowever, is OCBC short-changing its shareholders by not letting a third party acquire the Chulia and Church Street properties with an eye to carrying out redevelopment?\n\nAfter all, selling the properties might help the bank crystallise the benefit from an uplift in land value due to intensification in use of the assets as not all of the increase in land value is eaten up by paying land betterment charge.\n\nUndertaking redevelopment with a partner\n\nImportantly, a creative way should be found to redevelop the OCBC Centre cluster of buildings without straining OCBC\u2019s balance sheet, while allowing the bank to continue operating out of Chulia Street and have ownership interest in the said properties.\n\nOCBC can partner a credible property player to develop the trio of properties. The said partner can take equity interest in the property development project and the completed development.\n\nUpon completing, say, a development with office, retail and hospitality components, OCBC and the real estate partner can jointly own the office and retail components, while the partner solely owns the hospitality component.\n\nWorking with the right property partner can significantly mitigate the project execution and financial risks of redeveloping the Chulia and Church Street buildings.\n\nPossibly, OCBC has not as yet found a partner on terms that it is happy with. Still, leveraging its talent, OCBC should be able to secure a suitable partner and structure a good deal that best protects its interest, especially as core Singapore property assets command a premium, in an increasingly uncertain world.\n\nMoreover, with careful planning, disruption to staff in the buildings affected by redevelopment can be minimised. And the bank\u2019s other properties such as the Bank of Singapore and Great Eastern buildings in the CBD, and a new building coming up in the Punggol Digital District could help house staff affected by redevelopment works.\n\nBuilding a new landmark\n\nDesigned by the late acclaimed American architect IM Pei, OCBC Centre exemplifies brutalist architecture. Brutalist buildings have a minimalist construction style, showcasing the bare building materials and structural elements over decorative design.\n\nGiven OCBC Centre\u2019s architectural importance and sustainability considerations, redeveloping the Chulia and Church Street properties can possibly include conserving OCBC Centre.\n\nLook, for example, at how the mixed-use development project Golden Mile Singapore along Beach Road incorporates refreshing the conserved Golden Mile Complex.\n\nMany leading businesses today see merit in having great work spaces, which help a business\u2019 branding.\n\nCrucially, having premier work spaces gives a business an edge in drawing talent. Also, great work spaces provide a conducive environment for staff to collaborate and co-create.\n\nThink of a redeveloped OCBC Centre cluster of buildings with conserved elements, a great design, large floor plates, different components that are seamlessly connected, strong green credentials, biophilic elements and recreational spaces that provide a best-in-class working environment.\n\nSure, the bank\u2019s board and management have to deal with a challenging economic environment and fierce competition.\n\nFurthermore, Lee said at the AGM: \u201cWe are a bank, not a property developer, so if we have sufficient space, we do not need to redevelop more property than we need.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, optimising value from valuable prime real estate matters. By getting structuring right and working with a competent partner, redevelopment can potentially be carried out without over-straining OCBC\u2019s balance sheet and with risks well managed.\n\nUltimately, not redeveloping the OCBC Centre cluster of buildings wastes an opportunity to help rejuvenate a historic part of the CBD as well as a chance for OCBC to create value from the properties and provide its staff exciting new work spaces.\n\n(The writer holds shares in OCBC)\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Net interest cost, excluding amortised establishment costs, had risen 18.3 per cent to 9.4 million euros, from 7.9 million euros in the corresponding period last year.\n\nThis came from higher borrowings in the quarter following a bond issuance, as well as higher all-in interest rates \u2013 3.66 per cent in Q1, from 3.13 per cent in the same period the year before, said the manager.\n\nThe Reit\u2019s net asset value (NAV) consequently fell 2.5 per cent to 1.98 euros per unit, from 2.03 euros per unit, following the H2 2024 distribution paid in March.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nIts net gearing inched up to 41.7 per cent as at Mar 31, with an interest coverage ratio of 3.3 times.\n\nIts weighted average debt expiry stood at 4.1 years, and weighted average lease expiry at 5.2 years \u2013 the longest in the Reit\u2019s history, with nine of the top 10 tenant-customer leases now expiring beyond 2030, said Simon Garing, chief executive of the manager.\n\nHe added that the trust is trading on a yield of around 9 per cent, underpinned by a strengthening euro currency and an around 25 per cent discount to NAV per unit.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nStoneweg European Reit secures lease renewals with Motorola and Coolblue\n\nStoneweg E-Reit manager unveils proposed conversion to stapled group\n\nGaring said: \u201cWe continue to view (its) investment proposition as compelling, reflected in the board\u2019s decision to commence a unit buyback during the current heightened volatility.\n\n\u201cWe are actively taking strategic steps within (the Reit\u2019s) portfolio to unlock value, generate alpha and catalyse positive unit price performance to close the gap to NAV per unit.\u201d\n\nIn a separate bourse filing hours before, SERT announced that it had signed a 20-year lease renewal with NN Group for Haagse Poort, a distinctive-looking office building in the Central Business District of The Hague in the Netherlands.\n\nThe Reit said this lease renewal will be effective no later than December 2027, subject to municipality approvals.\n\nThe manager of SERT also signed a cooperation agreement with NN Group, its largest tenant, for asset enhancements of the building. Planned improvements include the addition of two atria, which add 2,500 sq m to the net leasable area of the building. The improvements will also make the building climate-neutral and energy-efficient.\n\nAndreas Hoffmann, chief investment officer of the Reit\u2019s manager, said: \u201cHaagse Poort will become a leading prime office asset for energy efficiency in the Netherlands, offering high-quality amenities for NN Group employees.\u201d\n\nUnits of SERT closed 2.3 per cent higher or S$0.05 to S$2.21 on Monday.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWhat's moving the markets?

This was mainly from a net reversal for an impairment loss on trade receivables, following a successful collection from a certain credit impaired tenant, it said.\n\nThe rupiah\u2019s depreciation also resulted in a marginal 0.2 per cent drop in rental revenue to S$27.5 million in Q1, said the manager.\n\nMeanwhile, revenue rose 1.4 per cent to S$49.9 million in Q1, from S$49.2 million in the corresponding period last year. It was driven primarily by a 67.4 per cent jump in car park income, following the trust\u2019s entry into a new car park management arrangement.\n\nNo distribution was declared for the quarter.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThe trust had previously announced it would cease distributions to the holders of its S$140 million and S$120 million perpetual securities in a bid to conserve cash.\n\nOn Monday, the manager noted that the \u201cmaturity issues\u201d of previous refinancing exercises have been \u201csubstantially\u201d addressed, with the group working to reduce its debt. But its non-restricted cash and cash equivalents decreased to S$17.2 million as at Mar 31, from S$20 million at the end of December 2024.\n\nThe manager added that global and domestic economic uncertainties remain elevated, and may continue to cause a persistently high interest rate and volatile foreign exchange environment.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nIndonesia\u2019s layoff crisis deepens as factories shut; growth hangs in the balance\n\nLMIRT could fail to meet minimum interest coverage ratio for FY2024, expects no financial consequences\n\nIndonesia\u2019s housing market poised for growth amid tax break extension\n\nThe inflationary effects of recent tariff measures and geopolitical tensions could also affect the retail environment, it said. \u201cWith these uncertainties persisting, the potential impacts remain uncertain and could negatively affect the sustainability of LMIRT\u2019s existing capital structure, its leverage ratio, credit ratings, (its) access to capital and its ability to maintain compliance with financial covenants.\u201d\n\nUntil the trust\u2019s financial and cashflow positions improve, the manager said, distributions to both unitholders and holders of its perpetual securities will continue to be withheld.\n\nFor the quarter, the trust\u2019s average portfolio occupancy edged up to 82.2 per cent, from 81.2 per cent at the end of December 2024. This was underpinned by 41,971 square metres of new lease commitments, said the manager\u2019s chief executive officer James Liew.\n\nWeighted average lease expiry by net lettable area stood at 2.9 years as at Mar 31, with an average rental reversion of 3.9 per cent and renewal rate of 79 per cent.\n\nShopper traffic continued to recover in the quarter, up 7.4 per cent to 32.8 million shoppers. Liew attributed the improvement to the trust\u2019s diversified tenant mix, with increasing emphasis on food and beverage, leisure and entertainment sectors to align with evolving consumer preferences.\n\n\u201cIn 2025, we will continue to actively execute a phased series of asset enhancement initiatives across our portfolio, designed to elevate shopper experience, optimise space utilisation and align with the requirements of our tenants,\u201d said Liew.\n\nAt the same time, he said, the group will manage capital carefully, making its monthly principal repayments and redeeming the remaining US dollar bonds due in February 2026. As at Mar 31, the trust\u2019s gearing stood at a \u201cstable\u201d 44.2 per cent.\n\nUnits of the trust closed flat at S$0.013 on Monday, before the announcement.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWhat's moving the markets?

The outcome is likely to be a more balanced global economy, with Europe and Asia shouldering more responsibilities for driving growth and maintaining peace, but where the US economy remains \u201cfirst among equals\u201d. Investors need to adjust their portfolios to reflect this nuanced shift, and not overreact.\n\nSince US President Donald Trump took charge of the world\u2019s largest economy on Jan 21, the benchmark US 10-year government bond yield is down by over 25 basis points, oil has declined over 15 per cent and, crucially, the US dollar has depreciated almost 6 per cent against its major trade partners. That\u2019s arguably a remarkable achievement in the first 100 days of office, given a core plank of Trump 2.0 is lowering bond yields, boosting energy supplies and making the dollar more competitive.\n\nAlthough the benchmark S&P 500 stock index is down more than 10 per cent over the same period, Trump has waved it away as \u201cshort-term pain\u201d necessary to achieve his long-term objective. Trump 2.0\u2019s avowed goal is to rebalance the global economic and financial order by reducing the world\u2019s addiction to the US\u2019 unsustainably debt-fuelled consumption, forcing Europe and China to boost internal investment and consumption, respectively, and attracting more durable investment into US manufacturing sector to revive the fortunes of the American middle class.\n\nShift in global behaviour\n\nWhile the execution of these goals can be questioned \u2013 whether the unconventional execution also part of the plan of a self-confessed disruptor \u2013 there are already signs of significant shifts in foreign government and corporate behaviour. German policymakers bypassed established parliamentary norms to rapidly cobble together a two-thirds majority in the outgoing parliament and approve a generational shift in fiscal policy to boost defence and infrastructure spending. China has embarked on fiscal stimulus to boost domestic consumption and is likely to do more.\n\nMajor trade partners, with the main exception of China, are queuing up to negotiate trade deals with the US administration. Opec has reversed years of oil production curbs to boost supplies. Meanwhile, global companies, from Hyundai and Posco to Roche and Toyota, have pledged tens of billions of dollars of investment into manufacturing plants in the US.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nPrimacy of the US consumer\n\nThe underlying driver of these shifts in behaviour is simple. The US is by far the world\u2019s largest consumer market. US household spending totalled US$19 trillion in 2023, double that of the European Union and almost three times that of China. While this insatiable US consumption has been fuelled by years of excessive fiscal stimulus \u2013 which is likely to be curtailed if Trump 2.0 works as planned \u2013 the primacy of the US consumer is unlikely to disappear anytime soon.\n\nIt is the American consumer\u2019s power that allows global companies to sell the same goods in the US at profit margins multiple times those in Asia, or even Europe. The Trump team is strategically leveraging this unmatched consumer power to get better deals (terms of trade) for the US. This explains why global manufacturers are lining up to build plants in the US to get closer to this consumer base and for governments to cut deals with the US.\n\nMeanwhile, US tariffs are projected to annually raise on average US$500 billion of revenue for the government over the next 10 years, helping to reduce the budget deficit, according to University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School Budget Model, notwithstanding the 6 per cent and 5 per cent long-term hit to US GDP and wages, respectively.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nAsia gains lead in race for interim deals to avoid Trump tariffs\n\nFrom rubber ducks to 401(k)s, Trump voters feel tariff pain but most see long-term gain\n\nSingapore-headquartered Shein hikes US prices as much as 377% ahead of tariff spikes\n\nPrivate sector-led growth\n\nHowever, one could argue that a short-term cooling of the economy fuelled by unsustainable government spending is necessary. As Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent explained: \u201cThe American economy has been artificially propped up by government spending and public sector job growth. We are focused on transitioning back to a private sector-powered economy \u2013 one where businesses drive job creation, investment and innovation.\u201d\n\nThe administration plans to extend individual tax cuts initially enacted in Trump 1.0 and which expire this year, cut corporate taxes, deregulate the banking sector and incentivise investment in small businesses through tax deductions and easing of unnecessary reporting burden. The aim is to boost the economy\u2019s productivity, which should sustainably lift growth and wages.\n\nThe economic implication of this strategy is as nuanced as the strategy itself. If Trump 2.0 proceeds as planned, there could be an increased risk of a short-term economic downturn in the latter half of the year, caused by disruptions to trade and a short-term hit to consumer and business confidence.\n\nHowever, it would be prudent for investors to look through this downturn because the US policy focus will shift in the coming months towards negotiating trade deals, and then towards long-term growth-supportive measures such as tax cuts and deregulation.\n\nThere are signs of this shift happening. Bessent reportedly told a private audience that the current 145 per cent US tariff on imports from China are unsustainable. This was followed by Trump stating that the tariff on China will be reduced \u201csubstantially\u201d and a tariff deal could happen \u201cpretty quickly\u201d. Trump has already paused reciprocal tariffs against other trade partners for 90 days.\n\nInvestment implications\n\nFor investors, overreacting to short-term policy moves could prove costly for long-term wealth generation. This was recently experienced by those who exited the market as US equity markets corrected, and the bond market volatility surged after the tariffs were imposed on Apr 2. By staying out of the market, these investors missed the biggest single-day surge in US stocks since 2008 when the reciprocal tariffs were paused a week later.\n\nThere is a case to be made for resizing one\u2019s asset allocation by reducing the share of equities, especially US stocks, in the portfolio as growth slows, earnings potentially broaden out to Europe and Asia, and the US dollar weakens to reflect the global rebalancing. US and European government bonds should do well in an economic downturn.\n\nThere are also bargains opening in emerging market assets as businesses re-orientate supply chains to align with the new world order. However, missing the woods for the trees by focusing on short-term noise and selling US assets lock, stock and barrel, could undermine long-term returns.\n\nThe writer is senior investment strategist at Standard Chartered Bank\u2019s wealth solutions chief investment office\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Wealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/ce8a1590f0e440bc89aa879c8088336b9deae12ba8237407254d7f971cb1811d?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "A woman carries shopping bags in Manhattan in New York City, U.S., February 25, 2025.

It spans 26 acres (10.5 hectares) and replaces two older facilities.\n\nThe terminal will include an advanced truck dock management system to help manage the flow of goods in and out of the facility. It uses real-time scheduling, automatic check-ins and digital communication between drivers and dock workers. This not only cuts wait times and congestion, but also reduces noise and emissions in the area, said the three.\n\nThe facility is also JFK\u2019s first dedicated facility for temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals and perishables, with 3,000 sq ft of cooler space.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nOn top of that, it features electric forklifts, electric vehicle chargers and an automated united load device system to optimise power usage.\n\nMike Simpson, WFS gateway services chief executive officer for Americas, said the new cargo terminal marks a new era for the company at one of the main gateways in the US.\n\n\u201cThe facility embodies our dedication to connecting the world through logistics, and embraces new levels of digitalisation and sustainability that will act as a model for other new cargo operations around the world,\u201d he said.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nSats appoints new group CFO as part of leadership renewal\n\nSats unit bags 5 year contract with Emirates SkyCargo at Frankfurt Airport\n\nSats JV to upgrade Marina Bay Cruise Centre, gets extension for terminal operator agreement\n\nPort Authority chairman Kevin O\u2019Toole added that the facility is a \u201ccritical investment in the infrastructure that powers the regional and national economy\u201d in the US. Currently, the JFK air cargo sector supports more than 93,000 jobs and generates US$11.4 billion in economic activity annually.\n\n\u201cThis modern cargo terminal strengthens (JFK\u2019s) position as a key gateway for high-value goods and international trade,\u201d he said.\n\nSats stock closed flat at S$2.81 on Monday, before the news.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWhat's moving the markets?

It did not say China was occupying the feature.\n\nCCTV showed pictures of four coast guard personnel in black combat gear holding a Chinese flag after arriving on Sandy Cay on an inflatable dinghy.\n\nPhilippine National Security Council spokesperson Jonathan Malaya on Monday said news reports of China seizing Sandy Cay were false as a Philippine team had visited the sandbars on Sunday and found nobody there.\n\n\u201cThe facts on the ground belie their statements,\u201d Malaya said.\n\n\u201cWe are here to debunk that and to assure the public that we have not lost the Pagasa Cays,\u201d Malaya said using the Filipino name for the sandbars, calling the reports \u201cirresponsible\u201d.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nTies between China and the US ally the Philippines are significantly strained amid heated spats over disputed parts of the South China Sea, where Beijing has deployed an armada of coast guard to reinforce its claim to sovereignty over almost the entire waterway.\n\nThe Philippines is vexed by the conduct and permanent presence in its exclusive economic zone of China\u2019s coast guard and what it considers a militia of fishing vessels under its control. Sandy Cay is close to Thitu Island, the largest and most strategically important of the nine features Manila occupies in the Spratly archipelago, where Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan and China also have a presence, ranging from reefs and rocks to islands, natural and artificial.\n\nChina\u2019s manmade islands include runways, ports and missile systems.\n\nThe Philippines on Sunday said it observed near Thitu Island what it called the illegal presence of Chinese coast guard and militia vessels. China\u2019s coast guard responded by calling the Philippine presence unlawful.\n\nThe security council\u2019s Malaya urged China to show restraint to prevent an escalation, reminding Beijing it was bound by a 2002 deal with its South-east Asian neighbours, which included a mutual agreement not to occupy more uninhabited features.\n\nThe latest trading of barbs comes as both the Philippines and China accuse each other of espionage and disinformation, further fuelling diplomatic tensions. The Philippines is investigating allegations by its security council that Chinese state-sponsored groups may be attempting to influence the outcome of next moth\u2019s mid-term election, which Beijing has rejected.

One will be a green data centre developed by US investors, while the other is an artificial intelligence data centre by local construction firm Gamuda Bhd, he said on Monday (Apr 28).\n\nThe data centres were drawn to the state\u2019s ability to meet their infrastructure requirements and its good highway network, Aminuddin said. Negeri Sembilan is located on Malaysia\u2019s southwest coast, and is about an hour\u2019s drive from Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe data-centre boom is spilling over to Negeri Sembilan, with Malaysia\u2019s southern state of Johor slowing the pace of approvals amid concerns that the facilities were putting a strain on its resources. The spurt helped investments in Johor climb 12 per cent to RM48.5 billion (S$14.6 billion) last year.\n\nAminuddin said Gamuda will construct and develop a water treatment plant with a capacity of 67 million litres (17.7 million gallons) per day to ensure sufficient supply for areas surrounding the data centres. The state government will carefully assess future data centre proposals given their high water needs, he added.\n\nEarthworks have already begun on both projects, which are expected to create high-quality job opportunities, increase investment and tax revenue, said Aminuddin.

Try and plan another year down the road. I mean, who knows what it looks like, let alone five years down the road,\u201d James Rossiter, head of global macro strategy at TD Securities, said.\n\nFaced with heightened uncertainties and century-high duties on goods, many global businesses have either withdrawn or cut revenue forecasts.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nShowing an uncommon unanimity, none of the more than 300 economists polled April 1-28 said tariffs had a positive impact on business sentiment, with 92 per cent saying negative. Only 8 per cent said neutral, mostly from India and other emerging economies.\n\nThree-quarters of economists cut their 2025 global growth forecast, bringing the median to 2.7 per cent from 3.0 per cent in a January poll. The International Monetary Fund was a tad higher at 2.8 per cent.\n\nIndividual economies surveyed showed a similar trend with median forecasts cut for 28 of the 48 economies polled.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nFor Trump, it\u2019s all going as planned\n\nAmong the others, for 10 economies the consensus view was unchanged and for 10, including Argentina and Spain, the view was slightly upgraded from the previous poll based mainly on domestic developments.\n\nThe split for 2026 was nearly the same, suggesting the current downtrend in growth expectations that started with Trump imposing tariffs is deep and not an easy one to fix.\n\nAsked about the risk of a global recession this year, a 60 per cent majority \u2013 101 of 167 \u2013 said it was high or very high.

It represents a premium of 27 per cent over Amara\u2019s closing price of S$0.705 on Apr 23 before the company called for a trading halt the following day.\n\nThe S$0.895 offer price also represents a 42.1 per cent, 44.8 per cent, 46.7 per cent and 48.9 per cent premium over Amara\u2019s volume-weighted average price for the one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month periods up to and including the last traded day, respectively.\n\nThe offeror has obtained irrevocable undertakings from a group of Amara shareholders, with a combined stake of 90.58 per cent, to vote in favour of the deal. The group includes Amethyst Assets, which, in 2023,\n\nproposed to privatise Amara\n\n.\n\nIf the group accepts the proposal, the acceptance condition will be satisfied and the S$0.895-apiece offer will become unconditional.\n\nThe offeror, a special-purpose vehicle called DRC Investments, intends to privatise Amara, it said, citing low trading liquidity and challenging macroeconomic conditions.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nTuesday, 12 pm\n\nProperty Insights\n\nGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nDRC Investments includes a 35 per cent stake held by a fund sponsored by Hwa Hong and Malaysia-based Newfields. It is also 30 per cent owned by Albertsons Capital, whose shareholders are Albert Teo, Amara\u2019s chairman and chief executive, and his daughter Dawn Teo, Amara\u2019s chief operating officer.\n\nWing Tai\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, Winteam Investment, also holds a 35 per cent stake in the consortium.\n\nThe S$0.895 offer represents a 33 per cent premium over Amara\u2019s net asset value per share as at end-December 2024.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nEven as MAS plans an SGX revival, privatisations are still taking place\n\nTeo family, Dymon Asia consortium launches bid to take Amara private at S$0.60 a share\n\nAmara Holdings privatisation offer\u00a0fails to reach compulsory acquisition threshold\n\nThe low trading liquidity of Amara\u2019s shares was cited as one reason for the offer. The stock had an average trading volume of 21,201 shares over the 12-month period leading up to Apr 23. This represented 0.004 per cent of the company\u2019s total issued shares.\n\nAs at Apr 28, the company has an issued and paid-up share capital of S$125.6 million, comprising 575 million shares, excluding those held in treasury.\n\n\u201cThe offer represents a unique cash exit opportunity for shareholders to liquidate and realise their entire investment at a premium, an option which may not otherwise be readily available due to the low trading liquidity of the shares,\u201d it said.\n\nDRC Investments further cited the challenging macro and operating environment that Amara faces.\n\nThe rise in protectionist policies and shifting trade agreements could disrupt supply chains and increase costs for businesses.\n\n\u201cThese challenges may result in higher procurement expenses for the group\u2019s operations, squeezing profit margins and impacting long-term growth prospects,\u201d it said, adding that prolonged uncertainty could also lead to consumers tightening their purse strings.\n\nIt also noted challenges arising from shifting consumer behaviour and retail disruptions, particularly for its malls in Singapore and China, including 100 AM in the Central Business District, which was rebranded from the former Amara Shopping Centre.\n\nThe offeror said: \u201cThe group may encounter challenges in optimising its tenant mix, sustaining profitability, and ensuring that its malls remain attractive to shoppers amid shifting market dynamics.\u201d\n\nOng Eng Yaw, director of the offeror and group managing director of Hwa Hong, said the consortium aims to future-proof Amara\u2019s assets to ensure that they are \u201cwell-positioned\u201d to cater to evolving consumer behaviour and expectations.\n\nAmara and its subsidiaries\u2019 business segments comprise hotel investment and management, property investment and development, and specialty restaurants and food services. The group has operations in Singapore, Thailand and China.\n\nIts hotel portfolio comprises its flagship Amara Singapore in Tanjong Pagar, Amara Sanctuary Resort Sentosa, Amara Signature Shanghai and Amara Bangkok. It also owns 100 AM malls in China.\n\nOther reasons for the privatisation offer include Amara\u2019s listing status bringing fewer benefits to the company and shareholders, as well as saving on listing expenses.\n\nPrevious offer\n\nThe latest offer is the second time Amara has been the target of a privatisation deal.\n\nIn 2023, the hotel group received a voluntary cash offer at S$0.60 a share from Amethyst Assets \u2013 a consortium linked to Albert Teo, other members of his family and private equity investor Dymon Asia.\n\nAmethyst cited a challenging growth environment and low trading liquidity as reasons for the deal. It also said high interest rates raised borrowing costs, which affected Amara\u2019s profitability.\n\nBut the S$0.60-per-share offer failed to reach the compulsory acquisition threshold of 90 per cent; the offeror had cobbled together 88.39 per cent in shareholding interest.\n\nAs a result, Amethyst was not able to buy over the shares of shareholders who did not accept the offer.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWhat's moving the markets?

The offer closes on May 8.\n\nCDLHH NZ, which is CDL\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, said that it will not raise the offer price further under the increased offer.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nAfter receiving overseas investment office consent, the NZ unit of CDL waived all of the remaining conditions of the new offer, including the 90 per cent minimum acceptance condition.\n\nThis means that the increased offer is now unconditional, and it will not make another takeover offer under the Takeovers Code for at least nine months from Apr 22.\n\nEarlier on Jan 20, CDL said a decision was made with a view to delist and privatise MCK, at NZ$2.25 a share. MCK rejected the offer on Feb 10, on the basis that the price was not sufficiently reflective of the value of its hotel and property net assets.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nCDL unit raises offer for M&C New Zealand to NZ$2.80 a share\n\nCDL Kiwi unit\u2019s NZ$2.25-per-share offer \u2018too low and inadequate\u2019: M&C New Zealand\n\nCDL\u2019s Kiwi unit makes NZ$2.25-a-share offer to delist M&C New Zealand\n\nMCK\u2019s largest institutional shareholder, Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) has stated it will not be accepting the new increased offer.\n\nACC is a large institutional fund with a long-term investment horizon, which holds approximately 4.5 per cent of the ordinary shares.\n\n\u201cOther holders of ordinary shares may not have the same investment horizon (too),\u201d said Preston.\n\nPreston also flagged a number of potential consequences which could affect minority shareholders if under the increased offer the threshold necessary to acquire the remaining shares is not met.\n\nThis mainly regards how liquidity for the shares of MCK would likely decrease on the New Zealand Exchange, its trading price may fall below the new offer price, and that there is no certainty that CDL\u2019s unit will make another takeover offer.\n\n\u201cWe encourage shareholders to consider these factors in light of their own circumstances as they decide whether or not to accept the increased offer,\u201d said Preston.\n\nShares of CDL were trading at 1.2 per cent or S$0.06 lower at S$4.93 as at 4.20 pm on Monday.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Companies & Markets\n\nZuckerberg says Meta will invest hundreds of billions in superintelligence\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:48 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLinkedIn settles antitrust lawsuit, agrees to contracting changes\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:12 PM\n\nUS: Wall Street opens mixed as investors digest fresh tariff threats\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:43 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nBRC Asia secures contracts for Changi Airport Terminal 5 project worth S$570 million\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:04 PM", "images": [{"image_url": null, "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/bd2b953c28bb897e79e8c5950b1e40f1a646e59d595c39203b60471d55d56b2b?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Generic photo of CDL"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/04360639076bb5117fef2a0e02a8b1f480426da3637913dba80341dd9eba99ab?w=180&h=120&dpr=1&f=webp", "alt_text": "City Development Ltd said the higher offer by its Kiwi subsidiary for Millennium & Copthorne Hotels New Zealand is the \"final and best\"."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/f56497a3ac813a3f77c9529b39d494870c75e816ab18b802cd8ac5cfb765553f?w=180&h=120&dpr=1&f=webp", "alt_text": "The privatisation deal is not expected to materially affect CDL's net tangible assets or consolidated earnings per share for the fiscal year ending Dec 31, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/3f211f558a41a0a0f648e92829072162bb7c44fb7f3bde227ba93335ef63c987?w=180&h=120&dpr=1&f=webp", "alt_text": "The  transactions are not expected to materially impact CDL's net tangible assets or consolidated earnings per share for the fiscal year ending Dec 31, 2025."}]}

We think that people have a right to talk to the parliamentary select committee.\u201d\n\nNTUC secretary-general Ng Chee Meng, who is contesting Jalan Kayu SMC for the PAP, said at the PAP rally on April 27 that the Income-Allianz deal was done in good faith.\n\nNg also responded to Singh\u2019s description of the labour movement as a \u201ctrampoline\u201d for losing PAP candidates. He said there is \u201cno safe harbour\u201d, as he had to stand for re-election in 2023 to continue as labour chief.\n\nSingh told reporters on April 28 that he disagreed with Ng\u2019s rebuttal.\n\n\u201cHave workers been disenfranchised in any way because of his leadership in NTUC and also not being in Parliament at the same time? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nSingh was also asked to respond to SM Lee\u2019s point that the Government would be in trouble if it lost more MPs who were good ministers.\n\nHe said it was a weak argument, pointing to former foreign affairs minister George Yeo, who lost his seat at the 2011 election.\n\n\u201cDid suddenly our Foreign Ministry lose its bearings?\u201d Singh asked. \u201cIt did not, because there\u2019s so much depth in Parliament.\u201d\n\nHe added that Singapore now has a more diverse political system, and Singaporeans want to see that expressed in Parliament.\n\n\u201cThe Workers\u2019 Party record in Parliament speaks for itself \u2013 very rational debate. Where we agree, we are not hesitant to say we agree. Where we disagree, we will explain why we disagree.\u201d\n\nOn foreign interference in Singapore politics, Singh said the concern was real, and that was why he extended his rally speech by two minutes on April 26 to address it.\n\nSingh said then that WP categorically rejected the involvement of any foreign element in Singapore\u2019s politics.\n\nThe Government earlier blocked Facebook posts by three foreigners for attempting to interfere in Singapore\u2019s election.\n\nThe authorities directed social media giant Meta to block access to posts by two Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS) politicians and a former Singaporean who was an Internal Security Act detainee.\n\nOne of them had expressed support for WP vice-chair and Tampines GRC candidate Faisal Manap.\n\nSingh said he was not aware of the Facebook posts until the authorities issued their statement.\n\nSeparately, WP also disputed claims by religious teacher Noor Deros that the party\u2019s candidates had agreed to take up concerns raised by asatizah, or Islamic religious teachers, regarding Singapore\u2019s Malay/Muslim community.\n\nSingh said he had known about this slightly earlier.\n\n\u201cI knew one or two days earlier that there\u2019s this gentleman who\u2019s saying that there\u2019s some secret handshake that the WP has done with him, which was not true,\u201d he said.\n\nOn April 28, WP\u2019s Tampines GRC team said they were committed to being the voice for residents and looked forward to having a chance to serve them.\n\nWP candidate Michael Thng said the team has received a warm reception from residents.\n\n\u201cThe most common refrain we keep hearing is how long they have waited for us to be here,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said his team is committed to ensuring \u201cwe get their estate right\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe will lean on the experience that we have had in Aljunied, Sengkang and Hougang to ensure that we keep the corridors clean, the plants pruned, the paint fresh, and to ensure that they would have a very nice living environment.\u201d\n\nResponding to Ng\u2019s criticism that WP does not have a plan for areas where it is not the incumbents, Lim said the party can put up feasible plans for an area only if it is in office.\n\nThe team has to understand the funding available and the town council\u2019s financial position.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense for contesting teams to make promises that have no substance,\u201d she said.\n\nTHE STRAITS TIMES\n\nFor more election coverage, visit our\n\nGE2025 microsite\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Singapore\n\nSingapore boosts support for Timor-Leste as it prepares to join Asean\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:36 PM\n\nEconomists upgrade 2025 outlook after\u00a0\nQ2 GDP turns out better than expected\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:02 PM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nDaily Debrief: What Happened Today (Jul 14)\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:30 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nSingapore GDP up 4.3% in Q2, well above market expectations amid US tariff pause\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:00 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/cb86a9685a2f96316368bb5e83c8843ebc1275d364d69cf582a0d2549874773f?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/ef9d9fe2dc021d90f71e06e3b159f759108de5cfc1b726d22a8b987f631deb41?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "A vote for the opposition is not a \u201cfree vote for more alternative voices\u201d, said PM Wong at Monday's rally."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/aa3c91c89e270f58ff094ef22f37633877675afba0e3485c96bcd09798267fa3?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Prime Minister Lawrence Wong is set to speak alongside eight other PAP election candidates at the Fullerton rally on Monday (Apr 28) afternoon."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/2ebb86b63338f3e51f4bf6599333b42781d4d2c01e3f0f15d3fd463d168e40e8?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Labour chief Ng Chee Meng apologised over the Allianz-Income deal at a PAP rally on Apr 27."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/abafb3c1166df21265ce699a9dd393bb3926ed9ae1e3de3f862cbe7e262fd8db?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Candidates from five political parties went on live TV on Sunday (Apr 27) night to debate three issues - geopolitics and the economy, immigration, and the cost-of-living."}]}

PHOTO: BT FILE\n\n[SINGAPORE] Employment growth slowed and unemployment rose in the first quarter of 2025, with the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) expecting the labour market to continue softening due to greater uncertainty in external growth prospects.\n\nSimilarly, economists also expect things to worsen. Maybank economist Chua Hak Bin warned that employment could even shrink in the second half, with the unemployment rate climbing towards 3.5 per cent by year end.\n\nIn Q1, total employment grew by 2,300, based on advance figures from MOM on Monday (Apr 28).\n\nThis was below the\n\nprevious quarter\u2019s increase of 7,700\n\n\u2013 which MOM described as seasonal \u2013 and also lower than the year-ago increase of 3,200.\n\nThis was due to smaller increases in both resident and non-resident employment.\n\nResident employment continued to increase in the health and social services sector, as well as financial services. But it contracted in some outward-oriented sectors such as professional services, manufacturing, and information and communications.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nMeanwhile, growth in non-resident employment was driven entirely by work permit holders in lower-skilled jobs, mainly in administrative and support services, and community, social and personal services sectors.\n\nUnemployment rose slightly, with the resident unemployment rate at 2.9 per cent between January and March, up marginally from 2.8 per cent in December.\n\nThe citizen unemployment rate was 3.1 per cent in March, holding steady from February but higher than December\u2019s 2.9 per cent rate.

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG\n\n[TOKYO/NEW DELHI] Asian economies geared for exports and facing some of the highest US \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs are leading the way over their Western counterparts in trade negotiations with the Trump administration.\n\nPast experience suggests comprehensive trade deals take many months if not years to complete \u2013 time that countries including South Korea, Japan and India do not have, given their shipments to the US face levies rising to nearly 25 per cent in just over two months. Vietnam\u2019s is pegged at 46 per cent and Thailand\u2019s at 36 per cent.\n\nWhat\u2019s looking likelier for these countries are smaller, interim accords aimed at staving off the snapback of the most punitive US tariffs before the 90-day grace period expires in early July. That would allow US President Donald Trump to tout quick success in his disruptive trade policy.\n\nSpeaking on Sunday (Apr 27) on ABC News\u2019\n\nThis Week with George Stephanopoulos\n\n, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said there are 18 important US trading partners, including China which is undergoing a \u201cspecial negotiation\u201d.\n\nWith the other 17, \u201cWe have a process in place, over the next 90 days, to negotiate with them,\u201d Bessent said. \u201cSome of those are moving along very well, especially with the Asian countries.\u201d\n\nLast week Bessent said the US and South Korea could reach an \u201cagreement of understanding\u201d on trade as soon as this week. Korean officials say they see early July as the initial deadline for any concrete deal to at least clinch tariff exemptions.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nFriday, 8.30 am\n\nAsean Business\n\nBusiness insights centering on South-east Asia's fast-growing economies.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nExpecting more than that appears overly optimistic. The US and South Korea signed a free-trade agreement in 2007 that required more than a year to hammer out and took until 2011 for Congress to ratify. It then was re-negotiated under the first Trump administration for several more months in 2018.\n\nWith the US and China still at an impasse and other major Asian economies charting a faster track, US trading partners in North America and Europe are still trying to understand the basic parameters. Those include the scope of talks and who\u2019s running trade policy in Washington, while sounding less worried about speed.\n\nTo them, there are risks to seeking a first-mover advantage, and given Trump\u2019s impatience with China\u2019s determined response and resistance to talks unless Beijing\u2019s conditions are met, some sense patience is the more prudent approach.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nUS having daily talks with China over tariffs: US Agriculture secretary\n\n\u2018Welcome to the Thunderdome\u2019: Inside 100 dizzying days of Trump\n\nUS not ready to lower tariff on imports from Singapore, but agrees to explore way forward: DPM Gan\n\nMalaysia-US trade talks started \u2018well enough,\u2019 official says\n\nUS pharma tariffs would raise US drug costs by US$51 billion annually, report finds\n\nMore\n\nGauging progress\n\nOfficials from the European Union came away from their initial discussions in Washington in mid-April convinced that there\u2019s no negotiating away the 10 per cent levy \u2013 and that the US may double it to the so-called reciprocal level if there\u2019s no progress when the 90-day grace period expires. That could lead Brussels to retaliate, including with counter-tariffs against Trump\u2019s 25 per cent steel and aluminium import protection, as well as restrictions on exports to the US.\n\nThe UK is staring at a tariff fixed at the 10 per cent floor and does not sound like it\u2019s in a hurry. \u201cA deal can be done\u201d but \u201cwe are not going to rush\u201d, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves told reporters in Washington last week.\n\nCanada, whose tariffs are not affected by the temporary reprieve, is going to take it\u2019s time, too. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do a deal in the short term,\u201d Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters on Thursday, as he campaigned in British Columbia ahead of the Apr 28 election. \u201cMy government will do the right deal.\u201d\n\nAmong European countries, Switzerland jumped on the fast track given its goods are facing a 31 per cent duty. The government said it\u2019s one of 15 countries that will get \u201csomewhat preferential treatment\u201d, after agreeing to tariff negotiations with the Trump administration.\n\nLevies will be held at 10 per cent during the process, even if they extend beyond Trump\u2019s 90-day tariff pause, Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter said in Washington last Thursday.\n\nTrump\u2019s White House has singled out progress on talks with India, Japan and South Korea over the past week as it juggles dozens of meetings with countries.\n\nSectoral tariffs\n\nTrump has said he wants to drive down the US\u2019s bilateral trade deficits and seek lower tariff barriers for exporters, while also regularly signalling he does not plan on dropping countries below the 10 per cent tariff flat rate. The talks may also focus on sectoral tariffs, such as those on autos and metals.\n\nTrump was poised to meet with some world leaders about tariffs during a brief visit to Rome for the funeral of Pope Francis over the weekend. \u201cThe tariff plan is doing very well,\u201d Trump said on Friday at the White House as he left for the trip. \u201cWe are resetting the table.\u201d\n\nFor South Korea, progress can be linked generally to its approach of offering Trump officials what they are asking for: greater market access for American goods, lower non-tariff barriers and a desire to invest more stateside.\n\n\u201cWe presented our willingness and initiative to cooperate in areas of major interest to the US such as trade, investment, shipbuilding and energy,\u201d Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok said after meeting with Bessent.\n\nAdding to the challenge Asian countries face to strike deals is Trump\u2019s erratic course on tariffs. There\u2019s also the more practical issue of how Washington will handle the workload, especially with many staff-level positions in the administration still unfilled.\n\nTo help manage the next steps, the Trump team has drafted a framework to handle negotiations with about 18 countries, including a template that lays out common areas of concern to guide the discussions.\n\n\u2018Second act\u2019\n\n\u201cWe are into the first or second act of a theatre of negotiation between the United States and their various trading partners,\u201d said John Woods, the Asia chief investment officer of Lombard Odier. \u201cOnce we get close to that third act, maybe in the next couple of quarters or so, clarity towards the likely implications of the tariff story will become a lot clearer.\u201d\n\nJapan spent more than a year negotiating a 2019 trade agreement with the US during the first Trump administration. Tokyo\u2019s current top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, says the two sides have yet to agree on a full scope of negotiations ahead of his second trip to Washington for tariff talks, expected in the next few days.\n\nLocal media say Japan is considering buying more American corn and soybeans, and planning a new effort to showcase the US investment plans by Japanese carmakers. Japanese officials say they hope Bessent and other negotiators can help them get a deal, but they are wary about whether they can win over the president.\n\nBut Japan intends to push back against any US effort to bring it into an economic bloc aligned against China because of the importance of Tokyo\u2019s trade ties with Beijing, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nIndia is perhaps the most advanced of any nation in its trade talks with the US. The two sides have agreed on 19 areas for negotiation, including greater market access for goods and services such as agricultural products, and e-commerce, as well as issues related to corruption and rules of origin, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\nA framework for negotiations was completed after the meeting of US Vice-President JD Vance and Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week, after which the US said it\u2019s made \u201csignificant progress\u201d towards a bilateral trade deal.\n\nVietnam, Thailand\n\nMeanwhile, South-east Asian economies have offered to buy more US farm products, including meat, soybean and fresh fruit, as well as import more of its natural gas. They have also pledged to lower tariffs on a range of US goods, such as steel, electronics and automobiles.\n\nVietnam, which got hit with one of the highest reciprocal tariff rates, could also look to purchase Lockheed F-16 fighter jets as part of a trade deal.\n\nStill, there\u2019s a growing sense that the trade talks cannot simply be a one-way street. Indonesia\u2019s Coordinating Economic Minister Airlangga Hartarto said on Friday that the government will also ensure domestic interests as the US asks for more market access, investment deregulation, as well as cooperation in critical minerals supply chains.\n\nThat\u2019s an approach Thai officials are also pursuing.\n\n\u201cWe will approach the talks with the mindset that we will give them something if they are also willing to give us something,\u201d Thailand Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra also said on Thursday, when the nation announced that negotiations with the US would be postponed.

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG\n\nPublished Mon, Apr 28, 2025 \u00b7 01:01 PM\n\n[LONDON] Airbus reached a final agreement to take over some assets and sites from Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, clearing the way for the struggling US aerospace supplier to be acquired by its former parent Boeing.\n\nThe European planemaker will take over a facility in Kinston, North Carolina, for fuselage sections of the Airbus A350 model, as well as a site in France also making parts for the widebody plane. Other factories include a wing manufacturing site for the A220 in Belfast, Ireland, and a wing-component site in Prestwick, Scotland, according to a statement by Spirit.\n\nSome portions of the deal are tentative, like the remainder of the Belfast site and a business in Malaysia, which Airbus will take over if no other suitable buyer is identified.\n\nAirbus will receive a payment of US$439 million from Spirit to take the assets, according to a release by Airbus. The planemaker will also provide Spirit with US$200 million of credit lines to help the struggling manufacturer support the Airbus programmes. Airbus said the financial accord will not change its earnings outlook for this year.\n\n\u201cWith this operation, Airbus aims to ensure the stability of supply for its commercial aircraft programmes through a more sustainable way forward, both operationally and financially, for key Airbus work packages,\u201d Airbus said.\n\nThe Airbus deal is a key part of a complex three-way transaction that reunites Boeing with Spirit, an operation that the US company spun off in 2005.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nWhile Spirit has since become an important vendor to Airbus, it\u2019s still Boeing\u2019s largest single supplier. Boeing\u2019s US$4.7 billion acquisition, announced in July 2024, required Airbus to take over some operations or rely on its global rival Boeing to supply it with critical aircraft components.\n\nSpirit AeroSystems, which makes the fuselage for Boeing\u2019s 737 aircraft from its base in Wichita, has struggled financially for years. Both planemakers have provided it with hundreds of millions of US dollars in funding to prop up its finances and keep parts flowing.\n\nBoeing\u2019s move to reacquire its former subsidiary was triggered by a near-catastrophic accident on January 2024 in which a fuselage built by Spirit lost a large panel during flight. That mishap led to a rolling crisis at Boeing, leading to a management shakeup, an ongoing quality makeover and federal limits on Boeing\u2019s production that are still in place.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nAirbus plans to buy US$2 billion worth of parts from India every year\n\nAirbus wins \u00a3150 million contract to land European rover on Mars\n\nAt the time of the deal\u2019s initial announcement in July 2024, Airbus said it would pay US$1 for the Spirit assets it was acquiring, and receive US$559 million in compensation. Airbus said on Monday that the compensation amount has been adjusted to reflect revised transaction perimeters.\n\nThe facilities that Airbus is taking over are crucial to the European planemaker\u2019s aircraft programmes, and have struggled to keep up with Airbus\u2019s timetables to increase output. Chief executive officer Guillaume Faury said in February that issues at Spirit were putting pressure on the ramp-ups of both its A350 widebody and A220 single-aisle aircraft programmes.\n\nSpirit makes the central section panels for the A350 in Kinston, which are incorporated into the widebody\u2019s fuselage in Saint-Nazare. In Belfast, it makes advanced compositae wings for the A220. The Prestwick plant builds wing leading and trailing edge elements for the A320, Airbus\u2019s top-selling jet.\n\nAirbus is keen to ramp up output of the fuel-efficient and airy A220 model that it acquired control of from Bombardier for a symbolic one Canadian dollar in 2018. Under Bombardier, the programme was years late and billions over budget, and Airbus has said it wants to cut costs and turn around the loss-making programme by building 14 units a month by 2026.

It was also recognition from the party for my efforts in terms of reaching out to the residents of the constituencies,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile he is nervous about his first electoral outing, Sani \u2013 who described himself as a \u201cpeople\u2019s person\u201d \u2013 says he has enjoyed conducting walkabouts and door-to-door visits on the campaign trail so far.\n\n\u201cIt excites me so much to meet the residents that at the end of the day when I get home, I still can\u2019t sleep because the adrenaline is still pumping.\u201d\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nDrawing on his experience abroad\n\nSani, who moved to the UK in 1996 to pursue a law degree, said that his work experience overseas has made him a \u201csuper-believer\u201d of out-of-the-box solutions.\n\nHe held several senior executive roles during his 17 years in the UK, including as chief executive officer of a security firm where he revamped operations amid a labour crunch.\n\nHe introduced technology to cut reliance on manpower and retrained staff to support the company\u2019s backend functions.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nGE2025: Is this the end of the road for PSP?\n\nGE2025: Desmond Lee refutes PSP proposal for return to 7% GST, cites Singapore\u2019s ageing population\n\nGE2025: Danger of \u2018inbreeding\u2019 in PAP\u2019s candidate selection process, says PSP\u2019s Tan Cheng Bock\n\nGE2025: West Coast sees repeat battle, with PSP\u2019s Tan Cheng Bock leading team against PAP\n\nGE2025: PAP rejects call to debate with PSP\u2019s West Coast-Jurong West GRC team\n\nMore\n\nSani also worked at one of the UK\u2019s regional development agencies (RDAs), which were public bodies that drove economic development across different localities. One of his main responsibilities was helping to revitalise South Yorkshire\u2019s infrastructure and public services to attract new businesses, following a spike in unemployment after coal mines were shut in the county.\n\nAs part of the RDA task force, he helped develop strategies to create jobs and ensure residents possessed the skills needed by incoming businesses. His team introduced a training programme that provided job seekers with guaranteed placements upon completion, ensuring they could move directly into employment.\n\nSani said that if elected, he hopes to draw on his vast work experience to improve the lives of residents in West Coast-Jurong West. Among the key issues he wishes to address are jobs and work-life balance for residents.\n\nHis ideas include helping residents find jobs with short travel times of under 30 minutes so that they can have better work-life balance. One way this could be done is to encourage businesses to be located within the constituency, or match residents with jobs that are located nearby.\n\nBeyond job fairs which simply provide information on job availability, Sani also wants businesses to provide job training programmes for residents so that they can gain skills that are directly relevant to the business itself.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s not just about job matching, but also in terms of looking at the eco-system for the employee holistically,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also wants to rejuvenate the \u201ctired\u201d amenities in areas such as Taman Jurong. He proposed creating areas where seniors can network, such as a park for bird enthusiasts to gather.\n\nOn the campaign trail\n\nSani, who is the managing director of a firm specialising in condo and facilities management, shared that this is not his first foray into politics.\n\nHe had been an active member of the ruling People\u2019s Action Party youth wing before he left for the UK. However, his time abroad showed that people with differing views could \u201csit around the same table\u201d and have discussions with the common objective of enhancing policies for citizens, said Sani.\n\nHe eventually joined the PSP at the request of a friend, who was also a party member. Sani added that he was also inspired to do so by the party\u2019s co-founder, Dr Tan, who had come out of retirement to contest in the last election in 2020.\n\nWorking the ground alongside Dr Tan, a former PAP MP of 26 years, has taught him how to connect with residents and reflect on how best to support them as a parliamentarian, said Sani.\n\nWith polling day looming on May 3, BT asked Sani how he was handling the pressure of being in his first election \u2013 especially as part of the PSP\u2019s A-team in a constituency that saw the tightest contest five years ago.\n\n\u201cPressure is always there in anything you do. But fortunately for me, I work best when I\u2019m under pressure,\u201d he said.\n\nFor more election coverage, visit our\n\nGE2025 microsite\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWhat's moving the markets?

I just want to keep the status quo,\u201d he added.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nWhen Trump was inaugurated in January, Liberal Party leader Peter Dutton was ahead in the polls, as Australians expressed anger over the cost of living and housing affordability.\n\nMost polls in the final stretch of the campaign show Labor ahead, although it may need the support of independent lawmakers to form a government.\n\n\u201cVoters want stability while an idiot like that is in charge in the United States,\u201d said Lawrence Jurman, 71. \u201cI think it has hurt the Liberals.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nAustralia\u2019s PM approval rises as Trump looms over May election\n\nAndrew Carswell, former press secretary to Liberal Party Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who lost office at the previous election, said Trump had been \u201ca wrecking ball\u201d for Australia\u2019s conservative coalition and more broadly across the world.\n\n\u201cAustralian voters are looking on with concern at what is happening and saying if that is change, we don\u2019t want it,\u201d he said.\n\nThree recent surveys show negative public reaction to Trump, while Liberal Party insiders told Reuters the anti-Trump sentiment was impacting Dutton\u2019s campaign as voters rapidly became risk-averse. Australian pension funds, exposed to the US stock market rout, are one way voters are taking a direct hit.\n\nAlthough Trump was not the decisive factor in Dutton\u2019s fall in opinion polls \u2013 Albanese has run a strong campaign, and Dutton made mistakes including a short-lived policy to ban public servants working from home \u2013 it added to voter reservations, said two political strategists.\n\n\u201cPeter is basically a mainstream Australian conservative, he is not an extremist. Some people in the party got Trumpy in a trivial way,\u201d said a former Liberal campaign strategist who knows Dutton and declined to be named.\n\nIndependent political consultant Simon Jackman said Albanese\u2019s decision to delay the election when a cyclone threatened Brisbane meant the campaign coincided with Trump imposing tariffs which shocked Australians.\n\nThe Liberal Party has historically seen itself as closer to the US, striking security and free trade agreements, he said.\n\n\u201cYou had the amazing spectacle of a leader of the conservative party in Australia, Dutton, having to distance himself from the president of the United States,\u201d said Jackman.\n\nThe election had been shaping up as a retrospective about what a bad job Albanese and Labor had done in managing the cost of living crisis, Jackman said, but that changed.\n\n\u201cIt became (about) which party could shield Australia from an incredibly uncertain global economic environment, led largely by the actions of the American president.\u201d\n\nThe Trump effect is also boosting the \u201cTeal\u201d independents \u2013 female lawmakers who won city seats from the Liberals in 2022 by championing action on climate change, and could determine which party forms government if neither secures a clear majority, adds Jackman.\n\nIn the week after Trump and his Doge adviser Elon Musk arrived in the White House, Dutton criticised public servants hired as \u201cculture, diversity and inclusion advisers\u201d. He would appoint a rising conservative star, indigenous woman Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, to a Ministry of Government Efficiency, he said.\n\nMedia seized on the moment Senator Price, the former deputy mayor of a desert town wracked by violence, said she wanted to \u201cmake Australia great again\u201d. She later said the echo of Trump\u2019s slogan was a slip of the tongue.\n\n\u201cThere was an early attachment to Trump euphoria when things were glowing, and then when they turned sharply, the alignment with the Trump administration hurt them, particularly policies on cutting the public service and work from home,\u201d said Carswell, who adds the campaign was \u201cawful timing\u201d for Dutton.\n\nUS trade negotiators also complained about Australia\u2019s subsidised medicine scheme, bolstering Labor\u2019s election attack \u2013 denied by Dutton \u2013 that he would \u201cAmericanise\u201d health.\n\nAlbanese has largely avoided direct criticism of Trump, because of the importance of the US security alliance. He did not attend Trump\u2019s inauguration and has not gone to Washington, saying he will wait for the results of the May 3 election.\n\nDutton, asked about Trump in a televised leaders debate mid-campaign, said: \u201cI don\u2019t know the president, I\u2019ve not met him.\u201d\n\nWhen shown a picture of Musk in the final leaders debate on Sunday, Dutton said the first words that came to mind were \u201cevil genius\u201d.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t sought to be anybody other than myself,\u201d he said, when asked if he was distancing himself from Trump\u2019s style.\n\nA Resolve poll for\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald\n\n, which directly asked about Trump\u2019s impact on the election, found 68 per cent of those surveyed said Trump was bad for Australia, and 35 per cent of undecided voters were less likely to back Dutton because of Trump.\n\nIpsos Australia director Jessica Elgood says the Trump effect can be seen in other polls where cost of living tops concerns.\n\n\u201cIf you are concerned about the range of issues related to the cost of living, you are going to be worried by the global financial instability and unpredictability that has occurred over the last few weeks since the tariffs were announced,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTaken together, it creates an environment where the safety of a known quantity \u2013 Labor and Albanese \u2013 is more compelling than the risk of the unknown \u2013 Dutton.\u201d REUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in International\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:54 PM\n\nSuspended Thailand PM Paetongtarn hit by ethics investigation, source and media say\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:07 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/f6252c4958cee2cdbb21b94df8b1a9ed4055a72a31a2dea7dad93f169061663d?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Anthony Albanese, Australia's prime minister, speaks during the Labor Party federal election campaign launch in Perth, Australia, on Sunday, April 13, 2025.

PHOTO: AFP\n\nPublished Mon, Apr 28, 2025 \u00b7 02:41 PM\n\n[OTTAWA] Canada elects a new government on Monday (Apr 28) to confront annexation threats from the United States and deal directly with President Donald Trump, whose trade war has defined the campaign.\n\nThe Liberal Party, led by new Prime Minister Mark Carney, looked set to lose easily to the Conservatives\u2019 Pierre Poilievre until the US president\u2019s attacks on the country sparked a sudden reversal in poll forecasts.\n\nCarney, 60, has never held elected office and only replaced Justin Trudeau as prime minister last month. He had a lucrative career as an investment banker before serving as the central bank governor in both Canada and Britain.\n\nCarney has argued his global financial experience has prepared him to guide Canada\u2019s response to Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nHe has also promised to revitalise internal trade and expand Canada\u2019s economic opportunities abroad to cut reliance on the United States, a country Carney says \u201cwe can no longer trust.\u201d\n\nThe United States under Trump \u201cwants to break us, so they can own us,\u201d he has warned repeatedly through the campaign.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need chaos, we need calm. We don\u2019t need anger, we need an adult,\u201d Carney said in the campaign\u2019s closing days.\n\nPoilievre, a 45-year-old career politician, has tried to keep the focus on domestic concerns that made Trudeau deeply unpopular toward the end of his decade in power, especially soaring living costs.\n\nThe Tory leader has argued Carney would bring a continuation of what he calls \u201cthe lost Liberal decade,\u201d arguing that only a new Conservative government can take action against crime, housing shortages and other non-Trump issues Canadians rank as priorities.\n\n\u201cYou cannot handle another four years of this,\u201d he said over the weekend.\n\nPoilievre has critiqued Trump, but insisted ten years of poor Liberal governance had left Canada vulnerable to a newly hostile United States.\n\nFinal polls indicate a tight race but put Carney as the favourite.\n\nSurveys have also consistently shown voters view the ex-central banker as the best candidate to deal with Trump.\n\nJeff Sims, who lives in Quebec near Canada\u2019s capital Ottawa, said he believes Carney has \u201cthe pedigree\u201d to be prime minister.\n\n\u201cTwo central banks under his belt, I think that\u2019s a good pick,\u201d the 46-year-old told AFP on Sunday.\n\nAt a weekend Conservative rally in the battleground city of Oakville, west of Toronto, Janice Wyner rejected the notion that Carney marked a departure from Trudeau.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s \u201cpolicies stunk and it\u2019s the same party,\u201d she told AFP.\n\n\u201cCanada is just in a mess. I\u2019m 70 years old. It\u2019s not even a country that I recognise, and I\u2019m worried for my grandkids.\u201d\n\nLike many voters, Nadine Sokol, a 41-year-old who also lives near Ottawa, listed \u201cthe threat coming from the US\u201d as her \u201cnumber one issue.\u201d\n\nIf the Liberals win, it would mark one of the most of dramatic turnarounds in Canadian political history.\n\nOn January 6, the day Trudeau announced he would resign, the Conservatives led the Liberals by more than 20 points in most polls, and Poilievre looked on track to be Canada\u2019s next prime minister.\n\nBut Carney replacing Trudeau combined with nationwide unease about Trump transformed the race.\n\nPublic broadcaster CBC\u2019s poll aggregator on Sunday put the Liberals\u2019 national support at 42.8 per cent, with the Conservatives at 38.8 per cent.\n\nAs with US elections, national polling numbers may not predict a result.\n\nThe performance of two smaller parties \u2013 the left-wing New Democratic Party (NDP) and the separatist Bloc Quebecois \u2013 will be closely watched.\n\nIn past elections, strong NDP performances in Ontario and British Columbia, and a good showing by the Bloc in Quebec, have curbed Liberal seat tallies, but polls suggest both smaller parties could be facing a setback.\n\nNearly 29 million of Canada\u2019s estimated 41 million people are eligible to vote. A record 7.3 million people cast advanced ballots.\n\nIn the massive G7 country which spans six times zones, polls open at 8.30 am local time in the Atlantic province of Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\nCanadians will elect 343 members of parliament, meaning 172 seats are needed for a majority. The Liberals won a majority in 2015 but have governed with a minority since 2019.

The nation has 30 under construction, nearly half the global total, and is expected to leapfrog the US to become the world\u2019s largest atomic energy generator by the end of the decade.\n\nThe 10 latest reactors are expected to cost a total of 200 billion yuan (S$36 billion), according to local media outlet,\n\nThe Paper.\n\nFour were awarded to China General Nuclear Power, to be deployed at its Fangchenggang and Taishan plants. China National Nuclear, State Power Investment and China Huaneng Group won approvals for two reactors each.\n\nSeveral Chinese nuclear stocks rose as trading opened on Monday, with CGN Power\u2019s Hong Kong-listed shares jumping 4.1 per cent.\n\nChina\u2019s nuclear capacity is expected to reach 65 gigawatts by the end of 2025, according to the China Electricity Council, up from under 60 gigawatts last year. By 2040, the country\u2019s atomic fleet is expected to reach 200 gigawatts and account for about 10 per cent of total power output, according to a report published on Sunday by the China Nuclear Energy Association.\n\nThe key to executing that plan will be maintaining cost discipline. The US$2.7 billion price tag for each of the 10 planned reactors stands in contrast to recent projects in the US and Europe beset by delays and overruns. In the UK, two reactors under construction at Hinkley Point C are expected to cost a combined \u00a347.9 billion (S$83.8 billion).\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nChina March industrial profits rise, defying trade tensions\n\nChina vows to ready emergency plans, signals calm amid trade war\n\nChina\u2019s export-led growth exposes economy to steeper tariff hit\n\nChina accelerates budget spending to counter tariff woes\n\nMore\n\nChina benefits from a state-run apparatus that gives project developers access to loans at low interest rates \u2013 a key savings given that most of a nuclear plant\u2019s lifetime cost is the upfront construction.\n\nA steady pipeline of projects means that supply chains can mature and construction crews can gain experience, reducing the chance of costly delays.

Prolonged trade tensions could cause further disruptions and dampen global demand. But if trade tensions de-escalate, sentiments and export activity will get a boost.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nOCBC chief economist Selena Ling said a technical recession \u2013 two straight quarters of quarter-on-quarter decline \u2013 is \u201cquite likely\u201d for Singapore.\n\nIn Q2, \u201csequential growth momentum will potentially decelerate further\u201d with tariff uncertainty and escalating US-China tensions, she said.\n\nBut the risk of a full recession \u2013 with full-year GDP shrinking \u2013 depends on how trade talks go during the current 90-day tariff suspension, she added. If higher reciprocal tariffs kick in and sector tariffs are imposed, things could \u201cspiral downhill further\u201d.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nSingapore\u2019s Q1 employment growth slows, unemployment edges up, with further softening ahead\n\nImpact of Trump tariffs could push Singapore into technical recession, after Q1 growth disappoints: economists\n\nFor Maybank economist Brian Lee, whether Singapore will experience a technical recession is a \u201cclose call\u201d. By his estimate, this will happen if Q2 GDP growth is lower than 2.5 per cent year on year \u2013 which is \u201cnot implausible\u201d.\n\nEven if that happens, full-year growth can fall within the official forecast range, as long as first-half growth comes in at 3 per cent, he added.\n\nTariff impact\n\nEarlier in April, the US imposed a baseline 10 per cent tariff \u2013 with higher rates for certain countries \u2013 on all imports, including those from Singapore.\n\n\u201cThe impact of the tariffs will propagate through multiplier effects and generate a broader negative income and demand shock to the Singapore economy,\u201d said MAS.\n\nAs the tariffs squeeze export margins, companies may cut production and reduce demand. This could constrain aggregate demand more broadly.\n\nBeyond the direct impact, Singapore will be affected by slower growth in trading partners similarly hit by tariffs \u2013 including China, its largest export market.\n\nSingapore exports intermediate goods and services to China, for use in China\u2019s exports to the US \u2013 and these may suffer as China faces extremely high US tariffs.\n\nThere are similar indirect effects through other regional economies such as Asean, given Singapore\u2019s importance in production and trading supply chains, said MAS.\n\nGrowth will also be hurt as confidence is eroded by uncertainty about the final tariff rates, said MAS. This means a broader pullback in global consumption and investment spending.\n\nExternal weakness\n\nWith the US tariffs, prospects for global trade and growth have dimmed, said MAS. Global growth is expected to slow to between 2 and 2.5 per cent in 2025, from 3.2 per cent last year.\n\nGlobal financial market volatility and risk aversion have risen sharply, while global financial conditions have tightened, said MAS. The tighter financial conditions may further constrain spending and investment \u2013 putting further downward pressure on growth.\n\nSingapore\u2019s external-facing industries are expected to take the greatest hit. Manufacturing is likely to suffer from slower demand, due mainly to the global IT industry.\n\n\u201cOngoing uncertainties are likely to further dampen the already-moderating tech cycle,\u201d said MAS, though it noted that demand for artificial intelligence-related chips will provide some support to the global semiconductor industry.\n\nThe financial sector could see reduced credit intermediation activity as investment declines, while fees and commissions might fall with the rise in risk-off sentiment.\n\nIn contrast, the domestic-oriented sector \u201cwill continue to provide an underlying base of activity in the economy\u201d, said MAS, citing a strong pipeline of construction projects.\n\nWhile consumer-facing industries such as food and beverage (F&B) and retail continue to face a challenging operating environment, net firm formation in F&B \u201cappears to be on a mild uptrend\u201d.\n\nMore disinflation ahead\n\nOn inflation, MAS noted that low headline and core inflation in Q1 \u201creflect a strengthening of the disinflation trend that began in mid-2024\u201d.\n\nInflation momentum turned negative in Q1 \u2013 which is atypical, having only happened twice in the decade before Covid-19, it said.\n\nThe current trend appears more similar to 2019, when global trade conflict caused cyclical weakness, said MAS. The low inflation in 2015 was more narrowly based, driven by a large fall in energy prices.\n\nAt home, \u201ccontinuing lacklustre consumer spending\u201d may also be dampening inflation, added MAS.\n\nOn balance, global tariffs are likely to be disinflationary, said MAS. US tariffs mean higher imported inflation for the US, but should have little effect on Singapore consumer prices. Instead, weaker global demand will put downward pressure on Singapore\u2019s import costs.\n\n\u201cWith the downgrade in Singapore\u2019s GDP growth forecast, domestic demand and cost pressures are also expected to moderate,\u201d said MAS.\n\nAs aggregate labour demand eases, so will nominal wage growth. This will weaken discretionary spending by consumers, but also cap unit labour cost increases in the services sector.\n\nAs growth slows and inflation cools, UOB associate economist Jester Koh expects that  MAS would flatten the policy slope in its July review.\n\nBut Maybank\u2019s Lee does not expect further MAS easing this year \u201cin the absence of a deep global recession\u201d.\n\nLabour demand softening\n\nMAS expects employment growth to slow for most sectors, as firms pull back on hiring and expansion plans amid economic uncertainty.\n\nThis is especially in the trade-related sectors of manufacturing and wholesale trade. Still, changes in headcount should mainly affect non-resident workers, who account for a large portion of employment in those sectors.\n\nBut MAS warned that if aggregate labour demand falls faster than expected, labour market slack could \u201cemerge more conspicuously\u201d \u2013 showing up in higher unemployment.\n\nWhile the job vacancy rate has been declining, the unemployment rate has not risen significantly thus far, as labour demand has been easing against a tight labour market, said MAS.\n\nHowever, if labour demand falls significantly from here, such that the market is no longer as tight, further declines in job vacancies will cause a greater rise in unemployment.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWhat's moving the markets?

Najib said an \u201caddendum order\u201d to the pardon that granted him home detention was ignored by authorities.\n\nThe former king\u2019s palace has issued a letter saying the document does exist, but Malaysia\u2019s law ministry said it has no record of it, its home minister has denied knowledge and Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has said \u201cwe did not hide anything\u201d.\n\nNajib was found guilty in 2020 of criminal breach of trust and abuse of power for illegally receiving funds misappropriated from a unit of state investor 1Malaysia Development Berhad.

But analysts warned that macroeconomic uncertainties \u2013 including the direction and impact of interest rates and trade tariffs \u2013 are throwing this strategy of maintaining a well-balanced, diversified portfolio into disarray.\n\nThe way DBS chief investment officer Hou Wey Fook sees it, current macroeconomic conditions have rendered the 60/40 portfolio investment strategy suboptimal.\n\nFor moderate-risk investors, the 60/40 portfolio allocation has been a popular rule of thumb as it seeks to balance the higher risk and higher return potential of equities with the lower risk and stability of bonds.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, for example, investors leaned heavily on the 60/40 portfolio, using bonds to help cushion the stock market volatility.\n\nBonds \u2013 especially US Treasuries \u2013 have often been viewed as an effective hedge against equity-led losses, though this relationship has weakened in recent years amid rising inflation and interest rates.\n\nBut the 60/40 strategy is not foolproof; in a recent example, it faltered in 2022 when both bonds and stocks suffered negative returns \u2013 leaving some market watchers wondering if it is wise to continue to deploy this allocation strategy.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nHou notes that interest rates are widely expected to fall, which traditionally would support a rebound in the appeal of the 60/40 portfolio. But he cautioned that investors must watch out for the risks.\n\n\u201cThe huge US fiscal deficits have diminished the efficacy of rate hikes in taming inflation,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly selected buckets of quality bonds can catch the tailwinds of rate cuts.\u201d\n\nHou added that the most recent tariff-driven sell-offs in both equity and Treasury bonds highlighted that there is no guarantee for equity-bond correlations to tilt in favour of the 60/40 strategy, even amid ongoing rate-cutting cycles.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nBT Money Hacks: Balanced investing in volatile times\n\nStay calm; think through your choices in a falling market\n\nOng Ming Yi, a portfolio manager at PhillipCapital, said investors should aim for a portfolio that presents the highest returns. Currently, this means allocating 100 per cent of the portfolio to stocks despite the higher volatility.\n\n\u201cIn terms of dividend yield, (investors) will not get much with bonds as compared to stocks,\u201d Ong told\n\nThe Business Times.\n\n\u201cStocks beats bonds by a margin of at least two times.\u201d\n\nHe added that although stocks present higher risks, the Sharpe ratio \u2013 which adjusts returns for risk \u2013 still favours equities.\n\n\u201cThe largest bond fund in the US has a negative Sharpe ratio, meaning it underperforms even risk-free Treasury bonds,\u201d Ong said.\n\n\u201cSo if you have a three-year buffer in savings, it makes more sense to go 100 per cent equities \u2013 you do not have to touch your investments during a drawdown; and historically, stock drawdowns do not last more than three years,\u201d Ong noted.\n\nIn light of US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, Ong said he has re-aligned his portfolio into investing in stocks that could potentially benefit from trade protectionism, such as companies that largely receive their raw materials from the US.\n\nLooking ahead, Hugh Chung, Endowus\u2019 chief investment officer, warned that high inflation could present another risk for investors considering building 60/40 portfolios.\n\n\u201cSticky inflation may prompt interest rate hikes, which can negatively impact bond values,\u201d he said.\n\nChung added that high inflation combined with slowing economic growth \u2013 or stagflation \u2013 could pose challenges for equities, especially when stock valuations are already high.\n\nHowever, Aaron Chwee, OCBC\u2019s head of wealth advisory, believes that the 60/40 portfolio remains a relevant investment strategy, especially for long-term investors seeking a balance between growth and risk mitigation.\n\n\u201cAmid all the recent market uncertainty, it is even more important for investors to diversify their portfolios with equities and bonds,\u201d said Chwee.\n\nHe believes it is prudent to be diversified by always having exposure to both equities and bonds for the best combination of \u201cdefensiveness and growth potential\u201d.\n\nAlternative assets\n\nMeanwhile, some analysts believe that consumers could better benefit from having a mixture of classical and alternative assets \u2013 hedge funds, gold and private assets.\n\nThese alternatives are designed to deliver returns that are uncorrelated with traditional public markets, said Hou.\n\n\u201cThis model offers stronger performance while maintaining portfolio resilience\u2026 which is crucial in an era of rising geopolitical risks and market volatility,\u201d he added.\n\nStashAway\u2019s chief investment officer, Stephanie Leung, also believes that gold will be a balancing asset alongside bonds in modern portfolios.\n\n\u201cGold has historically performed well in periods of market stress and uncertainty, often moving independently of both equities and bonds, offering valuable diversification,\u201d Leung said.\n\nInvestors should consider diversifying their portfolios beyond just bonds and equities and consider across geographies, sectors and bond durations, Leung said.\n\nFor instance, when US mega-cap tech stocks declined significantly this year, defensive sectors such as healthcare and consumer staples delivered positive returns of 6.5 and 5.2 per cent respectively.\n\nUOB head of deposits and wealth management Winston Lim reinforced the need for adaptability and liquidity.\n\nHe said: \u201cRising or accelerated inflation because of trade tariffs could derail the outlook for rate cuts... which can impact both stocks and bonds negatively.\u201d\n\nHe also highlighted the value of holding more cash during downturns.\n\n\u201cBy raising cash, investors can maintain liquidity\u2026 (and) take advantage of lower asset prices once the market stabilises,\u201d Lim said.\n\nWhile market conditions continue to be volatile with the escalating trade tensions between the US and China, long-term investors should focus on fundamentals such as growth, inflation and liquidity as these factors ultimately drive markets beyond the short-term headlines, Leung said.\n\n\u201cUltimately, investors should choose a portfolio with a risk level they are comfortable sticking with for the long term, and keep dollar-cost averaging into it through market ups and downs,\u201d she added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The BCI 5TC rose steadily, closing the week at $15,667, up from $13,774 on Tuesday. In the Pacific, sentiment improved significantly midweek as C5 rates climbed from early lows, supported by growing cargo volumes and increased miner activity. By week\u2019s end, a tightening tonnage list and firmer fixing levels pointed to a strengthening market, with the C5 index rising from $7.085 to $7.815.\n\nThe Atlantic basin mirrored this positive trend, buoyed by a firmer FFA market and strong demand from South Brazil and West Africa to China. A midweek flurry of fixtures pushed rates higher, resulting in the C3 index climbing from $18.685 to $19.755. In the North Atlantic, the Fronthaul market also saw solid activity, particularly on EC Canada to China cargoes, contributing to a reduced tonnage list.\n\nPanamax\n\nThis week, the Atlantic market was once again the centre of attention, possibly influenced by the easing of US tariffs before Easter. Strong demand across the basin significantly impacted rates, which surged forward with reports of various fronthaul fixtures from North Coast South America. It was rumoured that $20,000 was fixed a few times for North Coast South America to China runs on 82,000-dwt vessels, pushing headline rates higher. Additionally, the increasing demand for North Atlantic Trans-Atlantic grain added further momentum.\n\nIn Asia, the market rose steadily throughout the week, supported by the positive sentiment from the Atlantic market for southern tonnage. Meanwhile, in the North, consistent NoPac demand kept rates stable at around the $12,000 average mark. Although limited period fixtures were reported, the outlook improved with rising paper values.

The Atlantic was described generally as very slow although as there week closed there was better activity from the South Atlantic. The Continent-Mediterranean lacked fresh impetus and rates struggled. Similarly, the US Gulf remained rather dull an ultramax heard fixed in the mid $14,000s for a trans-Atlantic run.\n\nFrom Asia, it was a more buoyant affair. Better levels were being achieved from South Africa, a 63,000-dwt fixing from here for a trip to China at $17,000 plus $170,000 ballast bonus. Demand remained from Indonesia, a 54,000-dwt fixing delivery Bontang trip via Indonesia redelivery China at $16,000. Whilst a 63,000-dwt open South China fixed a trip via Indonesia redelivery WC India at $17,000.

A 42,000-dwt vessel was fixed for delivery SW Pass and redelivery WC Central America at $14,250. The Asian market also remained flat, despite a gradual increase in tonnage, some fresh demand has helped to maintain current rates, with no significant changes in cargo volumes to drive rates higher.

The TC19 voyage of 37kt ARA/West Africa index as usual continued to follow TC2 and went from WS172.19 to WS167.5.\n\nUSG MRs ultimately sunk back down again this week. The TC14 38kt US-Gulf/UK-Continent went from WS128.57 to WS107.56. The TC18 the 38kt US Gulf/Brazil index dropped 21.43 points to WS155 and a Caribbean run on TC21, 38kt US-Gulf/Caribbean came off 23% to $503,571.\n\nThe MR Atlantic Triangulation Basket TCE went from $26,808 to $22,498.\n\nHandymax\n\nBaltic Clean Handymax\u2019s remained relatively flat in the Mediterranean this week, the TC6 index did however drop from WS175.56 to WS169.72. Up on the UK-Continent the TC23 30kt Cross UK-Continent also shed 10.28 points to WS170.\n\nVLCC\n\nThe market has turned around again, and gains have been made on all routes this week. The rate for the 270,000 mt Middle East Gulf to China trip (TD3C) has climbed 5 points since Easter to WS70.93 corresponding to a round-trip TCE of $55,010.\n\nIn the Atlantic market, the rate for 260,000 mt West Africa/China (TD15) rose 4 points to WS68.41 giving a round voyage TCE of $52,418 per day. The rate for 270,000 mt US Gulf/China (TD22) has been steadily recovering and is now $237,942 higher than just before the Easter break at $8,347,667 which shows a daily round trip TCE of $45,941.\n\nSuezmax\n\nSuezmax owners continued to push on upwards in West Africa. The rate for the 130,000 mt Nigeria/UK Continent voyage (TD20) climbed 9 points to WS120.28 meaning a daily round-trip TCE of $57,338 while the TD27 route (Guyana to UK Continent basis 130,000 mt) only rose 4 points to WS115.28 translating to a daily round trip TCE of $54,152 basis discharge in Rotterdam. The CPC terminal issues seem to be very much in the rearview, and the rate for the TD6 route of 135,000 mt CPC/Med has been steady this week at about the WS135 level showing a daily TCE of about $67,939 round-trip. In the Middle East, the rate for the TD23 route of 140,000 mt Middle East Gulf to the Mediterranean (via the Suez Canal) has continued to be steady at the WS91 level.\n\nAframax\n\nIn the North Sea, the rate for the 80,000 mt Cross-UK Continent route (TD7) has had 2 points added, reaching a whisker away from WS140, giving a daily round-trip TCE of $55,065 basis Hound Point to Wilhelmshaven.\n\nIn the Mediterranean market the rate for 80,000 mt Cross-Mediterranean (TD19) has slid down 8 points to WS181.11 (basis Ceyhan to Lavera, that shows a daily round trip TCE about $61,100).\n\nAcross the Atlantic, the peak has been reached, and rates have started to tumble. For the 70,000 mt East Coast Mexico/US Gulf route (TD26) and the 70,000 mt Covenas/US Gulf route (TD9) the rates are 28 and 27 points down since Thursday 17th April at about WS193 and WS190, respectively, which shows a daily round-trip TCE of around $52,500 and $48,100.\n\nThe rate for the trans-Atlantic route of 70,000 mt US Gulf/UK Continent (TD25) has had 17 points cut away this week to WS176.39 giving a round trip TCE basis Houston/Rotterdam of $46,507 per day.\n\nLNG\n\nThe LNG market showed a notable shift this week, with a strong recovery in the Atlantic basin while the Pacific was mixed.\n\nOn the BLNG1 Gladstone\u2013Tokyo route, 174k cbm vessels declined by $1,000, closing at $22,200 per day, while 160k cbm vessels edged up by $200, settling at $13,800 per day. The continued decline for larger vessels highlights ongoing sluggishness in Pacific demand.\n\nIn the Atlantic, rates surged across key routes. The BLNG2 Sabine\u2013UK Continent route jumped by $15,100 for 174k cbm vessels, reaching $36,500 per day, while 160k cbm vessels increased $7,300 to $19,200 per day. The BLNG3 Sabine\u2013Tokyo route also saw a strong rally, with 174k cbm vessels gaining $13,900 to $41,500 per day, and 160k cbm vessels rising $7,800 to $22,900 per day, reflecting a tightening Atlantic market and renewed demand.\n\nThe time charter market strengthened. Six-month charters rose by $3,200 to $31,050 per day, while one-year rates climbed by $1,325 to $34,400 per day. Three-year time charters also edged up by $550, reaching $53,850 per day, indicating improved confidence across the curve.\n\nLPG\n\nThe LPG market has been relatively quiet this week, following the hectic, tariff-driven pricing of recent weeks. Fixing activity has slowed noticeably, and while rates remain below pre-tariff levels, the pace of decline has eased. This may suggest a tentative stabilisation in the market, though underlying sentiment remains fragile.\n\nOn the BLPG1 Ras Tanura\u2013Chiba route, rates slipped by $2.26 to settle at $51.333, while TCE earnings fell $2,676, ending at $35,002/day. The decline was milder compared to recent weeks, with Middle East tonnage lists thinning slightly but not yet enough to lift sentiment.\n\nIn the Atlantic, the BLPG2 Houston\u2013Flushing route dropped $1.25 to $53.75, with TCEs down $1,963 to $53,316/day.\n\nThe BLPG3 Houston\u2013Chiba long-haul route also moved down, losing $1.67 to close at $101.667, with TCE earnings off $1,458, settling at $37,243/day. The arbitrage to the East remains under pressure along with excess freight, and without improvement the market is likely to remain static.\n\nContainer\n\nDespite some relaxation from original positions on port costs for Chinese built ships and an exemption of many electronics from reciprocal tariffs, the steep decline in China-US container trade continues. Many US-bound vessels are departing China half full as shippers cancel orders due to increased costs. Carriers are blanking sailings rapidly, reminiscent of the early pandemic period. Importers are relying on built-up inventories and bonded US warehouses to wait out the tariff hike. However, despite a slight increase in rates to the US from origins like Vietnam, prices from China have not collapsed despite reduced demand.\n\nFBX01\n\n(China/East Asia \u2013 USA West Coast) increased modestly by $35 ending the week at $2,327/FEU.\n\nFBX02\n\n(USA West Coast \u2013 China/East Asia) rates increased from $2,366/TEU to $2,407 at the end of the week.\n\nFBX03\n\n(China/East Asia \u2013 USA East Coast) remained mostly unchanged finishing the week at $3,395/FEU.\n\nFBX11\n\n(China/East Asia \u2013 Mediterranean) rates increased from $2,310/FEU, finishing the week at $2,355/FEU.\n\nFBX12\n\n(North Europe \u2013 China / East Asia) is unchanged at $462/TEU.\n\nFBX13\n\n(China/East Asia \u2013 Mediterranean) has fallen by $23/FEU finishing the week at $3,070/FEU.\n\nThis report is produced by the Baltic Exchange.

PHOTO: ST FILE\n\n[SINGAPORE] The Workers\u2019 Party (WP) pitches itself as a responsible opposition, but it will not take responsibility for proposals that \u201cturned out wrong\u201d, said Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat on Sunday (Apr 27) as he lashed out at Singapore\u2019s largest opposition party during a televised roundtable ahead of the May 3 general election.\n\nChee, who leads the People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) team in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, said the WP had, for example, recommended the government build much fewer HDB flats, when the resale market for public housing was soft before the Covid-19 pandemic hit.\n\n\u201cNow imagine if we had listened to what the Workers\u2019 Party had proposed, taken their advice, stopped building BTO (Build-To-Order) flats ahead of time, more Singaporeans will have to wait longer for their flats,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFortunately, we did not listen to that advice.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the government built ahead, and even amid pandemic-related disruptions, was \u201cworking very hard\u201d to build more than 100,000 flats to meet demand.\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cthey like to claim credit for policies that are implemented by the PAP\u201d, Chee charged.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nHe accused the WP of imitating PAP policies and positions, with improvisations that are \u201can occasional half step to the left or to the right, depending on how the wind blows because they want to score political points\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf you examine some of their proposals carefully, many of their proposals actually don\u2019t work. Their positions have been inconsistent, whether on GST (goods and services tax), on housing, on fiscal policies that eventually would end up eroding our reserves,\u201d he said.\n\nGiving another example, Chee said the WP had called for the removal of the statutory retirement age, as suggested by party chair Sylvia Lim at its rally the day before.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nGE2025: Fullerton rally among 6 election rallies to be held on Apr 28\n\nGE2025: Allianz-Income deal was done in good faith, says labour chief Ng Chee Meng\n\nGE2025: WP candidates represent all Singaporeans, not just their communities: Pritam Singh\n\nGE2025: Government needs strong mandate for global trade negotiations: PAP candidates\n\nMore\n\nThe minister said the intentions may be good but end up \u201cunintentionally causing more problems for the people you are trying to help\u201d.\n\nThis is because with the retirement age, employers cannot dismiss workers before they reach that age, Chee said.\n\nThe PAP takes a different approach \u2013 for example, Senior Employment Credits help encourage employers to hire senior workers.\n\nHe said Singapore has stayed exceptional because its politics is unique and \u201cenables good government and sound policies\u201d.\n\nThe question, he said, is whether Singapore can continue to uphold these standards and remain exceptional in this turbulent world.\n\nGeopolitics and economy\n\nThe 80-minute roundtable featured Chee and four opposition members: WP first-time candidate Michael Thng; Red Dot United (RDU) secretary-general Ravi Philemon; People\u2019s Alliance for Reform (PAR) secretary-general Lim Tean, and Progress Singapore Party (PSP) first-time candidate Stephanie Tan.\n\nThe first segment on geopolitics and economy focused on the individual parties\u2019 proposals to combat the impact of trade tensions and US tariffs.\n\nAmid the decline of the era of free trade, Lim said, Singapore has to cooperate with regional partners instead of relying on the US.\n\nTan also noted the need to build up local enterprises and innovate.\n\nOne way to strengthen domestic capabilities is by reducing the cost of doing business in Singapore, such as issuing national guidelines on rent increases for commercial properties, she said.\n\nPhilemon expects RDU\u2019s proposal to cut the GST from 9 per cent to 7 per cent will \u201cimmediately put more money into the pockets of people, and people will feel more confident, and they will consume more\u201d.\n\nThng said that Singapore is still part of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the Republic can seek deeper relationships with nations that remain friendly.\n\nHe noted opportunities to double down on industries that may have become more price competitive as a consequence of the trade war, such as the semiconductor industry.\n\nChee said that businesses, while worried about tariffs, are even more concerned about the uncertainty.\n\n\u201cSo they are unable to make investment decisions and hiring decisions, and this would then have an impact on the job market and on our workers,\u201d the minister said.\n\nChee, who is also Second Finance Minster, noted that a large part of the 2025 Budget is to help companies and workers stay competitive in the medium to longer term, on top of helping Singaporeans and business to cope with immediate concerns. He also noted there is a ministerial task force focused on growing the economy. \u201cWe have to look at reconfiguring our trade links, our supply chains, but importantly also to seek out new opportunities for our companies and our workers.\u201d\n\nSingapore also benefits from having a \u201cvery strong international reputation\u201d built up by the PAP since independence.\n\nCost of living\n\nAddressing the view that the hike in GST contributed to inflation, PAR\u2019s Lim said there was \u201cabsolutely no need for the GST hikes in the midst of a huge storm\u201d, especially since Singapore had a budget surplus in 2024.\n\nLim said the government receives enough revenue to finance the free healthcare, education and school meals in PAR\u2019s proposals.\n\nPhilemon said the budget surplus in the past two years could finance his party\u2019s proposal for a \u201ccitizen\u2019s dividend\u201d.\n\n\u201cWealth is not taxed enough,\u201d he said, noting the perception that the GST is aimed more at ordinary Singaporeans than at the wealthy and big companies.\n\nMeanwhile, WP\u2019s Thng said the GST was a \u201cwrong tool used at a wrong time\u201d. \u201cWe believe then and believe today that there were other methods, and there were other pathways to get the revenue we needed,\u201d he said.\n\nPSP\u2019s Tan said her party also has proposals to increase revenue for the government, such as a levy for Employment Passes, and its Affordable Home Scheme, where HDB will no longer need to pay land costs used for BTOs into the past reserves.\n\nResponding, Chee said that Singapore imports what it consumes, hence it also imports global inflation \u2013 something it cannot stop.\n\nTo counter this, Singapore maintains a strong Singapore dollar, which has helped mitigate the impact of imported inflation.\n\nThe government also had the assurance package and provided cost of living support, he added.\n\nChee said the PAP\u2019s view is that the current generation\u2019s needs should be covered by this generation, hence it should not borrow or gamble on savings and reserves of future generations.\n\n\u201cThis is why we decided to raise the GST. It was a difficult decision\u2026 because no government or political party likes to raise taxes, but we had to do so because we needed the additional revenue to support the healthcare needs of our seniors in an ageing population,\u201d he said.\n\nImmigration\n\nOn immigration, the candidates were largely of the view that Singaporeans should be prioritised even as they acknowledged that foreign talent is necessary.\n\nThng said it was necessary to ensure the immigration policy \u201clifts Singaporeans and not sidelines them\u201d, and one suggestion to achieve this is to ensure \u201cmore deliberate skills transfer between foreign talent and our local workforce\u201d.\n\nAsked how WP\u2019s proposal differs from existing frameworks, such as the Complementarity Assessment Framework, he said there are ways to ensure the transfer is measurable. For example, the government could require companies to invest in training for potential local employees or put in place mentorship programmes pairing local and foreign employees.\n\nTan said PSP has suggested strengthening the Fair Consideration Framework, which requires employers to consider the workforce without discrimination, as well as to impose a \u201cmodest\u201d Employment Pass levy and quota.\n\nLim said that PAR \u201cwill insist\u201d for employers to be permitted to hire foreigners only if they can show that no Singaporean is capable of doing a job.\n\nPhilemon noted that the US and Canada have legislation to ensure citizens are preferred over foreigners during employment, adding that this is what the party is calling for.\n\nChee said the government understands the concerns of workers but that Singapore needs to stay open to welcome complementary global talent.\n\nWhat the PAP will focus on, he said, is to put workers first by ensuring they remain relevant and employable, as well as to strengthen safety nets \u2013 and this is achieved through its strong model of tripartism, a \u201challmark of the PAP government\u201d.\n\nNo monopoly\n\nWrapping up the session, participants gave a two-minute pitch on why Singaporeans should vote for them.\n\nPhilemon said RDU is calling for \u201ca new social compact, collective prosperity, citizens dividend, a comprehensive housing reset, caring healthcare and civil liberties\u201d, in the face of growing inequality.\n\nLim asked Singaporeans to consider if they think their life will be better five years from now, if they continue to vote for the PAP.\n\nTan said PSP does not oppose for the sake of opposing and has supported the PAP government in passing legislation \u201cwhen it is in the national interest\u201d.\n\nThng said it was more important than ever \u2013 amid the growing global uncertainties \u2013 to build a system that will get the policies right.\n\n\u201cIn this context, there is far less margin for error and to get it right, we need more perspectives,\u201d he said.\n\nSingapore needs more voices to ensure that blind spots are not missed, and mistakes not made.\n\n\u201cAnd if we accept that no one has a monopoly on good ideas, which I think we all do, then maybe none of us should have a monopoly in Parliament,\u201d said Thng.\n\nChee said he agreed that \u201cthere will not be a monopoly\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no chance of the government having a blank cheque, but we must also not give the opposition a free pass,\u201d he said. \u201cMake the PAP work harder, but also make the opposition work harder for you.\u201d\n\nFor more election coverage, visit our\n\nGE2025 microsite\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

If the trade war persists, the next upheaval will hit much closer to home.\n\nSince the US raised levies on China to 145 per cent in early April, cargo shipments have plummeted, perhaps by as much as 60 per cent, according to one estimate. That drastic reduction in goods from one of the largest US trading partners has not been felt by many Americans yet, but that\u2019s about to change.\n\nBy the middle of May, thousands of companies \u2013 big and small \u2013 will be needing to replenish inventories. Giant retailers such as Walmart and Target told Trump in a meeting last week that shoppers are likely to see empty shelves and higher prices. Torsten Slok, Apollo Management\u2019s chief economist, recently warned of looming \u201cCovid-like\u201d shortages and significant layoffs in industries spanning trucking, logistics and retail.\n\nWhile Trump has shown signs in recent days that he\u2019s willing to be flexible on the import taxes imposed on China and others, it may be too late to stop a supply shock from reverberating across the US economy that could stretch all the way to Christmas.\n\n\u201cThe clock is absolutely ticking,\u201d said Jim Gerson, president of The Gersons Companies, an 84-year-old supplier of holiday decorations and candles to major US retailers. The company, based in Olathe, Kansas, sources more than half its products from China and currently has about 250 containers waiting to be shipped.\n\n\u201cWe have to get this worked out,\u201d said Gerson, who\u2019s part of the third generation from his family to run the company, which generates roughly US$100 million in sales a year. \u201cAnd hopefully very soon.\u201d\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nEven when hostilities ease, restarting transpacific trade will bring additional risks.

A similar scenario unfolded during the pandemic when container prices quadrupled and a glut of cargo ships jammed up ports.\n\n\u201cThere will be a surge in ports and consequently for trucks and rail creating delays and bottlenecks,\u201d said Lars Jensen, chief executive officer of shipping consultant Vespucci Maritime. \u201cPorts are designed for stable flows, not the off-again, on-again volume shifts.\u201d\n\nThe US tariffs on China came at a critical time for the retail industry. March and April is when suppliers start ramping up inventory for the second half of the year to fill orders for back-to-school shopping and Christmas. For many firms, the first holiday goods should be hitting the water bound for the US in roughly two weeks.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nChina vows to ready emergency plans, signals calm amid trade war\n\nChina waives tariffs on some US goods, but denies Trump\u2019s claim that talks are underway\n\nChina\u2019s investments in South-east Asia snarl US plans on supply chains\n\nJapan to resist Trump efforts to form trade bloc against China\n\nBeijing says claims of ongoing US-China trade talks \u2018groundless\u2019\n\nMore\n\n\u201cWe are paralysed,\u201d said Jay Foreman, CEO of toymaker Basic Fun in Boca Raton, Florida, which supplies big retail customers such as Amazon.com and Walmart. He called the tariffs a \u201cde facto embargo\u201d and said customers have been pausing orders so far, but he expects them to start cancelling them if the China tariffs stay at this level for much longer.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a couple weeks, then it really starts to hurt,\u201d said Foreman, whose company generates about US$200 million in sales a year and sources roughly 90 per cent of products from China. \u201cWe are in a period where the damage is manageable, but every week the damage level is going to increase.\u201d\n\nSupply shock\n\nThe leading edge of that supply jolt is evident in Asia. There are currently about 40 cargo ships that recently stopped at ports in China and are now bound for the US, down by about 40 per cent from early April, according to ship tracking compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThose vessels are carrying about 320,000 containers, according to the data, about a third fewer than just after Trump announced he was raising tariffs on almost all goods from China to 145 per cent.\n\nJudah Levine, head of research at cargo booking platform Freightos, said a lot of US importers will be front-loading orders from other American trading partners through the 90-day reprieve on Trump\u2019s so-called reciprocal tariffs. That could help cushion any China-centric shock through ports and logistics networks.\n\nWith Chinese merchandise too pricey, some cargo owners in the US are turning to suppliers in South-east Asia.\n\nHapag-Lloyd, the world\u2019s fifth-largest container carrier, said in an e-mailed statement last week that it\u2019s seeing cancellations of about 30 per cent of bookings from China to the US. But business is sharply up from exporters in Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam, the Hamburg, Germany-based company said.\n\nHowever, the whiplash effect on the economy still might be difficult to navigate in the months ahead, Levine said.\n\n\u201cIt is likely there will be a significant slowdown,\u201d he said. And \u201cthe restart could cause some congestion, with the strength of the rebound and resulting disruption probably correlated to the length of the pause\u201d.\n\nWith demand for goods from China to the US sinking fast, cargo carriers have slashed capacity to keep ocean freight rates from cratering. In April, there were about 80 cancelled sailings from China to the US, roughly 60 per cent more than any month during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to figures cited by John McCown, a veteran industry executive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fair statement to say that the container shipping sector has never faced the sort of macro headwinds that it is now facing,\u201d McCown said in a recent research note.\n\nThe World Trade Organization has warned that goods traded between the US and China could decrease by as much as 80 per cent, backing US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent\u2019s description of the current situation as essentially a trade embargo.\n\nThe uncertainty is partly why economists say a US recession is almost a coin flip. Forecasters surveyed by Bloomberg expect imports to fall at a 7 per cent annual rate in the second quarter \u2013 which would be the biggest drop since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nThe looming supply shock has prompted economists to revise up their inflation forecasts because it could push prices higher. Executives say price tags on goods from China could double on some items. And that would come at a time when consumer sentiment is deteriorating sharply.\n\nIf America\u2019s trade war with China goes on for a few more weeks, suppliers and retailers will have to make some hard decisions about the second half of the year, including which goods to ship and how much to raise prices.\n\nSuppliers are expecting lots of orders to be cancelled. That will push retailers to scour the US and other markets for goods to fill their shelves, even if they are from last Christmas.\n\nIt\u2019s also going to be a big financial hit that many companies will likely respond to by cutting costs, including jobs, or taking on pricey debt.\n\nFor Foreman, the past few weeks reminds him of the pandemic, but there are key differences. The Covid-19 lockdown was a shock, but global supply chains bounced back relatively quickly and several sectors, including toys, ended up having record years.\n\nThis has the potential to be \u201cmore treacherous because the longer this goes, the more catastrophic this is\u201d, he said. Covid-19 was also littered with lots of unknowns about the virus and how long it would take to rebound. This dilemma could be eased by Trump removing the levies at any time.\n\n\u201cThe lingering effects could be worse,\u201d Foreman said. \u201cBut the solution could come much faster.\u201d BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWhat's moving the markets?

S&P also pointed to more than A$100 billion (S$84 billion) in \u201coff-budget\u201d spending that\u2019s expected between fiscal 2025 and 2029 to reinforce its fiscal concerns.\n\nGoldman Sachs said last week that Australia\u2019s fiscal policy is likely to be more expansionary under the centre-right opposition than the ruling Labor Party, highlighting the proliferation of election spending promises.\n\n\u201cSound fiscal management across multiple governments over several decades underpins our \u2018AAA\u2019 rating on Australia,\u201d the S&P analysts said. \u201cSound fiscal outcomes have ensured Australia\u2019s debt metrics remain a key rating strength.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s fiscal balance is projected to tip back into deficit in the year-ending June 2025, after two consecutive surpluses.

PHOTO: AFP\n\n[WASHINGTON] When Stephen Miller left the White House in 2021, the key adviser to Donald Trump turned in his badge with a parting quip: \u201cI will see you in four years.\u201d\n\nAlmost immediately, Miller and a cadre of loyalists set about devising a flurry of actions and orders they\u2019d unleash if the 45th president was able to mount a comeback.\n\nThe fine print was later drawn up in a nondescript building in West Palm Beach, the nerve centre of Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign and, eventually, the transition. A floor-to-ceiling likeness of Trump \u2013 bearing the words \u201cWelcome to the Thunderdome\u201d \u2013 covered one wall.\n\nThe team repackaged some of Trump\u2019s first-term priorities to make them more likely to become entrenched. And they were girded for legal fights they expected, if not sought \u2013 in part thanks to the work of conservative groups founded by Miller and other Trump allies after his 2020 election loss.\n\nThat preparation, described by sources familiar with the process, enabled what has been a defining feature of the first 100 days of Trump\u2019s second term: A breakneck speed that is both one of the administration\u2019s most effective tools and most glaring vulnerabilities.\n\nIt allowed Trump to put his black Sharpie signature on a dizzying number of executive orders on everything from energy to education and diversity efforts that have overwhelmed opponents of his Maga agenda and exploited the slow-moving nature of court challenges. Senior administration officials tout their rapidly enacted immigration policies as helping to dramatically slow illegal crossings at the US Southern border.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nBut the quick tempo has also sent the administration hurtling towards economic and political peril. The president\u2019s hastily implemented and frequently revised tariff policies have sown deep uncertainty among trading partners and in financial markets. Economists say the levies have increased the odds of a US recession \u2013 a potentially devastating blow to credibility for a president who reclaimed the White House on the promise of taming price increases and delivering prosperity.\n\n\u201cThe president was elected to tackle the border crisis and to address the economy,\u201d said Marc Short, a first-term Trump aide. \u201cOne he is doing well and one he is not.\u201d\n\nAnother signature effort, Elon Musk\u2019s Doge cost-cutting campaign, has fuelled chaos as it moved rapidly to fire thousands of government employees and gut a raft of programmes, including initiatives some Republicans would have preferred to keep.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nUS not ready to lower tariff on imports from Singapore, but agrees to explore way forward: DPM Gan\n\nUS pharma tariffs would raise US drug costs by US$51 billion annually, report finds\n\nChina vows to ready emergency plans, signals calm amid trade war\n\nChina waives tariffs on some US goods, but denies Trump\u2019s claim that talks are underway\n\nChina\u2019s investments in South-east Asia snarl US plans on supply chains\n\nMore\n\nNow Trump faces the enormous challenge of implementing the cavalcade of executive orders he has enacted, a task that is likely to be especially daunting when the ranks of staff remain thin at key agencies such as Treasury, Commerce and the Energy Department.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice that they are moving quickly, but this is going to take persistent effort for all of the four years,\u201d said Ben Lieberman, a senior fellow with the Competitive Enterprise Institute.\n\nTrump\u2019s aggressive pace is accompanied by greater confidence in his political instincts and an inner circle even more stocked than last time with loyalists. That combination has left him emboldened to test the limits of executive power like never before, such as his exploration of whether he can fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell \u2013 an idea he appears to have backed away from.\n\nTrump and his team say they have learned lessons from the first term about who to hire and how to effectively ingrain their agenda \u2013 even as polls offer warning signs that his moves so far are weighing on his popularity.  Trump heads to Michigan on Tuesday (Apr 29) to tout his manufacturing agenda and 100-day blitz.\n\n\u201cWe are setting records right now \u2013 we are getting more things approved than any president has ever done in the first 100 days; it\u2019s not even close,\u201d Trump said in an Apr 8 speech. \u201cAnd we are going to continue that way, if not more so.\u201d\n\nFeedback loop of affirmation\n\nTrump has slipped comfortably back into the trappings of the presidency. He spends time cloistered in the White House and decamps nearly every weekend to Palm Beach, humming with Maga acolytes and administration officials. Trump observed a strike on the Houthis from a temporary situation room set up at the golf club.\n\nHe remains a voracious consumer of cable television and has been listening to podcasts when he cannot sleep, including one on the Civil War and another by his crypto adviser, David Sacks, according to a source familiar with his habits.\n\nOne former president is occupying his mind: William McKinley, who as a member of Congress rolled out tariffs on the scale Trump is now contemplating. McKinley\u2019s tariffs were widely seen as unpopular. To Trump, though, they made America rich.\n\nTrump\u2019s trade agenda is part of his larger plan to drastically overhaul how the federal government does business and to reject what he sees as failures of the existing world order, said one senior administration official.\n\nTariffs have been a rare issue to pierce what is often a feedback loop of affirmation for Trump that includes his top advisers and Cabinet leaders. US automakers won a reprieve from levies after appealing to Trump, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent largely has taken over talks with trading partners after Trump paused them to stem a market rout.\n\nDespite that key role for Bessent, tariff hawk Peter Navarro still occupies a special place in the Trump orbit. Trump views the Harvard-trained economist as one of his most loyal aides after Navarro served four months in jail for defying a subpoena to testify about the Jan 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol.\n\nTrump aides and allies have downplayed the 100-day milestone \u2013 they insist the pace will not abate and cast it as an artificial metric. One senior administration official said there are many other initiatives, particularly on culture war issues, that the Trump team has yet to unveil.\n\nBut Trump himself has hinted he\u2019s not exactly ignoring the measure.\n\nIn a rally a day before his inauguration, he promised \u201cthe best first day, the biggest first week, and the most extraordinary first 100 days of any presidency in American history\u201d.\n\nFlood the zone\n\nPerhaps the most frenzied day of the second Trump administration came on Apr 9, when the president made a surprise announcement that he would pause most of the sweeping so-called reciprocal tariffs that had gone into effect roughly 13 hours earlier, while further raising the rate on China. The retreat fed a euphoric rally in a stock market that had just plunged close to bear-market territory.\n\nYet on that hugely consequential day, the president quickly turned to another subject close to his heart \u2013 or, at least his head \u2013 when he signed an executive order directing the repeal of conservation standards that limit showerhead water flows.\n\n\u201cI have to stand under the shower for 15 minutes until it gets wet,\u201d he complained to reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cIt comes out \u2013 drip, drip, drip \u2013 it\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\nThe moment reflected the flood-the-zone strategy Miller has encouraged, with the president ping-ponging from his global-order-busting tariff policy to something seemingly so mundane. And the policy itself puts in sharp relief the administration\u2019s wider strategy for executive orders.\n\nTrump, who has said the curbs on water pressure make it difficult to wash his \u201cbeautiful hair\u201d, had already tried to unwind the limits during his first term. Those 2020 changes were reversed under former president Joe Biden \u2013 and Trump\u2019s advisers had been plotting a redo ever since.\n\nThis time, they came prepared, armed with plans to get the regulatory pivot in motion right away. The order Trump signed this month includes a controversial \u2013 and legally risky \u2013 gambit to expedite the change by waiving requirements that significant regulatory shifts be accompanied by public notice and comment periods. Instead, Trump declared in his order: Such \u201cnotice and comment is unnecessary because I am ordering the repeal\u201d.\n\nIt was classic second-term Trump \u2013 using an executive order to address a grievance and unfinished business from his first four years, while testing the bounds of presidential authority in novel ways.\n\nAnd, it was in keeping with a message delivered repeatedly to officials and lawyers who have helped draft executive orders. Instead of questioning whether something can be done, ask why cannot we do it, said a source familiar with the matter.\n\nTrump has used executive orders to push the limits of the power of his office, invoking emergency powers and national security concerns to impose tariffs, deport foreigners in the US, freeze federal funding in defiance of Congress and strip security clearances from law firms with ties to political opponents. Many of Trump\u2019s orders also seek to extend the reach of the federal government well beyond Washington, directing Justice Department probes and mandates that have prompted changes from statehouses to corporate boardrooms.\n\nCritics say some of Trump\u2019s orders are blatantly contrary to federal law. But that may be a feature \u2013 not a bug \u2013 for administration officials and advocates who have openly relished the opportunity for Supreme Court rulings on the president\u2019s power.\n\n\u2018Intellectual godfathers\u2019\n\nThe roadmap for Trump\u2019s second act has been years in the making. Allies in 2021 launched the influential America First Policy Institute think tank and Miller created America First Legal in a bid to avoid the legal pitfalls of the first term. Two years later, the Heritage Foundation published Project 2025. All three groups, along with a wider constellation of think tanks, policy analysts and lawyers, effectively stocked ready-made policy options that were designed in response to Trump\u2019s public remarks to deliver on his vision.\n\n\u201cPreparation is key, and in some cases, preparation is king,\u201d said Chad Wolf, a former top Trump official who\u2019s now executive vice-president of America First Policy Institute.\n\nMike McKenna, a former White House adviser under Trump, said it was largely a trio of \u201cintellectual godfathers\u201d teeing up the next term: Miller, longtime Trump whisperer (and occasional public critic) Steve Bannon, and trade adviser Navarro.\n\nAs Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign heated up, his allies used that scaffolding. Conservatives aligned with the Heritage Foundation held dozens of listening sessions with hundreds of experts and representatives from key industries, including health care, finance, energy and agriculture. The events were run like focus groups, with leaders helping coax participants to go beyond outlining routine policy wish lists to share more original and innovative ideas. The sessions led to policy recommendations, but, just as importantly, said one participant, served to knit together a network, with some of the experts now serving in the administration.\n\nMeanwhile, teams of conservative lawyers, former government officials and think tank representatives across Washington were drafting potential language to implement policy changes, including unfinished business from Trump\u2019s first term. The effort spanned subjects from energy to financial services, with participants going beyond just writing executive orders to developing the framework of other key regulatory documents, according to sources familiar with the initiative.\n\nNot every major Trump effort has had extensive groundwork. A White House official conceded that Doge, the Musk-led project to remake the federal government, was an effort that took shape throughout the first 100 days, on the fly. Musk\u2019s moves sometimes surprised and dismayed administration officials, who were not always kept abreast of his plans and who did not always agree with his tactics, like locking federal workers out of offices for show.\n\nThat may help explain why its ambitions appear to have narrowed. Musk once mused about finding US$2 trillion in savings, but he\u2019s since floated a US$150 billion target.\n\nTransition team\n\nAfter Trump defeated Biden in November, Miller and another policy aide, Vince Haley, led the effort on orders and presidential memos, helping to ensure a flurry of actions awaited Trump\u2019s signature hours after the inauguration. The transition policy team also included Russ Vought, Mark Paoletta and May Mailman \u2013 all veterans of Trump\u2019s first term \u2013 who helped shape the executive orders, sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe transition team purposefully did not let the Cabinet picks know the full extent of the plans, so they could avoid them coming into play in confirmation hearings, one Trump adviser said. Meanwhile, a separate team of aggressive, online-centric operatives mapped out a strategy to ensure even the most controversial nominees got confirmed by the Senate. They threatened to bully and mount primary challenges for any lawmaker who did not comply.\n\nVice-President JD Vance served as a key conduit to Capitol Hill during contentious confirmation processes.\n\nVance and the entire White House team are \u201creturning calls, they are reaching out, they are initiating conversation and they are not letting you be surprised by what is going to happen\u201d, said Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn.\n\nMany of the aides who arrived in Washington with Trump had worked on his campaign, helping make his operation more cohesive than last time. His chief of staff, Susie Wiles, holds clear authority \u2013 a contrast to early in Trump\u2019s first term when Reince Priebus, Jared Kushner and Bannon were competing centres of power.\n\nTrump\u2019s top advisers are also committed to swiftly translating the president\u2019s policy utterances into reality. The dynamic means asides in speeches or quips to reporters can rapidly form the basis of new policy \u2013 but also add to the workload for staff tasked with developing new initiatives instead of focusing on long-term administration priorities.\n\nTake, for instance, Trump\u2019s surprise commitment at an Apr 8 event to offer government guarantees meant to keep coal companies in business despite political shifts in Washington. Trump confessed he\u2019d just come up with the idea \u201cabout 15 minutes before I got up here\u201d, but staff were already working on it.\n\nLooking abroad\n\nTrump has told aides he\u2019s delighted with the early pace, hanging photos of his order-signings through the West Wing.\n\nStill, some of his pledges abroad have fallen flat \u2013 his promised swift end to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has not materialised, there\u2019s little to show for his vow to confront Iran and he\u2019s expressed misgivings about the outcome so far of the hostage deal between Hamas and Israel that he once took credit for. One official summarised his next 100 days in four words: trade deals, peace deals.\n\nAt home, the \u201cone, big, beautiful bill\u201d to overhaul taxes is a core part of his plan for the border, and to offset the economic headwind of his tariffs. However, it\u2019s anything but a sure thing to pass and could add trillions to the budget deficit.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are grappling with how to counter it \u2013 and Trump himself.\n\n\u201cWe have to have the backs of the American people and focus on showing how we can deliver the things that he\u2019s not delivering, the unkept promises,\u201d said Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Democrats should also highlight Trump\u2019s clashes with courts and attempts to expand presidential authority, she said. \u201cBut most of the people out there in my state are talking to me about the economy.\u201d\n\nPolling suggests her party may have an opening there, with a majority of voters disapproving of Trump\u2019s handling of the economy. The president will likely use his Tuesday appearance in Michigan to try to bolster his standing on this issue, talking up his vision to use tariffs to bring manufacturing back to the US.\n\n\u201cThey want to continue to push the envelope, and they want to do more, and they want to do better,\u201d said AFPI\u2019s Wolf. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think they are quite satisfied yet.\u201d BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nGlobal\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:54 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nChina biotech\u2019s stunning advance is changing the world\u2019s drug pipeline\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG\n\nPublished Mon, Apr 28, 2025 \u00b7 08:04 AM\n\n[NEW YORK] The \u201cSell America\u201d trade that gripped markets this month has left a potentially lasting dent in investors\u2019 willingness to hold the US government\u2019s longest-maturity debt, a mainstay of its deficit-financing toolkit.\n\nFor bond managers at BlackRock, Brandywine Global Investment Management and Vanguard Group, the problem is that as US President Donald Trump approaches his 100th day in office, he has generated a growing lists of unknowns, forcing traders to focus on a broad array of issues beyond just the likely path of interest rates.\n\nTo name a few: What do Trump\u2019s trade war, tax-cut agenda and scattergun policymaking mean for already weakening economic growth, sticky inflation and massive fiscal shortfalls? Will he again threaten to fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell? Is he actively seeking a weaker US dollar?\n\nThe result is a heightened notion of risk that\u2019s leading bond buyers to question the traditional haven status of US government debt and require higher yields on longer maturities. By one measure, that added cushion, which traders dub the term premium, is around the highest since 2014.\n\n\u201cWe are in a new world order,\u201d said Jack McIntyre, who with his team oversees US$63 billion at Brandywine. \u201cEven if Trump backpedals on the tariffs, I think uncertainty levels are still going to be elevated. So that means term premium stays elevated.\u201d\n\nOf course, some of the angst around Treasuries could well fade should Trump strike trade deals or continue to signal that he\u2019s wary of a full-fledged rout in bonds. But as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent prepares to unveil the government\u2019s latest borrowing plans on Wednesday, he faces the added task of calming investors grappling with a growing host of concerns.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nAll the uncertainty is leading McIntyre to stay roughly neutral to his benchmark. It\u2019s also changing how he sees the long bond behaving in the event of an economic slowdown. In a nutshell, he says yields would remain higher than he\u2019d otherwise expect.\n\nNo flight\n\nIt\u2019s not as if investors are fleeing Treasuries wholesale. JPMorgan Asset Management sees them as a better bet than European government bonds. And this month\u2019s 30-year Treasury auction showed that there\u2019s an appetite for the maturity \u2013 at the right price. The result allayed fears of a buyers\u2019 strike, and long-bond yields have eased back from their recent peak.\n\nSentiment, however, remains fragile. For example, while Trump last week said he had \u201cno intention\u201d of firing Powell, his criticism of the Fed chair leaves some investors worrying about the central bank\u2019s independence.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nFrom rubber ducks to 401(k)s, Trump voters feel tariff pain but most see long-term gain\n\nAsia gains lead in race for interim deals to avoid Trump tariffs\n\nUS having daily talks with China over tariffs: US Agriculture secretary\n\n\u2018Welcome to the Thunderdome\u2019: Inside 100 dizzying days of Trump\n\nMore\n\nPacific Investment Management, which likened this month\u2019s episode of triple-weakening in the US dollar, US stocks and Treasuries to something one might expect in emerging markets, has also been buying Treasuries. But it\u2019s been limiting how far out the yield curve it goes. The US$2 trillion bond manager currently favours maturities from five to 10 years.\n\nThere are other signs of investor anxiety around the long bond, after adjusting for inflation, 30-year yields this month reached the highest since the financial crisis. Although they have since receded, they remain higher than when Trump announced his plan for sweeping tariffs on Apr 2.\n\nFor Vanguard, there\u2019s scope for the extra insurance being built into longer maturities to swell further, especially if widening federal deficits lead to more bond issuance.\n\n\u201cTerm premium is no longer low, but you can\u2019t make a case that it\u2019s historically high,\u201d said Rebecca Venter, senior fixed-income product manager at the roughly US$10 trillion asset manager. \u201cWhen you see the fiscal risks in the background, term premium can build over time.\u201d\n\nVanguard expects US growth below 1 per cent this year, which would be the weakest since 2020, and Venter said: \u201cThat does not bode well for the US budget deficit\u201d.\n\nNext chapter\n\nWhen the Treasury releases its latest bond issuance plans this week, Wall Street expects steady auction sizes over the next three months. With Republicans debating how to pay for their tax-cut bill, the fiscal story is the next chapter for the term premium.\n\nOne reason a fatter premium matters is that every fraction of a percentage point in extra yield counts for the government at a time when it\u2019s paying upwards of US$1 trillion per year to service its debt.\n\nAt BlackRock, which oversees almost US$12 trillion, the broad slide across US asset classes earlier this month magnified its concerns around the government\u2019s finances post-pandemic, and how US bonds were vulnerable to shifting investor confidence.\n\nThe sell-off in US markets \u201csuggests a desire for more compensation for risk and brought that fragile equilibrium into sharp focus\u201d, BlackRock Investment Institute said in a report.\n\nGeorge Catrambone at DWS Americas sees how the term premium might recede, but only so far, given all the shifting signals out of the White House on tariffs and other policies.\n\n\u201cOnce greater clarity is given and agreements are reached, I\u2019d expect term premium to abate,\u201d said the firm\u2019s head of fixed income. \u201cAlthough not back to the lows of the past decade as fiscal will be an ever-present concern.\u201d BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWhat's moving the markets?

Overnight, the ducks\u2019 cost jumped from 29 to 45 cents apiece, according to Egan.\n\nThat order is now on hold by the customer until the tariff situation is resolved, along with orders from other clients for thousands of other items, from hats to poker chips.\n\n\u201cI kind of feel like we\u2019re back in Covid times because everything\u2019s in limbo,\u201d said Egan, 64, who voted for Trump in November.\n\nHis first-quarter sales in 2025 were 70 per cent lower than the previous year, although they ticked up in April. Trump\u2019s barrage of tariffs against global trading partners has reverberated around the United States over the past few months, affecting the livelihoods of myriad Americans, including many who said they voted for him.\n\nTariffs were the most common policy cited by 25 Trump voters across the country interviewed by Reuters about the president\u2019s first 100 days in office and what had most impacted their lives.

Those timelines ranged from a few months to several years, reflecting the varying degrees of confidence these voters have in the president they helped elect.\n\nThe 25 voters were selected from 429 respondents to a February 2025 Ipsos poll who said they voted for Trump in November\u2019s presidential election and were willing to speak to a reporter.\n\nAlthough not a statistically representative portrait of all Trump voters, their ages, education backgrounds, races/ethnicities, locations and voting histories roughly corresponded to those of Trump\u2019s overall electorate.\n\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that \u201ceveryday Americans\u201d remembered how tariffs during Trump\u2019s first presidential term had helped drive economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe entire Trump administration is aligned on once again delivering a historic economy while continuing to secure our southern border and streamline our bloated government,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWhat would change my mind\u201d\n\nAt a Walmart in northeastern Indiana, retail worker Jon Webber, 44, said his employee stock value dropped and fewer people seemed to be buying luxury items \u2013 which usually see a surge in the spring \u2013 soon after Trump began issuing tariffs against China and other countries in February.\n\nWebber said he agreed with Trump that the government needed to \u201cstart making everybody kind of pay their own due,\u201d referring to the president\u2019s claims that other countries have \u201ctaken advantage\u201d of the United States in trade deals by setting tariffs at higher rates than those imposed on them by the US government.\n\nStill, if by early fall the tariffs aren\u2019t yielding economic benefits and the president hasn\u2019t fulfilled other campaign-trail pledges such as expanding US oil and gas production, \u201cthat would be what would change my mind to say, \u2018maybe Trump doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing\u2019,\u201d Webber said.\n\nThe 25 per cent tariff on auto imports that Trump announced on April 2 caused a buying surge at the Denver-area dealership where Ron Dailey, 63, sells mainly Japan-made cars, as customers raced to purchase vehicles before higher prices kicked in. The uncertainty sown by the tariffs has upset some of his colleagues, Dailey said.\n\nDailey said he trusts that Trump knows what he\u2019s doing with the tariffs, however. \u201cI\u2019ve seen my retirement portfolio affected by what\u2019s going on, but I\u2019m trying to see the bigger picture, that it\u2019s not just about me,\u201d he said.\n\nOnly one in five respondents in the Reuters/Ipsos poll that ended on Monday agreed that \u201cin general, when the US charges tariffs on imported goods, it is good for me personally.\u201d\n\nFederal cuts, border security\n\nWhile tariffs dominated views of Trump\u2019s first 100 days, they were hardly the only thing on his voters\u2019 minds.\n\nIn Prescott Valley, Arizona, Joyce Kenney, 73, has been glad to see the Trump administration deporting immigrants it has flagged as criminals and gang members. \u201cI wish the Democrats would keep their nose out of it and let us do what we voted on,\u201d she said, referring to legal efforts to pause some of the deportations.\n\nAmanda Taylor, 51, hasn\u2019t seen any changes to her work at an insurance firm near Savannah, Georgia, though she said her husband\u2019s federal government job has become more uncertain due to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts to the federal workforce.\n\nShe hoped Trump would improve the economy when she voted for him in November, but now she views his tariffs with mounting concern while \u201ctrying to trust the process.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why Trump, you know, puts tariffs in and then rolls them back right away. That\u2019s a little odd,\u201d she said.\n\nSome of the voters interviewed by Reuters said they would give Trump as long as it took for his tariffs to improve the US economy.\n\n\u201cHe has four years for me to prove himself,\u201d said Kate Mottl, 62, a secretary at a police department in the Chicago suburbs. \u201cI know that people are concerned about the stock market dropping as drastically as it did, but it\u2019s also been coming back up.\u201d\n\nBut the price hikes and market swings set off by the tariffs are already causing a few who helped elect Trump voter\u2019s remorse. \u201cYeah, I voted for him, but I felt like at the time he was better than the alternative,\u201d said Egan, the Tampa-based product distributor who was trying to buy rubber ducks. \u201cAnd now I sit here and go, \u2018who else do we have to choose from?\u2019\u201d\n\nEgan had been planning to buy some rural property in anticipation of his imminent retirement. After the hit to his business and investments, however, he might \u201cput that major purchase on hold for a few months and see how things go through the summer,\u201d he said.

He used the platform to reach out to the English-educated office crowd and thus bypass the media, which he thought portrayed the PAP then as \u201cextremists\u201d.\n\nThe PAP\u2019s lunchtime rally at Fullerton Square in 1959. PHOTO: ST FILE\n\nFrom the 1950s to the 1980s, the rally was a fixture that attracted a large lunchtime crowd, with people huddled together, shoulder to shoulder, to hear Lee speak.\n\nThe Straits Times\n\n\u2019 archives show that rallies such as this drew large crowds in the past, as the only way for voters to hear and see the candidates in person.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nIn 1980, despite a drizzle, a crowd gathered to hear Lee speak on the hot topic of succession.

But attempts to find an alternative site were unsuccessful.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nGE2025: Reject racial, religious identity politics, uphold multiracial unity, says SM Lee\n\nGE2025: WP will not take responsibility for proposals that \u2018turned out wrong\u2019: Chee Hong Tat\n\nGE2025: Allianz-Income deal was done in good faith, says labour chief Ng Chee Meng\n\nGE2025: Fullerton rally among 6 election rallies to be held on Apr 28\n\nMore\n\nIt was retained as a rally site just days before the election in December 1984.\n\nLee Hsien Loong speaking at the PAP\u2019s rally at Fullerton Square during his first election in 1984. PHOTO: LEE HSIEN LOONG/FACEBOOK\n\nThe first time the rally was skipped was in 1991, when Fullerton Square was not on the list of approved rally sites by the police.\n\nThe area had been landscaped, with a small park and circular road replacing the old carpark rally site.\n\nThe rally was also halted in October 2001, due to security concerns following the Sep 11 terrorist attacks in the United States that year.\n\nMost recently, the Covid-19 pandemic put paid to in-person rallies, with then Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong holding a virtual lunchtime rally instead in 2020.\n\nWhen was the last lunchtime rally held?\n\nThe last Fullerton rally was held in 2015, five years before the pandemic curtailed all in-person campaign events.\n\nIt turned out to be the last as prime minister for Lee, who is now Senior Minister, after having served as PM from 2004 to 2024.\n\nThen Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong greeting supporters at the PAP\u2019s lunchtime rally in Boat Quay on Sep 8, 2015.

In an unexpected turn of events, then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said at the Fullerton rally that he was so determined to stop Tang from stepping into Parliament that he was personally entering the battle for Cheng San GRC.\n\nTHE STRAITS TIMES\n\nFor more election coverage, visit our\n\nGE2025 microsite\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWhat's moving the markets?

PHOTO: AFP\n\n20250428 - chartpoint28 - TEOH copy (1).pdf\n\nDanish Lim Zhi Lin\n\nPublished Mon, Apr 28, 2025 \u00b7 07:00 AM\n\nTHE Nikkei 225 Index Futures contract, available in standard, mini, and micro sizes, tracks the Nikkei 225 Index which includes top constituents such as Fast Retailing (Uniqlo), Tokyo Electron (semiconductor equipment), and Advantest (semiconductor testing solutions).\n\nJapanese equities have seen a correction over the past month, weighed down by US tariffs that disproportionately affected export-oriented firms such as Toyota, Tokyo Electron, and Fast Retailing. However, the Nikkei 225 appears to have stabalised around the April low of 30,650.\n\nWhile tariffs remain a significant challenge, especially with the US being Japan\u2019s largest export market, there is optimism for upside potential if bilateral negotiations progress and trade deals are inked. US officials have hinted at prioritising Japan in upcoming trade talks, raising the likelihood of targeted tariff relief or exemptions. If such a scenario materialises, Japanese equities may lead a regional rebound.\n\nIn addition, recent developments also indicate a possible softening of US trade rhetoric. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the tariff standoff between US and China is \u201cunsustainable\u201d and that tensions could de-escalate in the coming months, though a comprehensive agreement may take two to three years. Separately, Trump also hinted at reducing tariffs significantly from current levels. While formal negotiations are pending, markets are likely to begin pricing in the potential for near-term relief.\n\nOn the macro front, rising real wages in Japan are fuelling hopes for a sustainable wage-price spiral, which could drive consumer spending and demand-led inflation. At the corporate level, structural reforms and increased shareholder activism have led to higher dividends and record share buybacks, which could offset some of the impact from tariffs.\n\nHowever, a stronger Japanese yen due to safe-haven demand and the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy normalisation could cap near-term upside. The historically negative correlation between USD/JPY and the Nikkei 225 remains a key dynamic to watch as a stronger yen tends to weigh on export-oriented equities.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nDespite the market turbulence over the past month, the structural bull case for Japan equities remains intact. Key drivers include improving corporate profits, corporate governance reform, shareholder activism, unwinding of crossholdings, tax-free investing via the Nippon Individual Savings Account which is\u00a0meant to help residents in Japan save money with tax-exempt benefits, and the return of healthy inflation and real wage growth.\n\nNikkei 225 technical outlook\n\nIn our view, we believe Japanese equities are well-positioned to benefit from a potential easing of tariff risks, accompanied by strong domestic fundamentals. If momentum holds and tariff risks are repriced lower, the Nikkei 225 could emerge as one of the early leaders in a broader Asia-Pacific recovery.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nJapan's Nikkei notches best week in 3 months on trade deal hopes\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, there is presence of a rebound from the Apr 7 low of 30,650 as shown on the daily chart of the Osaka Nikkei 225 Mini Futures contract.\n\nBased on a Fibonacci Extension drawn from the August 2024 low to the January 2025 high, and April 2025 low, the index is currently set to test the 50 per cent extension level near 35,767.50. The 14-day Relative Strength Index  indicator sits near 49, indicating neutral momentum. A downside break below the 33,065 level may open a path towards retesting 30,650.\n\nConversely, resistance may be encountered around 35,767; a break above could trigger a move towards the next resistance level at around 36,975.\n\nThe writer is senior investment analyst at Phillip Nova\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWhat's moving the markets?

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG\n\nA month\n\nafter chasing the market with multiple upgrades for European stocks, strategists are back to cutting their targets, spooked by volatility and trade tensions.\n\nAbout a third of the 17 strategists in a monthly Bloomberg survey lowered their year-end targets in April. While the average estimate still sees the Stoxx Europe 600 Index rising to 546 points by end-year, professionals are turning cautious given the twists and turns of US policy.\n\nEuropean stocks have held up relatively well this year, with the continent\u2019s benchmark index up 2 per cent for the year, a sharp contrast with the S&P 500\u2019s 9 per cent drop. Still, effective US duties are the highest in a century, which is likely to negatively impact growth.\n\n\u201cOur tariff modelling suggests most of the impact in Europe is in net exports and not the consumption or other categories,\u201d said UBS Group strategist Gerry Fowler. He sees the Stoxx 600 ending the year at 550 points, down from 580 a month ago, a forecast which assumes \u201csome moderation in China tariffs\u201d.\n\nExpectations for resilient earnings are preventing an even deeper cut, Fowler noted. This is helped by fiscal stimulus, which should fuel a cyclical acceleration in 2026-2027, he added.\n\nDespite tariff uncertainty, the European market is indeed benefiting from an expansive fiscal policy, led by Germany, and much lower interest rates than in the US. The European Central Bank is expected to cut its benchmark as much as three times by the end of the year, taking the base rate close to 1.5 per cent and keeping a two-percentage point differential with the Federal Reserve.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\n\u201cTrading conditions could remain choppy amid still-elevated macro/policy uncertainty,\u201d said Citigroup strategists led by Beata Manthey. \u201cHowever, should trade negotiations continue successfully, we still see scope for 5-10 per cent upside for European equities by year-end.\u201d\n\nBarclays strategists led by Emmanuel Cau made the deepest cut, slashing their Stoxx 600 target to 490 from 580 a month ago. Yet, they insisted that the range of outcome is wide, with potential to fall to 390 in the event of a prolonged recession, or rebound towards 530 if the trade war de-escalates quickly.\n\nOn a relative basis, they added that Europe is in a better position given supportive monetary and fiscal policy. \u201cBig picture, the end of US exceptionalism could well be Europe\u2019s chance,\u201d they said.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nWhy investors can\u2019t get enough of gold right now\n\nWith the recent volatility spike, caution has returned and market bears are seeing the current narrative likely to prove them right. TFS Derivatives strategist Stephane Ekolo, who already had the survey\u2019s lowest target, cut his view even further. He sees a 9 per cent downside this year, with the Stoxx 600 falling to 470.\n\n\u201cInvestors still fail to appreciate the economic growth slowdown and weakening corporate environment ahead,\u201d Ekolo said. \u201cDeteriorating PMI, weak earnings, negative EPS (earnings per share) revisions are likely to take their toll on the market, adding downside risks.\u201d\n\nInvestors are still bullish but the excitement about Europe is cooling, according to the latest fund manager survey by Bank of America. A net 19 per cent of respondents expect near-term gains for European equities, down from 30 per cent last month, while a net 56 per cent project upside in the next 12 months, down from 67 per cent.\n\nOverall, a net 22 per cent say they are overweight European equities, down from 39 per cent last month. By contrast, a net 36 per cent say that they are underweight US equities, the highest in almost two years.\n\n\u201cIn the short term, volatility may persist and corporate guidance could remain unclear,\u201d said Societe Generale strategist Roland Kaloyan, who sees little upside from current levels. \u201cTrade negotiations are still underway, central banks retain policy firepower and markets have yet to price in the anticipated tax cuts in the US, as well as potential supportive measures from countries with fiscal room to mitigate the impact of the tariffs.\u201d\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/6b2be885f49a6950832f2216a5dbdbf83138c74a1b15a807bce51a283a2f9c40?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "The rush to gold has pushed the spot price to a series of record highs, topping US$3,500 in mid-April and extending a ferocious run from last year."}]}

PHOTO: BT FILE\n\n[SINGAPORE] Financial institutions should incorporate nature into their financing strategies, as investing in the protection and restoration of nature will bring about significant economic opportunities.\n\nThis view was published in a recent white paper by the Singapore Sustainable Finance Association, a sustainable finance industry group supported by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.\n\nEconomic opportunities can be found in areas such as the circular economy, the protection of water and marine resources, as well as waste and pollution prevention \u2013 but financial institutions need to expand their definitions of nature financing to include corporate activities that either reduce their negative impacts on nature, or create positive ones.\n\nCiting statistics from the World Economic Forum, the paper noted that nature transition, which refers to plans to reverse negative impacts and restore nature, could unlock US$10 trillion in global business opportunities. It could also create 395 million jobs by 2030.\n\nAnd out of these figures, US$4.3 trillion and 232 million jobs could go to Asia.\n\nThe paper\u2019s call to finance nature also arises from the serious risk that a loss of natural capital will pose to the economy as company revenues come under threat, or if they have to incur additional costs from new regulations or increased consumer scrutiny. By extension, the portfolios of financial institutions will be exposed to such risks as well.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nFriday, 12.30 pm\n\nESG Insights\n\nAn exclusive weekly report on the latest environmental, social and governance issues.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThe paper said: \u201cRisks to the real economy equate to risks in financing portfolios, while investment needed for transition represents an opportunity for the financing sector. The scale of both problem and opportunity make nature transition a material issue for the financial sector.\u201d\n\nHow can banks start?\n\nFinancial institutions can approach nature financing in a way similar to what they have done for climate financing, given their close relationship, the paper indicated.\n\nThey can first start by establishing a governance structure for nature financing, and assess the materiality of nature within their portfolios.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nWhy sustainable equity investors should pay attention to Singapore\n\nAbout 20% of UOB\u2019s lending portfolio exposed to nature-related risks\n\nMelting glaciers: the tip of the iceberg in the global water crisis\n\nDBS\u2019 update to transition finance framework has strategic value for the bank\n\nPolitical inertia will end when climate-change impact is \u2018too big to ignore\u2019: Ravi Menon\n\nMore\n\nFinancial institutions can then channel financing towards activities that support nature or engage clients, to identify nature-related risks and opportunities, as well as integrate nature considerations into their operations and business models.\n\n\u201cFor financial institutions, the climate-nature nexus has important practical implications. Financial institutions that have incorporated climate transition across their operations will have the necessary infrastructure in place to do the same for nature,\u201d said the report.\n\nThe paper detailed a broad sector-level materiality assessment, which identified the following sectors in South-east Asia which are most dependent on nature: agriculture, forestry and fishing, mining and quarrying, accommodation and food service activities, manufacturing, and built environment.\n\nAgriculture, forestry and fishing, as well as mining and quarrying, were found to have the most impact on nature.\n\nChallenges in nature financing\n\nHowever, the white paper recognised that the financial sector alone cannot achieve the transition needed for nature, given the scale of investments required.\n\nDrawing from the experience of climate financing, the paper noted that the challenges of nature degradation require coordinated effort by the government, regulatory bodies, companies in the real economy, as well as the financial sector.\n\nOn this front, it noted that international talks on nature are shaping up to be similar to international climate talks; the landmark Global Biodiversity Framework was agreed to at an annual United Nations-led meeting on biological diversity in 2022, known as COP15.\n\nWith global targets to protect at least 30 per cent of the world\u2019s land, coastal and marine areas by 2030, this framework set in motion a process by which countries can formulate policies for nature, as their governments form national biodiversity strategies and action plans.\n\nThe Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures has also created reporting standards for financial institutions and companies that are directly comparable with climate reporting.\n\nHowever, the paper noted that there is a need for further action by all stakeholders.\n\nGovernments can establish environmental, fiscal and industrial policies that protect and ensure the provision of ecosystem services. Policy direction will then determine which economic activities are bankable.\n\nFinancial regulators can consider how existing regulation and guidance on reporting, risk management, governance and planning may be improved to increase the focus on nature.\n\nSectoral pathways developed by scientific teams and industry groups for target-setting on nature is underway. More work is needed to ensure widespread adoption, including the definition of appropriate metrics, and will require joint consultation among the government, corporate and financial sectors.\n\nThe white paper noted that the financial sector can engage relevant industry groups in material real-economy sectors, to understand their nature considerations, challenges and financing requirements.\n\n\u201cThis would raise awareness of nature risks and opportunities, and potentially encourage real economy sectors to think more about nature in their business operations,\u201d it said.\n\nGiven that nature is location-specific and can be measured using different dimensions, the paper also said that standardising and simplifying the most relevant nature metrics at industry level would be crucial in measuring progress and accelerating the target-setting process.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It\u2019s good for the minority communities, it is good for the majority community, too.\u201d\n\nSM Lee also talked about Tang Liang Hong, a 1997 General Election candidate \u201cwho stirred Chinese chauvinism sentiments\u201d before the government\u00a0took a decisive stance and fought hard against him.\n\nTang\u00a0contested in Cheng San GRC with the WP in 1997, losing to his PAP opponents, after garnering 45.18 per cent of the vote. During the hustings, the PAP accused Tang\u00a0of being\u00a0an anti-Christian Chinese chauvinist and later filed multiple defamation lawsuits against him.\n\nTang\u00a0eventually left the country and was found liable for defamation by the courts.\n\nIn his Malay speech, SM Lee said he had served as prime minister for two decades, and in that time, he appreciated working closely with the Malay/Muslim community to achieve its aspirations. This has continued under the leadership of Wong, he said.\n\nSingapore, he added, must remain a nation where all communities practise give-and-take and mutual accommodation, instead of each one pushing and fighting for its own interests over national interests or at the expense of others.\n\nThis is how Singapore and its multiracial policies have enabled all communities to progress together all these years.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am especially grateful that the Malay/Muslim community has supported this multiracial approach and the government\u2019s multiracial policies.\n\n\u201cThis has allowed the Malay/Muslim community to make progress and achieve success \u2013 not just in the secular aspects like education, jobs, and income, but also in terms of the space that you have to practice your faith.\u201d\n\nTHE STRAITS TIMES\n\nFor more election coverage, visit our\n\nGE2025 microsite\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Singapore\n\nSingapore boosts support for Timor-Leste as it prepares to join Asean\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:36 PM\n\nEconomists upgrade 2025 outlook after\u00a0\nQ2 GDP turns out better than expected\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:02 PM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nDaily Debrief: What Happened Today (Jul 14)\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:30 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nSingapore GDP up 4.3% in Q2, well above market expectations amid US tariff pause\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:00 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/a5158e3e4c327574e2ca1d3db20156e5b14496d60907f2148e2ab1c9178720ab?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "PAP Ang Mo Kio GRC candidate Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong speaking at the PAP rally for Ang Mo Kio GRC, Jalan Kayu, Kebun Bahru and Yio Chu Kang SMCs held at Fern Green Primary School on April 27, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/e5f2cde5bd8e7bc54a749be3e9a836d9d6b2761c3eccfddb4d4e0c9026eec01c?w=180&h=120&dpr=1&f=webp", "alt_text": "The WP does not push any individual\u2019s agenda in exchange for support, Workers' Party chief Pritam Singh said, reiterating the party's stance in an earlier statement that morning."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/164af9f4be9139100c31933e1c198265e537adf6447012b1f6b859d30024f348?w=180&h=120&dpr=1&f=webp", "alt_text": "Chan, who was NTUC secretary-general from 2015 to 2018, also responded to comments made by Workers\u2019 Party chief Pritam Singh last night on the labour movement and PAP MPs."}]}

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG\n\n[FRANKFURT] European Central Bank (ECB) officials are preparing to lower interest rates further, expecting lasting damage to the economy from US tariffs even if Donald Trump\u2019s administration softens its stance in the weeks ahead.\n\nFollowing intense meetings at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last week, most policymakers are leaving Washington disillusioned. They anticipate Trump\u2019s unpredictable behaviour will continue to feed uncertainty, damping spending and investment \u2013 and ultimately inflation for some time to come.\n\nThe euro\u2019s appreciation, tighter financing conditions due to increased fiscal expenditures and a drop in energy prices are also set to weigh on prices, strengthening the case for an eighth quarter-point rate cut in June. What happens thereafter will largely depend on updated inflation forecasts for next year and beyond.\n\nEconomists from Bank of America, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley already see the deposit rate \u2013 currently at 2.25 per cent \u2013 falling to at least 1.5 per cent this year to stimulate demand.\n\nWhile Governing Council members including Olli Rehn and Gediminas Simkus have signalled that they are open to considering taking borrowing costs towards such levels, others such as Klaas Knot and Martins Kazaks are cautioning against too much activism, arguing that the medium-term impact of recent events remains unclear.\n\nPresident Christine Lagarde largely stuck to the ECB\u2019s official line.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\n\u201cWhen the size and distribution of shocks are highly uncertain, we cannot provide certainty by committing to a particular rate path,\u201d she told finance ministers and fellow central bankers on Friday (Apr 25). Earlier in the week, she said the ECB must be \u201cdata dependent in the extreme\u201d.\n\nMost of the latest reports are suggesting weaker growth momentum ahead. A survey of purchasing managers revealed depressed confidence and sluggish demand, and IMF projections downgraded expansion in the 20-nation economy to just 0.8 per cent this year from 1 per cent before.\n\nSofter growth comes with lower inflation. The IMF, much like the ECB, predicts price pressures will hit 2 per cent sometime in the second half of the year. But compared to what transpired from some policymakers visiting Washington from Europe, its message is a more hawkish one.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nECB to cut rates again to help economy overcome trade turmoil\n\nECB pushes back against calls for looser bank rules\n\nBlackRock shifts to US junk bonds with ECB set to slow rate cuts\n\nReaching the 2 per cent target \u201ccan be achieved with another 25 basis-point cut\u201d, Alfred Kammer, the director of the IMF\u2019s European department told reporters on Friday. \u201cWe don\u2019t see a need for going lower than 2 per cent\u201d in the absence of \u201cmajor shocks\u201d.\n\nThat threshold is perceived by economists to be the closest estimate of neutral, neither accommodating nor restricting demand. It could turn into a crucial mark that policymakers, especially the more hawkish ones, may be reluctant to cross.\n\n\u201cIf inflation were to undershoot the target significantly and for an extended period of time, the natural choice would be to lower interest rates into stimulus territory,\u201d Kazaks, who heads Latvia\u2019s central bank, said in a Saturday interview. \u201cCurrently it is not the case.\u201d\n\nKnot, his Dutch colleague, argued in a speech on Wednesday that neutral \u201cbroadly remains the place to be\u201d. While inflation may slow more rapidly than previously anticipated, he argued that the longer-term fallout from trade disruptions and higher European spending on defence and infrastructure is \u201cfar less clear\u201d.\n\nHis comments suggest that the ECB on Jun 5 \u2013 the last meeting he attends before the end of his term \u2013 will be forced to lower next year\u2019s outlook for consumer-price growth from the 1.9 per cent projected in March. But it\u2019s the 2027 reading that will matter to assess whether prices are stable further down the line.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, some of his colleagues are nearly ready to declare victory.\n\nFrance\u2019s Francois Villeroy de Galhau argued that \u201cthere is currently no inflationary risk in Europe\u201d. His colleague Peter Kazimir from Slovakia concurred that inflation will be approaching its target in the coming months \u2013 instead of early 2026 as foreseen just last month.\n\nIncoming data\n\nIn April, the rate probably dropped to 2.1 per cent, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey before data on Friday. Two days earlier, Eurostat will publish a first estimate for the economy\u2019s first-quarter performance, with analysts predicting 0.2 per cent growth.\n\nThese data will feed into the ECB\u2019s next decision along with fresh forecasts. But while policymakers are eagerly awaiting the glimpse into the future they regularly provide, they are unlikely to capture the entire new equilibrium on trade. Trump\u2019s 90-day respite for negotiations will not be over before early July, and even then, it\u2019s unclear if a lasting agreement can be reached.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that we maintain full freedom of action, implying that we don\u2019t define certain thresholds because of an assumed neutral rate, and we don\u2019t a priori rule out a certain size of rate cut either,\u201d Rehn, the head of Finland\u2019s central bank, said. \u201cThis is a time for agile and active monetary policy.\u201d\n\nAsked about the option of a bigger move, chief economist Philip Lane said that \u201cthere\u2019s no reason to say we are always going to do the default 25\u201d basis-point steps, though he stressed it was a theoretical argument. Others said they did not see a need for such a step outside of exceptional circumstances.\n\nMeantime, Estonia\u2019s Madis Muller said there\u2019s a possibility policy might have to be \u201ca bit more accommodative\u201d if trade uncertainty proves more damaging for growth.\n\nBut pessimism on the economy did not dominate sentiment for everyone.\n\nFunds are flowing into the eurozone and bond yields have come down, said Boris Vujcic, the chief of Croatia\u2019s central bank. \u201cThe current situation is not the worst scenario for Europe.\u201d BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in International\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:54 PM\n\nSuspended Thailand PM Paetongtarn hit by ethics investigation, source and media say\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:07 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/9f06e7582f73f455bfe7a243641d3d6c9f3ccbc895819d43df157106f209c2b7?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "The Euro Sculpture at Willi-Brandt-Platz in the financial district of Frankfurt, Germany, on Thursday, March 6, 2025.

But we will learn the right lessons and we will do better.\u201d\n\nThe labour movement thought the deal was reasonable, said Ng, the People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) candidate for Jalan Kayu SMC, in a rally speech.\n\nThe NTUC secretary-general noted that Income\u2019s market share had dropped from 20 per cent to 6 per cent over the last 10 years.\n\n\u201cThere was a real threat to the sustainability of Income, especially in moments of crisis. The proposed deal would strengthen Income and, most importantly, protect the interests of Income\u2019s policyholders,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, as details of the proposed Allianz deal surfaced, Ng said that the\n\ngovernment \u201csaw it differently\u201d\n\nand stopped it by changing the law.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\n\u201c(At) NTUC, we could not have known that the law would be changed, but we sincerely respected the government\u2019s view and accepted it, (and) humbly acknowledge the public feedback we\u2019ve received,\u201d he said.\n\nA review of NTUC Enterprise has been initiated so that the labour movement can learn the right lessons and do better for Singaporeans, he added.\n\nIn his rally speech, Ng also responded to comments made on Saturday by Workers\u2019 Party (WP) chief Pritam Singh that were directly aimed at him.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nGE2025: WP candidates represent all Singaporeans, not just their communities: Pritam Singh\n\nGE2025: PAP\u2019s Ng Chee Meng to face WP\u2019s Andre Low in Jalan Kayu SMC\n\nNg said: \u201cUnlike (what) somebody last night said (about) NTUC (being) a safety net, a trampoline, a catchment when we lose the elections, it is simply not true. I am elected as the secretary-general of NTUC every four years, and I count on the mandate of workers and unionists electing me into the central committee.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIn Parliament, as an MP, I can speak up for workers. I can speak up for residents of Jalan Kayu SMC when national interests are debated and major decisions are made, both for the workers and all the residents of Jalan Kayu.\u201d\n\nAt the same rally, Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong also gave his full support to Ng, saying that he\u00a0has continued to contribute by serving as labour chief and working closely with the government to support workers through the pandemic. This was after he lost the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cHe proved himself reliable, trustworthy, committed. Therefore, for this election, I recommended (him) to (Prime Minister Lawrence Wong). And the PM agreed and invited Chee Meng to stand again,\u201d said SM Lee.\n\nWeighing in on the Allianz-Income deal, SM Lee said that while the Labour MPs did not ask questions, six PAP MPs asked questions and only one WP MP did.\n\nHe noted that after the proposed deal was discussed further, the government realised it had to change its mind.\n\n\u201cWe have to say we oppose this deal. We will block it but we have to change legislation so that we can block it. NTUC cannot do that, the government has to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it shows we are brothers, with that symbiotic relationship. You make that decision, I look at it impartially, objectively, afresh. There is no groupthink.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Ng\u2019s opponent in the general election, first-time WP candidate Andre Low, was asked by reporters for his views on the Allianz-Income deal.\n\nSaid Low: \u201cIt is just one of many missteps our previous administration has had over the past parliamentary term... But all I would say is, there (are) still many unanswered questions, and I think Singaporeans at large, not just Jalan Kayu residents, deserve some answers.\n\n\u201d\n\nLow added that while he has received a warm welcome from the constituency\u2019s residents, he still regards himself as the underdog.\n\nHe said: \u201cI represent a very different kind of candidate from my PAP opponent. We are over 20 years of age apart. (Ng) is a scholar and a general. He\u2019s reached the very top of the military career pathway.

But this could result in MNCs leaving Singapore, taking with them the jobs they provide, he said.\n\nTong also noted that taking more from the reserves would not be a bad idea from a politician\u2019s perspective, because the Government would not have had to explain the need to raise the GST.\n\n\u201cBut from the perspective of safeguarding Singapore\u2019s long-term interests for our children and their children... would that be prudent? Would that be safe? Would that be wise?\u201d he asked.\n\nDoing so would mean the reserves would grow at a slower rate, leaving less resources for subsequent generations, he said.\n\n\u201cWe must always test policy ideas against practical execution and the impact that it will make on other people\u2019s lives, including future generations of Singaporeans,\u201d said Tong.\n\nThe minister invited voters to scrutinise the PAP\u2019s commitments to the nation in its manifesto, as well as those set out for East Coast GRC by his team.\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t just look at our plans before you vote. Look at the Workers\u2019 Party\u2019s plans,\u201d he said. \u201cDo they help a subsequent generation of Singaporeans, and do they stand by those plans?\u201d\n\nTong also spoke of the need for steady hands, given the uncertain global economic situation.\n\nWith turbulence ahead, there must be something steady, strong and proven that people can hold to \u2013 and that something is the PAP, he said.\n\nHe noted that some people have said the PAP is drawing attention to these circumstances, hoping to win votes by scare tactics and fearmongering.\n\n\u201cBut it is not up to us. And I think we can all see what is happening around us,\u201d said Tong.\n\nHe acknowledged that Singapore has not been spared the effects of global inflation and economic uncertainty, and said the Government will provide for those who need more help.\n\nThis would not just be short-term measures like rebates and vouchers \u2013 though they are important and help a lot \u2013 but also long-term measures like strengthening the economy and building a more resilient workforce, said Tong.\n\nThe other four East Coast GRC candidates \u2013 Tan Kiat How, Jessica Tan, Dinesh Vasu Dash and  Hazlina Abdul Halim \u2013 also took turns to speak at the rally.\n\nIn her speech, Tan said good policies mean nothing if people cannot access them. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m committed to continue creating platforms that promote clarity, dialogue and understanding of our policies,\u201d she added.\n\nWhile Singapore\u2019s policies are thoughtfully designed, no system is perfect, she said.\n\n\u201cI have and I will continue to champion causes to close gaps in our policies,\u201d Jessica Tan said, adding that this includes speaking up on the sandwiched generation and senior employability.\n\nTan Kiat How asked residents to remember that when the PAP promises something, it gets it done.\n\nHe compared the party to a sturdy tree, saying: \u201cI urge you not to cut down this tree in exchange (for) sweet promises made to you about good profits from cutting down the tree to sell it as timber.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery time (an) election comes around, there may be sweet promises that may look good, sound good in the short term, but in the long term, you are destroying the roots of a sturdy tree.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Dinesh laid out his immediate priorities for East Coast residents \u2013 in particular Bedok, the division he will take over from\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, who is retiring\n\n, if elected. He wants to support seniors and caregivers, help young families, and uplift minority communities and the vulnerable.\n\nDinesh, a new face, also hit out at opposition politicians, whom he criticised for a lack of action.\n\n\u201cThere is talk of an opposition wipeout, but there has been opposition in our Parliament for the last 44 years. What have they been doing?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSingaporeans are tired of their talking. We want action. Yes, the PAP is not perfect, but we have protected every Singaporean and every Singaporean family for the last 60 years, and we get things done.\u201d\n\nHazlina, also a new face, said her time in the social impact space has given her the courage to brave challenging situations. She said she plans to bring the people and public and private sectors closer together.\n\n\u201cThis is a time for us to build trust. Our young are worried about their place in this world.

S-Reits with international exposure, as well as those holding hospitality assets, ranked among the top performers.\n\nOver the past two weeks, the top 10 performers in the iEdge S-Reit index mostly saw net institutional inflows, with these counters receiving a combined S$23.3 million in net institutional inflows from Apr 14 to 24.\n\nHowever, institutional and retail investors were net sellers of the broader S-Reits sector over the same period. From Apr 14 to 24, institutional investors net sold S$36.6 million in S-Reits, bringing their total net outflows for the sector to S$465.1 million for the year-to-date.\n\nMeanwhile, retail investors net sold S$64.4 million over the same period, reversing net buying activity earlier this month.\u00a0For the year-to-date, retail investors remain net buyers of the S-Reits sector, with total net inflows of S$261.9 million.\n\nCapitaLand China Trust (CLCT) ranked among the top three iEdge S-Reit index constituents over the past two weeks, with its units rising over 11 per cent from Apr 14 to 24.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nTuesday, 12 pm\n\nProperty Insights\n\nGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nCLCT\u2019s first-quarter business update on Apr 24 showed that it maintained high occupancy for its retail portfolio of 97.7 per cent, with positive rental reversions of 0.5 per cent.\n\nThe Reit\u2019s business parks also had stable occupancy of 83.7 per cent, while logistics parks saw 95.7 per cent occupancy.\n\nThe CEO of CLCT\u2019s manager noted in a recent SGX kopi-C interview that CLCT\u2019s malls mainly serve China\u2019s middle-income consumers, and the tenants have little dependence on US-imported products. He added that although US tariffs have introduced volatility to capital markets, the direct impact on CLCT\u2019s operations remains minimal.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nS-Reits record net institutional inflows in March as sector snaps 5-month losing streak\n\nElsewhere, Mapletree Logistics Trust\u2019s (MLT) full-year results, released on Apr 23, showed stable operating performance with 96.2 per cent occupancy as at end-March, and positive rental reversion of 5.1 per cent for Q4.\n\nThe Reit recorded positive rental reversions in all markets except China. MLT\u2019s manager noted that the diversified portfolio mitigated headwinds from higher borrowing costs and China weakness.\n\nMLT\u2019s manager added that the changing trade policy landscape is unprecedented and evolving, and tenants are expected to take a cautious approach to leasing and expansion in the short term. However, the majority of MLT\u2019s tenants are serving local domestic consumption, accounting for around 85 per cent of portfolio revenue as at its Q4.\n\nMLT\u2019s units rebounded 7.4 per cent from Apr 14 to 24, ranking it among the top 10 index performers.\n\nSimilarly, Suntec Reit units also gained 7.4 per cent over the same period.\n\nThe Reit, which also announced its Q1 business update on Apr 24, reported improved distributable income (DI) for the period ended March, rising 4.3 per cent on year to S$45.9 million.\u00a0 Distribution per unit was also 3.4 per cent higher year on year for Q1.\n\nThe manager noted that DI was improved due to lower financing costs as well as better operating performance, with all properties \u2013 except for 55 Currie Street, Adelaide \u2013 registering stronger operating performance.\n\nSome 13 S-Reits have already released their financial results or business updates for the financial period ended March. Another 12 S-Reits are expected to release their latest filings this week, including STI constituents CapitaLand Ascendas Reit, Mapletree Industrial Trust, and Frasers Centrepoint Trust.

His actions had contributed to the radicalisation of at least two other Singaporeans.\n\nThe authorities noted how Zulfikar had also called on Muslims to reject the constitutional, secular, democratic state in favour of an Islamic state governed by syariah law.\n\nHe also believed that violence should be used to achieve this goal if necessary.\n\nIn the case of Sukri, the authorities said that he had reposted Zulfikar\u2019s post.\n\nAs for Iskandar, the authorities said that he had expressed support for a candidate in GE2025.\n\nST checks also found that Iskandar has been posting about Singapore politics. On April 24, he uploaded a post saying that he would be sad if a candidate did not win the election.\n\nHe said in the post: \u201cSad if Faisal lose after all the good work since 2011. Raised many issues especially the tudung issue and have the courage to explain to Parliament that in Islam religion must not be separated from politics. Hope he will be successful once again though tough.\u201d\n\nHe had also shared several other posts still online showing support for WP members such as its vice-chair Faisal Manap, election candidates Alia Mattar, Sufyan Mikhail Putra and Abdul Muhaimin, as well as Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) candidate Damanhuri Abas and Singapore Democratic Alliance candidate Abu Mohamed.\n\nThe posts subjected to the order have been targeted at Singaporeans and they interfere with Singapore\u2019s domestic politics, which are reserved for its citizens, said the authorities.\n\n\u201cThey also urge Singaporeans to vote on racial and religious lines, and have led to more social media postings of a similar nature.\u201d\n\nThe two agencies also warned that the posts have the potential to fracture the multiracial and multi-religious harmony that is the bedrock of Singapore.\n\nThe agencies also underscored that Singapore is a secular state, and that all public institutions are designed to serve Singaporeans equally, regardless of race or religion.\n\n\u201cWe must not mix religion and politics. Singapore is a secular state. Our institutions serve all Singaporeans equally. Bringing religion into politics will undermine social cohesion and harmony, as we have seen in other countries with race- or religion-based politics,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAt the same time, the Government acknowledged that public policy may sometimes involve matters of religious concern.\n\nIt stressed that it would continue to engage a broad range of stakeholders, including religious groups, to ensure their views are heard and considered in policymaking.\n\n\u201cWe urge all political parties and their candidates, as well as religious organisations, leaders and members of the public to do our part to safeguard the precious harmony we have in Singapore today,\u201d the authorities said.\n\nTHE STRAITS TIMES\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The average price for the top 100 products in the beauty and health category increased by 51 per cent from Thursday, with several of the items more than doubling in price. For home and kitchen products and toys, the average jump was more than 30 per cent, led by a massive 377 per cent increase in the price of a 10-piece set of kitchen towels. For women\u2019s clothing, the rise was 8 per cent.\n\nE-commerce shopping platforms such as Shein and Temu face a 120 per cent tariff on many of their products due to the US government\u2019s decision to end the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption for small packages from mainland China and Hong Kong. Exporters in recent years had capitalised on the exemption, which allowed goods valued at under US$800 to enter the US without tariffs or customs duties. Washington will also increase the per-postal-item fee on goods entering after May 2 to US$100 and even higher after Jun 1.\n\nAs recently as Apr 21, Trump said in a social media post that \u201cthere is virtually no inflation\u201d because of falling energy and grocery prices. But Shein\u2019s price hike reflects the latest efforts by Chinese online retailers to pass at least some of the extra imports costs onto US consumers.\n\nBack in February, in order to seek cover from Trump\u2019s tariff policy, Shein offered incentives to some of its Chinese suppliers to set up production capacity in Vietnam. Temu wanted Chinese factories to ship their own wares in bulk directly to American warehouses, adopting what it called a \u201chalf-custody\u201d framework.\n\nTemu and Shein saw sales rebound in March and early April as American shoppers stockpiled everything from makeup brushes to home appliances before tariff-led price increases set in, Bloomberg data shows. Both companies announced earlier this month that they would raise prices in the US.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nUS not ready to lower tariff on imports from Singapore, but agrees to explore way forward: DPM Gan\n\nIn general, prices rose by about 10 per cent for Shein in the US from Apr 24 to 26 based on a sample shopping cart filled by Bloomberg News with 50 items from a range of categories. During the period, seven out of 50 sampled items were delisted in the US. In contrast, Shein\u2019s prices in the UK stayed mostly unchanged and no items were delisted.\n\nOf the 43 items still available in the US cart, 30 had a price hike of more than 10 per cent in the two days.\n\nWhile broader price adjustments came on Friday, some goods had already become more expensive. The prices for dozens of top products in the Women\u2019s Clothing category on Shein increased on Apr 22, pushing the average price for the top 100 products in the category to US$9.06, from US$8.68, an increase of more than 4 per cent.

I ask all voters and Singaporeans (to) keep them focused on their NTUC jobs.\u201d\n\nThe labour movement is a \u201cguaranteed trampoline\u201d for losing PAP candidates, said Singh, adding that Ng and (assistant secretary-general) Choo could still lobby the government by virtue of NTUC\u2019s symbiotic relationship with the PAP.\n\nOn Sunday, Chan said that every NTUC secretary-general and various labour MPs must go through the NTUC\u2019s internal election. It is not a given that they will be selected or elected into the central committee.\n\nHe said: \u201cWho NTUC elects and how strong the support NTUC gives to its secretary-general is not just an internal issue within NTUC. It also determines how effective the secretary-general and the labour MPs can represent them beyond NTUC, and this is very critical.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe stronger the support for NTUC labour MPs and secretary-general, the greater their mandate and confidence to speak on behalf of workers beyond NTUC.\u201d\n\nFor more election coverage, visit our\n\nGE2025 microsite\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Singapore\n\nSingapore boosts support for Timor-Leste as it prepares to join Asean\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:36 PM\n\nEconomists upgrade 2025 outlook after\u00a0\nQ2 GDP turns out better than expected\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:02 PM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nDaily Debrief: What Happened Today (Jul 14)\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:30 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nSingapore GDP up 4.3% in Q2, well above market expectations amid US tariff pause\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:00 AM", "images": [{"image_url": null, "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/e5f2cde5bd8e7bc54a749be3e9a836d9d6b2761c3eccfddb4d4e0c9026eec01c?w=180&h=120&dpr=1&f=webp", "alt_text": "The WP does not push any individual\u2019s agenda in exchange for support, Workers' Party chief Pritam Singh said, reiterating the party's stance in an earlier statement that morning."}]}

Singapore achieved an average of 28 per cent, slightly better than the regional average of 25 per cent.\n\nHowever, the report noted some areas where Singapore-based investors outperformed their peers on three metrics.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nFriday, 12.30 pm\n\nESG Insights\n\nAn exclusive weekly report on the latest environmental, social and governance issues.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThese are:\n\nRecognition of climate risks and opportunities: this is becoming a mainstream practice in Singapore, with 89 per cent of investors having done so compared with a regional average of 75 per cent.\n\nConducting advanced climate scenario analysis: Singapore-based investors scored 72 per cent, much higher than the average score of 44 per cent across Asia.\n\nSetting policies on fossil fuels or other high-emitting sectors: 61 per cent of investors here have policies which indirectly or directly support the transition to renewable energy and the electrification of industries, compared to an Asia-wide average of 43 per cent.\n\nThe data on Singapore investors was extracted from an assessment across Asia of how investors have progressed in integrating climate-related considerations in their investment processes.\n\nOut of the 230 investors reviewed \u2013 comprising 113 asset owners and 117 asset managers \u2013 the median assets under management was approximately US$100 billion.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nIssue 145: South-east Asia\u2019s sunburn; favourable market greets Singapore green bond auction\n\nWhy sustainable equity investors should pay attention to Singapore\n\nGreen investors are finding bargains in Trump\u2019s Big Oil era\n\nGlobal investors to raise allocations to private markets, remain committed to clean energy: survey\n\nMore\n\nThey had reviewed these investors on five focus areas: climate governance, climate investment, climate corporate engagement, climate advocacy policy as well as climate disclosures.\n\nThe review found that across Asia, institutional investors have been making progress, with more advanced and detailed climate implementation across portfolios.\n\n\u201cHowever, the real economy still has a long way to go until investors align their portfolios with net-zero trajectories.

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\n[GERMANY] Elon Musk\u2019s XAI Holdings is in talks with investors to raise roughly US$20 billion in funding for his newly combined artificial intelligence (AI) startup and social media business, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nIf completed, the prospective deal would be the second-largest startup funding round of all time, according to data provider PitchBook, trailing only OpenAI\u2019s US$40 billion financing earlier this year. The transaction would value the company at more than US$120 billion, said one of the people, all of whom asked not to be identified because the information is private.\n\nXAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nAnnounced in March, XAI Holdings was created from the combination of X, formerly Twitter, and Musk\u2019s AI venture, xAI. The new funding could be used to pay down some of the debt that Musk took on when he converted Twitter into a private company, later renaming it X, one person said.\n\nThat debt has been weighing on X, Bloomberg previously reported. In March alone, X paid about US$200 million in debt-servicing costs related to its buyout, according to people briefed on the matter. The firm\u2019s annual interest expense by the end of 2024 was more than US$1.3 billion.\n\nSince the merger, Musk and associates have been sounding out investors on their appetite to put more money into the combined entity, some of the people said. The talks for a prospective round are in the early stages, and the company aims to raise the funds over the next few months.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nMusk drives Tesla calmly through investors\u2019 red lights\n\nSingapore Airlines, OpenAI link up to build AI solutions\u00a0to raise efficiency, customer service\n\nThe amount in the round could rise higher than US$20 billion, one of the people said. The total has not yet been decided, and terms could change, the people said.\n\nThe size of the new funding round underscores both investors\u2019 enthusiasm for AI companies, but also Musk\u2019s standing as a business titan and political power player. Musk, a key ally of President Donald Trump, is expected to soon leave Washington, but has made sweeping changes in government since Trump\u2019s election and installed key allies in powerful positions there.\n\nWhile the fortunes of Tesla \u2013 Musk\u2019s publicly traded business \u2013 have faltered, the valuations at his private firms have continued to climb. For example, Musk\u2019s rocket company, SpaceX, became the most valuable startup in history after a private transaction last year valued the business at US$350 billion.\u00a0BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Companies & Markets\n\nZuckerberg says Meta will invest hundreds of billions in superintelligence\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:48 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLinkedIn settles antitrust lawsuit, agrees to contracting changes\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:12 PM\n\nUS: Wall Street opens mixed as investors digest fresh tariff threats\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:43 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nBRC Asia secures contracts for Changi Airport Terminal 5 project worth S$570 million\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:04 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/bc9c45d846c3d565590f9d7c682ea9a6b5909c02844c97c44c366291225bca19?w=180&h=120&dpr=1&f=webp", "alt_text": "At US$750 billion, Tesla\u2019s value is propped up not by car sales but by faith that Musk can work magic, and has the time to do so."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/88fd043d9837a353d6a7fd3721b2c185ddf90ed919a7744cc17eeac52e5e4d25?w=180&h=120&dpr=1&f=webp", "alt_text": "The AI startup's maiden partnership with a major carrier that it co-develops solutions with and for follows its announcement last October of plans to open a Singapore office as its regional hub."}]}

You know, let us go in and work China,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would be great. That would be a big win, but I\u2019m not even sure I\u2019m going to ask for it because they don\u2019t want it open.\u201d\n\nThe back-and-forth added to the substantial uncertainty surrounding the state of play over Trump\u2019s erratic tariff policy, not just around China, but also as it pertains to the dozens of countries scrambling to strike their own deals to ease the burden of the hefty import taxes he has unleashed since returning to the White House in January.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nHis team of negotiators was conducting what amounted to a lightning round of trade talks with foreign officials who had swarmed Washington this week for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank Group.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, reported that the US Trade Representative (USTR) aims to streamline the process by laying out broad categories for negotiation: tariffs and quotas; non-tariff barriers to trade, such as regulations on US goods; digital trade; rules of origin for products; and economic security and other commercial issues. It also plans to focus on a list of 18 countries that have submitted written proposals.\n\nA USTR official told Reuters it was \u201cworking under an organized and rigorous framework and moving ahead quickly with willing trading partners.\u201d The official said the administration had made US objectives clear to other countries and has a \u201cvery good sense of what they can each individually offer.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nBeijing says claims of ongoing US-China trade talks \u2018groundless\u2019\n\nChina\u2019s central bank chief warns trade frictions threaten trust in world economy\n\nBut while Trump officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, touted indications of swift progress, many of their counterparts were more circumspect, and finance chiefs at the IMF were heading home with renewed urgency to diminish the risks presented by the tariffs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m walking away from these meetings with a clear sense of everything that is at stake and the risks that are there for jobs, for growth, for living standards all over the world,\u201d Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe told Reuters. \u201cThe meetings here ... reminded me of why we need to leave no stone unturned in the next few weeks and months to see how we can reduce that uncertainty.\u201d\n\nDe-escalation\n\nWhile clarity on whether deals are actually being struck to avoid the imposition of even steeper tariffs come early July, there were signs of some de-escalation. China exempted some US imports from its steep tariffs as business groups said Beijing has allowed some US-made pharmaceuticals to enter the country without paying the 125 per cent duties that Beijing imposed earlier this month in response to Trump\u2019s 145 per cent tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\nAlso, a list of 131 product categories said to be under consideration for exemptions was circulating among some businesses and trade groups. Reuters could not verify the list, which includes vaccines, chemicals and jet engines, and China has not yet communicated publicly on the issue.\n\nTrump\u2019s administration has also in recent days signaled it is looking to defuse the tension with China, with Bessent saying both sides see the current state of play as untenable.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump told reporters at the White House that he was very close to a deal with Japan. That is seen by analysts as a \u201ctest case\u201d for other bilateral trade agreements, though talks could be difficult. Some expect Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump to announce a pact when they meet at the G7 summit in Canada in June.\n\nTrump also told Time he had made \u201c200 deals\u201d that would be completed within three to four weeks, though he declined to provide specifics. He said he would consider it a \u201ctotal victory\u201d if tariffs were still 20 to 50 per cent a year from now.\n\nTrump has argued that his thicket of trade barriers will revive US manufacturing industries that have been hollowed out by global competition.\n\nEconomists, however, broadly warn that they would lead to higher prices for US consumers and increase the risk of recession.\n\nUS stocks closed higher on Friday, though they are down roughly 10 per cent since Trump returned to office in January, lagging indexes in other countries, while the dollar has fallen at an unprecedented rate.\n\nTrump\u2019s tariffs dominated discussions at the IMF meetings this week, where finance ministers angled for one-on-one meetings with the US treasury secretary. Bessent characterized initial talks with South Korea as \u201cvery successful\u201d on Thursday, which Seoul called a \u201cgood start.\u201d Further discussions are scheduled for next week. Switzerland also said it was satisfied with its initial meeting with Bessent. The US trade office said it is \u201cconstantly engaged\u201d with Japan and other countries, but said Trump would ultimately decide whether they would proceed. There was little sign of tangible progress with other countries, despite the urging of IMF head Kristalina Georgieva, who warned earlier this week they could cause a severe slowdown in global growth.

First, while they may not be able to control what others say, parties should \u201cclearly and categorically reject\u201d any such endorsements.\n\nSecond, when interacting with people whose positions can undermine national interests, parties should make their stance clear.\n\nIn such interactions, the PAP makes it clear that it does not agree with and cannot support these positions, said PM Wong. \u201cAnd we will state that position clearly with people like that, privately and publicly.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Saturday,\n\nWorkers\u2019 Party chief Pritam Singh said that the party does not push any individual\u2019s agenda\n\nin exchange for support, and that its Malay-Muslim candidates represent all Singaporeans.\n\nSingh was addressing a claim by Malaysia-based Islamic preacher Noor Deros, a Singaporean, who said that WP\u2019s Malay-Muslim candidates had agreed to take up his concerns about the community.\n\nEngagement versus identity politics\n\nThis does not mean that politicians cannot address the needs of different communities, nor talk about race and religion, PM Wong said.\n\nHis own engagements help the government understand the diverse concerns and needs of Singaporeans, he added.

Lee had narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential race.\n\nThe election of a new president is a crucial step in putting the export-driven nation back on track after Yoon\u2019s ouster created a leadership vacuum at a time when US President Donald Trump is escalating trade tensions across the globe.\n\nThe nomination marks a dramatic turn of events for Lee, whose ambitions of leading the nation seemed all but over last year when he received a suspended jail sentence for breaking an electoral law. An appeals court later acquitted him of the allegations.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s economy shrinks in first quarter as trade war hits exports\n\nA former factory worker who later became a lawyer, Lee has a history of bouncing back from challenges that include corruption allegations, a hunger strike and even being stabbed.\n\nHe is set for a race against the nominee from the ruling People Power Party (PPP), which will pick its candidate on May 3. Its top candidates include former Labour Minister Kim Moon-soo and ex-party chair Hong Joon-pyo. Han Dong-hoon, a former justice minister under Yoon, and lawmaker Ahn Cheol-soo are also seeking to represent the conservative PPP.

Bloomberg\n\nPublished Sat, Apr 26, 2025 \u00b7 09:15 AM\n\n[RUSSIA] President Donald Trump said Russia and Ukraine were \u201cvery close\u201d to an accord after his special envoy met with Vladimir Putin in Moscow and he called for high-level talks between the two countries to help bring an end to the war.\n\n\u201cA good day in talks and meetings with Russia and Ukraine. They are very close to a deal, and the two sides should now meet, at very high levels, to \u2018finish it off,\u2019\u201d Trump said in a post to his Truth Social network on Friday (Apr 25).\n\n\u201cMost of the major points are agreed to. Stop the bloodshed, now. We will be wherever is necessary to help facilitate the end to this cruel and senseless war,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments come as Washington intensifies its push for a deal to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, with the American president\u2019s envoy Steve Witkoff holding talks with Putin on Friday.\n\nThe Kremlin published a short video on Telegram of Witkoff greeting the Russian leader Friday before sitting down at a table with him. Putin\u2019s foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov and envoy for economic relations Kirill Dmitriev were also present.\n\nUshakov told reporters in Moscow that the three-hour conversation was \u201cconstructive\u201d and brought the US and Russian positions closer together on multiple issues, including Ukraine. Putin and Witkoff discussed the possibility of resuming direct talks between Russia and Ukraine, he said.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nWitkoff was set to raise with Putin a US demand that Ukraine have the right to have its own army and defense industry as part of any peace agreement, Bloomberg News reported earlier.\n\nTrump, who\u2019s rushing to end the war as he approaches the first 100 days of his presidency, ramped up pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Wednesday to accept an agreement that critics fear will favor Moscow. Witkoff\u2019s meeting with Putin was his fourth as the US works to achieve a ceasefire.\n\nAgreeing to let Kyiv maintain its armed forces, as demanded by Ukraine and its European allies, would mean Putin would have to give up on his demand for the \u201cdemilitarisation\u201d of the country, one of his main stated aims in the war that\u2019s now in its fourth year.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nTrump threatens Russia oil penalties in bid to persuade Putin\n\nOther US proposals for a deal have tilted far more in Moscow\u2019s favor, including Washington\u2019s recognition of Russia\u2019s 2014 occupation of Crimea and freezing the war largely along existing battle lines that would leave Putin in control of swaths of eastern and southern Ukraine, Bloomberg earlier reported. Kyiv would also be required to abandon its goal of joining the NATO defense alliance.\n\nThe international community has resisted recognizing the Crimean peninsula as Russian to avoid legitimizing Putin\u2019s illegal annexation. Zelenskiy has repeatedly said he won\u2019t cede territory to Moscow.\n\nAsked if he would accept a deal in which Crimea and other regions Putin has taken from Ukraine were folded into Russia, Trump said in an interview with Time magazine published on Friday, \u201cCrimea will stay with Russia.\u201d He added that Zelenskiy \u201cunderstands that.\u201d\n\nThe US leader had said on Thursday that he\u2019s putting \u201ca lot of pressure on both\u201d sides in the war. He said he thought Putin \u201cwants to make a deal. We\u2019re going to find out very soon.\u201d Asked what concessions Russia has offered, Trump said, \u201cStopping the war, stopping taking the whole country \u2013 pretty big concession.\u201d\n\nZelenskiy has acknowledged that Ukrainian forces would be unable to regain control over Crimea.\n\n\u201cThis is true what Trump says, that we don\u2019t have enough weapon \u2013 weapons, not people \u2013 to regain control of Crimea by arms,\u201d he told reporters Friday.

PHOTO: TAY CHU YI, BT\n\n[SINGAPORE] When Michael Thng began volunteering with the Workers\u2019 Party (WP) in 2011, he was so wary of being identified that he instinctively avoided cameras, afraid of being seen in a \u201cblue shirt\u201d.\n\nFourteen years later, he wears the shirt proudly as part of WP\u2019s team for one of the most closely watched contests of General Election 2025.\n\nThe 37-year-old is part of\n\nWP\u2019s slate for Tampines GRC\n\n, which faces the People\u2019s Action Party (PAP), National Solidarity Party and People\u2019s Power Party in GE2025\u2019s only four-way contest.\n\nIn the 2000s and early 2010s, when Thng was growing up, the political climate felt different \u2013 with a sense that supporting the opposition could have consequences, he told\n\nThe Business Times\n\nin an interview on Apr 22.\n\n\u201cI think I was very much shaped by (this) memory,\u201d said the chief operating officer and co-founder of tech startup Showdrop.\n\nBut his mindset shifted during the 2011 watershed election when the WP won Aljunied GRC, marking the first time an opposition party took a Group Representation Constituency from the PAP.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nFriday, 8.30 am\n\nAsean Business\n\nBusiness insights centering on South-east Asia's fast-growing economies.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\n\u201cThat was kind of a pinpoint moment,\u201d said Thng, crediting it with paving the way for more WP supporters \u2013 including himself \u2013 to step forward and contribute to the party.\n\nAfter years of volunteering, he took the plunge to run in this election \u201cin no small part\u201d thanks to encouragement from Sengkang GRC MP He Ting Ru, with whom he had worked on grassroots and policy efforts.\n\nShe helped demystify what being a Member of Parliament (MP) entails, turning what once felt like an \u201camorphous concept\u201d into something more tangible, he said.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nGE2025: PAP\u2019s Sengkang candidate Bernadette Giam wants to bring F&B experience to politics\n\nGE2025: \u2018Don\u2019t fly back to the same old answers\u2019 \u2013 Workers\u2019 Party newcomer Kenneth Tiong wants to offer fresh ideas\n\nGE2025: Tampines GRC to see first four-cornered fight since 1992\n\nGE2025: Workers\u2019 Party\u2019s manifesto offers 125 ideas, from redundancy insurance to prioritising local talent\n\nGE2025: Workers\u2019 Party introduces final 3 new faces, taking first-timer slate to 14\n\nMore\n\n\u201cAll I knew before this was that you go to Parliament, stand there, and talk about things.\u201d Now, having seen the role up close, he understands that it involves much more \u2013 from managing town council matters to organising events and gathering feedback from residents.\n\nIf elected, he added, he will prioritise his responsibilities as an MP over his current role at Showdrop.\n\nPolitical curiosity\n\nEven before GE2011,\n\nThng had had an interest in politics. He first stepped into Parliament in his early 20s, not as an aspiring politician but as a curious observer in the public gallery, eager to understand the full picture behind policy debates. \u201cI always had an interest and a curiosity around policymaking\u2026 there was no other way I could watch an unedited version of what happened (then).\u201d\n\nHis interest in policymaking led him to pursue a Master in Public Policy at Harvard University after his undergraduate studies. Now, he hopes to combine that policy grounding with his real-world experience \u2013 including as a former consultant at Boston Consulting Group \u2013 to push for change.\n\nEchoing the views of fellow WP newcomer and startup founder\n\nKenneth Tiong\n\n, Thng said his startup experience has shaped his understanding of entrepreneurs\u2019 challenges and the need for stronger early-stage support.\n\nAlthough Singapore offers substantial support for businesses, early-stage startups often fall through the cracks, with help typically available only after a company has gained traction.\n\n\u201cI think there may be a little bit of a gap for companies in the early stage that need that leg up to get to the next, so I think there\u2019s an opportunity there to expand support,\u201d he said.\n\nBeyond the startup ecosystem, one employment-related policy he would like to improve is the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme. Introduced in 2007, WIS helps lower-income workers save for retirement by topping up their salaries.\n\nThng supports its intent, but highlighted one flaw: the scheme is for workers earning no more than S$3,000 in gross monthly income \u2013 including overtime pay.\n\nThis, he said, creates a \u201cweird dynamic\u201d where working overtime could push someone above the threshold and disqualify them from support.\n\nWhile this issue has been raised before, the government has been hesitant in addressing it, and Thng hopes to push for more clarity.\n\nOn the social front, Thng hopes to champion causes such as smaller classes in schools and letting younger singles access public housing. Both are among the\n\n125 policy proposals in the WP manifesto\n\n.\n\nMore diverse Parliament\n\nBringing a private-sector lens to political contestation, Thng likened dominant parties to dominant companies \u2013 both risk becoming resistant to change.\n\nWhen one party controls the political landscape, there tends to be a \u201cflight to safety\u201d among its members, with a preference for stability over change, he said.\n\nThis can stifle innovation within the party, with a focus on preserving the status quo rather than exploring new ideas.\n\n\u201cI believe that if you have a system where there\u2019s a little bit more dynamics in the way in which we debate\u2026 policy gets better and more people get considered in the process.\u201d\n\nNor should people fear that a multi-party Parliament is worse for Singaporeans. Thng stressed that as long as a party holds more than half the seats, it can still pass regular laws.\n\nIt is only in the case of constitutional amendments that a two-thirds supermajority is needed.\n\nTherefore, even in a more diverse Parliament, governance can still function effectively \u2013 as long as a party holds a working majority, he said.\n\nAs for what impact the WP has made in Parliament, Thng pointed to PAP policies that are aligned with what the WP has long advocated.\n\nThese include the Jobseeker Support Scheme for the unemployed, and the Local Qualifying Salary framework that, in effect, sets a minimum wage for employers of foreign workers.\n\nThe goal of opposition parties is not always to have their proposals adopted wholesale, but to help shape policy outcomes through debate and advocacy, he added.\n\n\u201c(It) isn\u2019t about getting exactly what I want every single time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about putting forward a perspective \u2013 and if the other side comes closer to it, and people benefit as a result, then I think that\u2019s (an) impact.\u201d\n\nThe key question is not whether there are more parties in Parliament, but whether they act in good faith, he said.\n\n\u201cSo long as every party that\u2019s participating in democracy is doing it with the right intentions and is doing it with citizenry and with the country in mind\u2026 that kind of consensus building is a net positive for the country.\u201d\n\nFor more election coverage, visit our\n\nGE2025 microsite\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The president\u2019s first 100 days in office in recent decades have been marked by strength in the country\u2019s currency, with returns averaging close to 0.9 per cent between 1973, when Richard Nixon began his second term, and 2021, when Joe Biden took office.\n\nMeant as a temporary measure, the so-called Nixon shock of 1971 caused the US dollar to drop, effectively ending the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates established after the end of the World War II.\n\nTrump during the early innings of his second presidency followed through on various campaign pledges, introducing new tariffs and dialling up the rhetoric against China and other US trading partners. His tariff policy has led investors to pile into assets outside the US, weakening the greenback and lifting other currencies alongside gold. The euro, Swiss franc and yen have risen more than 8 per cent each against the US dollar since Trump\u2019s return to the presidency.\n\n\u201cThe ubiquity of the US dollar and its role in international trade and finance came with deep trust in US institutions, low trade and capital barriers as well as a predictable foreign policy,\u201d said Bipan Rai, a managing director at BMO Global Asset Management. \u201cNow? There are clear signs of erosion which points to a change in global asset allocation trends which don\u2019t favour the US dollar. We sense this is a structural shift,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump\u2019s policy initiatives have also increased the risk of a US recession combined with re-accelerating inflation, limiting the scale of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThe president\u2019s comments about Fed Chair Jerome Powell \u2013 especially his threat to fire him \u2013 have put investors on alert, elevating concerns over the US central bank\u2019s independence.

Analysts stated that the greenback\u2019s performance hinges on the outcome of the US-China stand-off, which hasn\u2019t seen much progress in recent weeks.\n\nDeutsche Bank last week warned of a structural downtrend for the US dollar in the coming years, which could knock the US currency to its weakest level in more than a decade against the euro.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nYen, BOJ's rate policy may remain focus in Japan-US trade talks\n\nSpeculative traders, including hedge funds and asset managers, have increased their bets against the US dollar in April.

He was taken to a county jail for extradition to Nevada, where Clark County, home to Las Vegas, had issued the felony warrant. No further detail on the alleged fraud was provided.\n\nAccording to jail records, he was released the next day.\n\nIn a questionnaire in connection with his nomination to head the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Isaacman said he was returning from the Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, in February 2010 when he was detained by CBP for \u201cdrawing and passing checks without sufficient funds.\u201d\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nFriday, 2 pm\n\nLifestyle\n\nOur picks of the latest dining, travel and leisure options to treat yourself.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nHe said the arrest stemmed from a dispute with the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas over a travel reimbursement the resort promised and failed to honor. Isaacman said he resolved the matter in less than 24 hours and the charges were dismissed. The court records were sealed, he said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Palms Casino declined to comment. A spokesperson for Isaacman declined to comment. \u201cJared Isaacman is exceptionally qualified to advance President Trump\u2019s bold agenda to restore American leadership in space science, technology and exploration,\u201d White House spokesperson Liz Huston said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to the Senate\u2019s swift confirmation of him.\u201d\n\nCourt records from New Jersey and Connecticut filed in 2009 and 2010, respectively, allege the New Jersey native failed to pay casino debts.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nStuck Nasa astronauts one step closer to home after SpaceX crew-swap launch\n\nCivil cases were brought against him by Trump\u2019s now-defunct Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey and the Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, according to court documents.\n\nThe Trump Taj Mahal sued Isaacman in July 2009 in connection with a line of credit he got in November 2005. Isaacman wrote four checks in 2008 for a total of US$1 million but his bank account did not have the funds for them to be cashed, according to the complaint.\n\nThe case was settled in 2011 for US$650,000.\n\nIn a 2010 complaint filed in Connecticut, the Mohegan Sun said Isaacman had written four bad checks totalling US$1 million. That action was eventually resolved and withdrawn, according to a court filing.\n\nIn a subsequent filing for his nomination, Isaacman disclosed four civil casino cases: the two described above, plus another from the Taj Mahal and one from the Trump Plaza, a source familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe other two cases, from 2008, could not immediately be retrieved, according to New Jersey court personnel.\n\nIn a written question submitted after his Apr 9 nomination hearing, Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell asked Isaacman about being detained at the border and sued four times between 2008 and 2010 in connection with casino debts and allegations of fraudulent checks.\n\n\u201cIn my early 20s, I was fortunate to experience business success at a young age, and I spent time in casinos as an immature hobby,\u201d Isaacman answered. \u201cThe legal matters referenced were, in fact, forms of negotiation and were all resolved promptly. The incident at the border, following my return from the Olympics, stemmed from a payment issue that had already been resolved, which is why I was detained for only a few hours.\u201d\n\nIsaacman assured the committee that the behavior was in his past.\n\nStill, while orbiting Earth in a SpaceX capsule in 2021, he placed the first sports bet in Las Vegas from space.

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nPublished Sun, Apr 27, 2025 \u00b7 04:03 PM\n\nFor\n\ncenturies, gold has been the go-to haven asset in times of political and economic uncertainty. Its status as a reliably high-value commodity that can be transported easily and sold anywhere offers a sense of safety when everything else is in turmoil.\n\nNot everyone\u2019s a fan. Famed investor Warren Buffett has called the precious metal a \u201csterile\u201d asset, telling Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in a 2011 letter that \u201cif you own one ounce of gold for an eternity, you will still own one ounce at its end\u201d.\n\nNonetheless, investors have sought refuge in bullion as the trade and geopolitical agendas of US President Donald Trump send equities, bonds and currencies swinging. They have piled into gold-backed exchange-traded funds, with inflows reaching US$21 billion in the first quarter, according to the World Gold Council, the highest level since the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe rush to gold has pushed the spot price to a series of record highs, topping US$3,500 in mid-April and extending a ferocious run from last year. The yellow metal has thus far outperformed nearly every other major asset class in 2025.\n\nDemand in China \u2013 the top bullion producer and consumer \u2013 has been one of the key drivers of gold\u2019s ascent, propelled by concerns about the punitive tariffs US President Donald Trump has placed on US imports of goods from its largest trading partner.\n\nWhy is gold considered a safe haven?\n\nFor modern investors, it is primarily because of gold\u2019s stability and liquidity rather than any intrinsic utility.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nGold has a track record of increasing in value in times of market stress. It is also seen as a hedge against inflation, when the purchasing power of currencies is eroded. Inflation worries are front of mind for many right now as the new duties Trump has imposed on imports into the US, as well as the retaliatory levies introduced by other countries, risk increasing prices across the global economy.\n\nThe safe-haven status of gold has been elevated as Trump\u2019s trade agenda shakes confidence in other typical shelters from market gyrations \u2013 namely the US dollar and government bonds \u2013 and threatens to end the idea of American exceptionalism.\n\nGold has historically been negatively correlated with the US dollar. Because bullion is priced in US dollars, when the greenback weakens, gold becomes cheaper for holders of other currencies. In mid-April, the US dollar was at a three-year low against other major currencies.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nGold set for third straight weekly gain; US-China trade talks in focus\n\nBeyond market movements, owning gold is deeply rooted in Indian and Chinese cultures \u2013 two of the world\u2019s largest markets for the metal \u2013 where jewellery, bars and other forms of bullion are passed down through generations as a symbol of prosperity and security. Indian households own about 25,000 tonnes of gold, more than five times what is stored in the US depository at Fort Knox.\n\nThey are famously sensitive to prices, but when gold\u2019s appeal to investors in financial markets starts to fade, physical buyers of jewellery and bars often step in to grab a bargain, putting a floor under prices in the process.\n\nIs it just trade war fears pushing up the gold price?\n\nThe metal\u2019s blistering price rally since the start of 2024 was partly driven by huge purchases by central banks, particularly in emerging markets as they seek to reduce their dependency on the US dollar, the world\u2019s primary reserve currency. Gold helps diversify a country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves and guard against currency depreciation.\n\nCentral banks have been net buyers of gold for the past 15 years, but the speed of their purchases doubled in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. As the US and its allies froze Russian central bank funds held in their countries, it underscored how foreign currency assets are vulnerable to sanctions.\n\nIn 2024, central banks bought more than 1,000 tonnes of bullion for the third year in a row, according to the World Gold Council, and they hold around a fifth of all the gold that has ever been mined.\n\nThe sustained enthusiasm of central banks spurred Goldman Sachs Group to raise its year-end forecast for the gold price to US$3,700 per ounce in April. It anticipates that US$4,000 could be reached by the middle of next year.\n\nWhat could halt gold\u2019s rally?\n\nFollowing a nearly uninterrupted upward march in the gold price since early last year, there could eventually be some consolidation as investors banks their gains. A major de-escalation of Trump\u2019s tariffs and a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine could also spur a price decline.\n\nBut central banks have been the most important pillar of support for gold\u2019s bullish momentum, meaning they have the power to do the most damage if they trim their reserves.\n\nThere is no indication any large holder is considering this. The central banks of developed economies have sold very little gold in recent decades compared to the 1990s, when persistent sales sent bullion prices down by more than a quarter over the decade. Amid concerns that those uncoordinated sales were destabilising the market, the first Central Bank Gold Agreement was struck in 1999, under which signatories agreed to limit their collective sales of bullion.\n\nDoes gold being a physical asset cause any issues for investors?\n\nOwning gold typically is not free. Because it is a physical object, holders have to pay for storage, security and insurance.\n\nInvestors buying gold bars and coins will usually pay a premium over the spot price. There can be geographic price differentials too and traders take advantage of these arbitrage opportunities.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened earlier this year when fears that Trump could introduce tariffs on bullion imports pushed gold futures on New York\u2019s Comex significantly above spot prices in London. There was a worldwide dash among those in possession of the physical metal to shift it to the US to capture the large premium and potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in profit.\n\nGold is usually relatively simple to shift, stashed away in the cargo holds of commercial aircraft, unbeknown to the holiday and business travellers in the cabin above. But it is not as straightforward as loading up a jet from Heathrow Airport to JFK thanks to a quirk in the global gold market: different size requirements. In London, 400-ounce bars are the standard, while for Comex contracts, traders must deliver 100-ounce or one-kilogramme bars.\n\nThat means bullion being sent to Comex warehouses has to first go to refiners in Switzerland to be melted down and recast to the correct dimensions, before journeying on to the US. This creates a bottleneck when there is a particular rush to rejig the location of bullion stocks.

PHOTO: TAY CHU YI, BT\n\n[SINGAPORE] Politicians warned about the storm ahead \u2013 but differed in how to face it, in the first party political broadcasts on Friday (Apr 25) night.\n\nPrime Minister Lawrence Wong said that the People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) offers the best team to take Singapore through uncertainty, while some opposition parties proposed ways to tackle cost-of-living woes.\n\nEight parties \u2013 those fielding at least six candidates \u2013 are eligible for the broadcast, with airtime allocated based on candidate numbers. The second and final round of broadcasts will be on May 1 \u2013 the last day of campaigning.\n\nSix parties delivered messages in all four official languages, while the National Solidarity Party and People\u2019s Power Party made speeches in English, Chinese and Malay.\n\nHere is an overview of each party\u2019s English broadcast.\n\nPeople\u2019s Action Party\n\nPrime Minister Lawrence Wong, secretary-general\n\nThis election\u2019s outcome will shape how effective the government will be, and how ready Singapore is to \u201cforge a new path forward together in these uncertain times\u201d, said PM Wong.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nSome Singaporeans want the People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) to keep governing, yet also want alternative voices in Parliament, he noted. \u201cI too believe there is a role for a constructive and responsible opposition in our system of democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I would like to make a personal appeal to you \u2013 not just as the secretary-general of the PAP, but also as your prime minister.\u201d\n\nHe warned that after the general election, the contest is not between the PAP and the opposition, but between Singapore and a turbulent world.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nGE2025: Candidates rebut rally comments on Day 3, with political broadcasts to come\n\nIf the PAP wins a mandate, his \u201cforemost responsibility\u201d will be to unite Singaporeans, protect livelihoods and secure the future, he noted. \u201cI will not gamble with your lives, your jobs or your well-being.\u201d\n\nPM Wong drew parallels between historical moments \u2013 Singapore\u2019s separation from Malaysia and the later withdrawal of British troops \u2013 and the current situation.\n\n\u201cIn short, the external conditions that have underpinned our survival, security and success for decades are now coming apart,\u201d he pointed out. Who forms the government is an \u201cexistential question\u201d, not merely a political one. \u201cSo I ask you to equip yourself with the best team for this changed world.\u201d\n\nHe added that the government is closely monitoring the tariff situation, and will step up support if conditions worsen. \u201cEven as we help Singaporeans cope with the immediate economic concerns, the PAP government will always look ahead, to plan for and prepare Singaporeans for the future.\u201d\n\nWorkers\u2019 Party\n\nPritam Singh, secretary-general\n\n\u201cIt is important for Singapore\u2019s democracy for the WP to win more constituencies,\u201d said Workers\u2019 Party (WP) chief Pritam Singh, while reiterating that it will not form the next government.\n\nMore WP constituencies mean a higher chance of a \u201cfully elected democratic opposition presence\u201d for the longer term, he added. \u201cThis will make our system stable and sustainable for the future.\u201d\n\nBuilding for the future is one of three ways that WP works for Singaporeans, said Singh, alongside working in Parliament and in town councils.\n\nIn Parliament, the WP asks \u201ctough questions\u201d that PAP MPs may not. WP MPs can oppose measures they believe are not in the national interest \u2013 but also support government moves when it is \u201cright to do so\u201d.\n\nHe recalled how, in March 2023, there were not enough PAP MPs to pass a constitutional amendment. The WP had assessed this to be in Singapore\u2019s interest \u2013 and voted for it to pass. \u201cThe Workers\u2019 Party is there in Parliament working for you when it counts.\u201d\n\nThe WP also runs town councils \u201cas well as the PAP does\u201d, said Singh. The two town councils it manages received the highest rating possible in the Ministry of National Development\u2019s 2024 report.\n\nRed Dot United\n\nRavi Philemon, secretary-general\n\nRed Dot United (RDU) leader Ravi Philemon said: \u201cWe\u2019re here because something feels broken in the country we call home. And we believe we can fix it \u2013 together.\u201d\n\nQuestioning if Singaporeans truly benefit from growth, he noted: \u201cIf growth only shows up in freehold property values and luxury cars, while you\u2019re tightening your belt to pay your electricity bill \u2013 then that\u2019s not prosperity. That\u2019s inequality.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated the idea of a Citizens Dividend, giving Singaporeans a \u201crightful share of the wealth\u201d they helped create.\n\nOther proposals ranged from housing \u2013 such as more rental flats for young singles and low-income families \u2013 to healthcare. On fairness, RDU will prioritise citizens in housing, jobs and opportunities.\n\nFinally, more data must be made public, he added. \u201cIn a knowledge-based economy, we must relook laws that stifle critical thinking and honest discussion.\u201d\n\nProgress Singapore Party\n\nTan Cheng Bock, chairman\n\nProgress Singapore Party (PSP) chairman Tan Cheng Bock asked if Singaporeans want a Parliament made up of \u201ca small group of elites that engages in group think\u201d.\n\nWhat the country needs, he said, is a more balanced Parliament with diverse views and a loyal opposition offering constructive alternatives.\n\nHe noted that many new PAP candidates are from the civil service or military, and many \u201cwill be parachuted into Parliament alongside ministers in safe GRCs\u201d.\n\nThe PSP\u2019s 13 candidates have bravely put themselves forward, he added. If elected, the PSP will speak up \u201cfearlessly\u201d, as its Non-Constituency MPs have done.\n\nIt will also push the government to adopt its policy proposals, for inclusive social and economic progress.\n\nPeople\u2019s Alliance for Reform\n\nLim Tean, secretary-general\n\nSingapore can provide free education, school meals and healthcare for children without taxing citizens further or dipping into the reserves, said People\u2019s Alliance for Reform (PAR) chief Lim Tean. If elected, PAR will push for these policies to improve Singapore\u2019s \u201cdisastrous\u201d total fertility rate of 0.97.\n\n\u201cContinuous net immigration\u201d has grave consequences for cohesion, he added, calling it a \u201cpseudo solution\u201d by the ruling party, whose policies \u201chave driven the cost of living through the roof\u201d.\n\nThe PAP\u2019s answer to anxieties about housing affordability, job insecurity and overcrowding is to give out vouchers and subsidies \u2013 but Singaporeans are not looking for handouts, he noted. \u201cThey are looking for meaningful work which gives them dignity and a purpose in life.\u201d\n\nSingapore Democratic Party\n\nAlfred Tan, candidate for Sembawang GRC\n\nIf elected, the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) will work to lower costs and empower Singaporeans, said party member Alfred Tan.\n\nOn costs, the party proposes cutting the goods and services tax and scrapping it for essentials; a \u201cnon-open market\u201d public housing scheme; and lowering healthcare expenses.\n\nOn empowering Singaporeans, it suggests prioritising citizens for jobs; introducing a minimum wage; and providing support for mental health.\n\nPeople\u2019s Power Party\n\nVere Nathan, candidate for Tampines GRC\n\nSingaporeans must choose leaders who will lead with integrity, transparency and accountability, said People\u2019s Power Party (PPP) candidate for Tampines GRC Vere Nathan.\n\n\u201cTrust cannot be derived from the system of \u2018ownself checks ownself\u2019, but through a rigorous process of proper independent checks and balances,\u201d he said, warning that losing trust in government would be \u201cmore catastrophic\u201d than any economic or external threat.\n\nNational Solidarity Party\n\nReno Fong, president\n\nFor \u201cfar too long\u201d, Singaporeans have been told that \u201cthis is as good as it gets\u201d, said National Solidarity Party (NSP)  president Reno Fong. Yet families are working harder than ever amid rising costs; young people are weighed down by the education system; and seniors worry about Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings.\n\nNSP will therefore fight for a minimum living wage, reform the CPF system and prioritise small businesses. It will also abolish streaming and price BTO flats at cost, among other ideas.\n\nFor more election coverage, visit our\n\nGE2025 microsite\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

PHOTO: BIG FISH PUBLISHING\n\n[\n\nShanghai\n\n] If scale equals significance, then the Shanghai motor show (official name: Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition) is indisputably the world\u2019s most important car event.\n\nRunning from Apr 25 to May 2, the 2025 edition sprawls across 360,000 sq m, more than twice as large as Vivocity, with nearly a million visitors expected to trek through its halls. At the heart of this year\u2019s edition is a clear, striking narrative: the audacious rise of China\u2019s home-grown car brands.\n\nMany of them are fledgling by any standard \u2013 some are not even old enough to have started school \u2013 but at Shanghai it\u2019s clear that they are making bold, coordinated moves to expand at home and overseas, and fast.\n\nThat marks a turning point. Not long ago, Chinese companies bought storied foreign brands like Volvo and MG to borrow their design talent and hard-won heritage, seeing it as a shortcut to credibility.\n\nBut Shanghai 2025 makes it clear that Chinese automakers no longer aim to acquire prestige, instead betting on their own technology and design vision to carry their brands.\n\nConsider Avatr, a name unfamiliar to most outside of China for now. The brand launched its first model less than three years ago, but at Shanghai it is introducing its fourth car, the 06, a sleek four-door electric sedan developed to go head-to-head with the Tesla Model 3.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nFriday, 2 pm\n\nLifestyle\n\nOur picks of the latest dining, travel and leisure options to treat yourself.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nIts structure uses submarine-grade steel and aerospace aluminium, and Avatr claims it\u2019s the first car in the world to meet Euro NCAP\u2019s 2026 crash standards. It says that in its own 100 kmh collision test, the bodyshell showed no cabin intrusion, with all four doors remaining fully openable in the aftermath.\n\nEarlier this month, Avatr declared its intention to enter 50 new markets by year\u2019s end. Singapore is among them, and\n\nThe Business Times\n\nunderstands that a local distributor has already been appointed.\n\nZeekr is pushing forcefully into the premium segment. At the show, its CEO An Conghui presented two extremes of the brand\u2019s luxury ambitions. PHOTO: BIG FISH PUBLISHING\n\nAmbition runs equally high at Zeekr, a four-year-old nameplate from the Geely group. While Avatr targets the mass-market electric vehicle crowd, Zeekr is pushing forcefully into the premium segment. At the show, its chief executive officer An Conghui presented two extremes of the brand\u2019s luxury ambitions.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nDeepal S07 review: Friendly, but competitive\n\nTo his left stood an opulent reinterpretation of the Zeekr 009 Grand, a four-seat electric multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) fitted with a 43-inch rear screen and ornamented with at least 3 grams of 24-karat gold. BT estimates that if launched here, it could command a price near S$900,000 at today\u2019s Certificate of Entitlement levels.\n\nTo An\u2019s right was another bold statement, the 9X, a hybrid sport utility vehicle (SUV) of grand proportions that Chinese netizens have dubbed the country\u2019s own Rolls-Royce Cullinan. The design team, led by former Bentley styling chief Stefan Sielaff, sees the comparison as apt. \u201cI would even add one word,\u201d Sielaff told a media gathering at a Zeekr conference a day before the show. \u201cThe word is \u2018better\u2019.\u201d\n\nWith 885 horsepower from twin electric motors and a 0-100 kmh time of three seconds, the 9X leans heavily on performance, but is more striking for its physical presence. With its squared-off stance, huge upright grille and clean surfacing, it projects the sort of gravitas and authority that a car would need to take on Range Rovers or the Bentley Bentayga, which Sielaff had a hand in designing.\n\nWith its squared-off stance, huge upright grille and clean surfacing, the Zeekr 9X projects the sort of gravitas and authority that a car would need to take on Range Rovers or the Bentley Bentayga. PHOTO: BIG FISH PUBLISHING\n\nAbove all, the yacht-inspired 9X telegraphs Zeekr\u2019s intention to penetrate the luxury arena, where margins are fatter. That\u2019s a space BYD also covets, having already become China\u2019s runaway leader in the mass market for electric and hybrid cars.\n\nThe Denza Z is a low-slung, two-seat concept aimed squarely at Porsche\u2019s 911. PHOTO: BIG FISH PUBLISHING\n\nBYD used Shanghai to showcase its aspirations through Denza, its upmarket label. On display was the Denza Z, a low-slung, two-seat concept aimed squarely at Porsche\u2019s 911. While Denza didn\u2019t release details, the Z will likely follow the Chinese car industry playbook to a tee: deliver more performance and more tech at a lower price.\n\nBYD\u2019s even pricier Yangwang marque revealed the U8L, a stretched version of its technology-laden flagship SUV. While the basic U8\u2019s ability to perform tank turns and float across rivers has earned it online fame, that hasn\u2019t yet translated into volume. Yangwang only sold 524 cars in China during the first quarter of the year, showing that prestige can be a tricky business.\n\nHongqi\u2019s styling is overseen by Giles Taylor, whose last job was head of design at Rolls-Royce. Its Shanghai line-up includes a hybrid version of the HS9 SUV. PHOTO: BIG FISH PUBLISHING\n\nFor now, the brand most closely aligned with traditional luxury values remains Hongqi, a nameplate that once symbolised Chinese pride by building cars for minister-level officials. Its styling is overseen by Giles Taylor, whose last job was head of design at Rolls-Royce, and its Shanghai line-up includes hybrid versions of the HS9 SUV and H9 sedan, along with the Guoya, a stately limousine aimed at the wealthy elite.\n\nBT understands Hongqi is in final talks with a distributor here, and estimates its luxury models will start at around S$700,000, rising to S$1.4 million for the Guoya. Given the pricing, it would be wise for Hongqi to appoint a dealership with a database of customers who can afford Rolls-Royces.\n\nDeepal is using the show as a chance to collect pre-launch sales of the upcoming S09, a six-seat SUV that starts from just under 240,000 yuan in China. PHOTO: BIG FISH PUBLISHING\n\nBut sales volume keeps the lights on more than prestige, and Shanghai had its share of rising stars, such as Deepal, a newer brand under state-owned Changan that Premium Automobiles launched in Singapore in March.\n\nIt took Deepal 14 months to sell its first 100,000 cars, but it now comfortably moves more than 20,000 units a month. The company is using Shanghai as a chance to collect pre-launch sales of the upcoming S09, a six-seat SUV that starts from just under 240,000 yuan (S$43,234) in China, looking to build on momentum.\n\nLeapmotor, a startup that appointed Cycle & Carriage its distributor in Singapore, is seeing similar sales growth. Its March tally in China was 37,095 cars, a 154.7 per cent year-on-year increase, enough to propel it to fifth place on domestic sales charts for \u201cnew energy\u201d vehicles, meaning full electrics or plug-ins. Deepal, which only released its first car in 2022, broke into the top 10.\n\nThat kind of rapid ascent suggests that success isn\u2019t built on nostalgia, but on carmakers\u2019 ability to woo domestic buyers with a combination of efficiency, technology and style. If those attributes resonate overseas, legacy car companies will be studying Shanghai carefully, where all three are on full display.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There\u2019s little sign of him changing that view, so markets remain cautious,\u201d said Tsuyoshi Ueno, senior economist at NLI Research Institute.\n\n\u201cIf next week\u2019s trade negotiations between Akazawa and Bessent do not go well, Washington\u2019s attention could turn towards exchange rates again,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Treasury Department said in a readout on Friday that Bessent and Kato had held productive discussions across a broad range of bilateral issues, including reciprocal trade. They \u201caffirmed their intention to continue their ongoing close consultations regarding issues related to exchange rates,\u201d it said.\n\nBOJ rate hikes\n\nAnother key sign was Kato\u2019s remark that he explained to Bessent Japan\u2019s recent economic developments \u201cincluding wage hikes.\u201d He added that in doing so, he also talked about Japan\u2019s \u201cprice developments.\u201d\n\nThat suggests discussions may have touched upon Japan\u2019s monetary policy, as both wages and prices are key to the timing and pace of further interest rate hikes by the BOJ.\n\nSources have told Reuters the slow pace at which the BOJ is raising borrowing costs from ultra-low levels could come under fire in bilateral trade talks.\n\nSteady rises in wages and inflation were key to the BOJ\u2019s decision to exit a massive stimulus last year and raise its short-term interest rate to 0.5 per cent in January.\n\nWith inflation exceeding its 2 per cent target for three consecutive years and big firms continuing to offer bumper pay hikes this year, the BOJ has signaled its readiness to keep raising rates.\n\nBut the central bank\u2019s rate-hike path has been complicated by Trump\u2019s tariffs, which threaten to derail Japan\u2019s fragile economic recovery and have prodded analysts to push back the expected timing of the next rate increase.\n\nWhile warning of heightening economic uncertainty, BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda on Thursday repeated the central bank\u2019s readiness to keep hiking rates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s notable that Kato and Bessent likely discussed Japan\u2019s wage developments,\u201d said Katsuhiro Oshima, chief economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, adding that Ueda\u2019s remarks suggest the BOJ remains on course to hike rates.\n\n\u201cWage hikes would be a win for Japan\u2019s economy, a win for the US from the perspective of exchange rates, a win for Japanese households which will see purchasing power increase, and a win for the BOJ by making it easier to raise rates.\u201d REUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in International\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:54 PM\n\nSuspended Thailand PM Paetongtarn hit by ethics investigation, source and media say\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:07 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/3d780fbf82018095333f0d350c512d384375115c0e535eefc127b0d844eb4c99?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: A man in a bicycle drives past containers at an industrial port in Tokyo, Japan, May 22, 2019.

This is the art of negotiation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy we can do it well is because of the support of each and every one of you,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you give me the mandate, I will never worry \u2013 when I go out and negotiate a deal, my back is supported by all of you.\u201d\n\nFellow Chua Chu Kang candidate Jeffrey Siow made a similar point, saying: \u201cThis is serious.

And if they do, who suffers in the end? It is Singaporeans,\u201d he said.\n\nSingapore\u2019s small size means it cannot be insular, unlike countries such as the US, he added. Singapore would pay a huge price if it closed its doors, \u201cespecially at a time of great uncertainty and turbulence\u201d.\n\nAt the East Coast rally, anchor minister Edwin Tong noted that many MNCs here are US companies, and Singapore will face \u201cserious problems\u201d if US tariffs make it hard for them to stay.\n\nCiting a Workers\u2019 Party (WP) proposal to tax MNCs more, he said: \u201cThis can raise revenue, but what will this do to MNCs?\u201d\n\nMNCs provide the majority of good-paying jobs for Singaporeans, and their departure would result in the loss of these, he said.\n\nKnown and trusted\n\nPM Wong and SM Teo said that amid global uncertainty, DPM Gan is a key figure \u2013 leading tariff talks with the US, as well as heading Singapore\u2019s task force to help businesses and workers cope.\n\nIn a last-minute swap on Nomination Day,\n\nDPM Gan left Chua Chu Kang GRC\n\nto head the PAP\u2019s Punggol team against a WP slate of star newcomers.\n\nPM Wong related how, in the midst of campaigning, DPM Gan had to take an important Zoom call with US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick.\n\nThough the US said that baseline tariffs will remain unchanged, DPM Gan had a \u201cgood discussion on how we can facilitate key exports\u201d, said PM Wong.\n\n\u201cThe Commerce Secretary agreed that the US will consider this and told Gan Kim Yong, \u2018We trust you\u2019,\u201d he added.\n\nAt the Punggol rally, DPM Gan said that US representatives are willing to talk because of a \u201clongstanding partnership\u201d with the PAP government.\n\n\u201cThey know us and they trust us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this mutual trust is most critical in terms of crisis, for us to be able to come together, to talk with one another and to negotiate.\u201d\n\nFor more election coverage, visit our\n\nGE2025 microsite\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The central nave is lined by 40 Ionic columns and contains exquisite mosaics.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nHuge crowds pack Vatican for last day of Pope's lying in state\n\nOne legend ties the basilica to the Virgin Mary from its origins. It says that a childless wealthy Roman couple wanted to donate their possessions to the Virgin Mary.\n\nShe appeared to them in a vision and told them to build a church in her honour, where a miracle would take place. Snow fell that summer night in August 352 on the hill where the basilica now stands.\n\nAnother legend has Pope Liberius being told in a dream of the summer snowfall.\n\nAccording to the Vatican, however, nothing remains of that original church. Construction of the current basilica began around 432 under Pope Sixtus III.\n\nThe basilica holds some of the Church\u2019s most important relics, including an icon of the Virgin Mary holding the baby Jesus, attributed to Saint Luke.\n\nIt also holds pieces of wood believed to have been from Jesus\u2019s crib. The basilica\u2019s website says recent studies have dated the wood from the period of Jesus\u2019s birth.

And that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking to the Chinese about.\u201d\n\nBanga said the Trump administration\u2019s criticisms of the World Bank, which included \u201cexpansive policy overreach,\u201d were not unusual, citing newly elected governments in countries including France, Japan and Korea.\n\n\u201cI keep telling people this is a perfectly constructive request, to say, tell me and show me that you guys are the kind of people that advance the interests of my taxpayer, of my country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI take it in that spirit,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with it.\u201d\n\nEnergy at \u2018lowest possible cost\u2019\n\nSince taking the helm of the Washington-based development lender in 2023, Banga has pushed to streamline operations and encourage private sector participation, while focusing on job creation and electricity connectivity.\n\nAmong the Bank\u2019s current priorities is a push with the African Development Bank to connect 300 million people in sub-Saharan Africa to electricity by 2030 \u2013 a process that will require a vast amount of new energy to be brought online.\n\n\u201cYou should try and get (energy) in the best, accessible way and the lowest possible cost,\u201d Banga said, suggesting that in addition to renewable power, nuclear and gas could help provide a base load \u2013 two energy sources the World Bank is currently hesitant to finance.\n\nThe Bank\u2019s executive board is set to discuss its energy strategy in June, Banga said, adding that funding for both nuclear and gas would likely be on the agenda.\n\nBanga said the Bank is also pushing to encourage private sector job creation in developing countries \u2013 beyond simply outsourcing jobs from advanced economies.\n\n\u201cBecause then you end up with challenges in (advanced economies), and you can see that people are speaking about them with their votes,\u201d he added.

The demand for smaller spaces is driven mainly by non-bank financial service firms such as wealth management and hedge fund companies.\n\nLower discretionary spending expected\n\nAs for its retail segment, the Reit manager said that retail sales is likely to stay subdued due to cautious consumer spending. Retailers are also projected to adopt a cautious expansion strategy amid the weaker economic outlook.\n\nChong Kee Hiong, the chief executive officer of the Reit manager, said that discretionary spending will be \u201cthe first to be hit\u201d as a result of the tariffs.\n\nFor instance, consumers may cut back on items like apparel, or eat at food courts rather than restaurants.\n\nNevertheless, Chong said that the Singapore dollar could soften in the coming months, making it more expensive for consumers to spend overseas. This could have a positive effect on retail sales in Singapore in the coming months.\n\nConvention centre\u2019s performance to stay stable\n\nIn its outlook for the convention centre sector, the manager said that the uncertainty caused by the tariffs may force event organisers to tighten their budget for conferences. This may result in lower attendance for events.\n\nHowever, Chong said that the manager has yet to observe any signs of the sector\u2019s performance weakening due to the tariffs. No conference organiser has asked to delay or downsize their conferences because of the tariffs. There are also no signs, so far, that attendance would be affected, he said.\n\nHe expects performance for the Reit\u2019s convention segment to remain stable this year.\n\nThe counter closed S$0.01 or 0.9 per cent lower at S$1.15 on Friday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It came after some mourners took selfies \u2013 deemed by many disrespectful \u2013 with the coffin.\n\nAfter the funeral, Francis\u2019s coffin will be driven at a walking pace to be buried at his favourite church, Rome\u2019s papal basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore.

Didi has been offering limited taxi services in Hong Kong for some time, but lacks a ride-share option.\n\nAn advertisement viewed by Bloomberg News invites prospective ride-share drivers to scan a QR code and download an app called KayGo Driver.\n\nKayGo is recruiting drivers for Didi, according to a person familiar with the matter. KayGo\u2019s drivers will gradually start providing their service to Didi users in Hong Kong, the person said.\n\nA Google Play store listing for KayGo features a black and white cartoon gorilla. The description says the app is an \u201corder-taking platform specially created for drivers.\u201d\n\nThe listing includes a link to a KayGo website for drivers, which in turn contains links to Didi\u2019s own site. The app\u2019s developer is listed as Kaygo Ltd., carrying a Singapore address but a Hong Kong phone number. The app, updated last week, has been downloaded more than 100 times from the Google Play store.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nDidi did not respond to a request for comment.

The company did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.\n\nDidi, known as China\u2019s answer to Uber, has been expanding internationally in recent years. It aims to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange, though the timeline remains unclear.\n\nDidi is among a group of Chinese tech companies including Meituan that are chasing growth overseas as they are faced with prolonged economic uncertainties at home.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nDidi reports 7.1% revenue rise, swings to Q4 loss\n\nDidi\u2019s self-driving unit said to seek funds at US$5 billion value\n\nDidi again records a profit while it prepares for Hong Kong IPO\n\nHong Kong last year unveiled long-anticipated but vague plans to regulate ride-hailing services including Uber in a city infamous for the low quality of its local taxi services. Officials have said more details on a proposed plan should be released this year.\n\nUber launched in Hong Kong in 2014 and seven years later acquired the HKTaxi app, a popular platform used to hire cabs. Uber also offers Uber Taxi, which allows taxi bookings through the firm\u2019s own app.\n\nHong Kong taxi drivers in 2023 threatened to go on strike to protest the government\u2019s unwillingness to regulate ride-hailing services. Uber\u2019s presence has made it a target of Hong Kong\u2019s taxi industry, which says Uber deprives it of revenue each day and creates unfair competition.\n\nUber has said it welcomes the government\u2019s plan to regulate ride-hailing platforms.

PHOTO: YEN MENG JIIN, BT\n\nAs\n\nnomination D\n\nay unfolded for Singapore\u2019s 2025 General Election (GE2025), a striking trend emerged: the significant number of legal professionals stepping forward as candidates across party lines.\n\nLawyers turned candidates for the first time include Gho Sze Kee, Cassandra Lee, and Marshall Lim of the People\u2019s Action Party (PAP), and Harpreet Singh Nehal of the Workers\u2019 Party (WP). Lawyers are making their presence felt in this electoral cycle. This pattern invites a deeper examination of what these legal minds bring to Singapore\u2019s governance, and why their participation matters for the nation\u2019s future.\n\nA tradition of legal expertise in politics\n\nSingapore\u2019s politics has historically welcomed legal professionals, beginning with founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, himself Cambridge-trained in law. This tradition continues with current stalwarts like K Shanmugam, who has served as minister for law since 2008; Edwin Tong, minister for culture, community and youth; Indranee Rajah, minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office and second minister for finance; and Murali Pillai, minister of state for transport and law. All of them are senior counsels.\n\nIn the history of Singapore, only 100 senior counsels have ever been appointed. Beyond these distinguished senior legal figures, many other lawyers have made significant contributions to governance, including Desmond Lee, who has served as minister for national development since 2020. Their contributions have demonstrated how legal training can translate effectively to governance.\n\nThe current election sees this tradition evolving with fresh faces. The PAP\u2019s new candidates who are lawyers include Gho Sze Kee (shipping lawyer), Cassandra Lee (who has legal expertise in corporate matters) and Marshall Lim (former deputy public prosecutor).\n\nThey join PAP members like Alex Yeo, Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim, Christopher de Souza, Hany Soh, Nadia Ahmad Samdin, Patrick Tay, Rahayu Mahzam and Vikram Nair in bringing diverse legal perspectives into the political arena. A quick count reveals that the PAP is fielding at least 16 out of 97 candidates who are legally trained in GE2025.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nOn the opposition front, the WP has fielded several lawyers as new candidates, including Sufyan Mikhail Putra,  Alia Mattar, Fadli Fawzi and Harpreet Singh (who is a senior counsel), while Andre Low holds a law degree. They join other legally trained experienced candidates including Dennis Tan, He Ting Ru, Sylvia Lim and party leader Pritam Singh. That is nine of the 26 candidates the WP is fielding in this election.\n\nOther opposition parties have also fielded lawyers, such as Lim Tean of Peoples Voice and Stephanie Tan of the Progress Singapore Party.\n\nWhat lawyers uniquely contribute\n\nEach represents not just legal acumen, but specialised knowledge in different legal domains that could inform various aspects of legislation, from maritime law to corporate governance, criminal justice to constitutional principles.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nGE2025: Candidates rebut rally comments on Day 3, with political broadcasts to come\n\nGE2025: Highlights from Day 2 of campaigning\n\nGE2025: Campaigning kicks into high gear following suspenseful Nomination Day\n\nLegal professionals bring distinct advantages to parliamentary service. Their training fosters precise analytical thinking, and the ability to identify unforeseen consequences in policy proposals. Years of practice in constructing and challenging arguments prepare them to scrutinise legislation with thoroughness and rigour that can improve legislative outcomes.\n\nFor example, Edwin Tong\u2019s path from senior counsel to ministry leadership demonstrates how legal expertise transfers to policy implementation. His experience handling complex commercial cases equipped him with the skills to navigate multifaceted policy challenges, particularly in culturally sensitive domains where principles must be carefully balanced against pragmatic considerations.\n\nLawyers are skilled at balancing competing interests while maintaining fundamental principles \u2013 a skill directly applicable to public policy. In Singapore\u2019s context, where legislation must navigate delicate multicultural considerations alongside economic imperatives, this capacity becomes especially valuable.\n\nBeyond technical skills, legal training emphasises the importance of procedural fairness and accountability. Lawyers understand that how decisions are made can be as important as the decisions themselves \u2013 an insight that strengthens democratic institutions.\n\nA bridge between policy and implementation\n\nThe prevalence of lawyers in Singapore\u2019s political landscape also speaks to the unique position they occupy between policy formation and practical implementation. Their professional experience bridges the gap between aspirational goals and workable solutions.\n\nTake Marshall Lim\u2019s background as a former deputy public prosecutor. This experience provides first-hand insight into how criminal justice policies affect real people and communities. Similarly, shipping lawyers like Gho Sze Kee understand the practical implications of maritime regulations on Singapore\u2019s status as a global port and trading hub.\n\nThis practical dimension means legally trained politicians can anticipate implementation challenges and design more effective legislation. Their experience navigating regulatory frameworks allows them to construct policies that achieve their intended aims while minimising unintended consequences \u2013 a particularly valuable skill in Singapore\u2019s efficiency-focused governance model.\n\nFurthermore, legal professionals are bound by strict ethical codes that emphasise integrity, independence and duty to uphold justice. When these values transfer to political service, they can strengthen governance standards. The legal profession\u2019s emphasis on evidence-based reasoning also promotes fact-based policy development over purely ideological positions.\n\nAnother valuable dimension lawyers bring to politics is their training in clear, persuasive communication. The ability to distil complex issues into understandable terms and construct compelling arguments serves politicians well in both parliamentary debate and public engagement.\n\nIn an era where public discourse often suffers from oversimplification, legally trained politicians can elevate debate by introducing nuance while maintaining accessibility \u2013 a delicate balance that strengthens democratic participation.\n\nWhy senior counsel candidates generate special interest\n\nCurrently, the PAP has four senior counsels running in GE2025, and the WP has one. The senior counsel appointment represents the pinnacle of Singapore\u2019s legal profession \u2013 recognition of exceptional ability, knowledge and integrity. When these distinguished jurists enter politics, they bring unparalleled depth of expertise in constitutional matters, regulatory frameworks and complex legal considerations that affect national policy.\n\nTheir presence on either side of the political divide signals the importance all parties place on high-calibre legal thinking in addressing Singapore\u2019s challenges. For voters, these candidates represent a commitment to evidence-based policymaking and rigorous analysis that transcends partisanship.\n\nProfessional diversity\n\nWhile the legal profession\u2019s strong showing is notable, Singapore benefits most from a Parliament that reflects diverse professional backgrounds. The complexity of issues facing the nation \u2013 from technological disruption to climate adaptation \u2013 demands varied expertise. Engineers bring technical innovation, educators understand social development, healthcare professionals grasp public health priorities, and business leaders comprehend economic realities.\n\nThe ideal Parliament is not dominated by any single profession, but rather harnesses complementary perspectives. Lawyers who recognise this understand their role is not to monopolise discourse, but to contribute their specialised skills within a broader collaborative framework.\n\nAs Singapore navigates increasingly complex governance challenges \u2013 from digital regulation to geopolitical positioning \u2013 legally trained parliamentarians will play a vital role in crafting sophisticated responses. Their ability to parse nuanced implications, anticipate legal challenges and draft precise legislation provides a foundation for effective governance.\n\nThe number of lawyers contesting in GE2025 reflects recognition of these challenges. Their participation signals a commitment to bringing specialised expertise to public service at a moment when Singapore faces transformation in its economic model, social compact and international relations.\n\nFor Singaporean voters, this trend offers the promise of rigorous debate and well-considered policy. The presence of legal professionals across party lines ensures that regardless of electoral outcomes, the nation\u2019s laws will benefit from informed scrutiny and principled development \u2013 a cornerstone of Singapore\u2019s continued prosperity and stability.\n\nThe question is not whether lawyers should participate in politics, but how their specialised knowledge can best serve the public interest alongside other forms of expertise.\n\nAs Singapore voters make their choices in GE2025, they would do well to consider not just party affiliations, but the complementary skills and perspectives candidates bring to the complex task of governance. In this context, the strong showing of legal professionals represents an opportunity to enhance the quality of Singapore\u2019s already robust parliamentary tradition.\n\nThe writer is a law lecturer at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, a visiting fellow in law at the University of Reading and a practising lawyer at RHTLaw Asia\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG\n\nIt is\n\nquite\u00a0easy to do bad deals in asset management. Option one, overpay for a private capital business in the aggressive dash for growth. Option two, defensively merge your existing fund manager with a regional peer and botch the integration as you try to make savings.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Nomura Holdings\u2019 decision to acquire a cheap US public-markets manager with minimal overlap stands as an oddity. Maybe there is some logic in buying what everyone else is trying to sell.\n\nThe investment industry\u2019s well-known problem is that active fund management is trapped between low-fee passive funds and high-charging alternative strategies promising juicy returns, like hedge funds and private equity. This \u201cbarbell\u201d,\u00a0as Oliver Wyman\u2019s\u00a0Huw van Steenis named the phenomenon, is not easy to deal with if you are already a big active player.\n\nLately, it has spawned acquisitions of\u00a0private capital firms. BlackRock agreed to pay US$13 billion for infrastructure investors\u00a0Global Infrastructure Partners and US$12\u00a0billion for private credit manager HPS Investment Partners last year\u00a0\u2013 high prices relative to the near-term fee income obtained.\n\nMeanwhile, the existing private equity firms have been looking to diversify into infrastructure and private credit, too. It has been a fantastic time for founders of such alternative investment firms to cash in.\n\nConventional asset management tie-ups and joint ventures have also picked up \u2013 witness transactions involving insurer Assicurazioni Generali, Natixis Investment Managers, AXA and BNP Paribas.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nScale brings efficiency. The risks are culture clashes, client withdrawals and distraction. In the US, Invesco\u2019s 2019 acquisition of OppenheimerFunds has not delivered for shareholders. In Europe, the merged Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management destroyed 80 per cent of its market value.\n\nNomura\u2019s agreement this week to pay US$1.8 billion for the US and European asset management arm of Macquarie Group has a lot to do with what is happening\u00a0in private equity.\n\nThe Australian seller built the business through multiple acquisitions starting in 2010. But the fact is that Macquarie is synonymous with infrastructure. When BlackRock as well as Blackstone and KKR & Co are\u00a0coming for your core business, it makes sense to focus on that fight. Macquarie\u2019s only remaining public market activities will be in its home market,\u00a0where its name is a clear advantage.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nJapan\u2019s Nomura to buy Macquarie\u2019s US, European asset management units for A$2.8 billion\n\nThe puzzle is why a Japanese bank is the buyer here. Sure, the deal grows Nomura\u2019s managed assets around 30 per cent to US$770 billion. But the acquired business is overwhelmingly American;\u00a0Nomura has no significant cost-saving opportunity. And active fund management is not\u00a0a powerful\u00a0growth engine.\n\nRegulation is a nudge. Japan has wasted no time embracing the higher capital requirements for banks now being imposed,\u00a0following the 2008 to 2009 global financial crisis. That is an incentive for the likes of Nomura to expand into \u201ccapital-light\u201d asset management.\n\nIn parallel, Japan is attempting to modernise its capital markets and investment industry, which has a bias towards domestic investment. The environment is conducive to Japanese financial firms importing investment expertise from abroad via mergers and acquisitions. Do not be surprised if there is more to follow.\n\nIf buying a foreign asset manager has logic, where and what? The US market\u2019s size and homogeneity make it an attractive destination for acquiring investment clients,\u00a0even if asset allocation is now shifting to Europe from the US. The remaining choice is whether to join the bidding frenzy in private assets or double down in public fund management, a buyer\u2019s market.\n\nBlackRock chief executive officer\u00a0Larry Fink can \u2013 probably \u2013 get away with high prices for private asset managers because his existing platform offers opportunities to grow his acquisitions. Chris Willcox, the former JPMorgan Chase exec who runs Nomura\u2019s wholesale and asset management unit, does not have that luxury. Bargain hunting for a conventional asset manager is therefore the\u00a0less risky course.\n\nIndeed, the Nomura-Macquarie deal underscores one compensating attraction of the active space despite the lack of growth:\u00a0its profitability. Nomura said the business acquired has a \u201chigh operating margin\u201d.\n\nGiants like BlackRock enjoy margins of 40 per cent, while London-listed Schroders\u2019 are around 20 per cent, according to Bloomberg data. Being based in Philadelphia rather than New York may help lower costs. While profits were not disclosed, the price, at 1 per cent of managed assets, does not seem excessive. Bloomberg Intelligence reckons it is cheap.\n\nSo this seems to be a low-risk\u00a0and not hugely strategic\u00a0purchase, whose main problem is growth rather than a messy integration. Nomura is reaching firmly for the shaft of the barbell. Much will depend on cross-selling the enlarged unit\u2019s products between the expanded\u00a0customer base. Good luck with that.\n\nThe next temptation will be to use this as\u00a0a platform for\u00a0the kind of pricey private capital deal Nomura sensibly chose not to do\u00a0on this occasion.

PHOTO: BT FILE\n\nFor\n\nyears, Singapore has been at the vanguard of technology and finance. Its strategic posture - pragmatic, forward-looking, and robust regulatory oversight \u2014 has earned it a reputation of a trusted global hub for capital, innovation, and business. Singaporeans themselves are not new to crypto.\n\nAs of 2023, 57 per cent of finance forward Singapore residents own cryptocurrencies. And, the future of Singapore sees crypto as an inevitable feature of their financial lives, with approximately 40 per cent of Gen Z and millennials holding crypto.\n\nAs the world charts the future of finance and digital assets, Singapore faces a new challenge: will it continue to lead, or risk falling behind?\n\nMajor Asian nations, including Singapore, and European economies historically outpaced the United States on providing clear rules for digital assets. While regulatory clarity is a mainstream catalyst for new technology, so is harnessing innovation as a strategic priority.\n\nThe US has now reversed course from apprehension to opportunity. The Trump Administration has elevated both AI and crypto as national priorities, appointing a dedicated leader in David Sacks to oversee this dual innovation strategy. Meanwhile, peer jurisdictions have adapted and are moving fast.\n\nHong Kong responded to market feedback with the ASPIRe Framework, aiming to attract global digital asset platforms with more flexible requirements than previously introduced.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThe UAE is cultivating a multi-regulator framework, allowing firms to choose between VARA, ADGM, and DIFC, with clear licensing regimes, regulatory labs, sovereign investment participation, and more.\n\nThe UK has committed to becoming a global hub for digital assets, laying out a comprehensive legal and regulatory roadmap for the future.\n\nThe global message is clear: this is a new era for crypto \u2014 one focused on enabling innovation, not stifling it.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nSGX\u2019s venture into crypto derivatives could give it an edge over other bourses\n\nTrump Media pushes forward with pivot to crypto, ETF plans\n\nBitcoin rallies 20% during market turmoil to diverge from tech\n\nSingapore\u2019s strong foundations\n\nSingapore is not starting from scratch. In many ways the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has led the way globally, both in framing regulation as well as facilitating innovative test-and-learn projects.\n\nSpecifically, Singapore:\n\nCreated a credible and respected licensing regime for digital assets and stablecoins;\n\nLaunched cutting-edge pilots like Project Guardian and Project Orchid;\n\nAttracted global founders through initiatives like the EDB\u2019s Global Founders Program, and hosts 1,220 onchain startups, with 640 receiving funding;\n\nMaintained its strength in foreign exchange (FX) and cross-border payment systems;\n\nSustained its status as a regional hub for financial institutions and technology companies.\n\nSingapore has already laid the right foundations to be a global hub for digital assets, with a reputation for regulatory clarity and institutional rigor. By recalibrating its posture toward retail access and crypto-native platforms, Singapore can build on this momentum \u2014 unlocking new capital, attracting top-tier talent, and reinforcing its leadership in financial innovation. By leaning in to crypto\u2019s potential, Singapore can turn cautious signals into a renewed mandate for innovation, capital, and global leadership.\n\nSingapore is a key node in the global financial system for foreign exchange, cross-border flows, and institutional capital. The inevitable evolution of finance \u2014 onchain capital formation, tokenised assets, programmable money \u2014 builds directly on Singapore\u2019s strengths.\n\nTo sustain its leadership, Singapore must view digital assets not only as a risk to contain, but certainly as a technology to harness. That means:\n\nRecognising that meaningful innovation requires embracing both blockchain infrastructure and the assets that power permissionless innovation;\n\nWelcoming full lifecycle engagement from global platforms, not just limited experiments;\n\nIncentivising commercial-scale use of blockchain in FX, asset management, and payment infrastructure.\n\nWhat Singapore can do next\n\n1. Launch a National Digital Asset Strategy and establish a digital asset working group\n\nJust as Singapore developed a National AI Strategy, the time is ripe for a National Digital Asset Strategy to coordinate efforts across regulators, agencies, and industry. This strategy should articulate a long-term vision that balances prudence with ambition, and frames digital assets as a pillar of Singapore\u2019s economic and innovation agenda.To execute on this vision, Singapore should convene a cross-ministerial Working Group with private sector participation.\n\n2. Sovereign funds should consider establishing strategic bitcoin positions\n\nBitcoin is increasingly viewed as a digital store of value - akin to digital gold. Countries like the US are exploring its strategic utility. A sovereign reserve \u2014 whether for monetary innovation, treasury diversification, or geopolitical relevance \u2014 would place Singapore at the forefront of this movement.\n\n3. Ease guardrails for onshore retail participation\n\nToday, Singapore\u2019s strict restrictions on retail participation and limited product offerings intended to address the risks of consumer harm make it hard for licensed entities to build competitive offerings. A more nuanced regime that enables responsible access and robust disclosures - such as staking, yield-bearing products, and growth-linked offerings - would allow Singaporean consumers and platforms to benefit from innovation safely.\n\nRestricting licensed actors from marketing blurs the line between regulated and unlicensed players \u2014 making it harder for consumers to distinguish safe platforms from risky or offshore alternatives. This is especially material in a world where digital scams and fraud are growing more prevalent. Singapore retail users should know which firms have met the standard of licensing by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.\n\n4. Double down on R&D and upskilling\n\nSingapore can lead in onchain FX settlement, tokenised fund distribution, and stablecoin-based trade finance \u2014 but only if the public and private sectors collaborate closely. Aligning MAS, EDB, and IMDA around commercialisation incentives would catalyse meaningful job creation and deepen local capacity.\n\nTo future-proof its workforce, Singapore should expand Skillsfuture pathways to include crypto and digital assets roles - particularly in security, compliance, and engineering. By actively supporting upskilling and certification in high-tech, high-growth sectors, Singapore can equip its talent base to lead. Singapore strengthening domestic capacity ensures Singaporeans are drivers - not spectators - in the economy of the future.\n\n5. Establish a RegLab for tokenisation, placing crypto-native players at the forefront\n\nCrypto-native firms have deep expertise in digital asset custody, trading and tokenisation but cannot contribute to tokenisation projects due to limited regulatory pathways outside of traditional capital markets licensing.  Building on the principals of MAS\u2019s fintech sandbox, a low-risk, Reglab environment, with a clear ramp to commercialisation for DPT licensed operators can accelerate creation of innovative and competitive financial products.\n\nEmerging industries move fast. Singapore got the hard parts right \u2014 regulatory clarity, institutional credibility, and a culture of excellence. But the current tone of caution risks becoming a self-imposed ceiling.\n\nAs global momentum around digital assets builds, Singapore has the opportunity to chart a bold course forward to retain its leadership in financial innovation.  Singapore has everything it needs to win - again. It\u2019s time to move from strength to strength and ensure the next decade of finance is built in the Lion City.\n\nThe writer is country director of Coinbase Singapore\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Apple assembled just over 40 million iPhones in India in the fiscal year through March 2025. It sells more than 60 million iPhones a year in the US.\n\nThe plans are the latest sign of Apple and its suppliers accelerating a pivot away from China, a process that began when harsh Covid lockdowns hurt production at its largest plant. Tariffs introduced by US President Donald Trump as well as Beijing-Washington tensions are prompting Apple to amplify that effort.\n\nApple representatives in India did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The\n\nFinancial Times\n\nreported earlier Apple\u2019s goal was to source all its US-sold iPhones from India by the end of 2026. Bloomberg News previously reported Apple\u2019s plan to increasingly prioritize iPhones from the India supply chain for its US customers.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company assembled US$22 billion worth of iPhones in India in the 12 months ended March, increasing production by nearly 60 per cent over the previous year, Bloomberg reported this month. Apple now makes 20 per cent, or one in five, of iPhones in the South Asian country, while China remains its biggest production base by far.\n\nThe bulk of India-made iPhones are assembled at Foxconn Technology Group\u2019s factory in southern India. Tata Group\u2019s electronics manufacturing arm, which bought Wistron Corp.\u2019s local business and runs Pegatron Corp\u2019s operations in India, is also a key supplier.

Apple\u2019s average India production and exports surged all through the fiscal year to March.\n\nThe Trump administration earlier this month exempted electronics goods including smartphones and computers from its reciprocal tariffs. That\u2019s good news for companies such as Apple, though the reprieve doesn\u2019t appear to extend to Trump\u2019s separate 20 per cent duty on China, applied to pressure Beijing to crack down on fentanyl.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nApple takes top spot for first-quarter smartphone sales, data shows\n\nApple was on brink of crisis before Trump tariff concession\n\nApple's iPhone 16 hits Indonesia stores after months long ban\n\nApple airlifts 600 tonnes of iPhones from India \u2018to beat\u2019 Trump tariffs: sources\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone cost could rise 90% if it\u2019s made in US: Bank of America report\n\nApple exported 1.5 trillion rupees in iPhones from India last year, minister says\n\nApple customers dash to stores to buy iPhones ahead of tariffs\n\nMore\n\nThis also means iPhones made in India won\u2019t attract any duties as of now. Barring the exceptions made Apr 11, Trump\u2019s cumulative levies on China remain at 145 per cent, and will likely force companies such as Apple to intensify their supply chain shift.\n\nApple now assembles its entire iPhone range in India, including the more expensive titanium Pro models. Its manufacturing success in the world\u2019s most populous nation is also helped by state subsidies tied to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s ambition to turn the country into a manufacturing hub.

He added that \u201ctargeted measures\u201d are the more effective way to support lower and middle-income households.\n\nBetter housing access\n\nOn housing affordability, he cited the PAP manifesto\u2019s promise to ensure a sustainable market and noted that the government has committed to roll out even more supply \u2013 not just to meet the needs of seniors, but also for singles and higher-income individuals.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nGE2025: Campaigning kicks into high gear following suspenseful Nomination Day\n\n\u201cIn the next term of government, we should expect more enhancements to our schemes, more reviews and implementation of changes to our housing policy,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked whether the housing market could be rocked by moves to broaden access, such as a higher income ceiling, Lee said demand- and supply-side measures would help ensure market stability.\n\n\u201cWhen we can do that, and we can roll out more supply, we should be able to responsibly make changes to housing access parameters,\u201d he said.\n\nThe government will have to be upfront about the timeline for changes. \u201cThere\u2019s no point changing the policy, but then not being able to deliver it on the ground.\u201d\n\nConstructive criticism\n\nOverall, Lee acknowledged that job security and cost of living are the big concerns on the ground, with inflation being imported into Singapore and putting pressure on families.\n\nWhen he visited Jurong West Hawker Centre on Thursday, many residents he spoke to cited job security as a concern, adding that they were worried about hiring freezes and the risk of retrenchment.\n\n\u201cThey see that things are slowing down, they see orders being cancelled,\u201d he said, noting that many companies are worried about the impact of the global trade war \u2013 especially those that serve US or China value chains.\n\nHe noted that Prime Minister Lawrence Wong has emphasised continuing support to help Singaporeans cope with the cost of living.\n\nLee described the government support measures unveiled thus far, such as the Assurance Package, being neither \u201cpiecemeal\u201d nor \u201csmall scale\u201d.\n\nIf elected at the May 3 polls, his team will speak up on policies related to these economic concerns and provide \u201cconstructive criticism\u201d.\n\nAsked about the PSP\u2019s call to debate Lee\u2019s team, he said that there are platforms during the election, including televised ones, for policy discussions.\n\n\u201cThere are also manifestos which we all can scrutinise, as well as local plans which all parties should have put out or be putting out,\u201d he said.\n\nMeasures on the ground\n\nSenior Parliamentary Secretary Shawn Huang, one of the other four PAP candidates on the West Coast-Jurong West GRC team, elaborated on the plans to aid residents.\n\nHe noted that rising costs have made daily essentials more expensive, and that his team wants to help those of the \u201csandwiched\u201d generation, saddled with care for both young and aged family members.\n\nThey also want to work with corporate partners and job-search companies and coaches to help residents with employment opportunities.\n\nCommunity support for seniors is another key focus, said Huang. One effort is to identify \u201cmicro jobs\u201d that they can do for a few hours daily, while spending time with their families and hobbies the rest of the day.\n\nThe PAP team also wants to focus more on skills-building for people with special needs, and working with companies to redesign jobs.\n\nFor more election coverage, visit our\n\nGE2025 microsite\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Singapore\n\nSingapore boosts support for Timor-Leste as it prepares to join Asean\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:36 PM\n\nEconomists upgrade 2025 outlook after\u00a0\nQ2 GDP turns out better than expected\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:02 PM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nDaily Debrief: What Happened Today (Jul 14)\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:30 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nSingapore GDP up 4.3% in Q2, well above market expectations amid US tariff pause\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:00 AM", "images": [{"image_url": null, "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/428210322013d39495d53a7d87372ff6b09cd7535ee1f55bfff5aa05e412ed6f?w=180&h=120&dpr=1&f=webp", "alt_text": "Speaking to reporters on Wednesday afternoon, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong explained the thinking behind the redeployments, noting that he moved DPM Gan Kim Yong to Punggol as it was \u201creally not easy to find a senior officeholder of a similar stature\u201d to take over from SM Teo Chee Hean."}]}

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG\n\n[HONG KONG] BYD\u2019s net income in the first quarter jumped to 9.15 billion yuan (S$1.7 billion), overtaking Tesla on another key metric and signalling a robust start to the year for China\u2019s No 1 selling car brand.\n\nShenzhen-based BYD\u2019s net income was higher than the 8.1 billion yuan projected by analysts. While the carmaker\u2019s sales of 170.36 billion yuan for the three months ended Mar 31 were up 36 per cent year on year, they fell short of analyst expectations. Tesla reported net income of US$409 million for its first quarter earlier this week, much lower than what the market had been looking for.\n\nConsidering the first three months of the year are generally the slowest for Chinese automakers, with the period containing the long Chinese New Year holiday, BYD looks set for a strong 2025. Its car sales for the quarter were just shy of one million units, putting the Chinese behemoth well on track to achieve full-year sales of 5.5 million, including 800,000 exports.\n\nAnalysts have said they expect little impact on BYD from US President Donald Trump\u2019s auto tariffs considering the company does not sell passenger cars in the US and has solid order prospects from high growth areas like South America and parts of South-east Asia. It is also building an EV factory in Hungary that\u2019s expected to begin production in late 2025.\n\nChinese automakers including BYD were front and centre at this week\u2019s Shanghai auto show, despite a strong turnout from European rivals such as Volkswagen and BMW. BYD prominently displayed its push into higher-priced vehicles that could yield fatter margins, from its luxury sport utility vehicle the Yangwang U8L to its concept Dynasty-D series and its concept Denza Z sports car.\n\nEarlier this week, BYD split its stock in a move to appeal to a broader number of investors, following the likes of Nvidia and Tesla. The company will distribute eight bonus shares for every 10 shares held and issue 12 capitalisation shares from reserves for every 10 shares issued. That could enable BYD to \u201ccater to a broader group of investors,\u201d Morgan Stanley analysts led by Tim Hsiao wrote in a note.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nAt Shanghai auto show, EV makers to grapple with autonomous-tech crackdown, launch Tesla \u2018killers\u2019\n\nDonald Trump has given BYD the edge over Tesla\n\nIndia says \u2018no\u2019 to BYD while wooing rival Tesla to invest\n\nBYD had flagged its higher-than-expected first-quarter numbers in a filing earlier this month, days after it touted a new EV battery system that can charge for 400 km in just five minutes. The new technology will be available in the Han L and the Tang L sport utility vehicle, which will start at 270,000 yuan and 280,000 yuan, respectively, and be sold from this month.\n\nThe Tang L was at the Shanghai auto show this week.

And it has\u00a0been poaching top talent from its biggest rivals,\u00a0Knight Frank and Savills.\n\nOffering larger\u00a0earnings packets more closely aligned to personal performance, Sotheby\u2019s has recruited over 50 selling agents in about\u00a0two years, including\u00a0Becky Fatemi, one of the highest-rated London brokers, according to Spear\u2019s 500, an annual industry ranking. At least 10 of those agents have been lured away from Knight Frank.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nTuesday, 12 pm\n\nProperty Insights\n\nGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nLast April, Knight Frank became the first major agency to tweak its pay structures in response to the talent war. It began offering London residential sales agents a\u00a0direct share of commission on deals,\u00a0instead of a bonus linked to their\u00a0performance as well as that of the business itself.\n\nEven so, earlier this year the company lost another two of its longest-serving agents to Sotheby\u2019s, which announced four new hires to expand the franchise\u2019s presence in the affluent southwestern neighbourhoods of Barnes and Richmond.\n\nThe agents \u2013 who had spent about\u00a050 years combined at Knight Frank \u2013 were given the choice between negotiating a salary or a minimum-pay guarantee, with the latter rising to roughly \u00a31 million annually for the\u00a0top performers, people with knowledge of Sotheby\u2019s pay model said, asking not to be identified discussing private information.\n\nKnight Frank\u2019s best brokers earn a similar amount, whether they advise on residential real estate or far pricier commercial deals, including the sale of skyscrapers, shopping malls and portfolios of warehouses worth billions. The agent with the highest share of the partnership\u2019s profits in 2024 took home about \u00a31.6 million, according to company accounts, which don\u2019t indicate which department that person worked for.\n\nSotheby\u2019s agents earn a net fee of 20 per cent on each deal, and once they hit \u00a3500,000 worth of fees in a year, that rate doubles to 40 per cent, according to the people. The company advised\u00a0on \u00a31.2 billion of property negotiations\u00a0in 2024, including some of the biggest transactions, and roughly quadrupled its year-on-year revenue in that time.\n\nA spokesperson for Sotheby\u2019s said in an emailed statement that it doesn\u2019t comment on individual pay terms but prides itself on offering the best brokerage package in the industry.\n\nAs it seeks to retain top talent during a market slump that has depressed company earnings, Knight Frank is considering how it can further evolve its pay changes. \u201cWe are working hard to make Knight Frank the very best place to have a career,\u201d residential head\u00a0Tim Hyatt said.\n\nSotheby\u2019s\u00a0compensation tactics arrived in London as the slowdown, driven by higher interest rates and tax changes, prompted some desperate sellers to offer discounts of as much as 30 per cent.\n\nResidential deals above \u00a35 million tumbled 23 per cent in the first three quarters of\u00a02024 from the same period a year earlier, and only one sale, brokered by Knight Frank and Beauchamp Estates,\u00a0surpassed \u00a3100 million. Sotheby\u2019s deals included O\u2019Brien\u2019s \u00a380 million west London mansion sale and a \u00a356 million Mayfair penthouse, the people said. O\u2019Brien declined to comment.\n\nFees at Sotheby\u2019s are split 50-50 between the agent who won the listing and the one who brought the buyer. And unlike traditional agents, there are no geographical restrictions on where brokers can do business. That has fuelled competition among those vying for commissions, the people said.\n\n\u201cOur focus has always been on delivering exceptional results through integrity, expertise, and trust,\u201d\u00a0Azar said in an emailed reply to questions. \u201cThat\u2019s why I personally handpick the agents who join our firm.\u201d\n\nThe former banker, who is based in Dubai and took over Sotheby\u2019s London property franchise in 2023, has approached so many top London agents that not receiving an offer is seen by some as a snub, the people said.\n\nOne senior agent said they were flown out to meet with Azar, but turned down a job proposal due to skepticism about the long-term prospects of the business model. The person speculated that some agents may view working for Sotheby\u2019s as a financial boost in a market slump and that they will return to \u00a0traditional brokers when activity is booming again.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for brokers to change jobs during a downturn and the prospect of signing minimum pay agreements that cover their first one to two years in a new role is attractive. However, the extent of Sotheby\u2019s raid on the city\u2019s incumbent firms has been a hot topic in the private members clubs of Mayfair, and not everyone is convinced by its New York-style brokerage culture.\n\n\u201cThe model that works in America doesn\u2019t necessarily work here,\u201d said Trevor Abrahmsohn, managing director of luxury real estate firm Glentree. \u201cDesperation for sales plays into the way you deal with things, when in reality, there\u2019s a coolness you need to build long-term success in this market.\u201d\n\nHe added,\u00a0\u201cIf the lights went out now, they would have made their mark, but the model is unsustainable.\u201d\u00a0BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM", "images": []}

His remarks triggered rounds of applause from the audience and were followed by equally impassioned remarks from his peers.\n\nA Fed spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe remarks followed President Donald Trump\u2019s renewed public ire for Powell in recent days. Earlier this week, Trump called Powell a \u201cmajor loser\u201d on social media and again pushed for the Fed to lower interest rates.\n\nThose comments \u2013 along with Trump\u2019s public musings about Powell\u2019s termination \u2013 sparked jitters on Wall Street, as investors fretted the central bank\u2019s independence could come under threat. The president subsequently said he had no intention of firing the Fed chief.\n\nThe Fed on Saturday will begin its customary quiet period ahead of policymakers\u2019 next meeting May 6-7. Officials are expected to hold rates steady at that gathering for the third consecutive time. Powell and other officials have expressed a willingness to keep policy on hold for now, in part to guard against the possibility that Trump\u2019s tariff policy could lead to persistent inflation.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nTrump\u2019s push against Powell is the latest reason to sell US assets\n\nPowell has consistently emphasized the importance of central bank independence, and has said Fed officials don\u2019t take politics into account when setting policy. In comments last week, Powell said he and his colleagues are not removable except \u201cfor cause.\u201d\n\nThe Fed\u2019s independence \u201cis very widely understood and supported in Washington, in Congress, where it really matters,\u201d Powell said on Apr 16 at the Economic Club of Chicago.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re never going to be influenced by any political pressure,\u201d he added at that event. \u201cPeople can say whatever they want. That\u2019s fine. That\u2019s not a problem.

However, Sanson scored again just 22 seconds into the second half, and Youssouf Ndayishimiye later headed in to make it 3-1.\n\n\u201cFor me the result is not fair but that\u2019s football, you have to accept it,\u201d said PSG coach Luis Enrique, who saw his side dominate the game with 76 percent possession and over 30 shots on goal.\n\nPSG had been unbeaten in 30 Ligue 1 matches this season, and had not lost any of their last 41 games against French opposition since a 3-1 home loss against Toulouse on May 12 last year.\n\nThe result means PSG, who had already secured a fourth consecutive Ligue 1 title at the start of this month, fall short of equalling the record for the longest unbeaten run from the beginning of a French season.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nFriday, 2 pm\n\nLifestyle\n\nOur picks of the latest dining, travel and leisure options to treat yourself.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThat record is still held by Nantes, who went undefeated for 32 matches before suffering their sole defeat on the way to winning the title in 1994/95.\n\nPSG must now quickly put this defeat behind them as they head to London for the first leg of their Champions League last-four tie against Arsenal on Tuesday, before the return at the Parc des Princes on May 7.\n\n\u201cNot worried\u201d\n\n\u201cThe possibility of beating a couple more records was an objective for us in these last few weeks,\u201d admitted Luis Enrique.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nMuddled Champions League format lessens the excitement levels\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t to be, but it does not in any way change our objective of carrying on in the Champions League and getting to the final.\u201d\n\nPSG had started with a full-strength line-up but were denied by a string of fine saves by Nice goalkeeper Marcin Bulka.\n\n\u201cWhat I saw, I would take that again in London on Tuesday and in the return leg,\u201d Luis Enrique added.\n\n\u201cI am not worried at all. When you have a team that doesn\u2019t speculate, that tries to attack, presses, doesn\u2019t stop running, but doesn\u2019t take their chances and the opposition goalkeeper makes some incredible saves, well that\u2019s football and I accept it.\u201d\n\nSanson marked his first start of the season after injury to put Nice ahead only for Ruiz to fire in from Ousmane Dembele\u2019s assist to equalise before the break.\n\nSanson then adjusted his body to finish superbly from a Jonathan Clauss cross immediately after the restart, and Ndayishimiye headed in a Badredine Bouanani free-kick with 20 minutes left.\n\nNice also beat PSG in Paris last season and held Luis Enrique\u2019s side to a 1-1 draw in the reverse fixture at the beginning of this campaign.\n\nThe victory is a huge boost to their chances of qualifying for next season\u2019s Champions League, as they climb up to fourth place and are behind Monaco in third only on goal difference. Marseille in second are only one point better off.\n\nThe top three teams in Ligue 1 qualify directly for the league phase of next season\u2019s Champions League, with fourth entering in the preliminary rounds.\n\n\u201cIt is quite an achievement to beat this PSG, with the season they are having, in their own ground,\u201d said Nice coach Franck Haise.

The companies\u2019 Hong Kong-listed stocks have dropped about 30 per cent each from March highs, shedding around US$70 billion in combined market value.\n\nInvestors are bracing for a prolonged struggle that will hurt earnings for the pair. Analysts have cut price targets for both stocks, and defensive positioning has ramped up in the options market.\n\n\u201cBoth sides are worse off in the near term, and it\u2019s unclear how long this battle will last,\u201d said Daisy Li, a fund manager at EFG Asset Management HK. The intense level of competition in the Chinese food-delivery market will damage profitability, she added.\n\nEven as US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs have taken steam out of the recent China tech rally, the impact of this domestic rivalry stands out. Meituan and JD.com rank among the worst eight performers on the Hang Seng Tech Index this year after both were in the top half in 2024.\n\nThe switch came as JD.com deployed a cash-burning strategy to promote its JD Takeaway food platform, which was officially launched in February. The Beijing-based company has announced over US$1.4 billion in discounts for consumers, waved commission fees for some merchants and aims to hire 100,000 full-time delivery riders.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nJPMorgan Chase estimates JD.com has taken about 5 per cent share of China\u2019s food delivery market, which was previously divided at about 75 per cent for Meituan and 25 per cent for Alibaba Group Holding\u2019s Ele.me.\n\nThe brokerage estimates that at the current scale, JD Takeaway could generate up to 18 billion yuan (S$3.2 billion) in annualised losses, wiping out 36 per cent of its parent\u2019s operating profit for 2025.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think this is a sustainable strategy because of the financial impact on group P&L,\u201d analyst Alex Yao wrote in a note on Tuesday (Apr 22). \u201cIt is cost prohibitive for a new entrant to gain significant market share in China\u2019s food delivery market through a deeply subsidised growth strategy.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nJD.com to add 100,000 delivery riders in China to take on Meituan\n\nChina\u2019s retail giants pledge to help exporters go domestic amid trade war\n\nJD.com sales rise most in years after China consumers awaken\n\nJD.com\u2019s food delivery foray unnerves investors as shares lag\n\nMore\n\nMeituan has successfully fended off food-delivery competition in the past, but JD.com is seen as a formidable challenger given its existing delivery network. At the same time, Meituan made inroads this year into JD.com\u2019s core quick-commerce field, computer and electronics products.\n\nWhile both firms are heavily reliant on Chinese consumption, Meituan has been spending aggressively on expansion into overseas food delivery through its Keeta app.\n\n\u201cJD doesn\u2019t have many growth opportunities left in China, and has very little overseas exposure,\u201d said Felix Wang, head of global technology & software at Hedgeye Risk Management. In this context, its costly JD Takeaway foray is more of a defensive move and \u201cnot entirely about food delivery\u201d.\n\nSell-side analysts have turned more cautious as the skirmish drags on. Though both stocks are overwhelmingly buy rated, the average price target for Meituan is down 8 per cent from a March high, and JD.com\u2019s has dipped about 4 per cent.\n\nThe costs of hedging against declines in both stocks remain far above their one-year averages. For JD.com, the ratio of outstanding bearish-to-bullish options has surged to its highest level since August, ranking among the most negatively skewed Hong Kong stocks.

Such steps could allow for faster deployment of low-cost credit for investment in targeted areas.\n\n\u201cWe must keep improving the policy toolbox to stabilise employment and the economy, and launch measures already planned at an earlier date,\u201d top leaders said, according to the readout. They also promised to \u201cgo all out to consolidate the fundamentals of economic development and social stability.\u201d\n\nBeijing is signalling it\u2019s in no rush to be aggressive in expanding economic stimulus just a month after unveiling measures including a commitment to run a record-high budget deficit. China\u2019s stronger-than-expected growth in the first quarter bought more time for the government to consider new steps.\n\n\u201cThe stimulus hope is still alive,\u201d said Zhaopeng Xing, senior strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. \u201cBut the leaders clearly adopt a wait-and-see approach.\u201d\n\nPolicymakers reiterated China should free more cash for banks \u201cwhen needed,\u201d and carefully \u201cpick the timing\u201d for rate cuts.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nFutures on 30-year government bonds jumped the most since Apr 9 after the Politburo\u2019s comments on timely rate and reserve requirement ratio cuts. The yield for 10-year notes stayed little changed and the offshore yuan was flat. China\u2019s onshore stock benchmark CSI 300 Index closed 0.1 per cent higher after an advance of as much as 0.5 per cent.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s Politburo on Friday sent a calmer message than the market expected \u2013 yes, emergency trade-war plans are being prepared to support the economy, but no, it\u2019s not an all-in moment,\u201d said Bloomberg Economics economists Eric Zhu and David Qu. \u201cThe meeting readout suggests the focus remains on executing the stimulus plan approved in early March \u2013 with faster delivery \u2013 and sticking to medium and long-term reform plans.\u201d\n\nBeijing has typically dispensed support only when warranted to protect the nation\u2019s annual growth goal. While expansion in the first quarter came in above the government\u2019s target of about five per cent for this year, more stimulus is still needed since the economy could lose momentum significantly from April, when Trump\u2019s punitive reciprocal tariffs kicked in.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nChina waives tariffs on some US goods, but denies Trump\u2019s claim that talks are underway\n\nChina\u2019s investments in South-east Asia snarl US plans on supply chains\n\nBeijing says claims of ongoing US-China trade talks \u2018groundless\u2019\n\nChina\u2019s central bank chief warns trade frictions threaten trust in world economy\n\nTrump considers reducing Chinese car part tariffs: FT\n\nBoeing ready to resell jets as tariffs hit China trade\n\nChinese exporters retreat from US as tariffs erode profitability\n\nChina says \u2018door open\u2019 to trade talks after Trump signals tariffs will fall\n\nTrump floats cutting China tariffs \u2018substantially\u2019 in trade deal\n\nMore\n\nThe authorities may inject more economic aid when they get a clearer view of the prospects for trade negotiations with the US, with the next huddle of the Politburo in three months\u2019 time a window to watch, according to Jacqueline Rong, chief China economist at BNP Paribas.\n\n\u201cPolicymakers will likely wait until the July Politburo meeting to unveil new stimulus,\u201d she said. \u201cBy then, two things will become clearer: how trade talks with the US will go and how the economy is faring with most of the policies approved at the Two Sessions having been rolled out,\u201d she said, referring to the annual legislative session.\n\nChina\u2019s leadership took stock of the economy one day after Beijing dismissed claims from the US that there were talks on reaching a trade deal. China\u2019s Commerce Ministry also re-upped its demand this week for Washington to revoke all unilateral tariffs, showing it\u2019s in no rush to start negotiations despite Trump\u2019s suggestion he could substantially lower levies in a deal.\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun reiterated on Friday that \u201cChina and the US are not having any consultation or negotiation on tariffs.\u201d Speaking at a daily press briefing, he said \u201cthe US should not mislead the public.\u201d\n\nDespite the hard-line rhetoric, Beijing is quietly considering suspending its 125 per cent retaliatory tariffs on some US imports, a move that will contain the fallout of the trade war on certain sectors. The pullback, mirroring similar moves on the part of Washington, reflects the extent to which the world\u2019s two biggest economies have become intertwined, with some key industries at risk of grinding to a halt after tensions escalated.\n\nSome of the pledges from the Politburo readout have been previously floated by senior officials, such as a \u201csci-tech board\u201d in the bond market and relending facilities for elderly care, as well as boosting service consumption. The meeting appears to be giving the tasks greater urgency after Trump hiked levies on most Chinese goods to as high as 145 per cent.\n\nThe authorities also reiterated they will forcefully push forward a programme to renovate urban villages and run-down homes while streamlining policies for local governments to buy unsold homes.\n\nThe measures are part of efforts to halt a years-long property slump by driving additional home-buying demand and easing the liquidity crunch experienced by many developers.\n\n\u201cChinese policymakers want to show preparedness for a prolonged trade conflicts and to give markets some confidence,\u201d said Woei Chen Ho, an economist at United Overseas Bank \u201cThe big picture is still on how to promote domestic demand and stabilise the property market.\u201d\n\nThe 24-member Politburo typically uses its huddles in April, July and December to discuss economic issues. While the readouts rarely reveal numerical targets, the vaguely worded statements can give important clues on policy shifts. This month\u2019s meeting is being closely watched for any signs of Beijing rolling out stimulus.\n\n\u201cWe must strengthen the bottom-line thinking and fully prepare contingency plans to concrete do well the economic work,\u201d top leader said in the meeting readout, adding that more work needed to be done to allow the economy to keep recovering.

Indonesia is facing a 32 per cent duty rate, while Malaysia is facing 24 per cent. However, the tariffs were put on hold for 90 days in early April to allow time for negotiations.\n\nMalaysia has expressed its willingness to enter into discussions with the US, focusing on four key areas: reducing the US trade deficit, easing non-tariff barriers, enhancing technological safeguards and security, and exploring the potential for a bilateral trade agreement.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s Minister of Investment, Trade and Industry Tengku Zafrul Aziz, in talks with US officials, has noted the US\u2019 declining trade deficit with Malaysia as a clear sign of positive progress.\n\nPHOTO: AFP\n\nMalaysia\u2019s Minister of Investment, Trade and Industry Tengku Zafrul Aziz and Second Finance Minister Amir Hamzah Azizan have been in Washington since Thursday, engaging in discussions with US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer.\n\n\u201cWe are looking to explore alternative solutions to address US concerns while ensuring the continued flow of mutually beneficial trade between Malaysia and the US,\u201d Tengku Zafrul said.\n\nMalaysia views the 90-day reprieve as a crucial opportunity for constructive engagement.\n\nThe country has reaffirmed its decision not to retaliate against Washington, underscoring its willingness to work together in addressing the raised concerns.\n\nEmphasising a decade of robust and increasingly balanced bilateral trade, Tengku Zafrul pointed to the US\u2019 declining trade deficit with Malaysia as a clear sign of positive progress. Discussions also touched on expanding US-Asean cooperation, especially as Malaysia holds the 2025 Asean chairmanship.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to keeping the momentum going and urgently addressing key issues within this 90-day window,\u201d he said. \u201cMalaysia remains open to ongoing discussions and is focused on achieving a mutually beneficial resolution to this tariff issue.\u201d\n\nDim growth outlook\n\nThe tariff retaliation tensions sparked by Trump\u2019s trade policies have led to a dimming of the economic growth outlook for countries, particularly those in Asia, which have direct trade links with both the US and China.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised\n\nMalaysia\u2019s real gross domestic product growth\n\nforecast for this year down to 4.1 per cent, a decrease from its January prediction of 4.7 per cent, reflecting a broader trend of lowered growth projections across the region.\n\nMeanwhile, Indonesia\u2019s Sri Mulyani, who is also in Washington for the IMF-World Bank meetings, warned that the spillover effects of reciprocal tariffs could hurt global economic growth, including Indonesia\u2019s.\n\nWhile exports to the US make up just about 2 per cent of Indonesia\u2019s GDP, the ripple effects of US tariffs on its trading partners are poised to have a much larger impact on the economy.\n\nShe cautioned that if the proposed 32 per cent tariffs are implemented, Indonesia\u2019s growth this year could be reduced by 0.3 to 0.5 percentage point, with the official growth target set at 5.2 per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

PHOTO: BT FILE\n\n[SINGAPORE] Analysts from DBS Group Research are mixed on some real estate investment trusts (Reits) this earnings season: They have kept their \u201cbuy\u201d rating on logistics-focused Mapletree Logistics Trust (MLT), but have downgraded Keppel Infrastructure Trust (KIT) to \u201chold\u201d.\n\nThis is amid widespread economic uncertainty \u2013 mainly from the recent US-China trade war \u2013 which risks ripple effects on their portfolios.\n\nThe target prices have been lowered to S$1.55 from S$1.75 for MLT, and to S$0.45 from S$0.57 for KIT.\n\nWhile\n\nMLT\u2019s Q4 distribution per unit (DPU) fell by 11.6 per cent to S$0.01955\n\n, DBS\u2019 Dale Lai and Derek Tan said that it was \u201cwell-anticipated by the market\u201d.\n\nThe analysts said in their Thursday (Apr 24) report that stripping out the Reit\u2019s divestment gains of S$27 million, compared with S$41.5 million from the year before, its core FY2025 DPU would have come in at S$0.07519, down 7.9 per cent year on year instead.\n\n\u201cThe drop was due to lower contribution from China, divested properties and general currency weakness against the Singapore dollar, mitigated by stronger performance from the Reit\u2019s Singapore, Australia and Hong Kong properties, coupled with acquisitions,\u201d they wrote.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nTuesday, 12 pm\n\nProperty Insights\n\nGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nAdditionally, the manager of the Reit also decided to hold back from distributing its past undistributed divestment gains, in light of the market uncertainty brought about by the US-China trade war. Its leverage remained stable, but was at the higher end of the historical range at 40.7 per cent.\n\nThis amounted to around S$19 million, which the analysts deemed a prudent move.\n\nThey noted that the trust\u2019s leverage ratio was affected by a year-end devaluation exercise, coupled with the manager taking on more debt for acquisitions.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nMapletree Logistics Trust\u2019s Q4 DPU falls 11.6%; manager warns trade tensions could weigh on performance\n\nKeppel Infrastructure Trust posts 27.7% higher Q1 distributable income of S$65 million ahead of GMG acquisition\n\nStill, the trade war raises business uncertainties and could affect prospects in the medium term, wrote the analysts. However, MLT\u2019s exposure being substantially insulated \u2013 with 85 per cent of its portfolio revenue from domestic demand \u2013 suggests minimal impact from the tariffs, they said.\n\nAt its current price, the Reit trades at a price-to-book ratio of 0.9 times and offers a yield of over 6 per cent, which is attractive, the analysts noted.\n\n\u201cIf interest rates ease, we expect stronger allocations into S-Reits (Singapore-listed Reits), especially those with defensive sector exposure,\u201d they added.\n\nMeanwhile, analyst Suvro Sarkar has a more \u201ccautious\u201d stance on KIT, citing the concerns over the stability of distribution income.\n\n\u201cFor a business trust like KIT, cash flows are expected to be predictable, and for a long time, they were \u2013 even during the Covid-19 period,\u201d he wrote in an Apr 23 note.\n\nHowever, since 2023, cash flow has been harder to predict and its timing has been less consistent, with one-offs and adjustments. This does not make for a great reading, he warned.\n\n\u201cDistribution income in both 2023 and 2024 came in lower than 2022 levels, and distributions in 2023 were shored up by proceeds from \u201ccapital optimisation\u201d (or debt refinancing) \u2013 a trend that is concerning,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn the company\u2019s Q1 business update released on Tuesday,\n\na loss of S$678,000 was noted for the distribution income\n\nunder the Philippine Coastal segment due to higher debt repayment of S$5.2 million. The trustee-manager noted that Q1 distributable income will fall by 31.9 per cent on the year to S$45.5 million after adjusting for one-offs as well.\n\nLooking ahead, higher-than-expected capital expenditure (capex) \u2013 of both maintenance and growth types \u2013 could again lead to volatility in distribution income.\n\nHe also noticed that while the trust\u2019s balance sheet presents no immediate concerns, it is \u201cmore stretched than before\u201d, with its gearing metrics above 40 per cent before the Philippine Coastal disposal, and are above the Monetary Authority of Singapore\u2019s guidelines for S-Reits.\n\n\u201cWe see limited further debt headroom for growth, and KIT may need to tap the equity market for any future transactions,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe question is \u2013 at current yields of around 10 per cent, can public equity markets be the reliable funding source KIT is looking for? And how will that affect the trust\u2019s ability to grow?\u201d he asks.\n\nTo Sarkar, though the trust is trading at a healthy yield, the weak share price performance in the year to date implies that KIT \u201cneeds to inspire more confidence\u201d in its ability to generate stable cash flows.\n\nAs at 1.10 pm on Friday, units of KIT were trading 1.2 per cent or S$0.005 down at S$0.40. Units of MLT were trading 4.1 per cent or S$0.05 lower at S$1.16.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\n[LONDON] A 25 per cent US tariff on pharmaceutical imports would increase US drug costs by nearly US$51 billion annually, boosting US prices by as much as 12.9 per cent if passed on, a report commissioned by the industry\u2019s US trade group and reviewed by Reuters shows.\n\nThe analysis, conducted by Ernst & Young, found the US imported US$203 billion in pharmaceutical products in 2023, with 73 per cent coming from Europe \u2013 primarily Ireland, Germany and Switzerland. Total US sales of finished pharmaceuticals that year were US$393 billion.\n\nThe report, dated Apr 22 and not made public, was commissioned by the main US pharmaceutical lobby, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, whose members include Amgen, Bristol Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, and Pfizer, among others.\n\nPhRMA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The group has argued tariffs would undermine efforts to boost domestic manufacturing, a goal of US President Donald Trump.\n\nPharmaceutical products have long been spared from trade wars due to the potential harms, but he has repeatedly threatened a 25 per cent tariff on pharmaceutical imports.\n\nLast week, the Trump administration announced probes into pharmaceutical imports, citing national security concerns over reliance on foreign drug production.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThe move triggered a 21-day public comment period as part of the investigation led by the Commerce Department.\n\nDrugmakers see the probe as a chance to show the administration that high tariffs would hinder their efforts to swiftly ramp up US production, and to propose alternatives, said Ted Murphy, a trade lawyer at law firm Sidley Austin, which is advising companies on their submissions to the Commerce Department.\n\nDrugmakers have also lobbied Trump to phase in tariffs on imported pharmaceutical products in hopes of reducing the sting from the charges.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nRoche to invest US$50 billion in US to avoid Trump tariffs, create 12,000 jobs\n\nUS steps up probes into pharmaceutical, chip imports, setting stage for tariffs\n\nNovartis pledges US$23 billion US investment as tariffs loom\n\nTrump says long-promised pharmaceutical tariffs due very shortly\n\nMore\n\nOn Thursday (Apr 24), Swiss drugmaker Roche said it is petitioning the US government in direct talks for import tariff exemptions, arguing the products it ships into the US are offset by its exports of US-made drugs and diagnostics.\n\nProduction costs are only one factor shaping the price of newer medicines and it is unclear to what extent tariffs on imported intermediate inputs or imported finished products would be passed forward to consumers, the report said.\n\nTariffs on imported finished products could be passed through to consumers by the wholesale or retail distributors paying the tariff.\n\nBut if duties were fully passed on through higher prices on domestic sales, EY estimates US drug prices could rise up to 12.9 per cent.\n\nApproximately 30 per cent of pharmaceutical imports in 2023 were ingredients used in US manufacturing and then exported or sold in the US.\n\nTariffs on these would raise domestic production costs by 4.1 per cent and reduce the global competitiveness of US-made drugs, the report said.\n\nRoughly 25 per cent of US pharmaceutical output is exported, which totalled US$101 billion in 2023. EY said a portion of the 490,000 export-related jobs in the industry could be at risk if higher input costs weaken foreign demand for US medicines.\n\nThe report did not include the impact of possible retaliatory tariffs. The economic impact of those for US producers would be much more significant.

These tariffs have been put on hold for 90 days.\n\n\u201cIn the negotiation process, Indonesia prioritises national interests while encouraging the strengthening of bilateral relations with US,\u201d he said at an online press conference.\n\nLast year, Indonesia reported a US$14.3 billion trade surplus with the US.\n\nThe minister refrained from sharing specific details about the negotiations but said that the discussions included energy supply, US market access for Indonesian goods, deregulation in Indonesia, and critical mineral and technology sharing for agriculture, healthcare and renewable sectors.\n\nThe two countries also discussed Indonesia\u2019s national payment system and QR code standards, which the US has stated is a barrier for its payments companies. Airlangga indicated that Indonesia is open to foreign operators such as US firms Visa and Mastercard.

She added that Washington has asked members of the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean) about their response as a bloc to US trade policy.\n\nThe Indonesian delegation has met with top US officials and business people in sectors such as semiconductors, as well as executives from companies such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Boeing.\n\nOn Thursday, Sri Mulyani warned that US tariffs and their impact on global economic growth could hurt Indonesia\u2019s economic expansion. However, she expects a steady 5 per cent growth this year, only slightly below the government\u2019s 5.2 per cent target.

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\n[NEW YORK] China\u2019s central bank is boosting cash injection via one of its policy tools as it seeks to safeguard the world\u2019s second-largest economy from the impact of punitive US tariffs.\n\nThe People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) will conduct 600 billion yuan (S$108 billion) of one-year medium-term lending (MLF) facility on Friday (Apr 25) to maintain ample liquidity in the banking system, it said on Thursday. This will result in a net cash injection of 500 billion yuan via this tool in April, the largest since December 2023, according to Bloomberg calculations.\n\n\u201cThe operation unleashes a signal of supportive monetary policy stance\u201d as the economy embraces challenges in the trade environment, said Wang Qing, chief macro analyst at Golden Credit Rating. \u201cThis is also to ensure liquidity conditions remain ample when the government\u2019s fundraising via special government debt issuances gathers pace.\u201d\n\nInvestors have been calling for further policy easing from the PBOC with the economy facing headwinds from US tariffs as high as 145 per cent. The latest bout of liquidity injection can help smooth over increased demand for cash during holidays in early May while supporting the issuance of special government bonds which kicked off this week.\n\nThe PBOC revamped its method for pricing the MLF last month, to allow banks to bid for the loan at different prices. The central bank has stopped releasing the cost of the one-year loans as it overhauls its rate system to prioritise short-term rates, as it seeks to implement a moderately loose monetary policy to support the economy.\n\nThe increase in cash injection via MLF was unexpected as the central bank has been downplaying the role of this tool for months, while replacing some of the maturing MLF with three- or six-month outright reverse repurchase agreements.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nChina\u2019s central bank chief warns trade frictions threaten trust in world economy\n\nChina kicks off special bond sale as tariffs threaten economy\n\nChina keeps lending rates steady; trade war raises bets for stimulus\n\nChina credit expansion beats forecast on bond sale deluge\n\nMore\n\nThis month 1.7 trillion yuan of outright reverse repurchase agreements come due, the largest monthly maturity since the central bank launched the liquidity instrument in October, according to Bloomberg calculations. The central bank is expected to announce its April operation for the tool at month-end.\n\n\u201cA larger injection through MLF may offset the maturity pressure of outright reverse repos this month,\u201d said Ming Ming, chief economist at Citic Securities.\n\nIt may also reduce the urgency for a reduction in banks\u2019 reserve requirement ratio, he said, adding that \u201cwhile the policy significance of MLF has decreased, it remains a useful tool for the PBOC to inject longer-term liquidity\u201d.

PHOTO: AFP\n\nDavid Fickling\n\nPublished Fri, Apr 25, 2025 \u00b7 05:00 PM\n\nWithout\n\nnoticing it, humanity has passed a remarkable milestone: alcohol\u00a0consumption has gone into possibly permanent decline.\n\nThat\u2019s a turning point in a habit at least as old as\u00a0civilisation itself. For millennia, we\u2019ve used drinking to loosen our inhibitions at social gatherings, anaesthetise ourselves from the drudgery of life, or simply give a little sparkle to our days.\n\nThe fact that we\u2019re giving it up without even noticing is a sign of how other longstanding practices \u2013\u00a0from smoking and\u00a0sexual promiscuity\u00a0to eating red meat\u00a0\u2013\u00a0might dwindle just as painlessly.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know whether an activity is truly going out of fashion\u00a0until years after the fact. Shifts in our consumption can be mysterious, and hard to predict. As any hiker would recognise, it can be all too easy to think you\u2019re at the peak long before you actually get there.\n\nSuch transitions do happen, however. Production of\u00a0grape wine\u00a0hit its maximum level of 37.5 million tonnes \u2013 equivalent to about 50 billion bottles \u2013 as far back as 1979, and has since fallen by about 27 per cent. Decades\u00a0of advocacy for the claimed health benefits of a daily glass of shiraz have failed to turn that picture around.\n\nWe appear to have hit a shallower peak in beer, too. The world is now about 2.6 per cent below where it was in 2016, when 190 million tonnes was brewed, or roughly half a trillion standard bottles.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nFriday, 2 pm\n\nLifestyle\n\nOur picks of the latest dining, travel and leisure options to treat yourself.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nTake in spirits and other alcoholic drinks\u00a0and the picture is even more sober. The IWSR, a London-based market research firm for the global beverage industry, has witnessed a dramatic fall in per-capita drinking in recent years, from 5 litres\u00a0of pure alcohol per adult\u00a0per year in 2013, to 3.9 litres in 2023. Plug demographic data into those numbers, and it looks like our thirst peaked in 2016 at 25.4 billion litres, from where it\u2019s fallen about 13 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe story has been one of progressive moderation at a macro level for a very, very long time,\u201d says Richard Halstead, head of consumer insights at the IWSR. \u201cYou have a generational shift going on between older consumers who drank relatively cheap stuff habitually with meals, and people in their 20s\u00a0and 30s who are very much event-driven.\u201d\n\nMore recent developments have accelerated those trends. The greater diversity of non-alcoholic alternatives and the increasing availability of marijuana and other soft drugs\u00a0have made it easier for people to abstain. The Covid-19 pandemic pushed things still further, focusing attention on health and encouraging a style of socialising\u00a0that\u2019s more intentional and less focused on just getting drunk.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nWine consumption falls heavily into the red\n\nThe great hope of every vice that appears to be peaking is demographics. The world\u2019s population just recently crossed eight billion, but it won\u2019t reach\u00a0a ceiling until it\u00a0hits around 10.3 billion in the 2080s, according to the United Nations. In theory, that should provide an ample supply of new drinkers.\n\nThat may be an over-optimistic assumption, though, because the hardest-drinking parts of the world\u00a0have already had\u00a0their demographic booms.\n\nMap out the region from Africa to South-east Asia that will account\u00a0for almost all population growth over the rest of this century, and you\u2019re looking at a picture of the larger Muslim world (that includes places like India and Nigeria, home to some of the largest Muslim populations). This is unlikely to be a strong market for the world\u2019s brewers, even as rising incomes give locals more opportunities to slake their thirsts.\n\nIn India, even non-Muslim religious groups\u00a0often abstain, while a longstanding temperance movement means alcohol consumption is banned altogether in several states. Some of the fastest-growing Christian sects in developing countries\u00a0are also non-drinkers, such as the Latter-Day Saints and Seventh-Day Adventists.\n\nPut all that together, and it\u2019s not hard to argue that we\u2019ve already passed peak booze. Should long-term alcohol consumption fall ultimately to 3.1 litres per adult per year, then the world will never again regain the 25.4-billion-litre level we hit in 2015. That\u2019s not at all implausible: it\u2019s\u00a0equivalent to roughly six standard drinks per adult\u00a0per week, or significantly more\u00a0when you consider that billions of teetotallers\u00a0are factored into the raw average.\n\nThat will represent a monumental moment for humanity, whose rise\u00a0has been intertwined with booze since deep in prehistory. The earliest evidence of alcohol consumption comes from the Raqefet Cave in Israel, where the Paleolithic Natufian culture left remnants of fermented grains\u00a0about 13,000 years ago.\n\nThe Natufians\u2019 habit of collecting and eating wild grass seeds may have been a crucial step in the domestication of cereal crops, allowing humanity to settle in cities for the first time. That suggests\u00a0civilisation itself could be a by-product of beer consumption, rather than the other way around.\n\nSince then, drinking is likely to have grown almost every year, in line with the human population. The only real exceptions would be\u00a0periods like the medieval plagues, when the sheer death toll may have been sufficient to reverse the unstoppable forward stagger of alcohol.\n\nHitting this turning point may seem like grim news for the world\u2019s drinks companies, but there\u2019s a silver lining. Consider the way microbreweries, boutique distilleries and dimly lit bars have proliferated in recent decades, where people think nothing of paying more for a cocktail than they would for a square meal.\n\nAs we consume fewer units of alcohol, we may still spend more on it, upgrading our habits to more premium liquors to match our wealthier lifestyles. The world may be sobering up \u2013\u00a0but it\u2019s not abandoning the bottle, just yet.

invested millions in Ng\u2019s billion-dollar nickel trading scheme.\n\nGoh, chief executive of lifestyle products retailer Ossia International, told the High Court on Apr 24 that he invested more than S$20 million in Ng\u2019s Envy companies from 2018 until Ng was arrested in 2021.\n\nGoh got back about S$10 million and lost about S$11 million, he said through a Mandarin interpreter.\n\nHe was testifying in Ng\u2019s ongoing criminal trial for 42 charges of cheating, forgery, criminal breach of trust, money laundering and fraudulent trading.\n\nThe 37-year-old is accused of masterminding a scam which attracted S$1.46 billion from 947 investors over six years.\n\nOver the past two weeks, the court has heard evidence of Ng\u2019s lavish purchases, which the prosecution alleges were funded

had bought the car directly from the Italian manufacturer and it was the only one in Singapore, he added.\n\nNg paid Goh a total of S$7.1 million for the car between March and August 2020.\n\nGoh said that for one of the payments, Ng deposited only S$800,000 when he was supposed to pay S$1 million. \u201cI told him it\u2019s all right, you deposit the remaining S$200,000 as an investment for me.\u201d\n\nThe S$200,000 was invested in Envy Global Trading, the court was told.\n\nUnder cross-examination by Nicholas Narayanan, one of Ng\u2019s lawyers, Goh could not recall when he bought the car, but said he paid \u201ca few million dollars\u201d for it.\n\nWhen asked, Goh said he had sold the car to Ng at a higher price than the price he had paid, but that it was \u201cnormal\u201d, and he agreed with the defence lawyer that the car had tremendous value that appreciates over time.\n\nNarayanan asked Goh if he knew Ng had tried to become the distributor for Pagani for the Singapore and Malaysia market, but the businessman said he did not know about this.\n\nThe trial continues.\n\nNg\u2019s nickel scheme was first offered through Envy Asset Management in February 2016.\n\nAfter the firm was placed on the Monetary Authority of Singapore\u2019s investor alert list, the scheme was moved to Envy Global Trading from Apr 2020 to March 2021.\n\nNg allegedly told investors he could buy nickel at a discount and then sell the metal for profit.\n\nThe prosecution\u2019s case is that the purported nickel trades did not exist, and that earlier investors were paid with money put in by other investors.\n\nTHE STRAITS TIMES\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Singapore\n\nSingapore boosts support for Timor-Leste as it prepares to join

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\n[TOKYO] Seven & i Holdings\u2019 new chief executive officer plans to boost investments in its US stores using cash from a planned listing of its American retail operations.\n\n\u201cThe initial public offering gives us the financial flexibility to invest a bit more aggressively in our stores,\u201d Stephen Dacus, who was named to the leadership position last month, said on Friday (Apr 25).\n\nThe Japanese operator of 7-Eleven convenience stores is in the middle of a restructuring to boost growth and shareholder value after years of weak investor returns made it the target of activist shareholders, as well as Canada\u2019s Alimentation Couche-Tard, which proposed to buy the company last year.\n\nThe overhaul includes a plan to list the US stores business next year, besides revamping its board, selling under-performing superstore business, divesting its banking unit, and undertaking about two trillion yen (S$18 billion) worth share buyback to 2030.\n\nThe company has about 1,000 stores with quick service restaurants in the US that outperform normal stores by quite a lot in terms of sales and profit, Dacus said. \u201cWe would like to expand that as rapidly as we can,\u201d he said, specifying that there are another 1,200 stores that could add QSR.\n\nSeven & i operates more than 13,000 convenience stores in North America, making it larger than its next three competitors \u2013 Couche-Tard, Casey\u2019s General Stores and Murphy USA, combined.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nDespite the raft of measures to turn things around, the Japanese retailer\u2019s stock has remained under pressure after a management buyout effort designed to challenge Couche-Tard\u2019s offer failed. Seven & i is valued at roughly around 5.5 trillion yen, lower than Couche-Tard\u2019s 7.39 trillion yen offer.\n\nIn addition to investing in its North America operations, Dacus is also looking to review the company\u2019s supply chain globally, especially at a time when consumers in the world\u2019s largest economy are becoming more conservative amid US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on imports.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a global supply strategy, even though we may have the same suppliers around the world for many things,\u201d Dacus said. \u201cAs a consequence, we are missing an opportunity.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nJapan\u2019s Seven & i seen booking 24% fall in Q4 profit, adding to takeover pressure\n\nCouche-Tard sees strong interest in US stores for Seven & I deal\n\nCouche-Tard met Seven & i investors to press case for takeover\n\nCouche-Tard says ready to boost bid if Seven & i engages\n\nMore\n\nThe shift in consumer behaviour reinforces the need for the company to move with speed and discipline to deliver greater value to customers, Dacus added.\n\nThere\u2019s a need to \u201csqueeze your costs really tightly,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to do everything you can to make your customers happy.\u201d BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Consumer & Healthcare\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nChina biotech\u2019s stunning advance is changing the world\u2019s drug pipeline\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nWith medical costs under the microscope, IHH Healthcare group CEO continues to eye expansion\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\nJul 13, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nKraft Heinz explores grocery business spinoff worth up to US$20 billion: source\n\nJul 12, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM\n\nEven 190% tariffs can\u2019t shake US shoemaker\u2019s reliance on China\n\nJul 11, 2025 11:31 AM\n\nLevi sees revenue growth offsetting most of tariff impact\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:15 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/413d12b4e3eb4d46c10c19aad902aa1585b558a553b0a667aed961780471304e?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "FILE PHOTO: Japan's Seven & I\u2019s logo is seen at its 7-Eleven convenience store in Tokyo, Japan August 19,  2024.

Scroll to the end of this article to find out more.\n\nMeanwhile, here is a party-by-party breakdown of the main developments on Day 3 of the nine-day campaign:\n\nPeople\u2019s Action Party (PAP)\n\nAljunied GRC:\n\nOn a walkabout with the PAP\u2019s Aljunied team, Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean stressed: \u201cWe don\u2019t give up any constituency.\u201d\n\nThe PAP fields candidates in every constituency, to give every voter a choice, he said.\n\nIts Aljunied team comprises Chan Hui Yuh, who also ran there in the 2020 General Election (GE), and four newcomers \u2013 Faisal Abdul Aziz, Adrian Ang, Daniel Liu and Jagathishwaran Rajo. They face the incumbent Workers\u2019 Party (WP) team led by party chief Pritam Singh and party chair Sylvia Lim.\n\nChua Chu Kang GRC:\n\nOn a walkabout in Teck Whye, Minister of Manpower Tan See Leng responded to\n\nProgress Singapore Party (PSP) chief Leong Mun Wai\u2019s comments\n\nat Thursday\u2019s rally, including that the PAP has seen a\u00a0\u201cgeneral decline in standards, in accountability, competence and ethics in recent years\u201d.\n\nDr Tan said that the PAP government has never \u201clost its way\u201d, and that the PSP should consider all the policies that have been introduced and refined to benefit Singaporeans.\n\nAs for the PSP\u2019s calls for a minimum wage, Dr Tan said the existing Progressive Wage Model is \u201cmore targeted, more differentiated, more precise\u201d.\n\nKebun Baru SMC:\n\nCandidate Henry Kwek launched the ward\u2019s manifesto, \u201cAlways on Your Side\u201d, outlining planned improvements to transportation networks and senior-friendly amenities.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nAt the launch, Kwek said that PAP backbenchers have a \u201cdirect line\u201d to ministers, and can be the first to bring up any gaps \u2013 whether in policy or meeting residents\u2019 needs \u2013 to the government.\n\nEarlier that day, WP chief Singh had asked voters to\n\ncompare the party\u2019s candidates with PAP backbenchers\n\n, rather than with political office-holders.\n\nMarsiling-Yew Tee GRC:\n\nOn a walkabout with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, fellow candidate Alex Yam said that the PAP\u2019s margin of victory will not affect how it delivers on its promises.\n\nHe was responding to Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) candidate Ariffin Sha, who said in\n\nThursday\u2019s rally\n\nthat the PAP would work harder if its margin of victory narrows in this election.\n\nWest Coast-Jurong West GRC:\n\nAt a media briefing in Boon Lay, National Development Minister Desmond Lee said that the government needs to be able to fund its programmes \u201cresponsibly and sustainably\u201d, in response to the PSP\u2019s call to revert the goods and services tax rate to 7 per cent.\n\nThe government must ensure it has sufficient resources to support Singaporeans through the challenges that come with a \u201cchanging global order\u201d, he said.\n\nWorkers\u2019 Party\n\nEast Coast GRC:\n\nThe PAP and WP teams for East Coast GRC crossed paths in a walkabout at Bedok 85 Market, with PAP anchor minister Edwin Tong shaking hands with WP team lead Yee Jenn Jong.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nGE2025: Singapore can return to \u2018the road to democracy\u2019 started in 2011: SDP\u2019s Paul Tambyah\n\nGE2025: With MNCs wavering on whether to stay, Singapore needs a good team: PM Wong\n\nGE2025: \u2018Real pressure\u2019 on PAP to act with opposition in Parliament, says WP\u2019s Pritam Singh\n\nAlso with the WP team was party chief Singh, who told reporters that\n\nvoters should measure WP\u2019s slate against PAP\u2019s backbenchers\n\n, rather than against ministers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s backbencher versus backbencher, because the WP is not going to be in government,\u201d he said, in response to PM Wong\u2019s rally comment that voters should hold the WP to the same standards as the PAP.\n\nSengkang GRC:\n\nIncumbent Member of Parliament Louis Chua took to Instagram to thank supporters for attending Thursday night\u2019s rally at Anchorvale Crescent.\n\n\u201cOther than the passion and conviction of my fellow WP colleagues, what touched me the most was the strong show of support by Singaporeans of all ages\u2026 who came all the way down to the rally despite a livestream made available, undaunted by the crowds and the muddy fields, and patiently helping each other throughout the whole session,\u201d he said in\n\nhis post\n\n.\n\nTampines GRC\n\n: Three members of the WP\u2019s slate \u2013 Faisal Manap, Jimmy Tan and Ong Lue Ping \u2013 discussed the Group Representation Constituency\u2019s four-cornered fight on\n\nThe Straits Times\u2019\n\ndaily show on the general election\n\n.\n\nFaisal said his \u201cheart was at peace\u201d when deciding to leave Aljunied GRC to contest Tampines GRC, after the WP received many requests from Tampines residents to run there.\n\n\u201cYes, there are other opposition parties contesting the constituency, but giving people a choice is part and parcel of a democratic society,\u201d he added.\n\nSingapore Democratic Party\n\nBukit Panjang SMC:\n\nOn Facebook, SDP candidate\n\nPaul Tambyah posted about crossing paths with PAP candidate Liang Eng Hwa\n\nthat afternoon, writing: \u201cWe had an unexpected but pleasant encounter.\u201d\n\nSembawang GRC\n\n: SDP\u2019s Gigene Wong handed out flyers at the Woodlands MRT station, while\n\nNational Solidarity Party (NSP) candidates\n\nengaged with residents at Woodlands North Plaza.

They face a PAP team comprising Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office Indranee Rajah, Desmond Tan, Sharael Taha and Valerie Lee.\n\nSingapore People\u2019s Party (SPP)\n\nPotong Pasir SMC:\n\nAt a coffee shop in Potong Pasir, party treasurer Williiamson Lee told reporters that he believes his chances in GE2025 are better than in GE2020, noting that he has covered most of Bidadari estate.\n\nIn GE2020, Williiamson Lee was part of the SPP\u2019s Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC team, which took 32.77 per cent of the vote.\n\nThis year, in a three-cornered fight for Potong Pasir SMC, he faces Alex Yeo of the PAP \u2013 who replaces three-term incumbent Sitoh Yin Pin \u2013 and People\u2019s Alliance for Reform chief Lim Tean.\n\nIn contrast to the first night\u2019s five rallies, tonight\u2019s sole rally is by SDP at Beacon Primary School for the Bukit Panjang SMC seat where party chairman\n\nTambyah faces PAP incumbent Liang\n\n.\n\nInstead, this evening features the first of two party political broadcasts, delivered on national television and radio at 8 pm. The second round will be on May 1, the last day of campaigning.\n\nThough 11 parties and two independents are participating in this general election, only eight parties have been given slots for the broadcasts.

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\n[TOKYO] Japan intends to push back against any US effort to bring it into an economic bloc aligned against China because of the importance of Tokyo\u2019s trade ties with Beijing, according to current and former Japanese government officials.\n\nLike many other countries, Japan is trying to get permanent relief from US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs by addressing US concerns in areas of bilateral trade, including automobiles and agriculture. The officials, who asked not to be identified, said that Japan is pushing to strike a deal before the current 90-day reprieve in tariffs expires, with one person saying the country hopes to finalise an agreement around the Group of Seven summit in June.\n\nAt the same time, the officials said Japan does not want to get caught up in any US effort to maximise trade pressure on China by curbing its own economic interaction with Beijing, which is Tokyo\u2019s biggest trading partner and an important source of goods and raw materials.\n\nAlthough the US has not made any specific requests to Japan regarding China, Tokyo would prioritise its own interests if that occurs, Japanese officials say. One of the officials added that Japan has conveyed to China on multiple occasions that it does not fully align with the US on chip-related exports and semiconductor restrictions.\n\nJapan\u2019s Foreign Ministry did not immediately provide comment upon a request by Bloomberg.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is playing a leading role in trade talks with Japan and other nations, said earlier this month that the US would seek to reach agreements with allies and \u201cthen we can approach China as a group\u201d. Bloomberg subsequently reported that the US is preparing to ask countries seeking tariff relief to reduce economic ties to China in a move to strengthen US leverage over Beijing as it tries to win concessions on trade.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\n\u2018Resolutely opposes\u2019\n\nJapan\u2019s lead trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, is scheduled to return to Washington for a second round of talks with US officials soon. On Monday (Apr 21), President Xi Jinping\u2019s government warned countries against striking deals with the US that also target Beijing, saying it \u201cresolutely opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of China\u2019s interests\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe need to be very careful about economic security issues and the supply chain involving China,\u201d Kono Taro, a lawmaker in Japan\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic Party and former foreign minister, said on Wednesday.\n\nRather than dialling back trade, Tokyo is in the process of trying to get China to resume imports of seafood and beef from Japan after bans imposed over health concerns.

Afterward, Saito said that both sides agreed to support the multilateral trading system and independently push the Trump administration to ease tariffs.\n\nIn a sign of Japan\u2019s commitment to the China market, Toyota Motor this week agreed to open a new factory in Shanghai in 2027, with the company reportedly planning to invest around US$2 billion in the plant.\n\nMore pessimistic\n\nAround 20 per cent of Japan\u2019s total commerce is with China, larger than its trade with the US. However, the US overtook China as an export destination for Japan in 2023, extending that lead last year. Japanese firms have become more pessimistic on the opportunities in China, with many cutting back investments as their revenue falls due to the weak Chinese economy and other factors.\n\nJapanese manufacturing was hit hard when China restricted the export of rare earths to Japan in 2010 amid a political dispute. After that, Japanese industry and government made a concerted push to diversify supply, investing in Australia and elsewhere to reduce some of their reliance on China.\n\nJapan is wary of similar restrictions after Beijing earlier this month added seven rare earths to its export control list in response to punitive tariffs imposed by Washington. Saito said he asked Chinese officials to make the \u201ccorrect decisions\u201d with regards to the handling of rare earths.\n\nJapan needs to walk a tightrope over US-China relations because it also leans heavily on the US as it sole formal security ally. The largest overseas US military troop presence is based in Japan, and Trump has in recent days resumed his long-standing demand for Tokyo to pay more for US military bases.\n\nBut any demands from Washington on Tokyo to downgrade its economic relationship with China would potentially deal Japan a major economic blow.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be really, really bad for Japan if it sees a drop in trade both with the US and China,\u201d said Yu Uchiyama, a professor of political science at the University of Tokyo. \u201cIf policymakers say let\u2019s abandon China, business people will of course oppose it.\u201d BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in International\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:54 PM\n\nSuspended Thailand PM Paetongtarn hit by ethics investigation, source and media say\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:07 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/3d780fbf82018095333f0d350c512d384375115c0e535eefc127b0d844eb4c99?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: A man in a bicycle drives past containers at an industrial port in Tokyo, Japan, May 22, 2019.

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG\n\n[NEW YORK] Chinese investments in South-east Asian manufacturing are likely much higher than official data shows, underscoring the difficulty of any US attempt to box in Beijing or exclude Chinese-made goods from its supply chains.\n\nLast year, there was US$10 billion of announced greenfield manufacturing investment by Chinese firms in the 10 members of the Association of South-east Asian Nations bloc, according to a report released on Thursday (Apr 24) by US research company Rhodium Group. That was down from the record US$12 billion of new projects in 2023.\n\nThe Rhodium figure for 2023 was about double the official tally from the Asean Secretariat, which recorded just over US$6 billion in inflows from China into manufacturing in the same year, the last for which data is available. There was an additional US$7 billion in investments from Hong Kong and almost US$7 billion from Singapore that year, the data showed.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not possible to see from the official data the origin of that money, it\u2019s likely that the majority from Hong Kong comes from associated Chinese firms from the mainland. The Rhodium database tracks announced transactions and can help account for investments that take place via Hong Kong, Singapore and other financial hubs, which can obscure the origins of the actual investor.\n\nChina\u2019s economic ties with South-east Asia have soared in recent years, with free-trade deals and efforts to avoid US tariffs targeting Beijing driving trade and investment from Chinese companies and other multinationals into Asean. Vietnam was the largest recipient of manufacturing investment from China last year, followed by Indonesia, according to the Rhodium report, with both seeing around US$3 billion in newly announced Chinese manufacturing projects.\n\n\u201cUS tariffs on China starting in 2017 were one of the core drivers behind the jump in Chinese firms\u2019 manufacturing FDI in Asean,\u201d wrote Rhodium analysts Armand Meyer and Agatha Kratz. \u201cMuch of US import diversification through Asean export hubs has been supported by Chinese firms,\u201d they wrote, adding that Chinese and foreign multinationals often relocate to Asean in tandem.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nFriday, 8.30 am\n\nAsean Business\n\nBusiness insights centering on South-east Asia's fast-growing economies.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\n\u201cContinued and even higher US tariffs on China-made goods can be expected to drive yet more diversification momentum among Chinese firms,\u201d they wrote, adding that the differences between US tariffs on China and on other countries in the region, as well as how forcefully the US tries to limit China\u2019s regional supply-chain role, would affect the investment outlook.\n\nGrowing deficits\n\nChinese investment has helped contribute to a soaring US trade deficit with the region. America\u2019s bilateral goods trade shortfall with Vietnam was one of Washington\u2019s largest, at almost US$124 billion in 2024, according to US data.\n\nThose kinds of surpluses led US President Donald Trump to impose punitive tariffs on Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand and other nations this month. The US president then unexpectedly suspended most of the levies for 90 days to allow trade talks to take place.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nTrump tariffs intensify European exporters\u2019 Asean focus, say business chambers in Singapore\n\nUS officials are preparing to press nations to curb trade with China, Bloomberg reported last week, citing sources familiar with the matter. China has responded by warning nations not to strike deals that undermine Beijing\u2019s interests, making a threat of \u201creciprocal countermeasures\u201d. This places pressure on Asean members and others who rely heavily on trade with both China and the US to drive their growth.\n\nVietnam has said it would crackdown on fraudulent rules of origin as part of its fight against goods labelled as Vietnamese products. The move is widely seen as addressing one of the Trump team\u2019s key concerns: Chinese goods being shipped to the US via Vietnam to sidestep tariffs.\n\nBut that would not affect products legitimately made in Vietnam by Chinese firms or using Chinese-made parts \u2013 as long as a substantial portion of the value-added manufacturing happened in Vietnam.\n\nThe rapid increase in Chinese companies manufacturing in South-east Asia will make any demand to cut out China harder to enforce, as can be seen from repeated attempts over the past few years to stop China\u2019s solar panel industry from undercutting US producers.\n\nAfter the US imposed tariffs on imports of Chinese solar goods 12 years ago, manufacturers responded by setting up operations in nations not affected by the levies. The US found in 2022 that some imports from Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam used wafers produced in China in violation of US tariffs.\n\nThe US imposed final tariffs as high as 3,521 per cent on solar imports from the four South-east Asian nations this month, delivering a win for domestic manufacturers. However in the meantime, Chinese firms had invested heavily in the sector in other places not subject to those tariffs, with Indonesia expected to have more than 20 gigawatts of foreign-owned solar manufacturing capacity by the middle of this year, from just one gigawatt at the end of 2022, according to BloombergNEF.\n\nIndonesia was one of the largest recipients of Chinese investment into renewable energy equipment in 2022-2024, according to the Rhodium data.\n\n\u201cRecent US actions \u2013 especially recent tariffs on solar panels from South-east Asia \u2013 do reflect a broader push for tighter supply chain oversight, similar to the efforts in the auto sector with Mexico,\u201d Meyer, one of the report\u2019s authors, said. \u201cHowever, it remains unclear what specific measures the Trump administration would pursue.\u201d BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Asean\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nSuspended Thailand PM Paetongtarn hit by ethics investigation, source and media say\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:07 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nMalaysia\u2019s low-key tycoon: the empire of Syed Mokhtar Albukhary\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/f1e60b05c1f27e815a898598f12e3077777cbc66e025765a46c26ad73df49250?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Workers iron clothing items at a garment factory in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

PHOTO: YEN MENG JIIN, BT\n\n[SINGAPORE] The private housing market in Singapore appears to be settling at a new equilibrium, with prices stabilising even as buying momentum continued, analysts said.\n\nFigures released by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) on Friday (Apr 25) showed that the prices of private residential properties rose 0.8 per cent in the first quarter of 2025. This was a tad higher than the\n\n0.6 per cent flash estimate\n\nby the agency earlier this month, and eases from a\n\n2.3 per cent increase\n\nin the previous quarter.\n\nIn fact, price growth moderated across the board in Q1, save for landed homes, noted PropNex chief executive officer Ismail Gafoor.\n\nPrices of landed properties rose 0.4 per cent in the quarter, reversing from a 0.1 per cent decline in the quarter before.\n\nMeanwhile, that of non-landed properties was up 1 per cent in Q1, versus the 3 per cent growth in the fourth quarter.\n\nBy region, prices in the city fringe or Rest of Central Region (RCR) grew the most \u2013 by 1.7 per cent. This was followed by the prime Core Central Region (CCR) with a 0.8 per cent growth, and the suburbs or Outside Central Region (OCR) with 0.3 per cent.\n\nIn comparison, prices in the three regions increased by 2.6 to 3.3 per cent in Q4 last year.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nTuesday, 12 pm\n\nProperty Insights\n\nGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThe moderation in price growth came even as buying demand remained strong, particularly in the OCR with strong take-up rates at several newly launched projects, said Leonard Tay, Knight Frank head of research.\n\nFor instance, Lentor Central Residences had a take-up rate of 93 per cent, selling 445 out of 477 units. This was 87 per cent at the 1,193-unit Parktown Residence in Tampines, 65 per cent at the 501-unit Elta in Clementi, and 61 per cent at the 113-unit Bagnall Haus in East Coast.\n\nLee Sze Teck, senior director of data analytics at Huttons Asia, attributed the smaller gains in prices to a higher proportion of new sales in the OCR in the quarter. Such deals, which tend to have lower quantums, accounted for 66.3 per cent of all transactions in Q1, compared to 41.7 per cent in Q4.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nOffice rents in Singapore\u2019s central region up 0.3% qoq in Q1 2025: URA\n\nHDB Q1 resale price growth slows to 1.6% on higher housing supply\n\nNew private home sales creep up in March; record number of ECs sold for S$2 million or more\n\nBuying also remained brisk amid lower interest rates, a positive economic outlook, tight employment market and healthy household balance sheets, added Lee.\n\nNew home sales therefore held fairly firm with 3,375 units sold in Q1. While it was down slightly from Q4\u2019s 3,420 units, it was nearly treble of Q1 2024\u2019s 1,164 units.\n\nIt was also the second-highest quarterly new sales figure recorded in the last three years, with the peak occurring in Q4 2024, said OrangeTee Group chief researcher and strategist Christine Sun.\n\nAt the same time, developers launched 3,139 units for sale in the quarter, a shade lower than the 3,425 units put on the market in Q4.\n\nUnsold inventory of uncompleted private homes, excluding executive condominiums (ECs), consequently fell 6.6 per cent to 18,125 units in the quarter, from 19,405 units in the quarter before, said Tricia Song, CBRE head of research for South-east Asia.\n\nIncluding completed units, this figure was down 6.8 per cent to 18,270 units in Q1 \u2013 significantly lower than the previous peak of 37,799 units recorded in Q1 2019, noted Song.\n\nThis could be cleared in under three years, based on the five-year annual average for new home sales from 2020 to 2024, at 8,600 units, and 2024\u2019s total developer sales of 6,469 units, she added.\n\nIn the resale market, there were 3,565 resale transactions in Q1, compared with 3,702 units transacted in the prior quarter\n\n.\n\nThese deals accounted for 49.1 per cent of all sales transactions in Q1, slightly lower than the 49.8 per cent in Q4.\n\nURA data also showed that rents of private homes rose 0.4 per cent in Q1, after staying flat in the prior quarter. The vacancy rate inched down to 6.5 per cent as at end-Q1, from 6.6 per cent in Q4.\n\nKnight Frank\u2019s Tay noted that a higher proportion of vacant inventory remained among smaller units, such as one or two-bedroom flats. Thus, \u201clandlords of smaller units may need to adjust their rental expectations in order to keep their assets occupied,\u201d he added.\n\nWith demand and supply now in balance in the leasing market, Tay reckoned that rental growth will moderate between 1 per cent and 3 per cent in 2025, supported by \u201crenewals at large and continued interest in family-sized inventory\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts are cautiously optimistic on the overall private housing market.\n\nDespite escalating trade tensions and market volatility, which could dampen sentiment, ERA chief executive Marcus Chu believes Singapore\u2019s property market remains resilient. This is mainly since it is supported by domestic buyers with mid- to long-term outlooks, keeping activity rooted in \u201cgenuine demand rather than speculation\u201d.\n\nIn the remaining three quarters of 2025, 5,187 private homes, including ECs, are set to be ready.

Unitholders can expect to receive the distribution payout on Jun 6 after books closure on May 5.\n\nQ4 revenue fell 6.8 per cent to S$222.9 million from S$239.2 million in the year-ago period; net property income (NPI) for the quarter dropped 7.4 per cent to S$169.5 million from S$183.1 million.\n\nThe manager attributed the lower revenue to reduced contribution from the Reit\u2019s Singapore properties following the divestment of Mapletree Anson on Jul 31, 2024.\n\nContribution from overseas properties was also lower, mainly due to weaker performance as a result of lower occupancy and negative rental reversion.\n\nRental reversions for MPACT\u2019s Hong Kong, Japan and China properties came in at -6.9 per cent, -7.2 per cent and -9.3 per cent, respectively, for FY24/25.\n\nIn the Q4 business update, Sharon Lim, chief executive officer of the Reit manager, noted that VivoCity provided\n\nsome stability, recording 3.5 per cent and 2.1 per cent year-on-year growth in its full-year revenue and NPI, respectively.\n\nThe Reit\u2019s DPU for the full year stood at S$0.0802, down 10 per cent from S$0.0891 in the same period in the year prior.\n\nOverall portfolio tenant retention rate was 89.6 per cent, with a weighted average lease expiry of 2.2 years as at Mar 31.\n\n\u201cWe are intensifying efforts to safeguard occupancy and cash flow while exploring suitable opportunities to optimise the portfolio,\u201d said Lim.\n\nOn the capital management front, MPACT\u2019s aggregate leverage ratio fell to 37.7 per cent as at Mar 31, 2025, from 40.5 per cent the year before, largely due to the divestment of Mapletree Anson.\n\nThe average term to maturity of debt was extended to 3.3 years as at Mar 31, from three years previously.\n\nHowever, the Reit\u2019s weighted average all-in cost of debt per annum rose to 3.51 per cent, from 3.35 per cent in the year-ago period.\n\nThis was a slight decline from 3.52 per cent as at Dec 31, 2024. However, Janica Tan, chief financial officer of the Reit manager, was careful to dismiss suggestions by analysts at the briefing that MPACT\u2019s cost of debt might have peaked.\n\n\u201cWe do have interest rate swaps at high rates at the moment and it\u2019s only going to drop off in the next two years up to March 2027,\u201d Tan said. \u201cAt the moment, not yet.\u201d\n\nUnits of MPACT closed flat at S$1.22 on Friday, following the results announcement.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

As a result, prices of two-room resale flats grew more slowly, rising 1.6 per cent in Q1.\n\nAdditionally, seasonal effects such as the Chinese New Year festivities, dampened activity in the secondary market, said Mohan Sandrasegeran, head of research and data analytics at Singapore Realtors.\n\nMore flats sold for S$1 million and up\n\nLee estimates that 348 resale flats were sold for S$1 million and above in Q1, up 22.1 per cent from the previous quarter. The figure also represents the \u201chighest number of million-dollar flat transactions in a single quarter\u201d.\n\nEugene Lim, ERA Singapore\u2019s key executive officer, said that the increase in million-dollar deals was mainly due to private property right-sizers and HDB upgraders, who prefer larger, centrally located flats with longer leases. Desirable locational traits, such as strong transport connectivity and proximity to reputable schools, further support this demand, motivating buyers to pay premium prices for these homes,\u201d he explained.\n\nTowns such as Bukit Merah, Bishan and Queenstown have a higher share of such deals, said Huttons\u2019 Lee. \u201cToa Payoh has the highest proportion of million-dollar flat transactions, at 28 per cent, due to more flats fulfilling the five-year minimum occupancy period (MOP).\u201d\n\nOn the rental market front, 59,567 HDB flats were rented out as at the end of Q1, up 0.9 per cent from Q4.\n\nHDB approved 9,662 cases to rent out the flats, a 12.3 per cent jump quarter on quarter and 2.8 per cent rise year on year.\n\nOrangeTee\u2019s chief researcher and strategist Christine Sun said that rental demand usually picks up after the year-end holidays and festive season. She observed an increase in foreign students and expats returning to Singapore, mainly driven by the country\u2019s stable employment outlook and easing inflationary pressures.\n\n\u201cSome landlords were also more flexible and open to negotiating rents, given the intense competition for tenants from the private rental market,\u201d she added.\n\nThe highest median rental price was for five-room flats in Bukit Merah and Queenstown at S$4,200; the lowest median rental price was for two-roomers in Punggol and Sengkang at S$2,300.\n\nMarket to remain resilient\n\nAnalysts believe that resale prices will continue climbing at a moderate pace as demand remains firm amid macro clouds.\n\nMogul\u2019s Mak said that the ongoing trade tensions could push up demand for new and resale HDB flats. \u201cThis is because during periods of economic and job market uncertainty, some eligible homebuyers would gravitate towards more affordable housing choices,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nOrangeTee\u2019s Sun also noted that demand may hold steady as the market is primarily bolstered by domestic buyers. But she cautioned that the mid-term outlook would depend on how the ongoing trade war might escalate. \u201cAmid an atmosphere of heightened caution, many potential buyers may exercise greater restraint to avoid overstretching their budgets.\u201d\n\nThe conservative approach could, therefore, result in slower price growth in the upcoming months.\n\nStill, Huttons\u2019 Lee thinks that the resale market is \u201crelatively insulated\u201d against the impact of tariffs as it \u201cfulfils an essential need\u201d.\n\nThe HDB resale market caters predominantly to Singaporean households and owner-occupiers, said PropNex\u2019s head of research and content Wong Siew Ying, who expects demand to be fairly resilient and prices to remain stable, notwithstanding uncertainties brought on by the US tariffs.\n\nAs demand remains firm, analysts project prices to rise at a moderate pace as the government rolls out more public housing.\n\nIn July, HDB will launch about 5,400 BTO flats in Bukit Merah, Bukit Panjang, Clementi, Sembawang, Tampines, Toa Payoh and Woodlands. It will also run a concurrent SBF exercise offering about 3,000 units, bringing the total supply this year to about 8,500 units.\n\nMore resale flats will enter the market as the number of new flats reaching the MOP will rise, from about 8,000 this year to 13,500 in 2026 and 19,500 in 2028, said HDB.\n\nSandrasegeran said: \u201cWhile price pressures may persist in certain segments due to limited inventory, especially for spacious flats in central locations, the broader expansion of public housing supply is likely to ensure price stability and support long-term housing affordability.\u201d\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

PHOTO: ST\n\n[SINGAPORE] The impact of US tariffs may last for years, with multinational companies telling Singapore\u2019s government that they may have to consider whether to stay or return to the United States, warned Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on Thursday (Apr 24) night.\n\nIn such a crisis, Singapore needs a good team, he said at the first People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) rally ahead of the May 3 general election.\n\nThese companies are in semiconductors and pharmaceuticals \u2013 industries where US President Donald Trump has threatened further tariffs, he noted.\n\n\u201cIf this happens, the impact will be huge on our economy,\u201d he told the Woodlands Stadium crowd in Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC, where he is defending his turf. Such companies are a big part of the economy and hire many Singaporeans, he added.\n\nThough opposition politicians have accused the PAP of exaggerating and fearmongering, the threat is real, he said.\n\n\u201cYou just speak to any business in Singapore \u2013 they are very worried,\u201d he said. \u201cEven those that are not directly exposed are very worried because the rules keep on changing.\u201d\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThe growing US-China tensions are another concern, noted PM Wong. If Singapore is forced to choose between hosting US or Chinese high-tech firms, the consequences will be \u201cdisastrous for everyone\u201d.\n\nHe questioned whether other political parties are truly looking out for voters\u2019 well-being when they downplay the crisis.\n\nVoting for stability\n\nHealth Minister Ong Ye Kung, who was a guest speaker at the rally, criticised opposition parties for accusing the PAP of scaremongering, even as they call for more health and housing subsidies, alongside higher wealth taxes.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nGE2025: Danger of \u2018inbreeding\u2019 in PAP\u2019s candidate selection process, says PSP\u2019s Tan Cheng Bock\n\nGE2025: PAP serves Singaporeans \u2018as a combined team\u2019, PM Wong says after surprise swops\n\nGE2025: Campaigning kicks into high gear following suspenseful Nomination Day\n\n\u201cJust imagine that after the GE, the opposition takes over the government and all these proposals become realities\u2026 What would it do to Singapore\u2019s standing?\u201d he asked. \u201cWill people still see Singapore as a prudent, responsible government \u2013 or will they think Singapore has gone crazy, turned populist and spendthrift?\u201d\n\nOng, who faces a three-cornered fight in Sembawang GRC, said this happened in the UK some years ago under former prime minister Liz Truss. Investors \u201cdumped the British pound\u201d because they deemed her policies reckless.\n\n\u201cThe PAP government takes this looming crisis seriously \u2013 several of the 4G (fourth-generation) ministers who have tackled crises before, we know what to do,\u201d he said, outlining how he and his colleagues tackled the Covid-19 pandemic five years ago.\n\n\u201cVote to ensure that Singapore remains safe and stable, even if the world is in turmoil,\u201d he added.\n\nA good team for a crisis\n\nIn his speech, PM Wong promised to continue to manage Singapore\u2019s economy well and harness its resources effectively to stay ahead of changes.\n\nTo do this, he needs a good team, he said. \u201cThey say that government is about teamwork, and it is, but the individuals in the team do matter greatly.\u201d\n\nHe lauded key ministers, including \u201cright-hand man\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong; Ong; Education Minister Chan Chun Sing; and Manpower Minister Tan See Leng.\n\nHe also paid tribute to retiring politicians Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean and DPM Heng Swee Keat, adding: \u201cWe owe them a big debt of gratitude for all that they have done for Singapore.\u201d\n\nYet, he had to let them step down to make way for new people to rejuvenate the team, he added.\n\nPM Wong highlighted former chief of army David Neo, a candidate for hotly contested Tampines GRC, and East Coast GRC candidate Dinesh Vasu Dash, who oversaw Singapore\u2019s vaccination operations during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThey will help strengthen the PAP team significantly,\u201d he said. If elected, they have the potential to be \u201cmore than backbenchers\u201d and take on roles in government.\n\nUphold multiracial politics\n\nPM Wong urged voters to remember that after the general election, the real contest is not the PAP versus the opposition. \u201cIt is Singapore versus the world.\u201d\n\nExternal forces will pull society in different directions, with differing views on global developments such as the wars in Europe and the Middle East.\n\n\u201cUnder normal circumstances, we can discuss them and we can forge a national consensus, but in the heat of an election campaign, it is easy for issues to get stirred up,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf we are not careful, this can be exploited, and we will end up pitting Singaporeans one against another. We will end up dividing and weakening us.\u201d\n\nHe called on all political parties to always \u201cuphold multiracial politics\u201d and \u201cnot inflame sensitive issues\u201d.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t use domestic politics to divide Singaporeans,\u201d he said. \u201cThere must be unity because whatever our differences, at the end of the day, we are all Singaporeans.\u201d\n\nThe same point was made earlier in the evening by fellow Marsiling-Yew Tee candidate Zaqy Mohamad, senior minister of state for defence and manpower.\n\nWhat keeps him up at night, he said, is seeing how politics has become a source of division across the world. With differing views on LGBT rights, abortion and the Gaza war, \u201cfamilies and friendships are torn apart just because of politics\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs politicians, we too face personal conflicts, where we have to put national interests first ahead of our own personal grievances and faith \u2013 but we must never allow politics to feed into this, to create division among our people,\u201d he said.\n\nHe was among eight speakers, including Sembawang West SMC candidate Poh Li San, who is up against Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) secretary-general Chee Soon Juan.\n\nEncouraging voters to back Poh, Ong stressed that though the single-seat ward was carved out for this election, it remains part of the \u201cSembawang family\u201d.\n\nSDP\u2019s Dr Chee \u201cneeds to give a better explanation (on) why he abandoned Bukit Batok to come to Sembawang West\u201d, he added.\n\nDr Chee contested the former Bukit Batok SMC in the 2016 by-election and the 2020 General Election, before the seat became part of Jurong East-Bukit Batok GRC this election.\n\nOng said that when the new boundaries were released, Dr Chee told Bukit Batok residents that he was \u201cnot going anywhere\u201d \u2013 yet eventually left.\n\n\u201cTo be fair, there is nothing wrong with making a calculated political move and switching constituencies,\u201d said Ong. \u201cIt happens in politics.

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\n[SAN FRANCISCO] Intel, the chipmaker attempting a comeback under new chief executive officer Tan Lip-Bu, gave a weak forecast for the current period and said it\u2019s cutting workers to bring costs in line with the business\u2019s smaller size.\n\nSecond-quarter revenue will be between US$11.2 billion and US$12.4 billion, the company said on Thursday (Apr 24). That was well short of the US$12.9 billion average analyst estimate, sending the shares down more than 6 per cent in late trading.\n\nAlongside the results, Tan indicated that he will quickly be putting his stamp on Intel \u2013 and trying to energise a culture that he feels has become too bureaucratic. The cost-cutting plan will involve \u201celiminating management layers\u201d to enable it to make faster decisions, Intel said.\n\nThe company does not yet have an estimate for the one-time expenses associated with the cuts, but expects operating costs to be reduced to about US$17 billion this year and US$16 billion in 2026. Bloomberg News reported this week that Intel is planning to slash its employee ranks by more than 20 per cent.\n\nIntel\u2019s earnings report is the first under the leadership of Tan, a chip industry veteran who took the job last month. The board hired him after predecessor Pat Gelsinger struggled to restore the competitiveness of Intel\u2019s products. He was ousted late last year after sliding sales and mounting red ink doomed his comeback bid.\n\nA bright spot for Intel: First-quarter sales came in at US$12.7 billion, topping predictions. The chipmaker follows Texas Instruments in delivering stronger results than analysts had projected. But its weak forecast suggests that the uptick in demand was just a blip \u2013 driven at least in part by a rush of orders ahead of looming tariffs being threatened by the US, China and others.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\n\u201cThe current macro environment is creating elevated uncertainty across the industry, which is reflected in our outlook,\u201d Intel chief financial officer David Zinsner said. \u201cWe are taking a disciplined and prudent approach to support continued investment in our core products and foundry businesses while maximising operational cost savings and capital efficiency.\u201d\n\nZinsner said he does not currently have an estimate for the size of the workforce reduction.\n\nIn a separate memo to employees, Tan said he wanted to revamp the company\u2019s culture. That includes requiring staff to work in-person four days a week starting Sep 1.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nIntel to announce plans this week to cut over 20% of staff\n\nIntel will need license to export AI chips to Chinese clients: FT\n\nIntel CEO Tan Lip-Bu flattens leadership structure, names new AI chief: memo\n\n\u201cOur existing policy is that our hybrid employees should spend approximately three days per week on-site,\u201d Tan said. \u201cAdherence to this policy has been uneven at best. I strongly believe that our sites need to be vibrant hubs of collaboration that reflect our culture in action.\u201d\n\nHe said the layoffs would begin in the current quarter. \u201cWe must balance our reductions with the need to retain and recruit key talent,\u201d Tan said in the memo. \u201cThese decisions will not be made lightly.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s conference call will be the first time Tan has faced questions from Wall Street on how he plans to resurrect the company\u2019s fortunes, something he\u2019s said \u201cwill not happen overnight\u201d. Gelsinger had concentrated on Intel\u2019s factory network, once its most powerful asset.\n\nHe laid out plans to spend tens of billions of US dollars on giving the company the world\u2019s best production technology again, and luring rivals into using it as an outsourced provider of manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThe first quarter was a step in the right direction, but there are no quick fixes as we work to get back on a path to gaining market share and driving sustainable growth,\u201d Tan said. \u201cI am taking swift actions to drive better execution and operational efficiency while empowering our engineers to create great products. We are going back to basics by listening to our customers and making the changes needed to build the new Intel.\u201d\n\nBeyond its cost problems, the company missed out on one of the biggest bonanzas in the semiconductor industry\u2019s history: the explosion of artificial intelligence (AI) computing. Nvidia\u2019s dominance in that area has allowed it to far surpass Intel in revenue and market valuation.\n\nIntel shares, after several years of being shunned by investors, have performed relatively well in 2025, eking out a 7.2 per cent gain. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index, in contrast, has fallen almost 16 per cent.\n\nIn the first quarter, the company had a loss of 19 US cents a share. Analysts estimated a loss of 22 US cents a share on sales of US$12.31 billion. Last year, Intel\u2019s annual revenue was down about US$26 billion from its peak in 2021. It\u2019s now less than half the size of Nvidia by that measure, and analysts are not predicting a rapid rebound anytime soon.\n\nIntel\u2019s CFO said the company shares Wall Street\u2019s concern that a good start to the year might not reflect underlying demand and may have been helped by stocking up ahead of tariffs.\n\n\u201cThat probably pulled some demand we would have seen beyond the first quarter into the first quarter and softened up the second quarter,\u201d he said.\n\nLooking ahead, the company is concerned that consumer spending and investment in areas such as data centre infrastructure may decline. Uncertainty about tariffs is making the environment harder to predict and prompted Intel to offer a wider range of sales forecasts.\n\nIntel is focused on improving its balance sheet and is cutting the budget for new plants and equipment by a further US$2 billion, Zinsner said. Under Tan\u2019s leadership, the chipmaker will look to focus on a small number of areas and sell off units that are not related to those efforts.\n\nThe new round of job cuts, following a roughly 15,000 reduction last year, may bring it more in line with that new scale, and what competitors are achieving with fewer workers. Nvidia has about a third of Intel\u2019s staff, and manufacturing leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company gets double Intel\u2019s revenue with about 30,000 fewer people on its payroll.\n\nIntel\u2019s adjusted gross margin \u2013 the percentage of sales remaining after excluding the cost of production \u2013 was 39.2 per cent in the first quarter and will be 36.5 per cent in the current period. At its peak, Intel regularly reported a gross margin of well above 60 per cent. Nvidia\u2019s is above 70 per cent.\n\nSales at Intel\u2019s foundry business \u2013 a unit that makes chips for outside customers \u2013 rose 7.1 per cent to US$4.67 billion. That topped the estimate of US$4.3 billion.\n\nPersonal computer chip sales were US$7.63 billion, down 7.8 per cent. Analysts had projected US$6.93 billion. Intel\u2019s data centre and AI chip unit had sales of US$4.13 billion.

Nomura officials have already held discussions with regulators in Japan about its latest plans, the sources said, asking not to be named discussing non-public information.\n\nExecutives are hoping the expanded offering will help the division generate more than US$1 billion in annual revenue, the sources said. That would be more than three times what the bank currently makes from the business.\n\nA spokesperson for Nomura declined to comment.\n\nPrime brokerage, which involves banks lending cash and securities to hedge funds, has become an increasing money maker for Wall Street in recent years due to high equities prices and the growth of multi-strategy hedge funds. Industrywide revenue from the business hit a record US$27 billion in 2024, up about 13 per cent from a year earlier, according to data from Crisil Coalition Greenwich.\n\nThe moves are the latest sign that Nomura is looking to deepen its foothold in its traditional Wall Street businesses, which have been buoyed by resurgent markets in Japan in recent quarters. Christopher Willcox, who heads the Tokyo-based firm\u2019s trading and investment banking units, got US$12 million in compensation for the year ended March \u2013 a figure that meant his pay was more than triple that of chief executive officer Kentaro Okuda.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nNomura in 2021 began informing clients it would pullback from certain parts of the prime business after it suffered some of the biggest losses during the collapse of Archegos. The bank ultimately recorded a US$2.9 billion hit tied to the implosion.\n\nNomura\u2019s loss on Archegos, a little-known firm set up to manage the fortune of trader Bill Hwang, occurred after a series of internal missteps. Officials allowed Archegos to become the single biggest client of the prime-brokerage unit and charged him billions of US dollars less than the bank\u2019s own guidelines suggested while warnings about potential risk failures at the division were not acted on, Bloomberg reported in 2023.\n\nWillcox took over as head of Nomura\u2019s investment-banking division in the wake of Archegos and helped oversee improvements in the bank\u2019s risk controls. In a January 2024 interview with Bloomberg, he said the firm had made \u201cenormous improvements\u201d and \u201cI think we can say we have put Archegos behind us\u201d.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nJapan\u2019s Nomura to buy Macquarie\u2019s US, European asset management units for A$2.8 billion\n\nNomura scales back China wealth unit, seeks new securities CEO\n\nNomura in talks for offices at Manhattan\u2019s Penn 2 tower\n\nJapan's Nomura ties up with regional bank Hyakujushi to boost wealth business\n\nMore\n\nTo be sure, Nomura never got out of the prime business completely. There was no change to its offerings in Asia and the company continued to have hedge fund clients in the US and Europe, offering them prime-related services including equity finance, cross asset financing and synthetic prime brokerage.\n\nWith Bercun, though, those efforts will be more formal, and he will take over responsibilities previously fulfilled by Simon Yates, global head of equities. Bercun will report to Yates in the new role.\n\nThe company has also recently added BNP Paribas\u2019 Oliver Jacomb as head of prime sales for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\n\nRegulatory scrutiny\n\nNomura is wading deeper into prime at a time where the business is attracting scrutiny from regulators around the world.\n\nThe Bank of England, for instance, recently announced its planning to investigate how banks measure their exposures within their prime brokerage divisions after the business has grown more concentrated in recent years.\n\nThat work was a result of an ongoing, industrywide review by the central bank\u2019s Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA), which was prompted by several major events that rocked markets in recent years, including the collapse of Archegos.

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nPublished Fri, Apr 25, 2025 \u00b7 06:00 AM\n\n[WASHINGTON] US existing home sales fell more than expected in March, weighed down by higher borrowing costs, and further weakness is likely as growing concerns of an economic slowdown because of tariffs sap demand.\n\nHome sales dropped 5.9 per cent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.02 million units, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) said on Thursday (Apr 24). Economists polled by Reuters had forecast home resales declining to a rate of 4.13 million units.\n\nSales fell 2.4 per cent year on year in March.\n\nExisting home sales are counted at the closing of a contract. Last month\u2019s sales likely reflected contracts signed in January and February when the average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage hovered close to 7 per cent. The rate subsequently eased in March before rising to a two-month high last week.\n\nA dimming economic outlook because of uncertainty caused by President Donald Trump\u2019s constantly shifting tariff policy and duties already imposed on a plethora of imports, including lumber, is seen dragging the housing market.\n\nGovernment data on Wednesday showed new home sales surged to a six-month high in March, with the median price declining as builders offered incentives to reduce inventory, currently at levels last seen in late 2007 at the height of the global financial crisis.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nTuesday, 12 pm\n\nProperty Insights\n\nGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\n\u201cHome buying and selling remained sluggish in March due to the affordability challenges associated with high mortgage rates,\u201d said Lawrence Yun, the NAR\u2019s chief economist.\n\nThe inventory of existing homes jumped 8.1 per cent to 1.33 million units in March. Supply shot up 19.8 per cent from a year ago. The median existing home price increased 2.7 per cent from a year earlier to US$403,700 in March.\n\nAt March\u2019s sales pace, it would take 4 months to exhaust the current inventory of existing homes, up from 3.2 months a year ago. A four-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nUS new home sales jump in March; supply still rising\n\nUS mortgage rates surge by most in a year as tariffs hit markets\n\nUS housing starts decline by most in a year on single-family homes\n\nGerman home building permits decline in February, halting recovery\n\nUS homebuilder sentiment ticks up but tariffs weigh on outlook\n\nMore\n\nProperties typically stayed on the market for 36 days last month compared to 33 days a year ago.\n\nFirst-time buyers accounted for 32 per cent of sales, unchanged from a year ago. Economists and realtors say a 40 per cent share is needed for a robust housing market. All-cash sales constituted 26 per cent of transactions, down from 28 per cent a year ago.\n\nDistressed sales, including foreclosures, made up 3 per cent of transactions, rising from 2 per cent a year ago.

The latest index reading reflects a year-on-year increase of 2 per cent.\n\nKnight Frank Singapore research head, Leonard Tay, said the Q1 2025 rental growth was backed by occupiers renewing leases at existing premises, coupled with some flight-to-quality movement.\n\nCatherine He, research head at Colliers Singapore, said in agreement: \u201cAmid the current economic uncertainties, most tenants would consider renewing (to be) a more economical option, even at a slightly higher rent, than relocating and incurring additional capital expenditure.\u201d\n\nDespite the rental growth, the islandwide vacancy rate of office space climbed to 11.7 per cent as at the end of Q1 2025, from 10.6 per cent as at the end of Q4 2024, URA data released on Friday (Apr 25) showed.\n\nThe amount of occupied office space across Singapore fell by 10,764 square feet (sq ft) of net lettable area (NLA) in Q1 2025, contrasting with the increase of about 247,570 sq ft in Q4 2024.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nTuesday, 12 pm\n\nProperty Insights\n\nGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nOn the other hand, the stock of available office space expanded by 1.05 million sq ft NLA in Q1 2025, against the contraction of 64,583 sq ft in Q4 2024.\n\nTricia Song, head of research, Singapore and South-east Asia\u00a0at CBRE, highlighted two new completions in the first quarter: Keppel South Central (with about 500,000 sq ft of offices) in the fringe Central Business District (CBD) and Paya Lebar Green (with about 320,000 sq ft of offices). These are apart from asset enhancement works to the existing Cross Street Exchange.\n\nManulife has been secured as the anchor tenant at Keppel South Central. \u201cAlthough more leasing deals are currently under negotiation at both Keppel South Central and Paya Lebar Green, the uncommitted space in these buildings contributed to a higher islandwide vacancy,\u201d said Song.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nSingapore\u2019s prime office rents in Q1 weighed down by global retrenchments, trade tensions\n\nSupply crunch seen for Singapore Core CBD Grade A office market\n\nBifurcation of Singapore office market widens on the back of flight to quality by tenants\n\nAccording to Tay of Knight Frank, occupancies in the CBD were \u201cgenerally healthy as office landlords continued to prioritise occupancy in their buildings amid global uncertainty\u201d.\n\nTight CBD supply\n\nColliers\u2019 He expects office supply in the CBD to tighten over the next two years with limited new completions and as excess space given up by occupiers is gradually absorbed. \u201cVacancy is expected to ease, and rental growth may pick up.\u201d\n\nAs at the end of Q1 2025, there was a total supply of about 9.2 million sq ft of gross floor area (GFA) of office space in the pipeline islandwide, lower than the 9.8 million sq ft in the previous quarter. The bulk of the pipeline supply is expected to be completed in 2028 and beyond.\n\nKnight Frank\u2019s Tay said that in light of the unfolding trade war and the growing confusion in the global economy due to the US import tariff announcements, most major global corporations with regional headquarters in Singapore are likely to adopt a wait-and-see approach this year until there is more clarity before deciding on expanding or relocating their workplaces.\n\n\u201cAlthough some businesses are expected to relocate in measured flight-to-quality moves when leases expire, these might now be put on hold as a result of the emerging global trade war,\u201d he added.\n\nCushman & Wakefield\u2019s head of research for Singapore and South-east Asia, Wong Xian Yang, noted that some tenants may continue to face capital expenditure constraints, opting for lease renewal over relocation. \u201cFitted-out spaces are expected to remain highly sought after by tenants looking for cost-effective and immediately occupiable options,\u201d he added.\n\nSong of CBRE said: \u201cSingapore\u2019s reputation as a key business hub and safe haven, bolstered by its political neutrality and stable government policies, could support some office demand.\u201d\n\nURA\u2019s price index of office space in the central region dipped 0.2 per cent qoq in Q1 2025, after slipping 0.7 per cent in Q4 2024. For the whole of 2024, the price index appreciated 1.8 per cent.\n\nRetail rents down 0.5%\n\nThe islandwide vacancy rate of retail space rose to 6.8% as at the end of Q1 2025, from 6.2% as at the end of the previous quarter. PHOTO: CMG\n\nURA also released the latest data on the Singapore retail property market which showed that the rental index for retail space in the central region fell 0.5 per cent qoq in Q1 2025 after increasing by 0.6 per cent in Q4 2024.\n\nIslandwide, as at the end of Q1 2025, there was a total supply of about 5.6 million sq ft GFA of retail space in the pipeline, lower than the 5.9 million sq ft in the previous quarter.\n\nThe amount of occupied retail space fell by 129,167 sq ft NLA in Q1 2025, after increasing by\n\n505,903 sq ft in Q4 2024.\n\nThe stock of retail space expanded by 322,917 sq ft NLA in Q1 2025, following an increase of 258,334 sq ft in the previous quarter.\n\nAs a result, the islandwide vacancy rate of retail space rose to 6.8 per cent as at the end of Q1 2025, from 6.2 per cent as at the end of the previous quarter.\n\nThe price index for retail space in the central region rose 1.9 per cent in Q1 after declining 1.3 per cent in Q4 2024.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The incumbent People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) team, led by Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong, will square off with Singapore United Party and PPP.\n\nThis is even though Ang Mo Kio consistently performs well in the elections, since it is anchored by SM Lee, who was formerly the prime minister.\n\nIn GE2020, PAP clinched the win in Ang Mo Kio with 71.91 per cent of the votes, over a Reform Party team helmed by secretary-general Kenneth Jeyaretnam.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nWP chief Pritam Singh (left) joins the Sengkang WP team, led by He Ting Ru (right) on a walkabout.

From Alexander the Great to Marco Polo, from the Silk Road to the East India Company, history is filled with examples of commerce redrawing the map of the known world. But for much of history, trade was shaped more by power than by fairness.\n\nThis began to change after Adam Smith and David Ricardo showed that tariffs are economically harmful: they raise costs for importers, divert production to higher-cost countries, discourage innovation, and foster monopolies and corruption. Gradually, Smith\u2019s insights into the dangers of protectionism, the importance of predictable economic policy, and the rule of law prevailed.\n\nThe governance of international trade shifted dramatically after World War II, when the United States emerged as a dominant economic and military power. Instead of seeking economic concessions from defeated countries, American leaders championed the creation of an open, rules-based trading system.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Opinion & Features\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nDollar-selling is becoming a bubble, which may burst, HSBC says\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nSingapore shares hit new high; STI up 0.5%", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/e7d3b729217120cf3649aaebb31a933de9c4ebdf0c9607f64a4cd4006f5ef953?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "A 3D printed miniature model of U.S. President Donald Trump and decreasing stock graph are seen in this illustration taken, April 4, 2025.

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG\n\n[NEW YORK] A rally in the price of Nio\u2019s convertible bonds is not enough to allay concerns over the Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker\u2019s financial health, analysts say.\n\nNio\u2019s 3.875 per cent US dollar notes due 2029 have risen this week, buoyed by positive sentiment surrounding the sector as auto executives from around the world gather in Shanghai for the nation\u2019s premier car show. But only earlier this month they were at 67.65 US cents on the US dollar \u2013 a level widely considered distressed and the lowest in seven months.\n\nNio\u2019s shares have not fared much better. They are down 10 per cent since January and far off highs seen in 2021 when optimism that Nio, Li Auto and Xpeng \u2013 the trio of US-listed Chinese EV startups \u2013 could take on legacy automakers was at its peak.\n\nOn a positive note, Singapore-listed shares of Nio closed US$0.28 or 7.2 per cent higher at US$4.16 on Friday (Apr 25).\n\nThe company said that it prudently manages cash flow and maintains a flexible capital markets strategy.\n\n\u201cThe price war that\u2019s been going on in China\u2019s auto market over the past three years has weighed heavily on Nio,\u201d Sandeep Rao, a researcher at Leverage Shares, said. \u201cThere could be some turnaround if Nio manages to launch and successfully retain market share through its budget cars.\u201d\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThat\u2019s looking increasingly doubtful.\n\nNio, which in 10 years has not managed to make money at home on a full-year basis, is now recalibrating its expansion strategy in Europe due to increasing challenges there. The launch of Firefly, an entry-level brand that sells only one model, has been delayed and the carmaker is coming to realise its self-operated direct-sales network and ambitions around battery swapping might not fly overseas.\n\nIn China, Nio is up against intense competition from the nation\u2019s No 1 selling marque, BYD, as well as EVs from Tesla and Zeekr, which also play in the premium market. Previously only selling cars under its eponymous brand, Nio has now adopted a multi-brand strategy, introducing a mass-market offering, Onvo, and the even more budget friendly Firefly.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nChina\u2019s Nio looks to European partners to overcome expansion challenges\n\nNio to raise HK$4 billion from equity placement to fund R&D\n\nChinese EV maker Nio\u2019s net loss deepens in Q4 despite record vehicle delivery\n\nRegardless, Nio last month flagged first-quarter results that are likely to disappoint after finishing 2024 on a weak note. The high research and development expenses and large operational costs it incurs as it seeks to cultivate a lifestyle story around its cars is a key drag.\n\nIn the face of such challenges, Nio has been raising funds, mainly from external investors.\n\nContemporary Amperex Technology Co Limited in March agreed to invest up to 2.5 billion yuan (S$450 million) to help build out a battery-swapping network across China while Nio in September secured 3.3 billion yuan from a consortium of strategic investors including Hefei government-backed funds that it used to help repurchase US$378 million of other convertible notes due 2027. It got a US$2.94 billion capital injection from Abu Dhabi\u2019s CYVN Holdings in 2023.\n\nMore recently, Nio raised HK$4 billion (S$676 million) via an equity placement.\n\n\u201cNio is not in a liquidity crunch given its sound access to equity market funding and cash is adequate to cover short-term maturities in 2025,\u201d Zerlina Zeng, the head of Asian strategy at Creditsights Singapore, said. \u201cBut I do not see any clear positive earnings catalysts given the persistent industry pricing pressures\u201d so there is not much of a buying opportunity, she said.\n\nOthers are even less complimentary.\n\n\u201cRecently, most of the external funding has been equity investment, betting the company can turning losses into profit,\u201d Yu Yao, the founder of Shenzhen-based credit research firm RatingDog, said. \u201cWith its declining stock price, the debt repayment risk for Nio\u2019s convertible bonds will intensify.\u201d BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/6cec8f1f972814b838607fac196899045f28e0dd8b95cc35c4cefd5cb2182d52?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "A NIO EL8 electric vehicle at a showroom in Berlin, Germany.

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG\n\n[KUALA LUMPUR] Crypto\u2019s richest man, Changpeng Zhao, was in a playful mood as he addressed a packed house at the Ritz-Carlton in Kuala Lumpur, just seven months after his release from a low-security California prison.\n\n\u201cHow many are regulators or regulatory backgrounds here? OK, not many. So we\u2019re safe,\u201d the former chief executive officer of Binance Holdings said at the gathering on Tuesday (Apr 22) night, delighting the audience.\n\nThe reality, though, is that the man known in crypto circles as \u201cCZ\u201d is increasingly focused on advising government officials on how best to regulate digital assets. He has been named as an adviser to both Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan in recent weeks. He met with Malaysia Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Tuesday to discuss the country\u2019s potential as a crypto hub. It is all adding up to quite a turn of events for a man who pleaded guilty in 2023 to anti-money laundering failures that US officials said gave criminal groups and organisations designated as terrorists access to Binance.\n\nZhao\u2019s appearance at the Ritz-Carlton gave a glimpse into the kind of counsel he\u2019s been offering: \u201cI always encourage government to take a more relaxed approach,\u201d he said.\n\nIn laying out his blueprint for policing the industry, the billionaire drew particular attention to crypto-friendly governments in the Middle East. He said he encourages the establishment of new regulatory agencies dedicated to digital assets, such as Dubai\u2019s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority, which handed Binance a full licence in 2024 after Zhao gave up voting control in the exchange group\u2019s local entity. In Dubai, it took him \u201cliterally 24 hours\u201d to get a golden visa, Zhao added. He highlighted Bahrain\u2019s central bank as another \u201cforward-thinking\u201d regulator.\n\nBinance has also looked to the Middle East for investment: Abu Dhabi\u2019s MGX acquired a minority stake in Binance for US$2 billion in March.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nFriday, 8.30 am\n\nAsean Business\n\nBusiness insights centering on South-east Asia's fast-growing economies.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nZhao, who agreed to pay a US$50 million fine and stepped down as Binance\u2019s CEO after his guilty plea in November 2023, has simultaneously been making inroads in the US, where President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is decidedly pro-crypto. Representatives of Trump\u2019s family have held talks about taking a financial stake in the US arm of Binance, according to a\n\nWall Street Journal\n\nreport, which also said Zhao has been pushing the Trump administration to grant him a pardon.\n\nA spokesperson for Zhao denied that there had been any discussions with the Trump family about taking a stake in Binance.\n\nIn Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday, Zhao said the transition in the US from cracking down on the digital-asset industry under former President Joe Biden to embracing it under Trump has in turn triggered a \u201c180-degree shift\u201d in the mindset of regulators globally.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nBinance founder Zhao to help Pakistan boost crypto trading bid\n\nTrump family in talks for stake in crypto firm Binance: WSJ\n\nCrypto\u2019s richest man CZ turns venture capital firm into giant family office\n\nAustralia takes\u00a0Binance\u00a0unit to court over consumer protection failures\n\nFTX sues Binance and its former CEO for US$1.8 billion\n\nMore\n\n\u201cWith the US being so pro-crypto right now, all the other governments actually have to be slightly more competitive in order to retain talent, attract funds and investments,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I do encourage most governments to be a little bit more progressive than the US.\u201d\n\nBinance in Malaysia\n\nBinance has a checkered past in Malaysia. In July 2021, the Securities Commission Malaysia reprimanded the firm and then-CEO Zhao for operating the digital-asset exchange in the country illegally. Binance took a minority stake in Malaysian exchange MX Global \u2013 which hosted Tuesday\u2019s event with Zhao \u2013 the following year.\n\nAnwar now wants to reforge Malaysia\u2019s finance sector by embracing blockchain and cryptocurrencies. The country \u201cmust move away from outdated business models and the antiquated financial system,\u201d he said after meeting with Zhao and Abu Dhabi officials in January.\n\nThe Malaysian prime minister doubled down in a Tuesday post on X, saying he welcomed continued discussion with agencies including the securities regulator, Bank Negara Malaysia and the Ministry of Digital to \u201cexplore ways to facilitate and promote responsible innovation.\u201d\n\nFuture focus\n\nAfter his release from US custody, Zhao pledged in a post on X to focus on investments that would prioritise \u201cimpact\u201d over returns. He also said a new endeavour named Giggle Academy, a nonprofit online education platform, would be a big part of his life. Binance Labs, once the exchange operator\u2019s venture arm, was reorganised in January into an entity named YZi Labs that would manage the wealth of Zhao and Binance co-founder Yi He.\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s event, Zhao said the Giggle platform could help children in emerging markets \u2013 including in Africa \u2013 to land jobs from the age of 14 and upwards. Asked on stage whether that could be seen as promoting child labour, he did not exactly back down.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to be careful on this one. We don\u2019t want to violate any laws about working labour age,\u201d he said. Giggle does not offer a job market on the platform today, but it plans to in the future, he added.\n\n\u201cWe are also willing to work with labour ministries to review or at least explore what\u2019s the right working age for kids. So I do think that you will help many families when the kids can do simple jobs early on.\u201d BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Banking & Finance\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nDollar-selling is becoming a bubble, which may burst, HSBC says\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nSingapore shares hit new high; STI up 0.5%", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/2f4e6a49fa3999cb5076988bead94d0c89833511e21d39f49c9258931acb3eb0?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Changpeng Zhao, co-founder of Binance Holdings Ltd., during an event in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on Tuesday, April 22, 2025.

Some members of the party in both the House and Senate have said they\u2019re open to raising levies on top earners to help pay for other pieces of Trump\u2019s agenda, which include proposals to end taxes on tips and overtime.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson earlier Wednesday said he does not \u201cexpect\u201d a Republican tax bill to call for raising income tax rates on millionaires.\n\n\u201cWe have been working against that idea. I\u2019m not in favour of raising the tax rates. Our party is the party that stands against that traditionally,\u201d Johnson said in an interview on Fox News on Wednesday.\n\nProponents for the idea see it as a way to defuse Democratic attacks ahead of the midterm elections that the party is cutting services for the poor to pay for tax cuts for the rich.

The decline would have been slightly greater, at 3.7 per cent, if supermarket upgrading works in CapitaMall Wangjing, CapitaMall Xizhimen and CapitaMall Xuefu were accounted for.\n\nWhile shopper traffic was up 2.4 per cent year on year, tenant sales at CLCT malls were down 2.4 per cent.\n\nAs at Dec 31, 2024, the retail portfolio was CLCT\u2019s largest asset class by gross rental income (GRI), accounting for 71.4 per cent of GRI with a valuation of 17.1 billion yuan.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nIt is followed by business parks that make up 25.1 per cent of GRI, with a 5.4 billion yuan valuation, and logistics parks at 3.5 per cent of GRI, with a 1.5 billion yuan valuation.\n\nBusiness park revenue slipped 9.6 per cent on lower occupancy for some properties.

But the segment could remain defensive amid macroeconomic volatility.\n\nShophouse sales in Singapore fell to 19 caveated deals in Q1, down from the 24 deals recorded in the previous quarter. The deals amounted to S$100 million, down 43 per cent in value compared to the last quarter.\n\nYear on year, sales volume dropped 17 per cent from the 23 deals recorded in Q1 last year, and sales value declined 46 per cent from S$185 million.\n\nIn a market update on Thursday (Apr 24), PropNex attributed the declines to factors such as geopolitical tensions, impact of trade tariffs and a mismatch in pricing expectations, which resulted in investors becoming more cautious.\n\nThe top caveated deal in Q1 was the sale of a shophouse in the Telok Ayer conservation area for S$14.8 million, or S$12,488 per square foot (psf) on the land area of 1,185 square feet (sq ft).\n\nThis is followed by the sale of two adjoining shophouses on Lorong Liput in Holland Village for S$11.8 million, or S$7,027 psf on land area.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nTuesday, 12 pm\n\nProperty Insights\n\nGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nPropNex highlighted that there were fewer big-ticket shophouse purchases during the quarter, as out of the 19 caveats lodged, less than half were priced above S$5 million.\n\n\u201cProspective buyers may also be prudent about acquiring investment properties at a high price quantum, in view of the still-elevated interest rates,\u201d it said.\n\nLeasing demand also slowed in Q1, with 836 rental contracts signed, down 4 per cent on quarter. Similarly, the value of rental contracts signed in Q1 fell to S$9.1 million, from S$9.7 million in the previous quarter.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nRB Family Office markets Mosque Street asset amid increasing buzz in shophouse hotel scene\n\nReal estate sector to face stricter compliance, tougher penalties to tackle money laundering\n\nDuxton Reserve, Park Avenue Changi hotels in due diligence by prospective buyers\n\nShophouse rentals remained measured in the recorded quarter, with a monthly median rental of S$6.47 psf, up 0.3 per cent on quarter and 0.6 per cent on year.\n\nRentals saw mixed performance in Q1 across various districts, said PropNex. District 15 (Katong and Joo Chiat) observed the highest rental increase of 12.2 per cent on quarter. This was followed by District 7 (Middle Road and Golden Mile) with a 6.4 per cent quarter-on-quarter increase.

In fact, the impact of US tariffs on the Indian economy could be beneficial in the medium term, it noted.\n\nIndia\u2019s large labour supply and stable politics make it an attractive relocation destination, which could benefit its contract manufacturing tenants, the manager added.

On Thursday, however, the Trump administration signalled an openness to de-escalating the trade war with China.\n\nAsked about the tariffs, Pony.Ai\u2019s CEO James Peng said on the sidelines of the Shanghai auto show that his company did not foresee a direct impact.\n\n\u201cOn the supply side, we always try to have alternatives and backups,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think sentimentally of course this is going to affect us, especially on our plan for international expansion.\u201d\n\nThe company uses Nvidia\u2019s autonomous-grade Orin-X chips and would likely go on to use its newer Drive Thor chips that are not restricted from being sold in China, Peng said.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to imagine those chips will be on restriction.

PHOTO: BT FILE\n\n[SINGAPORE]\n\nKeppel\n\n\u2019s net profit rose more than 25 per cent for the first quarter ended March, driven by improvements in its real estate and asset management arms.\n\nThese profits, compared to Q1 in 2024, exclude legacy offshore and marine assets such as shares of Seatrium and legacy rigs remaining from the company\u2019s divestment of its offshore and marine business in 2024. Including these assets, profit would more than double due to reduced losses from the legacy portfolio.\n\nKeppel\u2019s shares climbed 3.6 per cent or S$0.23 after the announcement, reaching S$6.63 as at 10.37 am.\n\nRecurring income accounted more than 80 per cent of net profit in the quarter. It was driven by stable results in the infrastructure segment, improved contributions from real estate and stronger asset management returns, the company noted.\n\nKeppel also reported asset monetisations of S$347 million to date in 2025, mostly from divestments of real estate assets in China and Vietnam. The company said that it is also in advanced negotiations for an additional S$550 million in divestments to be finalised in upcoming months.\n\nAsset management fees increased by 9 per cent year on year to S$96 million, the company reported, rising from S$88 million in Q1 of 2024. It raised S$1.6 billion in equity during the quarter \u2013 3.5 times higher than the same period last year \u2013 and secured S$2 billion in capital commitments for new private funds, representing about S$4.9 billion in projected funds under management.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nIn its infrastructure segment, the company reported steady earnings, including growth in long-term contract revenue by 31 per cent year on year, reaching S$6.3 billion. It also reported commissioning readiness in its Keppel Sakra Cogen Plant and that it had seeded a 36 per cent stake of its Keppel Merlimau Cogen Plant to Keppel Core Infrastructure Fund.\n\nIn its connectivity business segment, Keppel reported progress on the Bifrost subsea cable, reaching 92 per cent completion as of March. The cable system is expected to be operational in the second half of 2025. The company also expects the\n\njoint investment\n\nin subsea cable solutions provider Global Marine Group by Keppel Infrastructure Trust and Keppel Infrastructure Fund to enhance its connectivity business and digital infrastructure strategy.\n\nFacing tariff volatility, the company remained cautiously optimistic. Loh Chin Hua, Keppel\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe direct impact of the US tariffs on Keppel is expected to be limited, as Keppel is not engaged in the manufacturing or export sectors.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nKeppel secures S$2 billion in fresh capital commitments across flagship funds\n\nKeppel enters joint venture to develop 19 plots of land in Tianjin\n\nHe cautioned: \u201cHowever, a trade war would be highly detrimental to the international economy, and could affect us indirectly through higher supply chain costs, reduced market confidence, exchange rate risks and the pace of asset monetisation.\u201d\n\nStill, the company\u2019s stronger recurring income would enhance its ability to navigate volatility, Loh said. He also noted that the company is involved in meeting demand for alternative real assets that are supported by macrotrends, including energy transition, digitalisation and artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cTricky patch\u201d\n\nIn an earnings call on Thursday morning, Loh said that Keppel is in a \u201ccomfortable\u201d position with its liquidity and gearing, but remains \u201cextra watchful\u201d in the current environment. \u201cWe believe that as we pivot more into an asset-light model, our growth is being funded through the FUM (funds under management) that we raise, and there\u2019s less requirement on our balance sheet when we do acquisitions. I think that positions us very well, particularly as we go through what could be a more tricky patch ahead.\u201d\n\nAs for the legacy offshore and marine assets, Keppel is looking at how it can put more rigs to work, amid the drop in oil prices in recent months.\n\nMaking the rigs generate cash flow would \u201creduce the drag\u201d on Keppel\u2019s balance sheet and prepare them for potential monetisation, Loh noted. \u201cWhile it is a difficult market on the offshore side, we are still receiving enquiries \u2013 (not only) for potential monetisation, but also more and more on potential\u2026 charters,\u201d he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

PHOTO: REVOLUT\n\n[SINGAPORE] Neobank Revolut announced that its Singapore operations turned profitable, amid a continuing streak in the black for the wider company in its annual report released on Thursday (Apr 24).\n\nIts earnings grew to S$1.4 billion for FY2024 ended Dec 31, up from S$587.9 million in FY2023. Interest income rose 58 per cent from S$853.9 million in FY2023 to S$1.4 billion in FY2024.\n\nThis was driven by revenue growth of 72 per cent from S$3.1 billion in FY2023 to S$5.3 billion in FY2024. An expanding customer base and increased product utilisation fuelled revenue growth.\n\n\u201cWe not only accelerated our customer growth, welcoming nearly 15 million new users globally, but critically, we also saw customers engaging more deeply by adopting a wider range of our services across both our retail offering and Revolut Business,\u201d said Nik Storonsky, chief executive of Revolut.\n\nIn Singapore, Revolut hit its first year of profitability, with a net profit margin of 15 per cent. This was lower than the group profit margin of 26 per cent; however, Revolut Singapore does not have a banking licence \u2013 unlike Revolut in the UK and Mexico.\n\nCurrently, 55 per cent of Revolut Singapore\u2019s customer base is made up of customers aged 18 to 34. The fintech also increased its headcount here by 50 per cent.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nExpansion plans\n\nAfter Singapore, Revolut is setting its sights on the region, with Raymond Ng, CEO of the Singapore and South-east Asia business, leading the charge. It is looking to expand in 10 other markets, and is in the process of securing the requisite licences. Some of these markets are in South-east Asia.\n\nRather than landing in a new market in the region as a fintech, Revolut will be looking to enter new markets as a bank, leveraging on its banking licence in the UK. For markets such as Indonesia, where the regulator OJK said it will not issue new banking licences, Revolut might have to look to acquire an existing bank to enter the market.\n\nCurrently, Revolut is in \u201cconversations\u201d with regulators across the region, said Ng. \u201cWe will find ways to enter the market,\u201d he told\n\nThe Business Times\n\n.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nRevolut to roll out UK stock trading amid market chaos\n\nRevolut\u2019s road to IPO will test fintech\u2019s hype\n\nRevolut will let former staff sell stock in secondary sale\n\nCloser to home, Ng will be focused on growing Revolut Business, which launched in July 2024. More features such as an interest-bearing account and becoming a merchant acquirer to facilitate payments for Revolut\u2019s business customers in Singapore are on the cards. It aims to facilitate online payments first, before moving on to physical in-store payments for these customers.\n\nOn the retail front, Ng is looking to bring offerings that Revolut has in the UK to Singapore. This includes a higher-tier subscription plan called Ultra, which has perks such as access to airport lounges, travel insurance and eSIMs. Ng is also looking to bring RevPoints, Revolut\u2019s loyalty programme in the UK, to Singapore customers as well.\n\n\u201cWhile we do not comment on ongoing licence applications, we remain focused on offering our innovative products to customers in markets that are forward-looking and show significant potential for digital financial services,\u201d said Ng.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Conversely, the longer you take to start, the greater the potential gains that you\u2019re losing out on.\n\nInflation:\n\nLetting all your money sit in a low-interest savings account will only erode its value over time. The interest earned often lags behind the rise in prices of goods and services. Keep in mind that core inflation for this year has been forecasted to be about 0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent.\n\nUnderstanding the \u201cwhy\u201d behind investing keeps you motivated, ensuring that you\u2019re not just chasing trends, enabling you to take advantage of compounding while cushioning the impact of inflation.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nFriday, 3 pm\n\nThrive\n\nMoney, career and life hacks to help young adults stay ahead of the curve.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\n\u270d\ud83c\udffb Investing in knowledge\n\nWhen it comes to investing, jumping in without doing your homework is a risky move \u2013 especially with so many options out there.\n\nMost new investors will usually go through more well-known brokerages such as IBKR or Tiger Brokers if they intend to do it themselves, but if you intend to seek help from a financial adviser, one first step is to check\n\nMAS\u2019 financial directory\n\nto see if it\u2019s licensed. MAS also has an\n\nInvestor Alert List\n\n, which flags firms known for suspicious activity.\n\nWhen I started researching investment methods, I would Google a phrase I didn\u2019t understand, only to get bombarded with more complex jargon that can be intimidating.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\n\ud83d\udd51 Picking when to start investing\n\n\ud83d\udc72\ud83c\udffb Want to invest in China tech stocks? Here are some things to know\n\n\ud83e\udd37 Getting started with investing\n\nMaking my own investment dictionary (with easier language) helped me collate all the definitions I learnt into a single space, making it easier to refer to them when the need arose.\n\n\ud83d\udea9 Keep your eyes open for promises of high returns with little or no risk\n\nIt is important to recognise that money takes time to grow.\n\nWhen someone comes to you with a promising investment strategy, it helps to understand how the mechanics work and who is behind this investment, so that you can make a more informed decision. Higher returns always come with higher risk, so I would rather stick to well-researched and rational investments, even if it means starting small.\n\nWith scams at an all-time high, it makes sense to be cautious. You don\u2019t want to be pennywise and pound-foolish when it comes to your money.\n\nBelow are some common types of investment scams we can look out for:\n\n\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 Rein in your emotions before you start investing\n\nWhen I first learnt about investing in stocks, I was so excited to start buying individual units from companies like Apple or Microsoft, as some of my friends did. Obviously, I did not do my research and only reacted on the spur of the moment, because I wanted my money to grow as fast as possible (don\u2019t we all).\n\nBut after I started researching, I realised buying individual stocks might not be the best way to start, especially for someone with a pretty weak risk appetite like mine.\n\nIt always helps to stay sceptical, even when excited about a good investment. \u201cTruth bias\u201d is our tendency to believe what people tell us and brush off discrepancies as a \u201cmistake\u201d rather than a lie. As FT writer\n\nJonathan Guthrie\n\nputs it, \u201cWhen money is involved, doubt is the best default.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t invest because you feel excited or fearful. Invest only because you have done research, verified legitimacy and understand the risks. Eventually, I opted for a longer-term, more diversified option of\n\nExchange Traded Funds (ETFs)\n\nlike the S&P 500, deploying dollar-cost averaging instead of timing the market.\n\n\ud83c\udd98 It\u2019s okay to seek help\n\nWhile some people say, \u201cKeep your investments private,\u201d that doesn\u2019t mean you should navigate everything alone \u2013 especially when you\u2019re unsure.\n\nWhile scammers manipulate emotions, an outsider stays objective and can even offer better alternatives. Getting a second opinion from a trusted and knowledgeable person is a sign of wisdom, not weakness.\n\nGranted, knowing who to ask is also important. According to MDRT\u2019s latest consumer survey, even with the popularity of online sources and social media, Singaporeans still rely on traditional information sources for financial planning, such as family (62 per cent), schools (60 per cent), newspapers (54 per cent), and financial advisers (53 per cent).\n\nWhile there\u2019s no right or wrong way to do it (even Reddit can be a goldmine for newbie investors), consider the person\u2019s agenda and track record.\n\nAfter reading this, you might feel the urgency to start investing ASAP to make up for lost time, but be aware that this urgency can make you more vulnerable to those looking to take advantage of it.\n\nLegitimate investments don\u2019t expire overnight, and even though stocks and other assets have ups and downs, there\u2019s always time to research.

But this isn\u2019t just an exhibition of beautiful figure drawings. It\u2019s a long overdue tribute to the man who made them possible: Solamalay Namasivayam (1926 - 2013).\n\nBetter known as \u201cNama\u201d to those who knew him, he was the quiet force behind Singapore\u2019s life-drawing movement. A Colombo Plan scholar, art teacher and founding member of the art collective Group 90, he fought to make figure study \u2013 then considered \u201cindecent\u201d because it involved nude models \u2013 a fundamental part of the local art syllabus.\n\nThanks to his efforts, life drawing found its way into Lasalle College of the Arts in 1987, shaping generations of young Singapore artists who now take it for granted.\n\nYet for all this, Nama remained largely unrecognised in his lifetime. He didn\u2019t mount shows widely, rarely did self promotion, and hardly sought gallery representation. He simply believed that drawing the nude figure was essential for artists to truly understand anatomy, proportion, weight, gesture and emotion.\n\nA drawing by Solamalay Namasivayam, also known as Nama, who often looked for backpackers to pose for his classes because the locals were too shy to do so. PHOTO: YEO WORKSHOP\n\nAudrey Yeo, founder of Yeo Workshop, says: \u201cNamasivayam is deeply commendable and deserves our utmost respect. He dedicated his life to advancing artistic skills and creativity, fuelled by an unshakable belief in its importance. His efforts have borne fruit. Today, life drawing is a mainstream part of Singapore\u2019s art education. It is bittersweet that he did not live to see the full impact of his work, nor to benefit from it personally.\u201d\n\nThe exhibition titled\n\nPoints of Articulation\n\nis presented alongside a new 280-page monograph of the same name. On display are Nama\u2019s figure studies in charcoal, pastel, and ink \u2013 anatomically precise, yet alive with the messy, dynamic energy of real life.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nFriday, 2 pm\n\nLifestyle\n\nOur picks of the latest dining, travel and leisure options to treat yourself.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nLocals were too shy then to pose nude, so his models were often foreign backpackers \u2013 their bodies imperfect, unidealised, and all the more human because of it.\n\nThe accompanying monograph of Solamalay Namasivayam.

But it kept its forecast for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) demand to double in 2025, citing supply agreements made with customers a year in advance.\n\nIn the March quarter, SK Hynix reported an operating income of 7.4 trillion won (S$6.8 billion), exceeding the projected 6.6 trillion won on a 42 per cent rise in revenue.

dressed in his papal vestments \u2013 a red chasuble, white mitre and black shoes \u2013 with a rosary in his hands.\n\nEach mourner was ushered past the casket within seconds, many hurriedly catching the moment on their smartphones.\n\nArgentine Federico Rueda, 46, said that despite the rush, he would not have missed the opportunity.\n\n\u201cIt is worth missing out on other places to say goodbye to an Argentine: a very worthy pope,\u201d he said as he stood proudly wearing the jersey of Argentina\u2019s national football team, the current world champions.\n\nMexican Leobardo Guevara, 24, draped in his country\u2019s flag, said he felt \u201ca sense of peace\u201d as he filed past the body of the first pope from the Americas.\n\nFrancis, an energetic reformer who became pope in 2013, died on Monday aged 88 after suffering a stroke.\n\nHis death at his residence in the Casa Santa Marta in the Vatican came less than a month after he was released from five weeks in hospital with double pneumonia.\n\nFrancis\u2019s casket was initially put on display for Vatican staff and clergy in the Santa Marta chapel, before being transferred to St Peter\u2019s on Wednesday in a procession including cardinals, clergy and Swiss Guards.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni was among those who paid respects on Wednesday, and scores of world leaders and dignitaries plan to attend the funeral.\n\nThey include Argentine President Javier Milei and Britain\u2019s Prince William, although Russia \u2013 which has for centuries had icy ties with the Vatican \u2013 said it would send its culture minister.\n\nAuthorities, who expect up to 170 foreign delegations, have ramped up security for the funeral.\n\nItaly\u2019s civil protection agency estimates that \u201cseveral hundred thousand\u201d people will descend on Rome on what was already set to be a busy weekend due to a public holiday.\n\nAfter the funeral, Francis\u2019s coffin will be taken to his favourite church, Rome\u2019s papal basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore.\n\nHis will requested that he be interred in the ground, his simple tomb marked with just one word: Franciscus.\n\nFollowing that, all eyes will turn to the process to choose Francis\u2019s successor.\n\nCardinals from around the world are returning to Rome for the conclave, which will begin no fewer than 15 days and no more than 20 days after a pope\u2019s death.\n\nOnly those under the age of 80 \u2013 currently some 135 cardinals \u2013 are eligible to vote.\n\nCardinals have agreed that the traditional nine days of mourning for the pope, the so-called \u201cnovemdiales\u201d, will begin on Saturday and conclude on May 4.\n\nAnother meeting of cardinals of all ages was set for Thursday at 9.00am.\n\nHowever, the Vatican brushed aside hopes of an announcement of the conclave date, insisting the focus is on the funeral.\n\nAt the time of his death, Francis was under doctors\u2019 orders to rest for two months.\n\nBut the headstrong pope continued to make public appearances despite appearing tired and short of breath.\n\nOn Easter Sunday, one day before he died, he circled St Peter\u2019s Square in his popemobile to greet the crowds, stopping to kiss babies along the way.

PHOTO: EPA-EFE\n\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has been criticised for the large amount of time he has spent on foreign policy in his first year in office. However, there are some growing positive signs of London\u2019s investment in its post-Brexit economic and political leadership on the global stage.\n\nThe window of opportunity for this key development to happen follows last year\u2019s general election, which saw Starmer win a huge majority in the House of Commons. This means that the ruling Labour Party can be confident of remaining in office for at least a full parliamentary five-year term till 2029, unless Starmer decides to call an early ballot.\n\nIn the last two months, alone, the United Kingdom has emerged alongside France as Europe\u2019s leader in assembling a \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d to provide enhanced assistance to Ukraine.\n\nThis included Starmer\u2019s hosting of the Lancaster House Summit on Mar 2 of almost 30 Western nations, including Canada, to discuss next steps in the war against Russia.\n\nMoreover, this Thursday and Friday (Apr 24 and 25), Starmer co-hosts with the International Energy Agency (IEA) a big international conference on energy security. This dialogue will span across the sector, including oil, gas, renewables, electricity, nuclear, and critical minerals.\n\nEspecially since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, energy security has risen up the global agenda as countries seek to respond to protect themselves from future shocks. A key goal of the summit is trying to build a greater consensus on a holistic approach to energy security and ensure governments have the tools they need for the challenges and opportunities confronting them.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nDozens of attendees from government and the private sector will attend from Africa, the Americas, Asia-Pacific, Europe and the Middle East. This includes executives of major firms including Shell, Eni and Orsted.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is one of the biggest name politicians of the approximately 60 governments attending. This alongside many ministers from a wide range of nations inside and outside Europe including Germany, France, South Korea and Turkey.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the IEA has chosen to host the event in London. At a time of growing so-called \u201cgreenlash\u201d across the world, with widespread backlash against the climate agenda, Starmer\u2019s UK government has re-committed for the country to become what it calls a \u201cclean energy superpower\u201d. Starmer and his ministers will seek to use the summit to advance this vision, including UK plans to accelerate a new era of clean electricity by 2030.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nTrade war erodes oil demand as Opec+ boosts supply: IEA\n\nThis vision builds from the UK Investment Summit last autumn which the government claims saw over \u00a360 billion (S$105 billion) in new investment announced by business, about half in clean energy.\u202fOne driver of this spurt is last year\u2019s launch of the new Great British Energy \u2013 an investment body and publicly owned energy generation company which aims to ensure a massive expansion in clean energy to help enhance UK energy security.\n\nSince the Starmer government came to power last July, it also has confirmed funding to launch the UK\u2019s first Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) sites in Teesside and Merseyside. In a more than \u00a320 billion commitment, two new CCUS-enabled hydrogen projects will help remove over 8.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions each year, the equivalent of taking around 4 million cars off the road.\n\nMoreover, the government overturned a nine-year ban on onshore wind power construction under the last several Conservative governments. This was followed by one the most successful renewable auction rounds in UK history.\n\nGiven the emphasis that the UK government is putting on the energy agenda, it is perhaps no surprise that this issue will be one of the key ones of the UK\u2019s new, anticipated 2025 Brexit reset deal with the EU alongside defence and fisheries.\n\nOne of the energy topics under discussion between Starmer, von der Leyen, UK Energy Security and Net Zero Secretary of State Ed Miliband and EU Energy Commissioner Dan Jorgensen, is closer alignment on electricity trading, plus greater cooperation between the EU and UK carbon emissions trading schemes.\n\nYet, as much as Starmer will have many welcome friends at the summit, there may also be more challenging ones too. At the time of writing, it is unclear which US senior officials, if any, from the Trump administration will attend on Thursday and Friday.\n\nReportedly, US Acting Assistant Secretary of Energy Tommy Joyce, who served in the 2017-2021 Trump administration, will attend.\n\nJoyce is acting in post while Trump\u2019s pick to head the department\u2019s international affairs office, David Eisner, waits for legislative confirmation.\n\nJoyce, like Trump, is an avowed opponent of global climate diplomacy. Joyce has asserted that the US \u201cwill not sacrifice our economy or our security for global agreements for a so-called net-zero future, nor do we encourage any other nation to make that sacrifice either\u201d.\n\nHe has also said that \u201cthere\u2019s no greater thing we can do for our fellow human beings around the world than share with them our energy technology and our energy bounty. That includes, of course, LNG exports\u201d.\n\nThis critique builds from that of US Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who has slammed UK adherence to net-zero policy, in particular, for resulting in what he claims to be \u201chigher prices and fewer jobs for UK citizens, higher global greenhouse gas emissions...and all of this is a climate policy?\u201d Wright said.\n\nThe clash between the Trump team and that of Starmer couldn\u2019t be much starker on this issue. The Labour government\u2019s alternative pathway to energy security is through commitment to net zero and phasing out fossil fuels and renewables investment.\n\nWhile the US-UK dialogue might therefore be frosty, at least on this specific issue, there could be some scope for warmer words on wider topics, including liquified natural gas (LNG). The US is the UK\u2019s second LNG supplier.\n\nIt is no secret, at all, that Trump would like to see European countries buy more US LNG as part of the pathway to potentially reduce the new US tariffs.\n\nThis stems from the Trump team\u2019s goal of US \u201cenergy dominance\u201d through the production and export of fossil fuels.\n\nAs on the Ukraine agenda, it is therefore the Trump team that poses one of the major headaches to the UK\u2019s advancement of its energy security vision centred around net zero.\n\nWhile this will be a major challenge for Starmer, the IEA is another welcome sign of a ramp-up in the UK\u2019s growing post-Brexit international leadership.\n\nThe writer is an associate at LSE IDEAS at the London School of Economics\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Applications are due in June, with a final decision expected by December, according to the New York State Gaming Facility Location Board.\n\nNew York has become the top market for sports betting, most of which is done online. The state does not yet allow online wagers on casino games such as blackjack and slot machines.

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG\n\n[WASHINGTON] More work is needed to improve the sovereign debt restructuring process and help countries facing mounting debt service challenges, the chairs of a global debt roundtable said on Wednesday (Apr 23), as they released a new playbook to aid those efforts.\n\nThe Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable, formally launched in late 2022 to help accelerate progress on securing debt treatment for countries in default, met on Wednesday during the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.\n\nCo-chaired by the IMF, the World Bank and South Africa, the current chair of the Group of 20 major economies, it includes creditors, borrowing countries, private sector executives, debt experts, and financial and legal advisers.\n\nCo-chairs on Wednesday cited some progress on aspects for the debt restructuring process, including the clarification that debtor countries undergoing a restructuring but not in arrears to official bilateral creditors can request a suspension of their debt service payments. Debtor countries had pressed for assurance that such debt relief could be made available.\n\nCeyla Pazarbasioglu, the IMF\u2019s strategy chief, said debt stability risks in emerging markets and developing economies were broadly contained, but the uncertainty around that baseline had increased \u201cvery substantially\u201d given rising trade tensions.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of headwinds, a lot of policy uncertainty,\u201d she told reporters, citing challenges for countries with high exports and exposure to US tariffs, declining commodity prices, tightening financial conditions and declining growth.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nPazarbasioglu said there was an urgent need to address the high debt service burden facing many countries, a situation that she said was getting more acute in the current environment.\n\nThe IMF on Wednesday announced that economic pressures from steep new US tariffs will push global public debt above pandemic-era levels to nearly 100 per cent of global GDP by the end of the decade as slower growth and trade strain government budgets.\n\nThe IMF\u2019s latest Fiscal Monitor projected that global public debt will grow 2.8 percentage points to 95.1 per cent of global GDP in 2025, reaching 99.6 per cent of global GDP by 2030.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nIMF slashes global outlook as White House says trade talks pick up pace\n\nMore work needed to restructure debt\n\nPublic debt levels in low-income countries and emerging markets were already high before the Covid-19 pandemic and then rose, but they have stabilised since and look set to decline slightly or remain stable over the medium term.\n\nA few countries remained particularly vulnerable and many countries face elevated debt service challenges, with high-interest costs and refinancing needs crowding out spending on education, health and infrastructure investment. Citing ongoing challenges, the co-chairs called for further work to improve restructuring processes, including the G20 Common Framework; efforts to help countries whose debt is sustainable but are faced with elevated debt service challenges; and work to prevent a future unsustainable build-up of debt.\n\nThis would require \u201cadvancing robust progress on debt transparency, debt management, and debtor/investor relations\u201d, the co-chairs wrote in their progress report.\n\nThey said the new playbook released on Wednesday was a \u201cuser-friendly document\u201d that summarised the key steps, concepts and processes observed in recent sovereign debt restructurings.\n\nPazarbasioglu said the playbook was intended to be \u201ca living document\u201d that could be updated continually. It sets out a path that would see restructurings completed in a period of one year.\n\nThe playbook is non-binding, and recognises that each case may have its own specificities and complexities, she added.\n\nDiscussions among the global debt roundtable underlined the need for enhanced transparency and information sharing regarding restructuring agreements reached by official creditor committees. Participants also discussed the bottlenecks that can delay post-restructuring credit rating upgrades.\n\nPazarbasioglu said the roundtable had made some progress on the issue of non-bonded commercial debt and would continue looking at that closely, along with efforts to accelerate timelines, improve transparency and data-sharing.

TSMC said plans to build two factories to carry out the work near its chip plants in Arizona, with plans for a total of six chip factories, two packaging factories, and a research and development centre at the site.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to bring more advanced silicon to Arizona, you need a continuous effort to enhance that silicon,\u201d Kevin Zhang, deputy co-chief operations officer and senior vice-president, said on Wednesday. Intel, which is working to build out a contract manufacturing business to compete with TSMC, is due to announce new manufacturing technologies next week. Last year, it claimed it would overtake TSMC in making the world\u2019s fastest chips.\n\nDemand for massive AI chips that are packaged together has shifted the battleground between the two firms from simply making fast chips to integrating them \u2013 a complex task that requires working closely with customers.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nTSMC upbeat on outlook as robust AI demand offsets tariff uncertainty\n\nAMD set to produce its CPU chip at TSMC plant in Arizona\n\nTSMC sales beat estimates as AI demand soars\n\n\u201cThey are both neck-and-neck. You are not going to pick one over the other because they have the technological lead,\u201d said Dan Hutcheson, vice-chair at analyst firm TechInsights. \u201cYou are going to pick one over the other for different reasons.\u201d\n\nCustomer service, pricing and how much wafer allocation can be obtained are likely to influence a company\u2019s decision about which chip manufacturer would be best.

PHOTO: JASON QUAH, ST\n\n[SINGAPORE] From 11th-hour switches to a shock walkover and even a historic four-cornered fight, Nomination Day on Wednesday (Apr 23) was riddled with suspense and surprises up to the very last minute, as Singaporeans were kept guessing about the final slates in several key battlegrounds for the May 3 general election (GE).\n\nWith the ruling People\u2019s Action Party (PAP)\n\nclaiming victory in Marine Parade-Braddell Heights GRC via a walkover\n\n\u2013 the first since 2011 \u2013 a total of 92 out of 97 seats across 33 constituencies will be contested, with 206 candidates in the race.\n\nArguably the biggest surprise stemmed from\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong\u2019s move to lead the PAP team in Punggol GRC\n\n, having helmed Chua Chu Kang GRC since 2011.\n\nHis move is reminiscent of Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat\u2019s last-minute switch to anchor East Coast GRC in 2020, to fend off the challenge from the Workers\u2019 Party (WP).\n\nTaking DPM Gan\u2019s place in Chua Chu Kang GRC is Manpower Minister Tan See Leng, who had said earlier that he would\n\nanchor the party\u2019s Marine Parade-Braddell Heights GRC slate\n\n.\n\nAhead of Nomination Day, there was some speculation that Punggol GRC could be helmed by Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean, after he said he was\n\nnot contesting in Pasir Ris-Changi GRC\n\n. DPM Heng was also widely expected to defend East Coast GRC or be redeployed to Punggol GRC.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nInstead, as Nomination Day proceedings drew to a close at noon, it became clear that SM Teo and DPM Heng were not going to be fielded anywhere. Their departure from politics \u2013 after 33 years and 14 years, respectively \u2013 brings the number of\n\nretiring political officeholders\n\nto six. The other four are Ng Eng Hen, Amy Khor, Heng Chee How and Maliki Osman.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Wednesday afternoon, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong\n\nexplained the thinking behind the redeployments\n\n, noting that he moved DPM Gan to Punggol as it was \u201creally not easy to find a senior office-holder of a similar stature\u201d to take over from SM Teo.\n\nWith PM Wong in the west in Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC and Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong in central Singapore\u2019s Ang Mo Kio GRC, the prime minister said: \u201cThat\u2019s a better distribution of our senior leadership for the campaign. If we are elected, that\u2019s also a better spread of leadership to make sure that we can cover the whole of Singapore.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nGE2025: PAP serves Singaporeans \u2018as a combined team\u2019, PM Wong says after surprise swops\n\nGE2025: Workers\u2019 Party delivers series of surprises on Nomination Day\n\nGE2025 daily roundup: Nomination Day surprise moves, multi-cornered fights, election rally sites and more\n\nAsked how he thinks voters will take to the PAP\u2019s strategy of redeploying ministers at the last minute, PM Wong said this was not the first time this has been done, and that preparing for an election was \u201calways a dynamic matter\u201d with many moving parts.\n\n\u201cWe try our best not to have too many movements, but from time to time, we have to make some of these, and we have done so in this election,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the Workers\u2019 Party unexpectedly not contesting in Marine Parade-Braddell Heights GRC, the PAP team of Speaker of Parliament Seah Kian Peng, Minister of State Faishal Ibrahim, three-term MP Tin Pei Ling as well as first-time candidates Goh Pei Ming and Diana Pang were declared elected.\n\nAt about 1pm, WP secretary-general Pritam Singh wrote on Facebook that his party had decided not to deploy a team in Marine Parade-Braddell Heights GRC, given its limited resources, particularly after the electoral boundaries were redrawn. The leading opposition party ended up fielding 26 candidates in eight constituencies.\n\nOver in Tampines GRC,\n\na historic four-cornered fight is taking shape\n\n\u2013 the first for a group representation constituency in a GE \u2013 involving the PAP, WP, National Solidarity Party (NSP) and People\u2019s Power Party.\n\nWP expects tough fight\n\nShortly after Nomination Day proceedings, Singh told reporters outside Poi Ching School, one of the nine nomination centres, that he\n\nexpects the GE to be a \u201ctough fight\u201d for the WP\n\n, even if last-minute changes to the PAP\u2019s line-up were to be expected.\n\n\u201cWe expected this because it is no coincidence to me, at least, that areas WP would likely contest were reserved to the end, when the PAP were making their announcements,\u201d he said.\n\nWorkers\u2019 Party chief Pritam Singh speaking to the press outside the Poi Ching School nomination centre after Nomination Day proceedings.\n\nPHOTO: REUTERS\n\nAsked if WP had made a miscalculation by not contesting in Marine Parade-Braddell Heights GRC, and is instead facing a four-cornered showdown in Tampines GRC, Singh said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a case as if everyone knew in advance that the PAP would field the slate (in Marine Parade GRC).\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s a weakened slate because there\u2019s no such thing as weak candidates,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure they were watching where we were going, but this is what we\u2019ve decided to do.\u201d\n\nSingh is\n\nhelming WP\u2019s Aljunied GRC team again\n\nwith two new faces \u2013 lawyer Fadli Fawzi, who was fielded in Marine Parade GRC in GE2020, and AI startup founder Kenneth Tiong. This put to rest earlier speculation that Singh would move elsewhere, given that the Aljunied has been a WP stronghold since 2011.\n\nInstead, Aljunied MP Faisal Manap, who made his political debut in 2011, is leading WP\u2019s team that includes four first-timers in Tampines GRC.\n\nSenior counsel Harpreet Singh, touted as WP\u2019s \u201cstar catch\u201d, will go head-to-head with DPM Gan in Punggol GRC.\n\nMeanwhile, WP\u2019s Andre Low, a former disputes lawyer, will square off against the PAP\u2019s Ng Chee Meng in the\n\nnewly carved out Jalan Kayu SMC\n\n, where the labour chief is hoping to stage a political comeback after losing in Sengkang GRC in GE2020.\n\nOther key battlegrounds to watch\n\nAnother key constituency to watch is West Coast-Jurong West GRC, where the PAP and Progress Singapore Party (PSP) are\n\nset for a rematch\n\n.\n\nMinister for National Development Desmond Lee leads the PAP team consisting of Senior Parliamentary Secretary Shawn Huang, three-term MP Ang Wei Neng and two first-timers \u2013 orthopaedic surgeon Hamid Razak and lawyer Cassandra Lee.\n\nTheir opponent is PSP\u2019s A-team, comprising its top three leaders \u2013 former PAP MP Tan Cheng Bock, secretary-general Leong Mun Wai and vice-chair Hazel Poa \u2013 as well as two newcomers Sani Ismail, who runs a condo management firm, and Sumarleki Amjah, who heads business development in a multinational firm.\n\nPSP\u2019s A-team comprising its top three leaders is set for a rematch with the PAP in West Coast-Jurong West GRC.\n\nPHOTO: MARK CHEONG, ST\n\nIn an address to supporters at the Nan Hua High School nomination centre, Leong\n\nchallenged Desmond Lee to a debate on policies\n\n, saying this would help voters decide who has better ideas.\n\nHe later told reporters that the PSP was willing to accept the debate in any form and on any topic.\n\nIn total, PSP is fielding 13 candidates across six wards \u2013 two of which are group representation constituencies.\n\nResponding to PSP\u2019s challenge,\u00a0Desmond Lee said \u201cthere are platforms during GE for political parties to debate policies\u201d.\n\nHe said his team has put out \u201cdetailed proposals and local plans to benefit residents\u201d, adding that PSP should do the same.\n\nUp north,\n\nSembawang GRC is one of four constituencies\n\nfacing a three-cornered battle.\n\nThe PAP team led by Health Minister Ong Ye Kung will jostle with the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) team led by party vice-chairman Bryan Lim and the NSP team led by party chief Spencer Ng.\n\nIn the neighbouring Sembawang West SMC, PAP backbencher Poh Li San will defend her turf against SDP secretary-general Chee Soon Juan.\n\nSoon after the Nomination Day proceedings were over, all the candidates wasted no time hitting the trail as the nine-day campaign kicked off.\n\nWith campaigning now in full swing, all eyes will be on the return of physical rallies for the first time in a decade. Such rallies were not allowed in GE2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic at the time.\n\nThe police on Wednesday released a list of 51 designated rally sites that parties can make use of from Apr 24 to May 1.\n\nAmong them are two venues earmarked for lunchtime rallies \u2013 in the promenade area beside UOB Plaza, and The Lawn at Marina Bay.\n\nSeparately, all political parties that have fielded at least six candidates are eligible for two party political broadcasts that will be aired on national TV on Apr 25 and May 1.\n\nFor more election coverage, visit our\n\nGE2025 microsite\n\n.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

China plans to sell a total of 500 billion yuan of such bonds by Jun 4.\n\nThe five-year notes were sold at an average yield of 1.45 per cent, according to a trader who bids at the government debt auctions.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nAlso on offer on Thursday were 50 billion yuan and 71 billion yuan of 20- and 30-year special bonds, respectively. Those are part of the 1.3 trillion yuan of 20-, 30- and 50-year ultra-long special sovereign notes that will be offered through October.\n\nThe total issuance quota of ultra-long special sovereign bonds this year is higher than the one trillion yuan sold last year. Proceeds from the sale will be used for financing consumer goods purchases, building major infrastructure projects and encouraging businesses to update equipment.\n\nThe 20-, 30-year notes were priced at 1.98 and 1.88 per cent, respectively, said the trader who isn\u2019t allowed to speak publicly.

Despite the impending supply of bonds, the market is showing no signs of stress as some expect the PBOC to cut interest rates or the amount of cash banks must keep in reserve this year to bolster growth.\n\nThe benchmark 10-year bond yield was just around five basis points shy of a record low touched in February.\n\nChina\u2019s overnight repo rate hovered around 1.6 per cent on Thursday, the lowest since January, in a sign of ample cash levels to help cushion the increased debt supply.\n\n\u201cWe expect a supply peak in the next couple of months and People\u2019s Bank of China will keep liquidity steady,\u201d said ANZ\u2019s Xing.\n\nThe PBOC may use tools such as outright reverse repurchase agreements to manage liquidity, ANZ\u2019s Xing said.\n\n\u201cIt could also consider resuming buying of government bonds or cutting the required reserve ratio to inject liquidity at proper time.\u201d BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWhat's moving the markets?

So it\u2019s nothing fancy, but just that your gut motility is improved and that helps reduce constipation.\u201d\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nFriday, 2 pm\n\nLifestyle\n\nOur picks of the latest dining, travel and leisure options to treat yourself.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nWhile there is no exercise that treats IBS, in general, aerobic exercises are recommended. Depending on one\u2019s abilities, these include brisk walking, jogging, cycling, swimming \u201cand just getting out there, sweating it out\u201d for 30 minutes a day, three to five times a week.\n\nMeanwhile, resistance training, such as bodyweight exercises, helps with core stability and tones the body \u2013 which also helps the gut.\n\nResistance training and exercises such as yoga, taichi and pilates are also good for IBS sufferers.  PHOTO: PEXELS\n\nAnd since IBS involves a disrupted gut-brain communication, things such as yoga, taichi and pilates are also good, since they emphasise mindfulness and stress reduction.\n\nSo the idea is to gradually increase physical activity so that sufferers can enjoy the benefits of decreased stress, decreased anxiety and improved gut motility.\n\n\u201cPhysical activity is safe. It\u2019s low cost. It\u2019s effective,\u201d Dr Yip points out. \u201cAnd it improves IBS symptoms through your quality of life. So while exercise isn\u2019t a replacement for medical treatment or dietary management, it can be a powerful, complementary approach to managing the condition.\u201d\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWhat's moving the markets?

The move to prevent a repeat of the costly build-up of undelivered jets seen during past fluctuations in Chinese imports comes as the planemaker redoubles efforts to save cash and pay off debt by selling off part of its services business.\n\nBoeing took the rare step of publicly flagging the potential aircraft sale during an analyst call on Wednesday (Apr 23), saying there would be no shortage of buyers in a tight jet market.\n\n\u201cCustomers are calling, asking for additional airplanes,\u201d CFO Brian West said. Such negotiations are usually kept tightly under wraps. \u201cDue to the tariffs, many of our customers in China have indicated that they will not take delivery,\u201d CEO Kelly Ortberg said during the call.\n\nIndustry sources said the comments were seen as a message to Beijing and Washington that the tariff war between the world\u2019s two largest economies was set to impose a heavy cost as airlines try to renew fleets and Boeing recovers from internal crises.\n\nUS President Donald Trump this month raised baseline tariffs on Chinese imports to 145 per cent. In retaliation, China imposed a 125 per cent tariff on US goods.\n\nHowever, West cautioned that things could change quickly. Washington signalled openness to de-escalating the trade war this week, stating that high tariffs between the US and China are not sustainable.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nPotential new customers include India or other fast-growing markets like Latin America and South-east Asia but discussions have barely begun, industry sources said.\n\nBut finding new customers after planes have been built \u201ccan be a costly endeavour\u201d, industry publication Leeham News warned.\n\nExperts say many components, such as cabins, are picked by airlines and switching to a new configuration can cost millions of US dollars. Doing so may also create a tangle of contractual commitments and need the co-operation of the original buyer.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nBoeing reports small quarterly loss, confirms 2025 plane output targets\n\nBoeing to sell Jeppesen unit to Thoma Bravo for US$10.55 billion\n\nAir India keen to take Boeing jets refused by China airlines\n\nMalaysia Airlines eyes new Boeing jets should China reject them\n\nMore\n\nOrtberg said China was the only country where Boeing was facing this issue.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to continue to build aircraft for customers who will not take them,\u201d Ortberg said.\n\nReturn trip\n\nBoeing\u2019s public stand follows a threat from tariffs to the aerospace industry\u2019s decade-old duty-free trading status.\n\nSenior industry officials say, however, there is no clear evidence of a reported official Chinese government ban on US jets. The move to repatriate and re-market jets stands in contrast to a build-up seen during an almost five-year import freeze on 737 MAX jets into China and previous trade tensions. Two jets that had been ferried to China in March for delivery to Xiamen Airlines returned to Boeing\u2019s production hub in Seattle in the past week.\n\nA third 737 MAX flew from Boeing\u2019s Zhoushan completion centre near Shanghai to the US territory of Guam on Thursday, Flightradar24 data showed.\n\nGuam is one of the stops Boeing delivery flights make on the 8,000-km journey across the Pacific.\n\nThe third plane was initially built for Air China, according to Aviation Flights Group. The flag carrier did not respond to a request for comment. It had been ferried from Seattle on Apr 5, in the period between Trump first announcing tariffs on China and Beijing starting to enforce its own ramped-up tariffs on US goods.\n\nBoeing says China represents around 10 per cent of its backlog of commercial planes. It has been losing market share to rival European planemaker Airbus in recent years.\n\nBoeing had planned to deliver around 50 new planes to China over the rest of the year, West said. It is studying options for re-marketing 41 already built or in production.\n\nHovering in the background is Airbus, though it is unclear how the US-China rift might affect Boeing\u2019s arch-rival.\n\nAirbus has been in on-off negotiations for at least a year to try to grab a huge order of up to 500 jets, though China tends to tread carefully over all major purchase decisions during times of geopolitical uncertainty, industry sources said.\n\nAirbus said it never comments on commercial discussions that may or may not be happening.

They have persisted even as the president changes tack on an almost daily basis.\n\nThe online sellers interviewed say they declined to participate, but worry that the shock and desperation unleashed by Trump\u2019s trade war could prompt their counterparts to try and cheat the system.\n\nAaron Rubin, who sells martial arts gear online, said he received an offer from a freight brokerage to import one of his shipments from China. The brokerage offered to submit paperwork to customs stating the shipment was worth US$10,000 even though the merchandise is worth about US$30,000, said Rubin, who shared screenshots of the correspondence with Bloomberg. The undervaluation would reduce the tariff bill by US$29,000.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nFriday, 8.30 am\n\nAsean Business\n\nBusiness insights centering on South-east Asia's fast-growing economies.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nRubin said he declined the offer and submitted a complaint about the firm to US customs. He\u2019s worried companies based in other countries with shell operations in the US will offer tariff-dodging services and be out of reach of US law enforcement.\n\n\u201cIf people start saving US$10,000 in tariffs per container, it quickly adds up to billions,\u201d said Rubin, who also founded the logistics software firm ShipHero. \u201cThere are companies offering to do this as a service.\u201d\n\nOne China-based freight broker offering the services said most clients are opting to route Chinese merchandise through Malaysia and say it was made there since the tariffs are 24 per cent compared with 145 per cent for China. But many are simply postponing shipments to see if Trump reduces tariffs, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid drawing attention to his firm.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nTrump considers reducing Chinese car part tariffs: FT\n\nUS, China tariffs both need to fall for trade talks to start, US Treasury Secretary Bessent says\n\nChinese exporters retreat from US as tariffs erode profitability\n\nChina says \u2018door open\u2019 to trade talks after Trump signals tariffs will fall\n\nMore\n\nUS Customs and Border Protection charges tariffs based on paperwork submitted by importers and shipping companies. The forms describe the shipment\u2019s contents, where the items were made, their value and estimated tariffs. Deliberately undervaluing shipments or lying about their origins to reduce tariffs is illegal, and perpetrators can be subject to criminal and civil penalties.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection (CBP) declined to say if it was beefing up enforcement of these laws given the steep rise in tariffs. The agency relies largely on complaints submitted through an online portal.\n\n\u201cCBP does not publicly disclose investigative methods, sources of information, or any other information that may jeopardise the safety of witnesses or otherwise affect ongoing investigations,\u201d agency spokesperson Jeffrey Quinones said.\n\nWilliam George, research director at the customs data firm Import Genius, said the steep increase in tariffs could compel some businesses to recalculate the risks versus rewards of breaking the law.\n\n\u201cBusinesses are looking at existential crises and could be weighing the risk of paying some fines over losing their livelihoods,\u201d he said.

PHOTO: PIXABAY\n\nPhilippe Legrain\n\nPublished Thu, Apr 24, 2025 \u00b7 07:00 AM\n\n[LONDON] US President Donald Trump\u2019s toxic tariff war is not only threatening the global trading system, but also undermining trust in US government bonds and the dollar. That should alarm everyone, because the global financial system rests on the premise that US Treasury bonds are the safest assets. But investors\u2019 desperate search for alternative safe assets has also given the European Union an unprecedented opportunity. In addition to satisfying growing investor demand, a large issuance of common EU bonds would strengthen Europe\u2019s economy, security, and policymaking autonomy.\n\nThe dollar \u2013 particularly long-term bonds issued by the US government \u2013 has long been the ultimate safe haven. Even when global turmoil originated in the United States, as was true of the 2008 financial crisis, investors have sought refuge in US Treasuries. But everything changed earlier this month.\n\nAmid the market mayhem unleashed by US tariffs, investors not only dumped US stocks but also ditched US Treasuries and the dollar, buying gold, Swiss francs, and euros instead. Beyond triggering an economic crisis, Trump\u2019s wildly destructive policies are causing a crisis of confidence in the US itself.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Opinion & Features\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/5b59774033eb0be8a5ea43fc06564d2cfcc26cf3f881f14d01414c1fd1268127?w=180&h=120&dpr=1&f=webp", "alt_text": "US"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/7653298fa6ad730565f0e38990b0d1653833ae5884393ef7906531242685f6c8?w=180&h=120&dpr=1&f=webp", "alt_text": "Gold has hit multiple record highs and gained more than 30 per cent so far this year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/86dcfe4e5ee24ecb3e18d10a6c563e3c9ca2fc48eac510cf2bad17f27b68f459?w=180&h=120&dpr=1&f=webp", "alt_text": "China\u2019s status as the second-largest overseas holder of Treasuries has come into focus in recent weeks as analysts debate the nation\u2019s role in the recent turmoil."}]}

The project is a collaboration between China\u2019s Country Garden Group and Esplanade Danga 88, a private firm backed by the Johor government and the Sultan of Johor.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nJohor-Singapore SEZ snares lion\u2019s share of approved investments: Mida\n\nNew joint project office to support Singapore firms in expanding to Johor-Singapore SEZ: DPM Gan\n\nJohor has RM23 billion in investment pipeline in April alone: chief minister\n\nLandmark Johor-Singapore SEZ pact signed: 100 projects, 20,000 jobs, investments across 11 sectors\n\nMore\n\nThis US$100 billion project comprising four artificial islands in the Strait of Johor \u2013 conceived a decade ago with the aim of housing 700,000 residents by 2035 \u2013 has faced significant delays due to various factors including the master developer\u2019s financial challenges and the Covid-19 pandemic, have resulted in a current occupancy rate of only around 1 per cent.\n\nThe arrival of the first batch of investors in the\n\nForest City SFZ\n\nhas fuelled optimism among market observers. They believe that the SFZ, combined with the broader incentives offered within the JS-SEZ, will continue to attract significant investor interest.\n\nThis optimism follows the\n\nMalaysian Investment Development Authority\n\n\u2019s recent unveiling of a comprehensive tax incentive package for the JS-SEZ in February. Key among these incentives is a special corporate tax rate of 5 per cent for up to 15 years.\n\nRahman Hussin, senior partner at public policy consultancy Agyl & Partners, noted that the incentives, particularly the 5 per cent tax rate, rank among the most competitive in South-east Asia.\n\nHe noted that the JS-SEZ\u2019s tax benefits either match or exceed those offered by Thailand\u2019s Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) and Indonesia\u2019s Batam Free Trade Zone.\n\n\u201cJohor\u2019s proximity to Singapore and ongoing infrastructure investments further bolster its regional appeal,\u201d he added.\n\nJulia Goh, senior economist at UOB Malaysia, noted that the income tax rates designed to attract talent are comparable to those in Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cOverall, we anticipate that these initial incentives and policies will be expanded and refined to progressively support the JS-SEZ,\u201d she added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It was first issued in 2018 by Beijing.\n\nThe relaxation comes as US tariffs threaten more pressure on China\u2019s economy, which is already reeling from weak domestic consumption and a debt crisis in the property sector.\n\nChina\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said on Thursday (Apr 24) that the 2025 version of the list lowers the \u201centry threshold and stimulates market vitality\u201d.\n\nA number of areas have been partially liberalised, the NDRC said, including television production, telecommunication services, online information services for pharmaceuticals and medical devices, the use of radioactive drugs by medical institutions, and the import of forest seeds.\n\nLocal governments are also encouraged to allow greater access in areas such as transportation and logistics, freight forwarding and vehicle rental services.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nMarket access to investing in unmanned aerial vehicles and new tobacco products such as e-cigarettes is included on the negative list to \u201censure a safe bottom line\u201d, the regulator said, without giving further details.\n\nChina had said in February it would further break down investment barriers and revise its negative list for market access as soon as possible. Since then Chinese officials have stepped up a charm offensive to assure global business leaders of China\u2019s long-term economic prospects.\n\nThe frequency of meetings with multinational companies accelerated after foreign direct investment plummeted 27.1 per cent in local currency terms in 2024 from the year earlier, the biggest drop since the 2008 global financial crisis.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nChina\u2019s export-led growth exposes economy to steeper tariff hit\n\nChina accelerates budget spending to counter tariff woes\n\nChina Q1 GDP growth beats expectations, but US tariff shock dims outlook\n\nChina gets worst 2025 growth forecast yet with downgrade by UBS\n\nMore\n\nThe NDRC said the policy it calls \u201centry unless prohibited\u201d would help improve market access and business vitality.\n\n\u201cBetter promotion of the \u2018entry unless prohibited\u2019 model will help encourage social capital, especially private investment, and promote scientific and technological innovation and healthy industrial competition.\u201d REUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Global\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:54 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nChina biotech\u2019s stunning advance is changing the world\u2019s drug pipeline\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

PHOTO: AFP\n\n[WASHINGTON] US business activity slowed to a 16-month low in April and prices charged for goods and services soared amid uncertainty caused by tariffs, reinforcing financial market fears of stagflation that could put the Federal Reserve in a tough spot.\n\nThe survey from S&P Global on Wednesday (Apr 23) also showed President Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist trade policy, which has boosted the United States\u2019 average effective tariff rate to levels not seen in more than a century, and an immigration crackdown were hurting goods exports and tourism.\n\nBusinesses were also reluctant to hire, which S&P Global said was blamed on \u201cconcerns over the economic outlook and demand environments both at home and in export markets, with rising cost concerns and labor availability.\u201d Confidence about business conditions over the next 12 months also deteriorated.\n\nS&P Global\u2019s flash US Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, dropped to 51.2 this month. That was the lowest level since December 2023 and followed a reading of 53.5 in March. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the private sector.\n\nThe survey was conducted between April 9-22, well after Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs announcement and subsequent 90-day delay of reciprocal duties on more than 50 trade partners. Trump, however, raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145 per cent.\n\nBeijing retaliated with duties of its own, unleashing a trade war between the two economic giants. A 10 per cent universal tariff on nearly all trading partners remains in effect as do 25 per cent duties on automobiles, steel and aluminium.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThe tariffs, which Trump sees as a tool to raise revenue to offset his promised tax cuts and to revive a long-declining US industrial base, have stoked fears of high inflation and stagnation in economic growth.\n\nThat has partly resulted in investors dumping US assets.\n\nThe pullback in the Composite PMI suggested that economic activity was tepid at the start of the second quarter.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nChina says \u2018door open\u2019 to trade talks after Trump signals tariffs will fall\n\nEconomists believe economic growth braked sharply in the first quarter, with gross domestic product estimates converging below a 0.5 per cent annualised rate.\n\nThe government is scheduled to publish its advance GDP estimate for the January-March quarter next Wednesday, which will coincide with Trump\u2019s 100 days in office. The economy grew at a 2.4 per cent pace in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cOutput rose in April at its slowest pace since December 2023, indicating that the US economy is growing at a modest annualised rate of just 1.0 per cent,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nFederal Reserve chair Jerome Powell last week suggested the Fed was in no rush to move on interest rates, but cautioned Trump\u2019s tariff policies risked pushing inflation and employment further from the US central bank\u2019s goals. The Fed\u2019s benchmark overnight interest rate is currently in the 4.25 per cent-4.50 per cent range.\n\nThe S&P Global survey\u2019s business confidence measure was the lowest since July 2022. Its measure of new orders received by businesses slipped to 52.5 from 53.3 in March, hampered \u201cby a fall in exports of services, which include tourism-related activities as well as cross-border activities by service providers on a scale not seen since January 2023.\u201d\n\nManufacturing orders ticked up, but that was offset by declining exports, also attributed to trade policy. Prices charged by businesses for goods and services increased to a 13-month high of 55.2 from 53.5 in March, driven mostly by manufacturers.\n\n\u201cThese higher prices will inevitably feed through to higher consumer inflation, potentially limiting the scope for the Fed to reduce interest rates at a time when a slowing economy looks in need of a boost,\u201d said Williamson.\n\nA gauge of employment slipped to 50.8 from 51.5 in March. The survey\u2019s flash manufacturing PMI edged up to 50.7 from 50.2 in March. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the manufacturing PMI declining to 49.1.\n\nIts flash services PMI dropped to 51.4 from 54.4 last month.

Along with retreating from global climate diplomacy, the US has recently added to geopolitical tensions with import tariffs that have rattled worldwide markets for weeks.\n\n\u201cRegardless of changes in the international landscape, China\u2019s efforts to combat climate change will not slow down, its push for international cooperation will not weaken, and its commitment to building a community with a shared future for mankind will not cease,\u201d Xi said in the meeting, according to a report from state-run CCTV.\n\nA \u201ccertain major country\u201d is keen on unilateralism and protectionism and has caused \u201cserious impact\u201d on international rules and order, Xi also said, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.\n\nThe gathering was designed to build momentum on the fight against global warming at a time when countries\u2019 have been distracted by everything from trade wars to actual wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Even before Trump entered office this year, the world was already behind on the emissions cuts and investment in green technologies needed to avoid catastrophic warming by the end of this century.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nFriday, 12.30 pm\n\nESG Insights\n\nAn exclusive weekly report on the latest environmental, social and governance issues.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThe world surpassed 1.5 deg C of warming on an annual basis for the first time last year and will warm about 2.6 deg C by the end of the century if countries implement their current plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. That means more ambitious cuts are needed to keep warming at a longer term average of 1.5 deg C, which is what countries agreed to when they signed the Paris accord a decade ago.\n\n\u201cOur world faces massive headwinds and a multitude of crises, but we cannot allow climate commitments to be blown off course,\u201d Guterres said in a speech shortly after the meeting ended. \u201cDissenters and fossil fuel interests may try to stand in the way but, as we heard today, the world is moving forward.\u201d\n\nSo far, only 19 of the 195 signatories of the deal have presented new emissions cutting plans for the next decade, also known as nationally determined contributions or NDCs. Among them are the UK, Canada, Japan, Brazil, the United Arab Emirates and the US, which submitted the plan under former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. Neither the EU nor China have submitted theirs yet.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nWorld\u2019s sea ice cover hits record low in February\n\nFighting global warming in nations\u2019 self-interest: UN climate chief\n\nTop climate scientist declares 2 deg C climate goal \u2018dead\u2019\n\n2024 was the first year above 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming, scientists say\n\nMore\n\n\u201cBefore COP30 in Belem, China will announce its nationally determined contribution targets for 2035, covering the entire scope of the economy, including all greenhouse gases,\u201d Xi said, according to the CCTV report.\n\nMany of the 17 participants in the meeting on Wednesday agreed to present new plans by September, when the UN will hold a special event, Guterres said. Some of the noteworthy leaders who attended were French President Emmanuel Macron, Spain\u2019s Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, Kenya President William Ruto, Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley and Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine.\n\nThe list of countries invited was made up by Brazil and the UN and there was no invitation to the US government, according to a senior source from Brazil\u2019s government, who asked not to be identified as the discussion was not public.\n\nBrazil\u2019s Foreign Affairs Minister Mauro Vieira called the meeting a success as it had a \u201cbig impact with the participation of important leaders, such as the European Union and China.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe held this meeting precisely to call on countries to present their NDCs because there is a long delay,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for ambitious targets.\u201d\n\nThe new plans will set the tone of the COP30 summit, the annual climate gathering that will take place in the Amazonian city of Belem, in Brazil, in November. Global leaders and climate diplomats attending will need to come up with a roadmap to mobilise US$1.3 trillion a year in climate funding for developing countries by 2035, while developing nations will expect rich countries to fulfil their promise to double adaptation finance to at least US$40 billion a year.

The team took 25.39 per cent of the vote against a PAP team led by then-senior minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nTwo of those candidates return in GE2025: secretary-general Ravi Philemon, who is contesting Nee Soon GRC, and Liyana Dhamirah, who is running in the newly formed Jurong East-Bukit Batok GRC.\n\nPhilemon and former chairperson Michelle Lee formed RDU in May 2020, after leaving PSP. Lee later left RDU and was replaced as party chair by David Foo, who is also on this year\u2019s Nee Soon GRC slate.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after his team\u2019s nomination for Nee Soon GRC was accepted at Chongfu School, Philemon said that the next nine days of campaigning will be tough.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nGE2025: PAP faces SDP, NSP in three-corner fight for Sembawang GRC\n\nGE2025: What surprises might Nomination Day bring?\n\nGE2025 live updates: Who\u2019s running in your constituency?\n\nHe said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be hitting the ground in the morning, going back to office to do admin in the afternoon, and in the evening, hitting the ground again in the middle of this...

The remaining 12 are either incumbent MPs, or former candidates in previous elections.\n\nThe Harpreet Singh factor\n\nOne big question in the lead up to Nomination Day was where newcomer and \u201cstar catch\u201d Harpreet Singh, 59, would be fielded.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nSpeculation tended towards Marine Parade-Braddell Heights GRC \u2013 where the senior counsel was previously spotted \u2013 or East Coast GRC, where the WP was expected to field a strong team.\n\nThere was also the possibility that he would run solo \u2013 perhaps in the newly formed Jalan Kayu SMC, in a face-off with labour chief Ng Chee Meng.\n\nInstead, fellow first-timer Andre Low, a 33-year-old product manager, will go\n\nhead-to-head with former minister\n\nNg, who was unseated by a team of WP fresh faces in GE2020.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\n\u2018No coincidence\u2019 that PAP reserved areas WP was interested in contesting to the end: Pritam Singh\n\nGE2025: \u2018Don\u2019t fly back to the same old answers\u2019 \u2013 Workers\u2019 Party newcomer Kenneth Tiong wants to offer fresh ideas\n\nGE2025 daily roundup: Nomination Day surprise moves, multi-cornered fights, election rally sites and more\n\nGE2025: Teo Chee Hean, Heng Swee Keat among 20 PAP MPs who have stepped down\n\nGE2025: New-ish kid on the block Red Dot United fields second-largest opposition slate\n\nMore\n\nSingh, meanwhile, is contesting\n\nPunggol GRC\n\nwith three fellow newcomers: Alexis Dang, Siti Alia Mattar and Jackson Au.\n\nBut the PAP had its own surprises, with Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong making an eleventh-hour switch to helm its Punggol team, contrary to his earlier introduction as the anchor minister for Chua Chu Kang GRC.\n\nThis made for a heavyweight PAP slate of three political officers: DPM Gan, Minister of State for Home Affairs Sun Xueling and Senior Minister of State for Digital Development and Information Janil Puthucheary. Rounding it out is incumbent Yeo Wan Ling.\n\nNewcomer Andre Low will face-off against labour chief Ng Chee Meng in Jalan Kayu SMC.

He and Koh were in WP\u2019s GE2020 Marine Parade team.\n\nIn a partial rematch, they now face a PAP team led by Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong, who was in the PAP\u2019s GE2020 Marine Parade team.\n\nThis is as former East Coast GRC anchor minister DPM Heng Swee Keat announced his retirement from politics.\n\nTong replaces him in East Coast, leading a team comprising incumbents Tan Kiat How and Jessica Tan, as well as new faces Dinesh Vasu Dash and Hazlina Abdul Halim.\n\nThe WP\u2019s East Coast GRC team comprises (from left) Yee Jenn Jong, Nathaniel Koh, Jasper Kuan, Sufyan Mikhail Putra and Paris Parameswari.

The holding has an equity value of US$14.2 billion.\n\nUS President Donald Trump hailed the deal as a \u201creclaiming\u201d of the canal. Chinese state media, however, have criticised it as a betrayal of China\u2019s interests, and the country\u2019s market regulator has launched an antitrust review.\n\nWhether PSA, a ports operator wholly owned by Singapore state investor Temasek, ultimately decides to sell will depend on whether CK Hutchison goes ahead with the transaction, the two people said. CK Hutchison and the BlackRock-led consortium have agreed to exclusive talks for 145 days.\n\nThe people, who were not willing to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue, declined to comment on a potential sale price for PSA\u2019s stake.\n\nPSA declined to comment. CK Hutchison did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThe deal between CK Hutchison and the BlackRock consortium encompasses 43 ports in 23 countries. The business has an enterprise value, which includes debt, of US$22.8 billion.\n\nOverall, the Hong Kong conglomerate has interests in 53 ports. Ports in Hong Kong and mainland China were not included in the deal.\n\nPSA bought its 20 per cent stake for US$4.4 billion in 2006, and has looked at selling previously. Reuters reported in late 2022 that PSA weighed a potential sale. But the two sources said it put the process on hold months later after global shipping activity weakened.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nCK Hutchison shares erase all gains since Panama ports deal\n\nUS will not let China disrupt Panama Canal: US Defence Secretary\n\nHong Kong firm did not uphold Panama Canal ports contract: Panama audit\n\nChina restricts companies from investing in US as tensions rise\n\nXi showdown with Li Ka-shing threatens China\u2019s pro-business push\n\nChina pauses new deals with Li Ka-shing family after Panama ports plan\n\nMore\n\nOutside of its stake in CK Hutchison, PSA has 70 terminals in 45 countries, including its two flagship ports in Singapore and Belgium, according to its website.

Their overseas settlements in the American currency accounted for 41.4 per cent of the total in March, down from more than 70 per cent in early 2018 during US President Donald Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nTrade tensions between China and the US have been building in recent months, as Trump rolled out higher global tariffs in early April and slapped duties of 145 per cent on the Asian nation\u2019s exports.

The ward was formerly an opposition stronghold, held by ex-SPP chief Chiam See Tong for 27 years.\n\nPAR comprises PV, the Reform Party and the Democratic Progressive Party. It previously included the People\u2019s Power Party, which withdrew from the coalition in February over irreconcilable strategic differences.\n\nBefore entering Kong Hwa School, one of nine nomination centres for the general election, Lim told reporters: \u201cThe whole of Singapore is like an orchard with fruit trees, bearing very sweet fruit for the opposition this year, so we are very confident. On the other hand, I think the ground is not so sweet for the PAP.\u201d\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nHe added that people should not worry about the so-called \u201csplitting of opposition votes\u201d in multi-cornered fights. \u201cWe have seen from past history that... opposition supporters and those... who do not want the PAP gravitate towards the strongest candidate, because people all want to back a winner.\u201d\n\nOver at Jalan Besar, PAR will be fielding four candidates to contest the Group Representation Constituency. They will be going up against the incumbent PAP team helmed by Minister for Digital Development and Information Josephine Teo.\n\nThe PAR candidates are private tutor Chiu Shin Kong; businessman Hamim Aliyas; preschool teacher Vigneswari Ramachandra; and nurse Sarina Abu Hassan.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nGE2025: Tan See Leng anchors Chua Chu Kang GRC in surprise move; PM Wong faces SDP in Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC\n\nGE2025: West Coast sees repeat battle, with PSP\u2019s Tan Cheng Bock leading team against PAP\n\nGE2025: PAP\u2019s Ng Chee Meng to face WP\u2019s Andre Low in Jalan Kayu SMC\n\nThe PAP team led by Teo comprises incumbent Jalan Besar GRC MPs Denise Phua and Dr Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah, as well as political newcomer Shawn Loh. Loh, a former Ministry of Finance director, replaces Senior Minister of State for Defence Heng Chee How in the Whampoa ward.\n\nThe PAP team won with over 60 per cent of the vote share in the last two general elections. In 2020, it secured 65.37 per cent of the votes against a team from PV.\n\nAt Mountbatten SMC, independent candidate Jeremy Tan will be challenging PAP new face Gho Sze Kee for the single seat.\u00a0Tan claims to be Singapore\u2019s first \u201cBitcoin candidate\u201d and a retiree.\n\nGho, who is an associate director of boutique law firm AsiaLegal, replaces four-term MP Lim Biow Chuan, who is stepping down after nearly two decades of serving the area. In 2020, Lim won against Sivakumaran Chellappa of PV with 73.84 per cent of the votes.\n\nGho said she has been working the ground for 13 years, understanding the needs of residents and advocating for them. \u201cThat\u2019s why I hope I will be given a chance,\u201d she added.\n\nAt the close of nomination proceedings at Kong Hwa School, Tan brought up challenges plaguing the country, such as the cost of living, housing affordability and inflation.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is not a red, white or blue party issue. This is a Singaporean issue... We need people from all the different parties, sincere and hardworking, inside the Parliament in order to (address these issues).\u201d\n\nSingapore goes to the polls on May 3.\n\nFor more election coverage, visit our\n\nGE2025 microsite\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Singapore\n\nSingapore boosts support for Timor-Leste as it prepares to join Asean\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:36 PM\n\nEconomists upgrade 2025 outlook after\u00a0\nQ2 GDP turns out better than expected\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:02 PM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nDaily Debrief: What Happened Today (Jul 14)\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:30 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nSingapore GDP up 4.3% in Q2, well above market expectations amid US tariff pause\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:00 AM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nDollar-selling is becoming a bubble, which may burst, HSBC says\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nSingapore shares hit new high; STI up 0.5%", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/a2464022584c2d30619cb56ee8df1b6ba35a2452c9d9351e44feb5d4eed6b20d?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "The PAP slate for Jalan Besar GRC running in GE 2025.

It fell 0.8 per cent or S$896 to S$117,003.\n\nCategory B is for cars with engines of more than 1,600 cc in capacity or with more than 97 kW, or for EVs with more than 110 kW.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThe premium for Category C, applicable to commercial vehicles and buses, decreased 5.5 per cent or S$3,781 to S$65,001.\n\nPrices for Category D, used for motorcycles, dipped 5.9 per cent, or S$580, to S$9,309.\n\nCategory E, the open category which can be used to register any type of motor vehicle except for motorcycles, rose by 0.9 per cent or S$999 to S$118,001.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nCOE premiums rise for most categories; mainstream car premium nears S$100,000\n\nRide-hail drivers may remain in short supply even as Singapore\u2019s demand keeps rising\n\nSingapore rejects separate COE category for private-hire cars, but will further support taxi fleet growth\n\nCOE premiums are higher than ever \u2013 will they continue this way?\n\nGrab\u2019s entry into taxi sector given green light on organic growth: CCCS, LTA\n\nMore\n\nVery high demand\n\nCar dealers BT spoke to said that the continued rise in Category A premium was unexpected and may have been driven by strong demand for EVs \u2013 and uncertainty about the continuation of rebates for them.\n\nAnthony Teo, managing director of BYD distributor and dealer Vantage Automotive, said: \u201cWith the announcement of the new, increased COE quota, I thought it would make more buyers wait and see and hold back. But (Category A) has gone up quite a bit, which I did not expect. That means Category A demand is very, very strong.\u201d\n\nOn Apr 16, the Land Transport Authority announced the COE quota for the period May to July, with the overall COE quota increasing by 6.4 per cent to 18,232, compared with the period from February to April. Category A will increase by 10 per cent to 7,511, while Category B will grow by 5 per cent to 4,689 pieces.\n\nNicholas Wong, the chief executive officer for authorised Honda dealer Kah Motor, said: \u201cCOE supply is rising and everyone is expecting COE premiums to come down, but instead it has steadily increased to nearly S$100,000 (from February).\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that the number of bids received in Category A compared to the quota was almost double at 1.9. In February\u2019s first round of bidding, when Category A was at its nadir for 2025, the ratio was around 1.3.\n\nHot to go\n\nTeo, Wong, as well as Ng Choon Wee, commercial director for Hyundai distributor Komoco Motors, said that a large number of EV models competing in Category A have contributed to high premiums.\n\nAs Category A premiums are typically less than that of Category B, and EVs receive up to S$40,000 in incentive, \u201cevery car brand is trying to get into the Category A EV segment\u201d, said Wong.\n\nFor example, most of BYD\u2019s most popular cars are in Category A, including the M6 and Atto 3 models. BYD is the best-selling brand in Singapore for the first quarter of 2025 and sold 1 in 5 cars here.  At least three Category A Evs have launched here since February, including the Tesla Model Y, MG S5 and GAC Aion V.\n\nVantage\u2019s Teo observed that demand for BYD\u2019s Category A EVs has continued, despite the higher premium, which shows that buyers are focused on this segment.\n\nBut Kah Motor\u2019s Wong said that uncertainty about those incentives could be fuelling buying now, leading to increased COE price pressure.\n\nEVs can receive up to S$40,000 total incentives from the EV Early Adoption Scheme and Vehicle Emissions Scheme, both of which will run until the end of 2025.\n\n\u201cThe authorities will review the rebates at the end of this year, and of course there is the possibility that it could be reduced or removed, but nobody knows,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere is an anxiety that these (rebates) will not last forever, and I\u2019d better buy now or lose out.\u201d\n\nBut even with more COE supply incoming in May, dealers think COE premiums may not fall, such is the strength of demand.\n\n\u201cDemand for both Category A and B is very high. (Premiums) are not going to come down soon,\u201d said Vantage\u2019s Teo.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It has depreciated more than 4.6 per cent so far amid investor concerns over Prabowo\u2019s controversial fiscal agenda and softening domestic consumption.\n\nThe decline comes despite a softer US Dollar Index, which has eased amid capital outflows from the US driven by trade tensions and growing recession fears.\n\nAnalysts at Nomura noted in a report that bond markets in Indonesia, and to some extent South Korea, could be more vulnerable to offshore outflows amid shifts in US yields.\n\n\u201cIndonesian bonds are somewhat vulnerable, in our view. BI is one of the most sensitive Asian central banks to FX rates, so it will be less willing to look through FX risks to local developments,\u201d they wrote.\n\nBI\u2019s Warjiyo said the central bank will intervene in the offshore non-deliverable forwards market by issuing securities to attract more foreign inflows and help stabilise the rupiah.\n\nThe central bank previously intervened in the offshore market on Apr 7, just days after the sweeping tariff measures announced by Trump on Apr 2.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Asean\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nSuspended Thailand\u2019s PM Paetongtarn hit by ethics investigation, source and media say\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:07 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nMalaysia\u2019s low-key tycoon: the empire of Syed Mokhtar Albukhary\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/6ff750af49d89ad84f6ac5118df0621100769296bd0cf4caf78d7d4186890959?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "An employee shows Indonesian Rupiah banknotes at a money changer in Jakarta on April 10, 2025.

Intel had 108,900 employees at the end of 2024, down from 124,800 the previous year.\n\nA representative for Intel declined to comment.\n\nTan is aiming to turn around the iconic chipmaker after years of Intel ceding ground to rivals. The California-based company lost its technological edge and has struggled to catch up with Nvidia in artificial intelligence (AI) computing. That contributed to three straight years of sales declines and mounting red ink.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nTan, a veteran of Cadence Design Systems, has vowed to spin off Intel assets that are not central to its mission and create more compelling products.\n\nLast week, the company agreed to sell a 51 per cent stake in its programmable chips unit Altera to Silver Lake Management, a step towards that goal.\n\nIntel needs to replace the engineering talent it has lost, improve its balance sheet and better attune manufacturing processes to the needs of potential customers, Tan said last month at the Intel Vision conference.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nIntel will need license to export AI chips to Chinese clients: FT\n\nIntel CEO Tan Lip-Bu flattens leadership structure, names new AI chief: memo\n\nIntel, TSMC recently discussed chipmaking joint venture: report\n\nThe company is scheduled to report first-quarter results on Thursday (Apr 24), giving Tan, who was born in Malaysia and grew up in Singapore, an opportunity to lay out more of his strategy.\n\nThough the worst of Intel\u2019s revenue declines are now behind it, according to Wall Street estimates, analysts aren\u2019t projecting a return to its previous sales levels for years, if ever.\n\nThe 65-year-old executive was hired after last year\u2019s ouster of CEO Pat Gelsinger, who struggled to execute his own turnaround bid for Intel. He had embarked on a costly effort to expand the company\u2019s factory network \u2013 and sought to turn Intel into a made-to-order chip manufacturer.\n\nBut Intel has now delayed much of its expansion effort, including plans for an Ohio facility that was once expected to become the world\u2019s largest chip production hub. Intel also had been poised to be the biggest beneficiary of money from the 2022 Chips and Science Act, but that programme is now in flux under US President Donald Trump.\n\nA manufacturing partnership with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) \u2013 the source of investor speculation in recent months \u2013 also seems less likely to happen. TSMC CEO C C Wei said last week that the company would remain focused on its own business.\n\nAlong the way, Intel missed out on the most lucrative new field for the chip industry in decades. The company, which long dominated the market for personal computer and data centre processors, was slow to respond to the shift to AI.\n\nThat upheaval allowed Nvidia to grow from a niche player into the world\u2019s most valuable semiconductor company \u2013 with revenue that now eclipses Intel\u2019s sales.\n\nGelsinger himself admitted that the company had lost its competitive spirit and expressed frustration with the speed at which it reacted to a changing market. He was not given the time he\u2019d said he would need to do something about that. Tan, in his first public appearance as CEO last month, said the turnaround would take time and would not be easy.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t happen overnight,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I know we can get there.\u201d BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Telcos, Media & Tech\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nChina clears Synopsys\u2019s US$35 billion Ansys buyout in US win\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nLG Electronics shares jump on report of AI chip gear development\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:27 AM\n\nNvidia\u2019s CEO says China\u2019s military unlikely to use US AI chips\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:47 AM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nOracle to advance Indonesia cloud services plan\n\nJul 13, 2025 02:51 PM\n\nCreative Technology warns H2 revenue may be below target, with operating loss similar to that in H1\n\nJul 11, 2025 09:09 PM\n\nJapan succession crisis fuels elevator empire 6,000% stock gain\n\nJul 11, 2025 10:24 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/d1fda83233f5dd1656fa56e07acde728f2f1e77c09e00fa07e182c856bfa60a3?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "FILE PHOTO: Intel's logo is pictured during preparations at the CeBit computer fair  at the fairground in Hanover, Germany, March 19, 2017.

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG\n\n[NEW YORK] Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi\u2019s pivot into cars has become a high-profile success story. Its SU7 is a hit, forecast to sell 350,000 units this year and even Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley has heaped praise on the model.\n\nLess well-known is how rival smartphone maker Huawei Technologies has also cemented a dominant position in China\u2019s intensely competitive electric vehicle (EV) market \u2013 not by making cars of its own, but by creating the intelligent driving software that\u2019s found its way into the cockpits of marques from BYD to BMW.\n\nIts smart driving solutions unit turned profitable last year, after revenue more than quintupled. Huawei\u2019s software does not just help sell cars to Chinese drivers who are highly attuned to intelligent driving features, it also collects vast amounts of data that may ultimately help the company crack the holy grail of autonomous driving.\n\nHuawei\u2019s \u201cbackground in hardware and software definitely shows\u201d, Tu Le, founder of Detroit-based automotive advisory firm Sino Auto Insights, said. \u201cPeople I trust tell me it\u2019s one of the best systems in China. Their aggressiveness points to how important being a player in the space is for them.\u201d\n\nIn the EV era, companies are reconfiguring how cars are designed and function. The \u201cbrains\u201d of a vehicle have a power that extends way beyond cruise control, emergency braking or parking sensors. And who gets to be in control of that is a topic sure to be high on rotation at this year\u2019s Shanghai auto show, which kicks off Wednesday (Apr 23) in China\u2019s financial capital.\n\nBut Huawei and other intelligent driving software providers are under pressure after a fatal crash involving a Xiaomi EV late last month. That\u2019s sparked a renewed focus on the claims around assisted driving technology and how such features are marketed to consumers.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nOfficials have laid out rules to avoid describing advanced driver assistance systems as \u201cself-driving\u201d and to encourage drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel while using such features, sources familiar with the matter said. The new rules could mean the roll out of upcoming smart cockpit and driver assistance systems are delayed for months.\n\nHuawei\u2019s insistence on maintaining control over its intelligent driving ecosystem also means that it\u2019s unlikely to be able to sign up customers overseas.\n\nIntelligent driving technology overlaps with issues of national security and data privacy. Western governments, especially the US, are already wary of Huawei due to its alleged ties to the Chinese government.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nHuawei readies new AI chip for mass shipment as China seeks Nvidia alternatives: sources\n\nChina\u2019s SAIC, Huawei to partner in developing new smart EVs\n\nFears that autonomous driving software, which processes real-time data from public roads, could be accessed or exploited may see countries block or restrict Huawei\u2019s technology in foreign-made cars, clouding the company\u2019s growth ambitions just as it\u2019s getting started.\n\n\u201cAs long as Huawei\u2019s solution continues to improve, they can continue to be a leader,\u201d Tu said. \u201cThe wild card is, can they convince a foreign manufacturer to use their system outside of China?\u201d\n\nAt the heart of Huawei\u2019s strategy is the Harmony Intelligent Mobility Alliance (Hima). It\u2019s a factory floor to showroom approach whereby end-user consumers can order vehicles with Huawei\u2019s software through its online stores or authorised distributors. At its most basic, Huawei just provides the hardware to automakers that facilitates smart cars.\n\nAt the auto show, several of the brands on display will be part of Huawei\u2019s alliance.\n\nThere\u2019s Aito (a partnership with Seres Group), Luxeed (in collaboration with Chery Automobile), Stelato (with Baic Motor) and Maextro (with Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group). Deliveries under the Hima framework approached 445,000 units in 2024 and Huawei has set an ambitious target of one million units across more than a dozen models in 2025.\n\nBeyond Hima, Huawei Inside has found its way into the cockpits of Audi\u2019s Q6 e-tron and A8 L models, Chongqing Changan Automobile\u2019s Deepal and Avatr ranges and even BYD\u2019s Fang Cheng Bao 8 and 5 models, even though BYD has its own suite of advanced driver-assistance systems that it calls God\u2019s Eye.\n\nBMW and Huawei meanwhile are collaborating to develop smart applications based on the Harmony operating system while Huawei\u2019s HiCar system (the company\u2019s mobile app that connects devices with vehicles) should go into made-in-China BMW models in 2026, the German automaker said last month. It noted that approximately a quarter of BMW\u2019s app users in China use Huawei smartphones.\n\nSome in the industry have chafed at Huawei\u2019s dominance. Chen Hong, the former chairman of Saic Motor, famously stated in 2021 his unwillingness to cede the \u201csoul\u201d of the vehicle to companies such as Huawei. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d Chen said during that year\u2019s shareholder\u2019s meeting. \u201cWe have to grasp the soul in our own hands.\u201d\n\nBut with the winner-takes-all nature of artificial intelligence and the high barriers of entry to producing a system that can rival Huawei\u2019s, resistance seems to be fading away.\n\nIn February, Saic announced a strategic partnership with the Shenzhen-headquartered tech giant, completing Huawei\u2019s client list so that it now covers every one of China\u2019s state-owned auto manufacturers.\n\nRepresentatives for Huawei declined to elaborate about the company\u2019s smart driving solutions and philosophy.\n\nHowever, Eric Xu, Huawei\u2019s deputy chairman, told Chinese media in September that considering not all automakers can afford the investment in smart car technology: \u201cWe will make the systems and make them well, and carmakers can use them directly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hope to build an open platform that all carmakers can participate in,\u201d Xu said. \u201cUnder these new cooperation models, carmakers and component providers are more than just in a simple buy-and-sell relationship. Instead, it\u2019s an in-depth partnership where all parties share the risks and benefits, and get things done together.\u201d BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nZuckerberg says Meta will invest hundreds of billions in superintelligence\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:48 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLinkedIn settles antitrust lawsuit, agrees to contracting changes\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:12 PM\n\nUS: Wall Street opens mixed as investors digest fresh tariff threats\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:43 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nBRC Asia secures contracts for Changi Airport Terminal 5 project worth S$570 million\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:04 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/834c183d2aa04cd69f0e21f98277de141da5c9872591e8e54578b265cd143bf8?w=180&h=120&dpr=1&f=webp", "alt_text": "Huawei Atlas 800 inference server is displayed at InnoEX Fair, in Hong Kong, China April 15, 2025.

He served as secretarial assistant to the party\u2019s Sengkang MP Louis Chua.\n\nNg, 56, became a minister soon after entering politics in GE2015 as part of the PAP\u2019s team for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC. But in GE2020, his PAP team for Sengkang GRC lost to the Workers\u2019 Party, which secured its second GRC with 52.12 per cent of the vote.\n\nJalan Kayu SMC, which has 29,628 voters, was newly carved out from Ang Mo Kio GRC this election. It includes parts of the former Sengkang West SMC, which the WP contested in the 2011 and 2015 elections.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the nomination, Low said many residents he spoke to said they felt like they were \u201cpart of the Sengkang family\u201d. He added that the WP feels \u201ca strong affinity to this place\u201d \u2013 it previously contested in the area when it used to be part of the Sengkang West SMC.\n\n\u201cSo I think we\u2019re coming home in a way,\u201d Low said.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nAs a younger Singaporean, Low said he can resonate with young voters, especially as Jalan Kayu SMC is one of the youngest constituencies in Singapore.\n\nThe product manager said some issues he will campaign about include the rising cost of living, as well as housing affordability, especially for younger residents. He also hopes to speak to the younger residents about parental leave policies and caregiver policies, and campaign for better access to facilities and amenities in the area.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking to reporters on his way out from the nomination centre, PAP\u2019s Ng said he is focused on concerns from residents over the rising cost of living, job security, and various municipal issues.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nGE2025: NTUC chief Ng Chee Meng fielded in Jalan Kayu; 2 new faces in PAP\u2019s Ang Mo Kio team\n\nGE2025: Not a \u2018consolation prize\u2019 to field former PAP opposition-ward candidates in other constituencies: SM Lee\n\nGE2025: Red Dot United steps aside from Jalan Kayu SMC, making way for WP\n\nIn response to questions about the contest against the WP, he said: \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to a fair and respecting contest.\u201d\n\nLabour chief Ng Chee Meng with supporters at Deyi Secondary School on Apr 23.

It comprises former civil servant Jasmin Lau, 41, former Aljunied GRC candidate Victor Lye, 63, and incumbent MPs Nadia Samdin, 35, and Darryl David, 54.\n\nThe PAP won Ang Mo Kio GRC in GE2020 with 71.91 per cent of the vote against the Reform Party (RP). The constituency is now Singapore\u2019s largest, with 161,499 voters.\n\nTwo members of RP\u2019s GE2020 slate are back for GE2025 \u2013 but under the banner of the SUP, which was formed by a splinter group from RP. They are SUP secretary-general Andy Zhu, 42, and Noraini Yunus, 57.\n\nRounding out SUP\u2019s slate are chairman Ridhuan Chandran, 53; flight attendant and first-time candidate Nigel Ng, 39; and Vincent Ng, 52, who contested GE2020 as part of the National Solidarity Party\u2019s slate for Tampines GRC.\n\nThe PPP\u2019s team is led by party treasurer William Lim, a limousine service provider. It comprises retired civil servant Martinn Ho, 64; construction safety coordinator Thaddeus Thomas, 43; horticulturist Heng Zheng Dao, 24; and Samuel Lee, 33, a central executive committee member.\n\nIn Kebun Baru SMC, Henry Kwek of the PAP will defend his seat against Tony Tan of the Progress Singapore Party (PSP).\n\nKwek won the SMC in GE2020 \u2013 when it was newly formed \u2013 with 62.92 per cent of votes, defeating Kumaran Pillai of the PSP.\n\nIn a thank-you speech to supporters at nomination centre Deyi Secondary, Kwek said that it has been a privilege for him to serve residents over the past decade, especially during Covid-19. He pledged to \u201cbuild what\u2019s next with courage and care\u201d.\n\nTan, 55, is married to PSP vice-chairperson Hazel Poa and co-founded SmartLab Education, a private education provider. He contested Chua Chu Kang GRC in 2011 under the NSP and has volunteered with the PSP since its founding in 2019.\n\nIn his speech, Tan said that the PSP wants a Singapore where no one is left behind and called on PAP\u2019s Kwek for a policy debate.\n\nOver in Yio Chu Kang SMC, PAP incumbent Yip Hon Weng will be up against lecturer Michael Fang, 48, of the People\u2019s Alliance for Reform \u2013 an alliance comprising RP, Peoples Voice (PV) and the Democratic Progressive Party.\n\nYip won the SMC in GE2020 with 60.82 per cent of the vote against Kayla Low of the PSP.\n\nYip said that he has stayed true to his purpose over the past five years, listening to residents concerns. He cited how Yio Chu Kang is Singapore\u2019s first dementia-friendly neighbourhood.\n\nIn GE2020, Dr Fang was part of PV\u2019s team for Jalan Besar GRC, which received 34.64 per cent of the vote.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here today to contest YCK not because I hate the PAP but because I love my country,\u201d said Fang, saying that his focus is on preserving jobs for Singaporeans and affordable healthcare.\n\nFor more election coverage, visit our\n\nGE2025 microsite\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Singapore\n\nSingapore boosts support for Timor-Leste as it prepares to join Asean\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:36 PM\n\nEconomists upgrade 2025 outlook after\u00a0\nQ2 GDP turns out better than expected\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:02 PM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nDaily Debrief: What Happened Today (Jul 14)\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:30 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nSingapore GDP up 4.3% in Q2, well above market expectations amid US tariff pause\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:00 AM", "images": [{"image_url": null, "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": null, "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/51b06805d3b24a4474858b674771c62a5eecf7271674863cd0c2a6899bb33063?w=180&h=120&dpr=1&f=webp", "alt_text": "In GE2020, labour chief Ng Chee Meng contested Sengkang GRC, but lost to the Workers' Party."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/d5d8985619db5fecdf26d88d96fb717820c1165e42d99fac78ec6f085f934230?w=180&h=120&dpr=1&f=webp", "alt_text": "SM Lee Hsien Loong (second from right) said on Saturday: \"When we field somebody as a candidate, we must make sure that we are completely convinced he is going to do his best for the residents, and is the right candidate for that place.\""}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/3b980f61514625f9f058e5c6aa42334727fa6fcf7eb30a2fb4404454a2202974?w=180&h=120&dpr=1&f=webp", "alt_text": "Red Dot United secretary-general Ravi Philemon said the decision was made after talks with WP which has also expressed interest in contesting the single-seat ward."}]}

PHOTO: YEN MENG JIIN, BT\n\n[SINGAPORE] The travails of Dasin Retail Trust (DRT) unitholders continue. From a unit price of around S$0.80 in 2020, the counter\u2019s value has practically evaporated to a paltry S$0.02 as at Apr 21, 2025. The trust\u2019s market capitalisation of around S$16 million is barely enough to buy a starter bungalow.\n\nSome of the loss in value is due to the regulatory clampdown on property financing in China, where DRT has a portfolio of retail malls, in the cities of Zhongshan, Zhuhai and Foshan. The trust also faced challenges, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nMinority investors have little reason to be drawn to DRT. Those looking for its financials will find that the latest available are the results for the six months ended Jun 30, 2023. Under the trustee-manager, Dasin Retail Trust Management, the last annual general meeting held was for FY2021.\n\nBut it is the wrangling with the trust\u2019s large unitholders that has led to the loss in shareholder value. The latest episode in this long-running drama saw the trustee-manager declare that an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) called by several dissenting unitholders was\n\n\u201cinvalid and ineffective\u201d\n\n, with any resolutions passed during the EGM void.\n\nPutting aside the merits of each side\u2019s arguments, one of the issues the DRT saga illustrates is the challenge for a listed issuer to operate when stakes are held through nominee accounts.\n\nUnder the Companies Act, a shareholder or a group of like-minded shareholders representing at least 10 per cent of the company are permitted to requisition an EGM. These provisions are similarly found in the Business Trusts Act.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nTuesday, 12 pm\n\nProperty Insights\n\nGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nAt this point in time, a group of DRT unitholders has tried three times to call for a unitholders\u2019 meeting; the unitholders involved held their stakes through nominee companies.\n\nOne of the reasons given by the trustee-manager was that the requisition notice for the EGM was not signed by the registered holders in the depository register. Therefore, how was it possible to verify that those calling for the meeting indeed held the requisite 10 per cent or more?\n\nScroll through the list of the top 20 shareholders in any annual report. Often, you\u2019ll see shareholders such as DBS Nominees or Citibank Nominees listed. These are nominee shareholders who are on record as the registered unitholder; they hold the securities on behalf of beneficial owners, who could be individuals or companies.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nTrustee-manager of Dasin Retail Trust declares notice of upcoming EGM is \u2018invalid\u2019; any resolutions passed will be void\n\nMany shareholders have valid reasons for not wanting to hold shares in their name, as opposed to holding them directly in the Singapore Exchange\u2019s (SGX) Central Depository (CDP).\n\nThis could be on account of having a private banking relationship where the bank holds all the shares on its client\u2019s behalf. It could also be due to the ease of having both the sub-depository account and the trading account with the same broker.\n\nIn 2023, there was a court case involving\n\nSGX-listed USP Group\n\n, in which the matter of beneficial shareholders seeking to requisition an EGM was raised.\n\nIn his judgment, Judicial Commissioner Goh Yihan said that looking at the relevant sections in the Securities and Futures Act, \u201cin respect of a public listed company whose shares may be held as book-entry securities through the CDP, its members are those whose names appear as account holders or depository agents in a register maintained by the CDP\u201d.\n\n\u201cMore importantly, only those who directly hold an account with the CDP (which includes the various brokerage houses in the present application) are deemed as members. Sub-account holders, such as the requisitionists, are not deemed to be members,\u201d\u00a0he added.\n\nThe judge noted that to be defined as \u201cmembers\u201d, the requisitionists could open a CDP account to hold their shares of USP Group.\n\nAn easier time as a beneficial shareholder\n\nLawyers say that there is growing awareness among nominee firms that they may need to support their clients in signing off on a requisition notice.\n\nWhile that may be the case, the way investors hold their stakes is also getting more complicated.\n\nAn overseas investor may open his or her account with a foreign nominee or custodian, who may in turn hold securities with a local nominee company.\n\nThe investor now has the difficult task of convincing two nominee companies to cooperate if he or she wishes to requisition a meeting.\n\nNominee companies are typically banks or broking firms that earn a fee for performing what they see as an administrative role. For example, they look after account-related matters, such as asking the beneficial shareholders how they want the nominee to vote as proxies at a shareholders\u2019 meeting.\n\nWhile shareholders can look at opening a CDP account to hold their stakes directly, anecdotally, the CDP will request certain know-your-client information, making it more challenging for foreign investors, particularly foreign retail investors.\n\nInvestor protection\n\nDRT has its fair share of problems. Its trustee-manager is technically insolvent, but has been able to secure a moratorium. Without an earlier EGM that could have resolved the direction of the business, affairs have dragged on. The prospects for unitholders look poor.\n\nAs Singapore strives to make the stock market more vibrant, the nominee issue may be something that needs to be addressed \u2013 by legislation perhaps \u2013 rather than by ad hoc measures.\n\nFor one, it slows down the process of calling for a shareholder meeting, which is part and parcel of how a company operates according to the Companies Act, or\u00a0how a business trust operates via the Business Trusts Act.\n\nIt can also affect how involved retail shareholders are in company matters. Increasingly, more investors are holding their stakes through nominee companies, including private banks. Transacting is much more straightforward when shares are held directly with the CDP.\n\nVoting on resolutions is possible, but there is considerably more paperwork: The company must approach the nominee bank, which then has to collate all the votes from those who do vote, and then send the information back to the company. With a tight timeframe in which to act, retail investors are likely to sit things out.\n\nInvestor protection is not just about being able to vote, but also about being able to requisition shareholder meetings in the first place, to keep the board or external manager on its toes.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\n[NEW DELHI] Shares of Indian lenders rallied to a fresh record on Tuesday (Apr 22), as the easing of liquidity rules by the central bank added to the optimism for the country\u2019s financial services sector.\n\nA gauge of the nation\u2019s top banks jumped as much as 1.2 per cent, with HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and the State Bank of India leading the winners. The Nifty Bank Index has rebounded from a nine-month low in early March, with the advance adding almost US$100 billion to the gauge\u2019s market value.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India late Monday allowed banks to allocate a smaller portion of retail deposits to sovereign bonds as a liquidity buffer, relaxing requirements in an era of mobile banking. This move is expected to improve banks\u2019 liquidity coverage ratio by 600 basis points, freeing up capital for lending.\n\nThe rally \u2013 led by private lenders \u2013 reflects growing investor confidence that the sector\u2019s credit growth is recovering from last year\u2019s slump, driven by the RBI\u2019s measures. Governor Sanjay Malhotra has eased lending rules since taking office in December, while significantly boosting banking system liquidity. This has put the sector on pace to outperform its Asian peers this month by the most since 2022.\n\n\u201cIf investors want to catch this uptick, they\u2019ll be more comfortable adding big weight to India\u2019s private banks because there is quality, they have a large weight in the index and always tend to move first,\u201d said Sat Duhra, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors.\n\nHowever, challenges remain. Most analysts expect retail credit growth to remain sluggish or in line with the overall system credit, and businesses are still wary of spending on capital formation. Also, the 50 basis points of rate cuts since February may pressure loan yields near term, as a large part of loans are tied to external benchmark rates.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nUBS resets India strategy with 360 ONE deal\n\nFor now, the robust quarterly earnings on the weekend from ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank \u2013 two of India\u2019s largest private lenders \u2013 is supporting the momentum for the sector.\u00a0 BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/165011b15229e4bf94b9ac5972f7f1753c21fded3902ef5d765b7eafcf8f34de?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "UBS will take over serving 360 ONE\u2019s clients in Singapore, subject to regulatory approvals."}]}

Beijing has responded with duties of 125 per cent on US goods.\n\nAlso contributing to downward pressure on growth in the Chinese economy are a persistent crisis in the property sector, local government debt and sluggish consumer spending.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday in its latest World Economic Outlook report that recent trends had led it to revise down a projection for global growth this year to 2.8 per cent.\n\nThat reading represents a slowdown from the estimated 3.3 per cent growth recorded last year, and is also half a percentage point lower than a previous IMF forecast in January.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThe woes have been severely compounded by a second term for US President Donald Trump, whose push to bring manufacturing back to the United States stands to hammer China\u2019s manufacturing heartlands \u2013 for decades a key driver of growth.\n\nIn view of an increasingly uncertain landscape in which \u201cdownside risks dominate\u201d, the IMF said, the Chinese economy is expected to grow four per cent this year, slower than the 4.6 per cent expansion predicted in January.\n\nGrowth next year is also now forecast to be four per cent, down from the previous projection of 4.5 per cent.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nWorld economy likely to avoid recession despite tariffs, IMF chief says\n\nThe cuts reflect doubts about the ability of the world\u2019s second-largest economy to hold up against mounting domestic pressures and hurdles for exports from the manufacturing powerhouse.\n\n\u201cFor China, the prolonged weakness in the real estate sector and its ramifications, including those for local government finances, have been key,\u201d said the IMF.\n\nThe report noted that consumer confidence in the country has not recovered since plunging in early 2022 \u2013 and said that China is among the countries most affected by Trump\u2019s recent trade blitz.\n\nBeijing has said it is targeting annual growth this year of around five per cent \u2013 the same as last year and a figure considered ambitious by many economists.\n\nData this month showed China\u2019s economy grew faster than expected in the first quarter, as exporters rushed to complete shipments before Trump\u2019s expected tariffs kicked in.\n\nAnd observers warn that the full effect of the US levies is yet to be felt, with next month\u2019s release of several key macro indicators expected to shed light on how the economy is reacting.\n\nChina last year announced a string of aggressive measures to reignite its economy, including interest rate cuts, cancelling restrictions on homebuying, hiking the debt ceiling for local governments and bolstering support for financial markets.\n\nBut after a blistering market rally last year fuelled by hopes for a long-awaited \u201cbazooka stimulus\u201d, optimism waned as authorities refrained from providing a specific figure for the bailout.\n\nAnalysts now think that the impact of tariffs may lead Beijing to reconsider its caution and push ahead with fresh stimulus.\n\nChina is far from the only major Asian economy to face the pressure of new tariffs from Trump\u2019s Washington.\n\nThe fresh levies \u2013 though most are suspended for a 90-day period to allow for negotiations \u2013 vary from 24 per cent for Japan to a whopping 46 per cent for Vietnam.\n\nIn light of the major trade turbulence, the IMF reduced its 2025 growth forecast for emerging and developing Asian economies including China by 0.6 percentage points.\n\nThe fund now anticipates a 4.5 per cent expansion in those countries this year before bouncing back slightly to 4.6 per cent next year.\n\nIndia \u2013 which has been spared from the most aggressive of Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2013 has a \u201crelatively more stable\u201d growth outlook this year, said the IMF.\n\nThe world\u2019s most populous country is forecast to chart an economic expansion of 6.2 per cent in 2025, according to the report \u2013 \u201csupported by private consumption, particularly in rural areas\u201d.\n\nThat growth rate, however, represents a 0.3 percentage point reduction from the IMF\u2019s previous forecast.\n\nJapan, a manufacturing powerhouse that relies heavily on car exports, has been hit particularly hard by the tariff war.\n\nThe IMF said Tuesday it expects economic growth of 0.6 per cent in Japan this year, dropping from the 1.1 per cent expansion it predicted in January.\n\n\u201cThe effect of tariffs announced on April 2 and associated uncertainty offset the expected strengthening of private consumption with above inflation wage growth boosting household disposable income,\u201d the IMF said.

If a US recession is land, the \u201cbirds\u201d are already swooping into view. But these sightings offer no guarantees of what lies ahead, only probabilities.\n\nAn inverted yield curve, when the long-term interest rate falls to or below the short-term rate, is commonly considered to be a predictor of recession.\n\nThe ten-year bond rate did fall below the three-month Treasury rate in March, though the two are now at about the same level. In any case, the yield curve does not actually tell us much. It simply reflects financial-market expectations that the US Federal Reserve might cut short-term interest rates in the future, which in turn reflects expectations that economic activity might falter.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nOpinion & Features\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/5b59774033eb0be8a5ea43fc06564d2cfcc26cf3f881f14d01414c1fd1268127?w=180&h=120&dpr=1&f=webp", "alt_text": "US"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/1ec9aec9a5f0a5aa086b13fc44cadf72313099457e12caf4ecfabec72e45ddbc?w=180&h=120&dpr=1&f=webp", "alt_text": "U.S. dollar banknotes are seen in this illustration taken March 19, 2025.

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG\n\n[HONG KONG] The cost to borrow the offshore renminbi in Hong Kong dropped to the lowest since data became available in 2013, putting pressure on the Chinese currency even as the US dollar weakens.\n\nThe one-month Hong Kong interbank offered rate for the renminbi \u2013 known as Hibor \u2013 dropped 11 basis points to 1.46 per cent, according to official data.\n\nThe record low rate is basically a sign of how easy it is for traders to source the Chinese currency in the city and allows them bet on further renminbi weakness. It comes amid expectations Beijing will keep liquidity ample to boost its economy and allow a managed renminbi depreciation to offset the impact of US tariffs.\n\nThe offshore renminbi slipped as much as 0.3 per cent on Tuesday (Apr 22) to around 7.31 per US dollar. It has recovered around 2 per cent from a record low hit this month.\n\nWeakness in the greenback has lessened the need for the People\u2019s Bank of China to step in to steady the renminbi. Like many global peers, the currency has benefited from a global exodus from US assets that has weighed on the US dollar.\n\n\u201cThe offshore renminbi\u2019s borrowing costs declined as the US dollar is too weak and there is no need for PBOC intervention to support the renminbi,\u201d said Ju Wang, head of greater China FX & rates strategy at BNP Paribas. \u201cA loose funding situation offshore is also helpful for China to keep a weak renminbi to counter tariff risks, rather than a strong one.\u201d\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nRecent inflows from the mainland into Hong Kong\u2019s stock market have also helped to replenish the offshore renminbi\u2019s liquidity and pushed Hibor lower, according to Ken Cheung, chief Asia FX strategist at Mizuho Bank.\n\nMainland investors purchased a net HK$14.1 billion (S$2.4 billion) of these shares on Tuesday, set for the biggest daily amount in almost two weeks. They rushed to the offshore market this month to snap up tech shares and also due to some Hong Kong stocks\u2019 cheaper pricing compared with onshore peers.\n\nThe PBOC is seen allowing the renminbi to depreciate amid escalating trade tensions with the US. The Chinese central bank guided the currency lower by cutting its daily reference rate beyond a closely watched level this month, stoking bets Beijing may weaken the renminbi even further to counter some impacts of the tariffs.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nChina\u2019s central bank asks state lenders to reduce dollar purchases: sources\n\nRenminbi starts to lead the dance in Asean\u2019s currency moves\n\nChina engineers orderly yuan drop as trade war threatens growth\n\nPBOC set to reveal hand on yuan as depreciation talk mounts\n\nYuan devaluation market chatter grows as trade war worsens\n\nPBOC starts paring yuan support amid US exceptionalism doubts\n\nMore\n\n\u201cCheap offshore renminbi funding cost corresponds with PBOC\u2019s recent onshore fixing guidance for moderate renminbi weakness,\u201d said Fiona Lim, a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Malayan Banking. \u201cDrivers such as economic pressure at home, trade conflicts and broader US dollar weakness act as counterbalancing factors to keep renminbi somewhat stable.\u201d BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCapital Markets & Currencies\n\nUS: Wall Street opens mixed as investors digest fresh tariff threats\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:43 PM\n\nDollar-selling is becoming a bubble, which may burst, HSBC says\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:03 PM\n\nFrasers Hospitality Trust\u2019s proposed privatisation by sponsor gets SGX in-principle approval\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:54 AM\n\nStocks to watch: OCBC, SGX, Centurion, Sats, Frasers Property, Frasers Hospitality Trust\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:39 AM\n\nAims Financial Group raises stake in Aims Apac Reit to 18.7%\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:35 AM\n\nUS dollar has best week since February on tariff inflation risks\n\nJul 12, 2025 11:52 AM\n\nEurope: Stocks down with bank and healthcare drag, US-EU tariffs in focus\n\nJul 12, 2025 05:56 AM\n\nUS: Stocks edge down from records amid tariff threats\n\nJul 12, 2025 05:45 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/e40d99aa792f317a0f2830432bf6a5d5a8116ca92f458926fcc4ab994122a780?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) sent the window guidance, which is its informal style for managing policy around markets, to state banks this week, asking them to withhold US dollar purchases for their proprietary accounts."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/0cc04294a572baaf980ba985b2b8f2698a582b0288936cec8296f251884ef0f1?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Movements in the broad US dollar and yuan have for some time now been critical in determining Asian foreign exchange moves, MUFG Bank\u2019s senior currency analyst Michael Wan noted that even more domestic-oriented economies, such as Indonesia, are increasingly responding more to the yuan"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/cbaf91a0c0bb627cf9cd9e90a6f0872a74e787955caebd14ba6437f5e4b87cf5?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Aside from using yuan to counter a growth slowdown, another long-term agenda may impact China\u2019s currency policy."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/86118b52f4b9185fac2d7d27b4ba504ac0c8bcc2c8f8b9d25ab40f49dff034a9?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Whether or not the central bank decides to let the yuan go now, China\u2019s financial markets look set to be challenged by high volatility."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/2f6a8bfcecb3addd37e1cc63c6d0c6ecc44006eca789eab8c9ac3d73f8ecffc5?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "China has for years been promoting the internationalisation of its yuan and sees stability \u2013 without extreme moves in either direction \u2013 as being key to further success on that front."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/83aa7b042d677a0249f4ce34899e10de9e34cd6fb03c9c08be1a3b02ada4b140?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "The PBOC has capped the yuan\u2019s drop this year to its daily reference rate, which limits moves in the onshore yuan by 2 per cent on either side."}]}

PHOTO: EPA-EFE\n\n[HO CHI MINH CITY, KUALA LUMPUR] Washington has fired another shot in the clean energy trade war with South-east Asia in the crosshairs \u2013 a move that could\n\ndim the region\u2019s standing\n\nin the global solar supply chain.\n\nThe verdict announced on Monday (Apr 21) followed a year-long investigation launched under former US president Joe Biden\u2019s administration, after American solar manufacturers raised concerns that Chinese companies were bypassing existing tariffs by\n\nshifting production to South-east Asia\n\n.\n\nFollowing\u00a0final affirmative determinations, the issuance of orders is set to take place in June. These orders usually have no fixed expiration dates but are subject to mandatory five-year reviews, said Jaehwan Lim, partner at VSE Lawyers.\n\n\u201cThe US determinations create a precedent that other countries may follow (with investigations and tariffs) \u2013 especially if their domestic solar industries can prove injury,\u201d he added.\n\nMalaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia, which have long ridden the wave of Chinese-led production to grow their domestic industries and export clout, now face painful duties running into the hundreds \u2013 and in some cases, thousands \u2013 of per cent.\n\nThis could reshape investment flows, supply chains and export priorities, potentially impacting the region\u2019s green energy goals.\n\nThe Business Times\n\nprovides a closer look at how the fallout could play out on the ground.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nFriday, 8.30 am\n\nAsean Business\n\nBusiness insights centering on South-east Asia's fast-growing economies.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nCambodia: The long-flashing warning lights\n\nCambodia solar manufacturers are staring down duties as much as 3,521.1 per cent for several China-linked companies, in a final ruling that dwarfed preliminary estimates by up to 28 times.\n\nBut pundits tell BT that solar players had already seen the writing on the wall and began restructuring supply chains well before the other shoe dropped.\n\nYana Hryshko, managing consultant and head of global solar supply chain research at energy research and consultancy group Wood Mackenzie, noted that as soon as the probe began last year, industry players in Cambodia began shifting their focus elsewhere.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nUS punishing tariffs put South-east Asian solar exporters\u2019 China Plus One strategy in a bind\n\nGreater Asean integration could prevent tariff-induced slowdown in energy transition: observers\n\nVietnam goes from potential FDI darling to trade target in Trump\u2019s trade storm\n\nUS imposes new duties on solar imports from South-east Asia\n\nMore\n\nSome companies built new manufacturing facilities within the US, while others moved to new locations such as in the Middle East \u2013 a region she describes as having high solar potential, generous government support in terms of funding, and significant energy demand.\n\nMany players also relocated their plants to other South-east Asian countries, such as Laos and Indonesia. Hryshko said it was \u201conly a matter of time\u201d before the spotlight would turn to these nations.\n\n\u201cWe joke that the solar supply chain in South-east Asia reminds us of a board game,\u201d said the Suzhou-based analyst. \u201cYou move to one cell and you get struck. Move to another cell and you get struck again.\u201d\n\nAmong its neighbours, Cambodia took the most severe blow as it had withdrawn from participating in the US-led probe. Last November, Hounen Solar \u2013 the American arm of China\u2019s Zhejiang Hounen Photoelectric \u2013 and Solar Long PV Tech Cambodia, the hardest-hit companies, said they were not able to dedicate resources to the investigation.\n\nWhen asked what the tariffs mean for the kingdom\u2019s solar scene, Hryshko said: \u201cIt means nothing\u2026 No one was going to supply from Cambodia anymore, anyway.\u201d\n\nWhile she acknowledged that the final levy was stiff, she noted: \u201cAt this point in time, it\u2019s hard for me to be surprised\u2026 and it doesn\u2019t matter because people already adjusted their supply chains to mitigate the risk.\u201d\n\nVietnam: Cracks were already showing\n\nAmong the four nations slapped with the new US duties, Vietnam exported the largest volume of solar cells to America in 2023 \u2013 12.3 gigawatts (GW) \u2013 with export value trebling since 2021 to reach US$4 billion. It now faces tariffs as much as 813.9 per cent.\n\nVietnam\u2019s solar space is dominated by foreign-owned companies, with limited participation from domestic firms. Shanghai-headquartered Jinko Solar \u2013 one of the largest international players in the market \u2013 faces a firm-specific US duty of around 245 per cent on its exports from Vietnam.\n\nThe company\u2019s photovoltaic cell factory in Vietnam began operations in October 2023 with a peak capacity of 8 GW, aimed at the US and European Union markets. But industry sources told BT the company has since slashed both its workforce and output in Vietnam due to the US tariffs.\n\nEarlier this year, First Solar \u2013 a leading American solar technology company \u2013 also decided to scale back production in Vietnam and Malaysia by a combined 1 GW, citing the uncertain US policy environment as a key reason.\n\n\u201cSince late 2024, a wave of solar cell manufacturers have been shutting down operations in Vietnam,\u201d said Do Quang Thinh, founder and chief executive of The Sunergy, a Vietnam-based renewable energy consultancy.\n\nHe noted that smaller manufacturers have ventured outside of the US for their exports, or even relocated production to countries with no solar tariffs, such as Indonesia. Meanwhile, some industrial park operators are holding back on leases to these companies, citing tariff risks and potential operational instability.\n\nBruno Jaspaert, CEO of Deep C Industrial Zones in Hai Phong, said most previously planned large solar manufacturing projects have now stalled or shifted focus to serve markets within Asia. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they can no longer exist, as there are still other markets available and the cost setup in Vietnam is still quite interesting for them,\u201d he said.\n\nGiven the rapid pace at which solar companies set up operations in South-east Asia \u2013 allegedly to circumvent US tariffs on Chinese production \u2013 industry watchers say the new anti-dumping and countervailing duties could partially paralyse the sector. But they are likely to have a limited effect on Vietnam\u2019s solar power sector, given that the majority of panels used for such projects are sourced from China.\n\n\u201cI believe that the impact of the current trade tariffs will be much bigger... Worst-case scenario, Vietnam will be hit much harder than its surrounding countries,\u201d Jaspaert said.\n\nThe new levies are set to come on top of the earlier\n\nbroad tariffs\n\nimposed by US President Donald Trump, which have already disrupted global supply chains and markets.\n\nMalaysia: Energy transition plan to the rescue\n\nAs US tariffs as much as 250 per cent push foreign solar manufacturers out of Malaysia, the country risks losing more than 5,000 jobs and a chunk of its solar export market. Yet, industry players say the resulting oversupply could accelerate Malaysia\u2019s energy transition.\n\nDavis Chong, president of the Malaysian Photovoltaic Industry Association, expects more foreign companies to scale down or relocate production outside Asean due to shrinking margins. However, local players, buoyed by domestic demand and government support under the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR), are unlikely to be impacted.\n\n\u201cThe persistent global oversupply suggests solar prices will stay low\u2026 That surplus could benefit South-east Asia\u2019s local market,\u201d he told BT.\n\nPatrick Tay, PwC Malaysia\u2019s economics and policy deals partner, said solar panels priced out of the US market will seek alternative destinations, including Malaysia. \u201cThis increased supply could potentially speed up our renewable energy transition,\u201d he added.\n\nAlthough Malaysia alone may not be able to absorb all domestically produced supply in the long-run, the intra-Asean market is sizeable and could support industry players in the region, he said.\n\n\u201c\n\nEvery megawatt that a South-east Asian country can install acts as a natural hedge against fluctuating fossil fuel commodity costs, which are US dollar-denominated, (and) would serve as a buffer against any global inflationary policies.\n\n\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nGrant Hauber, strategic energy finance adviser for Asia at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis\n\nNETR outlines Malaysia\u2019s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, with renewables making up 70 per cent of electricity generation \u2013 58 per cent of which will come from solar.\n\nDespite export headwinds, Chong said the long-term outlook for the domestic sector remains positive as the energy transition plan could create 300,000 jobs by 2050, driven largely by solar deployment.\n\nChinese companies currently dominate Malaysia\u2019s solar manufacturing, accounting for 80 per cent of its 23.6 GW capacity. Most of this is exported to the US, with the South-east Asian country\u2019s domestic\n\ninstalled capacity at only 4.2 GW\n\n.\n\nThailand: Greener pastures inwards\n\nAs the second-largest solar panel exporter and the third-largest solar cell exporter to the US by volume, Thailand is hit hard by tariffs that could be as much as 972.2 per cent following Monday\u2019s ruling.\n\nBut industry players note that displaced demand from the US opens the door to expanding the domestic use of solar products in Thailand and scaling up the regional sale of power across Asean member nations.\n\nGrant Hauber, strategic energy finance adviser for Asia at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said: \u201cThis would be advantageous for energy supply diversification, given Thailand\u2019s high dependency on natural gas (70 per cent of demand) with high exposure to global gas prices.\u201d\n\nThe energy veteran pointed out that Thailand has only about 3.3 GW of solar installed in 2024, or about 3.9 per cent of electricity supplied.\n\n\u201cSolar power is by far the cheapest source of energy (that) represents a one-time, upfront purchase cost with almost zero ongoing cost when operating,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cAs such, every megawatt that a South-east Asian country can install acts as a natural hedge against fluctuating fossil fuel commodity costs, which are US dollar-denominated, (and) would serve as a buffer against any global inflationary policies.\u201d\n\nBeyond domestic markets, opportunities lie in the regional sale of solar products within the Asean bloc as well, added Hauber, who noted that almost every member state has large renewable energy targets over the next two decades.\n\n\u201cThe region could serve as a destination market for solar manufacturing output not exported to the US, preserving plant investments and jobs.\u201d\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\n[SINGAPORE] Apple iPhones could get more expensive on any upcoming US tariffs as the tech giant passes on costs to consumers, said a Citi report.\n\n\u201cWe estimate (that) the iPhone selling price would go up 7 per cent globally if China/India total tariffs are 45 per cent/ 10 per cent, assuming another 25 per cent tariff on Apple products exported from China to the US through Section 232, and Apple (passing) all tariff costs to end customers,\u201d Citi analysts noted in an Apr 21 report.\n\nAfter US President Donald Trump announced tariffs on Apr 2 \u2013 comprising 10 per cent baseline levies for all US imports alongside steeper reciprocal tariffs for some countries \u2013 his later declaration of 125 per cent tariffs on China-made goods threatened to disrupt Apple\u2019s supply chain given its heavy reliance on China.\n\nHis subsequent declaration of tariff exemptions for smartphones, computers and other electronics from China offered brief relief for tech companies such as Apple, HP and Dell.\n\nBut on Apr 13, Trump changed course again,\n\nvowing that none would get \u201coff the hook\u201d\n\n. He said then that the exempted products would be moved to a different tariff category and that the entire electronics supply chain would be reviewed.\n\nUS officials similarly said the tariff pause was temporary, warning that exempted products would soon face fresh levies.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThe Citi report noted that the Trump administration on Apr 1 launched a Section 232 investigation on semiconductors.\n\nThe section falls under the Trade Expansion Act, which requires investigations to determine whether certain imports pose a danger to US national security before a president can tax them \u2013 investigations under this law could open the door to more tariffs.\n\n\u201cAs such, the tariff overhang on iPhones has not been removed, but simply paused,\u201d Citi analysts wrote.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nApple\u2019s historic sell-off has bulls balking from tariff risks\n\nApple production hubs hit by tariffs, sending shares plummeting\n\nNoting that there is no tariff rate cap under Section 232, they added: \u201cBased on the steel and aluminum Section 232 tariff of 25 per cent, we expect the potential Section 232 on iPhones could also be at the same level, if the Trump administration believes smartphone imports will threaten national security.\u201d\n\niPhone shipment estimates trimmed\n\nAtif Malik, Apple analyst at Citi, trimmed estimates for iPhone shipments, citing the bank\u2019s expectations that global gross domestic product growth will shrink 0.7 per cent in 2025.\n\n\u201cAs a result, iPhone shipments are expected to go down by 1 per cent in 2025 to US$226 million and slightly recover by 2 per cent to US$232 million in 2026. Despite that, we note the shipment estimate has not factored in the scenario where if Apple passes through some tariff costs to customers,\u201d the Citi report said.\n\nSales volumes could tumble even further if the tech giant passes tariff costs to its customers, it added.\n\nWhile suppliers such as Luxshare, Lens Tech and DBSJ stressed refusal to accept price cuts to share tariff costs, Citi analysts expect their profits to still be hit.\n\n\u201cAlthough we do not believe Apple suppliers would be impacted by tariffs directly, their profitability would likely be hurt given lower utilisation rates due to brands\u2019 conservative business plans amid uncertainty, operating deleverage on production disruption due to shifting US tariffs,\u201d said Citi\u2019s Kyna Wong, Kevin Chen and Karen Huang.\n\nLower shipments of Apple products could push down utilisation rates, and brands could respond to shifting tariffs by either quickly restocking or pausing orders \u2013 causing production disruptions and higher costs, they pointed out.\n\nThey noted: \u201cAndroid customers are more likely to ask for price concessions or delay upgrades amid macro uncertainty.\u201d\n\nApple\u2019s response\n\nApple shares dropped 19 per cent following the tariff announcement in a rout that saw the company lose more than\n\nUS$637 billion\n\nin market value.\n\nThe tech giant took steps to mitigate the blow, going so far as to charter cargo flights to airlift some\n\n1.5 million or 600 tonnes of iPhones\n\nto the US from India after ramping up production there. This was in an attempt to circumvent tariffs by shifting production to the South Asian nation, which faces lower levies than China.\n\nIndia faces a 26 per cent tariff rate, which is substantially lower than the 125 per cent tariff rate imposed on China \u2013 the main manufacturing hub of iPhones.\n\nDespite India\u2019s exports to the US being cheaper than China\u2019s ones after the Apr 11 tariff reprieve and the country\u2019s ambitions to produce 25 per cent of Apple\u2019s iPhones by end-2025 \u2013 up from the current 15 per cent that it makes \u2013 its production capacity is limited, Citi analysts said.\n\nThis is because it lacks capabilities to produce the Pro Max model \u2013 which accounts for a quarter of total iPhone shipments.\n\nHence, it will only be able to support 15 per cent of US iPhone sales in 2025, at most, Citi said.\n\nApple has attempted to diversify production away from China by making iPhones across a swath of manufacturing centres in other countries besides India, including Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Ireland \u2013 but even these nations were\n\nnot spared tariff wrath.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The two countries announced talks hours after Trump declared a 90-day pause on higher tariffs, which he has temporarily pared back to 10 per cent. Vietnam was facing a 46 per cent duty on products shipped to its biggest export market.\n\nVietnam has repeatedly vowed to purchase more American goods and has taken steps such as tightening measures targeting origin of goods fraud. The move is widely seen as addressing one of the Trump team\u2019s key concerns: Chinese goods being shipped to the US via Vietnam to sidestep tariffs.\n\nIn the latest push, the trade ministry revoked the right for any other organisation to issue certificates of product origin, in an effort to show it is further stepping up the fraud crackdown, news website Tien Phong reported.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nVietnam cracks down on fraud on US exports, document shows\n\nChina, Vietnam support multilateral trade regime amid US tariff pressure\n\nAsean\u2019s China trade play: buy less, sell more amid US tensions\n\nChina, Vietnam ink deals as Xi visits Hanoi amid US tariff tensions\n\nFacing Trump tariffs, Vietnam eyes crackdown on some China trade\n\nMore\n\nThe prime minister reiterated that Vietnamese goods do not compete with those of the US and that \u201cbilateral trade relations so far have ultimately benefited US consumers while driving Vietnam\u2019s export growth\u201d. Vietnam stands ready to have talks based on US suggestions, Chinh added.\n\nUnderscoring the government\u2019s push, Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry sent letters to the US Department of Commerce, the US Chamber of Commerce, the US-Asean Business Council and others to seek support in asking the US to delay the imposition of tariffs on Vietnam, according to a post on the chamber\u2019s website on Tuesday.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nAsean\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nSuspended Thailand PM Paetongtarn hit by ethics investigation, source and media say\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:07 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nMalaysia\u2019s low-key tycoon: the empire of Syed Mokhtar Albukhary\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/31fe995db10dc1c4fcf7fa6e89c9b7f174186e751a0b513f12446fd70790bcee?w=180&h=120&dpr=1&f=webp", "alt_text": "Vietnam has been slapped by the Trump administration with 46 per cent \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, currently paused until July."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/d847e5f1b2a6c2a331401ca417175b6fbeb6da4f78475ebe2ee2d4c1ccedba10?w=180&h=120&dpr=1&f=webp", "alt_text": "Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh (right) and Chinese President Xi Jinping shake hands at the Office of the Party Central Committee in Hanoi, Vietnam on Apr 14."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/5266b7e3ea22cad209f4dcb636f977d952863f1faca7414ed9910cc1f33a6af9?w=180&h=120&dpr=1&f=webp", "alt_text": "Chinese President Xi Jinping makes a three-country tour of South-east Asia from Apr 14 to 18 amid an escalating trade tensions with the US.

PHOTO: BT FILE\n\n[SINGAPORE] A resolution tabled by some unitholders of\n\nSabana Industrial Real Estate Investment Trust (Sabana Reit)\n\n, aimed at initiating a price discovery process with a view to selling the Reit\u2019s properties, failed to pass at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) held by its manager on Tuesday (Apr 22).\n\nThe resolution, which was\n\ntabled by former Sabana Reit director Charlie Chan\n\nand other unitholders, garnered 42.84 per cent or 288,170,736 of the total number of votes cast by unitholders. This was less than half the votes required to pass the resolution.\n\nTwo other related resolutions also failed to pass at the EGM, which was held at New Tech Park in Lorong Chuan.\n\nThe EGM was convened after Chan, a former independent non-executive director, and other unitholders who collectively own about 20 per cent of the trust\u2019s units, submitted a requisition notice to the manager in January this year.\n\nThey sought to pass three resolutions.\n\nThe first asked for trustee HSBC Institutional Trust Services (Singapore) and the manager to commence and undertake a price discovery process, with a view of \u201cachieving a possible sale of all or (the) majority\u201d of the Reit\u2019s assets.\n\nBT in your inbox\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\nThe requisitionists also requested that the trustee and/or manager appoint an \u201cinternationally reputable\u201d firm of property consultants \u201cwith a track record\u201d of selling Singapore industrial properties to oversee the price discovery process.\n\nLastly, they asked Sabana Reit\u2019s trustee and manager to complete the price discovery process within three months from the passing of the resolutions.\n\nThe unitholders called for the EGM as they believed \u201csignificant costs\u201d have been and continue to be incurred by the Reit in relation to the\n\ninternalisation process of the manager\n\n.

This was despite S$11.8 million being spent on the internalisation process.\n\nHe noted that other Reits have been able to sell their assets above valuation and suggested that Sabana Reit\u2019s manager find out how much the buildings are \u201creally worth\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf I find that some people are willing to pay us close to book value\u2026 we can consider whether we want to sell (the assets), as opposed to going through internalisation,\u201d he said.\n\nHe questioned if a change of the Reit manager via the internalisation process would truly help to increase the trust\u2019s book value, which is currently trading at a discount of around 25 per cent.\n\nIn response, Havard Chi, who is the research head of activist investor Quarz Capital which initiated the internalisation process at\n\nSabana Reit\n\n, said the disposal of non-core assets will be \u201cone of the key strategies\u201d to unlock value for unitholders once the elected directors of the internalised manager are officially appointed.\n\nIn its latest\n\nQ1 financial results\n\non Apr 15, Sabana Reit posted a distribution per unit of S$0.0086 for the quarter ended Mar 31, up 26.5 per cent from S$0.0068 in the same period the year before.\n\nThis came on the back of 27 per cent higher distributable income, which stood at S$9.8 million at the end of the period, led by higher net property income and partially offset by higher finance costs.\n\nUnits of Sabana Reit were trading flat at S$0.355 as of 1.30 pm on Tuesday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\n[SAN JOSE] JPMorgan Chase is expanding its San Francisco office and committing its marquee healthcare conference to the city for another year, offering a boost to Mayor Daniel Lurie\u2019s effort to revitalise the downtown.\n\nThe bank plans to increase the leased space at its main San Francisco office by roughly 30 per cent to 280,000 square feet, making it a local headquarters for more than 1,600 employees, according to a statement on Monday (Apr 21). The building, 560 Mission St, will undergo a renovation and be renamed JPMorganChase Center.\n\nJPMorgan also will maintain 125,000 square feet of space at a building it acquired in its 2023 purchase of First Republic Bank. In addition, the company committed US$3.8 million towards philanthropic efforts to support the city\u2019s downtown economy.\n\nSan Francisco has struggled more than other areas to recover from the pandemic, leaving office vacancies near record highs and hurting tax revenue. Lurie, who took office in January, has courted the city\u2019s largest business interests to spur investment in the downtown core and restore its reputation as a finance and tech hub.\n\nJPMorgan chief executive officer Jamie Dimon met with Lurie in January during the bank\u2019s annual healthcare conference, one of the city\u2019s largest conventions. The mayor has also met with Wall Street executives including Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon and Blackstone president Jon Gray, his calendar records show.\n\nAs part of its announcement on Monday, JPMorgan said its healthcare conference will return to San Francisco in 2026. While the event draws thousands of people each year, complaints about the city\u2019s high costs and lack of space have often spurred speculation it will move to another location.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU\n\nTuesday, 12 pm\n\nProperty Insights\n\nGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.\n\nSign Up\n\nSign Up\n\n\u201cSan Francisco is a key growth market for JPMorgan Chase and we have been hard at work with local leaders, partners, and clients to understand how we can best deploy our resources and expertise to power continued economic growth across the city,\u201d Tim Berry, the bank\u2019s global head of corporate responsibility, said.\n\nThe downtown is key to San Francisco\u2019s economic health.
