And it plans to purchase additional facilities in the coming six months, aiming at listing shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Reit Securities Market this autumn after exponentially increasing its asset value and securitizing the real estate.\n\nOffice buildings and rental apartment buildings, properties for which asset valuation is easy, have been the main targets of Reits. It was believed that care facilities for the elderly would be difficult to make into investment targets as their profits are affected by their management companies' ability.\n\nSuch management companies are faced with the problem of either borrowing money for maintenance from banks or relying on their own funds.\n\nThe demand for care facilities for the elderly is certain to increase in the future, and it will be necessary to collect funds widely for their maintenance.\n\nJapan's Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Ministry has compiled guidelines that call for experts in the nursing care industry to serve in an advisory capacity so management companies can accurately judge the business conditions of facilities. The ministry plans to announce formal guidelines by June.\n\nIn preparation for the Reit listings, the Tokyo Stock Exchange plans to revise its rules on the information that must be disclosed to investors after the listing. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nChina\u2019s June new home prices fall at fastest monthly pace in eight months\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n4\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\n5\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal", "images": []}

Brunch from 11am to 3pm Sat and Sun. Closed on Monday\n\nWHEN you were young and mischievous, did your parents ever tell you to stop playing around and just grow up?\n\nSomeone must have said the same thing to Keong Saik Snacks - which has traded in its playful demeanour and frivolous menu of hot dogs and lobster rolls for a more mature vibe as reflected in its new name, The Study. It's meant to complement its sister bar The Library, but The Study has a more bookish approach to its food, with a menu that kicks off like a school text: An Introduction to British Cooking. And who better to helm the lesson but consultant Brit chef Jason Atherton, who has put his name to this and other gastro-spots in Singapore such as Esquina and Pollen.\n\nImpressive vintage tomes on the wall-mounted bookshelves aside, it's hard to put your finger on exactly what The Study is. Visually, the original diner concept was perfect for the tiny space with its cramped tables and young, anything-goes vibe that was a bigger draw than the fact that it didn't serve \"real\" food. Now that it's attempting a bit more gravitas, the same cramped space and well-worn red banquette doesn't quite have the same cool factor.\n\nPerhaps, it's better at night when it's darker, you see less, and The Study becomes a more logical dining extension of The Library. It's a different story in the daytime though, when the bar is dead and every little detail is up for scrutiny. You end up wondering: Does swopping squeezy ketchup and mustard bottles for wine glasses make a snack bar grow up?\n\nThis is one time where substance trumps style, because The Study offers a well-curated roster of English grub classics (and Italian influences) at manageable prices. Especially at lunch time, when its three-course $35 set is a steal considering it comprises many of the same dishes on the a la carte menu.\n\nOn the day of our visit, a simple but refreshing heirloom tomato salad is generous in both firm, chunky tomato wedges and the creamy pesto dressing they're tossed in, with pine nuts for added crunch. Nothing groundbreaking but the simple pesto has the requisite balance of oil, cheese and herbs that add enough seasoning and contrast against the mild tomatoes.\n\nA better choice would be the crunchy grilled asparagus arranged over crunchy, sweet shredded beetroot and creamy-chewy burrata, everything bound together by a discreet hazelnut dressing. Nothing jars this harmonious medley of crunch, sweetness and mellow creamy mouth feel, topped off by an airy, whisper-thin crispbread.\n\nThe day's special of scotch egg ($18) is a picture-perfect runny-yolked, hard-boiled egg encased in sausage meat and deep-fried, and would have tasted perfect if not for the unexpected vinegary tang in the minced meat mixture.\n\nFor the mains, the ugliest-looking dish turns out to be the best: beautifully braised ox cheek ($32 on the a la carte menu but which is part of the set lunch) in full gelatinous glory paired with tender tongue that retains a firm but yielding bite, on smooth potato mash. Less successful is the fried snapper used in the fish and chips, with a dry and stringy texture which doesn't do justice to the light crisp batter. The $30 a la carte version comes with duck fat chips but our set lunch version makes do with skinny fries. A side portion of the duck fat chips ($9) is a must, though. The fowl's fat sure makes a difference in boosting the flavour and texture of the tender, mealy wedges.\n\nAlso getting short shrift is the roast pork belly and braised pork cheek ($32) - glistening chunks of wobbly fat, tender meat and nicely broiled skin that's so salty it's as if a kitchen assistant accidentally knocked over the salt container when the chef wasn't looking. A shame, since it would have tasted so good with the right seasoning, along with the also over-salted white bean cassoulet. We wouldn't miss the pork cheek if the assistant nicks it the next time, though.\n\nDespite the ifs and buts of the savoury section, desserts are faultless all the way through. From the light puffballs that are cinnamon, sugar-dusted doughnuts served with caramel cream ($13) to the perfect moist-crisp, cakey Bakewell tart with sour cherries and the predictable but comforting chocolate lava cake, you really do need room for these.\n\nA dessert bar could well be its fallback should The Study fail its current test, but going by its strong foundation, we think it deserves more than a passing grade.\n\njaime@sph.com.sg\n\nRating:\n\n7\n\nWHAT OUR RATINGS MEAN\n\n10: The ultimate dining experience\n\n9-9.5: Sublime\n\n8-8.5: Excellent\n\n7-7.5: Good to very good\n\n6-6.5: Promising\n\n5-5.5: Average\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Analysts believe he is prepared to bite the bullet this time.\n\nAlready, greater efforts have been made to inform and educate the public on the benefits of the tax which will replace the current sales and services tax, levied at 10 and 6 per cent, respectively.\n\nGovernment officials have stated that the GST needs to be introduced at a minimum of 6 per cent for the tax to be meaningful, with projected annual returns of about RM30 billion (S$11.58 billion). They have also been quick to point out that some 160 countries already have GST and that the proposed rate is one of the lowest in the region, and assured that essential items will be tax exempt or zero-rated.\n\nMoreover, cash handouts to lower income households will be continued.\n\nEven so, the impact of the GST cannot be denied. Economists expect inflation to rise significantly from an estimated 3.2 per cent this year to as much as 5 per cent next year.\n\nWith a year to its proposed introduction, there are expectations of an uptick in consumption in the months leading to April next year.\n\nIn Japan for instance, shoppers reportedly rushed to fill trolley-loads of goods - including gold - ahead of a 3 per cent rise in the sales tax to 8 per cent.\n\nThere could be a flurry of interest in even bigger items. In Malaysia, despite softer market conditions, property players expect transactions to pick up in the second half of the year.\n\nAlthough residential properties will be tax exempt, new home prices are still expected to rise, according to a Penang developer, by an estimated 5 per cent.\n\nThe draft GST Bill is said to be 187 pages long. It has to go through three readings in the House of Representatives before being passed to the Senate for approval.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Some had travelled from as far as Australia, the Netherlands and Switzerland just to be part of the festivities.\n\nThis was the seventh time that the government's Overseas Singapore Unit and its partners have organised the reunion party. The day-long event is held at cities where there are significant numbers of Singaporeans.\n\nThe first Singapore Day was staged at New York's Central Park in 2007, and it has since travelled to Melbourne (2008), London (2009), Shanghai (2011), New York (2012) and Sydney (2013).\n\nMs Fu let on that next year's edition could be an extra special one, given that it would take place in the same year as Singapore's Golden Jubilee. \"Right now, we're still going on a tour around the world, looking at where we have a good concentration (of Singaporeans). We hope that, maybe for 2015, we can do something special. We will look at that,\" she said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Not only are PCs and mobile devices getting networked, even common household items such as TVs and refrigerators as well as vehicles are getting linked to the World Wide Web.\n\nWhile this opens up a world of opportunities for manufacturers and service providers in terms of delivering yet more innovative devices and tools, it also opens up the possibility of more avenues by which hackers can target their victims, said Marco Balduzzi, senior threat researcher at Trend Micro's global forward looking threat research team.\n\nIn an interview with BizIT, Mr Balduzzi said the security landscape for IoT, also referred to as machine-to-machine (M2M) communications, is similar to that of mobile devices some five years ago. At that time, nobody gave much attention to mobile malware since smartphones were only just emerging and most of the mobile phones used were the feature phone variety with limited online access, if any, he noted.\n\nHowever, the security threat posed by seemingly innocuous non-PC devices such as smart TVs, networking gear and Web-enabled vehicles is real and present, the researcher said.\n\nAccording to a study by security firm Proofpoint released this January, more than 750,000 malicious emails from a recent cyberattack campaign originated from devices that were not conventional laptop or desktop computers. Between Dec 23, 2013 and Jan 6, 2014, spam was sent from compromised routers or network-accessed storage, connected multimedia centres, TVs and at least one refrigerator, it stated in a press release.\n\nOne reason why these connected devices are susceptible to hacking is because of inherent vulnerabilities in the various communication protocols used today. These include Bluetooth, WiFi and GSM, said Mr Balduzzi.\n\n\"There is a lack of defined guidelines for using these protocols (in non-conventional connected devices) and no one is enforcing the implementation by electronics manufacturers,\" he said. Connectivity is now being included in watches and even eyeglasses.\n\nAs such, the threat situation is \"very fluid\" and the entire environment is open to attacks although he expects more clarity on the security landscape in six to 12 months.\n\nAs far as motivation is concerned, financial and corporate espionage remains the main driver for hackers, said Ruben Martin Mondejar Jr, technical support manager at Trend Micro Singapore. Based on conversations with existing corporate customers, he said spear phishing and zero-day attacks continue to be the attack methods of choice for cybercriminals targeting businesses in Asia-Pacific.\n\nSpear phishing targets a specific organisation or executives within the company and sends spam emails to entice the user to click on the infected URL link in order to gain access to sensitive information about the person or corporation. Zero-day attacks are those that exploit unknown vulnerabilities in existing applications. For instance, Mr Mondejar pointed out there was a number of spear phishing attacks recently based on the missing Malaysian Airlines plane MH370 to get people to click on the malicious link, given the heightened public attention on the unfolding situation.\n\nThis is why user education continues to be something both Trend Micro executives advise companies to beef up on, as employees remain the weakest link in any corporation's IT security environment.\n\nMr Balduzzi said: \"Companies are still cutting costs on security training for employees (despite an increasingly challenging landscape), but they need to instead invest more in their people.\"\n\nAccounting firm KPMG has cottoned on to this industry need, having launched its Cyber Security Centre (CSC) in January 2014. With the CSC, it hopes to empower and boost companies' cyber defence capabilities.\n\nLyon Poh, partner and head of IT assurance and security at KPMG Singapore, said then that many existing cyber security programmes focus on implementing preventive measures, but these do not adequately address the targeted and determined nature of today's attackers.\n\n\"The CSC will focus on equipping cyber security professionals in organisations with the right skills to enhance their situational awareness so that they can detect threats early and respond in a robust manner. We will also work closely with participating companies to develop security proof-of-concepts relevant to their business situation,\" said Mr Poh.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The report comes as \"tapering\" of monetary easing by the US Federal Reserve gets under way, threatening to destabilise global capital flows. \"Investors' tendency to mimic each other's choices, known as herding behaviour, has not declined,\" it noted.\n\nThe composition of global investors in emerging markets has changed over the past 15 years, making capital flows more sensitive to global financial shocks but policies to deepen emerging market financial systems can help manage risk, the report suggested. \"Knowing who the investors are is critical for understanding stability of capital flows into emerging markets, especially when uncertainty over advanced economies' monetary policy remains high,\" said Gaston Gelos, an official in the IMF's Monetary and Capital Markets Department.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Now under new management, American is trying to bounce back from years of under-investment and market share losses, drawing from its recent merger with US Airways.\n\nThe New York-London route is popular with Wall Street executives who are willing to pay for the priciest seats and who often travel at the last minute. Eager for their business, airlines are using their best planes on the route and investing in upgrades such as satellite Wi-Fi and seats that turn into flat beds.\n\nThe alliances provide more flights under one banner, and better links to other US and European cities. That convenience can win over corporate accounts, locking in business travellers. \"This is a battle royale,\" said George Hamlin, an aviation consultant in Fairfax, Virginia. \"This is about who gets the greatest number of the passengers who pay the most money.\"\n\nAmerican and joint venture partner British Airways have an estimated 59 per cent share of seats flown between the US and London's Heathrow, compared with about 24 per cent for Delta and Virgin, and United Continental's 14 per cent share, according to a US government filing by Delta and Virgin.\n\nLondon is the top international destination from New York and business class fares can reach into the thousands of dollars, making the route one of the most profitable. For example, the highest possible business class fare between JFK airport and Heathrow on any given day is about US$18,200 round trip, according to Nick Fleetwood, a manager at Cook Travel.\n\nWhile the airlines don't disclose New York-London revenue, their Atlantic routes, which include destinations other than London, account for significant income. Delta's passenger revenue from Atlantic service rose 3 per cent to US$5.7 billion last year, and the region supplied about 15 per cent of its operating revenue. American's 2013 Atlantic revenue rose 10 per cent to US$3.8 billion, accounting for about 14 per cent of overall revenue.\n\nDelta says that corporate customer interest has increased since its Virgin venture formally began in January. While Virgin's hip image and planes fitted with mood lighting and futuristic bars are part of the lure, Delta is also aiming to win business travellers who previously shunned it because of its weak schedule to Heathrow.\n\nDelta offered just three nonstop daily flights between JFK airport and Heathrow before the tie-up. Starting this month, its venture with Virgin will operate nine nonstops between the New York area and London, and aim for flight times that are more convenient for business travellers.\n\nThat compares with 17 daily flights between the New York area and London from American Airlines and British Airways.\n\nDelta-Virgin customers will also have greater choice flying to London from other parts of the US as the two airlines fill holes in each other's route maps.\n\n\"Delta prior to this merger was a player but not to the extent that it will be able to compete now,\" said Goran Gligorovic, executive vice-president with Omega World Travel, an agency that handles corporate contracts with airlines. \"The more reach an airline has, either with alliances, code-shares or its own service, the more interesting partner it becomes for any corporation,\" he said.\n\nAmerican must work through labour problems, complete gate divestitures and meld computer systems following its exit from bankruptcy and merger with US Airways last year. Now the world's largest carrier by traffic, American will refresh its fleet with hundreds of new planes.\n\nAmerican has put its flagship aircraft on the New York to London route: a new extended range Boeing 777-300 that has separate cabins for first and business class with fully reclining seats, as well as coach seats with power outlets and USB jacks.- Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

Not just because of its fund-raising capability, but also its investment function. But the performance of the Singapore bourse has raised concerns within local financial circles, and here's why:\n\nThe average value of shares traded on the Singapore bourse has fallen 40 per cent to about S$1.06 billion in the first two months of this year from S$1.77 billion a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This compares unfavourably to the 11 per cent fall in transactions in Hong Kong in the same period, while those on Japan's Topix index increased 17 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, the benchmark Straits Times Index has trailed its major developed-market peers in the past 12 months and has been flat this year. The total return on the FTSE ST All-Share Index is down 2.5 per cent year on year. And despite numerous initial public offerings, the market capitalisation of the Singapore bourse is down almost 4 per cent year on year. This is despite Singapore Exchange's (SGX) attempts to boost market activity via measures such as extended trading hours and the move to encourage more retail investor participation. All this has also been bad news for the people at the epicentre of the market - stockbrokers.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Many relatives of those on board have been incensed at the announcement on March 24 by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak that - based on detailed analysis of satellite data - the plane could be presumed lost at sea.\n\nBut Mr Abbott said he agreed with Mr Najib's conclusions.\n\n\"The accumulation of evidence is that the aircraft has been lost and it has been lost somewhere in the south of the Indian Ocean,\" he told reporters at the Perth military base coordinating the search. \"That's the absolutely overwhelming wave of evidence and I think that Prime Minister Najib Razak was perfectly entitled to come to that conclusion, and I think once that conclusion had been arrived at, it was his duty to make that conclusion public.\"\n\nMr Abbot also gave his assurance that the hunt for the plane had no time limit, despite the failure of an international operation to find any sign of the plane.\n\nA total of 20 aircraft and ships were again scouring a massive area in the Indian Ocean some 2,000km west of Perth, where investigators believe the Boeing 777-200ER carrying 239 people came down.\n\n\"I'm certainly not putting a time limit on it,\" Mr Abbott told reporters after meeting flight crews at Pearce airbase in Perth.\n\n\"The intensity of our search and the magnitude of our operations is increasing, not decreasing,\" he said, adding that searchers owed it to grieving families of passengers to continue the hunt.\n\nDozens of items have been spotted since the Australian authorities moved the search 1,100km north after new analysis of radar and satellite data, but none has been linked to Flight MH370.\n\nSome families have strongly criticised Malaysia's handling of the search and investigation, including the decision last week to say that the plane had ended its journey in the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nMr Najib will travel to the western Australian city of Perth, the base for the search, tomorrow to see the operations first-hand, Malaysia's government said.\n\nMalaysia says the plane was likely diverted deliberately far off course. Investigators have determined no apparent motive or other red flags among the 227 passengers or the 12 crew.\n\nChina has also been critical in Malaysia's handling of the case, but in a sign of softening, the official China Daily said it was understandable that not all sensitive information could be made public.\n\n\"Although the Malaysian government's handling of the crisis has been quite clumsy, we need to understand that this is perhaps the most bizarre incident in Asia civil aviation history,\" the editorial yesterday read.\n\n\"Public opinion should not blame the Malaysian authorities for deliberately covering up information in the absence of hard evidence.\" - AFP, Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

Deliveries are expected to grow by 11.8 per cent annually over the next three years, Standard Chartered said, citing data provider Ascend.\n\n\"Demand is that strong within our footprint of Asia, Africa and the Middle East,\" Mr Perkins said.\n\n\"Of the global order book for commercial jets, about 35 to 45 per cent is from the Middle East and Asia,\" he added.\n\nStandard Chartered is in talks with Qatar Aviation Lease to lease eight Airbus A320 planes that will be sub-leased to Pakistan International Airlines, Mr Perkins said.\n\nAlmost a quarter of the bank's aviation assets are in the Middle East.\n\nEmirates, the world's biggest airline by international passenger traffic, is seeking to raise about US$2 billion from four loans to fund plane purchases, two people familiar with the transaction said on March 13.\n\nEtihad, the Abu Dhabi state-owned carrier, has sought three loan proposals from banks that may raise about US$750 million to help pay for 10 Airbus and Boeing planes, three people familiar with the deals said last week.\n\nBanks funded between 25 per cent to 30 per cent of total global aircraft financing last year.\n\nThat share may rise slightly this year as lenders are cash-rich and interest rates on loans have declined by as much as a percentage point over the last 18 months, Mr Perkins said.\n\nExport credit agency financing fell to about 23 per cent last year from a third earlier and may fall further this year, he said.\n\n\"The aviation business is very strongly correlated with economic growth,\" Mr Perkins said.

The usual effects-driven set pieces and action-movie heroics - plus a comic book-worthy villain - are all in place, but our star-spangled hero also has more than his fair share of opaque political clutter to rummage through.\n\nThat means the poor Captain, an old-fashioned good guy newly-installed in a different world, is possibly out of his depth, what with an array of spies, assassins and most deadly of all - politicians - to contend with. But then again, anyone with his own museum exhibition (at The Smithsonian, no less) should possess the wherewithal to navigate his way through Washington DC - where friend and foe often turns out to be the same person.\n\nThe last time we saw Captain America (in his own movie, anyway), he had emerged from a deep freeze as Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a World War II-era weakling-turned-super soldier and the Allied answer to the Nazi threat of world domination. This time around, he's an integral member of Shield, the covert law-enforcement government agency run by Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson), battling a more shadowy enemy.\n\nWhen security at Shield is badly compromised, Rogers and fellow agent Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) find themselves on the run, pursued by a gang of killers from their own agency. The world has changed but Rogers remains steadfastly pure: a man of justice and a novice at kissing. He might have old-world values but on the plus side, he looks great for a 95-year-old.\n\nFury's colleague at the agency and World Security Council member Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) is intent on launching a trio of heavily armed airborne aircraft carriers to police the nation. He also has a habit of giving ominous speeches about sacrificing freedoms in return for security - a conservative view that betrays a hidden agenda.\n\nRogers gets a new wingman (literally) in the shape of Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), and then an old foe and an old friend from Rogers' past also show up (in altered states), adding to the intrigue and further colouring our hero's once-simple stand of good-versus-evil. There's plenty of comics-style gunfire, close-quarter combat and shield-slinging to satisfy the fans, but the film is also up to date with its views on national security and US foreign policy.\n\nThe Winter Soldier, directed by brother duo Joe Russo and Anthony Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (who also penned the first Captain America script) is overly long and a tad darker than the average Marvel blockbuster, but the high-tech gadgetry, light-hearted banter and effects-laden action will overcome the urge to take any of this too seriously. When the end credits roll and the obligatory post-credits scene has taken place, there's nothing for it but to wait a couple of years for the next instalment to arrive.\n\nRating:\n\nC+\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The actual rate hinges on a cash flow range from $7,500 to $20,000 and above.\n\nParticipating customers will earn higher interest rates on the first $50,000 under the new programme, with no lock-in period. The remaining balances above $50,000 will be subject to prevailing interest rates.\n\n\"More than 27 per cent of working residents in Singapore have a gross monthly income of over $5,000 and spend around $1,500 on credit cards each month. Along with an average monthly mortgage repayment of $1,150 for a four-room HDB flat, this group would be eligible for the tiered interest rate of 0.98 per cent,\" said DBS.\n\nAccording to a recent DBS survey of more than 1,000 respondents, emerging affluent between the ages of 30-59, and with a monthly income of $5,000 and above, allocate around 29 per cent of their income to savings, 30 per cent to loans and investments, and 25 per cent to expenses.\n\n\"Based on existing cash flows, hundreds of thousands of customers already qualify for higher interest rates under this programme,\" DBS said, adding that more than 1,000 customers signed up for it during the two-month pilot at the start of the year.\n\nSharon Tan, DBS' senior vice-president of Consumer Banking Group Customer Management said: \"We want to help our customers maximise their funds and grow their wealth in a smarter way. In a mature banking sector such as Singapore, it is important to adopt a holistic approach, innovate and deliver products or services that place customers at the heart of the banking experience.\n\n\"By consolidating their cash flows with us, customers can better review their monthly finances and benefit from the stronger banking relationship.\"\n\nDBS said that customers can sign up for the programme via DBS iBanking, through online submission or at DBS/POSB branches.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Companies including retailers such as Macy's Inc are waiting for the weather to improve to get a clearer picture of the economy's health.\n\n\"The underlying strength in the economy is reasonably good, and was accelerating before we had the bad weather,\" David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance in Columbus, Ohio, said before the report. \"Once we get past the first quarter and we get a real GDP reading, in the second quarter we should see a rebound.\"\n\nYesterday's estimate is the third and final for the quarter. For all of 2013, the economy expanded 1.9 per cent after a 2.8 per cent increase in the prior year.\n\nConsumer purchases, which account for almost 70 per cent of the economy, advanced at a 3.3 per cent in the fourth quarter, the most since the last three months of 2010 and surpassing the 2.6 per cent gain previously reported, according to yesterday's Commerce Department report.\n\nIt added 2.2 percentage points to growth from October till December and followed a 2 per cent advance in the prior three-month period.\n\nHousehold outlays on services climbed at a 3.5 per cent annualised rate, the biggest gain since the second quarter of 2005.\n\nThe revision from the prior estimate of 2.2 per cent reflected gains in health care, financial services and electricity.\n\nSales at US retailers rose in February for the first time in three months, the Commerce Department reported earlier this month, a sign that consumer spending might be regaining traction. Purchases increased at department stores, sporting goods retailers and Internet merchants.\n\nThe job market is showing signs of thawing. Payrolls rose more than projected in February, with employers adding 175,000 workers, the Labor Department reported earlier this month.\n\nUnemployment climbed to 6.7 per cent from a five-year low of 6.6 per cent the prior month.\n\nAbnormally cold weather probably slowed fourth-quarter growth by 0.4 points and is expected to shave a full percentage point from first-quarter GDP, according to an analysis from Macroeconomic Advisers in St Louis.\n\nIn addition to cold and snow, the economy in the first quarter of 2014 has been challenged by expiring unemployment aid for 1.3 million job-seekers, which probably led to a slowdown in spending, and the loss of dozens of corporate tax breaks.\n\nYesterday's report for the first time included a measure of corporate profits. Before-tax earnings rose 2.2 per cent after climbing 1.9 per cent in the prior period. Profits were up 6.2 per cent from the end of 2012.\n\nPrice pressures remain muted. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, inflation tied to consumer spending patterns climbed at a 1.3 per cent annualised rate in the fourth quarter, compared with a 1.4 per cent gain in the prior three months.\n\nIt has fallen short of Federal Reserve policymakers' 2 per cent goal for the past seven quarters. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

We cannot just sit there and wait,\" said the association's chairman, Ng Cheng Thye.\n\n\"(But) if there's nothing concrete, we won't say anything at this stage.\"\n\nAs gold prices tumbled 28 per cent last year, gold trade flows shifted dramatically, with gold leaving the traditional hubs of London and Geneva to be re-cast into one-kilogramme bars and shipped into Asia.\n\nChina consumed 1,120 tonnes in jewellery, bars and coins last year, compared with 848 tonnes in 2012, according to the World Gold Council.\n\nIndia's consumption rose 13 per cent to 975 tonnes in spite of measures introduced to limit gold demand, as more gold was smuggled into the country.\n\nIf SGX's plans to launch gold futures come to fruition, it will join South Korea and China in offering physical bullion deliveries.\n\nKorea Exchange, which has had bullion futures since 1999, started offering physical gold trades earlier this week.\n\nThe Shanghai gold exchange, set up in 2002 and under the jurisdiction of the central bank, handles physical gold deliveries as China's largest bullion bourse.\n\nOther exchanges have tried and failed with gold futures contracts.\n\nThe Hong Kong Mercantile Exchange, which traded US dollar-denominated gold futures contracts, wound up in May last year, while the Singapore Mercantile Exchange, which had a gold futures contract based on Indian gold prices, was bought over by US-based IntercontinentalExchange in a US$150 million deal late last year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So when Canadian Edward Burtynsky was looking for his angle, he picked Man's impact on the landscape instead. \"It's focusing the lenses on human systems we've put into the landscape,\" he explains, adding that he knew he wanted to photograph nature, but he wished to do it with a difference. \"Most of my work is to connect us, humans, to the landscape. That's the thesis.\"\n\nIt's easy now to see Burtynsky's photographs through the filters of environmentalism, but when he started 30 years ago, the view towards our land and nature was very different, he recalls. \"The idea of global warming, that we could fish out our oceans, or run out of petrol, for instance, just wasn't part of the discussion.\"\n\nBurtynsky began with mines - iron, silver, nickel - and the impact of mining activity on the landscape, such as railtracks in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, in the 1980s. From mines, he went on to photograph quarries in North America to Europe. Then it was oil refineries and oil fields, a trail which brought him to Asia where he photographed ship-breaking work in Bangladesh by early 2000. \"That was the game-changer for me,\" he says, as the images he took of Bangladeshis breaking up old ships practically with their bare hands, and carrying all that steel on their shoulders, got him noticed. \"I was probably the first artist to bring those images to the West.\"\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The decision was a sign that US President Barack Obama has succeeded in forming a united front with the leaders of six allied nations (Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan) against what they regard as Russia's violation of international law with the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula this month.\n\nMr Obama and the leaders agreed to boycott a planned G-8 summit meeting in Sochi, Russia in June, and instead to convene as the G-7 in Brussels. The Western governments were also planning to offer a package of economic and financial support for Ukraine's new pro-Western government, which took power in February after a protest movement ousted pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych. The United States has already adopted sanctions against members of Russia's political and economic leadership. But members of the G-7 such as Germany, which have close trade and investment ties with Russia, are understandably less inclined to adopt tighter sanctions against segments of the Russian economy, including its energy and banking sectors.\n\nBut if Russia decides to pursue new aggressive moves, such as deploying troops in eastern Ukraine, the Western leaders are expected to move towards more punishing economic steps against Moscow, although neither the US nor its allies are considering the use of military force against the Russians under any scenario, barring a direct attack on a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Fortunately, first-time director Ritesh Batra displays an assured touch as well as a sense of restraint with this film about a case of mistaken lunchbox identity and the unlikely relationship that sprouts from it.\n\nThe movie's promise is deceptively simple yet entirely appropriate to its setting: the urban chaos of Mumbai and more specifically its unique food delivery system starring the city's dabbawallas - people who collect tiffin carriers of cooked food from homes for delivery to office workers throughout the city, using various modes of transport. The system, which has apparently come under the scrutiny of researchers from Harvard, ensures that each lunchbox reaches its intended recipient and also includes the safe return of empty containers.\n\nIn The Lunchbox however, a mistake is made when Ila (Nimrat Kaur), a neglected young housewife, cooks up a delicious lunch for her husband Rajeev (Nakul Vaid) - only for it to be delivered instead to Saajan (Irrfan Khan), an aloof widower and scrupulously tidy government employee who has worked in the same department for 35 years.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's a reminder that panic and rumours can quickly spread. The solution is to draw a clearer line between what's protected and what isn't.\n\nChina is one of the few big countries that does not offer explicit insurance to bank depositors - along with Saudi Arabia and South Africa. Until now, that hasn't mattered. Chinese banks are almost never allowed to fail, and the state ensures that savers can always access their cash. That makes the recent three-day panic in the eastern city of Yancheng all the more curious.\n\nFollowing a rumour that a customer had been refused a withdrawal, hundreds of depositors rushed to Jiangsu Sheyang Rural Commercial Bank.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

Even today, he feels an urge to improve his skills, and makes it a point to practise his calligraphy almost daily.\n\n\"I always tell my friends that despite having practised art for so long, I don't think I'm that good yet, and that even in another 100 years, I'll still be endeavouring hard to get better at my art,\" says Lim, who won the Cultural Medallion in 2003 and is known for his Chinese ink paintings of nostalgic cultural landscapes of Singapore.\n\nJust five years ago, the 93-year-old's drive for self-improvement led to him devising a new series of calligraphic works, that ties together the world of painting and traditional calligraphy. Thirty of these new artworks are on display at Artcommune gallery this weekend, in an exhibition titled Tze Peng: Songs from the Heart.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Net credit margins are also attractive in the international markets, he noted.\n\nPre-tax earnings from the international branded cards business - or business outside of North America - stood at US$2.1 billion as at the fourth quarter of last year, making up about 45 per cent of total earnings of US$4.8 billion. The remainder of total earnings comes from North America.\n\nNet credit loss rates - one measure of loan delinquency in the cards business - have also been \"well below\" pre-crisis levels, said Mr Linville.\n\nThis comes as the bank plans to better leverage its global presence, by allowing card holders to be offered the same services and privileges, regardless of whether they are home or abroad.\n\nThis will partly be done through the use of a global rewards points transfer system, to be launched in a third of markets by this year. With this, the bank expects to boost cross-border purchases through their credit cards.\n\nGlobally, the bank will also streamline the number of its card offerings, and standardise the credit card portfolio, Mr Linville said.\n\nThis is already being done in Singapore, with the cards targeting three different tiers of affluent customers here, said Jacquelyn Tan, managing director of credit payment products at Citibank Singapore.\n\nCiti is the largest credit card issuer in the world in receivables terms. It also claims top spot in Singapore, being the largest credit card issuer for Visa, the leading payment card brand here.\n\nSingapore also offers a strong case study in data security. Citi, together with other major US banks, are currently lobbying for tokenisation - or the use of tokens as a means of protecting card data - in the US. The use of tokens is already prevalent in Singapore.\n\nThe US is migrating towards the use of an embedded microchip for data storage in credit cards as a fraud prevention mechanism, and is expected to do so by next year.\n\nThis technology, known as the Europay Mastercard Visa (EMV) standard, can secure card transactions at point-of-sale terminals, but is less relevant for transactions where the physical card is not present, such as with online payments.\n\nMr Linville did not see a timeline for the expected shift towards the use of tokens in the US, but did not foresee a significant lift in costs, given the scalability of the cards business.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Many of these comedians have also done shows at the world-famous comedy event.\n\nUnited Kingdom-based comedian Luisa Omielan is just one of those coming for the festival. Her show, entitled What Would Beyonce Do?, is targeted at a niche audience. \"The girls and gays! 20 to 30 year-old somethings who love Beyonce,\" she says. \"And if you're not in that bracket, you will still love it!\"\n\nConsidering her last tour was extended twice and sold out both times at the last Edinburgh Fringe, there's no question What Would Beyonce Do? will be one of the festival's hottest ticket .\n\nMr Bennett believes that the comedy scene in Singapore is changing and a festival like this is just what it needs to give it that extra boost. \"There have been various forms of comedy in Singapore for some time but we want to take it to the next level,\" he says. \"There's definitely a market here for this sort of entertainment. With the response so far, we can double the size of the festival next year.\"\n\nVernon Lewis, a comedian who moved from Los Angeles to Singapore three or four years ago, is helping with the organisation of the event. He says: \"I came here to work at Universal Studios and first started comedy here out of interest. It was a small scene but now there are 50 to 60 locals and expats who are regulars. They're entering competitions overseas in Australia and Hong Kong. They really want to take it to the next level and this festival will help them with that.\"\n\nBut Mr Lewis notes that although comedians here have potential, they sometimes lack the chops that come with experience and stage time required to do a full show at the upcoming festival. Hence, they will get a chance to host; where they'll go up for about 10 minutes at a time in between acts at each show. \"With this exposure - getting to mix with these international comedians - they'll learn a lot,\" he says.\n\nAt the moment, there are roughly 18 people gearing up to host shows at the festival - 11 of whom are Singaporeans and the rest, expats.\n\nSamuel See is one of the comedians set to host a show. He says: \"I'm excited to meet the international comedians coming. The Singapore comedy scene is a fantastic work of beauty. It's a mish mash of people, culture, countries and crazy ideas!\"\n\nThe feeling is mutual for Australia-based comedian, Jason Chong. \"I can't wait to meet the local comics. I've heard great things about the scene!\"\n\nMagners Singapore International Comedy Festival runs from April 23 to 26.

For now, Facebook will use its resources to make Oculus headgear affordable and ubiquitous, according to Mr Zuckerberg.\n\nThe California-based social network does not intend to become a hardware company, but Mr Zuckerberg said it is open to people using virtual reality devices for immersive shopping experiences at Facebook.\n\nFacebook plans to build on Oculus technology for areas such as communications, education, and entertainment.\n\nOculus shareholders will receive US$400 million in cash and 23.1 million Facebook shares in the deal.\n\nFacebook called Oculus, launched in 2012, the leader in immersive virtual reality technology with a strong following among developers.\n\nThe company has already garnered more than 75,000 orders for the US$350 Oculus Rift headset development kits.\n\n\"While the applications for virtual reality technology beyond gaming are in their nascent stages, several industries are already experimenting with the technology,\" Facebook said. \"Oculus has the chance to create the most social platform ever, and change the way we work, play and communicate.\"\n\nOculus's headset earned raves from reviewers at the annual global technology fair CES in Las Vegas in January.\n\nBuying it puts Facebook, the social networking leader, in competition with Oculus rival Sony for development of advanced virtual reality headsets.\n\nJapanese consumer electronic titan Sony last week unveiled \"Project Morpheus\", development of a virtual reality headgear system for its new-generation PlayStation 4 video game consoles.\n\nFacebook said Oculus will maintain its headquarters in Irvine, California, and continue developing the Rift platform.\n\nWord of the deal stymied some analysts, who noted that the people hot to get hands on Oculus headsets have been hardcore video game players.\n\n\"It's a cool technology,\" said Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group. \"I just don't know why Facebook wants it, unless they are having incredible Google envy. It has nothing to do with social networking.\"\n\nIt appeared to Forrester media analyst James McQuivey that Facebook made the big-ticket buy out of fear that the social network might miss out on the next big thing in Internet lifestyles.\n\nHe saw no good fit between Facebook and virtual reality, saying the technology does not promise to be an irresistible addition to social networking.\n\n\"Facebook is putting itself in a position to offer an experience we are not going to need that much, especially if it means strapping something to your head,\" Mr McQuivey told AFP. \"If this is Facebook's way of getting into a Google Glass type experience, that makes a little more sense but they could do that from scratch.\"\n\nGoogle on Monday said it is joining forces with the frame giant behind Ray-Ban, Oakley and other high-end brands to create and sell Glass Internet-linked eyewear in the United States.\n\nThe California-based technology titan billed the partnership with Luxottica as its \"biggest step yet into the emerging smart eyewear market\".\n\nThe Oculus acquisition comes just weeks after Facebook made a deal to buy mobile messaging service WhatsApp for more than US$19 billion in cash and stock, expanding its global footprint. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

The upcoming Downtown Line and the Bartley Viaduct will also be within close proximity.\n\nThe condominium is also a five-minute drive to the Tampines Regional Centre, touted to be the \"commercial hub of the east\" housing many major banks and insurance companies such as AIA, UOB and DBS, as well as malls such as Tampines Mall and Century Square.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The cargo market remained sluggish,\" it said, calling market conditions for the year \"severe\".\n\nRevenue from the company's mainland China operations, which make up more than 65 per cent of its business, fell 3.31 per cent to 64.39 billion yuan, while European operations were up 5.71 per cent at 10.15 billion yuan.\n\nLooking ahead to 2014, the airline said: \"The aviation industry will continue to face serious challenges such as intensifying competition, dwindling resources, and rising operating costs.\"\n\nIn May last year, the carrier ordered 100 Airbus A320 medium-range single-aisle passenger jets, which carry a catalogue price of US$8.8 billion, to expand its fleet capacity.\n\nIt said it carried 77.68 million passengers in 2013, up 7.27 per cent from the previous year. It also signed an agreement in March 2013 to buy 31 Boeing aircraft at a cost of US$5.2 billion, including eight B777 cargo planes.\n\nAir China last year said that net profit dropped almost 35 per cent in 2012 due to high fuel costs and sluggish demand for international air travel.\n\nThe counter closed at HK$4.66 yesterday, down 2.51 per cent. - AFP\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The page will also be made more readable.\n\nThe company announcements page informs investors and other users of market-moving events such as financial results, mergers and acquisitions, and contract wins. It is widely used by brokers, retail investors and other market watchers, though remisiers usually have their own in-house platforms to get data.\n\nBT had raised these issues among others in a commentary published yesterday. SGX has also received feedback on some of them.\n\nFor example, someone searching for announcements made by Cache Logistics Trust could not find the Reit on the announcements page. Instead, one would have to look under the Reit's manager, ARA-CWT Trust Management (Cache) Limited.\n\nThose searching for CDL Hospitality Trusts could not even find the name of its manager, M&C Reit Management Limited. Instead, announcements by the stapled group were parked under the name of the company it had set up for a medium-term note programme, CDLHT MTN Pte Ltd.\n\n\"It's not even the name of the manager ... this really hurts retail investors interested in Reits,\" an analyst told BT.\n\nPrivate investor and stock activist Mano Sabnani pointed out that with the new changes, \"news itself was squeezed into the last column\" while two whole columns were devoted to the company and security names. This forced people to strain to read the subject matter of announcements.\n\nBT understands that column widths will be made wider.\n\nLast night's fix also enabled people to click on announcements directly to open them, instead of having to click, counter-intuitively, on the company name two columns away. \"Initially I thought it was my IT ineptness and gave up after a couple of attempts,\" a reader wrote on the matter.\n\nA broker added that the numbering system for announcements should not have been taken out. \"They should revert to the previous format which was fine ... numbering definitely helps, as it is easier to scroll up or down to keep track of where we are reading,\" he said.\n\nMr Utama said that the changes SGX made to the page last weekend were part of an upgrade to its SGXNet portal services used by companies to make announcements and initiate corporate actions.\n\n\"This initiative will involve continuous improvements in several phases. As new phases of this initiative unfold, we will greatly appreciate feedback from the media and the public at\n\nwebmaster@sgx.com\n\n.\"\n\nThe fixes last night added two buttons for investors to search by company name or security name, with the system defaulting to the more widely used security name.\n\nSearching by company name allows investors to look for announcements related to all its issues of bonds or preference shares.\n\nMeanwhile, other problems raised by BT such as the lack of a mobile platform, and what happens to companies that change their names, will take more time to fix.\n\nAnother unresolved issue is the accessibility of historical announcements. SGX currently has a limit of five years, beyond which people need to pay to access the data.\n\nUltimately, SGX can learn from other investor-friendly sites out there, said reader Kevin Gin.\n\nHe cited various examples: On the Shanghai Stock Exchange's site, investors can select stocks by region or industry; on the Philippine Stock Exchange's site, investors can sort stocks according to a variety of categories like name, outstanding shares, free float, and price changes; on the Brazilian Stock Exchange's site, financial data and shareholder positions are clearly displayed.\n\n\"The world is our hunting ground, and we choose the market and exchange which offers us value,\" Mr Gin said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The number of hotels in Nigeria rose 88 per cent to 6,200 in the two years through December, according to the country's tourism development agency.\n\nEconomic growth in Africa's biggest oil producer will accelerate this year from an estimated 6.4 per cent last year, driven by services, trade and agriculture, the Washington-based International Monetary Fund said on March 7.\n\n\"Improvements in the nation's economic outlook are motivations to investors,\" said Sally Mbanefo, director general of the Nigerian Tourism Development Corp. Hotel rooms jumped to 186,000 from 99,000 over the past two years.\n\nProtea's expansion plans in Nigeria focus on Port Harcourt in the oil-rich Niger Delta, the nation's capital Abuja and the south-eastern state of Enugu, according to Mr Bryer. Domestic tourism revenue in Nigeria is targeted to triple to US$12 billion within a decade, creating more than 400,000 jobs, Ms Mbanefo said.\n\n\"If just 20 per cent of Nigeria's approximately 160 million population spend 10 per cent of their per capita income of over US$2,000 on domestic tourism, we will have an annual domestic tourism market of US$12 billion,\" she said.\n\nHotel investors and operators, finding growth slowing in mature European and US markets, are expanding in Africa as the continent is buoyed by increasing trade with countries including China and rising demand for services such as lodging.\n\n\"Protea currently has 10 operational hotels in Nigeria and around 115 in total in seven African countries, with two more scheduled to open in Ghana and Rwanda,\" Mr Bryer said.\n\nWith the Ghana oilfields also creating demand for business travel, Protea will open a 130-room hotel in Takoradi in the country's western region later this year, he said.- Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

That's more than four times as many as just 20 years ago,\" she said. \"The largest ships can now accommodate more than 6,000 passengers and 2,000 crew.\"\n\nBy comparison, the \"unsinkable\" Titanic was carrying 2,224 passengers and crew when it hit an iceberg off Newfoundland on its 1912 maiden voyage and sank, in history's most infamous maritime disaster.\n\nMore serious accidents and incidents, Ms Hersman said, can only be headed off \"by continually seeking safety improvements\".\n\nWhile Americans make up a big chunk of cruise ship passengers, responsibility for safety rests with the country in which a ship is registered - often a small nation hard-pressed to enforce the rules.\n\n\"The US role in cruise ship safety is not as high as many people would think it would be,\" Ms Hersman told reporters later in the day.\n\nSome 115 cruise ships are registered in the Bahamas, said John Akhurst, deputy director of the Bahamas Maritime Authority.\n\nThis includes vessels operated by cruise industry giants Carnival and Royal Caribbean.\n\nInternational maritime law requires a ship to have a \"genuine link\" with its country of registry, but Mr Akhurst noted the absence of a clear definition of what that link ought to be.\n\nHe defended the Bahamas' open-door policy towards registering ships whose owners are in other countries, saying: \"Standards are not relaxed to attract tonnage.\"\n\nSome 350 cruise ships are now sailing, with seven to nine new ones joining them every year, said Thomas Weigend of Germany's Meyer Werft, one of five shipyards worldwide specialising in the increasingly mammoth vessels.\n\nBut only \"a really small percentage\" meet an IMO design standard, set in 2010, whereby a ship is fitted with sufficient safety features to make its way back to port in the event of an emergency, said Daniel Povel of Det Norske Veritas-Germanischer Lloyd, a non-profit maritime inspection service in Norway. - AFP\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Small-cap shares tracked by the Russell 2000 Index have rallied for seven straight quarters, the longest stretch ever, sending valuations 26 per cent above levels at the height of the 1990s rally. Gains in stocks from LogMeIn Inc to Athenahealth Inc have pushed the gauge up 248 per cent since the bull market began five years ago, leaving price-earnings ratios about three times as high as for shares in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.\n\nSurging small-caps were cited by Federal Reserve governor Daniel Tarullo last month as one reason policy makers should ensure they're not creating systemic risk in financial markets. While the increase in the Russell 2000 reflects speculation America's economy will expand faster than the rest of the world, investors may be getting ahead of themselves, according to Matthew Peron of Northern Trust Corp in Chicago. \"Small-caps are all getting painted with the brush of success,\" Mr Peron said on March 19. \"The story is more nuanced than that.\"\n\nUS stocks rose last week, with the S&P 500 climbing 1.4 per cent and the Russell 2000 adding one per cent, as better-than-forecast data on jobless claims and manufacturing offset comments by Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen that interest rates could rise in the middle of next year. The benchmark gauge for smaller shares has risen 1.3 per cent this quarter, compared with a 0.5 per cent gain in the S&P 500.\n\nSmall-caps, whose market value averages US$1.07 billion, have led the bull market as three rounds of monetary stimulus from the Fed drove investors into riskier assets. The Russell 2000 has returned 30 per cent a year since March 2009, compared with a 25 per cent increase in the S&P 500. Pier 1 Imports, a Fort Worth, Texas-based furniture store, and Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, a developer of renal disease treatment in New York, rose the most, each advancing about 13,000 per cent during the period.\n\nThe outperformance accelerated this year even as earnings growth trailed large-caps. Profits from Russell 2000 companies climbed 6.8 per cent in the last quarter, compared with 8.6 per cent in the S&P 500. While bigger companies exceeded analysts' estimates by a combined 4.6 per cent, smaller firms missed by 13 per cent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\n\"The space has undoubtedly been on fire,\" Jim Russell at US Bank Wealth Management in Cincinnati, said on March 19. \"Trees don't grow to the sky and you have to be wary of what you pay for that growth.\"\n\nAs prices surged and earnings increased at a slower rate than analysts anticipated, smaller companies have become more expensive than they've been 86 per cent of the time since 1995, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Russell 2000 is trading for 49 times reported earnings, compared with a multiple of 39 in March 2000. The S&P 500 has a price-earnings ratio of 17.2, close to its average since 1937, data compiled by Bloomberg and S&P show.\n\nThe Russell 2000 slumped 43 per cent between March 2000 and October 2002, about six percentage points less than the S&P 500.\n\nLogMeIn, which offers remote computer connectivity to mobile professionals, and Athenahealth, a provider of online services to doctors and hospitals, are among nine companies with a P/E ratio above 1,000. \"It's a hard place to find a lot of bargains right now,\" Donald Yacktman at Yacktman Asset Management said. \"It doesn't surprise me that this market, particularly small-caps, could be pretty highly valued and way out of whack.\"\n\nCentral bankers must preserve the option of using interest rates to contain financial bubbles even as they strengthen supervisory tools to curtail systemic risk, Fed's Mr Tarullo said on Feb 25. \"Valuations do appear stretched\" for some small technology firms, Mr Tarullo said. \"Monetary policy action cannot be taken off the table as a response to the build-up of broad and sustained systemic risk.\"\n\nMs Yellen said last week that the central bank's stimulus programme could end this fall and benchmark interest rates may rise about six months later. The Fed had previously said it wouldn't raise rates for a considerable period, without specifying a time frame.\n\n\"The change in the narrative is partially to remove that speculative excess,\" David Lafferty at Natixis Global Asset Management in Boston said on March 20. \"When you combine the higher valuations in the small-cap world with less accommodative Fed policy, you have the potential for great volatility.\"\n\nThe small-caps rally is occurring as the US economy is forecast to accelerate from what has been the slowest recovery since World War II. Gross domestic product will increase 2.7 per cent this year and reach 3 per cent in 2015, according to the median estimates from 99 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.\n\nChina's economic slowdown and political crises from Thailand to Ukraine helped fuel demand for American small-caps as investors shunned conglomerates that are more reliant on global revenue. The average firm in the Russell 2000 gets 84 per cent of its sales from the US, compared with 70 per cent for the S&P 500, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\n\"Investors are willing to pay more for growth,\" Kristina Hooper at Allianz Global Investors in New York said. \"You do have greater sensitivity to the economic recovery so as the recovery picks up, small-caps will continue to benefit.\" Exchange-traded funds investing in small-cap shares attracted US$5.73 billion this year through March 20, compared with withdrawals of US$10.7 billion from those focused on large companies, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nA quarter of Russell 2000 companies didn't make any money in the last 12 months and their shares rose 7.6 per cent on average in 2014, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Firms with profits trailed, rising 2.2 per cent.\n\nEight stocks more than doubled this year. Among them, all but one are drugmakers that are unprofitable. Intercept Pharmaceuticals soared 473 per cent after saying its experimental liver disease treatment reached its goal in an early trial. The New York-based company, whose sales were less than US$2 million in 2013, won't make a profit until 2017, analysts forecast. While CEO Mark Pruzanski said in January that it's too early to predict when the drug will be marketed, the stock performed the best in the Russell 2000.\n\nInterMune Inc jumped 135 per cent this year as its drug pirfenidone for a fatal lung disease met goals of a study expected to support US approval. The company has reported losses every year in the past decade. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg say it won't make any money until 2016.\n\n\"Biotech is the perfect example that looks a bit frothy, to say the least,\" Matthew McGeary at Eagle Asset Management said. \"There are clearly investors willing to take on risk and looking for hyper growth. That's what the industry is getting right now - people flow where the momentum is.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom: survey\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

It delayed the plan pending questions on state policy on airline companies operating airports.\n\nAny unsolicited infrastructure project proposal, like the one San Miguel is planning, is subject to government scrutiny and must first be presented to President Benigno Aquino, Transportation Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya said.\n\nUpon the president's approval, it is then subjected to a Swiss challenge where other bidders are asked to compete for the project, with the original proponent allowed to match the best proposal.\n\nMr Abaya said the government, with the help of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), is also studying the possibility of converting a former US navy base at Sangley Point, in Cavite province, into an alternative international airport. He said its location, just 20 minutes from Manila, makes it ideal.\n\nThe Sangley airport project is part of a 2.3 trillion peso (S$64.7 billion) transportation infrastructure plan JICA has presented to the government. The plan also involves building subway and rail networks.\n\n\"The NAIA is already getting saturated; there is no more time,\" Shizuo Iwata, project manager at JICA, said regarding the US$9 billion airport component of JICA's \"Dream Plan\". The plan is awaiting approval of an inter-agency committee chaired by Mr Aquino.\n\nAccording to the Nikkei, San Miguel plans to build an airport with four runways on an 800 hectare property within the metropolis under a build-operate- transfer scheme. Ownership of the facility will be turned over to the government after 25 years.\n\nThe size is double the 400 ha lot occupied by NAIA, which, with its single runway, exceeded its maximum annual capacity of 30 million passengers last year, according to the transportation department. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

A landmark domestic bond default earlier this month and headlines of bankruptcies - highlighted last week by Zhejiang Xingrun Real Estate Co - have underscored concerns that an unprecedented surge in company debt in China is now showing signs of unravelling.\n\n\"The quality of these loans extended by Hong Kong banks to Chinese companies has not been tested,\" said Mirza Baig, head of foreign exchange and interest rate strategy at BNP Paribas in Singapore. \"That is a concern in the backdrop of the rapid rise in exposure.\"\n\nForeign bank claims on China hit US$1 trillion last year, up from nearly zero 10 years ago, and the biggest portion was provided by Hong Kong, Bank of International Settlements (BIS) data shows.\n\nThe US$430 billion in loans outstanding represents 165 per cent of Hong Kong's gross domestic product (GDP), BIS data shows.\n\nData from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the city's de facto central bank, showed a similar astonishing rise. By the end of 2013, Hong Kong banks' net claims on China as a percentage of their total loan book was nearing 40 per cent, compared with zero by 2010.\n\nThe rival financial centre of Singapore has also ramped up its China loans as well, but its exposure is the equivalent of 15 per cent of its GDP, figures from its monetary authority show. Local banks in both these centres have taken over lending that foreign banks once dominated, drawn by cheap funding rates following the global financial crisis, a voracious appetite from Chinese borrowers and healthy growth in the world's second biggest economy.\n\n\"Hong Kong banks have pounced on arbitrage opportunities between on-and offshore renminbi funding rates,\" said Cathy Holcombe, a strategist at Gavekal Dragonomics.\n\nThere is no breakdown of the type of loans behind the US$430 billion figure. But Stephen Long, managing director of financial institutions at Moody's Investor Services, said \"a substantial part\" is in lower-risk categories such as trade finance. This would include loans to Hong Kong bluechip companies operating on the mainland or loans supported by guarantees from Chinese banks.\n\nHowever, trade finance may also hide speculative flows that bet on a rise in the yuan - a popular trade encouraged by the currency's 2.9 per cent rise against the dollar last year.\n\nIn this trade, investors and companies falsify trade receipts to convert foreign currency into yuan and avoid capital controls. This year's slide in the yuan may also pinch debtors' ability to service their loans.\n\nThe yuan has dropped nearly 3 per cent, wiping out its 2013 gains, putting it on track for its worst March quarter since 1992.\n\n\"Most of these loans are not hedged completely on a currency basis even if they are collateralised and the currency volatility means some of these banks may be sitting on large currency losses,\" said a trade banker at a large European bank.\n\nStock and credit analysts also say a big chunk of the loans has ended up in China's property and financial sectors, as well as industries with surplus output capacity, such as steel - areas where regulators are trying to control lending.\n\nTo be sure, capital buffers at Hong Kong banks are much higher than minimum international standards and the central bank has not shown any alarm about the lending. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

Instead, they are more determined on keeping jobs for Chinese yard workers,\" he said.\n\n\"Shipbuilding (in China) is very irrational, emotive and a political subject as these yards support thousands of jobs.\n\n\"They (Chinese yards) don't really care about the long-term impact and well-being of the industry.\"\n\nGiving an example of the effect of the fierce competition from Chinese yards, he said that the market for 5,000 horsepower anchor handling vessels has seen \"flat buying\" for the last nine years because of a structural over-capacity in the China yards.\n\nThese yards are now shifting some of the over-capacity to building larger and medium-sized vessels, including the 8,000 horsepower anchor handlers.\n\n\"Anyone who is in those sectors should be afraid. China is coming after you!\" he quipped.\n\nMr Horsington suggested that shipbuilders in Singapore and the region will only be safe in \"high value-added sectors where quality counts\".\n\nHe backed this up with some recent statistics. He said that of the 25 1,600 horsepower anchor handlers being built at present, the Chinese market share is fairly small.\n\n\"China has (contracts for) four of them only - less than a quarter - while Norway has five and Singapore, six.\"\n\nTherefore, he pointed out, in the high value-added vessels sector, where high quality and specialised designs are important, yards from Singapore and the region can still compete and win.\n\nShipowners, he claimed, are wary of China yards when it comes to quality and timeliness of delivery of vessels and said that Jaya's initial experience of building in Chinese yards found this to be true. He added that although these characteristics are less important in building smaller vessels, they result in significant cost considerations when it comes to the building of deep-sea vessels for the oil exploration & production work sector, for instance.\n\nMr Horsington also pointed to the \"new frontiers\" for the industry in Africa, specifically in Angola, Mozambique and Tanzania, where good quality builds and reliable vessels are needed in the absence of a steady supply of parts there. With good shore support there, these markets could offer South-east Asian yards a niche where they can prosper.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Starting at 6.15am at the F1 pit building, they will cycle 39km in The Business Times Charity Challenge, a part of OCBC Cycle Singapore.\n\nTerence Kee, director of the Transplant Centre at SingHealth's Singapore General Hospital (SGH), explains why they signed up:\n\n\"OCBC Cycle is the biggest cycling event in Singapore, with over 10,000 cyclists hitting the road during the weekend. I find it a golden opportunity for us to participate in our favourite sport and at the same time to spread the good news about organ and tissue donation and transplantation.\"\n\nFunds raised by the Charity Challenge will benefit SingHealth Transplant TRUEfund, which helps needy transplant recipients and funds transplant education and research, and Dover Park Hospice equally.\n\n\"This year, we have decided on the theme 'The Cycle of Life' to illustrate how transplantation offers a new cycle of life to those with life threatening end-organ and tissue failure,\" said Dr Kee.\n\nSingHealth's cyclists will wear a specially designed jersey reflecting that theme when they line up alongside the other Charity Challenge teams, including The Business Times' very own 'Business Cycles'.\n\nSingHealth will be represented by one team of transplant recipients and donors, and another comprising SingHealth staff members Dr Kee, Aizawa Marco, Muhammad Razi bin Kasmin and Chua Jia Jia.\n\nMr Marco, a National Heart Centre staff nurse, took part in last year's OCBC Business Times Charity Challenge to raise funds for TRUEfund as well.\n\n\"I have been an avid cyclist for over 10 years. I enjoy cycling as it allows me to have a good workout. I love endurance sports and cycling long distances allows me to test my capabilities and motivates me to train harder to improve myself,\" he added.\n\nFor Ms Chua, an SGH transplant coordinator, however, the third edition of the Charity Challenge marks her first charity race. She started training about one month before the event.\n\nBut training is a year-round affair for Mr Razi, an SGH occupational therapist: \"I cycle daily from my home in Serangoon to my SGH workplace at Outram. What is needed for the Charity Challenge is stamina. Speed should (not be) excessive so that people can have a good look at our SingHealth Transplant jerseys.\"\n\nMs Chua also emphasised the purpose of the Charity Challenge: \"By raising awareness of organ and tissue donation . . . misconceptions (of compromised donor health) can be addressed and hopefully, more potential donors will step forward for their loved ones and save more lives.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A trading executive reckoned that there has been a 10-15 per cent increase in physical and paper trades here in Q1 compared with the same period last year, as a result of the market trending up and down because of the volatility.\n\nIt has been in contango at times and backwardation at others, he told The Business Times, referring to the exact opposite market conditions where the future price of oil is respectively higher, or conversely lower, than spot prices.\n\n\"Volatility is good,\" agreed the oil trading boss, though he believes that \"trading volumes here haven't really increased significantly in Q1\".\n\nThe emergence of new Gulf oil refineries has closed off oil product markets both there and in the West, including for middle distillates such as diesel and jet fuel, he said, with this leaving Singapore traders with just the regional Asian market play.\n\nAn oil terminal source concurs. \"Trading volumes here have been down for the past year, and traders have had to share their storage space which they have leased with others to optimise its use,\" he said. \"Trading volumes have not been sustainable.\"\n\nOil markets have also been reacting to Russia's annexation of Crimea as well as oil industry issues in Libya, with Gunvor - one of the world's largest oil traders with global offices including in Singapore - drawn into the political confrontation over Ukraine, after the US Treasury slapped sanctions on Gennady Timchenko, a Gunvor co-founder.\n\nSwitzerland-based Gunvor issued a statement, including to the Singapore Exchange (SGX), on March 21, that Mr Timchenko had sold his entire Gunvor stake (43.5 per cent) to co-founder Torbjorn Tornqvist \"to ensure . . . the continued and uninterrupted operations of Gunvor\", in anticipation of potential economic sanctions.\n\nTrading sources here said they are continuing to do business with Gunvor, but are exercising some caution given the US action. Earlier London reports suggested that US oil companies would be especially wary of trading with Gunvor.\n\n\"But as long as the banks are still supporting trades with Gunvor, there is no problem,\" the trading boss here said.\n\nIn an industry-wide shake-out here caused by the generally lacklustre market, Gunvor, as well as several other trading houses including Lukoil and PetroChina, saw some traders exiting their doors recently.\n\n\"The physical oil market has been especially difficult to trade,\" the trading executive said, pointing for instance to Arcadia Energy's withdrawal from physical oil trading in Asia.\n\nThe international banks too have been withdrawing from the commodities market. Earlier this week, JP Morgan Chase, one of the so-called \"Wall Street refiners\", sold off its entire physical commodities trading operations, including in Singapore, to Swiss trader Mercuria for US$3.5 billion.\n\n\"While the market has been more favourable in Q1, it's nevertheless still a challenging market,\" the trading executive said. Underlining this, the trading firm boss remarked: \"It's never been easy.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Others have chosen to tie up with established security firms; for example, online bullion retailer Goldmoney offers storage options for gold and silver at storage providers Brink's and Malca-Amit.\n\nSilver Bullion also had an arrangement with Certis Cisco to use its safe deposit boxes, but with its own vault now, it will become a one-stop shop for its customers.\n\nIts founder Gregor Gregersen said: \"From an investor point of view, it's a great deal because you don't have any intermediary.\"\n\nCustomers will be the legal title owners of precious metals stored there.\n\nMr Gregersen said that, as a newcomer to secured storage, Silver Bullion has had to work harder at ensuring the robustness of its security features. A security check is required upon entering the building, and another to enter the facility itself; motion sensors and vibration sensors have been installed, as has a 2.5-tonne vault door.\n\n\"The way we set this up was secure enough for the insurance company to trust us,\" Mr Gregersen said.\n\nBullion owners will be covered by insurance for up to US$100 million for each loss. The insurer is the Ireland-headquartered XL Group, a member of the specialised insurance market Lloyd's of London.\n\nThe facility is now open only to Silver Bullion's customers, but could count institutional investors such as fund managers among its users in the future.\n\nSome 40 per cent of Silver Bullion's customers are Americans, who are worried about the long-term trend of growing US government debt, said Mr Gregersen.\n\n\"In our customers' minds, it's only a matter of time before the US dollar is not accepted anymore,\" he said.\n\nBloomberg has reported that marketable US government debt now stands at a record US$12 trillion, up from US$4.5 billion in 2007.\n\nThe move by Silver Bullion comes as other secured storage providers see their silver vaults bursting at the seams.\n\nMalca-Amit Global, which set up a 200-tonne silver vault here in July, said that it is now full.\n\nIts general manager Joshua Rotbart told The Business Times last week: \"We're looking into other solutions. We are looking into utilising the space we currently rent at the Freeport, and also to look for other options that are out there.\"\n\nSecured-storage firm Brink's, which stopped accepting silver for storage in December 2012 after demand for silver ballooned, said that it is now able to accommodate more bullion after adding new space at its Freeport location here.\n\nThe US-based company, which has vaults in two other locations here, opened its first precious-metals vault in the Freeport in 2012. It completed a second vault just this month. Its general manager Baskaran Narayanan said that the amount of silver stored with it has grown 6.5 times since mid-2012.\n\nDemand for precious metals in Singapore spiked after the government removed a 7 per cent sales tax on investment-grade precious metals in October 2012. Since then, a number of bullion retailers have set up shop, and banks such as Deutsche Bank, UBS and ANZ have opened vaults here.\n\nSwiss refinery Metalor is building a greenfield refinery in Jurong.\n\nWith a surge in demand for precious metals in Asia as well as Singapore's emergence as a precious metals hub, Brink's Mr Narayanan said that he expects \"exciting times in the next few months\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Of the five airlines serving these transcontinental routes - the others are Delta, United, JetBlue and Virgin America - American is the only carrier to do so. The first-class cabin on A321 transcontinental flights has 10 fully lie-flat seats, while the business-class cabin has 20 fully lie-flat seats; there is also in-flight Wi-Fi and in-seat entertainment throughout the entire aircraft.\n\nJetBlue, which has not offered premium-class service on transcontinental flights since its startup in 2000, will introduce new \"Mint\" service in June on these routes featuring a 56.6 centimetre seat that will convert into a fully lie-flat bed, with rates far below those of its competitors.\n\nMichael Derchin, an airline analyst for CRT Capital, said that the transcontinental routes American is promoting in its advertising are two of the carrier's \"most important\".\n\n\"American is battling with Delta and United over capturing as large a share of corporate travellers as possible, and these are key road-warrior routes, along with New York-London, New York-Chicago, etc,\" he said. \"These are big premium travel flights. Folks are more than willing to pay extra for a bigger seat and more comfortable experience. JetBlue and Virgin America are battling as well for the premium market. So it is a five-way dogfight, no prisoners taken.\"\n\nVann Graves, executive creative director of the New York office of McCann Erickson, said that the concept for the new campaign was inspired by research that found American flew the first eastbound and westbound non-stop transcontinental service, on DC-7 aircraft, in 1953, and that its \"most famous customers\" on these routes included, beside Peck and Kelly, Walt Disney, Sophia Loren, Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn and Nat King Cole.\n\n\"The way we could connect the glamour of the past with the new product was amazing. In 1953, American invented transcon service, and today it is reinventing it,\" he said.\n\nNew print advertising features two, four and eight-page spreads. The first page of one of the two-page spreads features a photo of Kelly, clutching her tickets and wearing a hat, gloves and pearl jewellery; the caption here says, \"In 1953, we invented transcontinental service.\"\n\nOn the facing page is a photo of Margulies, with a caption that begins, \"Today, we reinvent it,\" and continues, \"Enjoy refinement and exclusivity more often found on private jets, both on the ground and aboard the only true first class from coast to coast. Only on American. The legend is back.\"\n\nThe Kelly and Peck photographs in the campaign are by Milton Greene, while the photographs of Margulies and Harris are by fashion photographer Patrick Demarchelier; all the photographs in the campaign are black and white. The only colour in the print advertising is the red, white and blue American Airlines logo.\n\nFern Fernandez, vice-president of global marketing for American, said that Margulies and Harris were chosen to appear in the campaign because they are \"active travellers on American\". \"It's a great opportunity to be the face of the reinvention, and they are the customers we are trying to attract.\"\n\nIn addition to travellers from the entertainment industry, American is also trying to reach those in the high-tech industry, \"Wall Street types\" and \"folks we normally target for corporate sales\", he said.- NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

The company's shares will then be traded on the HKSE in Hong Kong dollars and on SGX in US dollars.\n\nThe in-principle approval and introduction are subject to certain conditions prior to listing. No shares are offered in connection with the introduction, the company said.\n\nAnalysts BT spoke with said they did not expect trading liquidity to change much after the secondary listing.\n\nUOB-Kay Hian analyst Vincent Khoo said: \"As it is, Genting Hong Kong already trades in Singapore, and it's much more liquid than in HKSE.\"\n\nAnother analyst who covers the stock said that the move could be more of a formalisation process.\n\n\"Institutional investors may take more notice of it if it is an official listing,\" he said.\n\nHe added that most of the interest he has received for the stock is from hedge funds and not long-term investors.\n\n\"If it is included in an index, then institutional investors will have to take even more notice if they benchmark themselves to indices,\" he said.\n\nThe next few months could potentially see more new listings on SGX, especially from real estate investment trusts (Reits) and business trusts.\n\nDeloitte chief of operations for clients and markets Ernest Kan said that rising interest rates from tapering of quantitative easing (QE) by the US Federal Reserve would put pressure on the performance of Reits.\n\n\"Seeing the trend of QE tapering, with interest rates likely to rise, Reits need to focus on pushing out their offerings in Q2, as later quarters in the year may see competitive interest rates from debt offerings,\" he said.\n\nYear-to-date, SGX has had five initial public offerings (IPOs), including one by way of introduction. During the corresponding period in 2013, SGX had four IPOs. However, proceeds from IPOs this year, at $433 million, have been far lower than the prior year period's $1.7 billion.\n\nThis was largely due to a $1.6 billion listing of Mapletree Greater China Commercial Trust last year, said Dr Kan.\n\nGenting Hong Kong shares rose half a US cent yesterday to close trading at 40 US cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So much so that, according to Thomson Reuters data, major banks skipped an estimated US$100 million in combined fees that they could have made from work for other clients over the past year.\n\nPeople familiar with the matter say that's because the banks didn't want to irk the Chinese e-commerce giant by working for its rivals or acquisition targets, and risk losing out on business in an IPO expected to be bigger than Facebook's US$16 billion listing in 2012.\n\nAlibaba's giant IPO comes amid a wave of deals in China's tech sector, putting banks in a tricky situation when it comes to backing clients in the industry. In a sector that's red-hot, companies are sensitive about letting advisers work on deals that run parallel to those of competitors for fear of confidential information leaking out.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There are also other issues that we have to attend to.\n\n\"From time to time, it may be necessary for us to meet, but otherwise we want to have a format that can involve more of the countries that have to participate in the activities,\" said Mr Lee, adding that the best institution to take charge of that would be the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\n\"That was the sense of the leaders at the discussions, which I think is a reasonable approach. The officials will discuss it further and we will set the direction the next time we meet in America in 2016.\"\n\nThe United States will once again host the NSS in two years' time. Washington was the venue for the inaugural summit four years ago.\n\nMeanwhile, in what was seen as the summit's breakthrough yesterday, 35 of the 53 countries participating in the NSS pledged to turn international guidelines on nuclear security into national laws.\n\nThe nations - including Israel, Kazakhstan and Turkey but, crucially, not Russia, with its huge stockpile of Soviet-era weapons - promised to \"realise or exceed\" the standards set out in guidelines laid down by the IAEA to safeguard nuclear materials.\n\nEarlier in the day, Mr Lee, before making his way to the summit meetings, met German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nAt the official residence of the German ambassador to the Netherlands in The Hague, the two leaders discussed a wide range of topics, including the challenges for regional stability in South-east Asia and Europe, and the prospects for growth.\n\nDuring the closed-door meeting described by Mr Lee's press secretary as \"warm and cordial\", Mr Lee expressed his appreciation of Germany's support for the early ratification of the European Union-Singapore free trade agreement (FTA).\n\nThis landmark deal is the first bilateral agreement between the EU and a South-east Asian country. Germany is the largest economy in Europe. When fully implemented, the FTA will give both Singapore and EU companies greater market access and business opportunities.\n\nMr Lee and Dr Merkel also discussed the common challenges facing their respective countries, such as an ageing population and how to maintain economic competitiveness.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is therefore with deep sadness and regret that I must inform you that, according to this new data, flight MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean,\" said Mr Najib in a televised news conference in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nAccording to the BBC and various news outlets, Malaysia Airlines had earlier sent a text message to the families of those on board, saying: \"We have to assume beyond any reasonable doubt that MH370 has been lost and none of those on board survived . . . We must now accept all evidence suggests the plane went down in the Southern Indian Ocean.\"\n\nThe fresh information is the result of further calculations by satellite giant Inmarsat and the UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch. According to Mr Najib, further data on MH370's flight path was gained \"using a type of analysis never before used in an investigation of this sort\".\n\nIt is still unclear why the jet wound up so far off course.\n\nNoting that Malaysia Airlines had earlier spoken to the families of the 227 passengers and 12 crew members involved to inform them of the new developments, Mr Najib said that another press conference with further details would be held today.\n\n\"In the meantime, we wanted to inform you of this new development at the earliest opportunity. We share this information out of a commitment to openness and respect for the families, two principles which have guided this investigation.\"\n\nHe also appealed to the media to respect the privacy of affected families, calling the past few weeks \"heartbreaking\" for them and the latest news \"harder still\".\n\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who is attending the Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague, said in a Facebook post that he is \"deeply saddened to hear about the tragic fate\" of MH370.\n\nSaid Mr Lee: \"For more than two weeks, we have been hoping against hope, that somehow the worst did not happen. We now know how anguished and desperate the families and friends of those on board felt.\n\n\"While we are still far from understanding what happened, I hope this latest news will nonetheless give some certainty and closure. My deepest sympathies and condolences to the families and friends of those on board, and to the governments of Malaysia and China.\"\n\nFlight MH370 first disappeared from radar screens in the early hours of March 8, while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. It was carrying passengers - including two infants - from 14 nationalities, the bulk of whom (153 passengers) were from China.\n\nMalaysia believes the plane was deliberately diverted, and that someone on the flight shut off the plane's communications systems.\n\nSome 26 countries have been involved in search efforts since the plane disappeared, including Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, China, the US, South Korea, Japan and the UK.\n\nBut the missing jet has proven elusive. In recent days, the hunt has focused on the southern Indian Ocean area, with Australian and Chinese aircraft reporting new sightings of objects.\n\nStill, nothing has been retrieved, and spotted objects have yet to be confirmed as being from MH370.\n\nIn a statement on its website yesterday, Malaysia Airlines vowed that the ongoing multinational search operation would continue, as it seeks \"answers to the questions which remain\".\n\n\"We know there are no words that we or anyone else can say which can ease your pain . . . We would like to assure you that Malaysia Airlines will continue to give you our full support throughout the difficult weeks and months ahead.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The alliance still needs approval from Chinese and European regulators before it can become fully effective.\n\nMaersk Line said it expected to receive Chinese and EU approval before the middle of this year. \"We expect that the P3 can be started mid-2014,\" it noted.\n\nHowever, a spokesman for Joaquin Almunia, the European Competition Commissioner, said the EU was still assessing the proposed alliance because it would exceed the 30 per cent market share allowed for shipping consortia.\n\nHe could not give an indication of when a decision would be made.\n\n\"North America and the US in particular is a key shipping market. Therefore, the decision by the FMC is a very important step towards overall approval of P3,\" a Maersk spokesman said.\n\nWith a global market share of around 15 per cent, Maersk Line is the world's biggest container shipping company, while MSC with around 13 per cent and CMA CGM with around 8 per cent are number two and three respectively.\n\nThe three shipping firms plan to commit all vessels deployed on the three routes into a joint vessel operation centre located in London that will operate the combined fleet independently.\n\nThe US Shippers Association says the aim of the tie-up is to drive out weaker carriers and increase market share. \"In the case of the trans-Atlantic, it is a short step to the 50 per cent mark and beyond, where the P3 would have a controlling share of the market, which would be a very dangerous and detrimental situation,\" it wrote to the FMC last year. \"It is just a matter of a short time before the P3 controls the trans-Atlantic market.\"\n\nAnalysts from investment bank Alm Brand Markets forecast the tie-up could lower Maersk Line's costs by up to 6 per cent. The lower costs would mainly be driven by bigger and more energy-efficient vessels, they added.\n\nMaersk has ordered 20 super-size vessels from South Korea's Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering. Four of them were put into service on the busy route between Asia and Europe last year, helping to lower costs per unit.\n\nAn additional 16 of the Triple-E class vessels are scheduled for delivery during 2014-2015.\n\nLars Jensen from maritime analysis company SeaIntel said the alliance operating with larger vessels and maximising utilisation would result in significant improvements in their unit costs compared with their competitors.\n\nHe estimates the alliance will operate with vessels that on average are 2.000-3.000 TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit containers) bigger than competitors. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

As the world ponders the question that has confounded it for the last 18 days - \"Where is MH370?\" - a longer-term question to be considered is, \"Where is Malaysia going?\"\n\nIt now has less than six years to go before 2020 - the year by which the country is supposed to attain its \"Wawasan 2020\", the much-vaunted vision of becoming a fully developed nation. Even as the country moves forward, the engine that drives it is not as robust as before. Last year, Malaysia recorded a gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 4.7 per cent - down from 5.6 per cent in 2012, and lower than its average annual growth of 4.9 per cent from 2000 to 2012.\n\nThe prognosis for the future is not much better - the World Bank's forecast for Malaysia's growth rate this year stands at 4.8 per cent, followed by 4.9 per cent for 2015 and 2016.

SAP's collaboration with IDA (Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore), for example, promotes technology among youths, while growing the long-term tech industry talent base.\n\nSingapore civil society has an active community and high willingness to give - the challenge is identifying the right organisations to team up with for long-term, sustainable community programmes.\n\nTerry O'Connor\n\nGroup CEO\n\nCourts Asia\n\nCORPORATE social responsibility (CSR) cannot be an afterthought but a key pillar of an organisation's business model and operations. Being a good corporate citizen is to be connected to the needs of the local community and to support them. We believe that part of the mandate as corporate citizens includes leveraging our core competencies to effectively support the causes we are passionate about.\n\nUltimately, a good CSR strategy should allow businesses to give back to the community in a sustainable manner. Courts is strongly committed to lending a helping hand to families and children in need. We are also avid supporters of football and champion the development of local football. Through close collaboration with grassroots and non-profit organisations, we are better able to use our business expertise, networks and resources to support these causes. We also actively engage our employees, customers and business partners to share in our CSR narrative and be part of the larger community spirit.\n\nTo us, CSR is not about doing good, but doing what's right.\n\nPiyush Gupta\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nDBS\n\nBANKS have an important role to play; we have the power to transform lives and livelihoods in the community. At DBS, we are of the view that we share a symbiotic relationship with the societies and communities which we operate in.\n\nApart from creating long-term economic value, we seek to positively benefit the communities we are present in and deliver social value. We believe in being a force for good and we champion social entrepreneurship across the region, recognising that social enterprises (SEs) provide innovative and sustainable solutions to challenges in Asia.\n\nWe have showcased more than 200 SEs and have given out close to S$2 million in grants to encourage the development of this sector. We are proud to be the only bank in Asia to offer virtually free banking services to social enterprises through the DBS Social Enterprise Package.\n\nTo address the region's evolving social needs, we recently set up a S$50 million foundation to strengthen our corporate social responsibility efforts and effectively scale up our support for communities in Singapore and Asia.\n\nGeraint Hughes\n\nManaging Partner - Singapore\n\nClifford Chance\n\nEXPECTATIONS of corporate behaviour have broadened considerably in recent years and at Clifford Chance in Singapore, we have a cohesive approach to connecting with our community.\n\nOur aim is to harness the ideas, energy and professionalism of our team and to match our efforts to local social needs. Staff at all levels of our business are encouraged to take part in a range of different ways that suit their skills and interest, with examples ranging from legal advice to charities, to fund raising through to participating in community schemes - in each case, employing the same professionalism and energy that we apply to advising our clients on a day-to-day basis.\n\nOur CSR efforts are focused primarily on three key themes - widening access to education; justice; and finance. These three themes underpin the work of the Clifford Chance Foundation, our official channel for giving. Our aim each year is to make a meaningful difference to 100,000 people globally - including in Singapore and throughout South-east Asia.\n\nIngrid Sidiadinoto\n\nManaging Director\n\nUPS Singapore\n\nAT UPS, we have long believed that we grow not only by investing in our business but also in our people and our communities. We believe the best way to give back is to draw upon our company's unique business assets: linking philanthropic dollars with our logistics expertise, transportation assets and the skills and passions of our global employees. Our UPSers are always in the forefront speaking to our clients, listening and understanding the community's needs. We believe that by living and working in the communities we serve, our employees are in touch with the needs and issues in the communities\n\nThrough various CSR activities, our UPSers are given opportunities to lead and take part in projects that are different from their daily responsibilities. This gives them a chance to try something new, expand their roles within the company and connect with colleagues from different departments. All these have proved to build stronger staff morale within UPS and enhance their sense of belonging to the company.\n\nJanet Ang\n\nManaging Director\n\nIBM Singapore\n\nIBM believes in giving back to the community in the best way we know how: by volunteering our skills, expertise and technology. From helping to build the smarter cities of our rapidly urbanising planet to deploying employees to developing markets to make communities more sustainable, we have taken a thoughtful, comprehensive approach to corporate responsibility that aligns with IBM's values and maximises the impact we can make as a global enterprise. As we continue to connect and engage with the community, we hope to inspire an active volunteering community that fosters social cohesion and promote the spirit of giving.\n\nLito Camacho\n\nVice-Chairman Asia Pacific and Singapore CEO\n\nCredit Suisse\n\nAT Credit Suisse, education is one of the primary focus areas among our corporate giving and volunteering initiatives. We have focused our support on numerous education projects around the region from infrastructure building to student scholarships and teachers' training. As an organisation with diverse talent and expertise, our employees also use their professional skills to help our partners in capacity building initiatives such as research, impact assessment, data collection and risk evaluation. Credit Suisse's philanthropic commitments demonstrate that companies are dependent on the existence of a stable environment both for themselves and their employees. We, therefore, support a variety of causes in the areas of education and social welfare through collaboration, strategic partnerships and community outreach efforts, to help improve the lives of disadvantaged people in locations where we do business. These initiatives can only be successful through the commitment of our senior management, employees and community partners.\n\nJoshua Yim\n\nCEO\n\nAchieve Group\n\nOFFERING employment to two groups in particular - the elderly and people with disabilities - is a much more holistic approach than just giving them handouts. Despite their challenges such as age and physical disabilities, many of them still have a capacity to contribute in certain roles so companies should look into offering them opportunities that will bring out their talents and abilities. Over the years, I've witnessed many companies offering employment to people with disabilities in areas such as call-centre work and back-end office administration. These are very good initiatives which I hope more companies can adopt. Another way that society can help these individuals as well as other groups such as ex-offenders is by giving them entrepreneurship opportunities. It could be a very simple franchise run as a one- or two-man show such as a hawker stall, for instance. I've come across groups, be it government agencies or non-governmental organisations, that help such individuals who have an entrepreneurial spirit to seek funds to start up their own small businesses or social enterprises. In this day and age, the more enlightened companies understand that doing business is no longer just about making profits. They know they have a social responsibility to give back to the society they operate in. There is also a lot of public recognition for companies that are strong in CSR these days. Besides being good for the company's reputation, CSR activities can help to cultivate a more caring culture within the company.\n\nTeo Lay Lim\n\nSenior Managing Director\n\nAccenture, Asean\n\nCORPORATE citizenship is fundamental to Accenture's character and the way we run our company. The goal of Accenture's global CSR programme, Skills to Succeed, is to equip 500,000 people around the world by 2015 with the skills to get a job or build a business. This initiative draws on one of Accenture's core competencies - training talent - to help address the need for skills that open doors to employment. At the same time, Skills to Succeed harnesses the powerful combination of our financial support, pro bono contributions of time and employee skills to make a difference in our local communities.\n\nToday, the need is greater than ever to have the right skills to build confidence and capabilities that will open doors to employment for the young and underprivileged people. Additionally, Skills to Succeed engages and inspires our people, clients, recruits, strategic partners and the people whose lives we change. Together we have the opportunity to create an measurable impact that is greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nMichael Zink\n\nHead of Asean and Citi Country Officer\n\nSingapore\n\nWHEN corporate giving is aligned with our business expertise and the skills of our employees, we are able to generate greater impact in the meeting of social needs. At Citi, financial literacy is the cornerstone of our corporate citizenship efforts as it is a natural extension of the work we do as a global financial institution. Through financial literacy, we seek to enable progress in the communities that we serve and raise the quality of life for individuals and families as they make more informed and responsible financial decisions.\n\nOver the past 11 years, we have committed more than S$10.8 million from Citi Foundation to financial literacy programmes serving various segments of Singaporeans including youths, young adults, teachers, mature women and the general public. There is also ownership among our employees as they serve as mentors in the programmes as a form of skills-based volunteerism. Thousands of our employees are also engaged in broader community service efforts throughout the year and around our annual Global Community Day. Corporate giving is a part of our corporate citizenship efforts. Under the unifying idea of Responsible Finance, we seek to ensure that our actions are in the interests of our clients, create economic value and are systemically responsible.\n\nTan Tong Hai\n\nCEO\n\nStarHub\n\nTODAY, it is insufficient for a company to focus on providing excellent products and services. Consumers prefer to buy from a company that also does good. Doing good should hence be seen as part of a company's overall branding efforts.\n\nWhen we run any business, we also think of how to grow and sustain it in the long run. Likewise, CSR efforts must be sustainable, firmly rooted into the corporate culture and transform the company's behaviour in the longer term. To do so, CSR must be driven by more than a few individuals.\n\nStarHub is one of the few companies in the world which have one division taking care of CSR - Marketing, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. This expands the budgetary and manpower support for our CSR initiatives. It also ensures that CSR is on top-of-the-mind recall among employees, and as much as possible, incorporated into our marketing efforts.\n\nDr Tan See Leng\n\nManaging Director & CEO, IHH Healthcare\n\nand Group CEO & MD, Parkway Pantai\n\nAS a listed company, we have an obligation to deliver returns for shareholders. That said, we believe delivering social equity is also an important return, which can be achieved through a sustainable CSR. This has to be more than an initiative or a department - CSR has to be at the heart of the business. The most impactful way to make a real difference is to identify activities that are squarely at the nexus of what we do best as a means of fulfilling important social needs - our core assets being hospitals and our expertise being medical care.\n\nGetting this right requires collaboration and commitment across many stakeholders. Since last year, IHH and our largest shareholder Khazanah collectively committed to delivering partial and fully sponsored medical treatment to needy patients in our home markets of Singapore, Malaysia and Turkey. Through the Khazanah IHH Healthcare Fund, we work with charitable and voluntary welfare organisations to identify patients who need assistance. They are cared for by our first-class doctors and medical staff at our hospitals. We're meeting a social need by doing what we do best - and in our view that can only be a good thing for our business.\n\nChris Mead\n\nRegional Director\n\nHays in Singapore\n\nAT Hays, we understand that the right person in the right role can transform an individual's life and transform a business. That is what makes us the ultimate people business and means that a responsibility for the world around us must be at the core of what we do every day.\n\nWe are currently applying our passion for people beyond recruitment to support the Singapore Cancer Society, which is dedicated to minimising the impact of cancer through public education, screening, patient services, financial assistance, research and advocacy.\n\nDuring the past 18 months, Hays has raised about $8,000 through a variety of events and has fostered a strong understanding of the Singapore Cancer Society and its challenges. The people at Hays Singapore are proud of the relationship and will continue to work closely with the organisation.\n\nWhile our business has a low environmental impact, we are committed to achieving continuous improvement in environmental performance and to preventing pollution. We now measure our global carbon footprint for the first time in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Hays is included in the FTSE4Good Global, Europe and UK Indices.\n\nLionel Lee\n\nGroup CEO and Managing Director\n\nEzra Holdings\n\nAT Ezra Holdings, we believe that giving to social needs should be at the heart of a company's ethos and corporate culture. Engaging employees across various levels in altruistic activities have proved to inspire loyalty that importantly translates to talent retention. These activities form the DNA of empathy, patience and humility for every successful company amid the high-stress/high-pressure working environment that industries such as Ezra's offshore oil and gas operate in.\n\nAs companies invest in social capital, they need to build long-lasting relations with their CSR partners and local communities. For example, we have been involved in the ACE@Boon Lay Programme for many years and have been able to engage many kids who may otherwise be unsupervised at home after school.\n\nSustainable involvement brings about tangible outcomes which companies can then feel proud of.\n\nMax Loh\n\nCountry Managing Partner\n\nErnst & Young\n\nCORPORATE giving has a place in business. The benefits of corporate giving are multifold. Beyond the feel-good altruistic factor, the way in which companies conduct their corporate responsibility (CSR) programmes are reflective of the organisation's values, attracting stakeholders and investors who share similar beliefs. Additionally, CSR programmes provide opportunities for employee engagement. Yet often the challenge is in linking CSR to business imperatives and influencing stakeholders on its value. At EY, CSR is core to our purpose of building a better working world. We believe we have a role, at a broad level, in fostering a sustainable environment, developing entrepreneurship and talent, as well as contributing to more robust capital markets where capital flows and employment thrives, while at the same time helping underprivileged groups in our communities.\n\nAllen Ang\n\nGroup Managing Director\n\nAldon Technologies Services\n\nAN effective CSR practice can enhance a company's brand and image. These intangible assets are critical to strengthening the company's reputation as a trusted enterprise, a responsible corporate citizen and as an employer of choice.\n\nAldon Technologies has been giving donations to charitable causes on an ad hoc basis. We would like our staff to volunteer their time and skills for social causes but we do not know where and how to begin. As an SME, we have limited resources to develop a corporate CSR programme. It would be useful for SMEs like us if the National Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) can broaden its scope by offering services to help SMEs develop effective CSR practices that match their resources to community needs.\n\nPhilip Yuen\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nDeloitte Singapore\n\nDELOITTE empowers our employees to not only be leaders in business but also in the community. Our people are strongly encouraged to take part in CSR initiatives like our global Impact Day where we mobilise Deloitte people worldwide to give back to our communities.\n\nWe also support our people through our firm-sponsored Volunteer Club in Singapore or even smaller groups of employees who, on their own time, wish to band together to do their part for the community. This support can come in the form of funding, flexibility in taking time off work as well as encouragement through internal publicity of their efforts. In addition, we volunteer our professional expertise to charitable organisations that need them.\n\nAt Deloitte, our CSR efforts span the entire year, and\u00b7 we believe that creating a strong business and building a better world are not conflicting goals - they are both essential ingredients for long-term success.\n\nKong Chee Min\n\nGroup Chief Executive Officer\n\nCenturion Corporation\n\nCORPORATIONS need to recognise their interdependence with society and local communities, and cultivate a corporate culture that upholds a sense of responsible citizenship. We need to remain aware of best practices in the market and ensure we fully understand how our business impacts society, whether directly or indirectly and whether positively or negatively.\n\nWe believe that corporate social responsibility extends beyond monetary contributions. At Centurion, our CSR begins with having a heart for our people. We understand that we have a responsibility beyond providing for the basic needs and well-being of worker residents who stay at our dormitories. We strive towards giving them a higher quality of life by providing good facilities and organising meaningful activities.\n\nDoing good builds mutual trust and respect between the corporation and the community, which strengthens relationships with key stakeholders and the general public. At times, it is a balancing act for companies to meet the expectations of these various stakeholders but we trust that the creation of not just economic but social capital is needed for a business to prosper in the long-run.\n\nTakeo Shimazu\n\nManaging Director\n\nBrother International Singapore\n\nTHE role of corporations has become more significant in achieving a sustainable society, and the demands and expectations of stakeholders have increased as well. We have a company principle at Brother which is based on the concept of ''Tomoiki'' or co-existence, which supports our longstanding belief in caring for the community.\n\nFor Brother, CSR is a fulfilment of our motto ''At Your Side'' and we see it as a mid- to long-term perspective in order to achieve further growth, establish a trusted global brand and build a company with a strong sense of pride among its employees.\n\nWe carefully identify our CSR activities by evaluating how we can best contribute to three specific areas - society, environment and our customers. This is important for us as the right CSR activities that will encourage participation among employees and, at the same time, provide value and add to the community.\n\nYeoh Oon Jin\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nPwC Singapore\n\nWHY is doing good good for business? Businesses that positively impact the society are not only more relevant and sustainable, they are better perceived by both staff and customers.\n\nCustomers, especially the younger ones, are becoming more environmentally conscious and socially responsible. Some of them are prepared to forsake purchases and even job offers if the organisation does not support the social values they believe in. Organisations which are socially responsible drive both consumer behaviour and employment attractiveness.\n\nThe public is having a growing influence over businesses and is demanding higher standards of responsibility and accountability from them.\n\nAt PwC, we have always been giving time and money through donations, involvement in local and regional community projects and providing pro bono expert assistance to worthy causes. In recent years, we have also been focusing on raising awareness and empowering our staff to suggest ideas to find innovative new ways to reach out to and meet the needs of the local community. The outcome: practical ideas such as changing light bulbs, replacing mattresses, providing entertainment and organising excursions for elderly residents of lower-income neighbourhoods, etc. The list of innovative contributions goes on and we hope that through these initiatives, our staff will develop and embrace a sense of responsibility for the local community.\n\nJulien Le Noble\n\nSenior Managing Director, Head of Asia Pacific\n\nCME Group\n\nAT CME Group, not only do we value the critical role we play in financial markets, we also value being a productive and contributing member of the communities we serve. We take a strong, active role in global corporate social responsibility and community involvement. In 2012, nearly US$5.4 million was contributed through our charitable programmes, corporate foundation and independent foundations that we support.\n\nThe CME Group Community Foundation seeks to provide particular support to three areas of concern: children in need, education and health and human services. We are proud to be a socially responsible organisation that is making a positive and lasting difference in our communities. Locally, we have donated nearly US$40,000 to the Singapore Children's Society, and we have also supported the Truyen Tin Orphanage's fundraiser in Singapore, which helped the Vietnam-based orphanage purchase a school bus for its children.\n\nWe are privileged to partner non-profit organisations throughout the locations where we have a presence, to provide needed services and strengthen local communities. It is important for businesses to be actively involved in championing the causes that they have identified, and help these non-profit organisations fulfil their missions of creating a brighter future for those they serve. We hold the belief that, in order for businesses to thrive, the communities they operate in must also thrive. Organisations that adopt and embrace CSR will benefit from the creation of a more rounded business environment, greater employee engagement and increased customer loyalty.\n\nThomas Bon\n\nChief Executive\n\nOKH Global Ltd\n\nCSR goes beyond charity and philanthropy. And, to better match corporate giving to social needs, enterprises can frame CSR initiatives on a certain social cause/objectives. This will enable the enterprises to monitor and track the relevant outcomes while keeping a check on costs. And if necessary, enterprises can finetune these CSR initiatives without deviating from the objectives.\n\nWhy is doing good ultimately good for business?\n\nThe world has become increasingly interlinked where enterprises' actions will have multiple ripple effects across economies and communities. Doing good is second to our human nature and on this basis, we have made it part of our corporate mission. We strongly believe that, in the long run, we will enjoy enhanced brand reputation, increased customer preference and employee satisfaction, which contributes towards profitability. To co-exist on a long-term sustainable basis, the relationship between enterprises and the community must be mutually beneficial.\n\nTwo key challenges stand out in our CSR initiatives:\n\n* Identifying suitable and relevant CSR initiatives - with the various social causes in the community, we need to carefully identify those that resonate with our objectives.\n\n* Deployment of limited resources - while we are committed to our CSR initiatives, existing business operations would require a significant amount of resources to support. Hence there is always a tradeoff which has to be carefully planned.\n\nHugues Delcourt\n\nCountry Executive, ABN Amro Bank NV. Singapore and CEO of ABN Amro Private Banking Asia & Middle East\n\nIN order for corporations to give back to society effectively, we must have a deep understanding of the wider community we operate in. The environment is continuously changing, and keeping abreast of prevalent societal gaps and current public issues allow MNCs like ours to sharpen our corporate social responsibility strategies to contribute more locally. Putting these insights into practice ensures that a company's resources are being used in the most effective way and this, in itself, contributes to sustainability. Whether a company's efforts involve monetary donations, employees' time, or implementing changes in business practices, a well thought-out and targeted approach is necessary.\n\nBeing one of the oldest banks in Singapore since 1858, ABN Amro has deep roots in Singapore, which is a key market for us. We take cues from ongoing and new national initiatives to understand how we can contribute as a bank, to further propel Singapore's status as an international city. In today's intensely competitive environment, corporations have to be aware of how their businesses impact society, and not just about the bottom line.\n\nThe challenge of ensuring that the needs of various stakeholders are met remains and doing good in society ultimately helps to boost our employee engagement and pride and further cements our strong ties with the community.\n\nJulienne Loh\n\nGeneral Manager, Singapore\n\nMasterCard Worldwide\n\nI AM a strong believer that, to do well, a company must also do good. Having an acute awareness of the community we operate in and being socially responsible is key to the longevity of any business.\n\nMasterCard's CSR efforts focus on two key areas, namely the empowerment of women and children. We continuously look for ways to help women and girls learn skills required to gain economic independence and support families. We established MasterCard MBA Scholarships for Women in 2011 together with SMU to further develop awardees into academically outstanding, business-savvy and socially responsible women. In addition, MasterCard was also the co-creator of Project Inspire: 5 Minutes to Change the World, with UN Women Singapore, which aims to highlight the importance of women's roles in society, and support initiatives that ultimately improve their socio-economic standing. Programmes such as these ensure we provide a hand-up, rather than just a hand-out, which is sometimes a challenge when doing good.\n\nWe also want to encourage responsible spending. MasterCard's survey on ethical spending in 2013 showed that, on average, one in three respondents in Singapore had purchased an item simply because a percentage of its sale was donated to a good cause. This finding supports MasterCard Purchase with Purpose initiatives, which sees MasterCard contributing to charitable causes each time a consumer uses his MasterCard card.\n\nMartin Hayes\n\nPresident\n\nBosch Southeast Asia\n\nENTERPRISES need to formulate CSR strategies tailored for the communities that they are present in to maximise impact and build local trust. Alongside the initiatives centrally coordinated from the Robert Bosch foundation in Stuttgart, Germany, we also adopt a local-for-local strategy. We collaborate with charitable organisations that operate at the grassroots level to better understand the inherent difficulties and challenges of our beneficiaries, and to ensure that our efforts benefit them directly. When we organised a food drive for World Environment Day in 2013, we also conducted an information session to communicate transparently who the beneficiaries will be and how they will be impacted through our efforts. This transparency provides trust and confidence, which amplifies the amount of support rendered.\n\nBosch supports the local communities where we are present in to advocate the moral, physical and intellectual development of the people. In the wake of events such as the 2004 tsunami and, more recently, Typhoon Haiyan, we focused our efforts on re-establishing schools and libraries. It is our firm belief that education is critical to the growth and development of any society.\n\nSeah Kian Peng\n\nCEO (Singapore)\n\nNTUC Fairprice Co-operative Ltd\n\nCUSTOMERS today are more aware of the various social and community causes and are more likely to engage with organisations that are aligned with their values. A socially responsible organisation resonates better with customers, increases brand loyalty, and is recognised as a responsible employer too. CSR is, therefore, about creating a positive impact on the triple bottom line - people, planet and profits. For most companies, the challenge of developing a CSR programme lies in identifying the right cause to support which aligns the company's belief against the needs of society. At FairPrice, we adopt a holistic approach that embraces corporate philanthropy, protecting the environment, responsible retailing and staff volunteerism as part of our CSR framework. One key focus of our CSR initiative that goes beyond our social mission to moderate the cost of living, is to help the poor and needy through both volunteerism and philanthropy. We have a robust volunteer programme that encourages and facilitates staff participation in over 70 volunteer activities, clocking more than 2,300 volunteer hours last year, while FairPrice Foundation has donated in excess of $49m to help the less fortunate since its inception in 2008. We are guided by our corporate philosophy to do well and to do good, and with the support of our customers, we aim to build a better life for all.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPLAN-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\nTODAY, the playing field for beneficiaries of corporate giving can be levelled more. Many of the beneficiaries with well-known corporate donors behind them, and with more publicity, tend to receive more than they need. Enterprises can better match their corporate giving to social needs by spending more time to find out which are the charities with more compelling causes and who need the most funding and urgently. The essence and thrust of corporate giving must be to direct it to where it makes the most impact. In this regard, it makes sense to consult key stakeholders such as National Volunteerism and Philantrophy Centre in our giving eco-system, as part of the necessary homework needed for impactful and meaningful corporate giving. Regular corporate donors and sponsors continue to be victims of donor fatigue. To alleviate this, beneficiaries of corporate giving should widen their sources of funding and giving. Apart from expanding the reach in the private sector (businesses), charitable organisations and VWOs must also not hesitate to reach out more to the public sector (civil servants) and people sector (individuals). Corporate giving should not be undertaken only for the good of the business, but be driven more by the altruistic desire to help those who need it most. Giving is never enough to satisfy all the compelling needs out there, but when more businesses give, in line with their capabilities and capacities, the pressure on corporate giving can be lightened and it becomes more fulfilling, while ensuring a more equitable distribution of benefits to those who need it most. That said, giving in Singapore will take root when all 3Ps play their part.\n\nDora Hoan\n\nCo-Chairman/Group CEO\n\nBest World International Ltd\n\nSOCIAL needs are best studied by voluntary welfare organisations. They have worked closely with the needy people and are in a better position to help. Therefore, enterprises can address social needs by working with these organisations. As there are various voluntary organisations working for numerous causes, enterprises would need to evaluate them and decide where to give. For whatever reasons, charitable deeds can help businesses build up positive images. With social media, the good reputation can be magnified. However, just as businesses want good reputation, VWOs are also mindful of their branding, i.e. they are selective of their corporate partners. Hence, there have been times when joint initiatives fell through because they were not in line with the VWOs' objectives. This could be resolved if businesses are conscientious of their branding and work with VWOs that are complementary to their industries.\n\nDumont Jean-Michel\n\nChairman\n\nRuder Finn Asia\n\nIN today's globalised economy, companies' licences to operate come as much from the governments as from the communities where they operate in. We have helped businesses across the region develop their CSR strategies and the perceived lack of return on investments is often the main challenge that stops them from deploying CSR initiatives. However when done correctly, meaningful CSR generates immense reputational benefits for the company which translates to greater competitive advantage in a number of ways. Additionally to creating a goodwill shield in the event of a crisis, benefits include attraction and retention of better talent, especially among a younger generation who is more inclined to join socially responsible organisations. Involving employees and tapping their individual talents is also one of the best forms of corporate giving and ensures alignment with social needs. As importantly, good CSR has the ability to strengthen business partnerships and engagement among like-minded companies. Aligning the CSR strategy with the company's broader vision allows one to design cross-company measurements that actually show a positive return on investment as opposed to a cost impact.\n\nLeong Yee May\n\nSenior Vice-President, Asia Pacific\n\nOrange Business Services\n\nWHILE we all know CSR initiatives are integral to corporate identity, our efforts need to be effective, addressing genuine social needs. Strategic CSR initiatives may enhance an organisation's reputation, but in order for CSR to be effective for beneficiaries, enterprises need to engage in a social purpose that leverages a business' skills and operational competencies.\n\nAs part of the outreach efforts, Orange reaches out by supporting through our expertise in the field of communications apart from voluntary work and philanthropic activities. Being a communications integrator, our mission is to create links between individuals and make communication easier for those who are excluded for reasons such as health, handicap, and/or economic situations. We recognise the ubiquity of digital technology and its significance as an essential learning tool and leveller in education. Orange Foundation leads our philanthropic efforts globally, making digital technology accessible to everyone through workshops, healthcare, education, providing schools in developing countries with IT equipment and training. For example, Orange has provided downloadable tools for people with autism, and 730 workshops were held as part of our digital solidarity programme. We are also supporting philanthropic missions across Asia Pacific.\n\nBut well-intentioned projects can generate unintended operational consequences, such as failure to integrate CSR objectives into business priorities, inadequate staff education, among others. Enterprises must do the necessary groundwork to ensure full compliance of environment, health, safety and other regulations related to the target project, and to avoid being blindsided by unintended outcomes.\n\nEnterprises may be tempted to identify social priorities and simply act on those, but by aligning corporate giving with the company's expertise, they can be more productive and demonstrate social responsibility through active engagement.\n\nRoland Smith\n\nVice-President\n\nCenter for Creative Leadership (CCL), APAC\n\nAT CCL, we believe that it should be about both a better bottom line AND making a positive societal and environmental impact - the Triple Bottom Line. We are driven by a mission to advance the understanding, practice and development of leadership for the benefit of society worldwide, and everything we do is in service to that mission.\n\nOrganisations often think that business and CSR initiatives are an ''either-or'' situation, when in fact, organisations should take an ''AND'' approach. A major challenge that most organisations face is recognising how polarities can be complimentary and interdependent, and figuring out how to implement a sustainable ''AND'' strategy. Because of its delicate nature, it requires innovative thinking, and can be time and energy consuming. If handled incorrectly, it can lead to organisations leaning on one aspect over the other, especially in the longrun. However, organisations should remain resolute and disciplined to reap the benefits, business or otherwise. The lessons of experience we learnt is - the more leaders lead responsibly, the more engaged and productive employees will be and the organisation, in turn, will earn other's respect.\n\nHerbert Vongpusanachai\n\nManaging Director\n\nDHL Express (Singapore)\n\nSOCIAL responsibility is an essential consideration for businesses today as it guides our actions as an organisation and ensures long-term success for the company by building trust with the community we live in and increasing employee engagement.\n\nTo create significant and lasting impact in our society, it is important for enterprises to build a corporate culture which infuses daily work with the commitment to better our society. This is a critical element that companies need to consider when creating CSR initiatives as it allows them to capitalise on their core competencies to achieve the greatest effect.\n\nFor DHL Express, we are leveraging our logistics expertise in our GoHelp initiative, which focuses on transporting humanitarian aid to disaster areas. As a global logistics provider, we are also committed to minimising our impact on the environment and reduce our carbon footprint through our GoGreen programme. In addition, our GoTeach initiative champions education for the less privileged, allowing us to cultivate long-term benefits in our community.\n\nBy intertwining social responsibility and business success, we ensure that DHL and our employees assume a more active and enduring role in the advancement of our society.\n\nCheng Heng Chew\n\nSingapore Country Manager\n\nAmerican Express\n\nALIGN the CSR strategy with the values of the company, and assess what social needs there are to which the company and its employees can bring the biggest impact - that's key to executing a meaningful corporate giving programme. Giving back to the communities where our employees and customers live and work has been a corporate value at American Express since our founding. Today, serving our community is not only integral to running a business successfully, it also helps to enhance our reputation and engagement with employees, customers, business partners and other stakeholders.\n\nGlobally, American Express supports three giving platforms: leadership, historic preservation and community service. In Singapore, we engage our employees as volunteers and pro bono consultants to support these causes. Some of our recent activities include serving Lo Hei dinner for elderly residents to celebrate Chinese New Year, and conducting financial education classes for underprivileged children.\n\nThe challenge is how to develop a long-term CSR programme and yet continue to innovate, in order to engage both our beneficiaries and employees. After all, what matters most is the positive impact we can bring to the community in the long run.\n\nJohn Keung\n\nCEO\n\nBCA\n\nTHE Building and Construction Authority (BCA) plays a key role in shaping a user-friendly and sustainable built environment. Making our built environment more accessible improves the mobility of people with diverse needs and promotes a more inclusive society, while green buildings help to reduce the impact on the environment and conserve energy. BCA has also been partnering the built environment sector on CSR and giving back to society. One example is our partnership with the industry to raise funds for the President's Challenge. The built environment sector is also in a unique position to help the less fortunate beyond time and money. For example, BCA and the Singapore Contractors Association, together with their members and material sponsors, helped the Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped with an extensive renovation and makeover of their building. Within BCA, our CSR activities have even been extended to involve families of our employees as well as students at the BCA Academy. Ultimately, caring for and being responsible to our environment and community is a meaningful cause and I would like to encourage businesses and all our stakeholders from the built environment sector to join us in future CSR activities.\n\nKoh Lian Hock\n\nCEO\n\nLien AID\n\nFROM an NGO perspective, there are tangible and intangible benefits for enterprises to practise corporate social responsibility (CSR) both financially and in terms of skilled volunteerism, to help the needy in Singapore and in the region. This not only benefits communities at the receiving end, enterprises also find themselves gaining value from the experiences.\n\nLien AID focuses on providing access to clean water and sanitation for rural communities in Asia and we have seen corporations support the work financially as well as send teams to the locations to help implement water projects according to their expertise. We have received positive feedback from enterprises that they found their employees more bonded as a result of working together for a good cause. Companies also help to build well-rounded employees in the CSR activities, which goes a long way in the staff's development.\n\nJessica Tan\n\nManaging Director\n\nMicrosoft Singapore\n\nAT Microsoft, we believe that corporate responsibility goes beyond fund-raising initiatives. It is a company-wide effort that is committed to making a difference. A challenge we face is finding the right opportunities where we can use our technology to make a positive difference. We believe that this effort cannot be achieved alone. Over the years, we have worked closely with our employees, business partners and stakeholders to explore ways to enable people from all walks of life to pick up skills and knowledge that would help them to improve their lives, bridge the digital divide and enhance their employability in the long run. These partnerships have enabled us to scale and sustain our efforts. In Singapore, with the world's third fastest ageing population, our seniors need to remain relevant and connected in this fast-changing world. Working closely with relevant NGOs and government agencies, we have introduced technology skills to more than 15,000 seniors. Along the way, this has helped nurture a community of digitally active and workforce-ready seniors. With the Society for the Physically Disabled (SPD), and with our partners through our efforts at the Infocomm Development Centre, nearly 2,000 persons with disabilities have been trained with basic technology skills, with 350 of them equipped with vocational skills. This has enabled 37 of them to find employment.\n\nChris Comer\n\nCEO and Property Developer\n\nCastlewood Group\n\nIT'S 25 years since the first Corporate Social Responsibility report was published, and that was by ice-cream makers Ben & Jerry's; the first major corporation to follow was Shell some nine years later. Within Castlewood Group, we have embraced CSR since our inception. As a company, every member of our staff makes voluntary cash contributions monthly, deducted at source, and matched by the company. Our hotel projects follow a strict green eco-friendly carbon-neutral design and operations policy, and our Construction Code of Practice insists upon the use of local workforce and locally sourced and produced materials. Our social conscience initiatives for 2014 include a programme of ''Personnel Involvement'' as it was felt that the giving of time, gaining ''face to face'' exposure to social causes, would benefit the development of our staff, making them more socially responsible and aware, creating valuable members of society while making a valuable contribution and difference in the community. We welcome opportunities to increase our community involvement as it is all part of Castlewood Group's ''paying it forward''.\n\nChristophe Duchatellier\n\nCEO\n\nAdecco Asia\n\nCOMPANIES can help by understanding the challenges that society is facing. This could vary from environmental changes to socio-economic reforms. Giving back to society within the communities we operate in has become the norm for many businesses. Some examples would be to partner local non-profit organisations as well as with government bodies to conduct focus groups and other outreach activities - these could be a purely financial contribution or other ways including volunteerism and community service. The benefits of a strong CSR culture have been intangible both in helping to attract and retain talent as an Employer of Choice but also serving to enhance brand value. We have seen several examples of companies ''doing good'' and the strong relationships they have created within their communities through regular engagement. However, organisations also face challenges which include apathy and indifference from their employees. Some ways in which management and HR can help bridge this gap include regular and transparent communication, as well as creating employee networks to help promote causes through employee-centric programmes.\n\nToby Fowlston\n\nManaging Director, Singapore\n\nRobert Walters (Singapore)\n\nIN the keen competition for quality local talent, companies are increasingly looking at their employer branding in the market. A socially responsible organisation will not only benefit from a highly positive corporate reputation, the goodwill it builds with its robust corporate governance and activities can also attract, keep and develop people. Salaries and job responsibilities aside, professionals today are looking for more rewarding aspects of their career. By being increasingly active in this space, companies are likely to be more socially aware. This allows them to align their CSR efforts with their corporate philosophy and maximise contributions to the right causes. With most companies, the biggest challenge is in trying to make financial sense of the contributions as well as buy-in from senior management. Fortunately in Robert Walters, we have top-down initiatives such as the annual Global Charity Day which supports a local charity. While contributing to the local community it also creates a sense of focus and achievement for a specific day in the year amongst our employees.\n\nLeon Leon Perera\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nSpire Research & Consulting Group\n\nDOING good ultimately benefits companies by winning over customers, attracting and retaining employees as well as attracting the growing number of ethical investment funds. While all these advantages may not be decisive right now, they will become more important in the future as societal norms evolve. To avoid a mismatch between corporate giving and social needs, corporates need to better engage with non-profits to share goals and constraints, so as to align on areas where there is the closest fit. This conversation on goals should precede conversations about concrete activities. In Spire, most of our employees are involved in at least one CSR programme. We continue to strive to learn from past activities and to align employee preferences with company goals.\n\nDirk-Peter van Leeuwen\n\nSenior Vice-President and General Manager\n\nRed Hat Asia Pacific\n\nCSR activities can help enterprises nurture leaders with a strong sense of commitment and responsibility in giving back to the communities. Red Hat believes that the community efforts we do go beyond helping those in need. It also creates a sense of fellowship among the employees at the same time, bringing us together to make a difference.\n\nFor donations, we look at areas of basic needs, education, technology and health, and we also have annual events that allow us to support a good cause while building brand awareness within the communities. We want to make sure that everyone at Red Hat can participate in our CSR programmes because, at the end of the day, we want to drive a long-term value to everything that we do.\n\nDhirendra Shantilal\n\nBoard Director & Head of Asia Pacific\n\nFircroft\n\nTODAY, being a socially responsible enterprise is no longer optional; it's absolutely essential. With educated consumer communities demanding better from their brands, enterprises need to understand that corporate giving can no longer be an afterthought. This integration of corporate citizenship into the corporation has benefits beyond the immediate gratification of doing good - CSR policies that are aligned with the business objectives and strengths of the enterprise are good for the bottom-line. Socially responsibly companies are better placed to attract and retain talent - because the talented of this generation are drawn to enterprises that are making a positive difference to the world at large. As a recruitment firm in the oil, gas and energy industry, we operate in a sector that is closely scrutinised for its CSR policies. The companies we place talent with recognise the significant environmental and social challenges faced by society and are committed to ethical business practices. Anything short of this will lead to CSR policies that are more decorative than useful - for both our people and their profit.\n\nHari Krishnan\n\nManaging Director - Asia Pacific and Japan\n\nLinkedIn\n\nMOST of us want to contribute to social causes, and this is underscored by a recent survey which shows that 82 per cent of LinkedIn members want to volunteer their time and skills. The gap between action and inaction is sometimes due to time constraints or lack of awareness of opportunities to make a difference.\n\nAt LinkedIn, we believe we can leverage what we do best as a business - connect talent with opportunity at massive scale - to positively impact the non-profit sector, by helping them find talent to drive their causes for example. Our ''LinkedIn for Good'' efforts aim to connect our employees and more than 277 million members globally with opportunities, from volunteering projects to more strategic board positions within non-profit organisations.\n\nAn impactful CSR programme is one that aligns the business' actions to its mission and values. This unlocks synergies which can result in immense social value, and in the process, benefit the business as it strengthens its connectivities within the communities it operates in.\n\nJoshua Soh\n\nManaging Director for Singapore and Brunei\n\nCisco\n\nTHE success of our nation is based on several factors, one of which is social investments. By creating value in our society, we can nurture strong relationships built on trust with customers, partners, stakeholders and the community we operate in. It is great to see many companies dedicated to improving lives and building thriving communities through initiatives, including the President's Challenge.\n\nWhen investing in CSR efforts, our focus needs to be on areas where our expertise, resources and technology can have the most impact and self-sustaining effect. That is why the social investments by Cisco are in transforming education, connected healthcare, economic empowerment, preserving the environment and social support. We look for opportunities to help our partner organisations succeed far beyond what we have invested - by putting skills, confidence, and empowerment into the hands of people. And that is the philosophy behind the Cisco Networking Academy programme. We help build tomorrow's workforce by developing highly skilled network professionals to support local industries and have trained more than five million students in 9,000 academies operating in 170 countries.\n\nWe transform lives, communities and the planet working through the combined power of human collaboration and networked connections. That's impact multiplied.\n\nAnne Tong\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nHSR International Realtors\n\nIN order for corporate social responsibility to create impact, it should be consistent and sustainable. CSR is clearly outlined in our mission - ''As a responsible corporate citizen, we take pride in contributing towards the development of the community.'' We believe that as a successful business, it is our social obligation to help the less fortunate among us. Participating in CSR activities enables our salespersons and staff to build strong character, which translates into how they perform at work - with honesty, integrity and a genuine willingness to serve other people; key qualities that customers look for in a real-estate agent. This ultimately reinforces our brand-building efforts. With Singapore being an ageing nation with many citizens who require financial assistance, we have dedicated our CSR efforts to these groups of people. Two of our main programmes, Home Meal Service and Agape Ration Service, involve delivering fresh meals to needy families as well as giving out essential rations on a regular basis. We also offer support to the elderly by organising excursions, wellness checks and social activities. In implementing our programmes, the amount of resources and having sufficient volunteers are our main challenges. Nevertheless, we will continue to build and strengthen our charitable efforts, as we feel it is important as a corporate body to strike a balance between our CSR initiatives and overall business objectives.\n\nSam Yap\n\nGroup Executive Chairman and Co-Founder\n\nHtwo Investment Holdings Pte Ltd\n\nCOMMUNITY involvement and community service has always been a value adopted by Htwo Investment Holdings in our business activities. This value is well-ingrained among our staff.\n\nHtwo Holdings commits to integrate CSR into our decision-making process to achieve wider economic, community and environmental impact in which we operate. CSR will enhance our ability to pursue our business successfully in the long term.\n\nAs part of its CSR efforts, Htwo Holdings implements:\n\n* Environmentally friendly practices in our business processes and activities;\n\n* Fair labour-management and employment practices;\n\n* Employee volunteerism and community service to the disadvantaged and needy; and\n\n* Family-friendly practices.\n\nThis year, our employees organised a charity dinner for residents of a children's home. Senior citizens were invited to join in and have fun in a colourful event where they received gifts for the festive period. CSR programmes are not only useful to recipients but also for the staff as it deepens their awareness of the social and community landscape and encourage the spirit of sharing and caring among themselves.\n\nDavid Low\n\nCEO\n\nFuturistic Store Fixtures\n\nCSR is fast becoming a business unit of its own, especially for established corporations with a larger headcount as well as for industries with direct touch points with end-users. Futuristic Store Fixtures services a portfolio of fast-moving retail brands and many of our clients have strict protocols for CSR which further drives our CSR directives. We set aside an annual budget for CSR initiatives, which includes staff volunteering, events planning and execution with homes for the underprivileged and the medically needy, apart from upfront monetary contributions. Being socially responsible is part of our branding; we ensure that quality fixtures and services are delivered with a green conscience. Having CSR ingrained in our branding creates a culture of sharing and giving in the workforce. This encourages compassion within the workforce, not only towards the organisations we choose to adopt but also towards co-workers, which enhances social bonding, thus creating a more conducive working environment. Mobilisation of manpower for activities without disruption to employees' work and personal lives remains a challenge, along with the allocation of funds in tighter financial times.\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services\n\nIT is wonderful that more and more companies have been realising the importance of CSR and adopting such initiatives in recent years. Besides monetary donations, which are certainly crucial, staff volunteering is perhaps more meaningful as the volunteers get to relate on a personal level to the beneficiaries, be they underprivileged families, children, youth, the elderly and people with disabilities. To this end, companies could grant employees official time off for CSR activities, such as allowing them one working day off a month specifically to pursue volunteer work with a VWO of their choosing. Naturally, such an initiative is especially challenging for SMEs as they are already feeling the pressure of escalating business costs amid the economic restructuring that Singapore is undergoing. At PrimeStaff, CSR is a strong component of our company culture. Lending our support to children and youth, particularly those who have been neglected and abused, is something that is close to our hearts. Our appointed charities include the Singapore Children's Society and the Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund, among others. On a company level, we often take part in CSR events such as charity runs/walks and strongly encourage our employees to join in. I personally believe that when individuals have more exposure to those less fortunate in the community, it helps to build character and makes them more well-rounded individuals who not only care about material wealth but about their fellow man too. It is thus my hope that through these growing CSR efforts, Singapore can start to transform into a more caring society.\n\nRobin C Lee\n\nGroup COO\n\nBok Seng Group\n\nAROUND the world, achieving Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is becoming a major goal for most companies. To do so, companies have to manage the social, environmental and economic impacts of their actions and be responsive to those who may be affected by their business operations. These responsibilities range from being more environmentally friendly to doing philanthropic work. In most large enterprises, there is often the challenge of pursuing profit-driven objectives while at the same time having to maintain the compassionate human aspect which improves a company's branding as well as reputation. As it stands, most large enterprises achieve this through big donations, usually accompanied by media glare, which thus confer branding returns. This does not typically incur too much time commitment on the company's part. There probably isn't as much take-up when it comes to CSR activities that involve the volunteering of one's time. I propose that a balance of these activities would be optimal, as it is vital to cultivate from top to the bottom the importance of having compassion and giving back to society with a genuine heart. I'm not criticising the philanthropic decisions of companies but, rather, I strongly feel that actions, helping out on the ground, are just as important as writing cheques. The power of human connection and interaction can never be doubted. Consequently, companies with caring, compassionate employees are often places where there is more teamwork, communication, fun and collective creativity, all keys to a successful business. That is what we in the corporate community should strive for and achieve.\n\nZaheer K Merchant\n\nRegional Director (Singapore and Europe)\n\nQi Group of Companies\n\nSOCIAL needs calls for understanding and compassion. Aside from achieving profits, which is important, companies should also focus on building a workforce that is gracious and selfless in society, and relevant to its needs. Organisations such as Singapore Compact (part of United Nations Global Compact) place strong emphasis on creating awareness and helping to build sustainable development for businesses and stakeholders in today's society. Having staff interested and involved in CSR programmes is beneficial to build resilience and an overall corporate image. Our group has several corporate volunteering programmes in place where employees work directly with non-profit and voluntary welfare organisations to better the lives of others. We have found that once employees see the positive difference they can make in others' lives, it makes them more understanding and respectful of the community they live in. It compels working towards bigger change. Ultimately, values such as generosity and the pursuit of social justice are what make a society proud of itself. We hope it will result in a society that gives, and not just takes.\n\nDavid Leong\n\nManaging Director\n\nPeopleWorldwide Consulting\n\nCORPORATE social responsibility is not about good business. It is about doing the right thing. When businesses do the right things and align their business bearings with certain principles - to have good CSR - the employees will also get the same sense of doing the right thing. Whether it is ethical, social, commercial or personal, doing the right thing is key. It is about setting an equilibrium in ethical standards and being accountable to all stakeholders. Correct CSR culture will rub off on employees as good ethical behavior and that will be the biggest benefit for companies - to have more employees doing the right thing.\n\nRob Bratby\n\nManaging Partner\n\nOlswang Asia\n\nAT Olswang, we have a saying that ''law is what we do but CSR is who we are''. CSR is not something we do because we have to or just because others do it but because it is integral to our beliefs and approach to doing business. CSR brings many benefits to those we work with, our staff, our morale and focus on innovation and collaboration. Our projects have also helped us to build stronger partnerships with clients and in the sectors in which we work. There are many opportunities to engage in fantastic CSR opportunities in Singapore. We have chosen to work closely with the social enterprise sector which is aligned with the skills we can offer as a business. South-east Asia has a great scheme which we have helped develop which guides organisations by matching them with suitable social enterprises and helping them develop mutually beneficial relationships. I would urge companies to explore those opportunities in addition to the more obvious charity and volunteering options.\n\nEric Hoh\n\nVice President, Asia South & Korea Regions\n\nSymantec\n\nSymantec's core business objective is the protection of information, and we help people, businesses and governments safeguard against the growing cyber risks of the digital age. To meet the long-term needs of our stakeholders, we have invested to stay at the forefront of the security threat landscape.\n\nWe are also committed to educate the wider community against cyber security risks, and have partnered with Fei Yue Community Services to run a school-based online safety programme. This commitment to give back to the community extends beyond the online space, and we provide our employees with hands-on experiences -- such as by matching our corporate donations to the amount of time staff volunteer via our Dollars for Doers Programme, and sponsoring 32 trees for the Garden City Fund's Plant-A-Tree Programme.\n\nBy integrating corporate responsibility into our business strategy, we deliver value to our stakeholders, and it also allows us to remain committed to operating ethically and to practice sound environmental management to make a positive impact in the community.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/stroll-through-shopping-mall-sector", "site_title": "A stroll through the shopping mall sector", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nA stroll through the shopping mall sector\n\nThe profitability of retail malls depends on their tenant mix, use of space and population income growth, reports CAI HAOXIANG\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Mar 23, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nDUBLIN has its pubs, London has Trafalgar Square and New York, Times Square. In humid and rainy Singapore, however, the top hang-out spot of choice for food, shopping or leisure is probably the ubiquitous air-conditioned shopping centre.\n\nThere are more than 80 malls in Singapore, scattered over all parts of the island, usually located near an MRT station. What investors might not know is that they can invest in at least a quarter of these and collect dividends through the rental income mall landlords receive. They can also invest in malls in other markets too, such as Hong Kong, China, and Indonesia.\n\nToday, we introduce the drivers of the industry behind the retail real estate investment trust (Reit) sector, which is arguably one of the more stable and defensive sectors in Singapore. This week's piece is focused more on a general look at the industry, its opportunities and challenges. A future piece will describe and evaluate individual retail Reits.\n\nReits are financial vehicles where companies park property assets to enjoy tax advantages. Shopping malls are popular assets to be put into a Reit structure. Reit investors tend to look for stability and income, instead of explosive growth. This is especially true of retail malls, and a subset of retail malls located in Singapore's heartlands known as suburban malls.\n\nAfter all, rents cannot be doubled overnight, and tenancy levels, usually near 100 per cent, have little upside. But shopping centres can still make money.\n\nPerformance drivers\n\nSome factors that drive higher profits are within the control of a Reit manager. The top strategy is what is known in industry jargon as the asset enhancement initiative, or AEI for short.\n\nAEIs are essentially renovation. People renovate their houses to make smarter use of space. They knock down walls to make a room bigger. They give the home a more comfortable and liveable look by laying new tiles, slapping a fresh coat of paint on the walls, and installing high-quality kitchen appliances as well as brighter lights.\n\nSimilarly, a smart mall manager will turn an awkward corner into a mobile accessory shop or bubble tea kiosk; escalators can be shifted to improve traffic flow; carpark space can be turned into shops to generate higher rental income; a more modern look will attract younger shoppers. With so many malls in Singapore, the older ones eventually lose their lustre and have to be renewed.\n\nAnother factor landlords think about is the tenant mix. What shops appear in malls are a two-way process: potential tenants apply for leases, and landlords try to bring in certain coveted brand names. A basement area that would otherwise stay quiet can be livened up by the right mix of popular restaurants and a supermarket. After dinner, people typically buy some groceries before heading home.\n\nControlling the tenant mix is an art as well as a science. The science is in analysing the industry the prospective tenant is in, and the tenant's own business operations. This ensures rent can be paid on time. If the tenant is profitable, rentals can be increased after leases, typically on three-year terms, are up.\n\nThe art is in figuring out what kind of shoppers the mall should focus on attracting, identifying the latest trends and designing the mall and tenant mix accordingly.\n\nHaving the right tenant mix is critical to a mall's performance. Barely one month after the former Iluma mall beside Bugis Junction opened its doors in 2009, some retailers began having discount sales. Perhaps their offerings were too niche. Perhaps Bugis Junction, located on top of Bugis MRT, offered strong competition. A bridge from Bugis Junction also did not link directly to the mall.\n\nIluma's fortunes seem to have turned around after CapitaMall Trust bought it in 2011 for $295 million and spent $38 million revamping it, reopening it in 2012. At end-2013, the mall, now renamed Bugis+, pulled in net property income of $21.3 million - a decent 6.5 per cent net property income yield on its new valuation of $330 million.\n\nExternal factors\n\nWhile mall managers can redesign the mall through AEIs and reshuffle the tenant mix, some factors will remain out of their control.\n\nOne key factor is the mall's location. This can only be controlled when the Reit manager is deciding whether to acquire the mall. Location will impose constraints on shopper flow. Those located right next to MRT stations will have the advantage, be it Bugis Junction and the former Iluma mall, or Somerset 313 versus neighbouring Orchard Central.\n\nRelated to location is who lives nearby. This is referred to as a mall's catchment area. Some malls attract a higher-spending crowd than others, and can thus charge their retailers higher rents.\n\nSuburban malls with grocery chains and movie theatres will always have a captive audience. After a long day at work, it is far more convenient for a family to walk to the nearest shopping centre for dinner, entertainment, and a trip to NTUC FairPrice, than drive or take public transport to another part of town.\n\nAnother factor that is controlled upon purchase is size. Malls that are bigger will have more flexibility to customise their tenant mix and offerings. People are attracted towards and are more likely to spend time in a place where they can do multiple things.\n\nEconomic trends also affect mall performance. Rising median incomes are a boon to suburban malls. People are encouraged to spend more if they are getting promoted and receiving bonuses.\n\nHigher tourist visits will be a positive for malls along the Orchard Road shopping belt. Job creation and economic growth also affect spending patterns.\n\nHow the economy affects a mall depends on the tenant mix. An economic downturn will hit malls with many high-end shops, such as SPH Reit's Paragon, harder than a place catering to the mass market, such as Fraser Centrepoint Trust's Causeway Point.\n\nAn epidemic outbreak, such as Sars, might cause people to stay indoors instead of going out to shop. A mall such as Vivocity, which is near a ferry terminal and transit points to Sentosa island, will be hit more when people do not travel.\n\nA serious economic downturn will make everyone tighten their belts, spending less at expensive restaurants and boutiques.\n\nMarket watchers also examine statistics on the total amount of retail space in Singapore. According to the latest CapitaMall Trust presentation slides, Singapore's retail floor space supply growth is estimated to slow down in the next five years to hit 65.5 million sq ft by 2018 from 61.1 million sq ft in 2013, compared to growth from 54.5 million sq ft in 2009.\n\nA final indicator can be the retail sales index, published by the Department of Statistics. Retail sales growth has been shrinking in the past few years, in line with a slowing economy.\n\nAfter the latest release this year, observers pointed out that shrinking retail sales in the past year might indicate growing usage of e-commerce platforms.\n\nOnline threat\n\nIs online shopping a threat to brick-and-mortar malls? Will retailers be doomed to have their shops become glorified showrooms while savvy consumers compare prices on their smartphones and ultimately make their purchases somewhere else?\n\nIn the US and other parts of the world, people shop online through Amazon and eBay. Estimated quarterly US retail e-commerce sales as a proportion of total quarterly retail sales have grown from 2 per cent in 2004 to 6 per cent today, according to the latest report from the US Census Bureau. Total e-commerce sales for last year were estimated at US$263 billion, up 17 per cent from 2012.\n\nIn China, the biggest player is Alibaba, which controls more than two fifths of the e-commerce market. It sells everything from apples and olive oil to motorcycles and used cars. Businesses around the world use it to run import-export operations. The company is preparing for an initial public offering in the US that values the company at about US$140 billion. Advertisers also use social media such as WeChat to market their products.\n\nIn Singapore, online shopping sites include Qoo10, Rakuten, Singsale, Zalora, mobile site Carousell, and online grocer Redmart. People also shop at British online store ASOS, vintage and handmade item store Etsy, supplement store iHerb, cosmetics supplier Luxola, just to name a few.\n\nThe advantage online shops have over their real-world counterparts is the lower set-up costs. For one thing, they do not have to worry about paying rent.\n\nConsumers also like the convenience of browsing several sites at one go, instead of trudging from shop to shop looking for the best deal. Busy consumers with young children to take care of will find it more convenient to shop from home.\n\nIn addition, the disadvantages that dogged the early years of online shopping such as dodgy suppliers or credit card fraud are disappearing. Online shopping sites are becoming more reputable, consumers can buy from highly-rated suppliers who deliver on time and do not misrepresent their products, and e-payment systems are becoming more secure with payments authenticated through mobile phones and electronic passcode generators.\n\nAs online shopping takes off among a younger generation that grew up with the Internet, the composition of shops at Singapore's malls might change.\n\nCertain items, such as electronics, books and nutritional supplements, can be easily compared online and purchased, with delivery to one's doorstep.\n\nOther shops, notably clothes and shoes retailers, might still have a place in a shopping mall. This is because consumers can touch, see and try out these items on the spot, compared to wondering if digitally-enhanced pictures on the Internet can be trusted.\n\nRestaurants, cinemas and supermarkets are unlikely to be replaced by the online threat.\n\nTo conclude, shopping malls in Singapore are here to stay in the foreseeable future. While they are not exciting investments, they can be reasonably profitable ones. A future piece will examine the 10 or so Reits listed here with exposure to the retail mall sector.\n\nhaoxiang@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The current ballot to approve strike action was due to end on Thursday.\n\nIAG will earn 1.76 billion euros (S$3.09 billion) in operating profit next year, based on seven estimates, in line with the company's 1.8 billion euro goal. For Lufthansa, 10 analysts indicate earnings of 2.09 billion euros, short of the 2.65 billion euros sought.\n\nThe relative success in controlling costs is reflected in the shares, with IAG, as International Consolidated Airlines Group is known in full, gaining 62 per cent in the past year, more than three times Lufthansa's 19 per cent advance.\n\nLufthansa's previous savings drive came up short in 2011, achieving an annual reduction of 640 million euros versus the one billion euros targeted.\n\nThe new plan, aimed to lift operating profit by 1.8 billion euros annually by 2015, now includes measures that might contribute almost three billion euros, Lufthansa says. At IAG, it's probably only a matter of time before the 2015 earnings target is lifted to two billion euros, Donal O'Neill, a Goodbody Stockbrokers analyst in Dublin, said after the company revealed premium traffic grew 5.2 per cent last month, spurred by demand for North Atlantic flights at British Airways.\n\nIAG last year cut 2,507 jobs at Iberia, including 192 pilot posts, with wage and headcount reductions delivering 196 million euros in savings.\n\n\"Analysts were extremely pessimistic on Spain and Iberia, and IAG has shown they can cut costs,\" said Robin Byde, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald in London. \"That has led to a lot of enthusiasm.\"\n\nEntry-level pay at Iberia, which employs 1,300 pilots, has been cut to 35,000 euros a year for new starters, less than half the previous level. Wages for existing pilots have been cut by 14 per cent and frozen until next year, and gains after that will depend on margins at a unit that lost 166 million euros in 2013.\n\nLufthansa, which earned 697 million euros last year, led by a 495 million euro profit at the main passenger airline that Carsten Spohr will lead until he becomes group chief executive officer on May 1, wants more than 5,000 pilots to accept pay rises tied to financial performance for three years.\n\nLufthansa, which has also revised terms for pensions and early retirement, has held 10 rounds of talks with pilots. All the measures are aimed at boosting productivity to enhance competitiveness, personnel manager Peter Gerber said.\n\nEntry-level pay for first officers at the German airline stands at 55,500 euros, or 73,000 with overtime. Senior captains can earn 260,500 euros. Pilots cost Lufthansa one billion euros a year, helping to push annual operating expenses to 30.8 billion euros last year - the highest among 40 carriers in the Bloomberg World Airlines Index. At 30 billion euros, it also had the highest revenue.- Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

The repurchases since June 2013 are the company's first buybacks since the stock was listed in December 2005.

The trade increased his deemed holdings to 483.458 million shares or 72.42 per cent of the issued capital (registered holder is Ho Bee Holdings Pte Ltd).

The stock recorded a price gain six months after on 81 per cent of those purchases. The counter closed at 25 cents on Friday.\n\nTat Hong Holdings\n\nExecutive director Michael Ng Sang Kuey recorded his first on-market trades in heavy equipment services provider Tat Hong Holdings since August 2013 with 203,000 shares purchased from March 18 to 19 at an average of 75.5 cents each.

Those who have, often think the responsibilities are too risky, or something they may not be able to handle.\n\nThe reality can be completely different. An independent directorship can be an uplifting stimulus and provide experiences not normally obtainable in executive life.\n\nIt used to be that stepping into the ranks of independent directorships was like joining an exclusive club - more social than work. I know of one board that used to have a one-hour board meeting ending with a four-hour lunch. I understand this same company now has reversed their priorities with a four-hour board meeting followed by a one-hour lunch.\n\nThe hard fact is that the current corporate environment demands more caution from potential directors before accepting such appointments. This is a direct result of significant enhancements in corporate governance, and the prevalence of corporate failures which have exposed directors to significant potential legal liabilities.\n\nIf you are relatively new to the corporate world, in particular to board matters, a clear understanding of what it means to be a director is essential.\n\nThere are a slew of programmes run by the Singapore Institute of Directors for the professional development of directors, including a starter course: \"So, You Want To Be A Director?\"\n\nThe first question that any prospective independent director should ask is: What can I contribute to the board? More enlightened boards now search wider afield for more diverse candidates, looking beyond the typical cull of accountants, lawyers, politicians or friends. You may well have useful experience whatever your career field.\n\nExperience is just one aspect of a director's effectiveness. An independent director is just that - independent. And preferably one who is articulate and forceful enough to voice concerns and viewpoints that may differ from the other directors on the board.\n\nThe law and codes of corporate governance detail the practice parameters of the independent director's role. Beyond that, it is advisable to avoid accepting appointments where your close friends, golf club \"kakis\", or relatives (however distant), are directors or in the company's management.\n\nIt is prudent for a novice director to start with a smaller company to learn the ropes and gain confidence and experience before joining the boards of larger companies.\n\nUnless you can commit the time to do a proper job, do not accept any board position. There has been much discussion on how many directorships an individual can reasonably cope with. This very much depends on the individual's other time commitments.\n\nIf you are a retiree, your particular corporate experience may make you a prime candidate for a particular board. The right fit extends the retiree's meaningful contributions and adds genuine value for the right company. However, it is also important for more \"senior\" directors to recognise when it may be time for them to step down for effective renewal and succession.\n\nBesides the income from director's fees, a directorship can also provide unexpected and highly engaging forays into new industries and international practices in different countries.\n\nCorporate boards are as diverse as their businesses and their individual members. Accepting directorships on a few boards is one way of benefiting from the varied dynamics and unique characteristics of individual boards and their corporate cultures. It is possible to learn from one board and apply the knowledge to others.\n\nA number of public companies have recently made the headlines with financial difficulties due to fraud, poor management or their inability to cope with economic woes. For someone who seeks a challenge, accepting an appointment to one of these troubled boards and playing an active part in the turn-around process, can be a fulfilling career achievement.\n\nHowever, it pays to do adequate due diligence on the company and your fellow directors before accepting the attendant risks associated with such an appointment. Troubled companies also always involve a more significant time commitment. You may want to make sure you are paid extra for the additional work involved.\n\nUnfortunately, many listed companies here (as elsewhere) still largely rely on friends of existing directors, or people in the \"inner circle\" when choosing directors.\n\nIncreasingly, however, companies are using executive search firms and tapping into independent databases such as those set up by SID in the search for suitable candidates. Therefore, passing the word around that you are willing and available helps.\n\nAn independent directorship on the right board can be a highly satisfying and enlightening cap to a long and enjoyable career. In fact, it can be a great \"second career\".\n\nThe writer is a member of the Publications Committee of the Singapore Institute of Directors\n\nFor more articles, go to\n\nbtd.sg/BMatters\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Members still have to purchase tickets to the stadium's events like everyone else, although they will be given priority to do so ahead of the general public of up to six weeks in advance.\n\nThe price of the ticket is set by the individual event promoter, and will be in line with a \"Category A\" ticket price that will reflect the prime positioning of the Premium Seat blocks, said WSG.\n\nWhat members will get in return are perks such as seats in the north and south wings of the stadium in the prime halfway line viewing position. Their padded seats will have ample legroom and are fitted with armrests and cup-holders.\n\nThey will also enjoy free parking, access to two club lounges and get to dine in a private restaurant. Members can enter the stadium via a VIP lobby and have access to a bespoke concierge service.\n\nAdrian Staiti, senior vice-president (global partnerships and stadiums & arenas) at WSG, told The Business Times that the buyers of the premium seat memberships are a good mix of corporates and individuals.\n\n\"All are eager to be part of the National Stadium Club, a first-of-its-kind stadium membership programme in the region,\" he said, adding that he expected the rest of the 400-odd seats to be bought quite soon.\n\n\"As the list of premiere events grows, we expect to see the remaining premium seats quickly taken up by those looking to share with their friends, family or business partners the experience of attending world-class sports and entertainment events at the iconic Sports Hub,\" said Mr Staiti.\n\nBesides the premium seats, there are separate plans to release a higher category of these memberships for sale. About 400 of these so-called \"platinum\" seats will offer additional privileges on top of what the premium seats offer. WSG said details will be released at a later date.\n\nWSG had also announced last year that it had sold out the National Stadium's 61 available corporate hospitality suites within nine months of their launch. The suites range from eightseats to ones that can hold as many as 30 people, and cost between $72,000 and $272,000 a year.\n\nThe first sporting event at the National Stadium will be the inaugural World Club 10s Rugby, which will feature elite rugby clubs from around the world slugging it out over two days on June 21-22.\n\nThe first football match is set to be a Causeway derby between arch-rivals Singapore and Malaysia on Aug 8, the eve of the Republic's National Day.\n\nThe Sports Hub last month unveiled plans to bring in national teams from Europe, South America and Asia, as well as a top European club, to play matches here as well.\n\nBesides sports, there are a number of entertainment events on the event calendar too, among them the Singapore Chinese Orchestra's attempt to break the world record for the largest number of performers in June, and Taiwan superstar Jay Chou's concert in November.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/ah-be-suburban-mall-owner", "site_title": "Ah, to be a suburban mall owner", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nAh, to be a suburban mall owner\n\nJunction 8, Tampines Mall and Northpoint are among the most profitable malls in Singapore\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Mar 23, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSOMEONE told me once he wanted to come back in his next life as either an insurance company boss or a suburban mall owner. I'm not sure what kind of karma he would have to accumulate in his current life to be bestowed with that good fortune in the next, but it certainly sounds like an agreeable proposition.\n\nWhy not? Certain suburban malls, for example, seem to enjoy a durable competitive advantage - the kind that makes value investors drool over their Porter five forces analyses and discounted cash flow calculations.\n\nA comparison of the profitability of Singapore malls shows that the most profitable tend to be located in suburban centres like Tampines, Bishan and Yishun - suburban in Singapore being defined as a location not within the Central Business District.\n\nA prime example would be Bishan's Junction 8. Around a one-kilometre radius are HDB flats, landed property, condos, industrial buildings, well-known schools like Raffles Institution, Catholic High, St Joseph's Institution, a mosque, a church, a stadium and swimming pool, and a library. There are some eateries and shops by the HDB blocks around it, but the mall has otherwise no competition in sight - the nearest malls are probably AMK Hub and the Toa Payoh Central area. Those two places, arguably, pale in comparison.\n\nLand around Bishan is mostly built up. No alternative malls should be springing up anytime soon. Junction 8 thus has a captive audience of the estimated 65,000 HDB dwellers living nearby and perhaps some of the 109,000 people living in Toa Payoh flats and another 150,000 living in Ang Mo Kio flats as well, not including those living in private property and the students, workers and other people using the various amenities nearby. Bishan is also accessible.\n\nBishan MRT station beside Junction 8 is an interchange for the North-South and Circle lines. Bishan is also a 10-minute train ride away from Orchard, and has a bus interchange too.\n\nShopper traffic in 2012, by the way, was 29.2 million - the third highest among CapitaMall Trust malls after Bugis Junction and Raffles City. This translates to roughly 80,000 people a day.\n\nA tenant that leaves is easily replaced, looking at Junction 8's occupancy history. It was fully occupied for eight of 10 years from 2003 to 2012, through Sars and the global financial crisis, with the only exceptions being 2004 (99.8 per cent occupancy) and 2012 (99.6 per cent). This slipped to 99.4 per cent last year, perhaps reflecting a tougher retail environment as costs rise.\n\nHowever, shopping malls which cater to people's basic needs will have a sustainable advantage, especially in Singapore. People here like to eat out, for instance. The Singaporean weather is hot, humid, and rainy. Shopping malls offer plenty of good food across all price ranges in comfortable settings.\n\nMall tenants cater to a spectrum of needs. By having a tenant mix squarely in the mass market segment, suburban malls ensure a constant stream of visitors. The tenant mix in a place like Junction 8 will give a rough idea of the magic formula required. It has bakeries BreadTalk and Four Leaves, mass market fashion chains Cotton On, G2000 and Giordano, Chinese food like Din Tai Fung and Crystal Jade, DBS Bank, a Food Junction food court, a Golden Village cinema, fast food chains McDonald's, KFC, MOS Burger, Subway, telco shops SingTel, StarHub and M1, a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, a Swensen's ice cream restaurant, Best Denki and Challenger for electronics, Japanese food chains like Sakae Sushi, shops selling crocs, flip flops, a Cristofori Music School and an NTUC supermarket in the basement.\n\nSuburban malls do not need unique, quirky boutiques and fine dining restaurants to be profitable. By being the only mall around and catering to basic needs of people living nearby, they will do just fine - especially when located in a densely populated, middle to upper-middle class area like Bishan.\n\nIt is thus no surprise that the mall is doing just fine, with one of the highest net property income (NPI) per square foot of net lettable area (NLA) among malls in Singapore's listed Reits. Based on latest figures, the mall generated net property income of $157 per square foot in 2013.\n\nThis is akin to renting out a 1,000 sq ft condominium and enjoying $157,000 in profit a year after the deduction of maintenance expenses and property management fees, before mortgage payments and other costs.\n\nThis works out to takings of roughly $13,000 a month. Do you get $13,000 a month from renting out your condo?\n\nNo? Start working on that karma.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Their responsibility includes explaining the product features and risks clearly and effectively to customers, and putting in place adequate safeguards to protect them.\n\n\"As part of MAS's supervision of FIs in Singapore, MAS may review FIs' sales practices for investment products,\" she added.\n\nThe supervisory care extends to foreign exchange (FX) trades executed by banks in Singapore, a bank source told BT. \"Document checks are required when we do RMB (renminbi) FX by using the onshore rate through the clearing bank as there is a requirement that the FX must be supported by merchandise trade,\" the source said.\n\nMAS also expects the banks to perform independent audits, and may seek evidence that proper processes are in place.\n\nThere is \"less concern\" when it comes to trade settlement in yuan, the source noted, as the receiving bank in mainland China is the one responsible for ensuring that the client is entitled to receive the payment from overseas.\n\nMAS said that the growth in RMB deposits reflects the growing trade and investment ties between China and the region. Demand has also been fuelled by the relaxation of the People's Bank of China's rules last year, allowing companies to channel surplus yuan liquidity offshore for centralised management.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We'll even throw in a free script, about a justice league of superhero crab and crayfish seeking vengeance for their kin against Singaporean buffet-goers gorging on the free-flow spread of cold shrimp, oysters, crab legs and crayfish in a frenzy not seen since the bad old days when Singaporean buffet behaviour was truly ugly.\n\nThere is a greater sense of civility now, but the sight of petite women carrying their body weight of shellfish on a plate is still one to behold. Food wastage police, you know where to head next. But at the same time, if you're looking for a really good value-for-money buffet, Amara's newly revamped all-day-dining concept offers a generous deal.\n\nBut we're not here to talk about the buffet. If you can tear your eyes away from the spread, you might notice a tall, young, floppy-haired Spanish chef in a separate kitchen tucked behind the cooking stations. That would be Mikel Badiola - newly transplanted from San Sebastian to serve up authentic pintxos for the newly launched bar that now occupies Element's street-facing entrance.\n\nHis authentic, home-style recipes are the highlight of an eclectic a la carte menu that, weirdly enough, includes options from the hotel's Thai and Chinese restaurants and familiar coffee-house staples. This something-for-everyone concept is a little jarring on the senses, especially when chef Badiola's cooking deserves much more than a second glance.\n\nFor one thing, it's the first time he is cooking outside of San Sebastian - in the Basque region of Spain which is home to multiple Michelin-starred eateries - so his food has yet to be influenced by Asian palates or trends. That means his croquetas ($9 for two) - the ubiquitous tapas that's so easy to find here but so hard to like - are perfect balls of deep-fried crumbed bliss that burst with a perfect creamy bechamel filling studded with bits of jamon that immediately revive memories of our first croqueta encounter at a Spanish friend's home.\n\nThat same unpretentious, homespun goodness leads to another welcome deja vu moment - the melting soft piquillo peppers ($12) stuffed with freshly made salt cod bechamel and swimming in a pool of addictive puree of paprika-scented char-grilled peppers. The sad hotel bread roll that comes with it diminishes our joy, but it's still put to good use to mop up every bit of sauce.\n\nFor a winning hattrick, order the Spanish tortilla ($10) - a fluffy, almost souffle-textured omelette with bite and substance from the chunky potatoes and rich scrambled egg.\n\nA bit of patience and an open mind are required to appreciate the Basque fish soup ($16) - a robust, briny fish broth reminiscent of Catalan suquet but here it's thickened with toast that's deliberately burnt.\n\nSo you get an immediate hint of charred bitterness upon first sip, but as you continue, you're rewarded with a nuanced sweetness as the base flavour of the fish broth comes through. Bits of shrimp, fish and clam also add to the flavour - but be warned, this is an either-you-like-it-or-you-don't option. But if you do, it's really good, especially with the hot buttered toast that comes with it.\n\nWe're less enthusiastic about the pulpo a la gallega ($15), mainly because the octopus is disappointingly chewy and tasteless despite being bathed in a fragrant oil that's used to cook the whole garlic cloves and potato cubes.\n\nThe same with the mussels cooked in white wine ($26) where the sweet mussels are overwhelmed by the alcohol that hasn't had a chance to burn off and add depth to the otherwise sweet clam broth. Also, the comforting braised pork cheek with mashed potatoes ($28) is undermined by the stringiness of the pork and a general mundaneness of preparation. The Basque tuna stew ($28) fares better with its saffron-scented briny sauce, tender potatoes and not-too-dry tuna chunks, but is let down by its over-saltiness.\n\nBut all are minor quibbles compared to the piece de resistance of chef Badiola's menu - roast suckling pig ($88 for half) that is almost to-die-for with its mix of fork-tender flesh and the wobbly, gelatinous cartilage and fat that envelopes the meat. The skin is commendably crisp if not shatteringly so, but the whole combination, with its richness cut through with the unlikely condiment of potent, garlicky Thai chilli dip, is mouth-watering. It's almost enough to overcome the pang of guilt at seeing how tiny the little piglet flown in from Spain is, compared to its scrappy Chinese cousins that are more common here. Chef Badiola also offers his own brown sauce which is itself tasty, but pales in comparison to the spicy Thai sauce.\n\nTo end off, the deconstructed cheesecake ($9) - a parfait-like concoction with cream cheese, cookie crumbs and berry compote is a winner, followed closely by a refreshing honey jelly ($9) topped with yogurt and rich walnut cream.\n\nThe greatest downside is that while Chef Badiola is technically supposed to cater to the bar \"element'\", you're really still eating in a hotel coffee house.

Instead, chartering rates fell by a third as orders for new ships more than doubled. Wilbur Ross, the billionaire known for turning around struggling industries from steel to textiles, pulled an initial public offering two weeks ago because he said that the price was too low.\n\nArdmore Shipping Corp, another owner of product tankers, sold shares earlier this month for less than the value of its fleet, according to Global Hunter Securities. Shares of Scorpio Tankers, the largest owner of the vessels, dropped 12 per cent this year, compared with a one per cent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of US equities.\n\n\"People are beginning to realise there's just too many product tankers,\" said Jeff McGee, the founder of Makai Marine Advisors in Dallas. \"Find a good sector with promising demand prospects and over-order. Nobody learned their lesson.\"\n\nInvestors expected product tankers to benefit from rising US and Middle East exports, said Mr McGee, who used to lead tanker research at Poten & Partners, a shipbroker. The US is shipping a record 3.7 million barrels a day of refined fuels, 16 per cent more than a year ago, the Energy Department says. Middle East refinery output will reach 8.7 million barrels a day by 2016, up from 7.8 million last year, Morgan Stanley says.\n\nProspects for rising demand spurred more ordering. Shipyards last year were booked to build 217 product tankers smaller than 60,000 deadweight tons, the size range of Ross's and Ardmore's fleets, according to data from Clarkson, the largest shipbroker. That's more than double the previous year and the most since 2006. Outstanding orders are equal to 20 per cent of the existing fleet, up from 16 per cent a year ago, the data show.\n\nRate gains haven't materialised, while the backlog of new vessels could create a glut. Rates for Medium-Range product tankers fell 32 per cent in the past year to US$10,732 a day, Clarkson data show. Last year's average of US$13,226 was the highest since 2008.\n\nSpot rates for the vessels fell this year as the coldest winter in the US since 1982 increased domestic fuel demand and the profit from shipping European petrol to the US diminished, said Fotis Giannakoulis, a New York-based analyst at Morgan Stanley. The fleet will expand by 5.1 per cent next year, the most since 2010, the bank estimates.\n\n\"Investors' expectations were significantly higher than reality, and a lot of the stocks were trading with overly optimistic expectations,\" Mr Giannakoulis said. As fleet growth accelerates, \"it's going to be very hard to see meaningful rate increases,\" he said.\n\nScorpio will benefit if investors' disappointment deters further ordering, said Robert Bugbee, the Monaco-based company's president. Scorpio's current fleet comprises 51 ships, with another 57 under construction, according to its website.\n\n\"That means less capital is available to the market for our competitors to overbuild,\" Mr Bugbee said. \"The long-term fundamentals remain intact on the product-tanker story.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and European Council President Herman Van Rompuy will also join the talks.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and US Secretary of State John Kerry will also meet separately to discuss the Ukraine crisis. Mr Lavrov is representing his country at the NSS in Mr Putin's absence.\n\nMr Obama, meanwhile, is due to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping here today as Washington seeks to build an international coalition and isolate Russia over its recent actions.\n\nBesides the Crimea issue, all eyes will also be on the outcome of a key trilateral summit involving Mr Obama, South Korean President Park Geun Hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nTies between Seoul and Tokyo are at their lowest ebb for years, compounded by issues such as an island territorial dispute and Japan's wartime use of so-called \"comfort women\". This will be the first formal meeting between Mr Abe and Ms Park since both took office a year ago.\n\nMany of the 53 world leaders, including Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, have arrived ahead of the summit's opening session later today.\n\nMr Lee's first order of business yesterday was a meeting with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte at his official residence the Catshuis. The two leaders said that they would like to deepen and expand cooperation in future.\n\nThe Netherlands is Singapore's second-largest investor in the European Union after the UK. There are more than a thousand Dutch companies with operations in Singapore, among them multinationals Philips and Shell.\n\nThis is the third time that Mr Lee is attending the NSS, after the inaugural event in Washington four years ago and the second one in Seoul in 2012. The summit, the brainchild of Mr Obama, aims to prevent nuclear materials falling into the hands of terrorists.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There are shops selling large, wobbling blocks of fresh tofu, bean sprouts and papayas. There are tiny stalls selling fish balls, pork, noodles or copy books to local schoolchildren. There are hardware stores, cheap clothing outlets and clattering car repair shops, whose shrines to the Chinese Earth God provide a colourful counterpoint to the oil-stained floors inside.\n\nMuch of this life, however, is in the process of disappearing, as a new architectural addition to Centre Street - an outdoor escalator that grinds up the street's steep incline under a modernist roof - takes its toll on the neighbourhood's commercial ecosystem.\n\nHong Kong is an exceedingly hilly city. The high-rises that house its residents and the offices that have turned the former British colony into an international financial hub are wedged between the sea and steep peaks. In days of yore, wealthy residents had themselves carried in sedan chairs when they wanted to travel to the higher reaches of the city. In 1888, a tram began trundling up and down the steep incline to Victoria Peak.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Property\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n4\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\n5\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/26358aedcf6731bff28acd89dfa79e23043cc1c369e2c233ad1e9b16789fe0b7?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Moving along: Within the past few months, High Street, which intersects Centre Street, has acquired an elegant French restaurant right by the new escalator."}]}

Then last year we bought the entire VLGC fleet of AP Moller Maersk, and we also embarked on a newbuilding programme for new ships.\"\n\nThe group had \"invested in aggregate over a billion dollars in the LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) space,\" Mr Sohmen-Pao shares matter-of-factly even as the group built up the world's largest LPG shipping group with a fleet of some 44 vessels, comprising 21 owned VLGCs, 10 chartered-in VLGCs, five owned LGCs and eight newbuildings with delivery from 2014 to 2015.\n\n\"We also see some significant projects in the pipeline, whether in increased exports or customers asking us to work with them on specific projects. So we felt that the combination of what we had committed and the projects coming through the pipeline made it sensible to be raising capital in the public markets,\" Mr Sohmen-Pao explained when asked why the group decided to list its LPG businesses in October last year.\n\nBW Group owns and operates a remarkably modern fleet of 110 offshore oil and gas-related vessels, ranging from VLGCs, LNG (liquefied natural gas) carriers to floating production storage and offloading (FPSOs) vessels and very large crude carriers (VLCCs).\n\nEven today, the process of evolution and rejuvenation continues, with industry observers now looking for the next potential listing of other group units, in particular its very sizeable LNG shipping segment.\n\nWhile still largely family owned, the group's astute and visionary leadership (chaired by Mr Sohmen-Pao's father Helmut Sohmen) has won it a strong investor following, as seen from the highly successful recent listing of BW's LPG shipping businesses through BW LPG Limited on the Oslo Stock exchange five months ago.\n\nSince then, the market capitalisation of the newly listed entity has risen significantly to 9.6 billion Norwegian kroner (S$2 billion), as BW LPG's stock price jumped from the listing price of 47 kroner per share to 70.5 kroner per share as at March 20. The group's other listed entity, BW Offshore, has a market capitalisation of five billion kroner. The two listed entities have a total value of 14.6 billion kroner.\n\nThe initial public offering (IPO) was well subscribed as institutional funds such as FMR LLC, Capital Group, Skagen AS, Allianz SE and Deutsche Bank jumped in for investment exposure to the rising importance of the shale oil and gas industry.\n\n\"Our mission is to apply our maritime expertise to find solutions to energy challenges,\" says Mr Sohmen-Pao. Strategically, the group intends first to keep building up its core shipping fleet to \"enable changing energy flows\"; second, to build out its floating marine infrastructure both in the oil and gas production space and floating gas space; and third, to invest in clean or green technologies to ensure that what they are doing is done in a sustainable way.\n\n\"It is with this in mind that we have built up the largest LPG fleet in the world, and the second largest FPSO or floating production company. We have a sizeable oil and LNG fleet and we have a team which is investing in promising technologies called Green Marine Capital.\"\n\nAs for BW LPG, the outlook remains bright. According to RS Platou, a 97 per cent fleet utilisation for VLGCs has meant that small movements in demand have affected rates substantially, with rates on some routes surpassing 2006 levels. Freight rates have been climbing on extra LPG cargoes on the export market. Estimates are that US annual LPG export capacity will nearly triple from 13 million tonnes this year to 33 million tonnes by end 2015, on a huge build-up of new terminals.\n\nFor the global investment community, the IPO of BW LPG seemed perfectly timed and placed. But the pathways to building and sustaining BW LPG prior to its much anticipated listing involved not just vision but a comprehensive and cohesive strategy and steely resolve.\n\nAfter all, this is no first-time listing for BW's gas carriers unit. After the Bergesen Worldwide group was formed in 2004 from the merger of two family-owned groups, Bergesen Group and World-Wide Shipping, it was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange under Bergesen Worldwide Gas ASA in 2005. But a decision by the Norwegian government to impose a punitive 10-year back tax on Norwegian shipping companies led to BW Gas being privatised and delisted in June 2009 as its shareholders safe harboured the company through a critical period of global financial turmoil.\n\n\"We are here for the long haul . . . and it's been a fascinating trip. When we bought the largest gas shipping company in the world, Bergesen, 10 years ago, everyone said we didn't need to worry about excess LPG supply as the US would take it at the right price. In the past five years, the shale gas revolution pushed imports down to zero and now LPG is coming out the other way as exports.\"\n\n\"We went through a very tough period when the US was neither importing nor exporting gas which was painful for gas shipping.\n\n\"We took it on the chin with the privatisation in 2009. We paid a 50 per cent premium to privatise the company but it was a challenging few years we had to carry following that.\"\n\nBacked by their inherent market experience and long-term view, the group patiently rode out the downturn. \"When we saw that there was life in the market, we started buying modern second hand tonnage and rebuilding the fleet. Concurrently, we did the IPO to ensure that we had the capital to keep on growing.\"\n\nAs for being in Singapore, he sees the country as an increasingly important maritime and trading hub for energy. As a sign of support for the country's push into the LNG space, two of BW's new LNG carriers to be delivered in 2015 will be flying the Singapore flag. With its 16 LNG ships, BW is also ranked as one of the world's largest independent owners of LNG carriers.\n\n\"It's good to aspire to a leadership position but I think it's important to define leadership in more ways than just having the largest number of ships. We work hard to meet customer needs and to provide a valuable service. It doesn't really matter what the rankings on the league table are, we are more motivated by doing things that have value and are sustainable.\"\n\nIndeed, based on the way the group has shaped its own destiny, as its chairman Helmut Sohmen had urged the shipping industry to do many years ago, the BW Group is now sitting well on board and ready for a great sail.\n\nlisalcc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Mar 21, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nMOST people study industrial design, go on to become an industrial designer - creating lamps, furniture . . . all the hard stuff. But not Nani Marquina. The industrial design graduate from the Escuela Massana of Barcelona found her niche as a rug designer. \"There was no demand for industrial designers in Spain when I had finished school in 1970,\" says Ms Marquina, who was in Singapore recently for the Maison&Objet Asia show.\n\n\"There were people who designed furniture, but no one was designing contemporary rugs,\" she goes on. Seeing a gap in the market, Ms Marquina says: \"I knew that if I wanted to design new rugs, I had to start my own company.\" Back then, contemporary rugs were unheard of in Spain.\n\nIn 1987, she founded her eponymous company. In Singapore, her rugs are available at Space at Bencoolen Street. Asked to describe her rug-making style, the 62-year-old says: \"My rugs try to connect with people through colours, sometimes texture, and volume. People connect with the rug the same way they do with a piece of art.\"\n\nThe nanimarquina mantra is \"we like to make people fall in love with our rugs. When people say they want this rug in their home now, this is when we know that we have succeeded\", says Ms Marquina.\n\nBut while a well-designed furniture or product can be easily defined, a well-designed rug may seem harder to appreciate. But Ms Marquina says simply: \"A rug that looks good, that looks like a piece of art, that is a well-designed piece\".\n\nMs Marquina designs some of the rugs herself, but she also works with fellow designers. They include well-known names such as Tord Boontje, Ron Arad, Marti Guixe and Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec. \"I work with designers that have similar thoughts as me - designers who respect craftsmanship and who are interested in transforming the world of rugs,\" says Ms Marquina. No brief is given to the designers, who instead come back to her with proposals.\n\nOne of the key pieces in the collection is Losanges by the French Bouroullec brothers. The technically complex piece is handmade using the ancient kilim technique and requires great skill as it involves combining 13 colours through the geometrical rhombus shape.\n\nAnother new piece in the collection is Ghost by Spanish designer Guixe. His black and white Ghost rug recreates the mythical pictorial motifs of birds, flowers, horses and deer that appear and disappear like ghosts. ninamarquina rugs are made from wool, jute, nettle, silk, recycled polyester and even recycled rubber from the inner tubes of bicycle tyres. \"I wanted to use a new material that wasn't used before, so I thought about latex,\" says Ms Marquina. The tubes are cut into strips and used like threads to form the Bicicleta rug.\n\nFrom a factory in Spain, she decided to move her production to India, Pakistan and Morocco. \"We could only produce machine-made rugs in Spain, which was rather limited,\" she explains.\n\nAt the new production locations, the rugs are all made using traditional methods, such as the hand tufted, hand knotted, hand loomed and kilim techniques, by local craftsmen. \"As everything is handmade, there is no limitation to the thread thickness, shape, and colours when producing a rug,\" says Ms Marquina.\n\nYou would think that with a handmade product, each piece will be different, but Ms Marquina shakes her head. \"No, no, all the pieces must look the same. And they must look exactly like they do in the catalogue. That is the real challenge for the craftsmen,\" she says. She adds that she has a small loom at home to make samples.\n\nMoving her production out of Spain, she adds, fulfils her wish to boost local economies in these countries and offers new opportunities and improved living standards for local people. nanimarquina also works with Care&Fair, an organisation that combats child labour and works towards improving the living conditions of the people who work in rug manufacturing in India, Pakistan and Nepal. nanimarquina makes voluntary contributions to Care&Fair by earmarking a percentage of the value of the rugs they import, thus funding schools, training, hospitals and healthcare programmes developed by Care&Fair in the above mentioned countries.\n\nWhile Ms Marquina heads the design team, her family is very much involved in the business. Her daughter, Maria Piera, is her right-hand woman in managing the business, son-in-law Pierre Armengaud deals with global sales, and her sister Carlota is the company's art director.\n\nMs Marquina says it is both \"satisfying but difficult\" to have family work with her. \"My daughter studied economics, so making money matters to her,\" she says. \"I, on the other hand, want to make good looking products. So we both have different visions, but we can still produce results.\"\n\nShe lets on that she has about seven rugs at home. \"Rugs define a space,\" she says. \"I like to think of them as a 'tray' under furniture, where they give more importance to it.\"\n\nWhile she has found success by going into a niche market, Ms Marquina believes she could be just as successful had she become an industrial designer. \"If I had chosen to design some other product, such as a sofa, or a light, I would still be successful as a rug designer, as I put in the same interest in all my projects.\"\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

While inflation is muted, analysts expect the Fed to wind down its bond buying before the end of this year and to start raising interest rates some time next year.\n\nAnalysts at brokerage Morgan Stanley advocated clients \"stay the course\" with US equities. Part of the reason that US stocks look relatively good is that alternatives look so bad, the Morgan Stanley analysts argued. There are \"incipient\" signs of deflation in the eurozone, and many emerging markets - from China to Ukraine to Venezuela are in full-fledged crisis mode. For now, the Morgan Stanley analysts said, the regional difficulties are not spilling into the US.\n\nThe root of the problem was a sudden rise in emerging market government borrowing rates, which itself was a ripple effect of the rise in US Treasury rates. In an interconnected world, the likelihood of another shock from China or Argentina depends, in part, on the behaviour of Treasuries. Barring such a shock, however, the 2014 outlook is relatively bright, according to Morgan Stanley and others.\n\n\"The global expansion remains on track, with muted inflationary pressures across developed market economies allowing central bank accommodation to remain ample,\" the Morgan Stanley analysts said.\n\nThe broad Standard & Poor's 500 index has bounced around for most of the opening to 2014, but one brokerage predicts that it will finish the year with a gain of more than 13 per cent, \"winding\" its way up from its current level of 1,866 to 2,100.\n\n\"Despite rising geopolitical uncertainty, we believe this bull market remains intact,\" said analysts at Piper Jaffray, in a note to clients. \"We continue to characterise 2014 as a good, but not great year like 2013.\"\n\nAn uneasy peace seems to have settled on Ukraine, as Ukrainian troops conceded the territory of Crimea to Russia. Unrest continues in Eastern Ukrainian cities such as Donetsk, where Mr Putin could invoke his stated right to defend ethnic Russians. With clashes between pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian rallies in those cities dying down in recent days, however, an imminent invasion seems unlikely.\n\nThe US stock market has a notoriously short attention span, and another week of peace could drive Ukraine out of traders' minds altogether.\n\n\"All's quiet on the (Ukrainian) front at the moment, but that doesn't seem like a situation where it's going to be 'Oh, OK, it's all over',\" said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade. \"To me the Ukraine situation is a bit like the European situation was a year and a half ago . . . you may not hear anything for while, then all of a sudden, in a month, you get a little news, and everyone panics.\"\n\nOne sign that the Crimean takeover was not the end of the crisis is the Russian troop movements on the Ukrainian border, near Donetsk. US National Security Adviser Susan Rice said she is concerned about the troop build-up and sceptical of Russian claims that it's part of training exercises.\n\n\"It's a little early to speculate on what Mr Putin's intentions are . . . we have to see if his actions match his words,\" Mr Kinahan said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The tanker was due to arrive later at Libya's Zawiya port, where its cargo of crude will be fed into the Zawiya refinery.\n\nIt was a rare victory for Tripoli, which is struggling to end a port blockade by rebels, one of many challenges facing the weak central government which has failed to secure the North African country three years after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nFormer anti-Gaddafi rebels and militias refuse to surrender their weapons and often use force or control of oil facilities to make demands on a state whose army is still in training with Western governments.\n\nThe crew of the Morning Glory, which was North Korean-flagged until Pyongyang disavowed the vessel, say armed Libyan rebels boarded the ship, forced them to load crude and to evade the Libyan navy sent to stop them.\n\nEastern federalist leader Ibrahim Jathran, whose fighters seized the three ports last summer, is demanding a greater share in Libya's oil resources and more autonomy for his region where many feel they have been abandoned by Tripoli for years.\n\nThe Tripoli government gave Mr Jathran a two-week deadline on March 12 to end his port blockade or face a military assault, though analysts say Libya's nascent armed forces may struggle to carry out that threat.\n\nWestern governments, which backed Nato's air strikes to help the 2011 anti-Gaddafi revolt, are training Libya's armed forces and are pressing the factions to reach a political settlement. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/d5c60796f09163bf3c8624b2e92cf506f2dcb777713287b7d2781ee911795cf0?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Morning Glory: US forces seized the tanker days after it left the rebel-held Es Sider port.

For example, in order to have a level playing field for Singapore banks, additional Tier-1 instruments are now treated as debt, and hence tax deductible for issuers.\"\n\nStill, there are challenges that emerge. \"Our view is that if every bank across the region adopts Basel III standards in operating their businesses, Singapore banks will be able to compete on a more level playing field,\" said Mr Lee. \"However, the reality is that not every bank in the region factors in liquidity and duration risks when pricing their loan spreads and this creates an irrational level of pricing that Basel III compliant banks have to compete against.\"\n\nBroadly, regulations also bring higher cost in data management. Banks must now process high volumes of data - which include complicated over-the-counter (OTC) derivative exposures - to meet reporting requirements. \"Banks still have a long way to go, with the sheer volumes they have to process,\" said Mr Stewart, adding that data was previously cut into different silos, and must now be consolidated.\n\n\"Regulators are looking under the hood\" to make sure that OTC derivative trades are booked correctly, he said. This also comes against a drive by regulators to put OTC trades on exchanges to boost transparency.\n\nSetting up a new system can cost millions, he added.\n\nMr Tan said that challenges come from calculating net outflows from derivative trades, and customer flows for the entire banking group, and on a daily basis. \"We have been working to enhance our existing data management and reporting capabilities.\"\n\nThe bank is in regular dialogue with the regulators, to ensure that the industry can meet the intent of the Basel III regulations and manage the cost of implementing them, he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Closer to home, there was negative news affecting Johor property play Albedo Investment that dampened sentiment in penny stocks and large movements in the Jardine group - particularly Jardine Cycle & Carriage (JC&C) - that caused heightened volatility in the Straits Times Index (STI).\n\nAt the end of the five days the index stood almost flat, registering a 0.33 point loss to 3,073.39, yesterday's 16.19-point rise coming largely because of gains in Jardine Matheson, JC&C and the banks. Volume in yesterday's session was, however, a poor 1.6 billion units worth $1.2 billion. The lowest volume came on Tuesday, when $944 million was done.\n\nMidweek, investors had to deal with news that China's Zhejiang Xingrun Real Estate Co, which is based in the coastal city of Ningbo in Zhejiang province, may be on the verge of bankruptcy. Reuters reported that state media had estimated the company owes 15 domestic banks 2.4 billion yuan (S$493.4 million) and individual investors another 1.1 billion yuan, with only three billion yuan of assets on hand.\n\nThis came a week after a bond default by Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co that has led to fears over the country's shadow banking industry.\n\nMarkets were also rocked on Thursday after the US FOMC meeting, not because a third US$10 billion cut in monetary stimulus was announced but because of language the Federal Reserve used that hinted at sooner-than-expected interest rate hikes.\n\nThere was turmoil in the penny segment on Wednesday when a Malaysian newspaper reported that a plan to inject key property assets in Iskandar, Johor, into Albedo had been called off. Albedo, one of the local market's penny segment leaders this year, lost 2.2 cents to three cents in high volume that day before the company was queried by the Singapore Exchange.\n\nOne minute later, the company called for trading halt in its shares and later released a statement saying the news report was inaccurate and that negotiations were still ongoing. Trading has not resumed yet.\n\nBrokers said the selling of Albedo led to spillover selling of others in the penny sector. Among the other penny counters in focus during the week were China water treatment play HanKore Ltd, CCM Group and offshore marine firm Charisma Energy.\n\nAmong blue chips, JC&C stood out with its large daily movements. On Tuesday, the company received an SGX query for reasons for the large price rise and replied that it could have been because of various developments relating to Indonesia, including a rise in the rupiah and upcoming elections. A Trade With Caution was then issued on its shares.\n\nAs for interest rate worries, DBS yesterday noted that Wall Street rose on Thursday and the VIX Index, which measures expected volatility, did not rise by much. \"This this is in line with our reading that Fed tapering has been priced into the market but it is expectations of the timing and magnitude of rate increases that affect US Treasury yields,\" said DBS.\n\nIdeaglobal said in its daily notes that the end game for the Fed is \"tightening is coming\", with chairman Janet Yellen dropping hints that the first rate hike will be in summer 2015. \"Strategic players thus need to ask the question of what is the eventual equilibrium Fed Funds rate, plus the pace of tightening in 2015 and 2016,\" said Ideaglobal.\n\n\"The Fed's new qualitative guidance is not enough to anchor market expectations, and strong data could bring forward expectations of the first hike from autumn 2015 towards late spring. More importantly, the market could really believe that the Fed will hike next year.

The four-star property has 186 rooms and sits on freehold land area of about 6,722 square metres (sq m) with an approximate gross floor area of about 11,441 sq m.\n\nSpecifically, Hotel Royal's subsidiary Hotel Royal Thailand (HRT) has entered into a sale-and-purchase agreement with Sunyata Heritage Company while HRT's subsidiary, Excellent Hotel (Thailand) Company Limited (EHT), has entered into a sale-and-purchase agreement with five individuals and RLP Company Limited.\n\nHRT and EHT will acquire the entire issued and paid-up share capital of Panali in the proportion of 49 per cent and 51 per cent, respectively.\n\nAccording to Hotel Royal, the acquisition is an opportunity for the group to expand its hotel operations in the region.\n\n\"Based on the consideration of 1.3 billion baht for the resort, the cost per guest room of about 7.0 million baht is reasonable. The resort is also valued at 1.35 billion baht, which is slightly higher than the consideration of 1.3 billion baht,\" said the company.\n\nThe group also owns Hotel Royal Bangkok @ Chinatown, a 315-room hotel in the Thai capital. The acquisition is expected to add synergy to the group's hotel operations in Thailand in terms of sales referrals, joint marketing and management time.\n\nThe acquisition will be financed by internal funds and bank borrowings. The completion date is June 30.\n\nHotel Royal shares ended eight cents higher at $3.50 in trading yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/bitcoin-virtual-currency-real-world-problems", "site_title": "Bitcoin: virtual currency, real-world problems", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nBitcoin: virtual currency, real-world problems\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Mar 21, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nAS we think about bitcoin (a splendid way to pass a weekend), a chance to quote The Good Wife presents itself: \"Reality isn't idealistic. And when the two of them run into each other, only one of them gets hurt.\"\n\nNow, as bitcoin runs up against the confines of the real world, the question of which side will yield more is worth considering. It is a complex one.\n\nBitcoin operators worldwide run the gamut from the suit-clad to the Bermuda-wearing - a metaphor for how the players also range from the respectable to the dodgy. (This is a problematic metaphor, as the largest crimes in history have been committed by men in suits.)\n\nIn Singapore, bitcoin outfits have veered towards the legitimate. The people behind them include ex-bankers, entrepreneurs with track records and at least one chap sensible enough to hang on to his day job.\n\nSince bitcoin took off in earnest here last year, many operators have inundated the authorities with earnest questions, like how to account for the goods and services tax and whether or not to verify customer identities - hardly the stuff of AK-47s and methamphetamine.\n\nSo, the community appears willing to play ball. The larger question - for Singapore and everywhere else - is whether bitcoin firms will be allowed to play at all.\n\nNow, the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) plan to regulate bitcoin operators in the money laundering and terrorist financing areas are being celebrated by some in the community.\n\nThis is the first step towards legitimacy for bitcoin operations, goes the reasoning by what must be the most glass-half-full type of people in the space-time continuum. Others who tend to notice the missing half of a glass's contents must surely wonder if these rules portend further regulation that might be more onerous.\n\nIt is not an unfounded fear. Last December, China's largest bitcoin exchange, BTC China, saw its fortunes rocket up and down with the Chinese government's stance on bitcoins, when initial regulation looked likely to cripple the exchange's ability to accept deposits in yuan. By January, however, the dust had settled and the exchange was accepting yuan deposits through bank transfers.\n\nWhat these events underscore is just how closely the bitcoin ecosystem is tied to that of the financial establishment. Sometimes, that tenuous connection snaps. Last year, several Canadian bitcoin outfits found their bank accounts either frozen or shut down, and no reason was given.\n\nIt probably did not help that bitcoin is touted as an alternative currency that can circumvent unwieldy banks without interference from a party-pooping central authority. Money can be transferred across the world in seconds, for a micro-fraction of the transaction fees that banks and other payment processors charge.\n\nWhat on earth would compel a bank to provide a service to an industry that threatens its revenue from telegraphic transfers and foreign exchange spreads?\n\nBut as the community reaches for legitimacy, it is in the untenable position of seeking cooperation from these unwieldy banks and party-pooping central authorities. This is the equivalent of a solar energy firm relying on the goodwill of an oil company.\n\nFor some, the argument is that these are merely teething problems, and bitcoin will eventually become another US dollar or euro, as newcomers and established players adjust their business models in deference to the new and better ideas that must certainly win out.\n\nThat is a reasonable expectation, except that it is not a unanimous one. Some adopters of bitcoin elsewhere are drawn to it for its anarchist overtones, its almost-anonymous qualities and its law-bending potential. They are surely at odds with those who want to use bitcoin as a frictionless form of payment for inoffensive garden furniture on Overstock.com.\n\nOf course, fiat currencies remain the mainstay of money laundering, and al-Qaeda is unlikely to transact in bitcoin for now. But it is bitcoin that carries the headline-making miasma of the unsavoury. The drug wonderland that was Silk Road and high-profile arrest of a bitcoin entrepreneur in New York on money laundering charges do little for its reputation.\n\nGiven all these factors, the probability that MAS is thrilled about Singapore being portrayed as bitcoin-friendly with welcoming tax laws and a lack of regulation is somewhere between zero and nil.\n\nSo far, it has been careful to define the boundaries of its involvement - it will not meddle in consumer and investor decisions for bitcoin. Only the most naive will believe that this stance is set in stone. In fact, one suspects that the primary reason for the absence of wider intervention is bitcoin's own lack of wider adoption.\n\nThe collision between bitcoin and the real world of regulation and Big Business is a given. Before it happens, the cryptocurrency community had better decide between wearing suits or Bermudas, and put on a helmet for good measure.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Based on Hutchison's most recent set of results out in February, analysts have valued AS Watson at between US$22.3 billion (Nomura) and US$34.4 billion (Morgan Stanley).\n\nTaking the average of valuations done by 11 analysts yields a figure of US$26.8 billion - which equates to a value of US$6.6 billion for a 24.95 per cent stake, or about US$1 billion more than what Temasek is paying. Hutchison's group managing director Canning Fok also said recently that, based on the group's own collation of data, the average valuation estimate for AS Watson from analysts is HK$195 billion (US$25.1 billion), which would translate to US$6.26 billion for a 24.95 per cent stake.\n\nThese valuations exclude AS Watson's Marionnaud business - the largest perfumeries & cosmetics retailer in Europe; Hutchison had indicated Marionnaud would be excluded from any share sale of AS Watson, as it is undergoing a refurbishment programme.\n\nWhen asked, Temasek confirmed that its purchase of a 24.95 per cent stake in AS Watson excludes the Marionnaud business. It does, however, include AS Watson's other well-known brands, such as Hong Kong's top supermarket brand ParknShop, its top electronics retailer Fortress, and one of the United Kingdom's leading health & beauty retailers, Superdrug.\n\nAS Watson has more than 10,500 stores, operating 14 retail brands, in 25 markets around the world. Its Watsons brand alone operates over 4,000 stores and more than 900 pharmacies in nine Asian markets.\n\nIt explains why AS Watson's anticipated public listing was expected to be the world's largest since AIA Group's US$20.4 billion offering in 2010. Rumours were floated as early as October last year that Hutchison was considering selling shares in AS Watson, in an initial public offering (IPO) worth some HK$98 billion.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, Mr Li himself said Hutchison hoped to spin off AS Watson for a listing in Hong Kong and an overseas market this year, after reporting better-than-expected earnings for last year.\n\nThe Financial Times, quoting two people familiar with the deal, reported yesterday that Temasek's acquisition of the quarter stake in AS Watson \"scuppers . . . plans by Asian tycoon Li Ka-shing to list his AS Watson health and beauty chain\". One of its sources said Hutchison roped in Temasek as a strategic investor as it was feeling \"jittery about an IPO\".\n\nHowever, when asked by The Business Times if this deal would affect AS Watson's listing plans, Temasek said: \"Hutchison and Temasek have agreed to work together towards listing AS Watson at a suitable time.\"\n\nIt is believed that there is still scope for a dual listing, with the second market likely being Singapore, given Temasek's interest.\n\nHutchison's announcement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange yesterday also confirmed that such listing plans are still on the cards. It also said that the \"strategic alliance\" with Temasek would maximise the value of AS Watson.\n\n\"The transaction will allow the group to partially unlock the value of its AS Watson group of businesses and set an important valuation benchmark for the group's remaining interests,\" it said.\n\nTemasek's head of Investment Group, Chia Song Hwee, said Temasek shares AS Watson's \"philosophy to invest and build businesses for the long term, especially in Asia\".\n\n\"AS Watson is a well-established company with a proven management team, a valuable franchise and a good growth story. The consumer retail sector is a good proxy to growing middle income populations and transforming economies. This is very much part of our investment themes as we shape Temasek's portfolio for the long term,\" he said.\n\nIn the consumer retail space, Temasek has a 3 per cent stake - valued at HK$89 million as at March 31, 2013 - in Li & Fung, Hong Kong's multinational consumer goods group.\n\n\"We continue to believe in the growth opportunities and long-term prospects of Asia, particularly China, and a recovering Europe,\" Mr Chia added.\n\nAS Watson's audited net assets value attributable to its shareholders was HK$9.2 billion, as at Dec 29, 2013, according to Hutchison's filing. Its audited net profit after tax and extraordinary items for FY2012 and FY2013 were HK$6.9 billion and HK$7.8 billion, respectively.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Jaime Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Mar 21, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nUNLIKE other sommeliers, Yuichi Sato doesn't play with pretty decanters, sniff and swirl, or expound on the differing qualities of red and white. Instead, he sifts through the contents of giant paper sacks, points out the minor differences between brown and white, and tells you that empty 1.5 litre PET bottles are his storage receptacles of choice.\n\nMr Sato, 32, is a rice sommelier - an unusual occupation anywhere else but certainly not in a country obsessed with the quality of just about everything, particularly this shiny, chewy staple that forms the soul of Japanese cooking. Sommeliers like him are taught to differentiate between different grades of rice, as well as the growing methods and history. There are probably about 1,000 accredited rice sommeliers in Japan, but Mr Sato is the only one in Singapore. The former banker gave up his cushy career back home two years ago to pursue his passion and create a niche he knew he could fill in Japanese food-obsessed Singapore - a demand for premium quality rice.\n\nWhen he started Tawaraya as an online Japanese rice delivery service, the main sources in Singapore were supermarkets such as Meidi-ya and Isetan. While it was tough going at first (especially with the high yen at the time), he now has a steady clientele of around 75 restaurants and 1,500 online customers who have switched to his personally-chosen artisanal rice that he sources from farms in Niigata and Hokkaido.\n\nWorking from his no-frills office/factory in Pandan Avenue which he leases from a Japanese logistics company, Mr Sato brings in 16 tonnes of rice every two months which is polished to order to ensure freshness - a key factor that sets Tawaraya apart from the pre-packaged rice available commercially.\n\nLike any perishable produce, rice tastes best at its freshest, which is immediately after the brown kernels are polished down to their pristine shiny white state. The best time to buy and consume rice is within a month of polishing, says Mr Sato, but if it's not possible, it should be kept in the fridge in plastic PET bottles for easy keeping. Commercial rice is already polished before it's packed for export, so it's impossible to know how old the rice that you buy off the shelf is.\n\nHalf of Japan's rice is grown in Niigata prefecture - home of the famed Hoshihikari, although quality varies depending on the source. \"Rice in Niigata tastes good and is easy to grow,\" says Mr Sato about Hoshihikari's popularity. \"But now, Hokkaido rice is catching up. Before, it was difficult to grow rice there because of the cold temperature, but they have developed strains that can withstand the weather and the quality is becoming very good.\"\n\nMr Sato's experience with rice comes naturally - he was born in Niigata and his grandfather was a rice farmer although the family has since given up the trade because of immense competition. Now, he makes regular trips to farms, sussing out the quality of the grain and the farming practices before he decides what he wants to import into Singapore. He picks farms that use the least amount of chemicals as well as those that use no chemicals at all, he says. \"But unless you are eating brown rice, buying organic does not make a big difference once the rice is polished because you've already gotten rid of the outer layer.\" However, farmers which use minimal chemicals or are completely organic also take more care with their crop, which means better tasting rice.\n\nQuality\n\nWhat kind of rice you buy depends on personal preference, he adds, but the best indication of quality is that the rice still tastes soft and chewy even when it's cold. \"That's how the onigiri culture came about - that is, the popular rice balls that the Japanese eat all the time.\" He grades his rice according to taste, smell and stickiness, with Hokkaido Nanatsuboshi being less sticky and more sushi-like, while softer rice that's best eaten on its own would be Hokkaido Yumepirika. The gold standard, of course, would be Niigata Hoshikihari which is a perfect balance between the two. Mr Sato gets his rice from Uonuma in south Niigata which he says grows the best quality rice. He's just started to bring in rice from south Uonuma, which he says is even better quality, but of course at a premium price. A 2kg bag of south Uonuma rice goes for $31, 50 per cent more than a similar sized bag of Hokkaido Nanatsuboshi.\n\nConsidering that a 10kg bag of Royal Umbrella Thai rice weighs in at around $30, Japanese rice is no everyday meal, but it certainly hasn't put the brakes on Mr Sato's endeavour to bring the best of his homeland to Singapore. It's one reason why he quit banking he says. There's so much premium produce in Japan that doesn't leave the country, but his passion is such that \"it's good to share, so more people can appreciate it,\" he says.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Put on by Wild Rice Theatre, the issues presented in The House were in turn dramatised to the hilt for that hyper-realism factor.\n\nDirected by Glen Goei, every component of the production was carefully and aesthetically staged for the whole packaged experience. From the costumes to lighting and stage design, and the chorus and their choreographed movements, not to mention the strong female cast - the whole production swept one up with its \"stage noir\" feel.\n\nBut perhaps it was just a tad too orchestrated. Because although the attention to detail wowed, this reviewer didn't stay as engaged in the story as expected. After a while, the drama and the histrionics of the actors hit a saturation point.\n\nThe beauty of Lorca's play is certainly its universality and relevance to similar societies he was critiquing, and US-based Singapore-born Chay Yew's script also brought home the play, so to speak.\n\nThe House of Bernarda Alba's subtitle, one should be reminded, is \"A Drama of Women in the Villages of Spain\", and the story unfolds with the funeral of Bernarda Alba's husband, and two house maids (played by Jo Kukathas and Sharda Harrison) spit out their hatred of the matriarch who is anal retentive about cleanliness, tyranically pious, and supremely concerned about keeping up appearances.\n\nBernarda (played by Claire Wong) then imposes an eight-year period of mourning upon her daughters and they're not to leave the house of her father and grandfather because that's \"the way\" it was and shall be. Bernarda is intent upon customs and appearances, while the daughters each display suppressed quirks and repressed behaviour.\n\nAfter the funeral, the next event is eldest daughter Angustias's (Neo Swee Lin) marriage, to a suitor who only wants her inheritance. Soon, it's discovered that another sister Martirio (Noorlinah Mohamed) is secretly in love with her sister's suitor, while he is in fact tangling with the youngest sister Adela (Glory Ngim). Magdalena (Karen Tan) is perhaps the most realistic about the sense of limitations and the role of the female, while Amelia's (Serene Chen) sexually repressed mind is also the most fertile.\n\nWith such a cast of veteran female actors, perhaps the oddest casting was Neo Swee Lin as the eldest daughter against Claire Wong as the matriarch. Neo was suitably restrained in her role however, and came across as the meek first daughter (of another father). Wong on the other hand looked to be acting the hardest in her role as a hard, domineering matriarch. Noorlinah Mohamed was the sister who had to flit between emotions the most - from jealousy to a bitter hatred by her wish to deny her sisters their suitor if she can't have him.\n\nAs the youngest, most tempestuous and least repressed sister, Glory Ngim played a convincing young girl, even when she seemed to be doing more \"pronouncements\" and proclamations and seemed more detached, both in the role and as an actor from the more senior actors. A bit of comic relief, though arguably out of tonal sync with the play, was ably provided by Sharon Lim as a friend who comes to visit the family.\n\nAn audience poll might reveal unanimous accolades for Jo Kukathas and Margaret Chan - both who excelled in their roles respectively as a know-it-all maid with a handle on every single family character, behaving more like a normal mother to the girls, and as the demented grandmother who acts as the voice of oracle. The greek style chorus - envisioned by Chay Yew in his playwrighting of the Spanish play - was impeccably choreographed.\n\nThe House of Bernarda Alba sucks one into a maelstrom of emotions but it's hard to remain immersed in that kind of heightened drama, when the characters aren't real but mere vehicles of messages. One can't fault the team at Wild Rice however for giving us, again, a theatrically dramatic night out.\n\nuihoon@sph.com.sg\n\nThe House of Bernarda Alba plays until Mar 29 at the Drama Centre Theatre.

It is also adjusted for factors such as size, location, amenities, floor level and the direction where the unit is facing.\n\n\"It is not an appraisal, but aims to provide a standard for pricing homes and assisting pre-valuation financing decisions,\" SRX said yesterday.\n\nSRX chief executive and co-founder Sam Baker told reporters that X-Value can \"mitigate the problems faced by HDB home buyers\", following recent changes in the HDB resale rules that require buyers to first obtain the option to purchase (OTP) from the sellers before they can seek HDB valuation for the units.\n\nWhile the new rule is aimed at getting buyers and sellers to focus on market prices rather than cash-over-valuation (COV), both buyers and sellers are treading with caution now that they can no longer use the HDB valuation report as the starting point or benchmark for pricing a unit. This is unlike in private home transactions where buyers can get an indicative valuation from banks before entering into an OTP.\n\nProperty agents note that buyers have been concerned that they would have to botch their deals and forfeit the downpayment if they have to fork out a large cash outlay due to a huge discrepancy between the agreed price and the subsequent HDB valuation.\n\n\"Sellers feel more at ease knowing there's a good estimate of their value and can make informed decisions when pricing their properties,\" said Thomas Tan, executive director of RE/MAX Singapore.\n\nPropNex key executive officer Lim Yong Hock described the X-Value as a \"saving grace\" for buyers and sellers in the HDB resale market and noted that SRX has the benefit of being plugged into data on both caveat and non-caveat transactions.\n\nMr Baker said that the timing of the launch was coincidental with the recent HDB rules given that the project was started one year ago with funding from the government through the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA). \"There is no reason why property prices should not have the same level of clarity as that of stock prices,\" he said.\n\nSome websites such as Property Guru and Baize Technology have tried to provide a similar service. But Property Guru provides only valuation estimates for private residential properties while Baize Technology - founded by a software engineer with its core business in software development - does not generate an estimated price for units where there are no recent comparable transactions.\n\nRichard Tan, founder of Baize Technology, told BT that his website generates an estimated price based on \"a certain algorithm that is widely accepted by the industry\" and offers free property reports.\n\nJeremy Lee, co-founder and chief technology officer of SRX, explained that X-Value is derived using a multivariate method that can isolate and adjust for individual factors. Where there are no relevant recent transactions, the X-Value can still be generated by factoring in the price indices of SRX and URA to make adjustments for older transacted prices.\n\nIt boils down to the \"robustness of the system\", said Mr Lee. \"The question is how to make sure you generate a consistently good number for each transaction.\"\n\nThe project team for X-Value includes real estate agencies, consultants from academic institutions, government agencies as well as A*Star's Institute for Infocomm Research and StreetSine, the technology provider for SRX. Comparable transactions and factors used in the X-Value of a home are listed in a summary report, which is available to agents registered with SRX.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Just one commodity derivative - OTC FFA (Forward Freight Agreement) - saw a decline in volumes.\n\nThe largest growth - in absolute terms - was OTC Iron Ore which grew from 219,319 lots to 584,157 lots. In percentage terms, OTC Rubber climbed the fastest, with a 278 per cent jump to 2,778 lots. Rubber Futures grew 35 per cent to 346,267 lots in 2013, with the continued pickup this year resulting in a recent record in daily volume of 4,275 lots on March 11.\n\nThe report is not surprising as derivative clearing fees have been doing well year on year, according to analyst Kenneth Ng of CIMB. \"However, the contribution of commodity products is relatively low compared to its index futures products,\" he said.\n\nHe added that it will take some time for derivative clearing fees to add weight to overall revenues and that the exchange needs to continue ensuring more participants come onboard to trade their products on SGX.\n\nGlobally, commodity derivatives trading grew 23 per cent in 2013 to four billion contracts from 3.24 billion a year earlier, according to the World Federation of Exchanges.\n\nVolumes were boosted by transfers of cleared over-the-counter energy swaps to futures by the InterContinental Exchange and the \"continuing sharp increase\" in volume at exchanges in mainland China, according to the report.\n\nThe United States and mainland China accounted for 79 per cent of the global volumes in 2013.\n\nTo ride on this wave, SGX has made several partnerships in China to beef up its commodities derivatives business - earlier this month, it teamed up with Dalian Commodity Exchange and in October, it inked a memorandum of understanding with the Shanghai Futures Exchange to develop a commodity derivatives market in China and Singapore.\n\nSGX closed trading yesterday at $6.68, down three cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Divided into every imaginable sub-genre with literally something for everyone - children, adults, and even women - the scene not only has a fervent following domestically but is also regularly exported overseas.\n\nSome like Studio Ghibli, have gained a steady cult following outside Japan over the years, and its latest work, The Wind Rises, has gone as far as to earn Best Foreign Film and Best Animated Film nominations at the Golden Globe and Oscars respectively this year.\n\nThe animated historical drama was Japan's top grossing movie of 2013, earning \u00a511.6 billion (S$140 million) at the box office. It opened in Singapore yesterday and is written and directed by one of Ghibli's co-founders, Hayao Miyazaki - who's also behind many of the studio's hit films including its signature movie My Neighbour Totoro (1988), Princess Mononoke (1997) and Spirited Away (2001).\n\nDespite The Wind Rises' critical acclaim and box-office success, the film also courted controversy overseas because the protagonist is an aircraft engineer who designed planes that were used for World War II. Geoffrey Wexler, chief of Studio Ghibli's International Division, however defends the film by pointing out the criticisms were raised mostly by those who have not watched the film.\n\n\"The hardest thing for me is people commenting on the film before they've even seen it... it's an easy topic to create a controversy out of but the people who have seen the film don't talk about that; they talk about other things like the love story in it,\" says Mr Wexler, who was in town earlier this week.\n\nMr Miyazaki was not spared by the home crowd either with some Japanese labelling The Wind Rises' anti-war message as anti-Japanese and accused him of being a traitor.\n\nMr Wexler adds that Mr Miyazaki's fascination with aviation in fact can be traced back to his father who worked in the industry and the flying theme is a recurring one that can be seen in his films Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of Wind (1984) and Porco Rosso (1992).\n\nAs Studio Ghibli's popularity spreads overseas, some purists have also cried foul over dubbed and reworked versions of its films that are made for the overseas markets. Hence, the studio has a strict no-edits policy after Nausica\u00e4 was heavily sliced and diced to become a kid-friendly cartoon for the American market during its early days. It also famously reinforced that practice when Miramax tried to tinker with Princess Mononoke but was gently reminded with a note - accompanied by a samurai sword - that simply read \"no cuts\".\n\nA lot of care is now taken when dubbing is involved so the film's integrity is kept, according to Mr Wexler.\n\nThe English version of The Wind Rises, which opened in North America last month, features a new voice cast comprising Hollywood heavyweights such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Emily Blunt and William H Macy but Mr Wexler, who is also its producer, says that's the only difference because his job is to ensure the original director's vision is presented intact, regardless of the language of the film.\n\nHowever, he notes dubbing can have its advantages - \"It gives children a chance to come and watch a film even if they can't read. And for older audiences, it gives them a chance to (enjoy) the film instead of reading the subtitles.\"\n\nThe Wind Rises (in Japanese with English and Chinese subtitles) is in cinemas now\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Currently in style is Burgundy, almost ad nauseam! Demand appears to be insatiable at the moment, coming from all quarters, notably from mainland China. Names bandied around are the likes of Romanee Conti, La Tache, and Montrachet, DRC of course. Not a single First Growth Bordeaux is mentioned. The result, in a market where demand far outstrips supply, is predictable.\n\nPrices are rocketing, with supply rated in single bottle lots! To illustrate, Romanee Conti 1990 is expected to command an auction price of HK$150,000 for ONE bottle. Mind-blowing. That is approximately S$25,000 at current exchange rates. One glass of this will cost S$3,125 (eight glasses per 750ml bottle.) You could buy a bottle of Lafite for the price of one glass of Romanee-Conti 1990. These statistics put the current prices into understandable perspective.\n\nFor the modest wine-lover, Burgundy (at the top end) is an out-of-reach luxury. What's the recourse? Bordeaux, tous jours Bordeaux - the first love for most wine lovers. Bearing this in mind, and to eke out my precious little store of Burgundy, I went back to Bordeaux recently and was very pleased to find that Bordeaux still provides great enjoyment and satisfaction.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}

This is, after all, Jaipur, capital of Rajasthan, India, and we are on the grounds of the beautiful and historic Rambagh Palace Hotel - the former residence of the Maharaja of Jaipur. A sense of Old World grandeur is everywhere - sprawling, immaculate gardens, marbled corridors, lofty domes and large portraits of the Maharajas of old lavishly decked out in their famously stunning jewels.\n\nAdding to the hotel's magical aura is word that Judi Dench and Richard Gere, both in India to film The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel 2, are guests. And so, along with the juicy prospect of bumping into these Hollywood stars (for some of us, at least), a 100-strong international media gathered recently to witness the launch of Italian jeweller Bulgari's latest in its Omnia range of fragrances - the Indian Garnet.\n\nThis scent comes on the back of steady sales for Bulgari's fragrance unit, which makes up the next best revenue-generating category after its number one division - jewellery. Fragrances contribute 23-25 per cent of the luxury brand's total annual revenue, and sales from the unit are expected to reach 150 million euros (S$264 million) this year.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}

Tourists have stayed away in droves ever since the emergency decree was imposed two months ago, which dealt a body blow to Thailand's key tourism sector during what would normally be a peak season. The street protests that began last November have eased, although many people remain spooked after the anti-government demonstrations that have claimed at least 23 lives - mostly in shootings and grenade blasts - and injured hundreds more. Scores of foreign companies postponed their plans to travel or do business in the kingdom, while many insurance companies refused to provide travel coverage.\n\nEven with the emergency rule gone, there is still a great deal of uncertainty in Bangkok, which remains one of the most popular tourism destinations in the world, especially among travellers in South-east Asia. The caretaker government's decision to end the state of emergency, while welcome, has been greeted with caution in some key markets because the Internal Security Act will be in force until the end of April to deal with protesters. Hong Kong, for instance, says it will continue to monitor the situation until next week before making any changes to its existing travel advisories for its citizens.\n\nThe prolonged political conflict in the Land of Smiles has already cost South-east Asia's second-largest economy more than US$3 billion, and six more months of similar unrest could result in a recession in 2014, the Board of Trade of Thailand and the Thai Chamber of Commerce (TCC) warned this week.

While his studio output is more sporadic, the five-time Grammy winner hasn't stopped performing around the world and his current All The Hits All Night Long tour comes to Singapore next month.\n\n\"I go to what I call the World gym,\" chuckles Richie cheekily, over the phone from Melbourne where he's playing a series of Australian shows, when asked what gives him the energy to keep going. \"It consists of one world tour a year; that will keep you fit forever.\"\n\nThe veteran chart-topper rose from humble beginnings in Tuskegee, Alabama, where he got his start in the music business with legendary R&B funk band, The Commodores. As singer and songwriter, he penned and performed many of their classic ballads including Easy, Sail On and Three Times A Lady.\n\nEasy was recently featured on his last album, Tuskegee, a career-spanning compilation of his hits re-recorded as duets. On the song's famous \"I wanna get high\" line, Willie Nelson asked Richie who would get to sing it. \"I told him, 'It's all yours',\" he laughed, in reference to the country superstar's many infamous brushes with the law over marijuana possession.\n\nTuskegee also includes Lady which he performs together with Kenny Rogers for the first time. Even though Richie wrote the song, it was the former who turned it into a big hit in 1980. Asked if he had any regrets about giving away the smash single - which Richie reveals was inspired by Rogers' marriage and relationship with his wife - he says, \"Not at all because not only did I gain a big hit, I also got a lifelong friend.\"\n\nThe 1980s also saw Richie going solo and finding even bigger success on his own, dominating the decade as one of pop music's biggest stars with hits such as All Night Long, Hello, Penny Lover, Stuck On You,Running With the Night - all from the album Can't Slow Down - plus more such as Say You Say Me and Dancing on the Ceiling.\n\nRichie adds he doesn't mind being known for his mushy ballads. That's because he professes to be \"a hopeless romantic whose problem is being in love with love\" in real-life.\n\n\"When I first started writing songs, my friends would say they are the sappiest, stickiest, gummiest songs they've ever heard and then one by one they started falling in love and my songs were the ones they played at their weddings,\" he says. \"Now their kids are getting married and using my songs as well, so how about that!\"\n\nGrowing up, he was \"painfully shy\" and did not have the confidence to talk to girls until he joined The Commodores. \"One night, I walked out on stage and some girl screamed and rushed to the stage; I came out of my shyness pretty fast after that,\" he laughs, adding it was at that point he knew he wanted to be a singer and not a lawyer or a tennis player, which he could have chosen to be because he was offered a scholarship to turn pro.\n\nHe even has some advice on how anybody can be a ladies man. \"Be funny,\" he says. \"I remember asking my mum and looking at my dad because I couldn't get the connection as to how they could be together; I said, 'Mum, what did dad say to convince you he would be the one?' and she said, 'He always made me laugh.'\"\n\nWith a hearty chuckle once again, he adds, \"So forget about muscles; muscles don't last, go find yourself some funny lines instead.\"\n\nLionel Richie's All The Hits All Night Long comes to the Singapore Indoor Stadium on 14th April. Tickets from $98 - $248 (excluding $4 booking fee) available for sale via Sports Hub Tix (tel: 6333 5000 or log on to\n\nwww.sportshubtix.sg\n\n) and at the Singapore Indoor Stadium Box Office and all SingPost outlets.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/getting-between-covers", "site_title": "Getting between the Covers", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nGetting between the Covers\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Mar 20, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nHEMAN Chong might have started out in his career as a video artist, in the early 2000s; and gained recognition as a multi-media artist and a conceptual one. These days however, he's better known as a painter, of imagined book covers.\n\nIn fact, this series has done so well that the sales have been able to support him as a full-time artist, since he started this series as Cover (Versions) in 2009. He's done 338 paintings to date, and this series has proven to be the \"magic formula\" that balances creativity and commercial viability.\n\n\"You don't get it, do you,\" he chides gently, when asked how many times he's held exhibitions of the same series (countless) and whether there are unsold pieces, which one assumes he incorporates into new series. His current series - Of Indeterminate Time or Occurrence - is now showing at Fost Gallery.\n\n\"I don't have anything left over - they're all sold at each show,\" he underscores. Collectors love this series, he points out matter-of-factly, because well, it's so collectable. He even has contractual agreements with three private collectors who have asked him to paint the same title every year for them.\n\n\"It started with this collector who bought the painting for The Wind Up Bird Chronicle and asked me to paint one each year. She has four now,\" he says.\n\nThis imagined book cover series is taken from a long list of books that Chong intends to read, and the only thing \"real\" about them are the titles and authors, while he covers the canvas in the painterly art of abstraction.\n\nThe works are modular, so it's easy to add on to an existing collection. Chong only paints them in 18 by 24-inch canvases, and while the paintings are abstract, the titles are always done in the same position and typeface. Plus, books are big in the history of paintings, as they represent learnedness. He also thinks that people do feel that having a literary reference on their wall - of a title they have read or aspire to read - gives them an intellectual air.\n\nThe interesting thing is that the 37-year-old artist only picked up the paintbrush in 2009, for this series. Trained as a graphic artist, and practised in conceptual, multi-media art, he's not had formal painting lessons. But the series grew out of an idea he had to design covers to wrap around his books, and he also wanted to explore different painting styles - expressionism, lines, fauvism and so on. \"But as I don't have a painting background, this isn't an academic venture for me. There's no baggage. I just do what I want.\"\n\nHe's disciplined at it though - as he paints daily. (And why wouldn't you, if it's your bread-and-butter.) \"But I do it as an exercise and discipline. To me, it's not about the grand gesture of painting, of creating masterpieces, but the small urgencies and capturing moments. My thought process is: 'I want to paint now, what will it be', and I see it as a response to a very basic need in life, like eating when you're hungry or taking a rest when you're tired.\"\n\n\"Everything for me is a reaction to minute necessities,\" he says blandly.\n\nIn the works, which cost $5,000 a pop, his graphic art background comes through, and a very natural sense and interplay of colours. \"Colours just come very easily to me. It's very instinctive. I know exactly what colours go next to each other,\" he says. As for his method, he works on nine paintings at a time, \"because that's just how many my drying rack can hold\"; and one painting spills over to another because he doesn't wash his brushes.\n\nBut honestly, the works have also been very popular because of a few important collectors, Chong admits. One of them is Michael Findlay, director of the Acquavella Gallery in New York, and former Christie's international art director. In the world of collecting, one thing collectors like to do is \"follow the guru\".\n\nBut gallerist Stephanie Fong also thinks that this series forces the collectors to take a more active role by involving them in some decision-making after they collect his works. \"At the elemental level, his works free one's mind of boundaries of what we might think 'art' is. I like that he challenges collectors not only at this level but in many works.\"\n\nChong isn't complaining, of course. \"Honestly, it's great that I have this series that supports me - so that I can have the freedom to create other things without worrying about applying for grants and funding,\" he says, with the classic distaste of an artist for things bureaucratic and structured.\n\nOf Indeterminate Time and Occurrence by Heman Chong, is now on until May 4, at Fost Gallery, 1 Lock Road, #01-02 Gillman Barracks. The gallery is open from 11am-7pm from Tue-Sat, and 11am-6pm on Sun. Please call 6694 3080 for more information\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Further weakness is expected. While local interest rates did not move, they are likely to rise in line with hikes in the United States, which could come as early as the fourth quarter of this year, some economists said.\n\nHome buyers should start relooking their loan packages if they are on floating rates, while importers may want to think about hedging their forex exposure, they advised.\n\nRoy Teo, ABN Amro Bank senior FX and precious metals strategist, said after Ms Yellen implied that the Fed could start hiking interest rates about six months after tapering concludes later this year, it pushes potential upside risk in USD/SGD towards this year's high of 1.2830.\n\n\"As the US economic growth momentum picks up later this year, the USD is expected to rise towards 1.30 against the SGD,\" he said.\n\nThe Fed said it would continue trimming its asset purchases and cut its monthly purchases of US Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to US$55 billion from US$65 billion, after it assessed that the recent weakness in the economy stemmed from adverse weather.\n\nUnited Overseas Bank (UOB) economist Francis Tan said that although the SGD would continue on an appreciating path against most of the currencies of its trading partners such as the ringgit, the trend would be different for the USD/SGD pair.\n\n\"We expect the SGD to weaken to 1.29 by end of the second quarter and to 1.33 by end of the fourth quarter this year,\" he said.\n\nOn interest rates, Mr Tan said the risk was that markets usually moved ahead of expected official policy, so US and Singapore interest rates could rise by Q4.\n\nUS Fed officials said the short-term rate could rise to one per cent at end-2015 and at 2.25 per cent by the end of 2016, from 0-0.25 per cent now.\n\n\"We can also expect some market volatility to set in in the second half of this year as the financial market tries to pre-empt the Fed by moving ahead of the curve at least six months earlier,\" said Selena Ling, OCBC Bank head, treasury research & strategy.\n\nUOB's Mr Tan forecast that by year-end, the key three-month Singapore interbank offered rate (Sibor) would rise to 0.56 per cent from 0.402 per cent now, and to 0.78 per cent by the end of Q1 next year.\n\n\"It is a reminder that rate normalisation in Asia is inevitable and will happen sooner than markets have expected,\" said Barclays senior Singapore economist Leong Wai Ho.\n\nAsian economies which are more in sync with the improving US business cycle will see their output gaps close faster and be in a position to hike sooner, he reckoned.\n\n\"In Singapore, when US rates are lifted to one per cent by end of 2015, we can expect three-month Sibor to climb by 30 basis points at least,\" said Mr Leong.\n\nHome buyers on floating rate home loans - about 70 per cent of borrowers - will be affected by the higher interest rates, said UOB's Mr Tan.\n\nFloating rate loans are typically pegged to the three-month Sibor.\n\n\"Rates may go up faster than we think,\" he warned.\n\nMs Ling felt that interest rate normalisation is positive for Asian economies.\n\n\"We think that Yellen's remarks are on balance net positive for Asia in that a stronger US economy, even if accompanied by US interest rate normalisation down the road, should benefit economies and businesses in Asia, especially on the export and manufacturing front,\" she said.\n\nImporters should consider hedging their US dollar exposure, said Mr Tan.\n\nTom McCabe, DBS Bank head of global transaction services, said three questions on currency exposure come to mind: Do I need to hedge my cost base or my expected revenues; will the increase in cost of USD-priced goods reduce demand for my products or services; and are any of my suppliers or buyers at risk because of currency fluctuations.\n\n\"For companies doing business across Asia, these questions apply to all currencies, not just USD,\" he said.\n\nThe impact on asset pricing will be different however, said Ms Ling.\n\nIn the near term at least, there will likely be some volatility in interest rates, bonds, equities and currencies though investors do not need to panic, she said.\n\n\"It is better to wait for the knee-jerk market reaction to stabilise and watch for opportunities to hedge any floating rate exposure where relevant.\n\n\"The Sing dollar, for its part, will likely trade off the stronger US dollar dynamics as well, like other Asian currencies, but the trade-weighted basket provides a partial anchor of sorts.\"\n\nNot all think the SGD will slide that much as the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is likely to maintain its modest and appreciating stance given inflationary pressures here.\n\nThe SGD will not be excessively weakened, given the keeping of MAS's \"modest and gradual\" SGD appreciation stance, and continued trade-related inflows on a recovering US economy, said Leong Sook Mei, Asean head of global markets research, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.\n\n\"The only prolonged period of SGD depreciation in recent times from the 1.4 to 1.8 handle were during the 1997-2001 Asian crisis and dot-com bubble periods. USD/SGD should go back down towards 1.2600 by year-end,\" said Ms Leong.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But he was in fact extremely shy, and putting on that eccentric front seemed to be his way of dealing with strangers, feels Christine Argillet. And she should know, as she practically spent every summer staying opposite Dali's house, from the time she was five years old to her late teens, because of her father's work with Dali.\n\n\"He was perfectly normal with people he was familiar with, and he was friends with everyone - from the children to the fisherman, or old ladies who crocheted their lace in the village of Cadaques, in Spain. In fact, what impressed me was that he had no airs whatsoever, and he was constantly seeking everyone's opinions and views of his art,\" shares Ms Argillet. Her father, Pierre Argillet, was an avid collector of Futurist, Dadaist and Surrealist works in the early 20th century.\n\nBut it was with Dali that he developed a long collaboration.

His death in December last year marked the end of an extraordinary life and in truth, so immense was his stature as a political figure and world leader that any movie about his life would have struggled to do justice to the man.\n\nMandela: Long Walk to Freedom is an ambitious project that took years to complete and is based on Mandela's 1994 autobiography of the same name, chronicling his formative years, early career and the 27 years he spent in prison before becoming President of South Africa. Despite the inspirational material at its disposal, the film - well made and watchable - doesn't have the same capacity as its subject to rise above the crowd and make a lasting impact.\n\nUniversally admired as a great man who fought for a just cause, Nelson Mandela was a lawyer-turned activist in apartheid-era South Africa. His place in the history books as a human rights campaigner and defiant symbol of the anti-apartheid movement is assured, so there was always a danger that Long Walk to Freedom, directed by Justin Chadwick and written by William Nicholson, could have been a 21/2 -hour long tribute piece. To its credit, the film tries to portray him as a flawed but driven human being, thrust by circumstances and a strong sense of righteousness into the glare of history.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n4\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\n5\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal", "images": []}

The two races are part of a glut of non-competitive themed runs that have gripped Singapore over the past year.\n\nThere were at least six such runs last year and the number is expected to rise with many organisers bringing their races back for a second year and new ones such as the Electric Run, Foam Run and the Heroes Run joining the circuit in coming months.\n\nThe runs are highly popular, drawing up to 10,000 participants each time, with several selling out within days and even hours of their launch. But the organisers of these races themselves aren't racing to the banks even with the overwhelming public response.\n\nLogistically, these events are expensive to organise. Randy Tan, general manager of Infinitus, which last year organised the Illumi Run, estimates that a third of his costs go into collaterals such as goodie bags to \"create value to participants\", while another third goes into operational costs such as managing road closures and engaging a reliable medical team for emergencies. \"Safety and medical precautions are not something we want to stinge on.\"\n\nCelebrity Trainer's business development director Brandon Lee agrees, noting that Race the Dead cost nearly $1million to execute. However, the race did boost demand for Celebrity Trainer's main business, which is home coaching services. \"Our events serve as a good marketing platform for our lifestyle classifieds,\" he explains.\n\nEven though Race the Dead was the first running event Celebrity Trainer has organised, its success has prompted them to spin off a new comic book-themed race called the Heroes Run this year.\n\nAdam Baurely, whose background is in boutique investment and American oil and gas start-ups, had no experience in event planning. But it did not deter him from moving to Singapore in 2011 to organise Lion Dash, a race which features a variety of obstacles designed to challenge participants. \"I saw a market in Asia for these races but I wanted to start in Singapore,\" he says.\n\nOrganisers are also making sure each event has its own identity and unique selling point. Infinitus's Illumi Run, which it organised last year, saw participants running around a party circuit with neon lights and live DJs.\n\n\"With competitive races, participants are often focused on a specific target or timing they want to achieve,\" says Mr Tan. \" In a non-competitive run, however, you sign up with your friends and family and really have fun. There's no pressure.\"\n\n\"They are fun, they are social and a unique participatory experiences,\" adds Dave Landa, founder of Electric Run in the United States, where LED light-decked runners run, walk or dance to party music. Electric Run is scheduled to have its inaugural race in Singapore on the 11th and 12th of April next month.\n\nBut as the industry becomes increasingly saturated with themed races, will Singaporeans get tired of running from zombies and be blas\u00e9 about glow sticks and DJs? According to Timothy Tan, chief operations officer of Action X, organisers of Run for Your Lives, creativity and upgrading is key. \"Themed runs are here to stay if we continue to innovate,\" he says.\n\nBut Mr Lee adopts a different view. \"I don't think that the trend is here to stay. There's a limit to innovation. That's why we are looking to take our projects overseas,\" he says.\n\nLikewise for Infinitus's Mr Tan, who hopes to franchise the Illumi Run concept regionally. \"Ten thousand participants may seem like a large crowd here, but it's just a fraction of the market overseas,\" he says. \"And just as people are bringing more foreign runs in, why not bring a made-in-Singapore brand we can be proud of overseas?\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This has been driven by the recovery of advanced economies like the United States and Europe as well as continued growth in Asia and emerging markets.\"\n\nMs Teo added that since Asia was poised for continued growth, the region would be the \"key engine behind global trade growth, both today and in the medium term\".\n\n\"The IHS (publishing group) predicts that Far East-Europe seaborne containerised trade will grow at 4.6 per cent per annum from 2014 to 2016, while intra-Asia seaborne containerised trade is expected to grow at 5.8 per cent per annum from 2014 to 2016. As a result, Asia's share of global seaborne trade is expected to increase to more than 40 per cent in the years ahead,\" she said.\n\nShipping analysts and shipowners gathered at the three-day bi-annual event agreed that things are finally steadying after what have been a tumultuous few years for the global maritime industry.\n\nAccording to Bimco chief shipping analyst Peter Sand, 2014 is expected \"to be a better year in terms of both demand and supply than what 2013 had in store\". He added that Asia's role in the maritime industry will continue to grow and fuel the global shipping sector.\n\nRoberto Cazzulo, chairman of the International Association of Classification Societies Council, agreed.\n\n\"Asia will continue to play an increasingly important role in shipping in the next five years,\" he said, citing the main drivers that would continue to sustain the Asian lead in the maritime industry as: shipping of bulk commodities and containerised trade to Asian countries, notably China and India, top-notch port operators, ever increasing ship-building quality and competencies, the ability to create maritime clusters with Singapore being a very significant example, and policymakers' sensibility in supporting the maritime industry.\n\nOthers, however, warned that improvements to the industry's prospects are marginal and that indicators are far from what they were before the global financial crisis in 2008-09, particularly within the traditional shipping segments.\n\n\"The liner shipping industry is in a challenging environment (and) has been since 2008,\" said Jeremy Nixon, CEO of NYK Group South Asia, who added that 2014 looked to be as challenging a year as 2013. \"We have to face the reality that demand is not as strong now as it used to be pre-2008.\"\n\nThomas Kriwat, CEO of Mercantile Shipping Company, agreed that it was too early to cheer as challenges still existed for shipowners. \"Everyone is assuming that the market is getting back to normal and we saw some signs in 2010. But now we are in 2014 and we are still not far away from where we were in 2009.\"\n\nDespite growth in the sector still being gradual, the sector appears upbeat about prospects and this is reflected by the turnout at this year's APM, which is the largest to date with some 15,000 participants from over 60 countries, up from almost 13,000 in 2012.\n\nThis year's exhibition also saw a more than 15 per cent growth in exhibition floor space to 21,000 square metres, as compared to the last edition in 2012, when 1,518 participating companies from 60 countries showcased their products and services.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Under the veil of anonymity, a majority of companies have been candid enough to declare in a poll that they will not - as required under revised corporate governance guidelines - openly and fully reveal the remuneration of individual directors and the chief executive, citing mainly confidentiality and fear of poaching.\n\nCompliance with the Code of Corporate Governance is essentially voluntary but the guidelines - updated in 2012 - spell out the disclosure standards expected, if not industry-wide best practices in key global markets. No doubt, compensation details tend to be a highly sensitive issue, particularly with CEOs whose pay is multiples of rank-and-file wages. But the spotlight on executive remuneration and increased regulation around governance of late have come in response to the corporate crises and scandals, and public outcry over excessive CEO compensation, over the decade. In any case, top management commanding million-dollar pay packets, especially those at the helm of public companies, should know that full remuneration disclosure is par for the course. And any company that can easily argue why their CEO is worth every cent that he or she is paid should have no issue publishing the pay figures.\n\nBut it is not just the requirements around executive pay disclosure that companies are not heeding, going by the findings of the survey, conducted jointly by the Singapore Institute of Directors, Singapore Exchange, Egon Zehnder International and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Apparently, their remuneration systems also are not quite up to mark in terms of being aligned with long-term interests and prudent risk-taking. While the Code recommends that companies activate contractual claw-backs, nine in 10 firms do not have any such provision to recover bonuses or any excessive payment in the event of fraud or crisis, and only 2 per cent said that they were considering addressing the issue over the next 12 months.\n\nOne must wonder just why a company would not care to take steps to essentially protect itself and its shareholders. Few can plead ignorance about the various governance standards recommended as good and sound practices, given the extensive discussions on the Code in the business community in recent years. Perhaps most companies are too occupied with the day-to-day running of their business to take a step back and consider the broader \"backdrop\", and matters that may not seem to have any direct nor immediate impact on the bottom line - such as disclosure issues or greater board diversity. That would be short-sighted, as corporate success today is increasingly about balancing the demands of all stakeholders, including regulators; and, studies show, well-governed companies do better too.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Albedo called for a share trading halt at 10.15 am.\n\nVoyage Research head Roger Tan said: \"The Star article has created great turmoil in Singapore in the stock. A lot of shortists are taking advantage to short the counter.\"\n\nThe reverse takeover is critical to the outlook for Albedo, which recently announced a further net loss of $1.2 million for the year ended December, Mr Tan added.\n\n\"When Albedo made the announcement that they were going to go into Iskandar, the shares shot up quite a bit,\" he said. \"The Star article has claimed it's not going to go through, and the price has come down, which means investors were really hoping for this to go through.\"\n\nWhile acknowledging that Albedo probably needed time to react, Mr Tan said that it would have been ideal if the company could have responded faster.\n\n\"I think the moment that they see this article in the morning . . . the company should have taken immediate steps,\" he said.\n\nDavid Gerald, president of the retail shareholder advocacy group Securities Investors Association of Singapore, said that it would be better if Albedo could shed some light on the timing of its actions.\n\n\"Timely information is required from companies to maintain an orderly market,\" Mr Gerald said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Following that, the \"strong share price performance provided CapitaLand the opportunity to fully unlock value in its remaining investment in Australand\", it said.\n\nCitigroup Global Markets Australia acted as the sole bookrunner and underwriter for the secondary placement, expected to be completed on March 24.\n\nOCBC Investment Research analyst Eli Lee said: \"We have a favourable view on this action and believe the market will likely take this positively as well, given the possibility of a special dividend from the sale proceeds later this year.\"\n\nHe added: \"Strategically, this divestment will further simplify the group's structure and enable management to recycle capital into key markets - Singapore and China. The sale is estimated to further boost the group's cash holdings to approximately $6.9 billion and reduce gearing to about 29 per cent.\"\n\nLast month, CapitaLand posted a 45.6 per cent decline in fourth-quarter net profit to $142.9 million, due largely to one-off losses and higher impairments. Excluding the one-off Australand divestment loss in November, net profit would have risen by 0.4 per cent to $263.7 million, it said.\n\nCapitaLand shares fell two cents to end trading at $2.72 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Designed by RSP Architects, the building includes the 300-room five-star Park Hotel and a ground-floor retail podium.\n\nFarrer Square is expected to be ready in 2017. It will be directly linked to neighbouring Connexion, which houses the 220-bed Farrer Park Hospital, a hotel and medical suites. It will also be connected via existing MRT underground pedestrian walkways to City Square Mall.\n\nRB Capital's medical suites are between 500 and 1,000 square feet in size, with the ability to combine units. These suites have a high ceiling, with a floor-to-ceiling height of between 4.9 and six metres, one of the highest around, said Mr Kishin.\n\n\"The high floor-to-ceiling height gives it a very open and luxurious feel,\" he told BT in a recent interview.\n\nThe company is open to both doctors and investors buying the suites, but said it would give priority to medical professionals.\n\n\"We have seen healthy interest and are speaking to specialists and medical groups before talking to the investors,\" said Karamjit Singh, head of investments and residential at Jones Lang LaSalle, the appointed property consultant and marketing agent for Farrer Square medical suites. \"The response so far has been encouraging.\"\n\nBesides the medical suites, other facilities in Farrer Square, including certain rooms at Park Hotel Farrer Park, are also being developed for the medical market.\n\nMr Kishin said: \"We have over 60 family lofts, which will cater very comfortably to medical tourism, housing more than three to four people per room.\"\n\nThese rooms, around 20-per cent larger than regular rooms, will be split over two floors. Extra amenities include a sofa bed - potentially for caregivers to rest while looking after patients - and a kitchenette.\n\nBeyond the physical arrangements, Park Hotel will also be rolling out additional services for medical tourists.\n\nSaid CEO of Park Hotel Group Allen Law: \"When the hotel opens, we will be introducing targeted medical tourism packages for medical travellers and their family members with the aim of providing them a seamless experience from airport, hospital and to the hotel.\"\n\nThese packages include airport pick-up, interpretation assistance for non-English speaking patients, and provision for special dietary requirements, Mr Law said.\n\nWhile all 42 medical suites will be for sale, the ground-floor retail units - which will house retail complementary to the medical suites - will be for lease only, said Mr Kishin.\n\nFarrer Square is one of at least five integrated developments, which house medical suites, currently being built. Others include Royal Square in Novena, SBF Center in the CBD, Vision Exchange in Jurong East and Connexion, which is across the road from Farrer Square. Together, these will add some 500 units - around 35 per cent of current medical-suite supply of 1,400 - to the market.\n\nRB Capital said pricing of the medical suites will be revealed only when it is closer to the launch, but it added that the company would use the rest of the market as indication.\n\nAccording to URA caveats, prices in the past six months for units at the neighbouring Connexion were around $4,200 psf. Units at Royal Square, which were launched late last year, have been selling at around $4,350 psf on average. More established medical suites, such as Gleneagles and Mount Elizabeth, have traded around $6,000 to $7,500 psf in the last year.\n\nMr Kishin said: \"As Singapore continually evolves as a top travel destination for tourists, and positions itself as a regional healthcare hub, there are phenomenal growth opportunities in the real-estate industry, specifically in the medical tourism sector, which influenced the creation of our fourth business engine, RB Capital Healthcare.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We don't want to open ourselves up to the possibility of regulatory backlash if we haven't done our research right.\"\n\nThe regulations that MAS proposed last week will oblige bitcoin exchanges, brokers and machine operators to verify the identities of their customers and report suspicious transactions. These rules are expected to kick in within the next 12 months.\n\nTembusu's second machine, parked at a business centre called the Eclat Office Club on Mohamed Sultan Road, does not have know-your-customer (KYC) functions installed, though these can be retrofitted, Mr Luo said.\n\nSingapore has seven bitcoin machines operated by three players, all of them offerring only a one-way, cash-in function that allows for fiat currency to be converted into bitcoin.\n\nFor one of the operators, the reticence over having the cash-out function pre-dates the MAS announcement.\n\nNumoni, which has four bitcoin vending machines here, will not implement the function for now because of the risks involved in accepting bitcoins for fiat currency, such as the difficulty in determining where a user got his bitcoin from.\n\nIts chief executive Norma Sit said that Numoni will observe the market and keep an eye on MAS' views on the matter.\n\nEven so, potential new entrant Coin Republic is set to test these uncharted cash-out waters. The local outfit is bringing in a bitcoin ATM that has both cash-in and cash-out functions.\n\nThe machine was to have been launched on Monday, but a problem cropped up with the machine's barcode scanner, said Coin Republic founder David Moskowitz.

My clear understanding is that capital markets still have to adjust to the freight markets.\"\n\nHe said that the process of consolidation could take quite a few years, and although shipowners are streamlining their businesses and raising their efficiency, \"there is only so much we can do\".\n\nHence, in terms of pricing, he said that shipowners need to ask themselves whether the transport service that they provide to the global economy is priced fairly.\n\nThe entry of these mega-vessels into Singapore and the region is also likely to affect smaller vessels and the feedering segment, a line of business for his company, he said.\n\nMahesh Sivaswamy, the chairman and chief executive of Transworld Group, agreed, saying: \"From the feedering angle, which we are involved in, the cascading effect possibly comes to a stop somewhere at about 3,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units).\"\n\nHe said that the trend of alliances among carriers is worsening the situation for smaller carriers, with many of the shipping companies adopting the mantra, \"Go big or go home\".\n\n\"With this excess capacity, carriers will have to discount rates to enjoy economies of scale. This ultimately forces the smaller carriers out of the market,\" he said.\n\nHowever, industry players warn that it is too early to write off smaller vessels, because infrastructure and functional needs still drive the demand for them.\n\nMr Kriwat told the conference that a recent study by his company of 550 of the most important global container ports found that about half of them are accessible only to vessels with capacities of below 3,000 TEUs.\n\nHe added that the study showed that the market for smaller vessels was therefore still protected and that their importance will remain \"for at least another 10 years\".\n\nJeremy Nixon, the chief executive of NYK Line, pointed out that the introduction of mega vessels also had implications for infrastructure and support services. A lot of the current terminals are geared to handle 13,000-TEU capacity ships, which will become the standard size of ships in the long-run.\n\nHowever, vessels in the future may be built to have capacities of up to 23,000 TEUs; he noted that although these mega vessels may be only about 40 metres longer than mid-sized ships, their intake could be up to 20 to 30 per cent more.\n\n\"This means the terminals will have to improve their productivity or they will not achieve economies of scale,\" he said.\n\nAnd this, he warned, could pose a big challenge to shipowners who may not be able to receive terminal productivity support despite having larger ships.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In line with previous offerings such as The Royal Tenenbaums (2001), The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004), Fantastic Mr Fox (2009) and Moonrise Kingdom (2012), the director's eighth film comes equipped with original thinking, witty dialogue and production values that put most Hollywood blockbusters in the shade. It doesn't always work, but there's no denying the fun to be had in trying.\n\nThis time around, Anderson sets his sights on a bygone era in Europe between the wars and a way of life in a vanished world. There are several grand dames in the story and the eponymous hotel of the title - regal, elegant and faintly mysterious before a sharp descent into shabbiness - puts in a star turn too, but the glue that holds the entire enterprise together is Gustave H, a concierge who wears powerful cologne and starched shirts while running the hotel with a meticulous style rooted in old-school ways.\n\nThe hotel sits on a mountaintop in a fictional Germanic country and enjoyed its heyday in the 1930s, when it was a vacation spot of choice for the rich and titled. The film is constructed as a story-within-a-story and begins when a writer (Tom Wilkinson) tells of his visit to the hotel as a young man (Jude Law) in the 1960s, when it was already an enchanting old ruin, with threadbare carpets and sloppy service standards.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n4\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\n5\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal", "images": []}

It's about cost, and who's going to help to bring them into the next market.\"\n\nA UOB survey of over 800 SMEs in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand in the fourth quarter of 2012 showed that most small businesses put market expansion as a top priority, and flagged rising costs and currency risks as key concerns.\n\n\"In today's world, where everything is so seamless, and transparent, profit margins are tightening, and customers do not want to carry that currency risk,\" Mr Lee said.\n\nCurrency risk also affects a large percentage of UOB's small-business customers, since 40 per cent of them are in the wholesale trading and manufacturing sectors, Mr Lee said.\n\nTo that end, UOB has set up a team of 40 FX specialists who will offer hedging services, as well as offer business cash flow analysis and insights into financial market trends to small businesses. The team will be spread across four markets: Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.\n\nAlongside this, UOB has launched a new mobile application here to provide real-time FX information, news, and research reports. App users will be alerted when the price of a currency hits a specified level. Customers can then reach an FX specialist from the bank to execute a trade, and in some instances, enjoy preferential rates.\n\nAbout 14 per cent of UOB's small-business customers use hedging solutions, and UOB expects this to hit 30 per cent in three years. Popular currency pairs include the US dollar versus the Singapore dollar (SGD), and the SGD against the ringgit.\n\nMr Lee said the new service was akin to providing a \"virtual relationship manager\" to such companies.\n\n\"Small businesses have had no access to financial advice. These were only available to large corporates in the past,\" he said.\n\nThere is clear competition in the SME space in Singapore and the region, with two out of three customers having relationships with two banks.

The stock of Noble has risen 15 per cent since Feb 5, closing at $1.075 yesterday.\n\nWilmar, when asked about its partnership with ADM during its results briefing last month, said that both share a \"very close\" relationship. \"(But) unless conditions for marriage is good, we'll just work closely together,\" said chief executive officer Kuok Khoon Hong. \"Right now, the conditions for marriage is not right, so we'll still prefer to be single.\"\n\nADM and Wilmar have worked together since the 1990s when both jointly built a network of soyabean processing operations in China. They have also entered into a partnership in global fertilisers, European vegetable oil and global ocean freight.\n\nThe Kuok family owns 18.3 per cent of Wilmar, which has gained 11 per cent in its price since Feb 5.

Mr Wang would not confirm this number.\n\nSuch private fund-raising is common but illegal in China, and regulatory concerns about companies using such backdoor channels to secretly increase their leverage have led to numerous court cases, including one death penalty sentence.\n\nThe financial office employee said that Wu Yongben, head of the city financial office, was currently in a meeting with representatives of China Construction Bank and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank discussing how to resolve their outstanding loans to Zhejiang Xingrun.\n\nCalls to Zhejiang Xingrun, China Construction Bank and Shanghai Pudong Development seeking comment were not answered.\n\n\"As far as we know, this is the largest property developer in recent years that is at risk of bankruptcy,\" wrote Zhang Zhiwei of Nomura Securities in a research note. \"We believe more property developers will face similar pressures as transaction volumes slow and cash flow conditions tighten.\"\n\nBankruptcies and bank loan defaults in China are common, but the size of Zhejiang Xingrun's outstanding loans, and the fact that the near-bankruptcy troubles come shortly after China's first public bond default on March 7, rattled investors.\n\n\"While this news will definitely impact some property stocks, I don't think a domino effect is likely,\" said Du Changchun, an analyst at Northeast Securities in Shanghai.\n\nMeanwhile, stocks and bonds issued by some Chinese real estate companies extended a slump as fears about Zhejiang Xingrun stoked concern that defaults are starting to mount as the economy slows and the government reins in lending.\n\nThe housing market in the world's second-biggest economy is cooling with the value of home sales falling 5 per cent in the first two months of the year after local governments stepped up measures to curb rising prices.\n\nThe 7.5 per cent economic expansion targeted by China this year would be the slowest since 1990.\n\n\"Chinese developers are extremely exposed to the easy credit that's used to finance purchases and investment,\" said Patrick Chovanec, the New York-based chief strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management Group LLC, which oversees US$14.1 billion in assets. \"When credit is reined in even slightly, it undercuts demand. This is potentially an inflection point.\"\n\n\"This is a far more serious situation than Chaori Solar's default, as it hits right at the heart of China's property boom,\" Mark Bayley, a credit strategist at Aquasia Pty in Sydney, said in a report on Monday.\n\n\"The real danger now is that banks will considerably tighten liquidity afforded to the real estate and property development sectors.\"\n\nAt least 10 Chinese cities stepped up measures to cool local property markets at the end of last year with Shenzhen, Shanghai and Guangzhou raising the minimum downpayments for second homes to 70 per cent from 60 per cent.\n\nNew-home price growth slowed last month led by Beijing, Shenzhen, Shanghai and Guangzhou, the four cities the government defines as first tier, the National Bureau of Statistics said yesterday.\n\nPrices in Beijing and Shenzhen each rose 0.2 per cent in February from a month earlier while they added 0.4 per cent in Shanghai, the smallest increase since November 2012, and gained 0.5 per cent in Guangzhou.\n\nPrices advanced in 57 of the 70 cities the government tracks, versus 62 in January.\n\nThe collapse of Zhejiang Xingrun doesn't necessarily herald the start of defaults in rated dollar bonds sold by other Chinese developers, according to Charles Macgregor, Lucror Analytics Pte's Singapore-based head of Asia.\n\n\"We don't believe investors holding US dollar-denominated property bonds should be concerned, given generally sound issuer fundamentals and low probability of default,\" Mr Macgregor added.\n\nSome 66 per cent of new Chinese developer dollar bonds sold this year are trading below their issue price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nChinese property shares slid to a 16-month low in February after Industrial Bank Co suspended mezzanine financing for developers, adding to concern that smaller developers may default on their borrowings amid the government's property curbs and an economic slowdown.\n\nYesterday, China Vanke Co and Poly Real Estate Group Co, China's biggest developers, slumped at least one per cent after official data showed the number of cities that reported housing-price gains fell last month.\n\n\"Investors are cautious of property stocks as corporate bond risks are pretty high,\" explained Zeng Xianzhao, an analyst at Everbright Securities Co. \"They are selectively choosing stocks before more policy measures are rolled out.\" - Reuters, Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

Chinese tourists make up more than a third of visitors to South Korea, where Japan's Sega Sammy Holdings and casino operator Genting Singapore are also seeking licences to build.\n\n\"Korea is the optimal location to draw Chinese bettors,\" Song Hak Jun, a professor at hotel and convention management department at Pai Chai University in Daejon, South Korea, said before yesterday's announcement.\n\n\"Everyone is competing to absorb the China's outbound tourist demand. Having casino resorts will bring initial explosive growth to Korea, too.\"\n\nSouth Korea plans to draw 10 million Chinese visitors a year by 2020, compared with 4.3 million last year, an increase of 53 per cent from 2012, according to data from Korea Tourism Organization. Chinese visitors made up 36 per cent of foreign visitors to Korea last year, and accounted for 41 per cent of visits to the country's casinos in 2012, according to the latest official data.\n\nAll but one of South Korea's 17 casinos are open only to foreigners. Their combined revenue was 2.46 trillion won in 2012, according to the latest available data, and attracted 5.4 million bettors. Revenue at foreign-only casinos grew by an average of 15 per cent a year for the five years through 2012, the data show.\n\n\"Tourism is the most feasible sector that can enlarge South Korea's economy quickly enough and integrated resorts with casinos will definitely be a help,\" said Ryu Kwang Hoon, director at tourism policy department at Seoul-based research Korea Culture & Tourism Institute.\n\nThe Caesars-Lippo venture will spend 743.7 billion won in the first phase of the project by 2018 and a total of 2.3 trillion won eventually as it builds hotels, residential buildings, casino, convention centres and shopping malls, the ministry said.\n\nThe casino will only be open to foreigners, the tourism ministry said. The project may add more than 890 billion won in tourism income from new visitors and create more than 8,000 jobs during construction from 2014 and 2018, the ministry said.\n\nThe venture plans to open the Incheon resort in time for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, Caesars said yesterday.\n\nCaesars, the largest owner of US casinos, is entering the South Korean market after failing to secure an operating licence in Macau. Six operators, including US-based Las Vegas Sands, MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts hold concessions in the world's biggest gambling hub.\n\nSega Sammy, the video game and pachinko machine company, and Paradise, South Korea's biggest casino operator, are also seeking to spend 1.9 trillion won to build a hotel, foreigner-only casino and a shopping mall in Incheon. The companies plan to complete the first part of the project by 2017, Paradise said in October.\n\nGenting Singapore, South-east Asia's largest casino operator by market value, said last month that it will develop a US$2.2 billion casino resort on South Korea's Jeju island with Chinese property company Landing International Development.\n\n\"The approval of the Caesar-Lippo project will be a watershed to gauge the government's will towards the casino industry,\" Thomas Bae, a service industry analyst at Woori Investment & Securities in Seoul, said before yesterday's announcement.\n\n\"The casino industry has superb growth potential and if the regulatory hurdle is lowered, it would further bolster foreign investors' appetite in the industry.\"\n\nShares of Paradise, the biggest casino operator in South Korea, have surged more than 10 times since the beginning of 2009. They soared as much as 14 per cent to a record high yesterday.\"Today's news about Lippo-Caesars seems to boost Paradise and other shares, too,\" said Han Ik Hee, a Seoul-based analyst at Hyundai Securities. Mr Han rates Paradise as \"buy\".\n\nSouth Korea plans to ease rules on the casino industry to draw foreign capital, boost investment and create jobs as part of a four-year plan to boost the tourism industry, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism said on Feb 3.\n\nThe government plans to develop a \"Korean model\" of integrated casino resorts and lower regulations on investors' financial capacity as long as applicants prove sufficient funding plans, the ministry said at the time.\n\n\"Tourism is an area we can add lots of values with just a simple change of conception,\" Ms Park said in a Feb 3 meeting with government officials and industry participants, according to a statement on her office's website.\n\n\"We should actively lift the industry's competitiveness by eliminating unnecessary regulations.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

In general, we have become very used to huge vessels crossing the oceans. Not so long ago, many would have dismissed the idea of containerships reaching capacities in excess of 17,000 TEU (twenty foot equivalent units). That is now today's reality.\n\nBut every now and again, there are incidents that should warn against complacency and the attitude that all technical issues have been addressed. The 2007 hull failure and eventual break-up of the 4,734 TEU MSC Napoli was one such case. That focused attention on both structural strength and the need to know exactly what is in every container shipped.\n\nLast year, the loss of the Bahamas- flagged 8,000 TEU MOL Comfort, thankfully without fatalities or serious injuries, once again put the issue of structural strength in the limelight. This was a large vessel by historic standards, but much smaller than the biggest now in service. She suffered a fracture amidships while crossing the Indian Ocean from Singapore to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on June 17. The ship subsequently split into two, which remained afloat and drifted for some days before eventually sinking.\n\nOf course, the loss of this vessel caused considerable concern and it has been investigated with the thoroughness you would expect from an official Japanese enquiry. The Committee on Large Container Ship Safety issued an interim report on the incident in December and a provisional English translation has been made available. It makes for interesting, but troubling reading. The report notes that the ship experienced hogging (longitudinal bending), causing the ship's midship section to fracture. According to those on board, the upper deck area was the last part to fracture. From this, the report says, it can be assumed that the crack which triggered the fracture began below the waterline in the bottom part of the ship's hull and then progressed upwards along the side of the ship. The fracture is believed to have started in the bottom shell plates of No 6 cargo hold.\n\nSafety inspections of MOL Comfort's sisterships were carried out rapidly and they found buckling deformations of around 20mm in the bottom shell plates. The ship's maintenance and inspections records showed buckling had been found in the way of No 5 hold, forward of the presumed fracture point.\n\nStructural and wave-load analyses under the sea state condition at the time of the accident were also carried out. In simple terms, the investigators could not replicate the conditions that would have caused the ship to break up. So the committee is still trying to work out what happened. But it has recommended temporary safety measures for existing containerships with loading capacities similar to or greater than 8,000 TEU.\n\nUnsurprisingly, bottom shell plates should be checked for buckling deformations. In addition, and very much in line with the lessons learnt from the MSC Napoli, the committee says that International Maritime Organization guidelines on weighing containers prior to loading, which are likely to be agreed on later this year, should be implemented now.\n\nThe committee's researchers are set to carry out a lot more technical analysis on the stresses on large containerships and there is no doubt that this will eventually feed down into the design of the next generation of megaships. But in the meantime, the focus should perhaps be making the \"box\" a lot less anonymous.\n\nRemember that we are actually talking about very large cargo ships, and the cargo is not containers at all, it is their contents. Containers are just neat, easily handled packages for cargo of all sorts, from tee shirts to computers. But cargo can also include dangerous and/or inflammable commodities. Sometime after the MOL Comfort had broken in two, a fire started in the forward section and completely burnt out that part of the ship, which then sank. It would be good to know what caused the fire and why it proved so devastating.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Home prices have risen 24 per cent since a post-bubble low in March 2012, which was about when corporate buyers started their buying spree, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller index.\n\nThe rate of US foreclosure starts fell to its lowest level in eight years in the fourth quarter as higher prices allowed more delinquent homeowners to sell without taking a loss, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.\n\nJade Rahmani, an analyst for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said that large investors are focusing on fewer locations as they gain experience and prices go up.\n\n\"Home prices have increased, which narrows the acquisition opportunity,\" Mr Rahmani said. \"In addition, these companies have done this for a certain amount of time and there are lessons learned.\"\n\nWhile institutional purchases nationwide fell to a 22-month low in January, corporate investors were more active in the Atlanta region, buying 25 per cent of homes sold, according to data firm RealtyTrac. That helped drive up Atlanta prices 37 per cent since the March 2012 trough.\n\nLast week, a group of 80 tenant and neighbourhood advocacy organisations, including the National Community Reinvestment Coalition and the National Consumer Law Center, asked federal regulators \"to address first-time homebuyers being outbid, tenants being displaced, and neighbourhoods undergoing dramatic changes as private equity and investor cash continues flooding into local housing markets\".\n\nMr Gray said that the influence of corporate investors on home prices has been exaggerated. They represent at most 10 per cent of the two million homes bought by investors in the last two years, according to Mr Rahmani.\n\n\"There's a narrative out there that institutional buyers are driving the market,\" he said.\n\n\"But the reality is that institutional buyers are in a relatively limited number of markets, their buying is tapering and yet home prices continue to go up at a pretty strong clip nationally - even in markets where institutional buyers haven't purchased a single home.\"\n\nAt the height of its activity, Blackstone's Invitation Homes made purchases that may have comprised as much as 6 per cent of sales for several months in one or more of its 14 markets, Mr Gray said. This may have had a short-term impact on prices, he added.\n\n\"We definitely helped alleviate excess distressed housing stock,\" he said. \"We weren't 5 or 6 per cent for a sustainable period of time in any market.\"\n\nAmerican Homes 4 Rent has slowed its buying in some of its 42 markets, CEO David Singelyn said at a March 5 investor conference in Florida.\n\nIt added 2,001 homes in the quarter ending Dec 31, down 32 per cent from the previous quarter's 2,941 homes, according to a statement over the weekend. It added 1,533 homes in January and February, bringing its total inventory to 24,801.\n\nThe benefit of being in 22 states is that the California-based company has the ability to move within many locations and \"buy as the opportunities ebb and flow\", Mr Singelyn said.\n\nColony Financial, a Reit that invests in Colony American Homes, slowed its funding for acquisitions last year to focus on improving operations, CEO Richard Saltzman said last November.\n\nColony Financial has been gradually allocating less to the landlord business and capped its investment at US$550 million for the quarter ending Dec 31, Mr Saltzman said last month.\n\nColony American, which owns 16,000 homes, declined to comment, according to Owen Blicksilver, an outside spokesman for the landlord. American Homes 4 Rent chief financial officer Peter Nelson didn't reply to a message seeking comment.\n\nAmerican Residential Properties, a landlord with 6,000 homes, slowed acquisitions by almost half in its latest quarter ending Dec 31. It invested US$104 million in 633 homes compared with US$204 million on 1,251 homes in the previous quarter.\n\n\"We intend to maintain the pace of our acquisition activity at roughly the same rate we had in the fourth quarter,\" CEO Stephen Schmitz said in an earnings conference call last Saturday.\n\nSome corporate rental companies are still focused on growth.\n\n\"We've been ramping up acquisitions,\" David Miller, CEO of Silver Bay Realty Trust, which owned 5,642 homes as at Dec 31, said in a conference call with investors last week.\n\n\"Looking ahead, we plan to acquire in Florida and Texas while opportunistically adding properties to our Atlanta market and perhaps other markets as well.\"\n\nWhile their acquisitions slow, Blackstone and Colony are extending their reach into the rental business by offering financing to smaller landlords. Last month, Blackstone's B2R Finance LP originated its first loan for US$5.7 million and Colony formed a joint-venture with plans to originate US$1 billion in landlord financing this year. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

The earthquake on March 11, 2011, and the subsequent tsunami wreaked such damage that the clean-up process is still not complete. The Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), which owns the plant, is struggling to find a solution for hundreds of thousands of tonnes of contaminated radioactive water.\n\nSo, to no one's surprise, large protests erupted in Taipei and in other major cities in Taiwan on the anniversary. The island is even more prone to earthquakes as it sits astride two major tectonic plates. The protesters demanded that the government immediately halt construction of a new nuclear power plant and remove nuclear waste from its three operating plants from an offshore islet and switch to clean energy.\n\nIf only a switch to renewable energy were so simple. About 20 per cent of Taiwan's power comes from its three operating nuclear power plants. A fourth nuclear power plan in Gongliao, New Taipei City, was to have been completed a decade ago, but because of political wrangling, is only now nearing completion. It is being argued that if the oldest nuclear plant were to be shut down in 2018 as planned without the fourth plant being ready to take over, rationing of electricity may become necessary. Clearly, President Ma Ying-jeou's administration is trying to keep a delicate balance on this issue. The government agrees that nuclear energy should be phased out, but gradually so as to maintain reasonable electricity rates and ensure a stable power supply.\n\nThus the new nuclear power plant would play a key role in buying more time for Taiwan to develop renewable energy sources and prepare the public and industry for the transition. After Fukushima, Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs ordered the Taiwan Power Corporation to conduct a safety review of all operating nuclear reactors, with special attention on the design, the protection of equipment and emergency response systems. Taipower now says that most of the safety enhancements have been completed. Three final alterations are scheduled for February 2015. The fourth nuclear plant would see its improvements completed one year later, in February 2016. The measures, totalling 67 of which 56 have been implemented so far, include making the new plant earthquake and tsunami-proof.\n\nEven so, the Ma administration was forced to defend nuclear energy via TV commercials. The public is being assured that the installation of fuel rods in the fourth plant would not be started before next year and only after all safety tests are completed. Taiwan often takes its environmental cues from Japan and it does not help matters that Tepco has admitted last year that at least 300 tonnes of tainted water were leaking into the sea every day. Worse, there is now the possibility that eventually the radioactive waste water would be dumped into the Pacific Ocean. Until the Fukushima problem is resolved, atomic energy will remain undesirable.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The acquisition is still subject to regulatory and shareholders' approvals, licences and further due diligence.\n\nThe dental clinic operator has been expanding in Singapore and Malaysia, largely by buying up smaller clinics that have reached the limits of their founders' ambitions or abilities, Maybank Kim Eng analysts John Cheong and Gregory Yap wrote in a note this month.\n\n\"Q&M seeks out profitable dental clinics with a proven brand name and at least two to three outlets, but which have hit the maximum capacity a sole proprietor dentist can reasonably manage.

Inflation expectations over the next five years surpassed 2 per cent to reach the highest level since May after a government report showed hourly earnings among US workers jumped more on average in February than economists forecast.\n\nThe shift in bond-market perceptions shows that some investors now expect consumer demand in the world's largest economy to be strong enough to push inflation towards the Fed's elusive 2 per cent target. Last year, investors were so convinced the persistent lack of price pressure had become entrenched that Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), posted their worst losses since they were introduced in 1997.\n\n\"Inflation is coming,\" Michael Pond, the head of global inflation-linked research at Barclays plc, one of the 22 primary dealers that trade with the Fed, said by telephone from New York. \"We're starting to break free from some of the deflationary shackles of last year. The labour market is picking up, which will cause wages to pick up.\"\n\nWhile a recovery in consumer spending would validate the Fed's move to scale back its quantitative easing after flooding the US economy with more than US$3 trillion since the financial crisis, the risk of inflation has prompted some investors to favour TIPS over Treasuries that pay a fixed rate of interest.\n\nUnlike Treasuries, whose fixed payments lose value as living costs increase, TIPS appreciate. The securities returned 2.75 per cent this year, rebounding from a 9.4 per cent plunge in 2013 and outperforming the broader market for US government debt, index data compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch show.\n\nMany investors have been overly optimistic that \"inflation will stay relatively contained and that the Fed will make a graceful exit from QE\", Zach Pandl, a senior interest-rate strategist at Columbia Management Investment Advisers, which oversees US$340 billion, said by telephone from Minneapolis. \"The economy has made a lot of progress and is accelerating.\"\n\nBuying TIPS\n\nMr Pandl, who is avoiding Treasuries as the economy may strengthen, is buying TIPS. Yields on the benchmark 10-year TIPS have fallen 0.31 percentage point this year to 0.49 per cent, while those on similar-maturity Treasuries have declined to 2.68 per cent from a more than two-year high of 3.03 per cent on Dec 31.\n\nNet purchases of the 12 ETFs that hold US inflation-linked bonds have totalled US$399 million in March, the first time combined inflows have surpassed redemptions from the funds since August 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nThe largest such ETF, the US$13 billion iShares TIPS ETF run by BlackRock Inc, is poised to snap its longest streak of withdrawals since its inception a decade ago with the biggest monthly net increase in two years.\n\nInflation expectations have picked up on signs of wage growth leading to more consumer spending. The gap between yields on five-year Treasuries and similar-maturity TIPS widened to a 10-month high on March 7, implying that consumer prices will rise an average 2.01 per cent over that span.\n\nAs recently as June, the breakeven inflation rate was 1.63 per cent, the lowest since January 2012. It was 1.95 per cent at 2pm in New York.\n\nAverage hourly earnings for all US workers climbed by nine cents, or 0.4 per cent, to US$24.31 last month, according to the Labor Department, the biggest gain since June.\n\nEmployers added more workers than estimated, a sign of the US economy starting to shake off the effects of severe winter weather that slowed growth at the start of 2014.\n\nThe Obama administration is also calling on Congress to raise the federal minimum wage by almost 40 per cent to US$10.10 an hour over the next three years, which may boost the ability of the lowest wage earners to buy more goods and services.\n\nAfter falling to a four-year low of one per cent in October, the annual inflation rate has risen for three straight months to reach 1.6 per cent in January. Economists in a Bloomberg survey anticipate the cost of living will rise 1.7 per cent this year and 2 per cent in 2015.\n\nIt's still too soon to start worrying about inflation because stagnant incomes will keep consumer spending in check, according to Jennifer Vail, head of fixed-income research of the Minneapolis-based US Bank Wealth Management, which oversees US$112 billion. Disinflation, or a slowdown in price gains, is instead the more immediate threat to the economy, she said.\n\nIncomes in the US have increased by an average 2.1 per cent over the past five years since the financial crisis, less than the 3.3 per cent growth during the previous decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nReasons to spend\n\nThe Fed's preferred gauge of inflation - the personal consumption expenditures deflator - has been below the central bank's 2 per cent goal for 21 straight months and rose just 1.2 per cent in January from a year earlier.\n\nIn the past year, the index has fallen below one per cent three times and has never exceeded 1.5 per cent. The last time inflation based on the Fed's measure was so low during an expansion was in 1998.\n\nMore jobs, higher home values and record stock prices are helping to give consumers more reasons to spend, according to Wilmer Stith, a Baltimore-based money manager at Wilmington Trust Investment Managers, a unit of Wilmington Trust, which oversees US$79 billion.\n\nHousehold wealth in the US increased by US$2.95 trillion last quarter to a record US$80.7 trillion, according to Fed data. Last month, retail sales increased for the first time in three months, the Commerce Department said, a sign that the harsh weather which curtailed spending is abating.\n\nConsumer spending is one reason why economists are anticipating faster growth. They predict the US economy will expand 2.7 per cent this year and accelerate 3 per cent in 2015, which would be the fastest in a decade. Last year, it grew 1.9 per cent.\n\nWhile the strength of the US economy has prompted economists to predict the Fed will continue to pare its bond buying by US$10 billion each month until ending its stimulus by year-end, the purchases will ultimately help to spur prices and buoy demand for inflation protection, Mr Stith said.\n\n\"All of a sudden it seems the glass is half-full instead of half-empty for TIPS,\" said Mr Stith, who has been boosting his TIPS holdings. \"There is upward pressure on wages and the Fed, while tapering, is still expanding its balance sheet, increasing the prospects of inflation.\"\n\nInflation has already emerged across financial markets, with bond yields moving inversely to stock prices for the first time since 2007, according to Jim Paulsen, Minneapolis-based chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.\n\nSigns of price pressures may also be lurking in short-term unemployment data. The jobless rate for Americans who have been out of work less than 27 weeks was just 4.2 per cent last month. That's close to the lowest since April 2008 and 0.6 percentage point below the average since 1948, Labor Department data show.\n\nThe depressed level suggests the US labour market is tightening, raising the odds that a pick-up in wages will eventually lead to faster inflation, according to Michelle Girard, chief US economist at RBS Securities in Stamford, Connecticut.\n\nFor bond investors, the latent risk means they should be buying TIPS now, said Matt Freund, chief investment officer of USAA Mutual Funds.\n\n\"Every day the potential for inflation grows,\" he said in a telephone interview from San Antonio, Texas. \"Once people are worried about inflation, it's too late.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom: survey\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/6b19ce330882da95506fbe90ec6faad570c7f1d6dba25323d76e639b42bbf165?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "More cash to splash: Inflation expectations have picked up on signs that wage growth will lead to higher consumer spending. - PHOTO: BLOOMBERG"}]}

You have given me nothing since . . . I don't think you should be treating the festival director in this way.\"\n\nProofs are preliminary versions of a publication.\n\nCriticising the way in which she operates as CEO, Mr Ong said \"... hence I am copying this letter to NAC and MCCY. I am also copying it to the press as they should understand the context of how Sifa's first season is developing.\"\n\nWhen contacted, Ms Lee said: \"I'm very respectful of artistic talents and I believe that I've given the creatives a lot of room and time for creativity and design. But I am also concerned with reader ergonomics, and how you make the design of the brochure so that things will make sense to readers. That process may not be apparent to Mr Ong, and these differences have led to a misunderstanding.\"\n\nShe added: \"This is not the first time we've had a disagreement, but we've always patched up and moved on . . . But whatever our differences, I believe the upcoming festival will be a very successful one because of the creative synergies of all those involved.\"\n\nMr Ong said that the incident was just the latest in a series of incidents and disagreements, but declined to elaborate.\n\nArts Festival Ltd was formed last May to manage and organise the revamped Sifa.\n\nMs Lee stepped down from her position as the director of the National Museum of Singapore to be the new company's chief executive. Mr Ong, Singapore's most accomplished theatre director and a Cultural Medallion winner, was named festival director for the first four editions of the festival.\n\nIn recent months, Sifa has unveiled a strong line-up of shows, including big-name artists such as Robert Wilson, Hiroshi Sugimoto, Michael Nyman, Jerome Bel and the Wooster Group; more names are set to be revealed in the coming weeks, ahead of the festival's opening in August.\n\nAt 7.30pm last night, Ms Lai, NAC's chief executive, released a statement which read: \"In the lead up to any major event, it is not uncommon for differences of opinions to emerge. Despite these differences, we acknowledge that both Keng Sen and Chor Lin have unique strengths and experiences that they bring to this partnership.\n\n\"We have spoken to both of them and we have their commitment that they will move beyond this episode and focus on their vision of a world-class festival.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is a welcome move that amounts to another step - albeit a small one - in China's long journey of financial reform. However, there will, and should, be more to come.\n\nThe widening of the band within which the Chinese currency is permitted to move was well anticipated. In a statement on February, the PBOC had indicated that one of its policy goals was an \"orderly\" widening of the yuan's trading band. Currency markets responded by sending the yuan lower against the US dollar. This is no bad thing: A weakening of the yuan drives home the point that China's currency is not a one-way bet. Some people had assumed it could only go up, which had led to surging capital inflows, both in terms of hot money and foreign direct investment. These in turn added to the credit bubble in China, which the PBOC is trying hard to curb. Making the yuan a two-way bet is one way to do this. A weaker yuan - which is the likely short-term impact of a wider band - could also benefit the economy in other ways. It could raise inflation a notch, which would be good for consumer spending, which the Chinese government is trying to encourage. It would also help boost exports. Although the PBOC as well as most analysts suggest, correctly, that this was not a motive in the decision to widen the band, it could be a useful side-effect. China's growth is slowing. Many analysts forecast that even the 7.5 per cent GDP (gross domestic product) growth target for this year will be hard to meet. Investment growth is also slowing, and consumer spending will be slow to take off. In these circumstances, any help China can get from exports would be welcome. Moreover, with its biggest markets, the United States and the European Union, now in recovery mode, this is not a bad time for China to have a more competitive currency.\n\nThe PBOC could, however, have been more aggressive in widening the band, going to at least 2.5 per cent on either side. While the urge to be cautious is understandable, it should be noted that this is not the first time the yuan's trading band has been widened. It also happened in April 2012 when it was widened from 0.5 per cent to one per cent on either side of the parity rate. That did not create any instability. Hopefully, the band will be further widened from here, which would make the yuan a more flexible currency and even less of a one-way bet - albeit most analysts project that in the long run it will strengthen against the US dollar. However in the long run, another reform that the PBOC should consider is a currency that is not pegged to the greenback, not even via a soft peg; as China trades with multiple countries, it should consider pegging its currency to a trade-weighted basket, which would better reflect its true value.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Columns\n\nAnother moon landing will take more than rocket science\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nSingapore\u2019s new grant signals the need to adapt to tariffs, not just ride them out\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nEroding US exceptionalism will impact world economy\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nBye-bye America First?\n\nJul 15, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n4\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\n5\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal", "images": []}

Under the \"stop-the-clock\" proposal, only internal EU flights are charged for emissions.\n\nMatthias Groote, environment committee chairman in the European Parliament, said by phone there was still no majority either way in the committee on the issue.\n\nThe centre-right European People's Party (EPP), the biggest grouping in the Parliament, is broadly in favour of the extension, but liberal ALDE member Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy said by phone he was encouraging his members to vote against the deal.\n\nMr Groote said there was still opposition to the deal among some members of his Socialist Party, while the Greens, the European Parliament's fourth-biggest group, have already said they would oppose the proposal.\n\nThe European Union in 2012 started charging all airlines that use EU airports for all of their emissions.\n\nBut after fierce opposition from China and the US, it suspended the law to give the UN's global aviation body, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), more time to craft a global measure to regulate airlines' rising output of heat-trapping gases.\n\nLast October, the roughly 190 nations at ICAO agreed to design a global scheme by 2016, which would not take effect until 2020, and rejected letting Europe apply its own plan to foreign carriers in the meantime.\n\nMr Gerbrandy said he was seeking a compromise that would mean international airlines would have to pay for their emissions once they entered European airspace, in line with a proposal put forward by the Commission.\n\n\"For me this (law) goes much further than aviation and the climate. It is about the position of the EU in the world,\" he said.\n\nEnvironmental campaigners also say the Parliament should hold out for an airspace approach.\n\n\"The International Civil Aviation Organization recognises that regulating emissions in states' airspace is legal,\" Bill Hemmings, aviation manager at campaign group Transport & Environment, said. \"This is what the Parliament should ensure happens now.\" - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

This has proved well in the second half of 2013. Depending on how well the tools will be applied by the industry, going forward this may develop to improve earnings.\"\n\nChris Faulkner, CEO of Breitling Energy in the US, agrees that dry bulk is the sub-sector with the most potential within the maritime industry. \"Dry bulk seaborne shipping is looking really strong, with Barclays Research forecasting 5.8 per cent growth in 2014 versus a 5.3 per cent increase in the global merchant fleet. Growth in commodity cargoes like iron ore and coal will be a driver in the dry bulk market, as countries in South-east Asia and Africa push to build out infrastructure.\"\n\nOthers feel that fortunes of the dry bulk market hinge heavily on the ability of China and India to drive it forward.\n\n\"India and China put together may lead the recovery of dry bulk market,\" said Jitesh Jaipuriyar, chief operating officer of Emerald Maritime.\n\nMr Sand concurred, saying: \"Not surprisingly I guess, Bimco continues to see China as the main driver of the dry bulk market.\"\n\nBut China and India, as the bright sparks of the maritime sector, are expected to result in a positive impact on not just the dry bulk segment, but others too.\n\nMr Faulkner said: \"China's shipping market has great potential because of its determination to stimulate exports and expand trade through new free trade agreements with Indonesia, Iceland and Switzerland and its push to diversify crude oil supplies. In addition to strong trade between China and the US, with US manufacturing on the rebound, we'll also see a lot of regional trade between China, South-east Asia and South America.\"\n\nCapt Jaipuriyar said: \"I personally feel upbeat about both (China and India) and more so about India in the next five years. The fragile five - India, Indonesia, Brazil, Turkey and South Africa - are going through elections and a stable regime can bring lots of positive change.\"\n\nThe spillover effect on other segments beyond dry bulk shipping is highly probable. Capt Jaipuriyar said that the growing scarcity of oil and related resources would prompt India and China, in general, and India in particular, to intensity their oil exploration projects.\n\n\"Vietnam has joined hands too and has offered seven oil blocks to India in the South China Sea. In the meantime, the Middle East, in general, and Iraq in particular, are in the process of renaissance,\" he added.\n\nThese factors combined may make the offshore & marine segment another potential area to look out for within the maritime industry, he said.\n\nMr Faulkner pointed instead in the direction of container and crude shipping, which may be buoyed by increased demand from the two large Asian economies.\n\n\"The very large crude carrier market has had a rough time, but it's going to get better as companies seek to lower costs and countries like China and India push to increase their strategic petroleum reserves. China is looking to diversify its crude oil supplies, which could mean longer sea voyages and higher rates for tanker owners for routes to West Africa and South America.\n\n\"Overall, it looks like the container segment has the most promise this year, with demand for global containers set to grow 4-6 per cent.\"\n\nAn unlikely area flagged by industry players as a sector that would receive more attention is carbon efficiency. But whether it becomes an opportunity or a challenge remains to be seen.\n\nCapt Jaipuriyar said: \"In spite of the fact that shipping may be perceived as the world's most carbon-efficient mode of transporting goods, the idea of 'carbon trading' is in (an) infancy (stage). While ships' engine manufacturers may be trying to leverage on technology to respond to concerns of high carbon dioxide emissions and making ships more fuel-efficient, I see an abundant opportunity in creating a 'market-based mechanism' to record, trade and purchase carbon offsets and utilise money elsewhere to sustain growth.\"\n\nHe added that this can further give rise to \"carbon derivatives\" to be traded subsequently.\n\nMr Faulkner, on the other hand, described carbon dioxide emissions from the shipping industry as the greatest challenge facing the maritime sector.\n\nHe revealed that although the sector accounts for some 3 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions, and this seems relatively low, it is consistently growing while other sectors' emissions are slowly decreasing. Moreover, it should be noted that this sector is a heavy polluter because impulsion technology and used fuels are not subject to environmental regulations, and the sector has a lack of incentives for emissions reduction.\n\n\"If companies don't take any precautions for it, in a decade, shipping will be the biggest single emitter of air pollution even surpassing the emissions from all land-based sources together,\" he warned. \"Companies' efforts should be directed in finding technologies and methods that are the most efficient to help (them) reduce energy use in the most cost-efficient way possible. There is one way to reduce energy - by simply lowering speed. Shipowners and operators can consider this in order to decrease operating costs arising from fuel expenses.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its organisers told The Business Times that an estimated $20 million will come from visitors' hotel room nights and shopping, as well as operating costs, wages and berthing fees for the boats.\n\nAmong the yacht brands exhibiting for the first time are Alloy Yachts, L\u00fcrssen, Edmiston & Company, Fraser Yachts, Perini Navi/Picchiotti, Philippe Briand, Porto Montenegro, Rossinavi Yachts, Sunreef Yachts, Y.CO and Yacht Zoo, which join the other brands that have made an appearance at SYS from its very start.\n\nAndy Treadwell, managing director of organiser Singapore Yacht Events, said this year's surge in interest is testament to the global yachting industry's recognition of Asia as an important emerging market.\n\n\"The show has grown tremendously over the four years since we started, practically doubling in size at each edition. A significant number of boats have been sold - especially last year,\" he said.\n\nThe show's dramatic growth reflects Singapore's third-place global ranking for number of resident multi-millionaires, said a 2013 WealthInsight report; other reports name the Republic as the Asian wealth-management epicentre, with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) stating that the island-state has assets worth $1.4 trillion under management with 500 licensed players.\n\nThe appetite for luxury goods has thus grown in tandem with this.\n\nArthur Tay, the executive chairman of ONE\u00b015 Marina Club, said: \"We are seeing a real growth in the yachting and boating industry here as a result of the yacht show team's efforts over the past four years.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is almost like a pilot's checklist,\" said a senior captain from an Asian carrier with experience of jets, including the Boeing 777.\n\nThe radio call does not prove that it was the co-pilot who turned off the transponder. Pilots say that the usual practice is that the pilot not in control of the plane talks on the radio.\n\nPolice have searched the premises of both the captain and co-pilot, and are checking the backgrounds of all passengers.\n\nBut whoever turned the transponder to \"off\" did so at a vulnerable point between two airspace sectors when Malaysian and Vietnamese controllers could easily assume the airplane was each others' responsibility.\n\n\"The predictable effect was to delay the raising of the alarm by either party,\" David Learmount, operations and safety editor at Flight International, wrote in an industry blog.\n\nThat mirrors delays in noticing that something was wrong when an Air France jet disappeared over the Atlantic in 2009 with 228 people on board, a gap blamed on confusion between controllers.\n\nYet whereas the Rio-Paris disaster was later traced to pilot error, the suspected kidnapping of MH370's passengers and crew was carried out with either skill or bizarre coincidences.\n\nWhether or not pilots knew it, the jet was just then in a technically obscure sweet spot, according to a top radar expert.\n\nAir traffic controllers use secondary radar which works by talking to the transponder. Some air traffic control systems also blend in some primary radar, which uses a simple echo.\n\nBut primary radar signals fade faster than secondary ones, meaning that even a residual blip would have vanished for controllers; and even military radar may have found it difficult to identify the B777 from other ghostly blips, said radar expert Hans Weber. \"Turning off the transponder indicates this person was highly trained,\" said Mr Weber, of consultancy TECOP International.\n\nThe overnight flight to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur is packed year-round with business people, Chinese tourists and students, attracted in part by code-sharing deals, regular travellers say.\n\nThe lockdown of MH370 may have begun as early as 40 minutes into the flight at a point when meals are being hurriedly served in time to get trays cleared and lights dimmed for the night. \"It was a red-eye flight. Most people - the passengers and the crew - just want to rest,\" a Malaysia Airlines stewardess said. \"Unless there was a reason to panic, if someone had taken control of the aircraft, they would not have noticed anything.\"\n\nInvestigators believe that at some point between 1.07 am and 1.37 am, someone switched off another system called ACARS designed to transmit maintenance data back to the ground.\n\nThe explanation of the timing has shifted after Malaysian officials initially said that it was turned off before the pilot last spoke at 1.19 am. But it could have been done later as well, although before 1.37 am, when the system was to make another transmission, which it did not.\n\nBy itself, switching off ACARS was unusual but would not necessarily have raised alarms at the airline, and the passengers would not have known something was amiss, said some of the six pilots contacted by Reuters, none of whom agreed to be named. \"Occasionally, there are gaps in the communications systems, and the guys in ground operations may not think much of it initially. It would be a while before they try to find out what was wrong,\" said a captain with an Asian carrier.\n\nCutting the datalink would not have been easy. Instructions are not in the Flight Crew Operating Manual, one pilot said.\n\nCircuit-breakers used to disable the system are in a bay reached through a hatch in the floor next to the lefthand front exit, close to a galley used to prepare meals. Most pilots said that it would be impossible to turn off ACARS from inside the cockpit, although two people did not rule it out. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

But like the US and Russia, Romeo and Juliet or cream of bak kut teh and chorizo, attempts to unite can be pretty painful. Especially with the latter, when restaurants which venture beyond tried and true classics into silly dish territory make modern Chinese cuisine more of a threat than a promise.\n\nSuch is the apprehension that accompanies a visit to Royal Pavilion - a self-styled modern Cantonese eatery at the blink-and-you-miss-it Park Regis Singapore in Merchant Road. It's a four star hotel recently bought over by a Chinese tycoon, which may explain the conversion of the lobby coffee house into a discreet, upscale eatery that seems more five star than its premises implies.\n\nAny modernist leanings here are kept under tight control by head chef Chung Ho Shi, whose confident cooking reflects his previous tenure at the helm of Golden Peony in the Conrad Centennial Singapore - one of the better hotel Chinese restaurants in town. Although he offers vaguely funky creations like coffee-infused smoked salmon, grilled siew mai on skewers and foie gras in every conceivable form from pan-fried lobes to sauce, he keeps the flavour profiles within an acceptable boundary.\n\nSome of his twists are even a nice change from the conventional, like mixing preserved Chinese vegetable mei cai into the filling of char siew pau ($4.50), to add a slight savouriness and texture to the generally sweet barbecued pork mixture. We're undecided about the siew mai skewer ($5) with an oily sheen on the surface of the otherwise bouncy grilled dumplings topped with tobiko, although we like the slightly crispy skin.\n\nWhat we really like is the fried carrot cake ($8.80) cubes tossed in the chef's home made XO-like sauce made with fried silver fish, dried prawns and chilli which goes so well with the wok hei-infused firm yet soft radish cake. It could do with more sauce so you can get enough of it with each mouthful of carrot cake. We end up asking for more and are rewarded with a little dish of the precious condiment all to ourselves.\n\nChef Chung dabbles a little in Western plating with his foie gras combination plate ($22) comprising pan-seared liver on a slice of grilled pineapple, scallop in a sweet brown sauce and deep-fried prawn, each element well-executed with a nice medley of sweet, rich and savoury flavours plus extra crunch. Considering that each could have been a dish on its own, there was no one-upsmanship involved, with each getting its share of the limelight.\n\nAnother good display of balance can be found in the deep-fried Hokkaido scallop in Thai sauce ($16.80), which sits on a bed of salad sprinkled with julienned green apple to mimic the sourness of Thai salads, moistened in a neither too sweet nor too tart dressing.\n\nChef Chung is also a deft hand at smoking, turning out deliciously fragrant crispy duck smoked in lychee wood ($35 for half/$68 whole) with near Peking duck-crisp skin and thick chunks of slightly lean meat. The ducks are from Malaysia and aren't as juicy or fat as their China counterparts which can't seem to waddle fast enough to sneak past our immigration check points. But Chef Chung makes do and does a commendable job of it. We like the bird better than the grilled pork rib wrapped in bacon ($10 a piece) which pretty much tastes the way it's described.\n\nEnd your meal with a comforting bowl of fragrant piping hot almond cream with bits of egg white and sign off on a dependable, enjoyable meal that is priced reasonably enough for regular visits. Incidentally, Royal Pavilion marks Chef Chung's switch to chef-owner status, along with Taste Paradise alumnus Ken Ang, who mans the front of house.

But while banks and other financial institutions have been deleveraging, corporates as well as governments have been piling up more debt rapidly.\n\nThe huge surge in public and corporate debt is occurring at a time of very low inflation, making the real burden of the debt much greater than it would be in an inflationary environment and some corporates could find it difficult in servicing their debt in future, the IIF warned.\n\nAccording to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the IIF said in its latest Capital Markets Monitor that \"total global debt (non-financial debt from both public and private sectors) has risen by 40 per cent since 2007 to exceed US$100 trillion - over 135 per cent of world GDP\".\n\nWhile the sharp increase in public-sector debt in mature economies accounts for the bulk of this increase, the build-up in non-financial corporate sector indebtedness has been also remarkable, noted the IIF. \"Non-financial corporate debt now stands at over 90 per cent of GDP on average across mature economies, with an even more dramatic increase to over 80 per cent of GDP in emerging economies.\"\n\nThe emerging market corporate sector has seen its debt load rise rapidly, from just over 55 per cent of GDP in 2007 to around 80 per cent at present, comparable to the US level of corporate debt.\n\nSome countries have seen their corporate debt/GDP ratios go well past 100 per cent. The IIF report singled out especially China, which it said \"now has the highest corporate debt to GDP ratio in the world and near 145 per cent. Hungary and South Korea follow suit with over 120 per cent and 110 per cent respectively.\n\n\"Such a high debt load renders many emerging market corporations ill-equipped to deal with the challenges looming ahead: slowing trend growth rates and rising interest rates following (US Federal Reserve) tapering,\" noted the IIF, which is headed by former senior US Treasury official Tim Adams.\n\n\"These headwinds make it more difficult for many emerging market corporations to regain profitability given the erosion in their profit margins-earnings per share. Moreover, the rapid pace of debt build-up means there is potential for credit deterioration when the operating environment gets difficult.\"\n\nEchoing concerns expressed at the time of the 1997 Asian crisis, the IIF noted that \"many emerging market corporations have raised substantial amounts of debt denominated in hard currencies. For example, corporations in China are estimated to have more than US$800 billion in dollar-denominated debt.\"\n\nEven after taking account of recent equity market rallies, \"the global economy looks to have been more leveraged than before the crisis, in terms of an increase in the overall debt to equity ratio\", the IIF added.\n\nFor many emerging market corporate borrowers, the weakening of their currencies in the past year in foreign exchange markets has made their debt servicing more onerous.\n\n\"As a result, some highly indebted emerging market firms may find it increasingly difficult to service or refinance their debt. Emerging market corporations (in total) are faced with some US$1.68 trillion of maturing debt in 2014-18.\n\n\"Of this, US$1.2 trillion is in local currencies and the remainder in hard currencies. A further rise in borrowing costs would exacerbate the problem (as) both hard and local-currency emerging market borrowing costs are vulnerable to a renewed increase, either as US Treasury yields rise or as a result of broader tensions in some emerging markets.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For the past nine years, each business day at 9 in the morning, government workers in the blandly named Building No 30 in Shanghai's Pudong district have published a benchmark number that tells the world what their country's currency will be worth that day, when compared with the US dollar.\n\nMore often than not, the staff of the China Foreign Exchange Trade System has assigned a value to the currency, the renminbi, slightly stronger than it had finished the previous day. Thanks to the guiding hand of the Chinese state, the renminbi today is about 25 per cent stronger than it was in July 2005, when China scrapped the currency's fixed peg to the US dollar in favour of a steady, crawling appreciation.\n\nBut recent developments suggest such strengthening is no longer the certainty it once appeared to be, and Beijing is taking pains to show that China's currency is not just a one-way bet. This year, the renminbi has reversed course, weakening 1.6 per cent against the US dollar. And on Saturday, the central bank, the People's Bank of China, said that beginning Monday, it would allow the currency to climb or fall as much as 2 per cent per day against the US dollar, compared with one per cent previously.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Wealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom: survey\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

For instance, at this year's Australian Open, sensor data collected from speed guns and those positioned around the tennis court were used to gain insights on anything from first serve accuracy to the placement of serves within the playing area, Mr Bilafer shared.\n\n\"I spoke to Serena Williams' coach during the competition and he shared how they were using the information to focus on first-serve placements, which is an integral part of how she plays,\" the executive shared.\n\nSAP's analytics capabilities were also on show during the recently concluded first-leg of the Extreme Sailing Series held in Singapore. Information collected from the race catamarans, such as geospatial and GPS (global positioning system) data, were put together to help illustrate what's happening during each race, and for the crews to evaluate their performance after each day's races, he shared.\n\nStefan Lacher, head of technology for SAP Sponsorships, who was in town for the Extreme Sailing Series, said that IT has helped make the competition more engaging for spectators.\n\nWith the analytics tools in place, spectators are able to know who won a particular leg of the competition as soon as the last race concluded. Previously, race officials had to manually tally and calculate each team's scores, and this left spectators in the dark as to who clinched the race and competition, he shared.\n\nWhile the use of analytics in sports is gaining traction on a global level, Mr Bilafer admitted that generating awareness and interest in the region will prove challenging since there isn't a single sport that stands out as a fan favourite across Asia.\n\nFootball may come close in terms of popularity, but it is a low-scoring sport with a small set of statistical data to mine. Sports such as cricket and baseball, on the other hand, generate and collect a lot of data, which makes it easier for analysis, but they are not as popular across the population, he noted.\n\nThis is why, for this year and beyond, SAP will be targeting large-scale sporting events such as the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, the quadrennial Asian Games, as well as certain sports associations to gain a foothold in the industry here, the executive revealed.\n\nIts latest deal with Indian cricket club The Kolkata Knight Riders last month is indicative of the software giant's strategy. SAP Labs India and the India Premier League (IPL) club agreed to develop a statistical analysis tool, named SAP Auction Analytics, to better assist the club to recruit players during the upcoming season's player auction.\n\n\"We constantly explore new ways and technologies to provide our players and management with the best set of tools to compete. SAP, as a leader in providing innovative software solutions, is an ideal partner to equip us with technology that can aid in effective decision-making,\" said Venky Mysore, CEO of The Kolkata Knight Riders, in a statement.\n\nMr Bilafer is confident more will come onboard and explore opportunities to harness its real-time analytics in the area of sports in Asia; and the onus is on SAP's sports and entertainment team to pick the right team in the right league to partner with.\n\nThe company could not provide Asia-Pacific figures, but it estimates the use of technology in the sports industry globally in terms of fan engagement, team performance and venue management currently stands at more than 2 billion euros (S$3.52 billion).\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However, many companies in Asia have yet to cotton on to the microblogging service's business benefits since they don't experiment with the platform and learn from mistakes, says one Twitter executive.\n\nParminder Singh, Twitter's MD for South-east Asia, India and MENA (Middle East and North Africa), told BizIT recently that the awareness and intent to use the microblogging service by companies in the Asian markets he is in charge of is \"very strong\". The challenge is helping them understand how to better use Twitter to engage and meet their customers' needs, he noted.\n\nHe agreed that some companies might have put off joining the platform for fear of consumer backlash should they commit a misstep when engaging people online. To this, he said: \"Twitter users love brands that are authentic, and negative news are not necessarily bad (for the company).\"\n\nFor instance, when US Cellular suffered a two-day outage, customers went on Twitter to vent their frustrations. But because the telco interacted with customers with humour and in real time, people got to see the brand in all its vulnerabilities and this \"humanised\" the company. In the end, the company saw its brand loyalty surge because of the incident, Mr Singh noted.\n\nGiven the nature of Twitter users, he urged companies in Singapore and around the region not to worry about making mistakes, but to learn to harness the platform effectively.\n\nTo do so, though, means Mr Singh and his team will need to help companies identify the cultural climate they are operating out of, and how to utilise Twitter as a real-time interaction tool to drive brand loyalty and engagement.\n\nLearning these tools offers great business potential, he added. According to internal studies, Twitter found that an engaged user is 30 per cent more likely to view the brand favourably than a non-engaged one. More importantly, an engaged user is 53 per cent more likely to show intent to purchase from the brand as opposed to the non-engaged user, he noted.\n\nTwitter is banking on Asia-Pacific companies to heed Mr Singh's call to action. In the first quarterly financial report filed by the social networking company since its IPO last November, Forbes reported that the company only managed to squeeze 27 per cent revenue from international users, or those outside of the US.\n\nMr Singh, however, suggested another way of viewing the numbers. He said international advertising revenue amounted to US$66 million of the overall US$220 million raked in for the year, representing a 200 per cent year-on-year increase.\n\nBeyond monetisation issues, a Japan Times report last November highlighted that previously high-growth markets Japan and South Korea are seeing a slowdown. It cited the rise of alternative mediums such as mobile messaging services KakaoTalk and Line as one key reason for the decline.\n\nEven for existing accounts, the report noted that many have become dormant. Citing findings from Seoul-based analytics company CYRAM, Japan Times estimated that there are seven million Twitter users in South Korea, for example, but only one million of them send more than one tweet a month.\n\nResponding to the article, Dickson Seow, Asia-Pacific head of communications at Twitter, said that Japan remains a \"top 3 market\" for the company, is \"still growing\", and is \"one of its best-performing markets worldwide\".\n\nSouth Korea, too, saw a spike of 10 per cent in user engagement during the recently-concluded Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, and this is indicative of how the platform is thriving in the market, Mr Seow added.\n\nThere is room for growth in other Asian markets too. According to figures from local tech news site Techgoondu, there are 2.56 million Twitter users here as of June 2013. This translates to a 49.4 per cent penetration rate. In comparison, Facebook has 3.22 million users, a 62.2 per cent penetration rate, it revealed.\n\nThis is why one of Mr Singh's main focuses for now is to build up the local team, which was established in January 2013. There is a need to increase the number of people on the ground to bring the Twitter business proposition to companies here and in the region, given that Singapore is the regional hub for many organisations' sales and marketing decision-making teams, he said.\n\nThe company is actively hiring to add to the existing pool of 20 employees, he said, but declined to state how many he plans to recruit. A look at its recruitment board showed 16 positions on offer for its Singapore office at the time of publication.\n\n\"We want to ensure advertisers' demand and interests are matched by our resources,\" he said, adding that his team is augmented by ad sales partner Komli Media, which sells Twitter's Promoted Tweet, Promoted Accounts and Promoted Trends products to Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines.\n\nIn the region, Twitter has a presence in Japan, Australia and South Korea besides the markets Mr Singh is in charge of.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It also said SIA Cargo has \"vigorously defended\" the class action since it commenced.\n\nThe settlement is subject to the approval of Australia's Federal Court.\n\nIn the third quarter ended Dec 31, 2013, SIA's results had been partially impacted by exceptional items stemming from the provision for penalties incurred by SIA Cargo, which had reached a settlement for $78.3 million under a United States Air Cargo class action.\n\nSeparately, SIA Cargo was also fined $2.3 million by the Swiss Competition Commission for a Swiss air cargo competition law case.\n\nSIA reported a net Q3 profit of $50.1 million, down 65 per cent year-on-year while revenue was nearly flat at $3.87 billion.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/diesel-delights", "site_title": "Diesel delights", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nDiesel delights\n\nWith more diesel models coming on the market, Samuel Ee drives a hatchback, sedan and van with turbodiesel engines\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Mar 14, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nONE interesting response to the re-classification of COE Category A has been the proliferation of turbodiesels. The diesel engine typically offers low power with high torque, making it ideal for meeting the government's engine output limit of 97 kW or 130 hp for cars below 1,600 cc.\n\nOne of these models is the Volvo V40 Cross Country D2. The Volvo V40 Cross Country is already familiar here in T4 trim, with a 1.6-litre turbocharged petrol engine with 180 hp and 240 Nm.\n\nThe D2 version, however, has a 1.6-litre four-cylinder turbodiesel with 115 hp. But it is able to muster up an eye-popping 270 Nm of torque to send to the front wheels through the six-speed Powershift dual-clutch transmission.\n\nBut from the zero to 100 kmh acceleration time of 12.1 seconds, it is clear that the V40 D2 isn't as brisk as the V40 T4 (8.5 seconds). Where the D2's beefy torque plays a critical role is in in-gear acceleration, like when you're cruising and suddenly decide to overtake. Floor the D2's throttle and the diesel impresses with its strength.\n\nAt the same time, another diesel attribute is its excellent mileage. Even with all that oomph, Volvo claims the V40 D2 requires only 4.1 km per 100 km under the combined cycle, or an amazing 24.4 km per litre. So with its 52-litre fuel tank, technically that means it is possible to drive from Singapore to Penang and back without refuelling - perfect for those concerned about the quality of diesel fuel across the Causeway.\n\nFor all its advantages, the V40 D2 does have its quirks. For one, there is the usual diesel clatter, although this is not obvious from inside the car with the windows up. Another is that under hard acceleration from stationary, the dual-clutch automatic transmission hesitates slightly with each gear change, resulting in a slight jerkiness, especially in Sport mode. It is smoother if the twin-clutch gearbox is shifted manually using the gear lever.\n\nAnother is that while the compact five-door hatchback is sleek and stylish, there are aspects which require updating, such as the small centre monitor with its limited display info, and the (three) windshield washer nozzles on the bonnet.\n\nBut otherwise, the V40 Cross Country D2 is a cool hatch. The Cross Country rides 40 mm higher than a standard V40, with sportier overtones such as contrasting front and rear bumpers and vertical daytime running lights.

For the week the index was down 63 points or 2 per cent.\n\nOn the home front, the big news was Temasek Holdings' takeover bid for Olam International's shares at $2.23 per share. Olam's price had shot up 56 cents or about 40 per cent since early February to a pre-suspension level of $1.995 on Wednesday, just before the announcement of Temasek's offer.\n\nOCBC Investment Research said of the Temasek offer that $2.23 is above its $1.76 fair value estimate for Olam. \"For shareholders who have already enjoyed strong gains or are medium-term shareholders, they can consider taking up the offer,\" said the broker.\n\nTurnover yesterday was just over two billion units worth $1.2 billion, pretty much in line with the low daily averages of late that have left retail dealers wondering about their long-term future. A Bloomberg story mid-week about an impending exodus of retail brokers from the industry did little to lift spirits.\n\nOther than a push on Olam, the activity in other blue chips was muted. The banks were weak while China concerns played on commodity prices and in turn affected commodity counters such as Noble and Wilmar.\n\nAmong penny stocks, there was activity in Johor property play Albedo and China water treatment firms like HanKore, SIIC Environment and United Envirotech. In yesterday's session, offshore marine plays such as Mirach Energy and Charisma Energy came to life in high volume.\n\nChina's slowdown was the subject of several reports during the week. Bank of America-Merrill Lynch (BoA-ML), for instance, in its March 13 China Economic Watch titled \"China slowed in Jan-Feb, but let's look past the slowdown\", noted the drops in industrial production and retail sales but added that the scope for more weakness in March is limited. \"Despite the slowdown in Jan-Feb, we don't think it could be described as a hard landing, even though some sectors might have seen a slump in growth rates,\" said BoA-ML.\n\n\"We should note that data in the first two months is usually relatively volatile. And Beijing has room to adjust policies in the year beginning.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley, on the other hand, said that even after considering any potential Chinese New Year distortion effect, the weakening across the board still appears surprising, given 2013's low base.\n\n\"Against the backdrop of weaker CNY exchange rate and metal commodity prices lately, we believe concerns about ma-cro instability will likely weigh on market sentiment in the near term,\" said MS in its March 13 China Economics report \"More evidence of growth deceleration starting to build\".\n\nIt said its growth forecasts had remained below-consensus and it maintains its long-held view that growth will weaken in H1 2014, hampered by tighter financial conditions, lukewarm external demand and policy focus on long-term adjustments.\n\nMacquarie Warrants (MW) in its daily notes yesterday said Macquarie Equities Research (MER) reiterates its macro projection of a V-shaped recovery for China in 2014.\n\n\"Jan-Feb activity data are in line with their contrarian call at that time that GDP growth will slow in 1Q14, in spite of the low comparison base. Looking forward, growth could continue to slide in 2Q14, as the ongoing destocking and property down-cycle would continue to weigh on the economy. With growth likely falling below 7 per cent in 2Q14, MER believes Beijing will then ease policy in a more aggressive way and the economy could turn around in 3Q14.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

At the same time, St James will undertake a 50-to-one share consolidation.\n\nUpon completion, St James will move on to the second phase of the transaction - that is a share swop for the remaining units of PCRT at 70 cents apiece in exchange for new shares. The offer price for PCRT is at a 27.3 per cent premium to its last traded price.\n\nThe resulting new entity will be renamed \"Perennial Real Estate Holdings Limited (PREHL)\" with a planned transfer from the Catalist to the mainboard.\n\nAccording to St James' offer document, the proposed acquisition of target assets at a 25 per cent discount to their book value will raise its consolidated NTA per share from 1.9 Singapore cents to 127.16 cents and earnings per share from a loss of 1.21 cents to a profit of 4.89 cents.\n\nPREH president and vice-chairman Pua Seck Guan, slated to be the CEO of the new PREHL, pointed out that existing unit holders of PCRT will end up holding shares of a larger company with a property portfolio consisting of assets in China and Singapore.\n\nThe 14 Chinese assets include the iconic Beijing Tongzhou Integrated development and large-scale integrated developments adjacent and connected to high-speed rail stations in Xian and Chengdu. The Singapore portfolio will include Chijmes, Capitol Development and TripleOne Somerset.\n\nAs a business trust, PCRT was bound by trust deed to invest in only assets in China and in the retail segment. But the new PREHL will not have restrictions on geographies and asset classes. \"This will allow us to tap the debt capital markets better,\" Mr Pua said. The new PREHL will seek out more opportunities in China, Singapore and even Myanmar with a focus on mixed development projects.\n\n\"The strategy to invest in integrated development projects, where some parts can be held for yield and other parts sold for trading profit, is an ideal capital efficient model, and together with the progressive completion of construction of development projects, are expected to provide shareholders with net asset value growth potential,\" Mr Pua said.\n\nWhen asked about how PREHL will pit against the other big Singapore property players, Mr Pua told reporters that \"the market is big enough for us\" while the company has the advantage of being \"nimble\".\n\nHe said that the new PREHL can leverage on the business network and experience of its major shareholders, Kuok Khoon Hong, who is also chairman and CEO of Wilmar International and Ron Sim, who is the founder and CEO of OSIM International. Mr Kuok is currently a major shareholder of PREH while Mr Sim is a significant investor in a number of assets managed by PREH.\n\nDennis Foo, CEO of St James, said yesterday that the proposed transactions \"will enable St James to restructure and distribute its existing hospitality and entertainment business to the company's shareholders\". Mr Foo will continue to manage the business as a separately incorporated company.\n\nControlling shareholders of St James - Dennon Entertainment, EK Capital and FJ Benjamin Concepts Pte Ltd - that together own 57 per cent have given an irrevocable undertaking to vote in favour of the relevant resolutions at the upcoming shareholders' meeting.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Singapore investor is leading a group which has offered to buy the 48 per cent of the commodity trader it doesn't already own at a valuation of US$4.3 billion. The buyout should help to shield Olam from sceptical short sellers - and remove any doubts over its creditworthiness.\n\nIt's not the first time Temasek has come to Olam's aid. In December 2012, the group underwrote a US$712 million convertible bond issue designed to see off short sellers like Muddy Waters, which had challenged Olam's accounting. Yet despite Temasek's support, and a subsequent strategy overhaul designed to improve cash generation, Olam's valuation has lagged those of its listed peers.\n\nFor that reason, the consortium's S$2.23-a-share cash bid should find plenty of takers. The offer is only an 11.8 per cent premium to Olam's most recent closing price, and comes after near-40 per cent rally in recent months. But it's a price shareholders have not seen since the summer of 2012, when analysts started raising doubts about the company's soundness. Besides, there's no prospect of a rival bid.\n\nThe consortium says it wants to keep Olam's listing. But if it ends up with over 90 per cent of the shares, the stock exchange could cancel Olam's listing.\n\nThe most immediate beneficiary of the buyout is Olam's creditworthiness. Despite Temasek's minority shareholding, the company has faced persistent queries about its debt load. That's particularly damaging for a trading house like Olam, which relies on the confidence of its counterparties. In future, creditors will view Olam as an extension of its sovereign parent. Short sellers may insist that Olam would have been in trouble without Temasek's support. But that is precisely the point. By questioning Olam's accounting, Muddy Waters also challenged the authority of one of the world's largest investors. With assets of S$215 billion, Temasek's protective embrace is sufficient to fend off even the most determined attack. That's a lesson short sellers will need to bear in mind when choosing future targets.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

All share a common goal - to pocket some quick, hassle free cash for the short term.\n\n\"Some people discover that they haven't brought enough money with them to get supplies next door, so they walk in to our shop and pawn the items they are wearing for cash,\" says ValueMax executive director and Mr Yeah's daughter, Yeah Lee Ching, in an interview with The Business Times.\n\nTherein lies the draw of pawnshops - in just 10 minutes, you get cash in hand and if the pawn loan exceeds $200, the need for a purchase receipt or guarantor may hold you up just a tad longer.\n\nIt's the wealthy - Singapore has one of the highest number of super rich in the world - whom ValueMax is now targeting to grow its business, which chalked up $350 million in sales last year.\n\nTo plump up its pledge book, the pawnbroker is looking at opening a flagship store in the central business district later in the year. It promises more privacy, better service and possibly, more swank, to draw in the moneyed lot.\n\n\"It's not true that pawnbrokers are a poor man's bank. Many of our clients have valuable assets like gold or Rolex watches. They are asset rich but cash poor,\" she says.\n\nOne thing that could work in favour of pawnbrokers such as ValueMax is the decision by the Monetary Authority of Singapore in June last year to cap total borrowings at 60 per cent of qualifying income, or what is referred to as the total debt servicing ratio. The measure, aimed at reining in rising household debt, has made it tough for the asset-blessed, but unemployed to borrow from banks, says an analyst. Pawning their assets for some big bucks could be an option.\n\nBut Ms Yeah feels that ValueMax has a trump card: Its experienced team of 17 chief appraisers - the most important link in the business as they set the value a pledged asset can fetch. \"If someone is very sick, they don't go to a GP (general practitioner) - they see a specialist. So, if you have a family heirloom, you'd choose a specialist like a chief appraiser. We can confidently value the asset as opposed to doing so conservatively,\" says Ms Yeah.\n\nIt helps too that ValueMax is listed. \"Being a listed entity instils more confidence among customers,\" says the analyst.\n\nThe Singapore Exchange has seen a pawn rush in recent years. In mid-2012, Singapore's largest pawnbroking chain with 31 stores Maxi-Cash made its entry on Catalist followed by MoneyMax, also on the Catalist last September. A month later, ValueMax made its debut on the mainboard. Of the three, ValueMax, which has 17 outlets here, is the only one trading under water from its offer price of 51 cents. It closed at 44.5 cents yesterday after slipping one per cent.\n\nThe direction of gold prices have a heavy weighting on pawnbrokers' bottom line. For ValueMax, about 80 per cent of its business involves gold, be it the retail and trading of pre-owned jewellery or the pawnbroking business itself.\n\nThe group's outing in financial year 2013 attests to that - revenue slipped 31 per cent from a year ago due to the decline in gold prices. Net profit fell 35 per cent to $9.4 million.\n\nCompetition is cranking up with more players wanting a slice of the pawn pie; the number of pawnshops have nearly doubled to over 200 last year over five years. That could partly explain ValueMax's next step - to expand abroad even while it grows its business here. In fact, it is the only chain in Singapore which also has a presence outside. Through its associates, it has five outlets in Malaysia's southern state of Johor and is planning to add at least three more to the vault in that region while more stores could be in the offing.\n\nDoing business in Malaysia has some plus points. ValueMax is able to provide pawn loans at a higher interest rate of around 2 per cent across the Causeway whereas in Singapore, the maximum rate it can charge is legislated at 1.5 per cent - one of the lowest in the world. Higher rates translate to better margins. Another is lower cost.\n\nThe group is also seeking acquisitions abroad, perhaps even further afield.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/singaporean-take-super-rugby", "site_title": "A Singaporean take on Super Rugby", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nA Singaporean take on Super Rugby\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Mar 14, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSINGAPORE rugby could be poised to take off in a big way. Speculation is rife that the Republic is among the favourites to join the Super Rugby franchise in 2016. If it does, Singapore rugby stands to benefit hugely - as long as it does not get mired in disputes over its team's Singaporean-ness, as some other sports have. Neither should it get distracted from efforts to develop domestic rugby here.\n\nThe Singapore Rugby Union's (SRU) bid to join the franchise appears to have powered ahead of proposals from regional powerhouses Hong Kong and Japan on the back of the new Sports Hub and strong financial support. However, excitement over the prospect - no doubt shared by local Super Rugby Fantasy League players eager to draft their national team buddies into their squads - could lead to expectations of a purely \"Singaporean\" Super Rugby team, as opposed to what the SRU is actually proposing: an Asia-Pacific team based in Singapore.\n\nSuch parochial and nationalistic sentiment could easily gain traction - the first 10 results of a Google News search for \"Singapore Super Rugby\" mention the Asia-Pacific Dragons, the SRU's proposed team, only once. But if the team isn't going to be Singaporean, why base it here in the first place?\n\nFor several good reasons.\n\nFirst, it will raise the profile of the game here. The biggest Australian, Kiwi and South African names in rugby will have to come to Singapore to play the Dragons' home games. The celebrity factor and world-class talent could boost interest in the game, and thus justify more official support for the game.\n\nSecondly, top-tier competitions and professional teams bring with them the attendant support infrastructure. During the off-season, Super Rugby coaches, match officials and physiotherapists can support the local leagues and schools. The Dragons' players could also join local leagues and raise standards.\n\nIt also means more professional athletes residing here, interacting with locals, and appearing in the news, raising the profile of the sport and attracting more youngsters to it.\n\nBasketball executive Bob Turner, however, was quoted as saying last week that basing a foreign team here will not be enough. Mr Turner, who moved Australian basketball franchise Hunter Pirates to Singapore in 2006 and renamed them the Singapore Slingers, said the SRU team would have to field some Singaporeans to garner local support. \"It is their country and you're putting their name on your uniform.\"\n\nAt this stage of Singapore rugby, however, there isn't enough local talent to fill a competitive Super Rugby team. A \"Singaporean\" team of token locals hidden in a foreign majority could suffer death by social media. The result could irreversibly damage perceptions of local rugby. This is an outcome we can ill-afford.\n\nSingapore has already made a clear commitment to rugby with the World Club 10s it will host in June this year. It is also planning to bid for the Sevens World Series 2015-16 and the 2018 World Cup Sevens.\n\nThe SRU should resist the temptation to field locals in the Super Rugby league unless they really earn their place on merit. Rather, its Super Rugby campaign should focus on two things - increasing interest in rugby and improving its infrastructure here.\n\nThe result will be a highly entertaining and competitive Singapore-based Super Rugby team that attracts more fans and youngsters to the sport here. Also, promoting Super Rugby should not come at the expense of the planned development of the semi-professional local league that the SRU has promised.\n\nThe two can, and should, run in parallel. Still, the interest, glitz and glamour that the Super Rugby franchise could bring to rugby here cannot be underestimated. More importantly, perhaps, it should also set in motion forces which shape and grow the game in Singapore, and solidify rugby's position as a national sport. By working to raise the local game, the SRU can demonstrate the sustainability of its Super Rugby bid.\n\nThe potentially huge ticket sales, tourist revenue and $27 million in sponsorships may look impressive. But without a real local rugby culture, they will evaporate when the novelty wears out.\n\nBidding opens in June. Landing the franchise this early in the Sports Hub's lifetime may be a feather in its cap and could attract other prestigious sporting events. But the bigger challenge is to make rugby a sustainable franchise, commanding the interest and aspiration of an entire generation of budding sportsmen.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Mar 14, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT has the same 2.0-litre turbodiesel as the BMW 520d but the 320d feels like a completely different car. And little wonder. At 1,505 kg, the diesel-engined 3 Series is smaller and 200 kg lighter than the 5 Series version, thus making it a lot more fun to drive. The 320d has excellent low-end torque. Floor the throttle and it pulls away, thanks to the rapid delivery of 380 Newton-metres of torque.\n\nTo get an idea of how responsive it is, compare its performance figures to the 3 Series with a 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine - the 320d has the same power as the 320i but more torque than the 328i (both the 320i and 328i have the same four-cylinder unit but with different levels of tuning).\n\nIts zero to 100 km sprint is also comparable to the 320i - 7.4 seconds or just 0.1 second slower.\n\nBut the 320d is able to cruise for more than 1,400 km on a full tank (it consumes 3.9 litres per 100 km under the extra-urban cycle or 25.6 km/l, and 4.5 l/100 km under the combined cycle, or 22.2 km/l). This offers the possibility of driving from Singapore to Penang and back without refuelling.\n\nYet it costs the same as a 320i and handles just like its petrol-powered sibling. It is nimble with the same precise steering, and a firm but supple suspension. The sporty set-up provides an excellent grip, while electrically operated side bolsters keep both the driver and front seat passenger snug in their seats in fast corners. The 320d also has a Sport+ driving mode, which is not available on the 520d.\n\nUnlike the 520d, the 320d gets more equipment. The 320d is decked out in BMW Sport Line trim as standard, and some of the kit not found in the 520d includes front sport seats, a sport steering wheel and contrast stitching.\n\nBut like all BMW sedans offered here, the turbodiesel drives the rear wheels of the 320d through a smooth eight-speed automatic transmission with steering wheel-mounted shift paddles.\n\nAs with the majority of diesel models however, it loses out in one key area against the 3 Series with a petrol unit - the engine note. The sound is more obvious in the 320d than in the 520d, probably because of its acoustics and insulation. From the driver's seat, the diesel drone is obvious when accelerating, even with the windows up.\n\nUnfortunately, the aural aspect of a car completes any driving experience. Otherwise, carmakers won't be tuning the engine or piping more of its sound into the cabin. Performance and handling alone cannot produce true automotive satisfaction. Doing without a delicious engine or exhaust note is like eating a cake without a topping - it still tastes okay but you get the feeling there's something missing.\n\nsamuelee@sph.com.sg\n\nSPECS\n\nBMW 320d Sport\n\nEngine\n\n1,995cc turbodiesel\n\nTransmission\n\n8-speed automatic\n\nMax power\n\n184 hp @ 4,000 rpm\n\nMax torque\n\n380 Nm @ 1,750-2,750 rpm\n\n0-100 kmh\n\n7.4 secs\n\nTop speed\n\n230 kmh\n\nCO2 emissions\n\n118 g/km\n\nAverage OMV\n\n$46,000\n\nPrice\n\n$219,800 (with COE)\n\nDistributor\n\nPerformance Motors\n\nTel\n\n6319 0100\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Today, global stocks are up some 140 per cent from their 2009 lows.\n\nAs the bull run continues after developed market stocks posted 20 to 30 per cent gains last year, asset managers around the world remain broadly positive on stocks. They cite a slow but recovering global economy, a more resilient global financial system, and stronger corporate balance sheets.\n\nSome worry that the outflows from emerging markets have yet to end, with the deflating of asset bubbles potentially causing catastrophic consequences for highly-indebted countries. Yet there are few alternatives to stocks for investors to earn a return on.\n\n\"Cash investments are effectively paying nothing, and traditional areas of the bond market offer little return after factoring in the effects of inflation and taxes,\" said BlackRock's global chief investment strategist Russ Koesterich.\n\n\"We would say equities are no longer cheap and that stronger economic growth will be needed to drive earnings and prices higher. But we do believe stock prices are more likely to head higher rather than lower from here.\"\n\nBut Toby Lawson, head of financial futures and options and cash equities execution, Asia-Pacific, at global brokerage Newedge, said that at current levels, he expects just three to five per cent of upside potential.\n\n\"As we head towards this level we are seeing investors starting to take cover through defensive strategies like put options, and some profit taking,\" he said. \"One thing that keeps investors long equities is that the risk return is still favourable against other asset classes.\"\n\nOn Monday, March 9, 2009, the day that marked the bottom of the market, Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Index closed at 1,456.95 points. Banks closed at now-improbable lows: DBS closed at $6.45, OCBC at $3.95, and UOB at $8.20. Since then, markets rebounded with a vengeance. More crises came, such as the Eurozone debt crisis in 2011-12 or fiscal problems in the US. Each time, markets recovered to end higher.\n\nAt home, the top performer is OSIM International, a company known for its massage chairs. OSIM has returned more than 50 times from financial crisis lows, after writing off its investment in troubled US retailer Brookstone, raising money from a rights issue, and staging a remarkable profit recovery.\n\nOn the whole, said a Schroders note in February, the \"macroeconomic backdrop remains supportive for equities\". Its favourite developed markets remain US and Europe. Some 77 per cent of S&P 500 companies beat consensus earnings estimates in Q4 2013, the fund manager noted. It added that profit margins in Europe have room to grow versus the US.\n\nAnalysts were more divided on Japan, where a massive stimulus programme is underway to inflate its economy. The bullish point to earnings growth from a depreciating yen. But some worry about risks from a consumption tax hike next month.\n\nOutside of the developed world, slowing US monetary stimulus or \"tapering\" continues to affect emerging markets. With rising rates as developed markets recover, investors will prefer to shift money back there. In China, stocks are trading at five-year lows due to fears of financial instability, along with an economic slowdown. Slowing Chinese demand means commodity exporters like Brazil and Indonesia are also hit. Rising inflation is exacting a toll on the Brazilian economy, while Russian stocks, at already low levels, plunged further with the Ukraine crisis.\n\nKevin Scully, executive chairman of NRA Capital, said the worst is yet to come for emerging Asia. \"I'm a believer that if there's a credit crunch, it will happen in Asia,\" Mr Scully said. \"I think Asia is in trouble. China is too expensive, a lot of manufacturers are going back to the US. Countries geared into the China story like Singapore will have a bit of a problem.\"\n\nIn Singapore, real estate investment trusts (Reits) that yield 6 or 7 per cent or more might actually be worth buying, as they provide a sufficient buffer even if risk-free rates go up to 5 per cent, he suggested.\n\nStandard Chartered Bank upgraded its 2014-16 forecasts of office rents by 18 per cent due to strong demand, tight supply, and lower than expected vacancy rates. \"We now expect prime and Grade A rents to rise 40 per cent in 2014-16,\" Stanchart said. \"Our top pick is Keppel Reit given its 80 per cent exposure to Singapore Grade A office assets.\"\n\nWith a softening property market, however, Mr Scully thinks bank earnings will be affected. Oil and gas counters might have large order books, but their margins are under pressure. They are also taking on the risk of customers not being able to pay up if a business downturn hits, he said. \"You still need to put a decent amount in equities, maybe 50 to 60 per cent, skewed towards the US. The US has more legs, corporate America is still very strong financially . . . If the STI fell below 2,900 that would be great. I can afford to wait.\"\n\nOthers are more sanguine on Asia. UBS Bank anticipates North Asian equities to outperform in the next six months as the global economy recovers. It prefers China and South Korea. OCBC's head of investment research Carmen Lee said the S&P 500, with forward valuations of almost 16 times forecast earnings and price to book ratios of 2.5 times and dividend yields of 2.1 per cent, is at the higher end of historical measures.\n\n\"By comparison, indices for Singapore and Hong Kong are trading at lower price-to-book ratios of 1.2 to 1.3 times and offering better dividend yields of 3.4 per cent and 3.9 per cent, respectively,\" she said. The global economy is now on a stronger footing and can better withstand economic shocks, she added.\n\nMeanwhile, in its latest Singapore strategy report on March 7, DBS noted: \"Sectors which could provide upside earnings surprises are banks (net interest margins could surprise), plantations (drought pushes up crude palm oil prices), and water treatment on more engineering, procurement and construction contracts from China\".\n\nInvestors could position themselves in stocks with recent surprises in their dividend payouts like M1 and China Merchants Holdings Pacific, it said.\n\nCIMB kept its end-2014 STI target of 3,600, recommending large-cap names like First Resources, Singapore Exchange, Thai Beverage, and smaller ones like Del Monte Pacific, Sarine Technologies, and Ho Bee Land. Mr Scully of NRA remains cautious on Singapore. \"After I've seen eight or nine bear markets, it's good to take the contrarian view,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But, they add, bitcoin will survive the damage.\n\n\"It's just growing pains,\" says Keith Jarvis, a security researcher at Dell SecureWorks. \"Bitcoin is large enough and has enough momentum behind it to survive any public relations damage from this (Mt Gox) case or anything else.\"\n\nThe fall of Mt Gox, the Tokyo- based exchange which filed for bankruptcy last month after saying it lost some 850,000 bitcoins to hackers, is certainly the virtual currency's biggest crisis.\n\nBut data collated by Reuters from specialist bitcoin industry websites and Internet forums show that more than 730,000 bitcoins were already missing to theft, hacking, cyber-ransom payments and other apparently criminal pursuits before Mt Gox's collapse. That's nearly 6 per cent of all bitcoins, and doesn't include dozens, possibly hundreds, of unreported cases of individuals who have lost bitcoins from their computers or online exchanges to hackers.\n\nFor sure, there's no way of telling who has these missing bitcoins, or whether they were converted to real money when the price was much lower. And of course, some bitcoins may have been counted twice if criminals stole them from each other or they were put back into circulation and stolen again.\n\nBut there's no question that bitcoins have attracted the attention of cyber-criminals - as a currency and an asset worth stealing. A study by Pat Litke and Joe Stewart of Dell SecureWorks showed that as the price of bitcoin soared beyond US$1,000 last year, so did the number of viruses designed to steal bitcoins from wallets - programs that hold bitcoins on user's computers or smartphones. Of the 140 types of such software, more than 100 appeared in the past year.\n\nWriting such viruses, says Mr Stewart, is easy. \"There's no sophistication involved in the storage of bitcoin in wallets. As for malware, it's some of the easiest stuff to write.\"\n\nIndeed, this cyber-pocket picking wasn't criminals' first foray into bitcoins. Initially, they focused on using their control of large networks of infected computers - called botnets - to make their own bitcoins.\n\nBitcoins are created through a \"mining\" process where a computer's resources are used to perform millions of calculations. For a while, says Kirill Levchenko, a researcher at the University of California, San Diego, criminals added malware to their botnets to turn infected computers into bitcoin miners.\n\nThis triggered predictions of doom for bitcoin - that criminals would take over the mining of bitcoin through botnets and bring the whole currency crashing down. But as bitcoins become harder to mine - according to an algorithm that slows down their production the more people try to create them - this approach has proven less profitable.\n\nIn 2012-13, says Danny Huang, another researcher at the University of California, San Diego, they earned at least 4,500 bitcoins, a relatively small sum compared with the total produced. \"Few botnets are mining bitcoins now,\" he says. Instead, they've turned to stealing from wallets, or more lucratively, exchanges.\n\nAccording to data compiled last year by academics Tyler Moore and Nicholas Christin, of 40 exchanges tracked, 18 had closed, with customer balances wiped out in many cases - not always, they point out, due to fraud. Since then, according to public reports, more than a dozen others have been hacked.\n\nCyber-criminals have also made use of the ease with which bitcoins can be traded without any third party - such as a bank or online payment service such as PayPal - to use it as at least one way of paying for services between themselves.\n\n\"Bitcoin made it much easier for them because they have to trust each other even less. Even complete strangers can cooperate,\" says Juraj Bednar, a bitcoin security specialist in Slovakia.\n\nBut while bitcoin has its advantages, it's not a perfect tool for the bad guys.\n\nTake, for example, ransomware. Viruses which encrypt users' data and then demand payment for a key to unlock it have become increasingly sophisticated, says Dell SecureWorks' Mr Jarvis.\n\nThe most successful: CryptoLocker, which he believes is run by a Russian-speaking gang who are also behind a botnet called Gameover Zeus that targets financial websites.\n\nBitcoin often appears on CryptoLocker as an option for victims to pay up. Its appeal, says Mr Bednar, lies in the fact that it needs no third party for the transaction to work.\n\nBut there have been problems. For one thing, the type of user to be infected by a virus wasn't likely to be the type who is technologically savvy enough to be familiar with bitcoin. Also, as bitcoin rose in value, it has become a more expensive option for the victim, forcing the criminals to lower their bitcoin ransom demands to match prevailing exchange rates.\n\nThen, there's bitcoin's transparency. All transactions are visible, and while they're just digits and letters, in theory they could be connected to an individual and the entire history of all the bitcoin's transactions traced.\n\nItalian computer engineer Michele Spagnuolo, for example, was able to trace a number of ransom payments for CryptoLocker. The gains have been impressive: he and academics from Politecnico di Milano speculate that up to 6,757 bitcoins - then worth around US$6 million - could be linked to those behind CryptoLocker late last year. That estimate of their total takings, he says, could be very conservative.\n\nBut the fact that such payments can be traced would raise a red flag for cyber-criminals, says Daniel Cohen of RSA, the security division of EMC Corp, even though there are online services that can \"launder\" bitcoins to hide their origin. \"Sure, there are bitcoin laundering services, but still if I tie a wallet to an identity I can see every single movement,\" he says.\n\nAnd, ironically, the success that some criminals have had in stealing bitcoins has made it less appealing to the underworld. RSA's Mr Cohen says that his team that's monitoring underground forums has noticed that criminals of late see bitcoin as \"volatile, seizable and, with the recent thefts, unsafe\".\n\nThat's not to say bitcoin is out of the woods. While the protocols underlying bitcoin have proven themselves to work, the weak links have been the software containing the wallets, whether on exchanges or on individuals' computers.\n\nSays Raj Samani of Intel Corp's Internet security company McAfee: \"The attacks on the exchanges did not in themselves indicate any particular weakness of bitcoin per se, but rather exploiting vulnerabilities within the exchanges.\"\n\nSuch holes are being addressed, says Dell SecureWorks' Mr Stewart, pointing to such innovations as hardware wallets to replace software ones. \"We're just going to have to get into that mode of thinking.\"\n\nFor now, bitcoin users remain a vulnerable target.Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

The exchange then compiles this information in a report that is issued the following morning before the market opens.\n\nAs a follow-up to this marking of sell orders, the authorities last month proposed the implementation of aggregate position reporting and disclosure of significant individual short positions beyond a threshold that is yet to be determined.\n\nThe 2013 move and latest proposals represent an advancement over where the market was a few years ago, when there was absolutely no information at all on shorting activity and investors had to rely purely on speculation and hearsay.\n\nThe problem is that even after the recent proposals are implemented, the picture conveyed is still not as good as it could be. As always with disclosure, there is considerable room for improvement.\n\nFirst, even though dealers are obliged to mark their short trades when they are entered, some have reported that when prices are moving quickly or when clients ring and demand swift execution, this requirement is ignored because time is of the essence. This means that the daily reports could understate the number of trades marked as short and that this discrepancy could be greatest when the market is hot and volatile, which is arguably precisely when accurate figures are needed.\n\nSecond, there is only limited value in publishing the report the following day as traders would not be able to easily correlate the figures to see how much of volume done in either an individual stock or the whole market was due to short selling.\n\nThird and possibly most important is to note SGX has cautioned on its Web page that information gleaned from the marking of short sales data may not reflect outstanding shorts because it would include trades which have since been squared off by offsetting buy trades.\n\nWhat this means is that as things stand today, not only is SGX's short summary released a day late, it may be understated and does not properly show outstanding positions. In other words, it only offers a very rough gauge of bearish sentiment and could be of questionable value.\n\nTo compensate for all these limitations, the exchange should append a twice-daily scrip borrowing/lending (SBL) summary to give investors a fuller picture of which stocks have been lent out, most probably for shorting. The first report should be at midday, followed by the full-day summary as soon after 5.10pm as possible.\n\nThe starting point for collating this information should be SGX's own SBL business. According to its website, there are about 600 securities eligible for borrowing and lending, and 11,600 participating investors lending through SBL to 18 financial institutions.\n\nWhen studying SBL disclosure, guidance should come from the Hong Kong model, where only designated securities, that is stocks for which scrip can be borrowed, can be shorted.\n\nThe designated list is revised every quarter and currently contains 695 stocks. Among the requirements for designation is a market capitalisation of at least HK$3 billion (presumably to protect small-cap stocks from falling victim to shorting) and an aggregate turnover during the preceding 12 months to market capitalisation ratio of more than 50 per cent.\n\nThe HK exchange publishes two short-selling reports every day so investors can keep close tabs on trends and changes in short positions. Whether or not these reports are useful is of course debatable, but at least there is some assurance that the data is as accurate as possible.\n\nThe same consideration should apply here, given that the present practice, even after being enhanced by the new proposals, may not paint an accurate or useful enough picture.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The first domestic bond default by a Chinese company is prompting more onshore issuers to consider issuing offshore bonds, which provide a cheaper form of financing, according to Ken Wong, Barclays head of bond syndicate for Asia ex-Japan.\n\nMr Wong said that some mainland companies are finding it harder to tap the onshore bond market or have to pay a high premium following the default by Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology last week.\n\n\"We may see more supply of CNH bonds and a bigger proportion from Chinese borrowers,\" he added.\n\nThe widened renminbi qualified foreign institutional investor (RQFII) scheme, through which offshore renminbi can be invested back into the Chinese mainland, will also encourage more mainland companies to issue offshore bonds.\n\nAt the same time, there is still demand from multinational companies looking to launch more CNH bonds this year, Mr Wong added. \"Appetite for good offshore renminbi issuance is still overwhelming,\" he said, particularly for good names and familiar brands.\n\nBut the lack of depth in the offshore market and the shorter duration of tenures are still constraining the growth of the CNH bond market, though secondary liquidity has improved since the inception of the CNH bonds.\n\n\"Credit strength and credit familiarity is on the top of everyone's mind,\" said Clifford Lee, DBS Bank head of fixed income. \"The sweet spot still surrounds tenures of three to five years.\"\n\nMr Lee noted that the interest rate differential would remain a major driver for demand in dim sum bonds. The market provides a cheap form of refinancing for the over 90 billion yuan of offshore renminbi bonds maturing this year, he said.\n\nThese maturing bonds may, however, be pressured by the market to provide more covenants for investors, said Ivan Chung, senior credit officer for project infrastructure finance group at Moody's.\n\nThe panellists pointed out that recent volatility in renminbi has dampened issuers' interest in using CNH bonds for arbitrage. But as the market moves away from a one-way bet of the renminbi, there is demand for more risk management through structured products.\n\nWhen the renminbi converges with CNH depends on how soon China reforms its financial market, said Mr Wong, adding that offshore bonds are still likely to trade lower than the onshore bonds in the short run. Beijing has set 2020 as the target year for full renminbi convertibility.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Case in point: Case - officially the Consumers Association of Singapore - and its little spat with food centre operator Kopitiam over the consumer rights watchdog's survey about beer prices. The tiff could have been averted if Case had simply carried out a better survey. Case this week issued a report that showed substantial price hikes at two Kopitiam outlets following Singapore's plans to raise alcohol duties. Kopitiam in turn accused Case of bad survey methodology. Both parties are correct, which is to say one is just as wrong as the other.\n\nLet's begin with a fundamental principle: The idea of profiteering is quite tenuous when there is no monopoly or collusion, the product is not in limited supply, and there are viable alternatives to the product. That makes the original premise of the survey, which was to investigate complaints about outlets raising their alcohol prices by too much, a little problematic. So what if Kopitiam charges an arm and a leg at one of its outlets for a bottle of Tiger Beer? Customers are not forced to get their beer from them. It's a functioning market with no obvious sign of collusion. Sellers will price their goods at whatever buyers let them get away with.\n\nPart of the problem is that there are various reasons why the price of an item might be increased. Rents may have gone up, labour costs may be higher, or perhaps the seller simply is not so interested in selling more of an item. Maybe Kopitiam just does not want to have too many people drinking at its outlets.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

And this month, the 78-year-old artist's plans have finally materialised in the form of an exhibition titled Ho Ho Ying - Present, which opened at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (Nafa) Galleries on March 1.\n\nHo wanted to showcase his work from the 1950s till recent years at his seventh solo exhibition simply because he felt it was the right time, he says.\n\n\"I'm already almost 80 years old, and I've had solo shows before but those were always categorised by the type of art,\" he points out. \"This one takes one or two works here and there from the beginning till now. And it's right after the Cultural Medallion, so it's a good time for me to open up to the public,\" adds Ho, who was born in Hainan, China, and moved to Singapore around 1951.\n\nThe exhibition features over 80 selected artworks including early sketches from the 1950s, oil paintings, acrylic paintings and Chinese ink works. Of these, about 40 pieces are for sale, with prices ranging from $8,000 to $30,000.\n\nHo first discovered his interest in art when he was studying at Chinese High School in the mid-1950s and took lessons under pioneer artists Liu Kang and Chen Wen Hsi. They were the ones who taught him Chinese art forms like calligraphy and ink paintings, as well as Western styles of oil, and watercolour.\n\nThough he initially started out with realistic portrayals of people and still-life objects, he was quick to evolve his artistic style, and eventually started painting abstract works by the end of the 1950s. Says Ho: \"My abstract paintings don't focus on actual objects. When I have the mood to draw then I draw, stroke by stroke, then it'll gradually develop to form the painting. After I complete it, I will sit down and observe what it is about the painting that stands out. Only then will I see what the meaning is behind it.\"\n\nHo has been one of the leading artists in Singapore for over half a century, having founded two arts societies - the Modern Art Society in 1964, and the now defunct Nanyang University Art Association in 1959.\n\nBut even though he has been around for a long time, Ho is still on the lookout for ways to keep his works innovative and fresh, and intends to continue making new artworks for as long as his health allows. He says: \"In life, there will always be something new to learn. Because everything always changes. So never reject learning new skills in art. I may be good in calligraphy but I don't reject other types of artworks. We have to always be improving.\"\n\n'Ho Ho Ying - Present' runs till March 30 at Nafa Campus 1 at 80 Bencoolen Street, Galleries 1 & 2. Opening hours are from 11am to 7pm daily, except on Mondays.\n\nAdmission is free. Go to www.nafa.edu.sg or email\n\nartgalleries@nafa.edu.sg\n\nfor more information.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It was the sixth straight decline. The vacancy rate rose to 1.87 per cent from 1.69 per cent, while owner concessions also climbed.\n\nManhattan landlords have retreated after 23 months of raising prices to make up for ground lost during the recession. Median rents increased 15 per cent from the bottom in November 2009 and were approaching the 2006 high of US$3,265 a month before they began to slide in September.\n\nSome tenants are being drawn into the sales market, while those who remain leasers are resisting higher rates, according to Jonathan Miller, president of New York-based Miller Samuel.\n\n\"The owners were pushing and pushing and pushing and they weren't relenting in any way shape or form,\" Gary Malin, president of brokerage Citi Habitats, which also released a report on the Manhattan rental market yesterday. \"They just assumed they could continue.\"\n\nBuyers rushed to complete purchases as a spike in mortgage rates from near-record lows in May threatened to make homes more costly. In the fourth quarter, Manhattan condominium and co-op sales reached the highest total for the period in 25 years of record-keeping, according to Miller Samuel and Douglas Elliman.\n\nThe surge in deals helped push up the apartment vacancy rate and reduce some of the landlords' pricing power, Mr Miller said.\n\n\"New York, in our assessment, is simply taking a pause,\" David Santee, chief operating officer of Equity Residential, the country's largest publicly traded apartment landlord, said on the company's Feb 5 earnings call.\n\nAt Equity Residential's 26 Manhattan properties, the number of tenants moving out to buy apartments increased almost 20 per cent in the final three months of last year, Mr Santee said.\n\n\"If we see decreases in traffic then we know that maybe we pushed too far with our rents,\" Tom Lebling, senior vice-president of property management at Chicago-based Equity Residential, said on Wednesday. \"If we see increases in people's notices to vacate, we realise we may have to back off.\"\n\nThe company still expects rent increases for lease renewals at its Manhattan buildings to average 4 per cent in the first quarter, Mr Santee said.\n\nLandlords offered concessions, such as a month's free rent, on 9 per cent of all new Manhattan leases last month, up from 5.5 per cent a year earlier, according to Miller Samuel and Douglas Elliman. The number of new lease agreements climbed 3.1 per cent, suggesting tenants were leaving their apartments in search of better deals elsewhere, Mr Miller said.\n\nSome tenants may have headed to Brooklyn. Rents in the borough, New York's most populous, surged 12 per cent last month, bringing the monthly median to US$2,890, or just US$210 less than in Manhattan, Miller Samuel and Douglas Elliman said. The spread is the narrowest it's been since the firms began tracking the market in January 2008.\n\nCiti Habitats in its report said that 12 per cent of new leases in February included incentives, up from 8 per cent a year earlier and the most in two years. The sweeteners helped push the vacancy rate to 1.5 per cent, down from 1.62 per cent in January and the lowest since September, the brokerage said.\n\nGarn Nibley and his wife didn't want to pay a broker's fee so they searched websites for a two-bedroom apartment, setting a monthly budget of no more than US$3,000. Responding to an online advertisement, they connected with Lorett Vigon, a broker at Citi Habitats, who agreed to help them find a place that met their needs, on their financial terms.\n\nMs Vigon directed the couple to a 70-square-metre duplex on East 32nd Street in Murray Hill that had one bedroom plus two separate loft spaces. It was one of three vacancies in the 71-unit building and the asking rent was US$3,495.\n\nThe landlord didn't want the apartments to go empty \"and they were willing to work with us to help make it happen,\" Ms Vigon said.\n\nA two-year lease was offered with no cost increases and one free month. Ms Vigon waived her usual fee of 15 per cent of the annual rent and agreed to accept US$3,495 instead.\n\n\"It was effectively a no-fee condition,\" said Mr Nibley, 55, a pilot for American Airlines. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

Where are they now?", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nDoggone it! Where are they now?\n\nDebbie Yong examines the recent evolution of gourmet hot dogs in Singapore, and why they never got quite as sizzling as gourmet burgers\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Mar 14, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHEY made a ferocious entry to Singapore, but scattered as quickly as they came - and with nary a whimper. This time two years ago, there were at least eight standalone outlets offering different takes on gourmet hot dogs, or hot dog sandwiches made with premium sausages rather than your low-brow canned frankfurter.\n\nBut recent young shoots aside, a scarce few of those ventures seem to have lasted the distance. Gourmet dogs and craft beer joint Li'l Papa's Wieners Beerstro, which closed in Craig Road in June, last month re-opened as craft beer retail kiosk The Papa Shop in Kallang - sans the hot dogs.\n\nEarlier casualties include Superdog at Vivocity, The Purple Mustard at Icon Village in Tanjong Pagar, Zen Dog at The Sail at Marina Bay, and gourmet dog and artisan coffee joint Homebodies in Boat Quay, which has since been reconceptualised as Ah Sam's Cold Drink Stall under the same owners. Even O My Dog at Great World City, which opened in September 2011 serving dogs made with grain-fed meats in flavours such as truffle mushroom and bak chor mee, has now scaled down its operations to a weekend-only affair.\n\nCold response to hot dogs\n\nWhy exactly haven't gourmet hot dogs taken off here?\n\nLow-priced hot dog buns from local confectioneries, cinema snack counters and even furniture retailer Ikea's deli counter have a part to play, say gourmet hot dog purveyors.\n\n\"A plain bun with a boiled chicken frankfurter inside for 50 cents or a dollar, to most people, that is a hot dog, plain and simple,\" says The Purple Mustard's co-owner Willie Sng. \"And once the general public has a perception of a hot dog bun as something made from low-quality, processed meat, it is hard to change their minds that it could be something better,\" he adds. Gourmet hot dogs typically start from $6 and can go up to $12 with premium condiments.\n\n\"Singaporeans don't view hot dogs as a meal. When they go out for lunch, they want a meal, and they want to sit down,\" says Dan Segall, who previously partnered with local actor-turned-fitness guru Robin Leong to run hot dog counter Zen Dog. \"In New York, you'd grab a hot dog and soda and eat while walking back to your office for lunch.\"\n\nAgreeing, Janet Lim, spokeswoman for the Spa Esprit Group behind O My Dog, says the biggest challenge is presenting the hot dog as more than just a snack. Relative to the gourmet burger trend, which has taken off by leaps and bounds here, she believes that burgers benefit from having an \"image of quality\" compared to hot dogs. \"Burger patties are often thought to be made from a whole cut of meat, which gives burger sellers more room to play about with the different grades of beef, and customers the option to customise their burger in any way they like,\" she explains, adding that patties are often perceive to be made in restaurants, and hence more fresh.\n\nThis also leads to another point: gourmet hot dogs are a labour-intensive business to run. \"It was tiring. It's not like taking ready-made dogs out of a jar. They takes awhile to grill, and you have to prepare the toppings and assemble it with many condiments,\" says The Papa Shop's Fabio de Souza on why he has dropped hot dogs from the menu at this new outlet. He would re-introduce them if he could hire a kitchen team just for the hot dogs, but with the current shortage of manpower in the F&B industry, he says: \"It was just not a cost effective business to run.\"\n\nBut Mr Sng believes this can be mitigated with some logistical tweaks. At its peak, The Purple Mustard would have as many as 300 hot dogs orders within a two-hour lunch rush, \"but we ran the kitchen restaurant-style, where everything was cooked a la minute, which slowed things down.\" Mr Sng is also co-owner of four-month-old The Mustard Incident, where he has consequently streamlined the cooking processes to churn out the hot dogs more quickly. The Orchard Road location, however, means that diners come more evenly throughout the day, he says.\n\nOther factors\n\nLike him, other gourmet hot dog sellers believe that demand for gourmet dogs is still growing, and the string of closures should not be seen as an indication of lacklustre demand.\n\n\"It's anybody's guess why certain businesses go under and why they don't. It could be anything from rent and being in the wrong location to labour, or pricing your product wrongly,\" Mr Segall offers. Zen Dog closed when its six-month lease \"as a pop-up stall to test the concept\" was up and his business partners wanted to focus on other priorities, he says, adding that if it were up to him alone, he'd gladly go into the business again. \"I've got a list of recipes done up, all I need is a lease in a suitable venue, 100 sq ft of space and $20,000 to stock it and pay staff, and I can have a shop open within a month,\" he claims.\n\nThe Purple Mustard primarily closed due to differences among its partners, while Ms Lim says that O My Dog now operates on weekends as its location within the family-oriented Great World City shopping mall means that it is mostly crowded only on weekends. \"Perhaps the concept will work better in locations with fast-moving consumers such as in a kiosk in a foodhall. or if it is run alongside a diner concept, which will give people more choices,\" she suggests.\n\nCatching up\n\nStill, the new entrants are staying upbeat despite mentions of the closures. \"Gourmet burgers took awhile to take off here, and I believe hot dogs are not far behind,\" says Jonathan Shen, spokesman for week-old Hopdogs in Clarke Quay, referring to them as \"a less pretentious version of a burger\".\n\n\"The upside is that through popular culture like movies and television shows, everyone will see what a real hot dog should be like,\" adds Mr Sng. Anthony Bourdain's popular \"No Reservations\" series, for instance, had an entire episode dedicated to Chicago-style dogs, he points out.\n\nBoth believe that presenting the gourmet hot dogs as a complete meal is the key to boosting its image as more than a mere snack. A set meal at The Mustard Incident comes with a side of chilli and a drink while Hopdogs' sandwiches are served with complimentary nachos on the side. \"We built the outside for those looking for a quick bite, and indoor dining tables for those who want to sit down and have it as a proper meal,\" says Hopdogs' Mr Shen.\n\n\"People don't just come here for the hot dogs, but to cosume the whole culture that surrounds it. Hot dog stands in the US are traditionally social gathering points where you end up talking to the person next to you, and that's what we tried to recreate here,\" adds The Mustard Incident's Kelly Koh of his stand's four-stool perch.

Queries and warnings were dispatched for penny stocks Giken Sakata and Ziwo Holdings, counters whose trading arguably has limited reach and impact, while nothing was said throughout Olam International's spectacular month-long rise that had everyone talking and that culminated in yesterday's announcement of a Temasek Holdings takeover.\n\nIt might be tempting to attribute regulatory inaction to a rise in the entire commodities sector. After all, there was speculation that Noble Group might sell its agriculture business for US$1 billion which, together with a concurrent rise in commodity prices, did lead analysts to say that the whole sector justified a re-rating.

He was also co-writer of last year's hit animated film, The Croods.\n\n\"In the last five to six years, I had to earn a lot of money and sometimes I was doing some things that weren't as artistically interesting as what I used to do,\" admits the 74-year-old over the phone from Sydney early this week, amid his Australian tour.\n\n\"I was doing a lot of work for money and when you do that, you can't afford to scan the horizon and think about what you want to do next.\"\n\nRenowned for his black humour, you're not quite sure if Cleese is totally serious when he says that he did name his one-man-show The Alimony Tour when it first kicked off in 2009.\n\nIt's become such a big success that it hasn't stopped touring the world since. When it made a stop in Canada last year, it was changed to Last Chance To See Me Before I Die and will be retitled to a more sedate An Evening With John Cleese when it comes to Singapore for two nights in May.\n\nBut it won't be any less funny as Cleese promises \"an evening of well-honed anecdotes, psychoanalytical tit-bits and unprovoked attacks on former colleagues, especially Michael Palin\". The latter is a fellow member of Monty Python, which Cleese co-founded and shot to fame with. Its other surviving members including Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle and Terry Jones have reunited for a run of sold-out dates in the UK in July.\n\n\"I vary the show here and there; like in Canada, I removed a lot of things about New Zealand which the people won't get whereas I put it back in for Australia because they love it,\" says Cleese, of his own solo shows. \"But of course those bits on my childhood and parents are not really affected.\"\n\nEven though Cleese has visited Singapore numerous times as a tourist - especially during the seventies when the Concorde would stop here when he was en route to Australia where he used to do a lot of television commercials - the two upcoming shows he's performing here would be his first-ever in Asia.\n\nBut he's no stranger to playing to a new audience, having taken the tour as far as the Middle East.\n\n\"I've done the show a couple of times in Dubai and that's quite interesting because it's very difficult to pick up the reaction there,\" he notes. \"You look out into the stalls and all you see in the third row are people in full Arab headdresses sitting there in their beautiful white costumes; but a lot of them are educated overseas so they get (the humour).\"\n\nHe reveals that he plans to get to know the Singapore audience a little better by including a special question-and-answer session at the end of his upcoming shows here. \"It'll be quite an experiment but we'll just have to suck it and see,\" he adds.\n\nWhen asked what cracks him up after enjoying an illustrious five-decade career of making other people laugh, the comedian whose lanky frame was put to good use in a well-known Monty Python sketch called The Ministry of Silly Walks, replies dryly and without hesitation: \"Modern politics; I just find it hilarious.\"\n\nJohn Cleese performs at the University Cultural Centre Hall at NUS on May 4 and May 5 at 8pm.

Not to worry, because the only danger is a broken heart or two - belonging to Adele (Kate Winslet) and her 13-year-old son Henry (Gattlin Griffith), whose home Frank is holed up in.\n\nLabor Day is the movie equivalent of a True Romance novel where the women are filled with perpetual hope and longing; and the men are tall, dark and terrific cooks.\n\nDirector Jason Reitman appears to have escaped as well - from making quirky quality films such as Thank You for Smoking (2005), Juno (2007) and Up in the Air (2009). How he ended up here is the biggest mystery of all, because Labor Day is pure romantic mush, about as believable as a politician's election-day speech.\n\nIt's a holiday weekend. Take one desperate housewife, her psyche shattered by a failed marriage and one too many miscarriages, add a shy and impressionable young boy in dire need of a father figure, then drop in a hunky escapee who's handy around the house and knows how to bake a peach pie. Stir vigorously, then sit back and squirm.\n\nFrank is such a jolly good fellow that he also fixes cars, gives Henry tips on how to play baseball and picks tunes on the cello - what suburban female wouldn't want a piece of that action?\n\nLabor Day purports to be a psychological study about adult and adolescent yearning but its true intent is far too obvious. The film is narrated by a grown-up Henry (Tobey Maguire) and fails to take a risk of any kind.\n\nThere are several cringe-worthy scenes, not the least of which is a pie making sequence that belongs in every budding food porn producer's playbook.\n\nWhile mum makes goo-goo eyes at Frank, the gullible Henry is targeted for some rough verbal foreplay by a manipulative schoolmate (Brighid Fleming) who easily squeezes information from him. His father (Clark Gregg), preoccupied with his new wife and family, makes a half-hearted effort at bonding with him.\n\nMeanwhile, Frank's back story is told in a series of equally unconvincing flashbacks, revealing how he was sent to prison in the first place.\n\nLabor Day, written by Reitman and based on the book of the same name by Joyce Maynard, is unabashed female escapist fare - Frank's reassuring voice, his strong hands and his way with a rolling pin are dead giveaways as to the nature of the film. Frank, Adele and Henry are merely sad souls in search of happily ever after - who are we to deprive them?\n\nRating:\n\nC\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That compared with an almost doubling in sales in the first two months of 2013. The government doesn't provide data for individual months and releases a compounded figure throughout the year.\n\n\"The bad figures from the property sector are sending the government an alarm that it will somehow need to relax restrictions on the sector,\" said Jack Gong, a Hong Kong-based property analyst at Orient Finance. \"The economy is slowing down obviously and property is intertwined with so many other industries.\"\n\nPremier Li Keqiang said yesterday that there's some flexibility around the nation's target of 7.5 per cent growth this year, without specifying how much of a slowdown leaders would tolerate. The government will curb demand for housing among investors and will regulate the housing market \"differently in different cities\", Mr Li said at a press conference in Beijing.\n\nAt least 10 Chinese cities stepped up measures to calm local property markets at the end of last year.\n\nInvestment in homes, office buildings, malls and other types of real estate climbed 19 per cent to 795.6 billion yuan in the first two months, according to the statistics bureau. New property construction fell 27 per cent to 166.9 million square metres.\n\nHome sales volume fell 1.2 per cent in the January-February period to 93.8 million square metres from the same period a year earlier, the government data showed. Property sales value including office buildings and retail space dropped 3.7 per cent to 709 billion yuan from a year ago.\n\nShanghai Stock Exchange Property Index rose 0.4 per cent as at 2.24 pm yesterday, compared with a 0.7 per cent gain in the benchmark measure. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

The special-purpose vehicle will inject funds into the operators, which will then acquire the properties from Miyako. This is similar to the holding structure for all its previous acquisitions in Japan, the Reit said.\n\nThe purchase price is about 6 per cent below the total valuation of the properties, as valued by independent valuer International Appraisals Incorporated.\n\nThe acquisition is expected to be completed by June.\n\nEach of the properties will have a fresh 15-year building lease agreement with Miyako Enterprise at an annual gross rental of about 240 million yen.\n\nThe Reit said the long-term lease will improve its weighted average lease expiry from 10.52 years to 10.72 years. The properties are also likely to generate a net property yield of 7.3 per cent.\n\nMiyako Enterprise is no stranger to the Reit. Its associated company Miyako Kenkokai operates two of the Reit's other nursing homes in Japan.\n\nPLife Reit, making the payment in cash, will fully fund the consideration using a six-year committed and unsecured JPY loan facility of up to 3.5 billion yen, with low interest rates of 1.65 per annum.\n\n\"The deployment of JPY debt (provides) a natural hedge for foreign exchange risks arising from JPY-denominated assets, thereby insulating PLife Reit from JPY foreign exchange fluctuations, and enabling it to maintain a stable net asset value,\" it added.\n\nYong Yean Chau, CEO of the Reit manager, noted that private sector investors are intensifying their efforts to acquire properties in Japan's healthcare sector amid continuous strong government support to this market.\n\nThese latest acquisitions will boost the Reit's Japan portfolio to 43 properties worth $505 million, or about a third of its total assets under management.\n\nHSBC Institutional Trust Services (Singapore) Limited acted as a trustee for the Reit on the deal.\n\nUnits of the Reit closed four cents, or 1.8 per cent, higher at $2.31 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Unlike Neko no Niwa, which charges patrons $12 for the first hour and $5 per subsequent hour, The Cat Cafe will impose a flat per-entry fee of $15, with no limit on how long patrons linger.

The Foster and Partners-designed project will boast two towers with slanting facades oriented to catch prevailing winds and direct air flow to cool ground-level spaces.\n\nIn Singapore's Civic and Cultural District, three conserved buildings, Capitol Theatre, Capitol Building and Stamford House, are being integrated as part of the Capitol Singapore project; there will also be a new tower that will include Eden Residences Capitol, featuring 39 exclusive residences.\n\nLast year, units in Eden Residences Capitol and Clermont Residence were sold at $3,000-$3,200 per square foot - surpassing the average transacted price in 2013 for other luxury condos of about $2,600 psf, according to DTZ.\n\nBeyond generating monetary value in terms of superior pricing performance and supporting the value of surrounding real estate, iconic residential projects also help attract foreign investors and global high net worth individuals to reside and work here, argues DTZ in The Business Times Property 2014 supplement. Thus, these projects augment Singapore's hub status and create a more diverse and vibrant environment. \"The Singapore story - political stability, ease of doing business, strong currency and transparent legal framework - continues to attract luxury home buyers,\" observed DTZ head of Singapore research Lee Lay Keng.\n\nIndeed, purchases by foreigners (excluding Singapore permanent residents) of private homes priced above $5 million each held up last year - at 106 units each in 2012 and 2013. This contrasts with declines of 27 per cent and 44 per cent in purchases by Singapore PRs and Singaporeans to 113 units and 273 units in 2013 respectively.\n\n\"HNWIs are likely to seek out iconic residential projects as they are interested in trophy assets and bragging rights to owning such properties ...\" said Ms Lee.\n\nPanoramic views, world-class design and architecture and personalised services for residences are all par for the course for iconic projects in Singapore that capture buyers' imaginations.\n\nA chance to own a slice of history could be another distinguishing feature of these developments, along with sustainability features and a green lung. For example, some units at Marina One Residences will look into a biodiversity garden at the central core of the mixed development project.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Why can't we do it this year?\" he said, adding that he was confident in the state of the economy.\n\nChina has embarked on a vast reform programme aimed at restructuring its economy to a more sustainable, efficient model. This includes giving the market a bigger role, restructuring state-owned enterprises and cleaning up the financial sector as mounting debts from banks and local governments rise to the surface, potentially destabilising the economy.\n\nAnalysts say that reform will be beneficial in the long-term, but will eat away at growth rates as China deals with inherent overcapacity, cheap credit, shadow banking and inefficient SOEs. The economy grew 7.7 per cent last year, its slowest rate in decades and analysts say that figure could drop to under 7.5 per cent this year.\n\nThe central bank has been tightening credit conditions for over a year, putting pressure on interbank lending rates, local government finances and bonds issued by companies. It is unclear just how much growth China is willing to give up and some question whether the 7.5 per cent growth rate announced last week is compatible with deeper reforms.\n\nMr Li stressed the need to ensure employment. \"Without jobs there will be no source of income and it will be impossible to produce social wealth\", suggesting that despite repeated calls for reform, China's leaders are still preoccupied by any social instability that might come from slower growth.\n\nHe said that China needed to create 10 million urban jobs this year.\n\nNonetheless, the government passed a first test last Friday when it let a corporate bond default, indicating it was ending years of systematically bailing out distressed companies and shifting to more market-oriented policies.\n\nLast week, Shanghai-based Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co said that it was unable to make full bond interest payments of 89.8 million yuan (S$18.5 million) sending it into default. And on Tuesday, power equipment maker Baoding Tianwei Baobian Electric Co, said that its bonds would be suspended from trading after it posted two consecutive years of losses.\n\nThough Mr Li said that he could not possibly \"want to see\" defaults in financial products, he added that \"sometimes certain individual cases of such defaults are hardly avoidable\".\n\nAnalysts see more such defaults in the coming months in sectors with overcapacity, such as steel and mining, as crackdowns on careless loans continue. \"The lack of intervention is consistent with the central Chinese government's adoption of more market-oriented policies, which include increased tolerance for corporate bond defaults, as it reforms the country's financial markets,\" Moody's said in a commentary after the default.\n\nHowever, Mr Li added that authorities have a grip on financial risks to the economy and played down worries over huge debts run up by local governments.\n\nIn late December, China revealed in a long-awaited debt audit that liabilities carried by local governments had ballooned to 17.9 trillion yuan as at the end of June 2013.\n\nThe figure, released by the National Audit Office, compared with 10.7 trillion yuan at the end of 2010 - an increase of 67 per cent, and many analysts say that the figure could actually be much larger.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The matches will be cross-carried on StarHub's platform.\n\nAll 64 of the matches will be free for people who either sign up for - or extend existing - mio TV Gold Pack contracts or standalone Barclays Premier League (BPL) contracts for 24 months.\n\nThe Gold Pack is a combination of entertainment and BPL content on the mio TV platform. The standalone BPL content package is available to both mio TV and StarHub subscribers.\n\nViewers who want a World Cup-only deal will pay a one-time price of $105, excluding GST. This is the most expensive World Cup fee to date - 19 per cent higher than the pre-GST price of $88 and 59 per cent higher than the early-bird price of $66 for the 2010 World Cup.\n\n2014 World Cup pricing for business owners will be announced \"shortly\", the operator said.\n\nIn 2010, the World Cup rights were acquired in a joint bid by mio TV and StarHub. Asked whether SingTel had actively tried to work with StarHub on a joint bid this time, Allen Lew, SingTel country chief officer for Singapore, said: \"Because we had an experience doing it together in 2010 . . . this time, we tried to see whether we could do something.\"\n\n\"We decided that, putting different factors together, it was best to do it on our own.\"\n\nStarHub's Jeannie Ong was less equivocal. \"We made a sincere offer to our competitor for a similar arrangement as the last World Cup,\" Ms Ong, chief marketing officer, said yesterday.\n\n\"A joint bid would have spread the cost of the content and allowed both operators to offer the tournament at a more affordable price. . . Unfortunately, our competitor chose to acquire the rights exclusively.\"\n\nIn response, a SingTel spokeswoman said the joint bid was one of the first options explored, but they were unable to agree on a joint offer that would \"meet the content rights holder's expectations\".\n\nStarHub's Ms Ong also implied that SingTel had overbid for these rights. She said that unlike with the BPL, StarHub will not offer a rebate for the World Cup content that is cross-carried on its platform this time around, as the BPL rebate had \"inadvertently encouraged our competitor to continue making higher exclusive bids . . . We do not support overbidding of content prices by our competitor.\"\n\nSingTel rebutted this claim, saying that they \"negotiated as low a price as we could achieve\". Mr Lew declined to reveal how much the World Cup rights cost. Deloitte had previously estimated that the value of premium sports broadcast rights worldwide would increase 14 per cent to US$24.2 billion this year.\n\nThe purported historical price for World Cup rights has climbed steadily, from the $10 million reportedly paid by StarHub in 2002, to the estimated $15 million in 2006. By 2010, the operators were reportedly asked anywhere from $40 million to $100 million. The final price tag for the 2010 World Cup was said to be about $20 million.\n\nSingTel's 2014 World Cup gambit - the latest in a string of increasingly aggressive moves for football content - will be costly by objective measures, even if it is easily absorbed by the telco giant's bulk.\n\nMarket watchers have long pegged the event as a loss-leader, even with the bump in revenue that it usually produces for the month.\n\nNow, SingTel is promising a plethora of goodies that cost it money - multi-view angles for a match and studio content on the World Cup that it has commissioned a third party to produce here.\n\nAt the same time, it will make key World Cup matches - the opening match, two semi-finals and the final - available on free-to-air channels and on mobile devices, also for free.\n\nmio TV now appears to be forgoing the bulk of the World Cup residential revenue, in order to make it up on revenue from the two-year contracts that it is pushing.\n\nSuch contracts will end at about the same time as SingTel's hold on the current set of BPL rights.\n\n\"If they get an X number of re-contracts or new contracts, that should see them through to the end of their exclusive BPL licence. It's about rebuilding market share,\" said Forrester telco analyst Clement Teo.\n\nWhile StarHub has little to lose with this World Cup move, it must be watching mio TV's trajectory of football domination with apprehension. At the same time, mio TV continues to make significant headway.\n\n\"The (average revenue per user) of mio TV has been increasing quite significantly . . . it shows that we are selling these customers other programmes beyond their basic diet of soccer,\" Mr Lew said yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There are several bitcoin exchanges here, and a burgeoning number of bitcoin vending machines.\n\nFew countries regulate the use or business of bitcoin. In the United States, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network gets bitcoin operators to toe the anti-money-laundering line. In Japan, banks are forbidden from getting involved in bitcoin transactions.\n\nIn recent weeks, Mt Gox - formerly the world's largest bitcoin exchange - has filed for bankruptcy while bitcoin exchange Flexcoin has gone under, undone by hackers.\n\nMAS's move signals a hardening of its position on the cryptocurrency, having evolved from merely cautioning consumers on using bitcoin last June. Now, it will \"consider additional measures\" to tackle the risks posed by bitcoin and its ilk if necessary, it said.\n\nFor now, MAS will not govern the consumer or investor welfare aspect of virtual currencies. \"Investors in virtual currencies will not have the safeguards that investors in securities enjoy,\" it warned.\n\nIn local bitcoin circles, the new rules were largely viewed positively.\n\n\"These rules are great to protect our customers, as well as our industry,\" Antony Lewis, business development manager for local exchange itBit, told The Business Times.\n\nThe exchange has long had its own know-your-customer (KYC) processes. It uses \"banking-level customer identification, including government ID and proof of address which we run through the same databases that banks use\", Mr Lewis added.\n\nAnother exchange, FYB-SG, has been verifying the identity of customers since Oct 18 last year, its founder Luv Khemani said. The exchange had been instructed to do so by MAS, in relation to the Payment Systems (Oversight) Act, which a portion of his business falls under.\n\nWhile bitcoin businesses might be open to scrutiny, many of its users are not, for various reasons. After FYB-SG started verifying identities, trading volumes fell. Volumes have since recovered, but more because of bitcoin's increased adoption rather than the return of its more private customers.\n\nAt itBit, about 50 per cent of its potential customers do not make it through the exchange's KYC process and are turned away, Mr Lewis said.\n\nOver at Coin Republic, David Moskowitz believes that the new rules will slow down the order process for bitcoin brokers. Even so, Coin Republic already requires transactions to be carried out over Internet banking, which is trackable. \"The businesses here are already self-regulating,\" Mr Moskowitz said.\n\nNow, the bitcoin boom in Singapore is in full swing. Coin Republic will launch a bitcoin ATM in a joint venture with Canadian firm Bitcoiniacs this coming Monday at Bartini Kitchen in Boon Tat Street.\n\nThis machine, which will have cash-in and cash-out options, will be capable of checking users' identification documents as well as take a palm-print and photo of the customer if necessary. It is not clear if such features will be available on launch next week.\n\nTwo other bitcoin machine operators - Tembusu Terminals and Bitcoin Exchange - also said that their machines can be customised to comply with KYC requirements.

This was disclosed by the energy giant at its annual investment analysts' meeting at the New York Stock Exchange last week.\n\nThis follows its recent addition of a 220-megawatt plant here (comprising two cogen units of 110 megawatts each) which was part of its massive US$5-6 billion investment in a second petrochemical complex on Jurong Island. This raised its total cogen capacity here to 360 MW of power and 1,650 tonnes per hour of steam - significantly up from an earlier 140 MW cogen facility. EM senior vice-president, Mike Dolan, said at the NYSE briefing that the company was now \"progressing plans\" for its next co-generation project at its Singapore complex.\n\nWhile its two current cogen investments supply utilities to EM's main integrated site here, comprising a refinery and two petrochemical complexes on Jurong Island, BT understands that the planned third cogen facility will be planted on the mainland to cater to its Pioneer Road refinery in Jurong. This was the former Mobil refinery in Jurong which became part of the EM operations following the merger of Exxon (on Pulau Ayer Chawan) with Mobil in 1999.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

It's emotionally gripping stuff, although The Railway Man never takes full advantage of the material at its disposal, moving at a deliberate pace and choosing a more low-key (and possibly duller) route.\n\nThe film begins in 1980, when World War II has been over for 35 years. For Lomax (Colin Firth), however, the war goes on - in his head. Outwardly, he leads a solitary life in Scotland, occupied by books and a near-encyclopaedic knowledge of train timetables.

They include images of Last Supper, the crucifixion of Christ, the birth of Mary and the encounter of Joachim, Mary's father, with the angels.\n\nBut look closely at these paintings and you'll realise the images are not composed of ordinary lines and strokes. Instead, they comprise loops and curls which are the letters of the pallava script, a pre-colonial script used to write Javanese and several other native languages of Indonesia. Each canvas not only illustrates visually an episode of the Old Testament, it also narrates the episode in Javanese language using the pallava script.\n\nDurer was one of the most famous artists of the Renaissance period and a contemporary of Raphael, Michaelangelo and da Vinci. The paintings at Gillman Barracks are near-exact replicas made by award-winning 39-year-old Indonesian artist Eddy Susanto.

The other three stores - Ikea, Giant and Courts - are in Tampines.\n\n\"Big box will mark a major chapter in the growth of TTI when it opens this year,\" said TTI chairman and chief executive officer Sng Sze Hiang at a media briefing yesterday.\n\nThe huge store which will have 400,000 sq ft of retail area and 600,000 sq ft for warehouses and logistic activities, will start business at a time when activity is bustling in the western part of Singapore.\n\nJurong Gateway, the area around the Jurong East MRT station, is gradually turning into a commercial hub with new malls, hospitals, hotel and office space.\n\n\"Collectively, these projects will transform this area into the second Orchard Road,\" says Mr Wong.\n\nThis project has been a long time coming for TTI which has been in the red for three consecutive financial years from 2011 to 2013.\n\nTTI, a global supplier of consumer electronics and known for its Akira line of consumer electronics, was hit hard by the global financial crisis and underwent a financial restructuring that led to a scheme of arrangement with its creditors in 2010.\n\nOwing to the financial woes, construction work on Big Box had to be halted in 2008.\n\nTTI's attempts to revive the project three times between 2010 and 2012 had all suffered a similar fate - they failed.\n\nBut in December 2012, it found a silver lining when two Singapore shareholders - Prima BB, a firm behind the chain of PrimaDeli bakeries, and Utraco Investment, a geotechnical specialist and diversified logistics firm - agreed to take up equity stakes in Big Box.\n\nUtraco owns 30.4 per cent of Big Box while Prima BB holds an 18.6 per cent stake, assuming full exercise of options and preference shares.\n\nMore help came last April when TTI managed to secure a $125 million loan facility which helped kickstart the stalled construction.\n\nNow, there appears to be an air of optimism.\n\n\"We think this project will give us good returns . . . better than all our other investments,\" said Tan Ta Sen, founder of Utraco and Big Box deputy chairman, at the briefing yesterday.\n\nPrimus Cheng, the man at the helm of Prima is even more sanguine: \"We think we can double our investment returns in Big Box very shortly as it's a worthwhile project.\"\n\nThat appears to be a shared confidence. Amid a general market which saw the Straits Times Index shed just over one per cent yesterday, TTI shares jumped 5.5 per cent to end the day at 15.3 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Singapore Exchange (SGX) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore proposed the changes after a penny-stock rout in October erased US$6.9 billion in market value of three companies over three days.\n\n\"More people will leave the industry as they'll get less business,\" Jimmy Ho, president of the Society of Remisiers, said by phone. \"Once they cut the settlement period, there will be less speculative trading and it will drag overall volumes.\"\n\nThe number of stockbrokers in Singapore fell 8.4 per cent to 3,973 at the end of last year from 4,336 in 2011, according to data from the bourse, as the industry was buffeted by declining trading volumes and commissions as well as competition from online trading platforms. The benchmark Straits Times Index trailed all its major developed-market peers in the past 12 months and slid 1.8 per cent this year.\n\nEven after SGX teamed with Singapore Management University and CIMB Group Holdings Bhd in April 2012 to provide training programmes for the industry, traders' ranks continued to thin. This year, the bourse partnered with the National Trades Union Congress's Employment & Employability Institute to bolster interest in the profession.\n\n\"Brokerages are able to cope with fewer dealers because trading volumes are lower,\" Society of Remisiers' Mr Ho said. \"That's a natural adjustment for the industry.\"\n\nIt will be hard to draw young people, given the high risk and low commissions, said Yeo Aiqi, 28, who left Phillip Securities Pte in 2011 after working three years there. \"Stockbroking appears to be a sunset industry,\" Ms Yeo - who now sells women's apparel at her online store at\n\nwww.clothingcandy.com\n\n- said by email. \"Trading volumes are low and commission rates are falling.\"\n\nThe average value of shares traded on the Singapore bourse tumbled 40 per cent to about S$1.06 billion in the first two months of this year from S$1.77 billion a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Transactions in Hong Kong fell 11 per cent in the same period, while those on Japan's Topix index increased 17 per cent.\n\nBlumont Group, Asiasons Capital and LionGold Corp tumbled at least 87 per cent over three days in October, prompting the city-state's central bank and bourse to review its equity market structure. The companies said they didn't know what precipitated the plunges, which spurred at least a dozen lawsuits from banks and brokers seeking to recover losses on collateral held against margin loans.\n\nSGX introduced circuit breakers last month to minimise volatility in share prices and is seeking feedback from the industry before it implements the collateral and settlement period changes.\n\nWhile the move is meant to revive investor confidence, it won't improve the outlook for brokers, said Gabriel Yap, who left the industry in 2009 after 19 years as a trader.\n\n\"The casualties of the penny-stock saga are the stockbrokers,\" Mr Yap, who now manages his own investment advisory firm, said by phone. \"If the clients don't pay, the dealers or the remisiers will have to cover.\" To make the profession more appealing, SGX needs to address dwindling volumes to counter the decline in brokerage commission rates, which have fallen to 0.1 per cent of the value of shares traded from 1 per cent 10 years ago, according to Mr Yap.\n\nStockbrokers are competing against online trading platforms for business. Retail investors in Singapore are increasingly using websites and apps to trade shares amid growing use of mobile gadgets, according to a report by researcher Investment Trends.\n\nSome stockbrokers have given up waiting for an industry revival.\n\n\"The risk to reward just doesn't work out,\" said Chin Chung Hwa, who quit his job as senior vice-president of corporate broking at CIMB Securities Singapore Pte in December. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nMalaysia has not found any evidence yet of illicit chip smuggling, minister says\n\nJul 15, 2025 01:43 PM\n\nNvidia to resume H20 AI chip sales to China in US reversal\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nIndonesia looking at levy on coal exports to boost state coffers\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:03 PM\n\nAsia: Markets mixed as China\u2019s economy meets forecasts\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:49 AM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM", "images": []}

A sister outlet in Simei charged $1.20 more.\n\nThe outlets were top of Case's survey list of 11, all of which were subjects of consumer complaints over stiff price hikes. Six others also raised their prices by more than 41 cents, the amount calculated by the Ministry of Finance as fully passing on the duty hike.\n\nKopitiam's beef was that Case was using outdated data, as its outlets mentioned in the survey have lowered prices since the poll was done between Feb 28 and March 3. The operator also said that its prices during and after the survey were within suppliers' recommended retail prices of $6.20 to $6.80 per bottle.\n\nCase said that while its numbers are no longer current, they were nevertheless accurate and were aimed at helping consumers find value for money.\n\nKopitiam also took umbrage with a subsequent survey of 12 outlets that Case did on Tuesday to \"find out if there were any food and beverage establishments that sold Tiger beer at an equal or cheaper price\". It noted that Case did not update prices for the first group of outlets.\n\n\"This is comparing past price data of our Serangoon and Simei outlets with current price data of the surrounding outlets. This is obviously not comparing apples to apples and presents a grossly inaccurate data comparison to the public and puts our company in a bad position in the media and public's mind.\"\n\nKopitiam also argued that Case failed to record nearby rivals that charged higher than its outlets. \"We have earlier provided you with a receipt for a bottle of Tiger beer retailing at $7.90 at a newly opened outlet but do not know why Case has chosen not to include beer prices which are comparatively higher than our beer prices in your surveys.\"\n\nCase replied that the intention of the second survey was simply to give consumers information about where to find value for money.\n\n\"After our first round of survey of 11 outlets, we are quite concerned with the increase in the beer prices, particularly those that increased by $1 or more which is way above the excise tax. Therefore, in our second round of survey, we intend to find outlets that sell Tiger beer that have price increases that are close to the excise tax increase or below.\n\n\"Hence, we do not look for outlets that have increased way above the excise tax increase. Our intention is to help consumers to look for value for money outlets that offer beer that are priced not too heftily even after the excise tax increase.\"\n\nRegardless of whether price hikes are justified, a higher cost of consuming alcohol is actually a desired outcome for regulators.\n\n\"Our liquor duties are aimed at moderating the consumption of alcohol, given the social costs associated with excessive drinking,\" the finance ministry said on Feb 28.\n\n\"The duties have to be adjusted from time to time to ensure that their effectiveness is preserved. The last effective liquor duties hike was in 2004. The increase of 25 per cent announced in Budget 2014 broadly reverses the decline in the effectiveness of the duties over the past 10 years, as incomes and purchasing power have increased while the liquor duties have remained largely unchanged.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The serious part should never be so serious that it overshadows the fun. I \"collect\" because I enjoy wine. I know of no other reason better than that. I bought more than immediately needed in order to store up for personal enjoyment and for sharing with friends. And like most collectors, I often bought on impulse, or just because I saw the bottle, or perhaps it was the last bottle, or perhaps it was on my list of \"must haves\". It was my good fortune that the 1982 Bordeaux en primeur campaign was announced early in 1983, in the highly respected Decanter, then the only wine magazine available. Further details about the en primeur campaign, in May-June 1983, made it clear that this was a \"must-buy\" period, a \"no-brainer\". You \"ordered\" the cases of wines you wanted, paid for them by the end of the same year (1983), and took delivery in two years' time, ie in spring of 1985.\n\nIn spring of 1983, the wines would have just been put into barrels to mature and you knew that they would spend close to 18-24 months in barrel. I also knew (1) that you should only buy from trustworthy merchants, and (2) you should buy the best.\n\nI also came across The Wine Advocate at the same time - it was then very new, a bi-monthly publication whose first issue was in August 1978. Its May 1983 issue contained a comprehensive review of barrel-samples of the 1982 Bordeaux. I was hooked. Sadly, I did not buy enough. The Firsts were going at \u00a3240 per case, Petrus at \u00a3500 per case. I bought too little.

It made it into the Malacca Strait,\" the senior military officer, who has been briefed on investigations, told Reuters.\n\nThat would appear to rule out sudden catastrophic mechanical failure, as it would mean the plane flew around 500km at least after its last contact with air traffic control, although its transponder and other tracking systems were off.\n\nA non-military source familiar with the investigations said the report was one of several theories and was being checked.\n\nAt the time it lost contact with civilian air traffic control, the plane was roughly midway between Malaysia's east coast town of Kota Bharu and the southern tip of Vietnam, flying at 35,000 ft.\n\nThe Strait of Malacca runs along Malaysia's west coast.\n\nMalaysia's Berita Harian newspaper quoted air force chief Rodzali Daud as saying the plane was last detected at 2.40am by military radar near the island of Pulau Perak at the northern end of the Strait of Malacca. It was flying about 1,000 metres lower than its previous altitude, he was quoted as saying. There was no word on what happened to the plane after this.\n\nThe effect of turning off the transponder is to make the aircraft inert to secondary radar, so civil controllers cannot identify it. Secondary radar interrogates the transponder and gets information about the plane's identity, speed and height.\n\nIt would however still be visible to primary radar, which is used by militaries.\n\nThe fact that at least two passengers on board had used stolen passports has raised suspicions of foul play. But South-east Asia is known as a hub for false documents that are also used by smugglers, illegal migrants and asylum seekers.\n\nInterpol secretary general Ronald Noble named the two men as Iranians aged 18 and 29, who had entered Malaysia using their real passports before using the stolen European documents to board the Beijing-bound flight. \"The more information we get, the more we are inclined to conclude it is not a terrorist incident,\" Mr Noble said.\n\nMalaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said the younger man appeared to be an illegal immigrant. His mother was waiting for him in Frankfurt and had been in contact with the authorities, he said. \"We believe he is not likely to be a member of any terrorist group, and we believe he was trying to emigrate to Germany,\" Mr Khalid said.\n\nBoth men entered Malaysia on Feb 28, at least one from Phuket, eight days before boarding the flight to Beijing, Malaysian immigration chief Aloyah Mamat said. Both held onward reservations to Western Europe. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

The SFMP aims to give a majority of Singaporeans access to sports and recreational facilities within a 10-minute walk of their homes. Among the new projects in the pipeline are a regional sports centre in Punggol, which will be integrated with Punggol's waterways and co-located with a Safra clubhouse.\n\nResidents in Sembawang will get a new town sports and recreation centre that will be part of a future one-stop community hub, said Acting Culture, Community and Youth Minister Lawrence Wong in Parliament yesterday. The existing Ang Mo Kio Swimming Complex will be redeveloped, while new sporting spaces such as sheltered playing arenas and multi-use courts will be created in various HDB estates, starting with a pilot launch in Jurong Spring and Boon Lay.\n\nMr Wong also revealed plans to help Singapore's athletes who want to pursue their sporting goals but remain concerned about their long-term career prospects after retiring from sports. A new career scheme has been started to rope in companies that are willing to hire athletes and provide flexible workplace arrangements for their training. Major employers such as Resorts World Sentosa and StarHub are already on board, said Mr Wong. \"These companies also see the broader corporate benefits of being associated with sports, and having the athletes as their brand ambassadors.\"\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

Several factors have given rise to cost pressures in the sector and made financing more costly and less accessible, industry players say, and this situation is likely to persist in the near future.\n\n\"Shipping is a volatile business defined by changing market demands, freight rates and bunker costs (etc),\" Erik-Jan Bakker, vice-president of sales in Asia at Astrium, told The Business Times. \"The shipping industry has gone through tough times during recent years and the improvements that have been seen over the past six months are still preliminary and scattered.\"\n\nIndustry observers say the situation has not changed much and some of these factors are likely to erode hopes of a major recovery in the near future. Peter Sand, chief shipping analyst at Bimco in Denmark, said: \"Shipowners and operators face multiple cost pressures in today's markets: high bunker prices, low freight rates and regulatory issues that require investments or higher costs going forward.\"\n\nThese investments to comply with regulatory changes include new ballast water treatment systems, in keeping with an International Maritime Organization (IMO) convention that requires all new vessels constructed after December 2013 to have a new water management system. There is also a separate IMO rule on stricter requirements for bunker fuel inside vessels' designated emission control areas (ECAs) from Jan 1, 2015, so that there will be lower sulphur levels in the ECAs, Mr Sand told BT.\n\nRoberto Cazzulo, chairman of RINA Services and the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) Council in Italy, noted that there were three main factors that are intensifying cost pressures on shipowners - overcapacity, low freight rates and high bunker prices.\n\nBecause of rising costs, many shipping companies have been operating at rates under their operational cost levels, and this has driven some to the edge and beyond, said Mr Bakker. \"Investments have been written off faster than ever before as new ships' designs operate in a more efficient way or with substantially increased capacity.\"\n\nHe cited bunker and labour as the prime contributors to rising operational costs. \"Bunker is obviously a significant portion of the operational cost picture, which is driving an increasing focus on green and smart shipping. Another main operational cost driver is the crew.\"\n\nHe noted that as the pool of available crew was shrinking, they have developed greater bargaining power. This, he added, makes it essential for shipowners and operators to create a better working environment and remuneration package to attract the right crew for their vessels.\n\nEven as an improving global economy offers a glimmer of hope to the industry, conditions may not return to pre-crisis levels yet. Mr Cazzulo said: \"There are some signs of global economic recovery and upturns. But there is still an oversupply imbalance, for some ship types, combined with high fuel costs. These are the main drivers.\"\n\nMr Bakker added: \"The cost pressures have been developing since 2008 and are fairly constant. There are changes in terms of size and importance of the cost pressures, but it is wishful thinking of shipowners who think that all will go back to the situation of before 2008.\"\n\nMr Cazzulo also warned that \"shipping financing will remain tight\" as a result of the high-cost environment.\n\nSome regulatory factors in the financial sector have led to a tighter and more expensive financing environment. Mr Sand said: \"Moreover, the financial pressure is also felt in the industry with incoming Basel III requirements making bank financing more expensive and alternative sources of finance in general having more strings attached and coming at a higher price.\"\n\nHe added that with the global economic crisis easing and more normal conditions in the shipping market, financial costs should come down, but warned that such improvements may be marginal. \"With regard to financial costs, I don't think that we will ever see such strong shipping finance markets as we saw in 2007/2008.\"\n\nWith cost pressures and financing challenges here to stay for a while, shipowners are increasingly turning their attention to technology and operational efficiency to ride out choppy waters.\n\n\"In this scenario,\" Mr Cazzulo noted, \"ship energy efficiency will be a must, not only for complying with regulations but for (also) getting a better competitive position in the market.\"\n\nMr Bakker said shipowners are focusing more on initiatives to reduce operational costs, including some pre-emptive measures to address future cost increases. \"It is important for shipowners to embrace the trend of technological improvement and getting more efficiency out of their operationally spent or opex dollar. Fuel efficiency is not only a key to cutting cost; it will have an important spin-off in the area of green shipping, which will avoid potential increased cost caused by carbon taxes.\"\n\nHe suggested that vessel owners look into investing in their manpower and improving compliance. He explained: \"Investment in your crew means that your investment (in your ship) is better taken care off. A happy and returning crew member will help run your vessel in a more efficient manner, creating loyalty to your operations and as a result of that, long-term benefits for your company. Compliance with regulations will avoid unnecessary cost of fines or delays.\"\n\nAccording to Mr Sand, to pursue fuel efficiency, equipment could be retrofitted across the vessel. \"(This is) all done to reduce fuel consumption. These initiatives include underwater hull polishing, propeller polishing, boss-cap fin, changing the hull painting and so on. In the engine room, we have turbo cut-offs and general de-rating of the engines as well as multiple other smaller but effective changes such as slide valves.\"\n\nMr Cazzulo added that shipowners find it worthwhile to retrofit some of this productive equipment into their vessels \"if they prove to cut even small percentages of running costs\".\n\nMr Bakker said: \"More and more shipowners understand how significant cost savings can be achieved by measures such as smart routing, use of weather forecasting, engine optimisation, monitoring . . . They achieve this by investing in tools that work on board and on shore.\"\n\nWhile noting that shipping companies are adopting a more customised approach to using technology to address cost issues, he said firms would have to ensure a stronger connection between the ship and an operations centre on shore to achieve more seamless productivity gains.\n\n\"We see many different initiatives being taken by different shipping companies. These range from having an office-like IT environment on board with connections to shore via, (for example), Lync or other applications, to remote engine monitoring, which allows for shore-based specialists with a wider access to information to advise the captain to change the trim of the vessel. Other well-known and often applied measures are using route optimisation applications based on weather and current information.\"\n\nIt appears that technology is likely to play a key role for shipping companies navigating the high-cost environment, and the horizon appears bright for such technology and automation providers.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Bankers who want to move to Asia for money will be better off in Hong Kong.\"\n\nHong Kong's income tax is 17 per cent.\n\nNoting that the UK's 45 per cent income tax rate takes some lustre off the fat bonuses, they added: \"However, assuming that the entirety of bankers' bonuses are taxed at the higher rate, our figures suggest that net UK average bonuses (US$54,000) still remain twice as high as the average post-tax bonus paid to Hong Kong finance staff (US$27,000). Maybe London bankers aren't doing so badly after all.\"\n\nThe eFinancialCareers survey, conducted between January and February, polled 2,692 employed bankers and finance professionals who were bonus-eligible and knew how much they were getting in their bonuses. Of the number, 582 respondents were based here.\n\nFour in 10 (42 per cent) here reported that their bonus was bigger than the previous year's; 28 per cent said it was the same and 18 per cent said their bonus had shrunk.\n\nGeorge McFerran, sales and marketing director at eFinancialCareers, said: \"It's been widely reported that the overall bonus pool was slightly down from last year's, but eFinancialCareers data shows that four in 10 got bigger bonuses. This indicates that companies are dividing the bonus pool more ruthlessly than in previous years, giving priority to rewarding top performers.\"\n\nThe much smaller bonuses paid here, relative to that in other financial centres, can be partly attributed to Singapore being the workhorse for the industry; the big deals or transactions are done elsewhere.\n\nMr McFerran, linking the lower bonuses here to Singapore's being a traditional hotspot for operational functions, noted that the UK, US or Hong Kong respondents were front-office staff - \"the investment bankers, people whose roles get larger bonuses\".\n\nThat said, front-office folks in Singapore have not fared that well either.\n\nFarida Charania, chief executive officer for banking and finance at Singapore-based search firm Nastrac Group, said: \"Bonuses for excellent performers have been flat and those for normal performers have been significantly below the previous year.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Traditional approaches have centred around education and disclosure, based on the assumptions that: a) retail investors are relatively unsophisticated and b) that institutions typically possess unfair technological and economies of scale advantages over small players and that the playing field can be levelled through enhanced disclosure.\n\nOver the years, this strategy has yielded mixed results. Retail involvement has been patchy and subject to booms and busts, the former usually in low-priced issues and the latter, when they occur, hurting confidence and leading to retail withdrawal and abstinence.\n\nToday, after several months of decline, retail participation is very low. Two reasons have been identified. First, the US Federal Reserve's tapering of its monetary stimulus that has resulted in a capital flight out of Asia back to the West, draining liquidity out of the market.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Columns\n\nAnother moon landing will take more than rocket science\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nSingapore\u2019s new grant signals the need to adapt to tariffs, not just ride them out\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nEroding US exceptionalism will impact world economy\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nBye-bye America First?\n\nJul 15, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n4\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\n5\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal", "images": []}

The firm, which derives more than 90 per cent of its income from real estate, will set up an international school, a local one and a pre-school to sweeten the proposition of its two major residential property projects Star City and Pun Hlaing Golf Estate in Yangon.\n\n\"Our real estate will see a significant increase in demand and prices which are directly related to our investments in schools. We expect a return on investment of between 15 per cent and 30 per cent,\" said Yoma's executive chairman and Myanmese tycoon, Serge Pun, at a press briefing here yesterday.\n\nYoma, together with Education Index Management, will develop an international school for about US$40 million which will be overseen by Dulwich College International with Dulwich College in London as educational adviser.\n\nIt also plans to build a local school through a tie-up with a local firm which would cost some US$12 million. These schools will be located adjacent to the group's Star City residential project.\n\nIn addition, Yoma is partnering UK's Harrow International Management Services to build an early years centre on a 1.6 ha site (four acres) in the group's flagship upmarket Pun Hlaing Golf Estate residential project,\n\nIn the agriculture space, the group has embarked on the coffee business, a sector bursting with potential, according to Yoma's chief executive, Andrew Rickards.\n\n\"Myanmar falls squarely within the coffee belt of the world yet its coffee is not on the world stage. So, we found the biggest coffee plantation in the country which could start a new trend,\" Mr Rickards enthused.\n\nYoma inked a conditional pact with ED&F Man (EDFM) Holdings, one of the world's biggest traders of soft commodities, to plant close to 1,500 hectares of robusta coffee at Yoma's Maw Tin Estate in the Ayeyarwaddy region.\n\nYoma and EDFM will have an 85-15 per cent share respectively in the coffee business which would need US$20 million investments over four years.\n\nYoma has also tied up with local partners to invest up to US$46 million over the next five years to supply UHT dairy products to the local market. Yoma will hold a 40 per cent share in this business.\n\nThere's some heart behind this commercial strategy as the group hopes to increase the milk supplied free to school children by the Myanmar government from merely 45,000 packs a day now to 1.5 million packs eventually.\n\n\"This project is socially significant, economically viable and, therefore, sustainable and that's why it excites me,\" said Mr Pun, a straight-talking 61-year old mogul who is a Singapore permanent resident.\n\nTo set up cold storage and logistics facilities for up to US$12 million in Myanmar, Yoma sealed an understanding with Kokubu, one of Japan's largest food distributors and First Myanmar Investment Co (FMI).\n\nThe agriculture businesses and a commercial vehicle-leasing business will be transferred to the newly set up Yoma Agricultural & Logistics Holding (YALH).\n\nThe World Bank's International Finance Corp will provide debt and equity financing to Yoma to develop its agriculture and logistics business and will also invest up to 20 per cent equity in YALH.\n\nThere was also news on the real estate front with Yoma joining hands with FMI - Mr Pun is controlling shareholder of both firms - to develop two plots of land at FMI City in Yangon.\n\nThese big steps signal the group's strategy to balance its income stream.\n\n\"Real estate will always be a pillar of our business and it's not easy to dethrone it as it's so big,\" said Mr Pun. \"The ideal is for us to have half our income stream from real estate and the other half from other businesses.\"\n\nYoma shares rose one cent or 1.4 per cent to 72 cents yesterday on news of these developments.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/transport-logistics/boeing-shares-dip-missing-plane-adds-b787-worry", "site_title": "Boeing shares dip as missing plane adds to B787 worry", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nBoeing shares dip as missing plane adds to B787 worry\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Mar 11, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[DALLAS] Boeing Co shares fell after the company said that it would inspect wings for cracks on undelivered 787s, and investigators searched for a Malaysian Airline System Bhd (MAS) B777 jetliner that vanished four days ago.\n\n\"News of the wing and inspections likely lower first quarter deliveries, plus the 777 aircraft incident in Asia will likely weigh on the Boeing stock this week,\" said Peter Arment, an analyst at Sterne, Agee & Leach Inc.\n\nBoeing declined 1.3 per cent to US$126.89 at the close in New York. The shares have risen 56 per cent in the past year, compared with a 21 per cent increase in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.\n\nBoeing is inspecting 43 Dreamliners for hairline cracks after it was notified by supplier Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd that a manufacturing change may have caused structural damage to the jets' composite wings. Inspection and repairs may take as much as two weeks per aircraft, Mr Arment said, reducing Boeing's first-quarter jet delivery tally and revenues.\n\nThe issue, discovered in mid-February, does not affect planes already in service and should prove a short-term hiccup for the world's largest planemaker, Cai von Rumohr, an aerospace analyst with Cowen & Co, said in a note to clients on Monday. After delivering just four Dreamliners in February, Boeing should regain some momentum in March, he said, while probably falling short of the 20 that he anticipated for the first quarter.\n\n\"While a disappointing surprise, the 787 wing issue announced last Friday looks like a minor speed bump that should be fully resolved by mid-year with negligible impact on full-year results,\" said Mr von Rumohr, who rates Boeing the equivalent of a \"buy\" and lists the stock as one of his top three picks.\n\nNone of the 30 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg have a \"sell\" rating on the stock, and 22 recommend buying the shares while eight say \"hold\".\n\nBoeing is getting a handle on production snarls at a second 787 assembly line North Charleston, South Carolina, that have also slowed deliveries to a crawl, Dennis Muilenburg, president and chief operating officer of the Chicago-based planemaker, said on Monday at a conference sponsored by JP Morgan Chase & Co.\n\nBoeing handed off a total of eight 787s during the first two months of 2014, below its new 10-per-month goal. The planemaker is seeing progress after hiring 300 workers to tackle issues with slow and unfinished work on centre fuselages at the factory, Mr Muilenburg said.\n\n\"Any way you want to measure factory operations - jobs behind schedule, unit cost, part shortages - all of those are trending in the right direction,\" he added. \"So I think we have our arms well around that interruption, and we expect to see Charleston operating very efficiently going forward.\"\n\nNine countries are investigating the disappearance of a Boeing 777-200 on March 8 that was flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 227 passengers and 12 crew members. A Boeing team is providing technical assistance to US accident investigators in the region, the company said on Monday.\n\nThe B777 has one of the best safety records of any plane. In its 19-year history, it has had only one fatal accident, that of an Asiana Airlines Inc plane that crashed while landing in San Francisco last year, killing three people. In that case, investigators have focused on pilot error.\n\n\"This 777 is arguably one of the most reliable airplanes ever built and its record proves it,\" said John Goglia, a former member of the US National Transportation Safety Board, in an interview on Bloomberg Television's First Up. \"This airplane has a very, very secure and robust platform so that would be the last place that I would think\" to look for a cause for a crash.\n\nThe plane that disappeared last weekend shattered a wing tip after colliding with another aircraft at Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Aug 9, 2012, NBC News reported, citing a report by the Bureau d'Enquetes et d'Analyses pour la securite de l'aviation civile (BEA).\n\n\"The aircraft had a clipped wing tip,\" MAS chief executive officer Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said in response to the reported incident. \"It was repaired by Boeing, cleared by Boeing. It was safe to fly.\"\n\nWhile there is no indication that a wing issue contributed to the disappearance, aircraft structural repairs have failed before and caused accidents.\n\nAfter a Taiwanese China Airlines Ltd 747 crashed into the Taiwan Strait on May 25, 2002, investigators found that a repair on the plane's tail had failed, causing it to break apart, according to the Taiwan Aviation Safety Council. All 225 people aboard the Taipei to Hong Kong flight died. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

Since then, it has continued to muddle along rather than accelerate. Indeed, latest figures show that gross domestic product (GDP) grew at just a 2.4 per cent annual pace in the fourth quarter of last year, revised down from 3.2 per cent originally reported, and much lower than the 4.1 per cent growth in Q3 2013. Some observers are blaming the unusual cold weather for the disappointing growth numbers, as Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen has suggested. But more likely, those numbers reflect the fall in government spending and the continuing weakness in the housing market. And while consumer spending and exports were increasing at the end of the last year, the performance fell below initial expectations.\n\nHence consumer spending grew at a 2.6 per cent annual rate in Q4, down from an earlier 3.3 per cent estimate, the Commerce Department said. And exports grew at a 9.4 per cent annual pace, lower than the 11.4 per cent rate reported in January. Overall, the US economy would probably continue to grow at a 2 per cent or even lower annual growth this year. And according to recent forecasts issued by the bipartisan US Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the economy could remain in sluggish conditions for quite a while yet. Hence the CBO economists are predicting a prolonged period during which US GDP will grow at a low average rate of 2.1 per cent.\n\nAt the same time, with American companies not ready to make new investments, there is probably not going to be major improvements in the job market. Indeed, according to the CBO, job growth will average less than 70,000 a month from 2019 till 2024. This and other economic forecasts may leave the US central bank with no other choice but to reassess its current plan to discontinue its aggressive monetary strategy aka quantitative easing (QE). The Fed has already started unwinding or tapering a programme that has expanded its balance sheet to more than US$4 trillion. It has begun cutting its massive bond purchases, creating expectations that it will wrap up QE by the end of 2014.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nAnother moon landing will take more than rocket science\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nSingapore\u2019s new grant signals the need to adapt to tariffs, not just ride them out\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nEroding US exceptionalism will impact world economy\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nBye-bye America First?\n\nJul 15, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/airlines-need-think-out-box", "site_title": "Airlines need to think out of the box", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nAirlines need to think out of the box\n\nListen to this article\n\nPublished Tue, Mar 11, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWHILE the search goes on for the wreckage of the Malaysia Airlines plane that vanished en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur, one needs to keep in mind that more than eight million people fly every day and, while even one plane accident is one too many, statistics show it's still safer to fly than to cross the road in a busy city.\n\nThere's an urgent need to find out what happened to the MH370 Boeing 777-200, not only to bring closure for the grieving relatives but also to understand the cause of the plane's disappearance. For this reason, the major focus of the search effort would be to retrieve the plane's \"black box\" or flight recorder. The black box, which actually is bright orange in colour, records vital flight data and is designed to survive a crash. It is an invaluable source of information in case something goes wrong. For example, initially it was thought that the Air France Airbus A330 accident over the Atlantic Ocean in 2009 was due to a mechanical fault in the plane. However, after its black box was recovered from 4km under the sea following a two-year search, its data showed that the accident was not due to a technical fault in the aircraft. The biggest disadvantage of a black box is that it can be accessed only after finding the crash site. This can be a major challenge if the plane crashes into water. With more people flying every day, airlines and international bodies such as the International Air Transport Association need to explore alternatives to the black box. Modern planes allow passengers to surf the Internet at near-broadband speeds 35,000 feet in the air via satellites, and yet there is no system in place to stream vital flight data to receiving stations on the ground. The technology exists to allow this to be done relatively easily.\n\nIn the case of the MH370 accident, if investigators and rescue teams had access to the telemetry data of the plane until the time it disappeared, they would have found the wreckage by now. When a plane flies over land, it's usually always within the radar range of either the air traffic controllers at various airports along the route or other installations such as military radar. However, when a plane flies over water, particularly in areas several hundred kilometres from land, it is very much on its own. This explains why it is so difficult to find a crash site if a plane goes down over water.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nAnother moon landing will take more than rocket science\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nSingapore\u2019s new grant signals the need to adapt to tariffs, not just ride them out\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nEroding US exceptionalism will impact world economy\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nBye-bye America First?\n\nJul 15, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

More than 77,000 BTO flats have been launched in the past three years, of which 14,000 units were completed last year; 28,000 units will be handed over this year.\n\nThe tightening of the property market here has already led some Singaporeans to look for foreign properties.\n\nMr Khaw counselled caution, as there are added risks and complexities arising from different legal and regulatory frameworks operating outside Singapore.\n\nThe CEA will launch an online guide for those thinking of buying a foreign property. It will also step up its effort to regulate estate agents marketing overseas property developments here.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Industry groups say reaching a target of 24 million tourists by 2021 would add 9 percentage points to gross domestic product and create 300,000 jobs. Tourism accounts for more than 16 per cent of Greece's GDP, one of the highest levels in Europe.\n\nHellenic Seaplanes is betting that continued growth in tourist visits, which the Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises estimates will total as many as 18.5 million this year, will fuel revenue for seaplane operators, Mr Charalambous said. The company wants to build as many water aerodromes as possible before the peak summer season and expects to have 112 by the end of 2015.\n\nInvestment from tourism companies like Hellenic Seaplanes could help create new niche markets, spark growth and development on islands and in ports and create jobs, while boosting the real-estate market, he said.\n\nThe Greek government has agreed to speed up licensing to allow flights to start before the summer, Environment Minister Yiannis Maniatis said on Feb 18, citing the industry's potential role in boosting tourism.\n\nMr Charalambous's company wants to \"act as a feeder\" to carriers such as International Consolidated Airlines Group's British Airways and Aegean Airlines, he said. Code-sharing could allow passengers to \"buy a ticket from anywhere in the world to a Greek airport, and then onward to water aerodromes on islands we serve.\"\n\nHellenic Seaplanes has secured 16.5 million euros from US and European private equity funds to finance plans to buy or lease 20 new planes, Mr Charalambous said. The company wants to work with a fund that \"knows the seaplane business\", he said.\n\nBlackstone Group last year bought a controlling stake in Maldivian Air Taxi and Trans Maldivian Airways, who together operate the world's largest seaplane fleet.\n\nHellenic Seaplanes has approval to operate between the popular Ionian Sea island of Zakinthos, the western port of Patras, the north-western island of Corfu and the central port of Volos, serving neighbouring islands including Skopelos, the setting for the film Mamma Mia. Hellenic Seaplanes also plans to offer sightseeing flights, resort transfers and cargo services, Mr Charalambous said. Seaplanes can also be used as ambulances to bring patients from remote islands to larger facilities.\n\nThe company is in contact with cruise and tour operators for possible deals on sightseeing flights, Mr Charalambous said. In cargo, it's working on a partnership with DHL Worldwide Express and is talking to Interamerican, Greece's biggest health insurer, about medical evacuation operations.\n\nHellenic Seaplanes will reply to a state asset-sales fund invitation to investors to express interest in building a water- airport hub in the Athens suburb of Paleo Faliro, he said.\n\nThe carrier will target Cyprus after Greece, focusing on operations \"in parallel with the planned development of casinos\", Mr Charalambous said. \"We could connect Cyprus with neighbouring Lebanon and even Egypt to carry potential casino clients.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

The vessel started loading crude late at night, oil officials said.\n\nThe oil dispute is just one facet of the deepening turmoil in the North African Opec member, where the government is struggling to control militias who helped topple Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 but kept their weapons and now challenge state authority.\n\nA local television station controlled by protesters showed footage of pro-autonomy rebels holding a lengthy ceremony and slaughtering a camel to celebrate their first oil shipment. In the distance stood a tanker. The station said the ceremony took place in Es Sider.\n\nPrime Minister Ali Zeidan appeared on television to warn the tanker's crew. \"The tanker will be bombed if it doesn't follow orders when leaving (the port). This will be an environmental disaster,\" Mr Zeidan said. \"They are now trying to load oil,\" he said, denouncing it as a criminal act. Authorities have ordered the arrest of the tanker's crew.\n\nThere was no immediate sign of the country's armed forces moving towards the port. Analysts say the military, still in training, would struggle to overcome rebels battle-hardened from the eight-month uprising against Gaddafi.\n\nMr Zeidan acknowledged the army had failed to implement his orders last week to stop the protesters sending reinforcements from their base in Ajdabiyah, west of the regional capital Benghazi, to Es Sider.\n\n\"Nothing was done,\" Mr Zeidan said, adding that political opponents in parliament were obstructing his government. He said North Korea had asked the ship's captain to sail away from the port but armed protesters had prevented that.\n\nAbb-Rabbo Albarassi, the eastern autonomy movement's self-declared prime minister, said Mr Zeidan's government had failed to meet its demands to share oil wealth, investigate oil corruption and to grant regional autonomy.\n\n\"We tried to reach a deal with the government, but they and parliament . . . were too busy with themselves and didn't even discuss our demands,\" he told the televised ceremony. \"If anyone attacks, we will respond to that.\"\n\nA successful independent oil shipment would be a blow to the government. Tripoli had said earlier it would destroy tankers trying to buy oil from Ibrahim Jathran, a former anti-Gaddafi rebel who seized the port and two others with thousands of his men in August.\n\nMr Jathran, who was seen attending the televised ceremony, had commanded a brigade of former rebels paid by the state to protect petroleum facilities.

He expects mortgage margins to increase this year.\n\nGetin Noble paid 275 basis points more than the six-month Warsaw Interbank Offered Rate, or an equivalent of 5.46 per cent, to sell 24.3 million zloty of seven-year floating-rate notes in December, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nThat was 26 basis points more than the average mortgage rate that month.\n\nLenders charged 13.2 per cent on average for consumer loans in January, according to data from the central bank.\n\nWarsaw-based Getin Noble plans to cut home-loan sales to less than 150 million zloty a month this year, down from about 250 million zloty last year and as much as 800 million zloty during the peak in 2011, Mr Rosinski said.\n\nPKO Bank Polski SA, Poland's largest lender, has no intention of growing its 28 to 30 per cent share of the home-loan market, according to Wojciech Werochowski, head of retail client financing at the bank.\n\nPKO sold 11 billion zloty of new home loans last year, he said.\n\n\"In the past months, we've been seeing margins increasing\" for home loans, Mr Werochowski said on Friday. \"I'd expect further moves in this direction.\"\n\nDeutsche Bank AG's Polish unit sees mortgage rates stabilising in the first half, according to Agnieszka Pilarek, head of the mortgage banking department at the bank. Costs may rise in the second half of the year following a central bank increase in interest rates, she said.\n\nPolish policymakers extended their pledge last week to keep the benchmark rate at a record low of 2.5 per cent until at least the end of September.\n\nThe zloty declined 1.1 per cent against the euro last week, paring a 2.3 per cent advance in February, the second-biggest gain among 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg after the Indonesian rupiah.\n\nWhile banks such as PKO and Getin Noble rein in their mortgage businesses, Alior Bank SA sees opportunity for growth.\n\nMortgages are a \"good, safe and profitable product for banks with relatively low capital costs\", chief executive Wojciech Sobieraj said last week.\n\nAlior raised 464 million zloty from the sale of new shares in December. Revenue jumped 29 per cent last year, according to a regulatory filing on March 6.\n\nMost Polish banks fund their lending mainly with deposits.\n\nWhile as much as 81 per cent of deposits mature in less than two years, about half of home loans are due in 20 years or more, leaving banks vulnerable to changes in short-term borrowing costs, according to data from the financial market regulator.\n\nThe yield on Poland's 10-year bond fell 11 basis points to 4.28 per cent last week, narrowing the premium with German bunds to 263 basis points and down from 308 basis points on Jan 31.\n\nPoland is considering revamping regulations governing mortgage-backed securities to increase access to longer-term financing, according to a government proposal published in January. The plan still awaits government acceptance and approval by the parliament.\n\nSelling asset-backed securities is \"the simplest and cheapest funding for longer-term mortgages\", Dariusz Gorski, an analyst at Bank Zachodni WBK SA in Warsaw, said. Until they are in place, there will be limited interest in expanding home loans, he said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

Good reputation draws customers, repeated purchases and favourable treatment by suppliers, bankers, the media and investors.\n\nMany factors can contribute to the accumulation of corporate reputation over time: customer satisfaction, quality of products and services, corporate culture, management and staff expertise, brand positioning, advertising, public relations, corporate social responsibility programmes, etc.\n\nAnother key factor is corporate governance, even though it is more often thought of as a regulatory necessity.\n\nIn essence, corporate governance is the process by which companies are made accountable to its stakeholders. A good board provides the oversight of a company's strategy, organisation and operations to ensure that it will deliver high customer satisfaction, good quality of products and services, and so on - the factors that contribute to corporate reputation.\n\nSeveral studies show that stakeholders rate corporate governance as a key driver of corporate reputation.\n\nA recent study by the University of Illinois, The Reputational Impact of Corporate Governance, concluded that governance choices affect reputations. Poison pills were highlighted as being particularly negative in their impact on manager reputation.\n\nAn Italian study, Exploring the Drivers of Corporate Reputation, found that the higher the perceived quality of financial disclosure or quality of governance structures of a company, the more favourable the disposition of securities analysts towards the company.\n\nGiven the strong linkage between corporate governance and corporate reputation, companies can turn good corporate governance structures into a competitive advantage.\n\nThe means to amplifying corporate reputation from a company's corporate governance structures and practices is marketing.\n\nMarketing functions on all levels of an organisation but is especially applied to products and services due to its direct impact on revenue and profits.\n\nMarket corporate governance\n\nMarketing corporate governance is different from the traditional marketing of products and services and the company's brand. It transcends the audio-visual components of corporate logos, colour schemes, print ads and TV commercials, and relationship programmes with customers, suppliers and other stakeholders.\n\nThe starting point should entail forming a cross-functional team, preferably led by the chief executive of the corporation and supported by the marketing communications group. The board should be involved or at least updated on all plans and efforts.\n\nAn analysis should then be conducted on the company's strengths and areas for improvement, in both its corporate governance structures and related marketing initiatives; a plan is then drawn up for implementation.\n\nPeer comparisons are helpful in identifying what can be done. Increasingly, there are comparative studies and corporate governance rankings. In Singapore, the annual Governance & Transparency Index prepared by the NUS Centre for Governance, Institutions and Organisations (CGIO), in partnership with CPA Australia and The Business Times, assesses the financial transparency of listed companies based on their annual announcements.\n\nSID is currently working with the Monetary Authority of Singapore and CGIO on an Asean-wide Corporate Governance Scorecard based on OECD principles.\n\nIn addition to these multi-company comparisons, a company could identify a role-model entity, preferably in the same or related industry, that exemplifies a strong corporate reputation and corporate governance. Their best practices and measurable components should be studied, and the similarities and gaps between the company and its role model drawn out.\n\nThe initiatives to close or improve on gaps, and to build upon the strengths of the company, can then be drawn up.\n\nTo operationalise the action points, the marketing and communications team needs to craft necessary corporate governance messages, appropriately contextualised for each stakeholder group. Right marketing and communication channels need to be put in place.\n\nTo ensure that the efforts yield improvements in reputation, they need to be measured, analysed and refined. As the management adage goes, \"what gets measured gets done\". This is why periodic reviews are needed.\n\nArticulating its corporate governance policy and structure can help companies in building up a strong foundation to proactively market the fact that its board and management are accountable to its corporate governance policy, and in acting upon it. This will earn them a strong corporate reputation over time.\n\nDr Wilson Chew is a Member of the Governing Council of the Singapore Institute of Directors\n\nFor more articles, go to\n\nbtd.sg/BMatters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nMalaysia has not found any evidence yet of illicit chip smuggling, minister says\n\nJul 15, 2025 01:43 PM\n\nNvidia to resume H20 AI chip sales to China in US reversal\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nIndonesia looking at levy on coal exports to boost state coffers\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:03 PM\n\nAsia: Markets mixed as China\u2019s economy meets forecasts\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:49 AM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM", "images": []}

They are the worst for women's rights among airlines,\" said Gabriel Mocho, civil aviation secretary at the international grouping of transport unions.\n\nA Swedish newspaper last year published a report entitled \"The truth about the luxury of Qatar Airways\", which described restrictions imposed on cabin crew.\n\nAt the ITB travel fair in Berlin, Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar al Baker condemned the article and said that people were attacking Qatar because it had won the right to host the 2022 soccer World Cup.\n\nQatar has been criticised for its treatment of migrant workers helping build facilities for the World Cup. \"All this was a big sensational (effort) to target my country because of 2022, saying people have no human rights. It is not true,\" he told reporters.\n\nQatar Airways contracts forbid any member of the cabin crew, the vast majority of whom are female, from marrying during the first five years of their employment with the firm. \"You know they have come to do a job and we make sure that they are doing a job, that they give us a good return on our investment,\" Mr Al Baker said.\n\nHe also said that Qatar Airways made no secret of the conditions to employees, and provided them with a document stating the terms and conditions of their employment. \"If you come to seek employment with Qatar Airways, we give you a document that these are the rules and regulations - if you as a mature individual accept those conditions, then you shouldn't complain.\"\n\nHe said that because local regulations prevented pregnant cabin crew from flying and the company did not have many ground jobs available for them, pregnant women must often leave. \"We are not in the business where we can guarantee ground jobs or let people stay away . . . and don't do anything for the airline,\" he said.\n\nCabin crew across the world may not work on board airplanes once pregnant due to health concerns, although some countries allow them to work for up to three months into the pregnancy.\n\nMost airlines then find them work on the ground or put them on maternity leave. In Europe, pregnant women are protected from being fired or made redundant.\n\nEmirates said that it has a policy whereby female cabin crew who become pregnant in the first three years have to leave. \"If you are hired by Emirates as a cabin crew, during the first three years we expect you to fly,\" chief commercial officer Thierry Antinori said.\n\nCabin crew who have been employed for more than three years have the option of taking paid maternity leave.\n\nMr Antinori and Mr Al Baker highlighted the other benefits offered to employees, such as tax-free income and paid-for accommodation. Mr Antinori, a French native who previously worked for German carrier Lufthansa, also said that Emirates offered profit-sharing schemes. \"Last year, we had 129,000 applications for cabin crew at Emirates. I do not think these are conditions that are making people reluctant to work for us,\" he said.\n\nMr Al Baker said that Qatar Airways was recruiting 250 to 300 cabin crew every month, and that each open recruitment session saw around 800 to 2,500 candidates.\n\nBack in the 1970s and 1980s, sexism in the industry was a common issue, especially towards cabin crew, but the ITF said that such times were long past. \"You can't see that deep level of sexism anywhere now except at these airlines in the Gulf,\" Mr Mocho said. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

This was as originally discussed with the government. A \"significant majority\" of members at a dialogue on Wednesday supported the move, acting general manager Desmond Tay said in a March 8 newsletter. The general committee will accept the government's Feb 21 offer, he said.\n\nMembers who still prefer the Island location be reconfigured for public use instead of Bukit can exercise their rights under the club's constitution by March 25 so the club can submit an alternative proposal by end-March, he said.\n\nThe government had offered SICC a choice after some members asked if the original arrangement could be swapped. But consensus seems to be that one of two courses at the Bukit site should be opened up, instead of one at Island, which also has two 18-hole courses.\n\nLawyer and SICC member Thomas Lee said the decision to hold on to the Island course was reasonable. \"We can do more in the Island location; we still have a lot of GFA (gross floor area),\" he said.\n\nThe GFA of leasehold land at the Island site is 30,000 square metres, significantly more than Bukit's 3,551 sq m.\n\nThe Island site also has 1.66 million sq m of leasehold land bank, compared to 1.18 million sq m of leasehold land bank at Bukit. SICC owns another 12,000 sq m worth of freehold GFA and 21,272 sq m worth of landbank at Bukit.\n\nThe Island site allowed more scope for reconfiguration of golf courses as well as more space for non-golfing facilities, SICC president Tay Joo Soon pointed out in his Feb 19 message to members. Keeping Bukit would also have required significant capital expenditure to bring the standard of its facilities up to that of Island, he said.\n\nMr Desmond Tay also offered a new argument in favour of keeping the Island location: the proposed Cross Island MRT line would impact it less than the Bukit location as the line cuts across part of the Bukit courses.\n\nSICC has to give up one of its four 18-hole courses for public use as the government plans to redevelop Singapore's only public 18-hole course at Marina Bay for housing and commercial uses. The government wants to have at least one 18-hole course - a typical full-sized course - available for the public, national servicemen and the labour movement.\n\nThe debate is now likely to shift to which of the two Bukit courses SICC will give up: the Sime Course located off Braddell Road or the Bukit Course located further in after the clubhouse.\n\nThe lease for one of SICC's two 18-hole courses at the Bukit location will not be renewed when it expires at end-2021. The government said SICC's other Bukit course can be offered a lease extension until 2030, conditional on them reaching a sharing agreement on the Bukit side with the labour movement by next February.\n\nMeanwhile, the lease extension for the Island location will be until 2040.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

His mission has gotten harder as the national carrier hunts for a lost plane carrying 239 people.\n\nThe 59-year-old power industry veteran has presided over a 63 per cent slump in the stock since joining the state-controlled airline in September 2011, battered by unviable routes and competition from low-cost carriers including AirAsia. The airline lost a total RM4.13 billion (S$1.6 billion) over its past three financial years.\n\nRescuers have been searching for MAS Flight MH370 since it disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing early on Saturday. It is the second mishap in six months. In October, a Twin Otter DHC6 plane operated by its unit MASwings crash-landed in Sabah on Borneo island, killing two. That was the first fatal plane accident in Malaysia since August 2009, according to AviationSafetyNetwork, a Netherlands-based website that tracks safety statistics.\n\n\"When something like this happens, it does impact greatly on the reputation, their ability to turn around,\" said Shukor Yusof, an analyst at Standard & Poor's in Singapore. \"Also, it casts a negative light on the management and shareholders of the company.\"\n\nMAS has seen newer budget operators leapfrogging it with bigger fleets, with margins eroded on popular routes. Mr Ahmad Jauhari has also had to contend with some politicians calling on the Malaysian government to sell its stake in the airline which lost RM1.17 billion last year.\n\nMr Ahmad Jauhari spent about 16 years in the power generation industry, where he rose to the rank of managing director at Kuala Lumpur-based Malakoff, the nation's largest private sector power generation group before it was delisted.\n\nWhen he left Malakoff in 2010, the power producer had more than doubled its earnings per share to 93 sen from 40 sen in 2008 following the global crisis, according to the company's annual reports. Mr Ahmad Jauhari was the CEO of privately held Premium Renewable Energy for about six months before joining MAS.\n\nHis career also included stints at Esso Malaysia, the then petroleum retailing unit of Exxon Mobil Corp, and newspaper publishing group New Straits Times Press.\n\nFourteen out of 16 analysts who cover the stocks have a \"sell\" rating, while two recommend \"hold\", according data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nChallenges ahead for Mr Ahmad Jauhari include boosting worker productivity, while trying to convince travellers to stick with the airline even after this incident.\n\nMAS employees are less productive than their counterparts at neighbouring airlines. They each generate an average of US$222,000 in annual revenue, less than half the figure at Singapore Airlines Bloomberg data show. Workers at Thai Airways International and PT Garuda Indonesia Persero each bring in more revenue.\n\nThe national carrier, incorporated as Malayan Airways Ltd in October 1937, operates a fleet of 96 planes, according to its website. The company plans to order as many as 100 aircraft, and is seeking to start taking deliveries of the new ones from late 2016 or early 2017 as it works to upgrade its fleet over the next decade, a person familiar with the matter said in February.\n\nThe airline's worst crash was in 1977 when 100 people died after a reported hijacking, according to the Malay Mail.\n\nThe carrier needs new fuel-efficient jets to cut costs amid rising competition from discount airlines. Budget operators in South-east Asia have ordered at least 1,000 new aircraft in the past five years as economic expansion across the region enables more people to start flying in countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam.\n\nKhazanah Nasional, a Malaysian sovereign investment company, has a 69.4 per cent stake in the carrier. In May 2012, the fund reversed a share swap that had handed 21 per cent of MAS to the parents of AirAsia, the budget carrier run by Tony Fernandes. The about-face followed complaints by MAS biggest union.\n\nAmong those who called for the government to sell out of MAS are former premier Mahathir Mohamad, who oversaw its initial public offering in 1985, and the executive who previously returned the carrier to profit. Former Malaysian Air managing director Idris Jala, now a minister in Prime Minister Najib Razak's Cabinet, said in August that the government should stay out of the airline business. Mr Idris returned the company to profit on a quarterly basis in 2006.\n\nDr Mahathir, Malaysia's longest-serving leader, told state news service Bernama last year that a private owner would work harder to avoid losses than the government. Mr Najib said in August that the government will not sell its stake, and the airline's turnaround \"cannot happen overnight\". - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

He previously acquired 812,000 shares in June 2013 at an average of 26.3 cents each. Prior to his purchases since 2013, the chairman acquired 4.4 million shares from August 2009 to November 2010 at an average of 20.7 cents each and 2.49 million shares in October 2008 at an average of 18.6 cents each. Zagro Asia announced on Feb 25 a 13 per cent rise in annual total comprehensive income to $9.003 million. Its shares closed at 31.5 cents on Friday.\n\nSee Hup Seng\n\nExecutive director and group CEO Henry Ng Han Kok resumed buying shares of grit blasting and tank cleaning firm See Hup Seng, after the stock fell by 13 per cent from his acquisition price on Jan 23, with 1.1 million shares purchased on March 5 at 30.5 cents each. The trade increased his direct holdings to 31.471 million shares or 5.17 per cent. He also has deemed interest of 42.769 million shares or 7.03 per cent. He previously acquired five million shares on Jan 23 at 35 cents each and an initial 25.37 million shares from Jan 6 to 22 at an average of 32.9 cents each. The purchases since January are Mr Ng's first on-market trades since his appointment as executive director on Jan 3 (Mr Ng was appointed group CEO on Feb 28). The acquisitions were made on the back of the drop in the share price since October 2013 from 39 cents. Despite the fall in the share price, the counter is still up since November 2011 from 14.2 cents\n\nThe corporate shareholder sentiment is not entirely positive this quarter as substantial shareholder Chew Hoe Soon unloaded 3.6 million shares on Feb 25 at 32 cents each, which lowered his stake (direct and deemed) by 9 per cent to 34.709 million shares or 5.7 per cent. He acquired a net 11.9 million shares from May 17 to July 1, 2013, at 29 cents each and had an initial filing on May 14, 2013, of 5.827 million shares at 29.9 cents each, which raised his interest to 6.28 per cent. The company announced on Feb 27 a 52 per cent gain in year-end profit to $7.96 million. The counter closed at 31 cents on Friday.\n\nJB Foods\n\nExecutive director Goh Lee Beng recorded her first on-market trades in cocoa products manufacturer JB Foods since she joined the group in 2003 with an initial 400,000 shares purchased from March 4 to 6 at an average of 25.6 cents each. The shares bought represented 0.08 per cent of the issued capital. The purchases, which accounted for 30 per cent of the stock's trading volume, were made on the back of the 26 per cent drop in the share price since September 2013 from 34.5 cents.\n\nThe counter is also sharply down since February 2013 from 51.5 cents. The acquisitions were also made after JB Foods announced on Feb 28 a fourth quarter loss of RMB 23.095 million ($4.78 million) versus a profit of RMB 7.186 million in the same period in 2012. Loss for the full year was RMB 53.22 million versus a profit of RMB 39.161 million in the previous year. The counter closed at 27 cents on Friday.\n\nRaffles Medical Group\n\nIndependent director Wee Beng Geok recorded her first on-market trade in private integrated healthcare provider Raffles Medical Group since June 2011 with 50,000 shares sold on March 6 at $3.28 each. The trade reduced her direct holdings by 5 per cent to 1.021 million shares or 0.18 per cent. The sale was made on the back of the 10 per cent rebound in the share price since February from $2.98.\n\nDespite the rebound in the share price, the counter is still down since April 2013 from $3.52. The disposal was made at a profit based on the 120,000 shares that she acquired via exercise of options on Feb 4 at 78 cents each. The director previously sold 30,000 shares in June 2011 at $2.31 each. Prior to that sale, Ms Wee acquired an initial 30,000 shares in June 2002 at 34 cents each.\n\nAlso negative this quarter is Aberdeen Asset Management Asia with a disposal-related filing on Feb 7 of 240,000 shares at $3.05 each, which lowered its deemed stake to 38.722 million shares or 6.99 per cent. The group previously reported a purchase-related filing in April 2013 of 325,000 shares at $3.31 each, a purchase-related filing in February 2013 of 195,000 shares at $3.20 each and an initial filing in November 2012 of 159,000 shares at $2.42 each, which raised its interest to 5.0 per cent.\n\nThe company announced its annual results on Feb 24 with profit up by 49.1 per cent to $85.295 million. The stock closed at $3.32 on Friday.\n\nThe writer is managing director, Asia Insider Ltd\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/bos-aims-double-aum-growth", "site_title": "BOS aims to double AUM growth", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nBOS aims to double AUM growth\n\nBank of Singapore did some spring cleaning and upgrading last year and growth is back on track, its CEO tells SIOW LI SEN\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Mar 9, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nFOLLOWING three years of strong growth, Bank of Singapore (BOS) spent 2013 spring cleaning and upgrading its back-office operations - but, growth is now back in focus, says chief executive Renato de Guzman.\n\nFor 2014, BOS is aiming to grow assets under management (AUM) by 15 per cent, almost double that of last year, said Mr de Guzman.\n\nIts AUM rose 8.0 per cent in 2013 - slower than the previous three years of double-digit gains, as the bank turned its attention to building up its infrastructure and weeding out clients whose AUMs fell below US$1 million.\n\n\"We have to go back to 15 per cent growth,\" its CEO said.\n\n\"Asia is still the sweet spot for private banks and that's where we're positioned,\" he added, seemingly unfazed by the challenges the industry faces.\n\nOf late, as the pressures of cost show no signs of easing, more private bankers are warning of the difficulties of making a decent profit from serving Asia's rich.\n\nWealth creation in Asia will continue to expand at a more rapid clip than anywhere else, but expensive experienced client advisers and increasingly more complex regulatory demands make it a tough industry.\n\nA McKinsey Private Banking Survey 2012 said Asia was growing fast but profit margins were at record lows due to high cost.\n\nLast week, Singapore, the second largest wealth management centre after Switzerland was found to be the most expensive city to live in, said the Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nNo surprises then that despite frequent headlines screaming Asian billionaires, some private banks are up for sale - the latest being Societe Generale's (SocGen's) Asian private bank. DBS Group Holdings is said to be the buyer for SocGen's private bank.\n\nWealth-X and UBS Billionaire Census 2013 last November said Asia saw the highest percentage rise in billionaire population (3.7 per cent from 2012 to 508 individuals). It also experienced the strongest surge in wealth - 13 per cent to US$1.18 trillion.\n\nSingapore, with 27 billionaires, has the fifth largest billionaire population in Asia, and the 18th largest in the world.\n\nProfits don't necessarily follow, unless one has scale; and, for BOS, it has another advantage - the \"Asian alternative\", says Mr de Guzman.\n\nThe Asian alternative is an option for clients looking to diversify their banker, he said.\n\nAsian banks have much stronger balance sheets. BOS and parent OCBC Bank, both with an Aa1 credit rating from Moody's, are rated higher than the Swiss banks, he noted.\n\nUBS, Credit Suisse and Julius Baer are rated A2 by Moody's.\n\n\"Singapore banks are much safer than European banks . . . We're only supervised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS),\" he said.\n\nDBS Bank, OCBC Bank and United Overseas Banks (UOB) were named the three safest Asian banks in that order by finance magazine Global Finance last year. The three Singapore banks were ranked third to fifth among the world's safest commercial banks.\n\nBeing in Singapore, which has a AAA sovereign rating, is another plus, he said.\n\nThe Republic's \"safe haven, safe place, stable government, consistency in rule of law and open to foreign investment\" are a big draw for the rich when they think of where to park their money.\n\n\"We also have the OCBC banking facilities, products and services to complement our services,\" he said.\n\nWhile AUM growth was slower last year, revenues and returns were better than the industry's, he said.\n\nBOS registered revenue growth of 19 per cent in 2013, aided by an AUM gain of 8 per cent to US$46 billion. It also saw an increase in its earning assets base by 9 per cent to US$56.5 billion.\n\nIts AUM are twice the US$22 billion recorded at the launch of BOS in January 2010 when it became part of OCBC. BOS was the former ING Asia Private Bank. The sale was a \"good fit\" as \"private banking didn't come naturally to OCBC then\", he said.\n\nOn last year's spring cleaning, he said it was necessary to weed out the smaller accounts, as providing private banking services is very expensive.\n\nInvestments went into back-room operations and IT. BOS spent US$34 million last year and will pump in another US$29 million this year into infrastructure, he said.\n\n\"We're rolling out straight through processing for trading of all asset classes,\" he said.\n\nThe bank added 23 new relationship managers last year, boosting the total to 303. Total staff strength is 1,100.\n\nHe is confident growth will go back to double digits over the next few years.\n\nAt that rate, could AUM almost double to US$80 billion by 2017? Mr de Guzman did not want to commit, but said he is excited by new opportunities. One area of focus going forward is Greater China, he said.\n\nParent OCBC has been ramping up its China operations, one of three areas of focus for the bank outside its main Singapore market.\n\nIt is currently negotiating to buy over Hong Kong's Wing Hang Bank.\n\nThe Hong Kong lender has 43 branches in Hong Kong, 12 in Macau and 15 outlets in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Huizhou, Zhuhai and Foshan on the mainland. OCBC has one branch in Hong Kong, none in Macau and 16 in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.\n\nOCBC chief executive Samuel Tsien last September said that \"Greater China contributes more than 6 per cent to group earnings\". Indonesia accounts for about 5 per cent and Malaysia, 22 per cent.\n\nGreater China has the potential to increase its contribution to the mid-teens, Mr Tsien said. \"Though it's not easy to do business in China, it's the driver of much of economic growth in Asia.\n\n\"Where OCBC does well, we'll do well,\" said Mr de Guzman.\n\nMr de Guzman, 63, is a career banker. His first job at 25 was with a Philippine bank. He then moved to French-owned BNP Paribas, where he spent 12 years, followed by a 20-year spell at ING.\n\n\"It was a good industry to get into; it suited my background of finance and accounting,\" he said.\n\nHe moved to Singapore in 2000, when he was tasked with consolidating all of ING's private banking Asian business into a regional platform. He says banking is a complex business and private banking is a discipline in itself.\n\nAs for the worst spell in his 38-year career, he points to the global financial crisis of 2008/2009. \"It was the 'mother of all financial crises' and the worst period in my life and career. Everyone was running for the exit and there was no place to hide.\"\n\nHe said the bank had to extend some support to the clients since some markets had completely disappeared and there was no liquidity. \"Generally, our clients were able to hold on to their positions and recovered fully two years after. It was a very good learning experience, in terms of dealing with the financial crisis,\" he said.\n\nAs for when he would eventually retire, he would only say, \"My competition would love me to retire, they're the ones talking about my retirement\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

People became over-educated and underemployed.\"\n\nSingapore should not take for granted that it would not face these problems in the future, he said. He noted that by 2020, Singapore would see 40 per cent cohort participation in its local universities. In addition, there would also be many pursuing private or overseas degrees.\n\n\"In theory, this can mean that we have an increasing pool of better educated and skilled workforce,\" he said. \"We should be better able to move up the value chain.\"\n\nBut these jobs would only be created by good companies, he said. And these companies would only be here if there's a healthy economy and a business-friendly environment.\n\n\"If such companies are drawn elsewhere, those jobs will not be here,\" Mr Tan added. \"Hence, we must ensure that our future economy will continue to generate good jobs for our graduate job seekers.\"\n\nPointing to the potential danger of producing too many graduates, he said: \"We will need to watch this development carefully and help Singaporeans make informed educational choices.\"\n\nThe acting minister also reported that the foreign manpower tightening measures introduced over the past years are starting to \"bite\", with foreign employment growth at its lowest in five years. He noted that a number of the measures will kick in fully this year and in 2015\n\nBut he said there's still some way to go in reducing Singapore's overall dependence on foreign workers. Meanwhile, the government is doing more to raise the quality of the foreign workers in Singapore.\n\n\"The measures that we have announced in the Budget this year signal our move to raise the quality of our foreign workforce and by extension, productivity,\" he said.\n\nThe government has unveiled a new market-based skills recognition framework for the construction sector to encourage firms to retain experienced basic-skilled R2 Work Permit holders for a longer period and on higher pay. \"With this, companies can upgrade their R2 workers to 'Higher Skilled', or R1 status, and will not have to bear the higher foreign worker levies that we announced in Budget 2014.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The building was redeveloped behind its original Portland stone facade in the late 1980s by Nomura. It now comprises 276,792 square feet of Grade A office arranged over basement, ground and nine upper floors.\n\nAt \u00a3171 million, the purchase price translates to about \u00a3618 per square foot and reflects a net yield of 5.5 per cent with total annual rentals of more than \u00a39.9 million.\n\nIts tenants comprise Mitsui & Co Europe, Pyramis Global Advisors, Julius Baer International, SS&C Technologies and Nomura International. The average lease before the break options and lease expires are 8 years and 12 years, respectively.\n\nChairman and chief executive officer of Ho Bee Land Chua Thian Poh said: \"The acquisition is part and parcel of the group's continuing diversification overseas in times when the local market is facing very strong headwinds with limited investment opportunities.\"\n\nMr Chua said the acquisition, Ho Bee's second in less than a year, reflects the group's confidence in the London office market.\n\nA 5 per cent cash deposit has been paid and the balance will be payable in cash on completion which is scheduled on March 28.\n\nIn May 2013, Ho Bee Land acquired Rose Court in London for \u00a367.2 million. The 157,406 sq ft office block overlooking the Thames on the Southbank is expected to be redeveloped as a \u00a3250 million residential scheme.\n\nAnalysts like Ho Bee's move to increase exposure to investment properties given the slowdown in high-end residential development sales in Singapore which is reeling from the government's property cooling measures.\n\n\"The earnings contributions from its overseas developments including China and Australia should come through from FY15 onwards,\" said an analyst.\n\nLast month, Ho Bee posted a net profit of $592 million for FY13, up from $187 million a year ago. Its bottom line got a major boost from the $490 million revaluation gains from the newly completed office development at The Metropolis at One-North. Turnover for FY2013 fell 70 per cent to about $139 million.\n\n\"Twin engines from rental income from The Metropolis and Rose Court, London, will underpin earnings in 2014/15 while development property income from Australia and China will drive earnings growth in 2015/16,\" UOB KayHian said after the results.\n\nThe local brokerage has a buy call on Ho Bee with a raised target price of $2.68 a share from $2.45 previously.\n\nCompared to some of its peers, Ho Bee has a relatively low gearing of about 15 per cent.\n\n\"On a look-through basis, we estimate a net gearing of 20-30 per cent in FY14-16, leaving room for acquisitions. We hope to see more accretive acquisitions in the office space to strengthen Ho Bee's foothold as an office landlord,\" CIMB said.\n\nHo Bee ended three cents lower at $2.12 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Our value proposition hasn't been about offering discounts. We're not trying to be the cheapest,\" she said.\n\nInstead, the increasingly savvy female buyer in the region is hungry for a wider variety of products, thanks to a growing middle class being exposed to foreign stores online.\n\n\"More women now know that the 12 prestige brands that they keep seeing on Orchard Road are not the only ones out there,\" she said.\n\nShoppers in Singapore, in particular, tend to conduct extensive research into the products they buy. This leads them to Western stores because shoppers are wary of counterfeit goods on some Asian sites, and Western stores are willing to ship to Singapore, she said. \"That opportunity is leaving Singapore stores and going to US or UK-based sites because of availability.\"\n\nWith this, the company increased the spread of unique items in its inventory from 400 to 2,500 now, and this will hit 5,000 by the end of the year. It also acquired a fleet of delivery vans and built a logistics platform to run them, in order to provide same-day delivery in Singapore, giving it an edge over foreign sites, which have to rely on expensive third-party logistics providers here.\n\nLuxola also has a feature that predicts what users might want, and pushes them subscription options to keep them coming back. If the system detects a repeat purchase at a regular interval, it will flag the item to the shopper and ask if they would like to be billed on a recurring basis for it.\n\nThanks to these strategies, the average basket size has grown from about $55 to $78 over the past year.\n\nLuxola is running on the US$2 million in funding it won from Japanese investor Gree Ventures in March last year. It's in the middle of raising a much larger round.\n\nThe company has not broken even yet, but Ms Horowitz-Burdick intends to use its next round of funding to expand more aggressively in its primary markets of Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia.\n\nThe company has 30 people in Singapore and 12 in Jakarta, and this year will see it setting up and staffing new offices in Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines.\n\nOne costly portion of its overheads is logistics, an area of major investment for Luxola in order to beat its Western counterparts in the region.\n\nShe pointed out that even in a small market like Singapore, same-day delivery is too costly or unreliable when entrusted to third-party providers. Growing its own fleet and ensuring more robust deliveries in the region will provide a significant advantage for Luxola, she said.\n\n\"We're not trying to be a logistics company,\" she added. \"If (third party players) beef up their services, I certainly hope we can offload the function eventually.\"\n\nTill then, the company is pegging its expansion plans on projected growth. It has grown about 40 per cent month-on-month so far, and Ms Horowitz-Burdick said her plans are based on expectations of that momentum carrying on for \"the next couple of years before we even come close to slowing down\".\n\nLuxola was initially launched on a seed round of $740,000 from Wavemaker Labs and the National Research Foundation (NRF). It had an initial angel round of $525,000 before that.\n\nMs Horowitz-Burdick came to Singapore from Washington, DC, about seven years ago, and set up a group buying site here called The Sweet Spot, which was later acquired by JigoCity in 2011.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For the first two months of 2014, issuance of offshore RMB bonds have totalled US$6.2 billion, almost three times the US$2.3 billion issued for the same period last year, according to Dealogic.\n\nChinese maker of solar cells Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology failed to pay the interest on its onshore yuan bonds, due yesterday.\n\nAnalysts are warning more Chinese companies will default on their bonds given the enormous amount of debt that has been issued over the past five years. But many say unless it's a default by a financial institution, they are not expecting a crisis.\n\nTotal debt of publicly traded non-financial companies in China and Hong Kong has surged to US$1.98 trillion from US$607 billion at the end of 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\"The onshore and offshore markets are very different,\" said Mr Lee.\n\nCompanies which issued offshore yuan bonds generally have better credit profiles, he noted.\n\n\"And unless Chaori has truckloads of offshore bonds . . . that's why it hasn't impacted the offshore RMB market,\" he said.\n\nAs for yuan volatility, Mr Lee said the Chinese bond market has developed away from just being a pure currency appreciation play.\n\nThe yuan had its fastest monthly loss in 20 years in February as the Chinese authorities weakened the currency though its intentions were unclear.\n\nDuring February, the yuan, via official intervention, weakened sharply with USD/CNY climbing from 6.0602 to 6.1446 in terms of London closing rates (USD/CNY also hit an intraday high of 6.1808 on Feb 28).\n\nThe 1.5 per cent monthly drop in the yuan's value is the largest since China unified its exchange rates in January 1994, noted Cliff Tan, East Asian head of global markets research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The PWM requirement will apply to all existing contracts by September 2015.\n\nA tripartite cluster has been set up to develop a PWM for the security sector. Mr Hawazi said that when this is ready, the government will apply the PWM requirement to the licensing regime that is already in place in the security sector. A tripartite cluster will also be formed for the landscaping industry.\n\nMr Hawazi said that eventually, the PWM will be extended to more than 80,000 local low-wage workers.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will surpass the 296-meter Landmark Tower in Yokohama, about 32km south of central Tokyo.\n\nThe new 60-floor complex, which includes a Marriott International Inc hotel, and a separate proposal for a 500 billion yen casino resort are the latest attempts to bolster the city's economy.\n\nHowever, rather than tall towers, the metro area of 11 million people may need business zones with fewer regulations, according to Rakuten Securities Economic Research Institute. \"The building will be a success, but total demand won't improve,\" said Masayuki Kubota, chief strategist at the institute. \"Osaka should try special economic zones and create new businesses from those zones.\"\n\nJapan wants to spur growth by easing restrictions in test zones under economic reforms pushed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The government is considering measures from cutting corporate taxes to loosening building restrictions in the zones.\n\nOsaka, once Japan's capital, is the birthplace of the country's biggest brokerage, Nomura Holdings Inc, and Nippon Life Insurance Co, the largest non-government life insurer.\n\nThe 634-meter Tokyo Skytree broadcasting tower is the world's tallest tower, defined as a structure where less than half the total height is usable floor space, according to Guinness World Records. The world's tallest building is the 828-meter Burj Khalifa in Dubai, according to the Chicago-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat.\n\nPopulation growth in the Osaka area has stalled in recent years. The Osaka-Kobe metropolitan area's population is forecast to be 11.3 million next year, the same as in 2005, sliding four places to rank as the world's 19th largest megacity as it's overtaken by Beijing, Manila, Cairo and Lagos, in Nigeria, according to data compiled by the United Nations.\n\nTokyo's metropolitan population is predicted to rise to 35.5 million, retaining its spot as the world's largest megacity, according to the UN.\n\nThe Osaka-Kobe area is still Asia's third-biggest metropolitan economy, with a gross domestic product of US$655 billion, according to figures compiled by the Brookings Institution in 2012. That's larger than the GDP of Switzerland, according to World Bank statistics.\n\nTokyo is the biggest Asian metro economy at US$1.52 trillion and Seoul-Incheon is second at US$774 billion, according to Brookings.\n\nTokyo's dominance has contributed to office vacancies in Osaka as companies are drawn to the capital. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc, the nation's largest bank; No 2, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc, and Resona Holdings Inc all moved banking unit headquarters to Tokyo in the past decade after mergers and reorganisations. Nomura relocated its head office to the capital in 1946.\n\nNippon Life is still based in Osaka, as are Panasonic Corp and Sharp Corp.\n\n\"Tokyo is the headquarters centre for an overwhelming number of companies,\" said Daita Obata, an Osaka- based assistant manager at real estate brokerage Miki Shoji Corp.\n\nOffice vacancies in Osaka's business districts were 9.45 per cent in February, the third-worst of seven major Japanese cities measured by Miki Shoji. Tokyo had the lowest rate at 7.01 per cent, according to the Tokyo-based company's latest report.\n\n\"Abeno Harukas has almost completely filled its offices,\" Mr Obata said. \"However, most of the occupants are coming from the areas around Osaka. It's not having a big impact.\"\n\nSharp will move some of its sales staff to the new building, said Miyuki Nakayama, a spokeswoman for the electronics maker.\n\nJapan's dependence on commuting by trains in major cities has ensured profits for rail operators, allowing them to finance large-scale infrastructure projects and enabling Kintetsu to build Abeno Harukas.\n\nTobu Railway Co completed the Tokyo Skytree in 2012, financing the project itself. Last year, a new shopping and office complex opened in the north of Osaka next to West Japan Railway Co's main station, featuring four towers ranging from 33 to 48 stories and 557,000 sq meters of space.\n\nOsaka's newest tower takes its name from Abeno, the area where it's located, and Harukas, an old Japanese expression that means \"to brighten or clear up\", according to its website. The building's exterior design was overseen by Cesar Pelli of Pelli Clarke Pelli architects in New Haven, Connecticut, who also designed the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\"It will be the first building in Osaka to be bathed each morning in the light of the rising sun,\" Kintetsu says on its website. \"Visitors to the top floor will be treated to spectacular views seen nowhere else.\"\n\nOsaka officials are in talks with Caesars Entertainment Corp, Genting Singapore and MGM Resorts International to build a gambling complex on reclaimed land in the city's bay, Osaka Prefecture governor Ichiro Matsui said in January.\n\nThe area is also lobbying to become one of the nation's designated special economic zones, Jiji reported, citing Shosuke Mori, chairman of the Kansai Economic Federation.\n\nThere will be a maximum of five zones in Japan, said Tatsuo Hatta, a member of the government council on the zones. Tokyo may make a decision on the locations this month, Mr Abe said earlier this year.\n\n\"Osaka used to be the commercial city and Tokyo used to be the government city,\" said Mr Kubota at the Rakuten Securities Economic Research Institute. \"As Japan's original commercial city, Osaka should free lots of restrictions to spur growth.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

This solo photo exhibition will be on display at the Alliance Francaise Societe Generale Gallery this month in celebration of International Women's Day.\n\n\"We decided for this exhibition to only use images taken in the Middle East. The common thread is the focus on girls and women, and then the location in a different perspective,\" says Matar.\n\nHer intention is to showcase these women in the same way as any others from anywhere else in the world - facing the same struggles whether as teenagers or as mothers.\n\nShe explains: \"There's a universality of being a girl, a young woman, a mother, etc. It didn't matter in some ways where the images were shot, we are all similar in essence. For me, people are the same.\"\n\nMatar herself is a mother to four kids, and reveals that it was the documentation of their daily lives which got her started in photography and led her away from her profession as an architect.\n\n\"I think I found photography at the right time in my life and it seemed that everything I did up to that point converged to make it (literally) click. The events of Sept 11 was when I started working as a photographer, and my being the product of two cultures made me want to tell the story the way I saw it,\" she elaborates.\n\nOne photo Matar highlights is of a wrecking ball knocking down some buildings in the background while a mother smiles at her toddler in the foreground. The artist's juxtaposition of the mother's smile against the ongoing destruction is her way of recognising \"how people in Lebanon always end up picking up the pieces and moving forward,\" she says.\n\nUltimately, Matar also hopes her exhibition will be a testament to the strength she sees in these women who live in the Middle East, and how they get through everything that happens around them.\n\n\"I am humbled by the women who brought safety and stability to their homes and their children, and who just kept going every day with the simple tasks of their daily lives,\" she adds. \"Women seem to bear the brunt of wars and yet are the ones keeping their homes and their children going.\"\n\nAdding to this conversation is photographer Oh Soon-Hwa, an associate professor at Nanyang Technological University's School of Art, Design and Media. She is curating an upcoming group exhibition titled HER IMAGE, which will be held at The Private Museum later this month, and runs alongside a symposium - Women in Photographs from Asia and Middle East.\n\nAccording to Dr Oh, the idea for the event first came about when she met a visiting anthropologist - professor Lilia Labidi from the National University of Singapore Middle East Institute (MEI-NUS), and the two discovered a shared interest in photography and women despite the difference in heritage.\n\nHER IMAGE aims to explore three main themes - Women, memory and history; Women in daily life; and Women artists and photo-journalists - in a mixture of photography and videography works.\n\n\"Photography has traditionally been known for its capacity to capture the reality, the truth,\" says Dr Oh. \"So we also wanted to cover different aspects of women in photography in Asia and the Middle East... and intrigue the audience regarding certain matters, without providing all the answers.\"\n\nOne of the artists for HER IMAGE is local photographer Jesvin Yeo, whose works are in line with the \"Women in daily life\" theme. She shot most of her displayed works while travelling in places such as Beijing, Tokyo and Malaysia while documenting the lives of women working \"under the sun and on the street\".\n\nYeo explains that her works intend to raise questions about the \"discrepancies between the ideal role of women and the reality of the modern world\". She adds: \"I want to ask questions like \"Can a woman actually accept this as her ideal role?\" or \"Can a normal woman really be who she wants to be?\"\n\nOrdinary Lives: Women of the Middle East runs from March 10 to March 29 at the Societe Generale Gallery at Alliance Francaise de Singapour. Opening hours are from 11am to 7pm on weekdays, and 11am to 5pm on Sat. Closed on Sun and public holidays. Admission is free. Log on to\n\nwww.alliancefrancaise.org.sg\n\nfor more information.\n\nHER IMAGE runs at The Private Museum at 51 Waterloo Street from March 28 to May 25.

By Geoffrey Eu\n\nListen to this article\n\nPublished Fri, Mar 7, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT sits in a small corner in northern South America, 20,000km and multiple time zones away on the other side of the world, but Ecuador has a few things in common with Singapore, not least of which are a tropical climate (at sea level, anyway) and yes, the Equator, that imaginary line at latitude 0 degrees running around the centre of the planet.\n\nIn theory, it would be possible to dig a hole from Singapore through the earth's core and end up in Ecuador - although flying there would be a lot faster. Singapore's location just north of the Equator also means that unlike Ecuador, it isn't able to build tourist sites featuring Equator museums and monuments with lines on the ground marking the centre of the world. Instead, we will have to make do with the Merlion.\n\nA trip to South America requires commitment and ideally a sense of adventure on the part of the traveller. While Ecuador probably isn't going to be the first country on the continent you visit, perhaps it ought to be. For a country that is roughly the size of New Zealand and home to about 14 million people, the sheer diversity on offer is impressive (admittedly the food isn't world class yet but it's improving all the time).\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n4\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\n5\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal", "images": []}

That - coupled with copious amounts of over-the-top sex, drug use and violent behaviour that would normally be associated with someone from the dregs of society rather than a trusted officer of the law - makes Filth an intoxicating and yes, dirty blend of farce and tragedy.\n\nMcAvoy's character in the film is depraved, divisive and devoid of morals. It's also quite possible that he's completely insane.\n\nDetective Sergeant Bruce Robertson (McAvoy) of the Edinburgh Constabulary is a man perpetually high on cocaine and alcohol and wrestling with inner demons. This nasty boy is in competition with his colleagues on the force for a promotion so when he's put in charge of a murder investigation, he goes all out to destroy their chances while enhancing his own.\n\nWhen it comes to crooked cops of the cinema, Robertson is a blood brother to the likes of the characters played by Harvey Keitel in Bad Lieutenant (1992) and Denzel Washington in Training Day (2001).\n\nFilth is difficult to watch at times - and not just because of the thick Scottish accents. The film, written and directed by Jon S Baird, is an adaptation of the 1998 book by Irvine Welsh, whose earlier novel Trainspotting was the source of a celebrated film about Scottish lowlives.\n\nRobertson is a repulsive sort who somehow manages to appeal to weak-willed women who have suffered a loss of some sort, but roguish charm doesn't begin to describe him.\n\nInstead, he offends colleagues and destroys friendships with misanthropic ardour, insinuating that one of his fellow officers is a closet gay while cruelly mocking another's unfortunate, um, shortcomings.\n\nIt's all a game to him, and he's the one who makes up the rules. Bearing the brunt of his bullying abuse is Clifford Blades (Eddie Marsan), a mild-mannered accountant and his bored wife Bunty (Shirley Henderson), who is the target of a series of crudely relentless prank calls.\n\nThe only person immune to Robertson's poisonous barbs is the primly efficient Amanda Drummond (Imogen Poots), another contender for the vacant detective inspector post. By way of explaining Robertson's sociopathic behaviour, we're fed intermittent scenes of his wife (Shauna Macdonald) prancing around in lacy underwear, along with dream-like sessions with his psychiatrist (Jim Broadbent), who dispenses plus-sized medication.\n\nRobertson is also haunted by hallucinations of people in grotesque animal masks and images of a sad, soot-covered young boy.\n\nThe train wreck, when it finally comes, is a bit of a disappointment after the adrenaline-fuelled ride leading up to it.\n\nThere are moments when Filth is in danger of losing control but McAvoy's wildly exuberant performance pulls the movie through. His Bruce Robertson is by turns pathetic, manipulative and execrable - here's to him and other memorable movie creeps.\n\nRating:\n\nC+\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That makes their bonds good to buy.\"\n\nThe Tokyo-based airline will get 11 new daytime take-off and landing slots from Haneda at the end of March, compared with five for Japan Airlines, the Transport Ministry said in October.\n\nJAL protested against the decision but was unable to win more. ANA, seeking to ease its dependence on domestic operations, is also expanding its fleet of Boeing's more fuel-efficient 787 planes for international routes.\n\nANA cited the Haneda flights in targeting 60 billion yen of net income in the year to March 2017, from 30 billion yen next fiscal year and 15 billion yen in the current period, according to the company's mid-term business plan released on Feb 14.\n\nIt forecasts operating margin will increase to 7 per cent from 3.8 per cent as the airline reduces costs by 50 billion yen, adding to 86 billion yen in savings over the past four years.\n\n\"The company has entered a cycle where high level investments into business growth can be compatible with maintaining fiscal health,\" Kazuma Ogino, a credit analyst at Nomura Securities, wrote in a report dated Feb 20. \"Concerns about its financial standing are on the decline.\"\n\nTokyo's Haneda airport restarted intercontinental flights three years ago after opening a new international terminal. The country moved overseas flights to Narita, 70 kilometres east of Japan's capital, more than three decades earlier to cut down on overcrowding.\n\nThe cost to insure the debt of ANA has retreated 22 basis points in the past month to 157 yesterday, according to data provider CMA. That compared with the 8.5 basis-point decline for the Markit iTraxx Japan index, while the gauge for North American companies slid 10.5 in the period.\n\nJapan Airlines, the nation's second-largest carrier, emerged from bankruptcy after cutting about a third of its staff, grounding 103 planes and reducing its flight network.\n\nIts monopoly on flights out of Japan ended in 1986, when a crash that claimed 520 lives prompted the government to grant ANA its international licence.\n\nJAL received 35 billion yen of tax relief in its first full year after exiting bankruptcy and may not have to pay corporate levies until 2020, according to the Liberal Democratic Party.\n\nThe government is considering tightening restrictions on corporate-tax breaks on losses and shortening the number of years they apply, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Feb 4. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

This year is different because exports are picking up and global growth is better,\" said Mr Swan, BlackRock's head of Asian fundamental equity, who is in Singapore for client meetings.\n\nIn China and elsewhere, he is buying \"value\" stocks - notably stocks trading at low price-to-book values that have better management and a story of improving industry dynamics.\n\nHe likes \"old economy\" stocks, which are now seeing slowing supply growth and consolidation after suffering from excess leverage and overcapacity. They include stocks in the industrials, basic materials and energy sectors, he said. By contrast, he is reducing exposure to high-growth \"new economy\" stocks such as Internet, gaming and renewable energy companies, some of which might not meet lofty earnings expectations, he said.\n\nIn China, while its financial sector challenges are very real, \"the fact that they are well known gives us some comfort, unlike the US situation when things were unknown and happened overnight\".\n\nMr Swan cautioned that China is \"not a one way trade\" and there will be volatility in the short term. But he expects there to be a \"pretty decent return\" at this time next year.\n\nEquity returns come from \"changes at the margins\" - such as moving from a negative outlook to a slightly less negative or neutral outlook, he said. \"As the year progresses that's what we're going to see in Asia,\" he said.\n\nKey to Asian growth is China, which accounts for a big chunk of demand.\n\nExcept for Japan, Asian stocks have underperformed developed market stocks in the past year.\n\nInvestors have been pulling money out of China, spooked by slowing gross domestic product (GDP) growth from over 10 per cent a few years ago to 7 plus per cent now.\n\nToday, Chinese maker of solar cells Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science and Technology is expected to default on a bond interest payment. Bank of America analysts had called the Chaori default China's \"Bear Stearns moment\" that will cause a chain reaction and culminate in a Lehman Brothers bankruptcy-like event.\n\nBut Mr Swan said a default was to be expected - after all, the bond was rated CCC, or near the bottom of the \"junk\" range of bond ratings.\n\nOn the broader financial and economic system, he said Chinese authorities are very well aware of the issues, and are demonstrating a commitment to reform. This is seen in news from this week's National People's Congress conference, he said. Corporate reforms are happening, such as China allowing more private capital into the state-owned energy sector, for example.\n\nReturns on capital typically improve when more decisions are taken by the private sector, he said. As long as reforms continue, new sources of growth will also emerge in consumption and the services sector, he said.\n\nAccording to performance tracker Citywire, Mr Swan is ranked fourth in Asia-Pacific ex-Japan on a one-year and three-year basis, for funds registered in Singapore.\n\nHe told BT he overweighted value stocks in 2012 and growth stocks in 2013. \"Having a flexible approach allowed us to navigate changing times,\" he said. \"This year, growth is still doing well, value is underperforming, but we will get to an inflection point as you see stability due to reform and global growth.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is a sight made all the more nerve-racking because the actors are just metres away from you. That they would lose their balance at any point and crash into you is a real - and thrilling - possibility.\n\nThe Necessary Stage's highly charged production of Poor Thing wants to present and dissect that not-so-rare creature called the Ugly Singaporean. The performance space has been reconfigured by set designer Vincent Lim, so that the action takes place right in the centre, with the audience seated or standing around it, as if they were witnessing a circus show or a burning building.\n\nWhat they're witnessing, in fact, is a car accident. Two cars, a BMW and a Ford, are involved in a fender-bender. The BMW driver is a well-off Chinese man Jevon (played by Joshua Lim) driving home from a party with his drunk Eurasian wife Alisha (Sharda Harrison). The Ford is driven by a working-class Malay woman Sharifah (Siti Khalijah Zainal) who's taking her gay and unemployed Chindian friend Jerome (Dwayne Lau) to his army reservist training.\n\nWhen Sharifah refuses to pay for the damages to Jevon's car, even though she's clearly at fault for tailgating, the incident escalates into a long and nasty quarrel. Race, class, sexuality and religion become inexhaustible wellsprings of insults and abuse. The upper-crust Jevon and Alisha make derisive comments about Jerome and Sharifah's socio-economic status. Sharifah and Jerome think the system is always rigged in favour of rich people. Everyone, it seems, has a chip or two on the shoulder.\n\nFor director Alvin Tan and playwright Haresh Sharma, Poor Thing is another gutsy examination of the so-called fault-lines of Singapore society. Their previous plays like Model Citizens (2010), Gemuk Girls (2008) and Fundamentally Happy (2006) are some of the most sharply-observed and sometimes shocking social dramas ever written and produced in this country.\n\nPoor Thing, however, doesn't belong in the same league. Unlike those of its predecessors, the characters here feel contrived, each standing for various opposing social forces designed to converge and brew the perfect storm. Jerome, for instance, is an unemployed homosexual Chindian, thus embodying three minority categories: economic, sexual and racial.\n\nSharifah is not just a foul-mouthed minah, she's also going through a bad break-up with her cheating mat boyfriend. Alisha is not just a rich, beautiful and privileged Eurasian, her condescending remarks towards Jerome and Sharifah sound distinctly neo-colonialistic.\n\nI'm not saying that such people don't exist. They do. But I can't say I've ever seen a play by The Necessary Stage where the characterisations felt so unsubtle and the conflict so predetermined. These are moments when the characters look ready to give in and get out of argument, but something gets thrown in to draw out the conflict and repeat the cycle of hatred.\n\nIn spite of these quibbles, Poor Thing does triumph in being the first Singaporean play that ambitiously plugs itself into the realm of social media. The audience were told via email the day before to \"befriend\" Jerome on Facebook.\n\nThey were also asked to check their Facebook during the play to see pictures of the incident posted by Jerome in real-time. The audience could type in their comments, which Jerome might read and incorporate into the action of the play.\n\nThese added new thematic dimensions - voyeurism, trolling, cyber-bullying and the quickness of online commentators to judge events told from only one perspective - to the play's already bubbling cauldron of discord.\n\nPoor Thing plays at The Necessary Stage's Black Box at Marine Parade Community Building till tomorrow.

We will monitor it,\" said Mr Teo.\n\nAt the same time, he noted that \"Reits are not necessarily the leading players in the rental space market, because they currently only own about 13 per cent and 16 per cent of retail and industrial rental spaces respectively. Like any other landlord, they have to compete in the rental market to attract tenants and cannot charge excessive rents\".\n\nMr Teo also said that rents for space are likely to moderate in the medium term, as the government has released a \"significant amount of land\".\n\nOver the next three years, about 145,000 square metres of new shop space will be completed each year. Over the same period, an average of 500,000 square metres of multiple-user factory space will come on-stream each year.\n\nFor the former, that represents more than double the average annual demand for such space in the last three years; for the latter, it is just under double.\n\nEntrepreneurship will also receive a boost, since by the end of this year, JTC will open two more blocks to incubate start-ups, as part of a cluster called JTC LaunchPad@one-north.\n\n\"It's our answer to Silicon Valley,\" said Mr Teo.\n\nIn response to Inderjit Singh's (Ang Mo Kio) concern that the government's restructuring efforts are taking place too quickly, Trade and Industry Minister Lim Hng Kiang said that the appropriate pace may differ at the macro, sectoral, and firm levels.\n\n\"I would argue that if you look at it at the macro level, we're not doing it as fast as we should ... If you look at the way the economy is still growing, and the jobs that are still generating, and the labour force (that is) still growing, one could argue that we're slightly behind the curve,\" said Mr Lim. He added that on the sectoral and firm levels, the ideal pace would vary among sectors and companies.\n\n\"So we prefer the middle path - consistent, steady restructuring,\" said Mr Lim, who said \"we feel that this is the right pace\".\n\nMeanwhile, Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry Lee Yi Shyan provided more details on the government's plans to assist companies in their internationalisation efforts.\n\nFor instance, $25 million has been set aside to enhance International Enterprise (IE) Singapore's programmes to better cater to companies at different stages of growth. This is expected to benefit 200 companies over the next two years.\n\nTo help rapidly expanding companies which tend to find securing financing challenging, the government will double the maximum loan quantum under the Internationalisation Finance Scheme from $15 million to $30 million.\n\nIn addition to an enhancement in the existing Global Company Partnership initiative, the government will also increase its support for pilot and test-bedding projects - which help companies test out the viability of their products and solutions in new markets - from 50 per cent to up to 70 per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In this show, entitled the Magic of Light, viewers can appreciate his carefully controlled watercolour paintings featuring the texture of surfaces and light on objects such as locks, gates, and rusted metal machines.\n\nThe paintings draw your gaze into close up views, styled like photographs, of metal and wood objects, and everyday snapshots of street scenes.\n\nThere's that sense of contemporary photography that Lok evokes with his watercolour works. The tight angles pose quite a different approach from the usual expansive and wide-angled views of the streets awash in a mottled patches of colour.\n\nThe realistic approach is what he intended right from the start, he says, as he personally doesn't like the \"smudge\" effect of watercolour paintings. \"It's just a style thing. For my works, I use thick Arches paper - 300 gms or 640 gms - so they can absorb the layers of wet, before I paint,\" he explains.\n\nBut he still manages to retain the transparent quality of watercolour, even if he strives for realism - most evident in his portrayal of rust and other temperamental effects of nature on man-made material.\n\nLok's formal art training was only in high school, as he studied graphic design and not fine arts at Nafa, he explains. While his works were noted as early as in the 1990s, he only painted in his spare time while he worked as a graphic designer.\n\nThe highest-priced painting in this exhibition - Symphony of Rust No 2, at $8,000 is a well-regarded one which he has submitted to competitions in 1995, 2000 and 2003. \"I take part in competitions worldwide to see how my works are viewed by judges,\" he explains.\n\nLok's latest achievement includes being juried into The American Watercolour Society's 2014 exhibition - one of the most prestigious watercolour competitions in the world. He's only the third artist from Singapore to enter this competition after Ong Kim Seng and Ng Woon Lam. He was also one of the five winners in Singapore for the international Winsor & Newton Worldwide Millennium Painting Competition in 2000.\n\nThe Magic of Light is on at Utterly Art Exhibition Space, 20B Mosque Street (Level 3) today until Mar 16.

During February, the counter hit a low of S$9.44 and a high of S$10.25.\n\nHong Kong's Cathay Pacific closed yesterday at HK$15.82, up 14 Hong Kong cents, versus a high of HK$15.88 and a low of HK$15.06 in February. Meanwhile, Australia's Qantas was up one Australian cent at A$1.15 yesterday. During the month under review, it rose to A$1.27 and sank to a low of A$1.03.\n\nData in Iata's Airlines Financial Monitor showed that unlike the North American carriers, which are showing stronger operating profits and post-tax net profits, the performance of Asia Pacific carriers is being weighed down by weakness in the cargo markets.\n\nA sample of 12 Asia Pacific airlines posted an operating profit of US$436 million in Q4 last year, versus US$1.358 billion in the year-ago period, while post-tax net loss was US$130 million, compared to a post-tax net profit of US$1.039 billion previously.\n\nJet fuel prices remained fairly flat month-on-month in February, averaging around US$125 per barrel, although Iata cautioned that recent developments in the Ukraine could end up impacting crude oil prices.\n\nIn an update on fares, Iata highlighted that global fares continue to remain weak, hurt by the Asian region as well as currency fluctuations.\n\nStill, Asia Pacific carriers saw strong growth in passenger traffic (measured in revenue-passenger-kilometres) in January, up 11.2 per cent year-on-year. This outstripped a 10.3 per cent expansion in capacity (measured in available-seat-kilometres), resulting in a passenger load factor of 77.2 per cent.\n\nGlobally, passenger traffic rose 8 per cent while capacity expanded by 6.7 per cent, giving rise to a 78.1 per cent load factor.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It was the 11th straight month of declines. Sentiment was also hurt by slowing economic growth and a weaker outlook for this year, with the downward trend likely to continue in the coming months, UTCC said.\n\n\"People are worried about weaker purchasing power, smaller income and fewer new jobs. Consumption is likely to remain subdued until late in the second quarter,\" UTCC economics professor Thanavath Phonvichai told a news conference. \"There is no positive sign in the first quarter. It remains to be seen when a new government will be formed. If we have a new government and its policies in the second quarter, confidence will return.\"\n\nThe survey also showed that consumers' readiness to spend on new cars dropped to its lowest in 26 months, while that for new houses slid to its lowest in over 81/2 years.\n\nProtests aimed at ousting Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra are in their fifth month, but at the weekend the remaining activists closed down several big protest sites and moved to a central Bangkok park. A state of emergency in the capital could be extended until the protests end completely.\n\nThailand held a general election on Feb 2 but it was disrupted by demonstrators, leaving a caretaker government with limited powers to borrow and spend. It may be a long time before a new functioning government can be installed.\n\nThe consumer confidence index has declined steadily since April last year, initially because of slowing economic growth and in recent months due to the political turmoil.\n\nThailand's economy, South-east Asia's second largest after that of Indonesia, grew just 0.6 per cent in the final quarter of 2013 from the previous three months and a year earlier as the turmoil hit consumption, investment and tourism.\n\nLast month, the state planning agency cut its 2014 GDP growth forecast to 3-4 per cent from 4-5 per cent. The central bank recently said growth could be less than 3 per cent. In 2013, the economy expanded 2.9 per cent, far below the 6.5 per cent recorded in 2012. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

Of the buyers, 70 per cent are Singaporeans, William Liem, chief executive officer of the developer Tuan Sing Holdings, told reporters at a media preview yesterday.\n\nThe strong interest comes amid an uncertain residential property market still reeling from cooling measures implemented last year.\n\nMr Liem attributed this to the development's excellent location and long-term investment potential, thanks to its freehold status at a prime location.\n\nThe District 10 condominium, nestled in an enclave of good class bungalows in Bukit Timah, overlooks the Singapore Botanic Gardens and is next to the French Embassy.\n\nIncidentally, this brought about several development and design constraints as the embassy was \"very strict\" about the facing of its units.\n\nAs a result, a \"really painful\" compromise was made to do away with balconies for certain units overlooking the embassy, Mr Liem said.\n\nCluny Park Residence is also within close proximity to popular schools such as Nanyang Primary School, Raffles Girls' Primary School, Singapore Chinese Girls' School and Hwa Chong Institution.\n\nThe development sits on a 49,000 square foot plot of freehold land and houses two to four-bedroom units, including eight penthouses.\n\nEach unit comes with a private entrance foyer, and every ground floor unit also has a private pool.\n\nUnits are priced from $2.3 million for an 800 sq ft two-bedder to $4.5 million for a 1,400 sq ft four-bedder. Penthouse units come in compact (about 1,200 sq ft) and large (about 2,800 sq ft) sizes, costing about $5 million and $8 million, respectively.\n\nAll these work out to a price range of about $2,860 to $4,170 per square foot.\n\nMr Liem, who lives in a ground floor unit of Botanika, a Holland Road condominium also developed by Tuan Sing, revealed that he has also bought \"one of the bigger\" units at Cluny Park Residence.\n\n\"I like to stay at our own condos to experience and see what we can do to improve. Certainly, I will stay here (at Cluny Park Residence) when it is completed.\n\nChief financial officer Chong Chou Yuen said: \"We want to sell and design our property to the extent that we ourselves feel comfortable (in them). We will not sell a property that is not comfortable, too restrictive or too cramped.\"\n\nThe project is expected to receive its temporary occupation permit in the third quarter of 2016.\n\nIts showflat at Dempsey Road will be open from Saturday between 10am and 7pm daily.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The politician had claimed that the reasons given by the authorities for the go-ahead had been \"false and misleading\" or that India's Director General of Civil Aviation had \"acted illegally and in utter disregard of the law\".\n\nAt the core of the various plaintiffs' cases is the notion that India's investment policy allows for foreign parties to take up to 49 per cent of an existing Indian airline that's already operating. He contends that it doesn't hold true for a completely new entity such as AirAsia India.\n\nThe various actions reflect the scale of the opposition to plans by the region's largest budget carrier, together with Indian multinational Tata Group and another private Indian firm, to operate in one of Asia's largest markets.\n\nThe fears of local airlines aren't misplaced. AirAsia already boasts one of the lowest operating cost structures in the global aviation industry and the Indian airline industry is already reeling from competitive pressures.\n\nAll airlines operating in India, put together, registered a total loss of US$500 million as at September 2013. Indeed, the FIA said as much stating it feared that the entry of AirAsia India could cause existing airlines to incur further losses, according to PTI.\n\nThis isn't the first time AirAsia has run into problems regarding a foreign operation. In 2012, it ran into turbulence from Indonesian regulators after it proposed to buy into Batavia Air for US$80 million, and although it got the nod finally, the deal was mutually aborted over price.\n\nTony Fernandes, the maverick founder of the airline, didn't respond to texts from BT but Bernama reported that AirAsia India was unperturbed by the various legal challenges and is aiming for a May start.\n\n\"We may get the air operator permit (AOP) in about three weeks. Thereafter, we may commence operations in two months from Chennai,\" its chief executive officer Mittu Chandilya was quoted by The Hindu newspaper as saying in an interview in Chennai on Wednesday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Bedok, Bukit Batok, Choa Chu Kang, Geylang, Jurong West, Tampines and Yishun had zero overall median COV.\n\nWith COVs for resale flats falling to zero for the first time since 2006 when SRX began collecting COV records, some analysts are predicting that COVs will slip into negative territory as early as this month.\n\n\"Recent policies have shut down the heavy demand for HDB resale flats from foreigners and on top of that, there may be some pressures from those selling their HDB flats to upgrade to their private properties when these are completed,\" said Alan Cheong, director for research and consultancy at Savills Singapore.\n\nThe three-year waiting period for permanent residents (PRs) to buy resale flats has been a major turn-off for many PRs and the tightening of PR renewals has also resulted in fewer people being eligible for HDB resale flats.\n\nIf traditionally hot estates such as Bishan, Queenstown and Toa Payoh start seeing zero or negative COVs, that would be a \"time of reckoning\", Mr Cheong said.\n\nOng Kah Seng, director of R'ST Research, said he expects zero COV for flats with no more than four rooms in average locations such as Sengkang, Punggol, Hougang and Serangoon.\n\nLarger flats (five-room and executive flats) in average locations and flats in far-flung areas, such as Bukit Batok, Sembawang, Woodlands and Jurong West, are likely to be transacted at slightly below valuation price, Mr Ong predicted.\n\nA negative or zero COV will be a psychological barrier to sellers, he said. \"Only sellers in a hurry to dispose of their flat, such as moving into completed BTO flat, or executive condominium, or who really want to sell off their flat after they move into their new completed private condominium, will relent to notable resale price at below valuation price.\"\n\nMr Ong believes prices may fall by around 5 per cent for the first half of 2014 before they stabilise. When demand picks up from the middle of 2014, sellers may not raise their prices aggressively in view of the 30 per cent cap for the mortgage servicing ratio (MSR) on buyers.\n\nBut analysts note that the weakness in the HDB resale market will not necessarily spill over to the private residential market.\n\nERA Realty key executive officer Eugene Lim said he does not foresee a spillover effect in private home sales since half of private home buyers already have private addresses.\n\nWhile there will likely be more deals closed at or below valuation as sellers become more realistic, Mr Lim said he prefers to wait for further clarity in figures for the second quarter of this year as February is traditionally a slow month because of the Chinese New Year.\n\nMr Ong of R'ST Research noted that loan limit under the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework has a greater bearing on private residential demand.\n\nHDB upgraders generally have the option of renting out their flat to foreigners or go for more affordable executive condominiums, he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

City of love? Music and wine? Or a city of strikes and rude baguette-carrying locals?\n\nThere is no shortage of stereotypes when it comes to the French - in fact, there are probably enough to make up a cabaret production. Behold, A Singaporean in Paris - a production by Sing'theatre which enjoyed a successful sell-out debut in 2010, and which will be restaged at the School Of The Arts (SOTA) Drama Theatre next week.\n\nA Singaporean in Paris is a musical comedy following the story of a Singaporean artist, played by comedian Hossan Leong, who goes to Paris with dreams of \"making it big\" in the City of Light. There he joins a cabaret and befriends fellow aspiring artists - played by Peter Ong, Mina Kaye and Linden Furnell - while encountering culture shock and language barriers along the way.\n\n\"It's a story about a Singaporean, about friendship, and about France. And mostly about how we have all these misconceptions or expectations of Paris,\" says Leong, who will also be directing.\n\nAccording to Leong, he intends to stick to the original storyline as much as possible, while at the same time putting his own spin on it. It will be different from the late Christina Sergeant's original version, he adds, and this includes working with a different cast and adding new songs such as Les Comediens by French singer-songwriter Charles Aznavour.\n\nHe reveals that one example of the myths that will be debunked is that of the French as a rude and arrogant people.\n\n\"I don't get any racist comments from French people,\" he insists. \"People say it's because I speak French, but well when you go to a foreign country, shouldn't you at least try? People appreciate that. Go into a shop and say \"Bonjour\", and service will be 100 per cent better. No one is ever rude or arrogant on purpose.\"\n\nBut while all the myths are fun to discuss, all of it is ultimately part of a bigger goal that Leong has in mind - which is to bring up the more deep-rooted issues he has noticed about living in Singapore by comparing it with a Singaporean living in Paris.\n\nHe explains: \"There's something about cities like Paris, New York, and London, that Singapore is slowly starting to have. Things break down, there are riots, immigration problems, integration problems, poverty. But it doesn't mean it's the end of the world.\n\n\"We say we're a first-world country, so these are the first-world problems that will inevitably come along with it. So face it, and take the good with the bad. If you want to be a first-world country and get rid of these problems, then I think this is Utopia already,\" he adds with a laugh.\n\nA Singaporean in Paris runs from March 11 - 23 at the SOTA Drama Theatre at 8pm from Tues to Sun, with an additional 4pm show on Sat and Sun.

We are still controlling shareholders and remain very confident in the Group's growth prospects,\" said Tony Bin, who is representing Centurion Properties Pte Ltd.\n\nThe new shareholding structure will increase Centurion's free float to 29 per cent, from 24 per cent.\n\nCenturion's chief executive officer Kong Chee Min added: \"We are pleased to welcome Lian Beng as our substantial shareholder. Our joint venture has been a success and their coming on board as a shareholder further strengthens our working relationship.\"\n\nCenturion has a 45:55 joint venture with Lian Beng in Lian Beng-Centurion (Mandai) Pte Ltd which owns a 141-unit ramp-up industrial building and a workers' accommodation in Mandai. All the units in the ramp-up industrial building have been fully sold, while the workers' accommodation - Westlite Mandai - became fully operational last year with 6,300 beds.\n\nCenturion has a portfolio of 19,700 and 13,500 beds in Singapore and Malaysia, respectively. It is expected to grow to a total of over 50,000 beds by the end of 2015.\n\nAnalysts were mostly positive on the news, which has sent the share prices of Centurion and Lian Beng higher after the trading halts were lifted at 2.30pm yesterday.\n\n\"The vendor placement is more of a strategic move than a cashing out by the majority shareholders,\" said an analyst. \"The aim is to boost liquidity and also better align the interests of the two companies. It makes sense.\"\n\nThe joint venture, Westlite Mandai, is expected to contribute about 15 per cent of Centurion's FY 2014 pre-tax profit.\n\nCenturion reported revenues of $66.4 million and record net profits of $92.2 million for FY2013. Excluding the fair value gains and the joint venture's investment properties of $77.2 million as well as the one-off impairment charge of $3.9 million, net profit was $18.8 million.\n\nCenturion shares, which were trading around 61 cents each before trading was halted at 11.30am yesterday, ended at 65 cents each, up four cents or 6.6 per cent. Lian Beng closed at 55.5 centse, up 2.5 cents or 4.7 per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The rouble-traded MICEX lost 2.2 per cent on the news to trade at 1,321.1 points.\n\nThe sudden acceleration of moves to bring Crimea, which has an ethnic Russian majority and has effectively been seized by Russian forces, formally under Moscow's rule came as European Union leaders gathered for an emergency summit to seek ways to pressure Russia to back down and accept mediation.\n\nThe Crimean parliament voted unanimously \"to enter into the Russian Federation with the rights of a subject of the Russian Federation\". The vice-premier of Crimea, home to Russia's Black Sea military base in Sevastopol, said that a referendum on the status would take place on March 16.\n\nThe announcement, which diplomats said could not have been made without Russian President Vladimir Putin's approval, raised the stakes in the most serious east-west confrontation since the end of the Cold War.\n\nThe new Ukrainian government has declared the referendum illegal and opened a criminal investigation against Crimean Prime Minister Sergei Askyonov, who was appointed by the region's parliament last week. The Ukrainian government does not recognise his authority or that of the parliament.\n\nA Crimean parliament official said that voters will be asked two questions: should Crimea be part of the Russian Federation and should Crimea return to an earlier constitution (1992) that gave the region more autonomy?\n\n\"If there weren't constant threats from the current illegal Ukrainian authorities, maybe we would have taken a different path,\" deputy parliament speaker Sergei Tsekov told reporters outside the parliament building in Crimea's main city of Simferopol. \"I think there was an annexation of Crimea by Ukraine, if we are going to call things by their name. \"\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday said that there was so far no agreement between Moscow and Washington on the situation in Ukraine, after talks in Rome with US Secretary of State John Kerry. \"We agreed that we will study further those thoughts that John Kerry gave me today about concrete prospective steps,\" Mr Lavrov said, according to Interfax news agency.\n\nThe United States has said that it is ready to impose sanctions such as visa bans, asset freezes on individual Russian officials and restrictions on business ties within days rather than weeks. - Reuters, AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

It also gives me an excuse to go down to the cellar and survey the wines. That is my twice or thrice weekly exercise! Questions to be answered which determine choice of wine: Lunch or dinner? Casual or formal? Where are we eating? Guest list? Any special occasion - birthday; anniversary?\n\nStarting with the most frequent occasion, an informal meal, and a casual dinner with good friends. Last evening it was dinner for a very old friend and her daughter, just the four of us. Our guests drink wines with their meals but are not collectors.\n\nIt was a matter of choosing more commonly seen wines, the type you knew they would have experienced more often. This thus meant Burgundy for white and Bordeaux for red. The food was more Western in character so it was not difficult to find wines to match. First course was fish with stuffed zucchini flower, followed by pasta and finally beef.\n\nChampagne to begin with is de rigueur. Champagne Pol Roger NV, popularly known as \"white foil\" for obvious reasons, but these days the white foil has been replaced by a more elegant greyish foil, giving it a classier look. It lived up to expectations. A brisk lively bubbly, nice fruit, impressive freshness combined to make a most pleasing aperitif.\n\nFor the white, a Meursault Clos de la Barre 1997, Domaine Comtes Lafon, which I felt was time to be drunk as at 16 years it would be sufficiently mature. It proved to be exactly that, at its peak, an impressive light golden colour. A nutty citrus-like bouquet, indicating maturity, a medium-weight body which had a base of savoury nuttiness overlaid by a rich orangey flavour, an assertive taste, a wine at its peak and proud of it. Delicious.\n\nThe pasta and beef courses were washed down with Chateau Angelus 1999. I wanted a soft, fruity wine which would be easy to appreciate and drink, something uncomplicated. And from Bordeaux as its label would be more easily recognisable than a Spanish or Italian.\n\nA 14-year old Bordeaux from the right bank with its high Merlot content would likely be more appealing and acceptable than a left bank Chateau with its drier Cabernet Sauvignon predominance. The Angelus performed as expected, an easy to appreciate wine, quite full-bodied, attractive aroma of ripe berries and plummy fruit, quite but not fully developed. Seemed to be a little lacking in full ripeness but this impression may be due to a little immaturity. Would be interesting to try another bottle soon.\n\nA few nights ago, another Bordeaux, an old friend, Chateau Rauzan Segla 1986 which I came across in browsing through the cellar. I had not seen this for eons, and as it was a small family dinner, just the right occasion. 1986 was a renowned vintage for Rauzan Segla in the pre-Chanel era - before the Wertheimer family bought the luxury fashion house. This would be a wine typical of the old-fashioned Bordeaux, the type most of us were brought up on - classic, reserved, aristocratic. A good example of the Margaux style of wines. As dinner was barbecued Japanese chicken from Nagoya, with noodles, the wine would be a good match.\n\nChateau Rauzan Segla 1986\n\nNote: Bought 1997 from Seckford, well-known English wine merchant, brought back by air in 2000 (no consolidated reefer in those days!).\n\nMedium-dark brownish red, fresh aroma of old matured Bordeaux wine, very characteristic cedarwood, cigar-box aroma. On the palate, a typical matured old-style Bordeaux, ripe fruit in a rather reserved, aristocratic, classic style typical of that period. Well-balanced medium-bodied, not tannic, good freshness, medium length clean finish. Fully mature, at peak and holding well at 27 years old. It may lack appeal for those more familiar with the popular fuller-bodied, softer style of wines. A style which I would not recommend for spicy Asian cuisines.\n\nAnother small family dinner last week, with very typical Hokkien food - fish, Henghua noodles, and barbecued chicken wings - white wine this time.\n\nRiesling Cuvee Catherine 1990, Domaine Weinbach\n\nOne of the last few bottles from a case purchased in 1995 from the local agent then.\n\nThis was beautiful. Brilliant golden colour, with a rich and fresh aroma of ripe fruit, including plums. On the palate, first impression was of great freshness, beautifully ripe fruit, well balanced, very complex, and long lingering finish. For Riesling lovers an example of a great Riesling. For those not familiar or who do not understand Rieslings, this provides the perfect answer.\n\nSince the sadly premature death of Theo Faller in 1979, this Domaine has been run by three lovely ladies, widow and mother Colette Faller and two daughters, Catherine, who directs the marketing and sales and Laurence, the wine-maker. A formidable trio, their charm belying their brilliance, competence and single-mindedness.\n\nBetween them they have taken this estate to the very top of the Alsace tree, and acknowledged as one of the great estates of the world. It is also a firm favourite of mine, a visit to the Faller winery always a compulsory fixture on my Alsace visit.\n\nTastings of their wines are held in the parlour of their home, and while you taste the wines, the indefatigable Colette descends into the cellar repeatedly to come up with an almost never-ending succession of bottles, and you also know you are expected to stay for dinner. You leave with warm memories of three very warm and lovely friends, and of more than three glorious wines!\n\nOver the Chinese New Year we had the perennial raw fish salad - more than once. It is actually a very tasty vegetable salad, made more interesting with slices of raw fish.\n\nTo justify the price (high) some restaurants go upmarket with the fish supplied, using salmon or tuna. The sauce which is poured over the small mountain of vegetables and fish is sweet with a slightly sourish element, but mainly sweet. Over the years I have used German Kabinetts and Spaetleses, even Ausleses, the last-named seemingly best able to cope with the sweetness of the salad.\n\nUntil this year! Quite by accident I drank an Italian Moscato with the salad. And it hit the right spot! The lightly sweet Moscato with its fresh acidity and its bubbles was a very agreeable wine with which to wash down the salad.\n\nI could not believe my palate. Carefully drinking the Moscato to accompany a mouthful of the raw fish salad, I re-affirmed for myself that it was really a better fit than the German Spaetlese. Eureka! QED!\n\nI knew what had been missing in all earlier selections - Kabinett, Spaetlese, and Auslese. Bubbles! The sweetness of this wine is between a Spaetlese and an Auslese, it is the addition of the bubbles which adds the lightness and liveliness which help to make this wine a more agreeable companion to the salad.

The overall median COV for HDB resale flats slumped from $32,000 a year ago to hit zero last month.\n\nMr Lim said that the HDB was trying to improve market transparency when it started publishing COV tables for the different estates and flat types to educate the public and address the perception that COVs were too high. \"But people then started to use that as a benchmark and mark up their prices above it. The COV price becomes the registered price and the next valuation becomes higher.\n\n\"Now, if the reverse catches momentum, many flat owners will suffer because the prices will shoot downwards. It's timely to take out the cash over valuation and cash under valuation figures. Just publish market price.\"\n\nSome members of Parliament have, in the past, suggested scrapping official COV figures as they believe it contributes psychologically to rising HDB resale prices.\n\nBut the government had responded that people would calculate those figures themselves even if HDB did not publish them. The COV is not mandatory in a resale transaction and the HDB does not determine the resale price, which is agreed between a willing buyer and a willing seller.\n\nSome property analysts felt that COV remains relevant in today's market.\n\nOng Kah Seng, director of R'ST Research, noted that COVs have a role to play, serving as a \"brake to over-buying during average and buoyant market conditions\", despite being blamed for being a psychological benchmark that drives COVs and selling prices higher.\n\nEven with the cooling measures and dampened buying sentiment, the COV mechanism can still act as a reference point for buyers and sellers, he said.\n\n\"A zero or negative COV now (and going forward) will signal to buyers that resale flat prices seem quite affordable, and can reduce the possibility of sellers having to relent to endless requests for low or very low prices.\"\n\nAlan Cheong, director for research and consultancy at Savills Singapore, noted that \"COVs have a role to play in setting the benchmark for subsequent valuations down the road\" as valuations tend to be backward-looking.\n\n\"They should leave COVs alone. There are many measures that are administrative in nature that choke the free market mechanism,\" he said. \"Let's work within the existing framework and calibrate it.\"\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

In a March 4 filing of Form 1 under the Securities and Futures Act, Kreuz executive director and CEO Kurush Phiroze Contractor gave notice of the disposal of 26,970,000 shares or 4.84 per cent in Kreuz at $0.80 each, or a gross consideration of $21.6 million. According to the filing, the disposal was part of the takeover offer from SEA9 by way of a scheme of arrangement under Section 210 of the Companies Act.\n\nSimilarly, Kreuz's vice-president of offshore subsea installations, Sheldon Richard Hutton, also gave notice of the disposal of his holdings of 32,610,000 shares or 5.85 per cent in Kreuz, also at $0.80 per share or a total of $26.1 million.\n\nKreuz's vice-president of offshore subsea operations, Cyrus Phiroze Cama, another substantial shareholder, gave notice of the divestment of his stake of 28,618,000 shares or 5.14 per cent at $0.80 per share or a total of $22.9 million.\n\nThe three executives, being \"key executive employees\", had also on the announcement date entered into employment undertakings with the company and SEA9 and SEA11. Also, under a CEO subscription agreement, Mr Kurush Contractor has agreed to subscribe for new SEA9 shares, giving him an approximate 4.34 per cent stake.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The rationale for SRC, the strategic direction for which was crafted by the advisory unit of Maybank, was that having a government-controlled resource-management firm would ensure the stability of the supply chain of resources deemed crucial for the country's economic growth.\n\nThis was articulated by 1MDB in the firm's business case for a strategic resource company, which was submitted to the government in 2010 alongside an application for a loan to \"quickly execute\" some strategic moves in the resources space globally.\n\nSRC was set up on Jan 7, 2011 with a paid-up capital of RM2. Seven months later, this was increased to RM1 million. Yet, just about a year after it was set up, SRC was transferred to the Ministry of Finance, the sole shareholder of 1MDB.\n\nThis only adds to the mounting questions over 1MDB, which, according to insiders, are stirring unease in the country's corporate and political landscape.\n\nEarlier last year, 1MDB shot back in its defence that allegations over its investment moves were \"baseless\". It added that US$2.318 billion in funds under its management, which were proceeds and profits from its 1MDB-PetroSaudi international joint venture - another deal that has been panned - were \"safe\".\n\n\"This fact is clearly reported in the company's audited account that is publicly available from the Companies Commission of Malaysia and has been independently audited by a global reputable and established firm,\" it said.\n\nBut there are gaps, such as the lack of public disclosure about SRC, the loan it secured from the Malaysian government and how it has since utilised the funds.\n\nSRC's 2012 accounts lodged with the Companies Commission of Malaysia in fact show that its non-current liabilities stood at some RM4 billion and it had current assets of RM3.8 billion. The company did not generate any revenue in that year.\n\nDocuments obtained by BT reveal that SRC had planned to invest in a Mongolian mining firm Gobi Coal & Energy for around US$45 million in a pre-initial public offering (IPO) placement.\n\nBut the Ulaanbaatar-based firm, whose owners include the Beijing-based private equity firm Origo Partners plc, scrapped its listing plans in 2011, given the moribund equity markets; Gobi Coal & Energy reportedly hired Goldman Sachs to help it find a buyer.\n\nIt is not clear if this investment went through.\n\nSRC was also given in-principle approval to invest some US$150 million in Indonesia coal miner PT ABM Investama TBK's IPO, but this investment did not materialise.\n\n1MDB did not respond to BT's queries on SRC.\n\nMany of 1MDB's investments have complex structures involving special-purpose vehicles, some of which are set up in the British Virgin Islands with offshore banking accounts.\n\nIn some ways, SRC is no different.\n\nAccording to the documents, another vehicle SRC International (Malaysia) Ltd (SRCI), was registered in the British Virgin Islands with the aim of exploring international investments in the energy-and-resources sector.\n\nIn 2011, SRCI and Abu Dhabi's global investment firm, Aabar Investments PJS, formed a joint venture called Aabar-SRC Global Resources (ASRC), under which each party would contribute US$500 million in cash into the JV.\n\nSources said it was approved that SRCI would set up and maintain operating accounts holding some US$500 million in a Swiss private bank in Dubai.\n\nThis tie-up followed up on the close strategic relations between the governments of Malaysia and Abu Dhabi, and has since deepened significantly.\n\nLast March, 1MDB raised US$3 billion through private placements to fund its investments in energy and real-estate projects under a tie-up with Abu Dhabi to invest up to RM18 billion in these areas. Then, the hefty fees coughed up by the fund for the bond issue arranged by United States bank Goldman Sachs raised red flags.\n\nSeveral opposition politicians have been relentless in their criticism of 1MDB. More recently, the fund's move to switch auditors - it has done so twice already - and the news that it has put funds worth a whopping US$2.32 billion in the Cayman Islands appears to have rattled market observers.\n\nAt the heart of these mounting questions, say market observers, are concerns about whether the funds are effectively being utilised and if they are in safe-keeping.\n\nState-linked funds in Malaysia have in the past come under fire for their investment decisions. This is no different for sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional or the Employees Provident Fund, the country's retirement fund.\n\nBut these funds not only publish their annual reports, they articulate their investment guidelines and decisions in greater detail.\n\nThis is less so in the case of 1MDB since its set-up five years ago.\n\nOn the back of criticism for its failing to release its latest financial accounts, 1MDB has since clarified that it has been given until March 31 to file its annual returns, given the change in business direction following its purchase of substantial power assets.\n\nIt appointed Deloitte to complete its audit for the year ended March 2013 after having parted ways with its auditor KPMG, in what was described as a \"mutually agreed\" decision.\n\nNow, there is an added sense of urgency in the air for 1MDB, which is readying its power assets for a mega IPO.\n\nInvestment bankers are rubbing their hands with glee at the pickings to come from such a sizeable offering, which is estimated to raise some US$2 billion.\n\nBut the fund had paid almost RM11 billion and a huge premium for these old plants, which, on their own, are unlikely to whet investors' appetite for the stock offering, said a banker.\n\nRecent news that 1MDB (with Japan's Mitsui Co) pipped early favourite YTL Power International (which teamed up with the Sultan of Johor) to bag the country's much-vaunted multi-billion ringgit 2,000 MW coal-fired power plant could significantly sweeten the impending offering slated for sometime this year.\n\nNews reports say that the YTL-Sultan of Johor joint venture had submitted a lower bid than the 1MDB-Mitsui team, but there were other technical factors that could have clinched it for 1MDB a week ago.\n\nPressure appears to be mounting now for the country's Energy Commission to provide more explanation on the award.\n\nAttention could soon shift to another project - the building of a 1,000 mw gas-fired power plant or Project 4A - and who would bag the job. Governance hawks are watching the process closely.\n\n\"This project should be awarded on an open basis with sufficient disclosures.\n\n\"If it doesn't, it may make the administration's promise for more transparency as part of its national transformation programme sound hollow,\" said an observer.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Parking is better too, with carpark space in the surrounding skyscrapers and the open-air carpark next to MBS.\n\nFestival organiser Savour Events hopes to bring in 18,000 people this year to top last year's attendance of 16,000. To accommodate the increase, the festival has been expanded from six sessions over four days last year to span nine sessions of both lunches and dinners over five days this year. Tickets for dinner sessions today and tomorrow sold out early on, while others are selling fast.\n\nBesides a 140-seater auditorium and a cooking studio for masterclasses and pop-up kitchens where vistors can sample signature dishes from visiting chefs for $6 to $18, there's also a two-storey arcade showcasing independent gourmet food purveyors and a 1,500 sq m indoor produce market by Jason's The Gourmet Grocer. Visiting chefs include Mark Best of Marque in Sydney, Danish chef Henrik Yde of one-Michelin-starred Thai restaurant Kiin Kiin in Copenhagen, and British chefs Mark Sargeant and Michael Caines of two-Michelin starred Gidleigh Park. Tickets start at $45 for lunch and $65 for dinner.\n\nIf there's any nitpicking to be done, it would be the heavy emphasis on chefs from predictable dining destinations such as Australia and the United Kingdom, in contrast to previous editions, which welcomed chefs from more far-flung locales such as South Africa, Sweden, Finland and Peru.\n\nBut that's a move that event organisers say is deliberate. \"We want to move away from chasing the Michelin stars and the awards and bring in more up-and-coming chefs such as James Knappett,\" says Savour's executive director, Darren Chen, who estimates the entire festival cost about $2 million to stage.\n\nMr Knappett of gourmet hot dog and champagne joint, Bubbledogs, and tastings restaurant, the Kitchen Table, says he agreed to come to Singapore for the first time as it was \"a good way to see if foreign markets are ready for our food concept.\" Likewise for Han Liguang of month-old degustation-only restaurant, Labyrinth, who showcased his progressive modern Singaporean signature dishes such as a soft shell crab served with chilli crab ice-cream and chendol xiaolong bao, alongside other young local chefs such as Daniel Sia of the Disgruntled Chef and Mervyn Phan of Grub: \"It's a low-risk way for diners to try our food. If they like what they see, they can come to our restaurant for the full experience.\"\n\nDiners also get to preview soon-to-be-introduced dishes from top restaurants at Savour, such as tempura-battered fingers of creamy foie gras ($18) from Saint Pierre and meltingly tender cubes of miso-marinated sous vide wagyu from Japanese restaurant Mikuni's upcoming Spring menu, a steal at just $10. Other unmissable dishes include the cheese-crusted eclair filled with a garlicky pesto and tomato-dressed escargots from Tokyo-based French chef Christophe Paucod of the one Michelin star Lugdunum Bouchon Lyonnais, and the umami-packed toro and black truffle-topped shrimp vermicelli from three Michelin-starred Bo Innovation from Hong Kong, returning to Savour for the third year.\n\nFirst-time Savour participant, Bruno Menard of La Cantine and &Made in Singapore, says it was a refreshing experience presenting his food in a street-food format, served in disposable bowls and eaten with plastic cutlery.\n\n\"Events like Savour are complementary to other fine dining-focused food festivals such as the World Gourmet Summit and part of the evolution of dining in Singapore to include more variety,\" he says. \"Plus, it's exciting for me to be able to meet a new segment of diners. People may be too shy to talk to chefs in a restaurant, but in a casual, social setting like this, it may be less intimidating. And that's what food should be about - communicating ideas.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

One genco chief said that it may have been hot, but it was also windy.\n\nThe generating companies are, however, on the alert for the return of the haze, which affects the efficiency of their combined-cycle gas turbines. The power industry officials were responding to the latest reports that only 0.2 mm of rain was recorded here last month - well below the mean February rainfall of 161 mm.\n\nThe National Environment Agency (NEA) said that last month was the country's driest since 1869.\n\nThe genco chief said that wholesale electricity prices, however, stayed stable, averaging between $150 and $160 per megawatt hour (MWh) last month; only once did the price spike past $200/MWh, and this was due to a plant outage. He noted that February also tends to be a low electricity- demand month, especially with the Chinese New Year holiday break.\n\nThis compares with last June and August when the haze was at its worst. Electricity prices were at around $200/MWh then, and demand peaked, especially with air-conditioners at full blast amid the mid-year heat and the haze.\n\nThe genco chief, referring to the potential for dust particles from the haze being sucked into the filters of the gencos' gas turbines and compromising their performance, said: \"That's why we're on the alert again in case the haze returns.\"\n\nA second genco chief told The Business Times that this is why regulator Energy Market Authority now has rules requiring the gencos\n\nto set aside a complete set of spare air filters for each unit they have. He added that the gencos' need for water to cool their power plants is also not an issue in the ongoing drought because all power stations here are built by the sea and pump seawater into their plants for this purpose. They also make use of Newater for their boilers.\n\nNeighbouring Indonesia's Riau province has recently been shrouded in a dense haze, as farmers there set fires to clear land. The NEA, detecting 48 hot spots in Sumatra on Tuesday, has warned that the choking smog could hit Singapore again once the winds shift.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Airline-specific rooms are a further option as Stansted seeks to broaden its offering, said Andrew Harrison, the site's managing director.\n\nMAG aims to expand Stansted traffic by luring heavyweight airlines such as Emirates of Dubai, the No 1 on international routes, after deals to boost flights at Ryanair and EasyJet, Europe's top discount operators.\n\nWhile keen to draw new clients, other enhancements spanning security checks to retail areas should appeal across the board, Mr Harrison said.\n\n\"The way we see the terminal operating is with a great level of service for everybody, but with the opportunity for the full-service airlines to differentiate,\" he said. \"They've got to be convinced that the market exists and the catchment area is strong enough.\"\n\nStansted lifted passenger numbers 2.2 per cent to 17.8 million last year, barely half the 35 million it could potentially handle within the limits of existing planning restrictions, Mr Harrison said. That means the single-runway site can easily accommodate extra flights even as London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports struggle to add operating slots.\n\nEmirates already serves MAG's Manchester base using Airbus A380s. Other long-haul clients include rival Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways, as well as American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Air Canada Rouge, Singapore Airlines and Virgin Atlantic Airways.\n\nAccess to the lounge costs \u00a317.49 per person and offers complimentary pastries, sandwiches and drinks, together with more substantial meals for an extra fee. Several carriers at the airport also have their own lounges.\n\nLong-haul passengers are attractive to airports because they tend to arrive earlier at the terminal, taking more time there and spending more on retail, food and beverage purchases for use or consumption during their trip, according to an Airport Cooperative Research Program report published in 2012.\n\nSince agreeing to buy Stansted for \u00a31.5 billion in January 2013, MAG has embarked on a programme of upgrades to the 23-year-old terminal building designed by UK architect Norman Foster, who went on to build new hubs in Hong Kong and Beijing.- Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

Other members include NATS UK chief Richard Deakin, International Air Transport Association (Iata) regional director Ken McLean and the Singapore Air Force's Chief of Staff (Air Staff), BG Lim Yeong Kiat.\n\nCAAS is providing $50 million over five years to fund R&D activities undertaken by the ATMRI as well as ATM experts for the research projects, while NTU is providing in-kind contributions, such as research manpower and facilities, worth $22 million. The ATMRI will have an office and laboratory of more than 1,000 square metres of space at NTU.\n\n\"Today, the Asia-Pacific region is the world's largest market for air transport, ahead of Europe and the US.

Initial areas of study will include air-ground traffic management and aircraft separation management.\n\nThe ATMRI will be holding a seminar on \"Perspectives on Seamless Air Traffic Management\" at NTU on March 25, bringing together experts from the ATM field. Speakers will come from organisations such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the US Federal Aviation Administration and Thales.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

While the government will continue to try to mitigate business cycles by stepping in when the market heats up, the only permanent solution to address climbing costs is to raise productivity, said Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam yesterday.\n\n\"Demand in the economy is strong (as seen in) demand for resources, especially (for) labour and space. And that's why costs are ticking up fundamentally. The wrong strategy will be to weaken our economy . . . That's not what our business community wants, and that's not what Singaporeans want.\n\n\"We've got to keep this a vibrant place - keep a check on costs to make sure they don't rise consistently, (and) foster business profits for wages. That's our strategy. But accept that we are not going to be a cheap location for business,\" said Mr Tharman.\n\nHe cited Hong Kong and Japan, which tackled the issue of rental pressures differently. The former has let market forces prevail, which pushed retail rents up to the extent that businesses have restructured themselves to shift away from traditional clientele and services to cater to the high-end Chinese market.\n\n\"And many Hong Kong residents are not very happy about that,\" said Mr Tharman, who noted that prime retail rents in Hong Kong are more than seven times the price of those in Singapore.\n\nJapan, on the other hand, through its practice of rental protection, has allowed \"charming little ramen shops\" and mom-and- pop shops to survive. But that has come with trade- offs: rents may be cheap, but wages are stagnant, and opportunities for Japan's young are limited.\n\nSaid Mr Tharman: \"Those are two quite different approaches, and I think we should avoid either extreme. Don't just leave it to the market, but neither can we fix rents and keep prices low.\"\n\nHe said the government has \"(tried to) mitigate the cycles\" by increasing the supply of factory and shop spaces, which should have a \"moderating impact on rentals\".\n\n\"That's our strategy. We don't have perfect foresight, but when we see the market heating up, we take action to boost supply and find other ways to help businesses to mitigate costs.\"\n\nStill, he said, \"the only permanent solution\" to address rising business costs is to raise productivity.\n\n\"As long as we remain vibrant as an economy, our cost will basically approach that of an advanced country - a little higher in some areas, a little lower in some areas - but basically, we will have advanced country costs.\n\n\"And the only way for businesses to survive (in that environment) is to have advanced country capabilities in innovation, in the commercialisation of R&D (research and development), in managerial skills and in investing in employees so that they have deep skills. That's the only way.\"\n\nWhile the government has thus far pushed for restructuring via tighter foreign worker policies and schemes to help businesses upgrade, Mr Tharman said the next phase of restructuring will focus on transforming SMEs, jobs and workplace norms. This will include placing greater emphasis on continuing education and developing \"obsolescence-proof skills\" for a new technology-driven world economy.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/listed-warrants-still-zone", "site_title": "Listed warrants still in the zone", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nListed warrants still in the zone\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Mar 5, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nA FEW local companies have been raising funds through rights issues that come with unlisted, free warrants as \"sweeteners\" to ensure the rights are taken up. These novel instruments were featured in this column recently, but equally interesting is that dozens of local companies have also raised funds via rights issues that include listed warrants with intriguing features of their own.\n\nA good example is Sinarmas Land's warrant, which expires in November 2015 and is the only pure \"European-style\" warrant listed here. (The letter \"e\" next to its description on the Singapore Exchange's website denotes this feature.)\n\nUnlike the more common \"American-style\" instrument, the Sinarmas warrant can only be converted to shares upon expiry. In theory, this should not have a major influence on its price. In practice, it could play a part; add the exercise price of 10 cents to the warrant's price of 28.5 cents, and we find that there is a 10-cent (21 per cent) conversion discount to the shares at 48.5 cents.\n\nWarrant traders might reason that a deep-in-the-money instrument like this (that is, one in which the shares have risen way above the exercise price) can be expected to trade at a discount, but you would have to wonder whether 21 per cent is perhaps too large, and whether its European convertibility feature is a factor behind the discount.\n\nIf it is, then it suggests that the local market may be lacking in sophistication or efficiency.\n\nElsewhere, Second Chance Properties' 2017 warrant is just as unique because it has both European and American properties, that is, it cannot be exercised in the first four years from 2012, but can be converted any time in the remaining year from 2016 by payment of the 40-cent exercise price.\n\nLike the Sinarmas warrant, Second Chance's European-style feature could be why it is not that liquid and sells for a slight discount: add the warrant price of five cents to the 40-cent conversion price and you get 45 cents, a 3.2 per cent discount to the shares at 46.5 cents. But once the American-style feature comes into force, this could change.\n\nThere are many low-priced warrants that are almost purely American-style and are interesting because they satisfy two critical criteria for attractiveness:\n\nOf course, this does not automatically assure upside because everything depends on the performance of the underlying shares, but these two features by themselves should guarantee some level of interest among traders who are looking for cheap, leveraged plays on any possible recovery in the second or third line.\n\nOne of the cheapest in absolute terms is Acma's new warrant, which expires in July 2016, giving it 28 months to expiration. It costs just 0.8 of a cent. In the world of warrant pricing, \"cheap\" is a relative term. When added to the conversion price of 3.5 cents, this warrant commands a 43 per cent conversion premium over the shares at three cents, a premium that some might consider too rich.\n\nHowever, in return, the buyer enjoys gearing of (3/0.8) 3.75 times, which is pretty decent since it means, on average, that a one per cent move in Acma's shares should translate to a 3.75 per cent move in the warrant.\n\nIn practice, this may not always be the case, so traders tend to adjust the gearing by taking into consideration recent movements in the warrant versus the shares, in order to arrive at \"effective gearing\", typically seen as giving a more realistic idea of how much the warrants might move when the shares move.\n\nIn Acma's case, Bloomberg pegs the effective gearing at about 2.2 - arguably still appealing, given the low capital outlay needed to buy one warrant and the fact that the shares at one time used to trade at more than $7 (before splits and various other capital-changing exercises).\n\nOne of the market's favourite trading stocks is Rowsley Ltd, which costs 28 cents. Those who might want to bank on the shares performing in the next few months could consider Rowsley's warrant, which can be exercised from April 3, expires in October 2016 and is in the money since it carries an exercise price of 18 cents. At 10 cents, it commands no conversion premium, yet offers 2.8 (28/10) times gearing.\n\nAs always though, the proviso is that traders should study the fundamentals of the issuing companies and not over-extend themselves when trading warrants. Attractive and interesting though they may appear, they are still leveraged instruments and care needs to be taken when investing in them.\n\nSo despite the generally subdued market sentiment, the warrant sector still offers a good bet or two.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With fliers ready to spend more, investing in the customer experience goes hand in hand with savings, he said.\n\n\"We can't compete with these Gulf and Asian carriers without providing the best service and product in class,\" Mr de Juniac, 51, said on Tuesday. .\n\nIn betting the carrier's future on premium fliers, Mr de Juniac faces long-haul competitors such as Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines that upgraded their jets earlier. Paris-based Air France-KLM posted five annual losses in six years as labour spending topped fuel, a reversal of the situation in the newly efficient US industry.\n\n\"We were heading to bankruptcy,\" said Mr de Juniac, who took the top job at Air-France-KLM after heading the Air France unit for about a year and a half.\n\nAfter being late to the game with luxury appointments now standard on carriers including Emirates and Singapore Airlines, Air France-KLM is spending one billion euros (S$1.74 billion) over three to four years to gussy up its long-haul fleet.\n\nFully reclining business-class seats will be longer than those offered by competitors, with down pillows and comforters, bigger media screens and the new menus, Mr de Juniac said. He said he personally insisted on more room for fliers' feet.\n\n\"We think people are fed up with being badly treated,\" Mr de Juniac said. \"People will be willing to spend a little more on their plane ticket.\"\n\nPassengers flying abroad in premium-class seats rose 4.2 per cent in 2013 from a year earlier, according to the International Air Transport Association. The North Atlantic market, the biggest by revenue and one where Air France-KLM competes, rose 2.4 per cent after gaining just 0.6 per cent a year earlier when Europe was mired in recession.\n\nHigher fares on long-distance flights make premium passengers especially valuable. Of 15 million travellers on those flights for Air France last year, the 1.6 million fliers who used business class contributed one-third of revenue, the company has said.\n\nInvestors are starting to warm to Air France-KLM's turnaround plans, sending the stock to a 22 per cent gain through Tuesday in the past 12 months. That was enough for 11th place among 30 carriers in the Bloomberg World Airlines Index. France's CAC All-Tradable Index rose 20 per cent in the same period.\n\nAir France-KLM has also started to forge commercial partnerships to strengthen its position in markets outside Europe, where passenger traffic growth is sluggish and competition from low-cost rivals is fierce.\n\n\"Africa will be on the line of the horizon,\" Mr de Juniac said. Air France-KLM already has an agreement to share booking codes with Kenya Airways, an arrangement that lets the carriers place passengers on each other's flights.\n\nTo spread his vision of a new face for Air France-KLM, Mr de Juniac said he planned to double or triple the advertising budget. The airline has 150 people working on social media networks and will announce a new global advertising campaign and a communication investment strategy this month, he said.\n\n\"Tablets and iPhones impose on us to be present everywhere all the time,\" he said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

In the first bidding exercise for March, Cat A - for cars below 1,600cc and 130 hp - slipped $202 to $76,999.\n\nBut Cat B - for cars above 1,600cc or 130 hp - rose $2,106 to $80,710, while Cat E - the open category - increased $3,000 to $82,000. Cat C and Cat D were also higher, with the former - for goods vehicles - up $3,412 at $56,302, and the latter - for motorcycles - up $500 at $4,001.\n\n\"The vehicle loan restrictions are still affecting demand for both Cat A and B cars,\" said the sales manager of a mid-sized dealership. He reckoned that the only reason for the increase in the Cat B premium was that distributors were trying to clear stock using price cuts and other promotions.\n\n\"The market has been slightly quiet and this has forced them to push for volume,\" he explained. \"So even though people say Cat B is becoming more crowded after the re-categorisation of Cat A, demand is still soft-ish.\"\n\nYesterday's tender was the third for the re-classified Cat A, which saw an additional requirement limiting engine output to no more than 97 kW or 130 hp.\n\nTo back his assertion, the sales manager pointed out that the current Cat B premium is still significantly lower than its recent high six months ago. This, he said, reflected its weakness. Cat B hit $93,500 in October last year.\n\nAs for the Cat A premium, he said that many prospective buyers have been deterred from entering the market because of the more than $5,000 surge in this category two weeks ago. \"The sharp increase in the previous tender has pushed Cat A out of the reach of some buyers.\"\n\nBut another dealer disagreed. He said that the Cat A premium remained \"stable\". He explained: \"It only went down a couple of hundred dollars. To me, that is a minimal adjustment.

And, there's further room over time to enhance our asset taxes. We have to keep all options open.\"\n\nBut this is provided that the system of taxes and transfers stays equitable and the tax burden on the average Singaporean household is kept low, he said, addressing points raised by Members of Parliament in the debate over Budget 2014.\n\nEconomists and tax observers read the Finance Minister's comments as a signal that tax hikes should still be expected, despite their notable absence from this year's budget. Many had expected hikes in wealth taxes or the top income tax rates, to raise revenues for future spending needs.\n\nBarclays economist Leong Wai Ho said: \"The good news is that unlike Korea or Taiwan, the government is not short of revenue in the near term. So it is thinking ahead and can afford to pass these increases on gradually.\"\n\nSingapore's healthy fiscal position now is the result of earlier moves to strengthen revenue streams, such as raising the goods and services tax (GST) in 2007 and introducing the net investment returns contribution (NIRC) framework in 2008, Mr Tharman said. But additional changes may be needed as infrastructural and social needs are projected to push public spending up by as much as 3 per cent of GDP, by 2030. By 2020, expenditures would already have risen by 2 per cent of GDP, he said.\n\nHefty investment will be needed for the expansion of the rail network and Changi Airport, to build new public housing estates and to renew older ones. Education spending will rise too despite falling cohort sizes, as Singapore invests more in each student.\n\nHealthcare spending has also climbed faster than projected. Two years ago, the government said that yearly total healthcare spending would double from $4 billion in 2011 to $8 billion, about 2 per cent of GDP, by 2016. But Singapore's healthcare spending is likely to reach $8 billion by next year - one year earlier than projected - and could rise to $12 billion by 2020, Mr Tharman said.\n\nThe government will have to ensure that all spending is judicious. \"We have to... be obsessed with achieving value for money in every programme,\" Mr Tharman said. Even so, to balance the books, revenues will have to grow at at least the same pace as spending.\n\nBut revenue growth is expected to slow. Cooling asset markets mean less market-based tax revenues and slower foreign workforce growth means foreign worker levy collections will taper off. Noting that Hong Kong is projecting structural deficits in the next 7-10 years, Mr Tharman said that Singapore could run into structural deficits too, if it does not raise revenues in the next decade.\n\nEconomic health is thus the first principle. \"We've got to be a vibrant economy. That's central to our social strategies because an inclusive society is a hollow concept if we don't have fruits to redistribute and share,\" he said.\n\n\"The reality is, we are a small country without a natural hinterland and business does not need to be here . . . We have to remain competitive so that we can attract investments and continue to grow talents. And that involves also retaining our own talents,\" said Mr Tharman, who reiterated during his 90-minute long speech his call for productivity to go beyond incentives to changes in workplace norms and individual behaviour.\n\nThe second principle, Mr Tharman said, is to ensure that the overall system remains fair and equitable, however it changes.\n\nCurrently, Singapore's tax and transfers system ensures that for every dollar of tax the poor pay, they get at least five dollars back in benefits, he said. The top richest 20 per cent of households pay more than half of all taxes collected.\n\nThis means that not every tax has to be progressive for the whole system to be so. \"GST, in its own right is a regressive tax, but when we increased GST, we also made major changes in our other social policies: workfare, household grants, educational subsidies . . . that more than offset the impact of higher GST on the low-income group,\" said Mr Tharman.\n\nThe third principle is to ensure that the tax burden of Singapore's median worker - which is now lower than that of peers in Hong Kong, US and the UK, by the Ministry of Finance's estimates - stays low. \"We have to keep the tax burden of the middle-income low, so that they get to keep as much as they earn,\" Mr Tharman said.\n\nMany think that GST will eventually rise, though DBS economist Irvin Seah says that this will not happen before the next election. \"Of the various forms of taxation, I think taxing property has the least effect on competitiveness,\" he said.\n\nBut Mr Leong says that a property tax hike is unlikely in the near term, given that the market is cooling. \"There might be scope for raising property taxes on larger homes in the future. Betting and gaming taxes can also be tweaked higher,\" he said.\n\nKPMG partner and head of tax Tay Hong Beng said that while traditional options such as raising the corporate tax rate goes against the grain of falling rates in many countries, there are a range of other options. These include luxury taxes, and the option of widening the tax rate bands for top income earners - rather than hiking the rate and discouraging the inflow of high calibre talent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He said of the two months it took to break the story: \"I'd been hearing rumours about the possibility of loan curbs, but it was hard to pin down specific details.\"\n\nHe added that support from his editor and a break from a long-time contact got him the story, which he found challenging to do because of the \"numerous dead-ends\".\n\n\"All journalists know what it's like to chase a tough story and the satisfaction you get when you finally break it,\" he said.\n\nMs Soh, 27, who said that winning the Young Journalist title took her by surprise, felt \"very privileged to be in a newsroom where editors are very supportive and colleagues are both smart and helpful\".\n\nShe found her niche in commodities through an overseas reporting trip to India during her degree programme at Nanyang Technological University; it was at the time of the global food crisis of 2008, and she covered India's agricultural sector.\n\nHer two-year stint at International Enterprise Singapore broadened her understanding of the global agri-commodities industry. \"It piqued my interest in the corporate and financial underpinnings of the sector, subsequently leading me to join BT,\" she said.\n\nShe has been with the paper for one-and-a-half years and enjoys her job.\n\n\"There's no other job that opens doors for one to meet people from all backgrounds, to listen to their point of view, and to learn new things every day,\" said the correspondent, who also played a key role in a project to improve work processes in the newsroom.\n\nMr Chung, recognised for his layout and design for BT's Luxe Christmas 2013 magazine, said that he redesigned the magazine and logo to give it a \"fresher and more current look and feel\". \"I also wanted a design that would epitomise luxury - an idea that the magazine's stories conveyed,\" he said.\n\nOther winners who were honoured at yesterday's awards included Joyce Lim of The Straits Times who was named Journalist of the Year for her body of work. ST senior correspondent Radha Basu won Feature of the Year for her special report about Singapore's caregivers in The Sunday Times. ST's Rachel Chang took the Commentary of the Year award for her piece, \"Weaning S'pore off the Great Man leadership style\".\n\nJonathan Choo of The New Paper won the News Picture of the Year award for his dramatic shot of the chaos at the Little India riot, while Ashleigh Sim of ST took the Feature Picture of the Year prize for the feature headlined \"Daughter & Caregiver\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/yuan-correction-not-raising-hedging-alarm", "site_title": "Yuan correction not raising hedging alarm", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nYuan correction not raising hedging alarm\n\nBanks say most corporate clients using simple hedging instruments\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Mar 4, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] The recent slide in the yuan against the US dollar could offer some pause to investors in yuan-based structured products, a growing, billion-dollar market that has been fuelled by single-minded bets on yuan appreciation in the long term.\n\nBut this price correction has not pushed concerns of large hedging losses to the fore yet. There is little evidence that corporate clients are speculating, and most of them are using straightforward hedging instruments, banks told The Business Times.\n\nWhat has been noted is the hive of activity in the market for structured FX products - estimated at US$150 billion in outstanding volume - that effectively places bets on yuan appreciation, said Adam Gilmour, head of corporate sales and structuring in Asia Pacific, Citi Global Markets.\n\n\"The market is definitely on this trade. It's been the most obvious trade to do, to benefit from China's strength,\" he said.\n\n\"There was too much of an obvious bet. It was getting to the point where it was becoming a little systematically dangerous\" he added, referring to the general one-direction view of the market.\n\nCiti has had to put up restrictions on customers wanting to invest in more than the bank was comfortable with. For such trades, clients would have to put up collateral, and losses are deducted against their margin account.\n\n\"They were pretty annoyed with us up until three weeks ago, but I don't think they are annoyed with us now,\" said Mr Gilmour, who is not seeing big defaults, given the buffer from collateral payment.\n\nThis discipline has also filtered into hedging products that the bank offers to corporate clients, with Mr Gilmour drawing a parallel to the pre-crisis period, when exporters, particularly in Korea, were hedging out \"as long in the future as they could\" on the bet that the US dollar would continue weakening.\n\n\"The renminbi was getting a bit like that. What's good for customers is a lot of banks learnt their lessons from the financial crisis. We don't let customers deal in much more than one year,\" he said. \"So even though there's a massive position in the market, we don't think customers are generally overhedged.\"\n\nStill, market participants have stepped back a bit. Citi has not seen a lot of activity in the last two days from dollar sellers, and this could mean that investors are waiting for the dollar to strike higher before going in, said Mr Gilmour.\n\nDespite the fall in the yuan against the dollar, Citi has not seen market participants unwinding positions, he added. \"We're not at levels that I think are dangerous yet.\"\n\nThe slide in the yuan - reportedly a product of intervention by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) - began in the middle of February. At around 7pm yesterday, one US dollar was equivalent to 6.1425 yuan in the spot market. By comparison, at the end of last year, one US dollar translated to just 6.0541 yuan.\n\n\"For us, what we're seeing is a correction,\" said Lee Beng-Hong, Deutsche Bank's head of markets in China. \"Given the strong trade numbers, and the strong interest from different investors to access the China market, there will still be some appreciation bias.\"\n\nThis correction offers an opportune entry point for corporate clients with cash-flow hedging requirements, said Mr Lee, who is based in Singapore.\n\nMost clients are also using simple hedging instruments, he added. \"From a volume perspective, a lot of the hedging that we've seen to date has been very vanilla - usually just simple forward positions.\"\n\nAnalysts have noted that the move to ease the controlled currency against the US dollar is meant to weed out some speculators.\n\nThis intervention is also a paradox in that the government is pushing for the yuan as a two-way trade, so that it can widen the trading band - a move that would herald a more market-oriented system, the PBOC indicated last year.\n\nThe trading band is currently at one per cent from the set rate in daily trading, and there is expectation in the market for the band to be widened to 2 per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/china-central-bank-indicates-two-way-fluctuation-yuan", "site_title": "China central bank indicates two-way fluctuation for yuan", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nChina central bank indicates two-way fluctuation for yuan\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Mar 4, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nCHINA has succeeded in making its currency a two-way bet, having guided it downwards for much of last month to reverse its upward march. Now, it appears China is not willing to let a depreciated yuan become an entrenched market perception.\n\nOn Monday, the People's Bank of China for the first time commented on the yuan, also known as renminbi (RMB). Yi Gang, a vice-governor at the central bank who heads the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, spoke to Chinese media briefly on the sidelines of the opening of the annual parliamentary session, cautioning against over-interpretation of the currency's movements.\n\n\"China's economic fundamentals are stable and healthy, its balance of payment reaching an equilibrium. Therefore, two-way fluctuation would all be possible. From now on, the flexibility of RMB exchange rate will be enhanced, moving steadily toward a convertible capital account,\" he was quoted as saying.\n\nOn the same day, the Chinese central bank, in a reversal of policy shift, set the yuan's parity rate higher, at 6.119 to the dollar, after already hiking the rate last Friday, at 6.1214, ten basic points higher than Thursday's parity of 6.1224.\n\nBy aiming for a stronger yuan, the Chinese central bank has signalled the limits to which it would tolerate yuan's weakness, so that it won't overdo it as to trigger a capital flight or raise the overseas borrowing costs sharply for the Chinese corporates, including on the dollar loans taken by the real estate companies.\n\nThe parity is the closest thing to a policy pronouncement from the Chinese central bank. Each day, it publishes the rate only once in the morning in the form of an official parity rate for the yuan to trade against major currencies through China Foreign Exchange Trade System. The rate serves as the midpoint within a tightly controlled trading band of one per cent.\n\nStill, contrary to the official wishes to prop up the yuan, it closed at 6.1435 yesterday.\n\nThe yuan's depreciation on Friday was especially remarkable, setting it up as the largest single-day loss - down 0.41 per cent and the largest monthly loss of 2.03 per cent - since Feb 10, all after China floated the currency in 2005 in an exchange rate reform. Since 2005, yuan has gained more than 30 per cent against the dollar.\n\nMany forces could be at work to push down the yuan just as the government was changing course to guide it upwards, including China's worsening macro picture, the US tapering, China's troubled trust funds, and doubts over the viability of the Chinese banking sector.\n\nThese forces were \"amplified\" by forced liquidation of highly leveraged products traded in Hong Kong and linked to the offshore trading of the yuan, so-called CNH, to the tune of \"over US$500 billion yuan\", according to Haitong International Securities in a note issued on Monday.\n\nAdding to that is billions of dollars tied up in the RMB-yen carry trade, which capitulated once yuan shifted gear towards depreciation, Haitong adds. This carry trade has made about 4 per cent annualised gains, including 3 per cent on interest spread and one per cent on yuan's appreciation with the borrowing of low-cost yen, at no more than 0.25 per cent.\n\nGoldman Sachs detects two policy signals behind yuan's recent depreciation. First, the currency is likely to be deemed at or close to its fair value by the government, and possibly by an increasing number of market participants. Citing one IMF-based, trade-weighted calculation, Goldman Sachs says yuan is now within the range of its \"fair value\".\n\nSecond is a possible change in the government's perspective against yuan further strengthening with limited downside risks amid a surge in capital inflows. Goldman Sachs estimates around half of the total FX reserve accumulation last year came not from traditional channel of foreign direct investment.\n\nUsing the yuan's recent depreciation as a policy tool to keep speculative inflows at bay is a prevailing view endorsed by most analysts, including those at HSBC and the wealth and asset management team at Deutsche Bank.\n\n\"We maintain the RMB's weakness is not a policy move to help support growth, but believe there is still a policy willingness to curb speculative inflows before introducing FX reform,\" HSBC says in a note issued on Friday, citing strong intervention by the Chinese central bank to contain the yuan's appreciation early this year, a trend extended from its purchase last year of near US$500 billion to curb the yuan's advance against the dollar.\n\nDeutsche's team goes further to identify US$25.4 billion in foreign exchange forward contracts, deemed \"speculative\" by China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange, in the US$73.3 billion increase of China's official reserve in January; and increased carry-related flows in the last few months resulting in elevated high levels of the Chinese money and bond market rates.\n\nThe team also discerns \"strong indications\" of speculative capital flowing through trade routes, judging from last two months' trade data and a 10 per cent increase in the trading volume between yuan and Hong Kong dollar, in the last two working days of last week, also indicative of speculative capital being the main driver.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Now, as long as a company sets up a business in the Shanghai free trade zone, it can borrow CNH from any of the offshore-yuan markets - mainly Hong Kong, Singapore, London and Taiwan - and use that as payment in the zone.\n\nThis eases previous concerns from corporate clients who have been mulling the use of invoices in yuan. If the offshore yuan market is volatile, the worry was that a trading firm would not get the currency at the same rate as its onshore subsidiary, which would have access to the onshore yuan market, said Lee Beng-Hong, Deutsche Bank's head of markets in China.

This is just over the total $2.2 billion budget for economic development in 2014.\n\nFor Mr Lien's math to work out, the government will also need to reduce special transfers by about half, or about $5.5 billion, to 1.7 per cent of GDP, based on 2014 estimates. Special transfers comprise one-off direct transfers to businesses and households and top-ups to endowment and trust funds created by the government.\n\nCutting $5.5 billion from special transfers would be the equivalent of doing away with about 11/2 times the $3.6 billion budgeted in 2014 for non-endowment and trust fund special transfers, such as the GST voucher special payment, CPF Medisave top-ups and the Productivity and Innovations Credit scheme.\n\nMr Lien told The Business Times that the cut to special transfers may not be as drastic in future Budgets, partly because in 2014, special transfers was 3.1 per cent of GDP, higher than the 2.5 per cent average since 2008.\n\nHe also advocated doing away with endowment fund top-ups, arguing that the endowment system was an inherently inefficient use of revenue. An endowment that has a spending cap of 4 per cent, for example, would require $100 of outlay just to put $4 to work. Better to pay that $4 directly, he argued.\n\nPaying directly would put such programmes as the GST Voucher Fund and the National Youth Fund under operating budget, which is funded every year as running costs. But Mr Lien reckoned that doing so would be perfectly fine.\n\n\"If an endowment is created, then it is for a very long-term programme which should last into perpetuity. One can also argue that a long-term programme with recurrent expenditure should be in the main budget,\" he said.\n\nMr Lien also asked Parliament to consider offering free education for every child aged three to 18.\n\nWhat would that entail? The Ministry of Education said there were about 450,000 primary to pre-university students enrolled here in 2012, excluding those in the mixed-level programmes offered in through-train schools.\n\nThose students would have paid about $101 million in basic school fees over a year, assuming they were charged the maximum-allowed miscellaneous fees, but excluding additional fees that can be levied by special programmes and independent schools.\n\nFully subsidising those fees would have cost less than one per cent of the $11.5 billion education Budget for 2014, and less than 0.1 per cent of the total expenditure Budget for the year.\n\nLikely to be more expensive per child is fully subsidising pre-school care for those aged three to six, a fact Mr Lien acknowledged.\n\nHe said: \"The main new expenditure is kindergarten, but we are already starting to do quite a lot here.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Investors might be better served looking at less risky alternatives within the sector.\n\nSwee Hong shares made their listing debut on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) mainboard in May 2012 and had traded between 25 and 32 cents for most of that time. But the Oct 4 collapse last year of a handful of SGX stocks - Asiasons Capital, Blumont Group, LionGold Corp, Innopac Holdings, ISR Capital and ISDN Holdings - triggered a massive selloff among smaller counters that hit Swee Hong as well.\n\nBetween Oct 4 and Oct 30, Swee Hong stock tumbled from 29 cents to 12.8 cents, losing more than half its value. The shares hovered between 11 and 12 cents for the bulk of the next four months.\n\nOn Monday last week, Swee Hong stock suddenly shot up 36 per cent, from 12.9 cents to 17.6 cents, drawing a trading query from SGX. Swee Hong gave a boilerplate reply saying that it did not know of any undisclosed information that might explain the trading. But the rally continued, pushing the stock to 25 cents by Thursday. The stock's 94.2 per cent gain in February was the largest among Singapore-listed stocks.\n\nSwee Hong shares closed at 26 cents yesterday.\n\nWhat could explain the rally?\n\nThe easy argument that Swee Hong is simply returning to its pre-Oct 4 pricing level is not entirely convincing.\n\nTo begin with, there is no apparent catalyst for the February rally in the stock.\n\nSince Oct 4, Swee Hong has not announced any new contracts, save for the setting up of a joint venture with six other parties to tender for and undertake MRT projects. That partnership, in which Swee Hong has a one-fifth stake, has yet to bear tangible fruit.\n\nIn the meantime, Swee Hong has also posted two quarters of losses. As at its fiscal half-time ended Dec 31, 2013, six-month net loss was $9.7 million, wider than its year-ago loss of $680,000.\n\nSwee Hong did have an order book of about $168.1 million as at Feb 14 this year, but the bulk of it is not expected to contribute significantly to revenue until fiscal 2015. And none of it was announced between October and February.\n\nEven if Swee Hong's share price was merely reverting to \"normal\" valuations, it is not clear that those valuations are particularly attractive.\n\nIn terms of earnings multiples, loss-making and non-dividend paying Swee Hong is clearly more richly valued than its rivals.

Unlike a hospital, individual providers in a private medical complex are not required to provide charity care, nor do these complexes have non-profit missions to serve a community's health needs, although some tenants are non-profits.\n\nNevertheless, these buildings are often ideal for medical uses - an emergency department can be repurposed as an urgent care centre. Existing operating rooms can be used for outpatient surgical centres. And an inpatient floor is a natural fit for a sub-acute care facility. Added to that, the new use is certainly preferable to a deteriorating structure that contributes to urban decay.\n\nPull into the parking lot of Barnert Medical Arts Complex on a congested street in Paterson, and it might be mistaken for the hospital that closed in 2008. Red signs direct visitors to an urgent care centre that occupies the same space that the emergency department once used. The building also houses three surgical centres, a Planned Parenthood facility and Turning Point, the drug rehabilitation facility where Dennis Rodman stayed in January.\n\n\"This was a facility that essentially was empty - the community suffered,\" said State Senator Bob Gordon, who recently reintroduced legislation to provide developers with a tax credit if they repurpose closed hospitals for other medical uses. The developer \"was able to transform this facility into one that better matched the needs of the community.\"\n\nThe developer, Community Healthcare Associates of Bloomfield, New Jersey, bought the building in bankruptcy court in 2008. After a US$25 million renovation, the facility now also offers a sleep centre, a breast care centre and a 54-bed sub-acute care facility that has crown moulding, dark wood floors and plush waiting room furniture. An adult medical day care facility occupies the sixth floor of the building, which was once the maternity ward.\n\nSix years after the developer acquired the 300,000-square-foot property, it is more than 95 per cent occupied, employs about 700 people and pays about US$600,000 in property taxes, although the company is contesting the assessment with the city. In the next few weeks a dialysis centre will open on the ground floor.\n\n\"We provide almost every service that this hospital used to provide,\" said Stephen Kirby, a managing partner at Community Healthcare Associates. \"So there is still a healthcare presence here.\"\n\nThese medical malls do offer healthcare services, but not necessarily the same ones the hospital provided. An urgent care centre, for example, is not an emergency room that can admit patients.\n\nWhile a non-profit hospital is required to serve a community's health needs, a developer's primary goal is to fill space with tenants who can pay the rent. So a primary care doctor or a paediatrician might not be as lucrative a tenant as a radiologist. Barnert, for example, does not have a paediatrician on its roster, while it does have an oncologist, a cardiologist and a psychiatrist.\n\n\"The mix of services is radically different\" at a medical mall, said Alan Sager, a professor of health policy and management at Boston University School of Public Health. \"The services added might be more profitable, and if they're not profitable, they are probably going to close.\"\n\nBarnert developers did, however, actively seek women's healthcare providers, including Planned Parenthood and a breast centre, to replace some services lost when the hospital closed.\n\nLast summer, Global Life Enterprises purchased the shuttered Mercer Hospital in Trenton, which closed in 2011 to make way for a US$540 million state-of-the-art facility in suburban Hopewell, New Jersey.\n\nSoon, the 650,000-square-foot campus, which dates back to the 19th century, will re-emerge as a health and wellness centre, with plans for a hotel-like lobby, a waterfall, an adult medical day care facility, a spa and possibly a yoga centre. The complex already has a few tenants, including a smoking-cessation centre, a child advocacy group and doctor's offices.\n\n\"I am trying to put in services that would complement each other,\" said Priti Pandya-Patel, founder of Global Life Enterprises, who also owns several sleep centres around the state. \"What we're looking to do is to make it into a one-stop healthcare mall.\"\n\nNew Jersey hospitals have been struggling for decades; eight filed for bankruptcy in the last seven years.\n\nAll New Jersey hospitals are required to provide charity care, a requirement that can be financially challenging for urban hospitals, which have a larger mix of uninsured patients. Added to that, Americans spend less time in hospitals than they did a generation ago, as more procedures are performed on an outpatient basis. And insurers are often more stringent in coverage of in-hospital care for many illnesses.\n\nA medical mall escapes many of the challenges the hospitals face: Its tenants can turn away uninsured patients, and it does not need to staff a hospital with nurses and on-call specialists available at a moment's notice.\n\n\"Our model is allowing for the migration of healthcare from inpatient to outpatient care,\" said William Colgan, a managing partner at Community Healthcare Associates. \"Here there are no inefficiencies. You don't have to have an operating room staffed with nurses and doctors if no patients are here.\"\n\nBut for communities with a high mix of uninsured patients, the services available at a medical mall are inaccessible to a sizable portion of the population. So the remaining hospitals absorb more uninsured patients, while they lose paying patients to a medical mall.\n\n\"You make it increasingly hard for the safety-net hospitals that remain to survive,\" said David Knowlton, president of the New Jersey Health Care Quality Institute. \"You could start a downward spiral.\"\n\nAs the federal healthcare law takes hold, however, 444,000 New Jersey residents are expected to join the ranks of the insured and another 250,000 non-elderly residents will be eligible for Medicaid, according to a report by the Rutgers Center for State Health Policy. Many of these new Medicaid recipients will be heavily concentrated in poorer communities such as Paterson and Trenton, according to Joel Cantor, who co-wrote the report.\n\nStill, even with expanded coverage, independent providers in these medical complexes are much more likely to offer services that are out of network, which generally translates to much higher out-of-pocket costs for patients, Mr Knowlton said.\n\nCommunity Healthcare Associations has been expanding on its model. In 2012, the company bought Greenville Hospital in Jersey City for US$1 million. Last summer, it bought Kessler Memorial Hospital in Hammonton for US$2.5 million. Both facilities are being renovated - Greenville Hospital has been stripped down to the studs - and will reopen as medical malls in 2014 and 2015. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

That's because the Fed is looking at a mosaic of economic data to determine whether to turn the taper dial up or down, or hold it steady. And winter weather, particularly in the north-east, has given policymakers a foggy lens through which to examine the pace of the recovery.\n\nThe stock whisperer\n\nThe difference maker for the stock market? Janet Yellen. Last week saw stocks post gains as investors seemed to be reassured by Ms Yellen's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee and shrugged off the revised fourth quarter gross domestic product report, which showed a significant - but expected - reduction in growth for the quarter. Both events help put this Friday's jobs report in perspective.\n\nIn her testimony to Congress, Ms Yellen stressed the importance of continuing the same policies the Fed had in place under Ben Bernanke. She also explained that the US Fed doesn't yet know how large a role weather played in the weak economic data we've seen recently. Additionally, she said that the Federal Open Market Committee is not on a pre-set course when it comes to tapering, and that it has the flexibility to adjust the unwinding of its asset purchases based on the pace of the recovery. While the hurdle for making such adjustments is very high, her comments left room for the US Fed to slow tapering if weakness persists or worsens, which gave comfort to investors.\n\nWhen it comes to market stability, communication from central bankers is key. US investors, unlike UK investors, still trust their central bank's forward guidance on its target interest rate, which is why short-term rates remain well anchored. Americans seem to recognise that tapering does not equal tightening.\n\nThe big negative\n\nFor their part, US investors cheered Ms Yellen's comments, which made it easier for them to swallow the downward GDP revision. While expected, the revision was substantial and stemmed somewhat from all the delayed and incomplete data caused by the government shutdown. Unfortunately, the big negative change came from consumer spending, which dropped significantly. This should not come as a surprise given that consumer sentiment dropped substantially in the fourth quarter, driven by the drama in Washington. Exports fell too, which could be a concern going forward given the strengthening of the US dollar. However, there was good news in the report too: an increase in capital expenditures. Yes, companies finally started loosening their purse strings and spending some of the historically high levels of cash they've hoarded in this post-crisis environment.\n\nSuch a solid increase in capex is at least partially a result of a rush to take advantage of the tax breaks businesses were getting on new equipment purchases, which expired at the end of 2013. Still, January's core capital goods orders rose 1.7 per cent, which suggests the improvement in capital spending could have staying power.\n\nThe snowpocalyptic weather\n\nLooking ahead to Friday's report, it's still unclear how big a role weather will play. However, we can assume that the \"snowpocalyptic\" weather will have some negative impact on job growth. But we may see the unemployment rate either remain flat, or even fall, because emergency unemployment insurance expired at the end of 2013. Just as unemployment insurance extensions boosted the jobless rate in the past few years, as the Atlanta Fed pointed out in a recent report, expirations are likely driving down the unemployment rate, a trend that will probably continue. Most importantly, a disappointing jobs report raises a lot of questions about consumer sentiment. While consumer sentiment has bounced back since the dark days of October, consumer psyches remain somewhat fragile. Indeed, further labour market weakness or escalating tensions in the Ukraine could short-circuit the recent surge.\n\nThe bottom line: The February jobs report may not be as helpful in gauging the pace of the labour-market recovery because bad weather and the expiration of unemployment insurance could be colouring the data. But while the February jobs report on its own may not be particularly meaningful, the overall job situation is critical because of its impact on consumer moods. It's also not likely to factor too heavily into US Fed policy. While Ms Yellen comforted investors by suggesting that the US Fed will continue to offer a safety net in case of an emergency, it will likely take a lot of bad news for the US Fed to alter the course of tapering.\n\nThe writer is head of US capital markets research & strategy at Allianz Global Investors\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom: survey\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

The legal changes have a \"limited chance\" of getting through the Senate, Qantas said in response.\n\nThe airline known as the Flying Kangaroo last week announced 5,000 job cuts, the delay or sale of 50 aircraft, and a companywide pay freeze after a market share battle with Virgin Australia Holdings drove it to a A$235 million (S$266.7 million) net loss. Chief executive officer Alan Joyce has been lobbying the government since November to \"level the playing field\", accusing Virgin of using foreign government cash to undermine formerly state-owned Qantas.\n\n\"The market is losing confidence\" in Mr Joyce's leadership, Evan Lucas, a market strategist at IG Ltd, said yesterday. \"If the shareholders lose confidence in you, you're in trouble and your time is numbered.\"\n\nQantas' public campaign since November, highlighting the urgent need for government assistance, hasn't been positive for the company's shares, Simon Robinson, a senior wealth manager at Shaw Stockbroking Ltd, said from Brisbane.\n\n\"You have to ask whether buying shares in Qantas is a risk worth taking, given the views that are coming out of the company on a daily basis,\" he said. \"Airlines are notoriously problematic anyway.\"\n\nQantas, which made 18 consecutive annual profits up to 2011, has lost its investment-grade credit ratings since forecasting the first-half loss in December.\n\nThe airline faces \"significant operational challenges as a result of the heavy competition, both domestically and in its principal offshore markets,\" Moody's Investors Service senior vice-president Ian Lewis wrote in a credit opinion on Feb 27.\n\nThe carrier had sought a facility that would reduce its borrowing costs, Transport Minister Warren Truss was cited as saying last month in the Australian Financial Review newspaper. That won't now be forthcoming, Mr Abbott said on Monday.\n\n\"I think what Qantas would like most of all is for the government to play favourites,\" Mr Abbott said on Monday. \"Well, that's not how this government operates.\"\n\nThe government will instead seek to repeal part of the Qantas Sale Act. That would allow it to split its international and domestic units to comply with other legislation that requires Australian-based international airlines to have majority local ownership, Mr Abbott said.\n\nVirgin in 2012 carried out the same split and Qantas has said that it's studying whether to have separate licences for its domestic and international units.\n\n\"Qantas can jump up and down and turn blue, but it cannot expect the government to do more than it has done,\" Grahame Morris, federal director of lobbyists Barton Deakin, said on Monday. \"I don't think that Qantas has ever proved in this debate that it has cleaned up its own house.\"\n\nThe proposed law change was criticised by Shadow Transport Minister Anthony Albanese on Monday.\n\n\"It's not an Australian airline if its head office is not in Australia, if its board is not in Australia, if its maintenance activity is not in Australia, if the majority of its ownership is not in Australia,\" Mr Albanese said.\n\nParts of the legislation, including limits restricting a single foreign company to 25 per cent of Qantas shares and total foreign airline holdings to 35 per cent, may be up for discussion, Mr Albanese said.\n\n\"We have consistently said that removal of foreign ownership provisions that apply uniquely to Qantas is an important longer-term objective to create a fair and free aviation market in Australia,\" Qantas said in a statement. \"However, it's clear that such a move would have limited chance of passing through the senate.\"\n\nThe government lacks a majority in the upper house.- Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

Chinese trading firm Unipec is already one of the world's biggest crude oil buyers.\n\nState-backed Cofco, which last week agreed to buy a 51 per cent stake in Dutch grain trader Nidera, is conducting due diligence on the Noble unit, said the sources who declined to be identified because the matter is not yet public.\n\nThe precise stage of the talks was not clear, they said, cautioning that a deal may or may not materialise for the unit which trades and processes grains.\n\nNoble shares jumped as much as 8.6 per cent to S$1.075, the highest since Jan 2 after the Reuters story, adding around US$450 million in market value. They closed S$1.04 yesterday.\n\nAn acquisition push by state-run Cofco comes after a wave of consolidation in the global agri-business sector - including deals by Japanese firms to snap up rivals - that has largely passed China by.\n\nThe Nidera acquisition is Cofco's first major overseas purchase of a trading house and signals China's ambition to create a global trading company along the lines of Japanese, European and US trading giants.\n\nLast year, Japanese trading house Marubeni Corp agreed to pay US$5.6 billion for US grain merchant Gavilon while Glencore bought Viterra, Canada's largest grain handler, for US$6 billion in 2012.\n\n\"Noble has been trying to sell their agri-business for a while but we are not sure what Cofco will gain out of it,\" said an industry analyst in Australia. \"The consolidation in the industry has already taken place and it seems they are trying to get hold of what is available.\"\n\nNoble, which is 14 per cent-owned by sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp, trades sugar, coffee and raw materials such as iron ore. Its agricultural division is the smallest and generated US$15.5 billion revenue last fiscal year, accounting for about 16 per cent of the total.\n\nNoble's net profit tumbled 48 per cent last fiscal year after its agricultural business swung to an operating loss. But the performance of the unit has improved over the last year.\n\nIn 2011, the Hong Kong-based trading house considered listing its agri-business which could have raised US$700 million, sources said at the time, but the plan was shelved.\n\nChina is looking for new sources of supplies to ensure food security and meet a growing demand for high-protein products fuelled by rising incomes.\n\nAsked about its mergers and acquisition intentions previously, Cofco has said that a key strategy is to increase supply sources worldwide to boost food security and also focus on firms that have the network to help export finished and processed food products.\n\nIn a late afternoon announcement yesterday, Noble said that it was in discussions with a consortium on a potential joint venture on its agriculture business. No binding arrangements have as yet been entered into, it said. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nMalaysia has not found any evidence yet of illicit chip smuggling, minister says\n\nJul 15, 2025 01:43 PM\n\nNvidia to resume H20 AI chip sales to China in US reversal\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nIndonesia looking at levy on coal exports to boost state coffers\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:03 PM\n\nAsia: Markets mixed as China\u2019s economy meets forecasts\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:49 AM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM", "images": []}

This is not quite the East Asia that Mr Obama will be coming to when he embarks upon his visit to Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines at the end of April. Not since the Vietnam War has East Asia loomed so large in terms of an apparent threat to regional security as it does now, with Japan and China confronting each other over territorial claims to the point of possible clashes and with Japan-South Korea relations strained to breaking point.\n\nMr Obama's visit is intended to make up for one he cancelled last year because of the government shutdown in Washington. Now, the focus of a trip originally intended to be exclusively on South-east Asia will inevitably shift towards the Northeast where potential frictions over territorial and other issues are strong, especially since China announced its East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone.\n\nMr Obama faces the unenviable task of steering the US ship of state through or around these dangerous shoals while avoiding the impression that Washington is seeking to take sides. Yet, by the very act of pivoting - a term that has strong military connotations - the United States implied that it was going to be stepping up its strategic, \"peace-keeping\" role in East Asia as well as reinforcing its economic presence in the region.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nAnother moon landing will take more than rocket science\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nSingapore\u2019s new grant signals the need to adapt to tariffs, not just ride them out\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nEroding US exceptionalism will impact world economy\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nBye-bye America First?\n\nJul 15, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

But by 2006, the company announced its exit after the expected growth in the market did not materialise.\n\nRecent surveys by Airbus and Honeywell, however, suggest that the market might now be ready as passengers increasingly expect airlines to have inflight wireless services. Airbus published a report in February about the comfort demands of Asian passengers, carried out by global consultancy Future Laboratory.\n\nOne of the future trends highlighted was that Asian business passengers would expect Wi-Fi enabled cabins with telephone and conference calling facilities.\n\nHoneywell also conducted a survey of 3,000 passengers from the US, Britain and Singapore and nearly 90 per cent would give up an amenity for a faster and more consistent wireless connection.\n\nWhen flying over land, planes use telecommunication towers to transmit Internet signals but during long-haul flights, when they fly over large expanses of water, consistent connectivity becomes a problem. In those cases, a satellite network is needed.\n\nIn December last year, Inmarsat launched the first of three satellites that will serve the GX network. Air China will be the first airline to test it, on its A330 fleet in the second quarter of next year.\n\nSingapore Airlines, which launched its US$50 million inflight connectivity programme in September 2012, said that it planned to finish equipping its aircraft with the hardware by next year.\n\nA Lufthansa spokesman said that it would also begin rolling out inflight Wi-Fi on all of its planes in the middle of this year.\n\nEven no-frills airlines are catching on. Thai budget airline Nok Air announced during the Singapore Airshow that it will equip its new Boeing 737 fleet with Wi-Fi.\n\nPeter Andersson, general manager of aviation navigation company Jeppesen, also said that the technology could benefit cockpit and airport operation.\n\n\"If you have something that you need to repair, you can get the status check to the ground level so they can be prepared so they can actually do the maintenance quicker,\" he said. \"You can reduce the turnaround and maintenance (of airplanes) dramatically.\" - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

The homebuilder targets 50 billion yen of revenue in the US by the year ending March 2019, it said.\n\nJapan's shrinking population has prompted the country's homebuilders such as Daiwa House to seek new revenue sources. Texas is the most that Daiwa House is investing overseas for rental housing and compares with the 50 billion yen that the company had announced for investments abroad in its mid-term plan in November.\n\n\"The investment amount is very aggressive and it seems risky,\" said Masahiro Mochizuki, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG via telephone.\n\nDaiwa House plans to invest in Texas because of its rising population and it will target \"Generation Y\", those born between 1975 and 1989, an age group seen to support demand in the leasing market, the company said.\n\nThe investment plan revealed in November for overseas investments was \"just a tentative estimate\", Eiji Matsuda, a spokesman at Daiwa House, said yesterday.\n\nDaiwa House plans to boost its rental housing revenue by 35 per cent to 800 billion yen by the year ending March 2015, the company had said in November. The rental housing business, the biggest contributer to the homebuilder's revenue, is almost double that from the home construction division, it said. The developer raised as much as 137.9 billion yen from a share sale in July.\n\n\"Daiwa House has plenty of cash,\" said Yoji Otani, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in Tokyo. \"The management doesn't think Japan has much growth prospect so they are investing overseas. The healthy balance sheet that Daiwa has enables them to take on such risk.\"\n\nShares of Daiwa House gained 0.4 per cent to 1,853 yen at the close of trading in Tokyo.

But others reckon that the accumulation is likely to be the result of seasonal weakness and bad weather conditions in the US.\n\nFebruary's PMI reading stood at 50.9. This followed a January reading of 50.5, and surpassed market economists' consensus forecast of 50.3. While the electronics sector continued to expand for the 13th consecutive month, the electronics PMI slipped to 51.2 in February, down from 52 in January.\n\nA reading above 50 denotes growth, while one under 50 points to a contraction.\n\nAccording to the Singapore Institute of Purchasing & Materials Management (SIPMM), which compiles the monthly barometre of industrial activity, the improvement in overall PMI has been attributed to expansion in new orders and new export orders, as well as production output and inventory.\n\nThe inventory sub-index posted a reading of 52.9, the highest since December 2011, while the index for stocks of finished goods rose beyond the 50-point threshold to 50.8.\n\nNoting that stocks of finished goods are \"historically usually at negative levels\", DBS economist Irvin Seah said: \"Suddenly, manufacturers are seeing inventory building up, and finding themselves stocking up finished products. This suggests that production levels are soon going to taper off, even if (they are) currently quite strong.\"\n\nAdded CIMB economist Song Seng Wun: \"I will be watching (the inventory index), because it can go either way. Higher inventories could be a sign of demand slacking, but it could also be businesses in anticipation of demand recovery.\"\n\nIndeed, SIPMM executive director Janice Ong said that there is \"anecdotal evidence\" that electronics manufacturers are expecting a surge in order demand in coming months.\n\nBut Barclays and UOB economists have another take, citing frigid weather conditions in the US, which have likely suppressed export orders.\n\nSaid Barclays economist Leong Wai Ho: \"The snowstorm in the US is masking the underlying improvement at the moment. Which is probably why finished goods are stacking up in factories in North Asia and Singapore because of unprecedented disruptions to air freight to US destinations in January, and probably in February and March as well - due to airport closures and unwillingness to ship.\"\n\nUOB's Francis Tan also pointed out that the US PMI new orders sub-index fell from 64.4 in December to 51.2 in January. \"Given that they're one of our biggest trading partners, it's not really a surprise that new export orders - while still above the 50-point mark - are down for both overall and electronics PMI,\" said Mr Tan.\n\nBarclays's Mr Leong expects positive payback in exports to the US in Q2, and says that \"this means purchasing activity across Asia should pick up in March and April\".\n\nBut Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Chua Hak Bin has his reservations. \"We've been a bit disenchanted with PMI readings over the last year, since (they have) not been synchronised with actual export figures . . . I think generally, there's a worry that December's surge in exports across Asia has not followed through in the early part of this year, so I'll be waiting for February and March manufacturing and trade numbers to come in.\"\n\nTogether with economists from CIMB and UOB, DBS' Mr Seah believes that the overall manufacturing sector will stay in expansion mode, but at a slower pace of growth.\n\nAt the same time, at least three economists flagged the unfolding instability in Ukraine as a key risk to watch out for.\n\nSaid OCBC's Selena Ling: \"Looking forward, the manufacturing recovery theme remains intact, predicated also on the global recovery theme, but could be more modest in its trajectory given the emerging geopolitical headwinds and challenges facing China due to its ongoing economic reform agenda.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The bad news: Winning that golden statue is just not the same as it used to be.\n\nThe box-office bump that traditionally rewarded winners of the Academy Awards' Best Picture prize has not been as assured over the past 10 years as it used to be, and the size of the boost has been shrinking, according to a BT analysis.\n\nGoing back 30 years, winners of the top Oscar have mostly enjoyed a bounce in box-office takings immediately after the awards. US per-day receipts rose 73 per cent on average for Best Picture winners in the two weekends after taking the award, compared to the two weekends prior.\n\nBut the bulk of the gains came before the turn of the century. Before 2002, all but two Best Picture winners saw post-award domestic takings increase. But beginning with A Beautiful Mind in 2002, five of the last 12 winners, excluding Monday's 12 Years A Slave, have experienced box-office slumps immediately after the awards.\n\nThe magnitude of the post-award jump has also diminished since 2001. Taking the median impact for every five-year block since 1984, the post-award two-weekend bump for Best Picture films has fallen from 71.9 per cent between 1984 and 1988 to 13.3 per cent between 2009 and 2013.\n\nPart of that decline is due to changing viewing habits. The rise of DVDs and online services such as Netflix now offer alternatives to movie theatres for audiences, meaning that some of the increased viewership that come after an award will not be box office receipts.\n\nCNN has estimated that Oscar campaigning could cost north of US$1 million in some cases, which can be justified if you can pick up almost US$700,000 more in theatre revenues in just two weeks with an award, as Slumdog Millionaire did in 2009. The box office is still a major factor for films, said filmmaker Tan Fong Cheng of Singapore's homegrown Zhao Wei Films, which has a number of award-winning films in its stable.\n\n\"Box office receipts are still the main source of revenue for films,\" she said, noting that winning awards definitely helps a film in terms of the box office. \"It helps to raise awareness and visibility of the film.\"\n\nThe recognition that comes with an Oscar is also not purely a question of economics. \"Of course, getting affirmation from your industry peers is always a great honour,\" Ms Tan said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Chief executive officer Alan Joyce announced the measures as part of his efforts to persuade the Australian government Qantas needs a debt guarantee and to lift a cap on foreign ownership.\n\nMr Joyce last week abandoned a goal to turn the airline's international division profitable by next year, meaning the earliest the Sydney-based company is estimated to post a profit is in 2016.\n\nUnlike the engineers' representatives, the Transport Workers Union (TWU) is urging Qantas employees to consider industrial action if treasurer Joe Hockey doesn't meet with the company to find a way to avoid job cuts.\n\n\"If Joe Hockey's not prepared to do that, then it's industrial action that the workforce should be considering,\" a video clip on the Sky News' website shows TWU national secretary Tony Sheldon saying. \"In this country, if the government won't stand up for jobs and the Australian icon, then we will.\"\n\nSuch action is \"the last thing that would help Qantas right now,\" Prime Minister Tony Abbott said, according to a transcript of an interview he did on Sunday on Channel 10's Bolt Report.\n\nMr Abbott, who's told Qantas to \"put its house in order\" six times over the past three months, said on Sunday that while the government is working to raise the cap on foreign ownership from the current 49 per cent, it's less inclined to guarantee the airline's debt.\n\n\"If you offer it to Qantas, you've got to offer it to Virgin, you've got to offer it to Rex and indeed to any other airlines that put their hand up,\" Mr Abbott said, referring to Virgin Australia Holdings, the nation's second-largest carrier, and Regional Express Holdings, Australia's biggest regional airline.\n\nQantas and Virgin, locked in a market-share battle, are both lobbying the government, with Qantas arguing for a government debt guarantee because Virgin is funded by foreign airlines seeking to weaken the larger carrier. Virgin chief executive officer John Borghetti said that shouldn't happen and Qantas is no longer indispensable to Australia.\n\nQantas chairman Leigh Clifford on Saturday argued in an editorial in the Sydney Morning Herald that competition from Asian and Middle Eastern carriers, record jet fuel costs and weak economic conditions have put pressure on Australia's aviation market. In addition, the foreign ownership cap on Qantas puts restrictions on the airline that don't apply to competing carriers, he said.\n\n\"As well as fixing its own challenges, Qantas needs a fair go in the form of a level playing field,\" Mr Clifford wrote. \"Over the past two years, any illusion of a free market in Australian aviation has been shattered.\"\n\nThe Qantas sale act is \"profoundly unfair\" and needs to be changed, activist and former Qantas shareholder Mark Carnegie said on the Australian Financial Review Sunday programme on Channel 9 on Sunday. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

Ng Hock Ching, a former executive director of Fu Yu, currently holds a 7 per cent stake.\n\nHe is making an offer for 70 million shares at a price of 9 cents a share. The price represents a 3.2 per cent premium to the last traded volume weighted average price of 8.72 cents.\n\nThe offer is made for investment purposes, Mr Ng said in a Singapore Exchange (SGX) announcement yesterday evening.\n\nHis current shareholding was acquired \"at a much higher cost compared to the current share price of the company\" and he wishes to \"average down his overall cost of investment\".\n\nMr Ng added that based on his personal knowledge and observation, the company's shares are thinly traded. He wants to purchase as many shares in the shortest time possible without causing a fluctuation in Fu Yu's share price.\n\nMr Ng added that he intends to remain as an employee after the completion of the partial offer.\n\nShareholders can accept the offer for 10.3 per cent of the shares they hold. They can tender more shares in excess of the relevant percentage if other shareholders do not accept their full entitlement.\n\nThe free float of Fu Yu is currently around 48 per cent. Substantial shareholders are executive directors Tam Wai and Ho Nee Kit, with 13.2 per cent each, and vice-chairman Ching Heng Yang with 12.1 per cent. Former chairman Lui Choon Hay, who has been selling his stake, holds 5.8 per cent.\n\nIf Mr Ng's offer succeeds, he will be the largest shareholder in the company. He currently holds a direct interest of 0.11 per cent and another 6.89 per cent through nominee accounts.\n\nFu Yu was a former stock market darling, with brokers once giving target prices of $1.31 to $1.45 a share. In its fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2013, the company made a $4 million profit, up from $1.4 million in 2012. This was due to the reversal of $5.8 million worth of impairment losses.\n\nMr Ng resigned as executive director in February last year after being charged with securities violations.\n\nThe company's trading halt was lifted yesterday evening after the partial offer announcement.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Chinese buyers are flocking to overseas markets to escape government measures to rein in escalating home prices, including restrictions on buying more than one home and higher capital gains taxes.\n\n\"Chinese buyers are a rising tide,\" said Andrew Wilson, senior economist at Sydney-based real estate data company Australian Property Monitors. \"We'll continue to see a lift in Chinese investment into this country as the Australian dollar continues to fall and as residential property continues to strengthen.\"\n\nAt least 10 Chinese cities, many of them provincial capitals, have tightened local property rules since November, with population centres such as Shenzhen, Shanghai and Guangzhou raising the minimum down payments on second homes to 70 per cent from 60 per cent.\n\nOverseas investment in the Australian housing market fell to A$17.2 billion from A$19.7 billion a year earlier. In commercial real estate, it slid 12 per cent to A$34.8 billion. The report doesn't break down investment in residential and commercial property by country.\n\nTotal foreign investment in Australia fell to A$135.7 billion in the 12 months ending June 30, from A$170 billion a year earlier, the FIRB report showed. The real estate and mineral exploration and development industries were the biggest recipients of foreign investment, accounting for 35 per cent and 30 per cent respectively, the data showed.\n\nThe US remained the biggest investor in Australia, pumping A$20.6 billion into the country, with about a third of that going into services, according to the report. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

Separatists from Xinjiang, home to the Muslim Uighur minority group, were blamed by the authorities for the attack.\n\nBanyan Tree chairman Ho Kwon Ping told BT yesterday that the incident was unlikely to have an impact on the group's three hotels in Yunnan as most of the guests at the hotels do not arrive by train in Kunming.\n\nThe group's Angsana Fuxian Lake Hotel is 11/2 hours away from the train station and is mainly patronised by the locals, while Banyan Tree Ringha and Banyan Tree Lijiang have guests mainly arriving via the airports of Diqing and Lijiang prefectures, respectively.\n\nSingapore's Park Hotel Group, which has a hotel in Kunming under its luxury Grand Park brand, said it has close to 300 staff in Kunming who are all locals. None of them was present at the scene of the incident and all are safe.\n\nBut the hotel has tightened its security and is in close contact with the local authorities on developments, said Park Hotel Group chief corporate officer Mohd Rafin. Given the hotel's proximity to the city centre, 60 per cent of its guests are corporate travellers.\n\n\"Understandably, there is some concern with visiting the city at this point in time. The hotel has received queries from customers who are planning to visit Kunming this week and our team is working closely with the customers on rescheduling their travel dates,\" Mr Mohd said.\n\nSingapore property developers with significant China exposure such as CapitaLand, City Developments, Ho Bee and GuocoLand do not have properties situated in Kunming.\n\nHowever, Keppel Land China runs an integrated resort in Kunming known as Spring City Golf & Lake Resort, which comprises two golf courses, resort homes and resort facilities. All its staff at the resort are safe, a Keppel Land China spokesman said. \"The impact of the incident on Kunming's tourism remains to be seen. Since the incident, we have not received any cancellations for golf games at Spring City.\"\n\nThe attacks in Kunming occurred just before the National People's Congress, China's annual parliamentary session, opens this week.\n\nA spokesman from Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that its Consulate-General in Guangzhou was in touch with Singaporeans in Kunming, and that there have been no reports of affected Singaporeans so far.\n\nA SilkAir spokeswoman said flights between Singapore and Kunming were still continuing as usual.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

United said in January that it expected consolidated first-quarter unit revenue to be unchanged or rise by as much as 2 per cent.\n\nThe filing offered a glimpse at the financial fallout for the US industry from a winter travel season plagued by delays and cancellations outstripping those of recent years.\n\nKevin Crissey, an analyst at Skyline Research LLC, called United's results an \"ugly outcome\" and widened his estimate for a quarterly loss to US$1.46 a share from 62 cents. \"That is a huge hole from which the company needs to climb to have a good annual result,\" Mr Crissey wrote in a note to investors.\n\nAirlines have been struggling with winter storms that pummelled hubs in Chicago, Atlanta and the New York area in recent months, wiping out thousands of flights and disrupting travel for millions of people.

Southwest Airlines Co, the largest discounter, and JetBlue Airways Corp also were affected.\n\nUnited's \"weather impact will exceed that of American and Delta, driven by the fact that Chicago's storm activity resulted in several consecutive days of cancellations\", Jamie Baker, a JPMorgan Chase & Co analyst in New York, said in a note.\n\nA pile-up of scrubbed flights can spur business fliers to simply abandon a trip, while vacation travellers probably stuck to their plans during one-day disruptions elsewhere, wrote Mr Baker, who like Mr Crissey has a neutral rating on United.- Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

A reading above 50 indicates growth, while anything below signals contraction.\n\nThe HSBC release mirrored the official PMI published over the weekend by China's National Bureau of Statistics on Saturday which fell to an eight-month low in February at 50.2. The official PMI covers a larger base and tends to be geared towards larger state-owned firms which perform better than their private peers.\n\n\"The latest PMI surveys confirm the continued slowdown in manufacturing. We think the outlook for the sector remains downbeat,\" wrote Julian Evans-Pritchard, an analyst with research firm Capital Economics, in a note yesterday.\n\nThe HSBC PMI reading showed that new orders and output both contracted for the first time in seven months, while new export orders contracted less than in January.\n\nThe employment sub-index, particularly sensitive to Beijing, also fell for a fourth straight month to 47.2, its lowest point since March 2009.\n\nCauses for the deteriorating manufacturing sector range from slower global growth in developed economies to measures imposed by Beijing to tighten credit conditions and the impact of reforms to move the economy to a more sustainable path.\n\nThough economists caution against reading too much into the data published over the first two months of the year - often distorted by the annual Chinese New year holiday - they say that both sets of monthly PMI seem to point to a definite downward trend of the manufacturing sector, reflecting the overall slower growth of the economy.\n\n\"We think the slowdown is genuine, particularly as tighter monetary conditions over the last few months should have weighed on manufacturing,\" added Mr Evans-Pritchard.\n\nAnalysts said that the 0.8 point decline in January and February combined this year was sharper than the average decline of 0.5 point during the same period historically.\n\nChina's leaders have been adamant in reining in on cheap credit and underground lending with the aim of cleaning up banks' balance sheets. Despite several credit crunches since June, the central bank has so far shown no sign of softening its stance despite slower GDP growth.\n\nThough the government has acknowledged and even welcomed the decline in GDP, the question is just how much of a slowdown is it willing to accept. A strong and healthy employment sector is key to Beijing keen on keeping at bay any social unrest.\n\n\"Signs are becoming clear the risks to GDP growth are tilting to the downside,\" said Hongbin Qu, chief economist for China at HSBC, in a statement accompanying yesterday's PMI results.\n\n\"This calls for policy fine-tuning measures to stabilise market expectations and steady the pace of growth in the coming quarters.\"\n\nBut not all agree with the HSBC economist. China's leaders also know they need to readjust the economy mired in debt and overcapacity in order to create a more balanced economy. At the moment, there has been no clear signs any support measures are underway and the full-year 2014 growth target has yet to be announced during the annual parliament session which opens tomorrow.\n\nAnalysts think a 7 per cent growth target could be announced in order to give Beijing more leeway to adjust to slower growth and implement a heavy reform agenda announced last November.\n\nLast year, China's economy grew 7.7 per cent, steady from the previous year, marking the end of double-digit growth.\n\n\"We do not expect significant policy easing just yet. Policymakers are expected to show more tolerance of GDP slowdown at the National People's Congress, while focusing on reforms for sustainable growth in the long term,\" Yao Wei, economist with Societe Generale, said in a note published yesterday.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/technology/no-clear-leader-among-cloud-vendors", "site_title": "No clear leader among cloud vendors", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nNo clear leader among cloud vendors\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Mar 2, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE cloud distribution method for computing services is creating a new battleground for tech vendors, and is overturning the traditional IT vendor market, according to McKinsey & Company partner Abhijit Dubey.\n\nSpeaking at the Parallels Global Summit in New Orleans, Mr Dubey said the market is wide open right now, with no clear winner leading in the cloud vendor space.\n\nA variety of company-types distribute cloud services. This ranges from IT vendors such as Microsoft or IBM, to telcos which bundle them with connectivity services, to a new breed of cloud companies which sell directly to end-users.\n\nTraditionally, most companies bought their technology from channel distributors such as systems integrators (SIs). These tech vendors took care of the implementation of their customers' systems, bringing a spread of different tech products and services and promising to help with the cumbersome installation of it all.\n\nHowever, the process of buying and using software on the cloud has become a lot simpler. Companies can pay with a credit card online and, often, there is no traditional \"installation\" to speak of, because the software is usable out of the box via a Web browser.\n\nWith the ease of buying on the cloud, it's small wonder that more than 50 per cent of cloud purchases for SMBs (small and medium-sized businesses) are made directly to the cloud vendor, said Mr Dubey, quoting findings of a recent McKinsey survey.\n\nSMBs tend to be more \"no frills\" with their IT, because they have fewer users and customisation needs, so they are more comfortable buying direct from vendors without the need for an SI, he explained.\n\nBut IT firms need to re-angle their offerings for the SMB segment, because it represents 40 per cent of the total cloud opportunity, said the consultant. Around 60 per cent of US SMBs have adopted at least one cloud service, and a quarter have more than five services.\n\nMr Dubey said it is tough getting a return on SMBs because the deal sizes are often smaller than those with large firms, yet acquisition costs remain. \"A lot of SMBs don't survive beyond three years either, so vendors can't recoup acquisition costs,\" he added.\n\nIn order to maximise the average revenue per customer, vendors should plot and predict what their customers want, so they can figure out how to graduate them to more services down the road.\n\nHe said that, typically, e-mail, backup services and customer relationship management (CRM) are the top three cloud services bought as a first purchase. Basic e-mail service tends to lead to more advanced e-mail features, then unified communications, then infrastructure-as-a-service, he said.\n\nOne of McKinsey's customers which sold e-mail services along this track had an average US$5 Arpu (average revenue per user) across 100 users for basic e-mail, and saw this grow to US$11 Arpu at the end of the value chain.\n\nAt a panel discussion at the summit, Simon Lee Smith, Telefonica's director of digital SMB, said the telco is focusing on the SMB segment because that is where the growth is.\n\nHe, too, acknowledged the challenge of approaching end-users, despite how large Telefonica's brand name is. \"We have a lot of connectivity services, but people don't associate us with the cloud yet.\"\n\nThe plan is to take the company's bread-and-butter networking service and bundle it with cloud services when going to market, he said. \"Sure, unified communications is a key area. It's a pretty safe first step for telcos to approach the market,\" he added.\n\nAnother telco has found a different angle to approaching the market. AT&T's assistant vice-president of cloud solutions, Jarrod Barnes, said the company is playing up its reputation for security when appealing to customers.\n\n\"Data breaches and keeping data secure. That's been important when approaching the medical segment, for example, so doctors know that, when they're sharing confidential information, they're safe. Security is a main hit point for us,\" he said.\n\nAnd for Web hosting provider GoDaddy, simplicity is its secret sauce, said CEO Blake Irving.\n\n\"Don't underestimate the power of a single click,\" he said, referring to the company's decision to make hosting buyable within one page.\n\nThe company has also applied this to Microsoft Office 365.\n\nFive weeks ago, GoDaddy inked a deal with Microsoft to distribute the latter's Office 365 service.

The remaining US$32 million will be funded through revenue from the producing wells at the three concessions.\n\nThe wells, located in Thailand's Phetchabun Basin, currently produce at a rate of 1,200-1,400 barrels of oil per day (bpd). Loyz said it expected the production rate to rise to 3,000- 5,000 bpd by December this year.\n\nOperator ECO Orient Energy (Thailand) and ECO Orient Resources (Thailand) have also planned for a new drilling programme for 15 wells for the three Thai concessions. To date, three wells have been drilled, and Loyz expects the remaining 12 to be drilled in the next 12 months.\n\nThis will increase daily production, and cashflows from the production are expected to fund the entire drilling programme, it said.\n\n\"In line with our overall strategy for the group, we will continue to selectively acquire producing assets that will boost our earnings, while maintaining a balanced portfolio of exploration and producing concessions,\" said Adrian Lee, Loyz's managing director.\n\nLast month, Loyz recorded a net profit of $1.567 million for the second quarter ended Dec 31, 2013, on recognition of deferred drilling revenue from the delivery of three wells in the United States.\n\nIts shares closed 12 per cent lower at 32 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The $400,000 cap on the eligible expenditure that firms make will be raised to $600,000 from the 2015 year of assessment.\n\n\"I hope that gain sharing can be part of the criteria of PIC and PIC+. I would like to seriously urge employers to share the profits and gains from productivity with their workers,\" said Mr Tay.\n\nThe fact that the PIC scheme will be extended is proof of the government's recognition that restructuring takes time, said Jessica Tan (East Coast).\n\nSome 80,400 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) tapped the PIC in 2011 and 2012, according to figures from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS).\n\nAbout three in five PIC claims were for the purchase of automation equipment, while 35 per cent were for the training of employees.\n\nNon-constituency MP Yee Jenn Jong of the opposition Workers' Party pointed out that it is the larger firms that would primarily benefit from the PIC, given that many companies in Singapore are micro-enterprises that may not meet the scheme's qualifying criteria.\n\nMr Tharman had revealed in his Budget speech that two in three SMEs with turnover of more than $1 million had claimed PIC benefits to date.\n\nFoo Mee Har (West Coast) described it as \"disheartening\" that productivity in Singapore was flat last year and shrank 2 per cent in 2012.\n\n\"We are now nearly five years into the economic restructuring programme with the government having rolled out one scheme after another,\" she said.\n\nThe economic restructuring efforts, she stressed, need to be \"intensified urgently\", with the government, businesses and workers all playing a role.\n\nLiang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah) noted that although productivity remained flat in the last four years, wage increases could be seen as an \"early indicator\" that things are on the right track.\n\n\"After all, the ultimate goal why we restructure our economy and enhance productivity is to seek better wages and better jobs for the low to middle income,\" he said.\n\nMs Tan (East Coast) cautioned that Singapore might be unable to justify its reputation as a \"high-cost\" country if companies here do not increase their productivity and value.\n\n\"Will Singapore, then, become uncompetitive? Is Singapore able to take advantage of the growth opportunities both locally and globally?\" she asked.\n\nBusinesses should look at developing and acquiring intellectual property, design innovation, new ideas and investment in research and development to move up the value chain and to differentiate themselves.\n\n\"We need to look at how to simplify the various schemes in these qualifying categories to help SMEs acquire new capabilities and strengthen their operations,\" she said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

His response: \"Retirement? I'm going to have to work till I'm dead!\"\n\nBarrow is part of a wave of parents having children into their mid-40s. In 2005, the year she gave birth, the mean age of mothers at first birth was about 25. In 2012, as birth rates fell to a new low among women in their early 20s, the birth rate for women between the ages of 35 and 39 rose 2 per cent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The birth rate for women aged 40 to 44 has risen by 2 per cent annually since 2000.\n\nThe joy of having children is often accompanied by financial anxiety. The life insurance and estate planning challenges, not to mention competing savings needs, are particularly intense for older parents. Should saving for retirement remain the priority? How much of any wiggle room in the budget should be put towards future college costs, or go to increase life insurance coverage? There are no easy answers.

While the Korean giant used that global platform to announce its latest flagship phone, the Galaxy S5, the Finnish phone-maker caught the limelight and surprised everyone by unveiling a new family of smartphones which run on Google's Android OS (operating system).\n\nBefore trying to wrap one's head around this announcement - Nokia is, after all, the lone ranger keeping the Windows Mobile OS flag flying in the smartphone stakes and is soon to become a part of Microsoft - a couple of points need to be kept in mind.\n\nOne is that even though Microsoft's acquisition of Nokia's devices division for US$7.2 billion is a done deal, it has not yet been completed. This means the Finnish company is still an independent entity free to pursue whichever direction it chooses. The other point is that Nokia's X phone line-up uses a \"forked\" version of the Android OS, one in which Google's services have been booted out.

If Canberra is convinced Qantas is in peril, it may have little option but to abandon decades of resistance and provide state aid.\n\nThe executive needs little help making a convincing case: Losses from a domestic price war and international competition are piling up; Qantas is now worth only half what it was when Mr Joyce took the helm in 2007; and its credit rating is now junk across the board.\n\nThe A$2 billion (S$2.26 billion) cost savings and 5,000 job cuts Mr Joyce announced last week represent the airline's most radical shake-up since it was privatised in 1995.\n\nAs yet, Prime Minister Tony Abbott appears unmoved by Mr Joyce's plea for the government to offer a debt guarantee that would lower Qantas's costs.\n\nA change in laws to allow more foreign investment to flow into Qantas, as it has done to rival Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd, is a longer-term proposition.\n\nYet Qantas still has plenty of cash to keep it afloat pending changes, as well as inevitable disputes with trade unions over cutting 15 per cent of the carrier's workforce.\n\nAs Mr Joyce's calls for state support grow louder, so too does criticism of the way he has run the airline. The spotlight on his management has spurred some to call for his resignation.\n\n\"The only way for Qantas to get out of this nosedive is for Alan Joyce and the board to resign,\" said lawmaker Nick Xenophon.\n\nThere's no sign of that happening. The Irish-born executive, 47, promoted from Qantas's low-cost Jetstar unit seven years ago, likes to say that the struggling carrier is fighting lavishly funded competitors \"with one hand tied behind our back\", citing the unfettered foreign funds provided to Virgin Australia and others.\n\nThe law authorising Qantas's privatisation contains a provision that foreign investors may not hold more than 49 per cent of the company: Though officially a domestic airline, Virgin Australia is nearly two-thirds owned by non-Australian carriers - Etihad, Singapore Airlines and Air New Zealand - whose investments have provided funds for growth.\n\nOthers say Qantas's troubles rest squarely with the airline - and in part with Mr Joyce himself.\n\nAnalysts point to what they say are a number of key errors by Mr Joyce, notably the fight to retain Qantas's share of an already crowded domestic market and the failure to get proper lift-off for low-cost subsidiary Jetstar.\n\n\"Alan Joyce came from Jetstar, his performance in Jetstar was pretty good, but Jetstar is a cheap airline and the cheap airlines were quite popular during the global financial crisis,\" said Biyi Cheng, head of Asia Pacific dealing at City Index. \"Since he took over the role at Qantas I haven't seen too much improvement for the company structure or commercial plans to improve the revenue.\"\n\nMr Joyce has dug in his heels in the Australian market, spending on planes and staff to keep Qantas's domestic market share at 65 per cent or above. That has locked the airline in to a deeply unprofitable price war with Virgin Australia.\n\nMr Joyce defended that strategy last Thursday after unveiling A$252 million for the six months ended Dec 31.\n\nThe domestic arm remained profitable but earnings of just A$57 million were a quarter of the A$218 million it made the previous year.\n\n\"We are very clearly protecting our position in the domestic market,\" he told reporters, noting Qantas's dominance of flight schedules gave it a significant advantage. \"It would be remiss of us to weaken that product in any way,\" he added.\n\nMr Joyce does have supporters, who credit him with decent stewardship through competitive times in the Asian airline business, the most attractive in the world with passenger numbers growing faster than in any other region.\n\n\"I think Joyce has done a solid job,\" said Geoff Wilson at Wilson Asset Management. \"It's a lot easier when you are running a company and things are going forward. I don't necessarily think he's the wrong man for the job.\"\n\nStill, analysts say, the brand was weakened in an incident in 2011 when Mr Joyce grounded the entire airline in an attempt to win an industrial dispute, stranding passengers and creating headlines around the world.\n\nThe incident cost shareholders some A$70 million and allowed Virgin Australia, under the stewardship of Mr Joyce's former rival for the top Qantas job, John Borghetti, to ramp up its business, adding lounges and routes and building up an international alliance network. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/313913c544f310da2fbb9596e1bcd0e6aeb7a6a3b2d4c9c4ad291609ead70496?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "The A$2 billion (S$2.26 billion) cost savings and 5,000 job cuts Mr Joyce announced last week represent the airline's most radical shake-up since it was privatised in 1995 - PHOTO: REUTERS"}]}

Yesterday, they surrounded several small Ukrainian military outposts there and demanded the Ukrainian troops disarm. Some refused, although no shots were fired.\n\nUkraine's security council ordered the general staff to immediately put all armed forces on highest alert, the council's secretary Andriy Parubiy announced. The Defence Ministry was ordered to conduct a call-up of reserves - theoretically all men up to 40 in a country with universal male conscription, though Ukraine would struggle to find extra guns or uniforms for significant numbers of them. \"If President Putin wants to be the president who started the war between two neighbouring and friendly countries, between Ukraine and Russia, he has reached this target within a few inches. We are on the brink of disaster,\" Mr Yatseniuk said in televised remarks in English, appealing for Western support.\n\nUkraine has appealed for help from Nato (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), and directly to Britain and the US, as co-signatories with Moscow to a 1994 accord guaranteeing Ukraine's security after the breakup of the Soviet Union. Nato Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen accused Russia of threatening peace and security in Europe before Nato ambassadors met in Brussels to discuss their next steps. Washington has proposed sending monitors to Ukraine under the flags of the United Nations or Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, bodies where Moscow would have a veto.\n\nUS Secretary of State John Kerry bluntly warned Russia yesterday that it risked losing its seat among the prestigious Group of Eight (G-8) nations, as well as economic turmoil, if it fails to pull its forces out of Crimea. Moscow could also face sanctions from its G-8 allies and see American businesses pull out of the country if Mr Putin failed to de-escalate tensions in Ukraine, Mr Kerry said. So far, the Western response has been largely symbolic. Mr Obama and other leaders suspended plans to attend a G-8 summit in Sochi. Some countries recalled ambassadors.\n\nUkraine's tiny armed forces would be no match against the might of its superpower neighbour. Britain's International Institute of Strategic Studies estimates Kiev has fewer than 130,000 troops under arms, with planes barely ready to fly and few spare parts for a single submarine.\n\nRussia, by contrast, has spent billions under Mr Putin to upgrade and modernise the capabilities of forces that were dilapidated after the breakup of the Soviet Union. Moscow's special units are now seen as equals of the best in the world.\n\nRussia has launched an all-out propaganda campaign yesterday to whip up support for possible military action in Ukraine, as state media and ruling party officials claimed armed marauders were terrorising the ex-Soviet nation. Kremlin-controlled media launched a full-scale operation with footage aimed at discrediting the new Kiev authorities and rousing anger at alleged outrages perpetrated against the Russian-speaking population. - Reuters, AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

This was weaker than the 1.4 per cent month-on-month growth posted in January.\n\nOn a year-on-year basis, loan growth stood at 14.6 per cent, which is also poorer than the 16.5 per cent growth seen in January - and is the slowest gain since November 2010, data compiled by The Business Times showed.\n\nThe DBU gains refer to net growth, that is, new loans which have been granted after deducting loans which have been paid off. The DBU figures refer to loans denominated in Singapore dollars.\n\nOn a month-on-month basis, business loans in February grew 0.5 per cent to $358 billion. This is a much smaller expansion compared with the 2.1 per cent growth in January.\n\nLoans to the building and construction segment - which is the largest component of all business loans - contracted in February over the month for the first time since January 2011, BT data showed.\n\nThe 0.2 per cent contraction to $92.4 billion in this segment is in contrast to the 1.4 per cent expansion in January. This also follows two months of expansion since December.\n\nLoans to financial institutions - the next largest loan segment after construction - gained 0.6 per cent to $80.9 billion in February over the month. This is a marked weakness from the 5.8 per cent growth over the month in January.\n\nThere was, however, some strength seen in the manufacturing segment, on a loan-growth basis. Loans to manufacturers grew 2.4 per cent over the month to $32.6 billion, a significant lift from the 0.5 per cent growth posted in January.\n\nAs for consumer loans, the month-on-month growth was 0.3 per cent to $226 billion. This is a touch lower than the 0.4 per cent growth in January.\n\nGrowth in consumer loans is mainly driven by that in property loans, which grew 0.5 per cent to $168 billion. That is the same growth rate posted in January over the month.\n\nThe share of housing loans of total bank loans has risen further to 28.8 per cent in February, said Selena Ling, head of treasury research & strategy at OCBC Bank. \"Hence, it may be premature to expect any early unwinding of property curbs before we see further stabilisation.\"\n\nGrowth in car loans, on a month-on-month basis, has been in negative territory since September 2012, and contraction in this segment has deepened, following car-loan curbs that were implemented in February last year.\n\nIn February, car loans contracted further by 1.9 per cent over the month to $10.3 billion. This compares with a 1.8 per cent contraction in January.\n\nBroadly, the loan to deposit ratio, at 108 per cent in February, \"is still on the uptrend and the highest since May 1998\", said Ms Ling. Still, this is some distance from the record high in October 1997 of 115.6 per cent, she added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Month-on-month, gainers outnumbered losers 358 to 318. But there were 395 losers to 287 gainers on a year-on-year basis.\n\nThe quarter began on a sour note, with January falling in value against December 2013. But the market grew steadily over the next two months, and on a quarter-on-quarter basis total market cap was up 1.8 per cent.\n\nStill, the modest quarterly fortunes were not widely shared, with losers dominating gainers 381 to 317 during the period.\n\nThe quarter got some help from four initial public offerings that added about $1.1 billion of market cap at listing.\n\nThe commerce sector was the best performer during the quarter, rising 13.8 per cent in value versus December, to $168 billion.\n\nOne key mover in that sector was commodities trader Olam International, which is in the middle of a takeover bid by a unit of Singapore investment company Temasek Holdings. Olam's market value is up 44.6 per cent quarter-on-quarter at $5.4 billion.\n\nThe worst performing sector is mining and quarries, which is down 17 per cent quarter-on-quarter at $3.4 billion. Upstream oil and gas production and exploration outfit KrisEnergy was the big mover in the sector, shedding 40.6 per cent of its value since December to close at a market cap of $779.4 million as at end-March.\n\nUOB Kay Hian head of research Andrew Chow said the quarter has seen \"thematic\" rotational flows into laggards rather than fresh flows of funds into the market.\n\n\"The banks did see a bit of a selldown ... Jardine was down because of a slowdown in Indonesia but then had a big rebound,\" Mr Chow said.\n\n\"It's mainly rotational plays. The latest is the switch from Olam to Noble ... and we're now seeing some bargain hunting in oversold developers.\"\n\nThe rotational effect could persist for a while as investors digest corporate earnings.\n\n\"Earnings visibility is not there yet,\" Mr Chow said. \"People are still trying to get a grip on whether earnings consensus numbers are going to start tracking up or go sideways.\"\n\nMr Chow expects plantations to continue to do well, with telcos and some oil services companies appearing attractive. The banks could benefit from any upward revisions to Singapore's economic outlook.\n\nOverall, larger companies performed better than smaller ones during the quarter, with the largest 10 per cent of companies gaining 2.4 per cent in value compared to a 12.7 drop in value for the smallest 10 per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

After all, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had risen more than 12 per cent from its low of 14,776 in early October to its high around 16,588 in December.\n\nThat's considerably more than the average annual move in the blue-chip index. Barring a major leap higher today, the Dow may confirm those suspicions. It closed on Friday at 16,323, 1.5 per cent lower than where it finished 2013.\n\n\"The market may have been ahead of itself in December,\" said Oliver Pursche, president of Gary Goldberg Financial Services. Still, Mr Pursche argues that the gap between those high expectations and the improvement in corporate earnings is now narrowing.\n\nNow that bullish traders have had a quarter to \"digest gains\", they've likely built up an appetite for more stock buying in the second quarter, says Mr Pursche and others.\n\nThere are still shocks to absorb: This week, Janet Yellen will speak again, possibly revealing whether she has intentionally or unintentionally changed the central bank's public outlook on interest rates.\n\nThere could be more evidence of China's unexpectedly severe slowdown. Indeed, Chinese industrial and economic-growth data has been so weak lately that rumours have spread about a new stimulus package from the government there.\n\nSimilarly, a decline in European consumer prices forced the European Central Bank to consider interest rate cuts to stave off the spectre of deflation.\n\nAnd, of course, the 20th century-style military standoff between great powers continues in and around Ukraine. The US has expressed concern at the preparation of what looks like another invasion force on Ukrainian borders north of the Crimea.\n\nOn the bright side, US data should add to the sense of an economy emerging from a barren winter to a fruitful spring. Economists expect a survey of the manufacturing sector to show an increase in activity during March. And Friday's monthly jobs report from the Department of Labor has inspired some of the rosiest forecasts from Wall Street economists in months.\n\nMost anticipate that at least 200,000 new jobs were created during the month, consistent with a healthy labour market. Relatively strong weekly jobless claims reports during March suggested reversals in January and February were temporary and weather-related, said economists at brokerage Nomura Securities in a research note.\n\nSome measures of unemployment, such as the \"U6\" index - a statistic that Ms Yellen reportedly tracks because it includes part-time workers invisible in the other surveys - remain high.\n\nAnd some jobs, particularly in manufacturing, will never come back. Traditionally, technological advances start economic booms and provide the impetus for growth in the labour market. Think of inventions such as the steam engine in the 19th century, or of the personal computer in the late 20th century.\n\nOne thing that has complicated this recovery is that the great technological advances have been in the field of automation. Robots are learning to make cars, and computers are learning to make advertising. While US corporations are more productive and profitable than ever, they are increasing productivity using machines and algorithms rather than new workers.\n\nFor the market to resume its 2013 run, first- quarter earnings reports, which will start to trickle out this week, will have to exceed Wall Street targets. In the sceptical atmosphere of the last three months, many analysts lowered those targets, making it easier for corporations to impress the market now.\n\n\"A lot of people are expecting poor earnings and so that's setting us up for positive surprises,\" said Mr Pursche of Gary Goldberg Financial Services.\n\nOver the last several years, corporate America has learned to eke earnings growth out of cost cuts but that will not be enough to impress investors this time around, according to one strategist.\n\n\"We need to see revenue growth,\" said Quincy Krosby, investment strategist at Prudential Financial.\n\n\"The most salient argument (from those who say) 'this market needs to burn off more froth' is that revenue growth is not commensurate with the market valuation,\" said Ms Krosby.\n\nThe long-bubbling debate on high-frequency trading may come to a boiling point this week. Today, Michael Lewis, one of the most respected authors on the subject of finance, will release a new book entitled Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt.\n\nMr Lewis argues that high-frequency traders have essentially rigged the US stock market for their own profit. The expose follows a recent pledge by New York Attorney-General Eric Schneiderman to crack down on the high- speed traders.\n\nSome analysts on Wall Street claim the stock market could be disrupted if high-frequency traders were kicked out. Others blame the near light-speed computer trading for causing the \"flash crash\" of 2010, the biggest one-day sell-off in recent years.\n\nBullish traders hope that the return of 2013 ebullience will dominate market talk this week, rather than calls for stockmarket reform in the age of automation.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its total borrowings and finance lease liabilities stood at 22.41 billion yuan, of which 13.71 billion yuan is due within 12 months. \"We have signed a framework agreement with over 10 principal banks to establish a debt optimisation syndicate, for the purpose of ensuring our stability of operations and improving our state of liquidity,\" Rongsheng said in a statement.\n\nThe banks include Bank of China, The Export-Import Bank of China and China Minsheng Bank.\n\nChina Rongsheng logged a net loss of 8.68 billion yuan for the fiscal year ending December 2013, much bigger than its net loss of 572.6 million yuan a year earlier.\n\nA builder of Vale's large ore carriers, the company asked the government for financial help last July and warned in December that it faced a substantial full-year loss.\n\nChina Rongsheng said yesterday that it believed the recession in the shipbuilding market had come to an end, and it planned to focus more on large liquified natural gas carriers thanks to increasing demand for new energy sources.\n\nIt also cut the remuneration package of senior and middle management by 30 to 50 per cent from a year earlier. As at the end of December 2013, the company had 4,738 employees, down 28 per cent from the previous year.\n\nRongsheng said that it had won orders to build 23 vessels worth US$726 million last year, well below its target of US$1.8 billion worth of contracts. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

Asahi Group Holdings Ltd, Japan's biggest beermaker, said this month it's forming a venture to start operations there this year.\n\nBecause much of the machinery is too big to fit in regular containers, Japan's Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd and other shippers are increasingly using vessels that can handle oversized cargo. Myanmar is importing basic materials to improve infrastructure after the US, Europe and Japan eased sanctions following elections in 2012 in which the country's leading dissident, Aung San Suu Kyi, a political prisoner for 15 years, was elected to Parliament.\n\nCompanies are building manufacturing facilities in Myanmar, to take advantage of cheaper labour than in China. The country exports gas, rice and wood and is now importing steel, building materials, machinery and other parts to build factories and infrastructure.\n\nMyanmar is also planning to more than double rice shipments as the country that used to be the world's largest exporter of the grain embraces trade and opens its economy, challenging Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia.\n\nShipments may increase to 2.5 million metric tonnes in 2014-2015 from an estimated 1.8 million tonnes in the year that started April 1, according to Toe Aung Myint, director general of the department of trade promotion at the Ministry of Commerce. Exports are targeted to increase to 4.8 million tonnes in 2019-2020, he added.\n\nThe country, the leading rice exporter from 1961 to 1963, saw exports tumble to as low as 15,000 tonnes in 1997, before bouncing back to be the world's ninth-largest shipper with 690,000 tonnes in 2012.\n\nMitsui OSK, operator of the world's biggest fleet, predicts transportation of oversized equipment, which it calls Liner Dry Special (LDS), will double this year, after tripling in 2013. The shipping line uses equipment called flat racks, similar to the bottom part of a container, to transport equipment too big to fit inside regular boxes.\n\n\"LDS shipment volume for Myanmar is growing rapidly,\" the shipping line said. The company predicts more demand for infrastructure and building materials and said the \"outcome is pretty good so far\".\n\nThe company is also boosting its cargo service between Myanmar and Singapore this month to a regular weekly service to improve connections in Singapore, it said on March 13.\n\nMyanmar is planning to improve ports and roads to help movement of goods after the Asian Development Bank said transport networks are insufficient to support growing activity. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

They met with little success and it didn't help that they could hear families enjoying fun-filled Christmas dinners.\n\nIt was a light-bulb moment for them when the idea of how tourists such as themselves could visit local families for a meal popped into their heads.\n\nThey pitched their idea during Startup Weekend in Milan last February, where startup ideas are thrown up. The idea for BonAppetour was well-received, and the duo decided to make it a reality. Giovanni Casinelli, an Italian computer engineer, is also on the team.\n\nBonAppetour currently has hosts in over 50 cities, from Singapore, to Milan, and even in exotic places such as Sao Paulo and Johannesburg.\n\nTravellers search for hosts in cities that they are visiting and decide on whose home they'd like to visit.\n\nSometimes, it is more than just sitting down for a meal in the dining room with a local family. Depending on the host, a BonAppetour experience can include a DIY onigiri-making session in Tokyo, a rooftop dining in Rome, or even a seafood-themed dinner coupled with freshwater fishing in Reykjavik, Iceland.\n\nThe BonAppetour experience for visitors to Singapore feature dining on pen cai, attending a vegetarian cooking class or tucking into some homemade nasi lemak.\n\nMs Wihardjo believes that BonAppetour has been well-received because \"there is a change in the way people travel. More travellers are going off the beaten path, and BonAppetour allows them to do that\", she says.\n\nFor hosts, not only do they get to make some money with their culinary skills but they also get to meet and interact with people from all over the world right in their own homes. The host sets a price on the experience.\n\nWhile there are other similar concepts, Ms Wihardjo says they aim to stand out from the competition \"with the quality of the community that we are building\".\n\nShe explains that hosts are vetted before they are officially part of the BonAppetour community.\n\nHosts are free to decide on the menu they wish to offer.\n\n\"All we want from our home chefs is to be able to offer an authentic home dining experience - be it a signature local delicacy, or a fused creation,\" says Ms Wihardjo. \"Some even go to the extent of engaging the diners by getting them involved in the cooking or they take them grocery shopping so these diners can go back and replicate the dish.\"\n\nMs Wihardjo has big plans for BonAppetour, even though there are already hosts in many cities across the world. \"We aim to make it big, and to do so, we are currently in the midst of recruiting country managers or ambassadors especially in America and Europe. Hopefully with these extra helping hands, we can invite more home cooks to join our community, build stronger relationships with our existing hosts, and conduct local events to knit the whole community closer together.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Significantly, they did not demonstrate any software on Windows machines, telegraphing a departure from former chief executive Steve Ballmer's focus on the personal computer operating software and its own devices.\n\n\"Their absence speaks volumes,\" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. \"Nadella's a cloud-centric guy; he's going to focus on what's been successful, and where the future's going. Windows 8 thus far has been extremely underwhelming.\"\n\nMr Nadella kicked off the presentation with a fluid, low-key introduction to Microsoft's approach to the new mobile, cloud-centric world of computing, in his first public appearance since taking the helm 52 days ago.\n\nDressed in a black polo shirt and dark jeans, the 46-year-old computer scientist threw in some geek humour and lines of poetry from TS Eliot, marking a change in style from his energetic predecessor Steve Ballmer. His lack of references to Windows indicated a deeper strategic shift.\n\nMr Nadella gave no indication of when Microsoft would release \"touch-first\" versions of Office apps for Windows 8, the latest version of the operating software, which he acknowledged had fallen behind in the mobile era. \"The Windows strategy, there's no change, except we want to be known as the innovative company that's coming from behind in some categories,\" Mr Nadella told reporters in an ad hoc question-and-answer session after the presentation, another sign of new openness at the company.\n\n\"If you look at the story of Windows, we lead in some, we have fallen behind in some. We're grounded in that reality,\" he added. \"What we need to be is a challenger there and be able to show what we're capable of doing in these new form factors.\"\n\nApart from the absence of any Windows devices, the Surface, one of Mr Ballmer's prized concepts, was conspicuously missing from a show floor at the event that included Google Inc Android tablets from Samsung and Acer as well as the iPad. Mr Nadella did not mention the poor-selling tablet at all in conversations with reporters.\n\nThe Office apps are free to download from Apple's app store, but to create new documents, users will need a subscription to Microsoft's existing cloud-based service called Office 365. Microsoft's Office 365 Home Premium, designed for home consumers, costs US$100 a year. For businesses it costs US$60 or more per year, depending on features.\n\nApple gets its standard 30 per cent cut of new Office 365 Home subscriptions sold through its app store, but no share of existing Office 365 revenue or multiple subscriptions bought by companies. That is analogous to the way Apple treats magazine subscriptions. \"Welcome to the #iPad and @AppStore!\" Apple chief executive officer Tim Cook tweeted after the announcement. \"Thanks #tim-cook, excited to bring the magic of @Office to iPad customers,\" Mr Nadella tweeted back.\n\nAnalysts have estimated that Microsoft could rake in anywhere from US$840 million to US$6.7 billion a year in revenue from iPad-native Office, although some fear it may have moved too late to grab the attention of many.\n\nEasy to use, touch-friendly work apps like Haiku Deck, Quip, Smartsheet and Evernote, not to mention Google Apps, have quickly gained a following among younger users who have never worked with Office applications, or relish the change.\n\nSources have said an iPad-friendly version of Office - which encompasses such popular applications as Word, Excel and PowerPoint - had been ready for years, but the Redmond, Washington-based company had been reluctant to compromise its signature PC operating system.\n\nHowever, Microsoft's own efforts to produce a touch-friendly operating system capable of challenging the iPad have floundered, with poor sales of its Surface tablet, and a general lack of interest from third party hardware makers in making tablets running Windows 8.

Judge Koh presided over a trial last year that ended with a jury declaring Samsung owed Apple more that a billion dollars in damages for infringing patents with some older model Android-powered devices. The damages award was later trimmed to US$929 million and is being appealed.\n\nIf this new trial goes in Apple's favour, it could result in an even bigger award since it involves better-selling Samsung devices built with Google-backed Android software. This time, California-based Apple is taking aim at Samsung's flagship Galaxy line, crafted to challenge the iPhone in the high-performance end of the market. \"Both in the United States and globally, Apple and Samsung have established themselves as fierce competitors in the smartphone market and fierce adversaries in the courtroom,\" Judge Koh said. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nSingapore ranks among top cities for tech talent as AI job listings surge globally: report\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:37 AM\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

Mr Ong, who joined the board on July 31, 2013, resigned because of \"differing views with management as to the handling of matters relating to and resulting from legal claims from customers\".\n\nFujian Qianfeng Textile Technology Co (formerly known as Fuzhou Jimei Dyeing and Weaving Co) has been embroiled in claims - amounting to 461.5 million yuan in settlement agreements - from customers. The eight claimants alleged that the subsidiary delivered faulty textile products with \"abnormal colour fading contamination problem\", which affected the quality of finished sneakers. Last August, the company entered into the settlement agreements with the claimants, which have since received 300 million yuan in cash compensation last September. The remaining amount (after a 36.9 million yuan discount for early payment) would be deducted from fabric sales over the next five years till July 31, 2018.\n\nBut in March this year, Asia Fashion's China subsidiary was served with notices of arbitration by several claimants. The arbitration proceedings were carried out by three arbitrators in the Fuzhou Arbitration Commission. They alleged that Fujian Qianfeng had breached the terms of the settlement agreements by not fulfilling the obligations in the provisions of products, which was intended to set off against 86.50 million yuan otherwise payable to them. On March 13, the arbitrators confirmed that the terms of the settlement agreements were valid and enforceable, and Fujian Qianfeng was required to provide the compensation by providing the products over a period of 60 months.\n\nAsia Fashion said that Mr Ong felt that the company should have hired a reputable Singapore lawyer, with experience in mainland China, to advise on the arbitration notices and related settlement agreements, legality of the arbitration proceeding and implications of the arbitration judgement. Mr Ong also felt that the company should call on Mr Lin's undertakings to provide 100 million yuan financial support.\n\n\"The board had since requested its Singapore lawyer to engage a Chinese law firm to review the arbitration proceedings and provide its advice to the board,\" said an announcement submitted to the SGX by Mr Lin.\n\n\"The board had engaged a Chinese lawyer to prepare a deed to incorporate assets of Mr Lin, so that the company can draw on his assets to fulfil his undertaking to the company up to 100 million yuan,\" the release added.\n\nAsia Fashion has appointed Kwok Wei Woon, 41, to replace Mr Ong.\n\nIt said that the settlement amount payable will not result in any material impact on its financial position, and the amount of arbitration fees payable by Fujian Qianfeng is not considered material.\n\nMeanwhile, Asia Fashion has engaged PwC to \"perform certain agreed upon procedures with respect to the cash and bank balances\" of its key China subsidiaries - Fujian Jiamen Textile Co and Fujian Qianfeng Textile Technology Co - for the nine-month period ended Sept 30, 2013. PwC has not issued its report.\n\nMr Lin also cautioned: \"Pending the reports from PwC and the finalisation of the statutory audit by Foo Kon Tan Grant Thornton LLP, shareholders should exercise caution in trading in the company's shares.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the company has requested more time to report its financial results for the year ended Dec 31, 2013. It said that the extension was needed as its board would like its auditors to have more time to work with its management to complete and reconcile certain outstanding works, including the compensation to customers which may have a material impact on its financial statements. It also changed its chief financial officer in January after its CFO of 15 months resigned to pursue other career opportunities.\n\nThe company had warned in February that it might report a net loss for FY2013 due to the compensation.\n\nFor the nine months ended Sept 30, 2013, the company sank deeper into the red with a net loss of 420.07 million yuan from a net loss of 28.72 million yuan a year ago after making a 424.58 million yuan provision for the compensation to customers. As at end-September, its cash and cash equivalents fell to 51.96 million yuan from 375.46 million yuan a year ago.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is a 76.5 per cent decline from the $76.08 million a year ago, which was bolstered by the sale of four high-value properties.\n\n\"The low level of transactions this quarter reiterated the persistent stalemate between buyers and sellers,\" noted Grace Ng, deputy managing director of Colliers International. \"Although sellers are now more willing to negotiate in light of the softer market sentiments, it is a buyers' market now - with many adopting a wait-and-see approach in anticipation of price declines on the back of supply pressures in the near future.\"\n\nAmong the 132 properties put up for auction in the first quarter, 110 were put up by owners who sought to use auctions to indicate their serious intention to sell.\n\nThe number of properties put up for mortgagee sale at auctions also rose to 22 - the highest quarterly number since Q4 2010. There was an average of only eight mortgagee listings per quarter last year and an average of six per quarter in 2012.\n\nColliers is expecting the number of properties put up for mortgagee sales to increase, particularly in the high-end residential and retail segments.\n\nMs Ng noted that the pool of potential buyers in the resale market has shrunk, making it challenging for owners to dispose of their properties in the secondary market when they default on their mortgage payments.\n\n\"This is a different situation from the period between 2011 and 2012, when the buoyant property market was further boosted by a low interest rate and high liquidity environment,\" she added. \"Borrowers who were in default of their loan payments could easily sell their properties in the open market on their own.\"\n\nMok Sze Sze, head of auctions and sales at Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), reckoned that the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework, which caps the loan limit at 60 per cent of gross monthly income, has also shrunk the pool of potential buyers for units with higher price tags in the auction market.\n\nThis could likely explain why there was no flying of hands or shouting of bids for properties at recent auctions.\n\nYesterday, only one property went under the hammer at an auction held by JLL - a four-bedroom apartment in Draycott 8 located in the prime District 10 after receiving only one bid at $5 million, or $1,746 per square foot (psf). This represented a $2 million loss for the seller who bought the unit for $7 million in December 2009. The buyer for the 2,863-sq-ft unit was a Chinese national, who declined to be identified but said he was buying the unit to reside in it.\n\nSales of industrial units are also taking a longer time to be sold. Two factory units at WCEGA Tower at Bukit Batok Cresent, owned by TPPL Pte Ltd, were put up for mortgagee sale yesterday but received no bids.\n\n\"Even for non-residential units, we are seeing more end-users rather than investors or those who may consider a dual purpose,\" Ms Mok said.\n\nOverall, sellers may have to accept more haircuts going forward in order to move their units more quickly, she added.\n\nAt the auction held by Colliers on Wednesday, the properties' list was long but only two properties changed hands. One was a 883-sq-ft freehold apartment at The Anchorage along Alexandra Road, which was sold for $1.1 million or $1,246 psf, while the other was a 366-sq-ft shop unit at Peninsula Shopping Centre that was sold for more than $1 million.\n\nEarlier, a strata-titled factory unit at Enterprise Hub in Jurong went under the hammer for $1.21 million, while four adjoining office units at Orchard Shopping Centre in Somerset were collectively sold for $8.55 million.\n\nMs Ng said she expected the total sale value for the auction property market here to come in at $70-80 million for the whole year, a 13-24 per cent decline from last year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/higher-class", "site_title": "A higher Class", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nA higher Class\n\nWith its styling and safety features, the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class could pass for a mini S-Class. By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Mar 28, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE good news about the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class is how radically improved it is. The bad news, especially for current owners of this compact sedan, is how ancient their cars now look. The fourth generation of what was once called the baby Benz now looks less utilitarian and more upmarket. Earlier generations have always mirrored the latest S-Class look but this one is the closest rendition, both in terms of styling and innovations.\n\nThe new C-Class looks like a downsized version of the flagship limousine. The exterior styling is curvaceous with harmonious proportions but it is the interior that is groundbreaking. Where the old C-Class had a basic cabin, the new car has the same design language as the S-Class. The flowing lines and moulded forms feature more high-end materials with equally high build quality. Witness the fine panel gaps.\n\nTwo new features in the cabin stand out. The first is the touchpad in the controller knob's handrest that recognises input using finger gestures. The second is the head-up display, a first not only for the C-Class but for Mercedes-Benz. The reason the brand with the three-pointed star took so long to embrace HUD is that it was waiting for LED technology to evolve in order to produce the perfect virtual image. The result is crystal clear symbols in vibrant colours with superb contrast.\n\nFor the new C-Class, Mercedes-Benz focused on three areas - light weight, safety and aerodynamics. The new car is longer and wider with its wheelbase extended by 80 mm to a whopping 2,840 mm. Yet the new entry-level C200 is actually 100 kg lighter at 1,310 kg because the body shell is almost 50 per cent aluminium.\n\nIn terms of safety, the new C-Class also benefits from the new S-Class' technological innovations. One of them is Collision Prevention Assist Plus, which is a standard feature that employs autonomous braking at speeds of up to 200 kmh to avoid contact with pedestrians and other cars. But it is in the area of aerodynamics that the new C-Class impresses. Its drag coefficient of 0.24 is the best in its class and greatly helps the C250's coasting ability. Lift off the accelerator pedal and the car continues cruising effortlessly. The C250's two-litre four-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine is mated to the familiar seven-speed 7G-Tronic automatic transmission which has been optimised for faster and smoother gear shifts. The turbo unit sends good low-end torque to the rear wheels but it isn't the quietest power plant around.\n\nAirmatic is optional, making the C-Class the first in its segment to be fitted with air suspension. The continuously variable damping allows for Comfort, Sport or Sport + settings, while the steering feel and engine response can also be separately tweaked. At the media launch in Marseille this week, the C250 was sublime in full Comfort mode. The steering is well-weighted and accurate with very good feedback, while body control is excellent even with the high level of ride comfort. Sport mode actually robs it of sensitivity.\n\nThe C250 with a newly developed four-link front suspension (from three links previously) is particularly composed in sweeping curves. Its blend of comfort and handling is admirable, especially for what is essentially an entry-level Merc.\n\nThanks to its design, quality and efficiency, this new Mercedes-Benz C-Class has moved up to a higher class.\n\nsamuelee@sph.com.sg\n\nSPECS\n\nMercedes-Benz C250\n\nEngine\n\n1,991cc turbocharged\n\nTransmission\n\n7-speed 7G-Tronic automatic\n\nMax power\n\n211 hp @ 5,500 rpm\n\nMax torque\n\n350 Nm @ 1,200-4,000 rpm\n\n0-100 kmh\n\n6.6 secs\n\nTop speed\n\n250 kmh\n\nCO2 emissions\n\n123 g/km\n\nDistributor\n\nCycle & Carriage\n\nTel\n\n6298 1818\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

If consumer spending survives that event after a brief interruption, the economy will be on the way to sustainable recovery, analysts say. But some fear that consumption will suffer a more lasting downturn and that progress on ridding the economy of deflation will slow or even reverse as the impact of a pre-tax hike rush to buy and the impact of a weaker yen on energy and other import prices fades away.\n\nIn that case, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) could be forced to apply even more monetary stimulus on top of its already implemented massive easing if the central bank is to hit its 2 per cent annual inflation target and if economic recovery is not to go into reverse again.\n\nMuch of the rise in consumer prices over the past year has been driven by the higher yen costs of soaring imports of fossil fuels in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster and the subsequent shutdown of nuclear reactors. Lately, however, rising prices of consumer durables have added to inflation pressures.\n\nA last-minute surge in demand in February for electronics items, such as computers, televisions and air-conditioning equipment, in advance of the April 1 tax hike helped push up consumer prices overall, both in January and February.\n\nWhile contributions of higher energy prices to consumer price inflation lessened in February, \"the trend of rising prices in a wide range of items such as durable goods has continued\", an Internal Affairs Ministry official was quoted by Kyodo news service as saying yesterday.\n\nMeanwhile, the \"core-core\" inflation index, which excludes energy and food prices, rose 0.8 per cent in the year to the end of February, the strongest rise in 15 years. Core consumer prices in Tokyo, available a month before the nationwide data, rose one per cent in March from a year earlier.\n\n\"We judge that inflation expectations have generally been rising,\" BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda said in a speech last week.\n\nThe economy \"has been following a path towards achieving the 2 per cent price stability target as expected, and we are halfway there\", he noted, adding that \"inflation should reach the 2 per cent goal\" in fiscal 2015.\n\nRetail sales rose 3.6 per cent year on year in February, figures released yesterday showed.\n\nHousehold incomes fell in February, however, and data showed that average monthly household spending in that month declined 2.5 per cent in inflation-adjusted terms from a year earlier to 266,610 yen (S$3,300), marking the first decline in six months.\n\nWhile household demand has been on a rising trend of late, it temporarily declined in February due to the heavy snow, a ministry official told Kyodo.\n\n\"We are not seeing any factor which changes the basic trend of spending,\" the official added, while maintaining the basic official assessment that household spending is \"picking up\".\n\nThe unemployment rate fell to 3.6 per cent in February, the lowest level in more than six years, while the jobs-to-applicants ratio rose slightly to 1.05, indicating that the overall number of available jobs exceeded the total number of job-seekers.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Policymakers also have quadrupled the central bank's balance sheet to a record US$4.22 trillion to drive down borrowing costs.\n\nWidening retirement gap\n\nA 65-year-old who wanted to pay for retirement with annuities tied to bonds needed 24 per cent more wealth in 2013 than in 2005, National Bureau of Economic Research president James Poterba calculated in a research paper released in February. The increase followed a drop in yields on top-rated corporate bonds to 3.8 per cent from 5.4 per cent, according to Mr Poterba, whose organisation is the official arbiter of when US recessions start and end.\n\n\"The magic of compound interest works very slowly when real rates are very low,\" said Mr Poterba, also a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. \"Interest rates that have prevailed for the last few years have made it more challenging for savers to accumulate wealth, particularly if they are trying to do so in a relatively risk-free way.\"\n\nUS Treasury yields are at least 2 percentage points under what they would be otherwise because of the Fed's low-rate policies and stimulus programmes, said William Ford, former Atlanta Fed president who wrote a 2011 paper estimating the impact on savers of monetary easing. That reduces their income by at least US$280 billion annually, his analysis shows.\n\n\"The costs of low interest rates are being ignored,\" Mr Ford said in an interview. \"It is killing savers, elderly savers who are living on life savings that have been conservatively invested.\"\n\nBabyboomers started turning 65 in 2011, and every day for the next 16 years about 10,000 more will join them, according to the Pew Research Center in Washington. About 19.8 per cent of the population will be 65 and older in 2030, compared with 12 per cent in 2000, Census Bureau projections show.\n\nAlmost half of workers aren't confident they will have enough money to retire, according to a survey released this month by the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington. Thirty-seven per cent of non-retirees told a Gallup poll last year they don't expect to quit their jobs until after age 65, more than double the 14 per cent who gave that answer in 1995.\n\nAmericans face a \"crisis\", said Alicia Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, and a former research director at the Boston Fed. \"Five more years of low interest rates are going to make providing one's self with an adequate retirement income extremely difficult.\"\n\nThe financial crunch probably will reduce consumer-spending growth in the next decade and also could hurt career prospects for younger generations, said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist of Mizuho Securities USA Inc in New York.\n\n\"Simple, it is a drag,\" he said. Either they cut spending to boost saving or \"they will just be forced to work longer, making it harder for young people to get jobs or move up the ladder\".\n\nFed chair Janet Yellen, who succeeded Ben S Bernanke last month, was pressed on Feb 11 about the impact of the central bank's policies on older Americans. During her first semi-annual testimony to Congress, she echoed her predecessor's philosophy that difficulty for savers is an unavoidable side-effect of efforts to boost employment and growth.\n\n\"A low-interest rate environment is a tough one for retirees who are looking to earn income in safe investments like CDs (certificates of deposit) or bank deposits,\" Ms Yellen said. \"In a stronger economy, savers will be able to earn a higher return.\"\n\nThe current national average rate on a five-year CD is 0.8 per cent, compared with 2.26 per cent in 2009, according to Bankrate.com. The national average for money market accounts is 0.11 per cent now, compared with 0.48 per cent average five years ago.\n\nUS Treasuries earned coupons of 7.5 per cent two decades ago. Now investing in the US government generates an average coupon of 2.5 per cent, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch US Treasury Index.\n\nThe Fed isn't planning to raise rates soon. At last week's meeting of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, officials repeated their pledge that the rate for overnight loans among banks will stay low \"for a considerable time\" after their asset-purchase programme ends.\n\nThey tapered their bond buying by US$10 billion for a third time, to US$55 billion a month, and predicted that the benchmark rate will be one per cent at the end of 2015 and 2.25 per cent a year later, higher than previously forecast. The rate averaged about 5 per cent in the year before the 18-month recession began in December 2007.\n\nSome seniors are benefiting from the Fed's policies, with mortgage rates the lowest in at least four decades.\n\nRobert Fischl, 69, of Glenville, Georgia, cut his house payments by about US$2,000 a year by refinancing in April 2013. His 15-year loan has a 2.3 per cent annual interest rate, down from 4.63 per cent on a 20-year loan. He also withdrew US$5,000 during the process to help with a US$15,000 sunroom expansion. \"I feel very lucky,\" he said. \"It is a really nice improvement to the house. We use it year-round.\"\n\nRising values\n\nRising home values and record stock prices also are helping some older Americans. The S&P/Case-Shiller home prices in 20 cities climbed 13.4 per cent in December from a year earlier, down slightly from the pace in November which was the biggest gain since February, 2006. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index jumped 30 per cent last year.\n\n\"The best thing that's happened for people looking at retirement is home prices went up and stock prices went up,\" said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank AG in New York. \"US households have never been more wealthy.\"\n\nEven so, men and women 65 and older are staying in the labour force longer: Their participation rate was 18.9 per cent in February, near a 52-year high, while the overall rate held at 63 per cent, near a 36-year low.\n\nPeople are working longer not only because of financial need but also because of improved health and longevity, less physically demanding jobs, more women employees, declines in company-provided retiree health insurance and changes to Social Security, according to Boston College's Ms Munnell.\n\nAs the risk and responsibility of saving for retirement continues to shift to employees from employers, low interest rates could force some younger workers to hold onto their jobs longer than they'd planned.\n\nThe number of 401(k) plans grew to about 513,000 in 2011 from 17,000 in 1984, while active participants increased to 61 million from 7.5 million, according to Labor Department data. In that time, single-employer defined-benefit pension plans fell to about 43,800 from about 165,700.\n\nWhile William Pagdon knows the Fed keeps rates low to boost employment, he doesn't like being collateral damage: He now figures he'll have to work a decade longer than he'd wanted.\n\nMr Pagdon, a 51-year-old scientist who lives in Edison, New Jersey, with his wife and young son, has about 90 per cent of his assets invested in \"very safe, very low-yielding\" bonds and the rest in the stock market, which he fears \"will crumble\".\n\n\"My plan has been deferred about 10 years, so now I'm looking at 65 and not 55,\" Mr Pagdon says. \"Interest rates have caused my savings to stagnate to close to useless.\"\n\nLoomis Sayles & Co vice-chairman Dan Fuss, 80, can see the impact of low rates on retirees at the grocery store near his home in Wellesley, Massachusetts.\n\n\"If you look at the average age of the people bagging the groceries, I want to help them push the cart out; and look at those riding the commuter train at rush hour, a lot of them are my age,\" said Mr Fuss, who managed the two best large US bond funds during the past 10 years.\n\nHe says he's still working because he loves it, yet empathises with those who have no choice. \"The savers are screaming.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/7b54f6568ebf8d02f29efa2216566518ec2bf12376a00c95c2318775cc8b6820?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Mr Gross: The 69-year-old co-founder of Pacific Investment Management Co says that feeble returns on the safest investments such as bank deposits and fixed-income securities represent a 'financial repression' transferring money from savers to borrowers. - PHOTO: BLLOMBERG"}]}

In 2013, fewer big houses were built, but the average size for new homes continued to increase.\n\nAccording to US census data, the percentage of new houses built in 2013 with more than 3,000 square feet of living space declined to 31 per cent from a high of 45 per cent at the peak of the home-building boom in 2007.\n\nAt the same time, the average size for a new home built in 2013 edged towards the 3,000 sq ft benchmark figure, ballooning out to 2,679 sq ft, 160 sq ft more than the previous year, according to the National Association of Home Builders' annual survey of home trends and buyer preferences presented by Rose Quint at the International Builders Show (IBS) in Las Vegas this year.\n\nThe 2013 average house size is also bigger (by 180 sq ft) than the average built during 2007's housing peak, when it was 2,499 sq ft.\n\nThe appeal of ever-larger \"average-sized\" houses can be explained in large part by the changing pool of new home buyers, said Ms Quint. In 2013, the number of first-time buyers purchasing smaller houses fell because of this cohort's difficulty in obtaining financing. With a challenging job market and stricter lending requirements, far fewer of them qualified for mortgages.\n\nComparing the current situation to a \"more normal market\" where first-time buyers would constitute 40 to 45 per cent of new home buyers, Jim Zeumer of the Pulte Group noted that this group made up only about 30 per cent of the new home market in 2013, and for his company, only 25 per cent.\n\nWith proportionately more affluent home buyers in the mix, new homes built in 2013 typically had more upscale features. As a percentage of the total, nearly half of last year's new houses had four bedrooms (48 per cent), a third full bath was a popular option (35 per cent) and a three-car garage (22 per cent) increasingly common.\n\nAs the spring home buying season begins, what features will grace the new houses purchased by this more affluent clientele this year? Querying home builders for their most likely choices from a list of 40 possibilities, NAHB found the winners to be surprisingly modest. The top scorer was a walk-in closet in the master bedroom, a staple of home building for more than 20 years.\n\nThe builders' other top choices reflect buyers' heightened interest in environmentalism: energy-efficient windows, Energy Star appliances and programmable thermostats.\n\nThe builders' \"least likely\" choices for inclusion in a new home in 2014 indicate that Americans' long-standing love affair with two-storey ceilings in the foyer and family room and a whirlpool bath for the master suite is over.\n\nWhat will new houses look like in 2014? Several IBS presenters who follow national trends made a number of predictions.\n\nHeather McCune, the head of marketing for Bassenian/Lagoni Architects, a Newport Beach, California, firm that designs custom and production housing all over the country, said that new home buyers can expect to see more houses combining a contemporary flair with traditional styling and a migration of this aesthetic from urban areas where it has been gaining in popularity to suburbia.\n\nThe interiors will feature more open plans and kitchens with ever larger islands that can easily double as eating areas and work spaces where kids do homework.\n\nThere will be a high level of finishes and detailing that convey \"authenticity\" because today's buyers expect it, she said. Although Tuscan styling has enjoyed enormous popularity over the past 10 years, buyers now want something closer to their own roots, be it Colonial, Mediterranean or Craftsman. Another feature of new upper-end houses: separate bathrooms in the master suite, seen as a necessity for \"marriage preservation\", she said.\n\nZeroing in on the kitchens in new homes, colour is the new variable. Houston-based architect Sanford Steinberg said that he's seeing kitchens with bold colour contrasts or subtle colour differentiation. The bold look pairs white wall cabinets with black base cabinets. The subtle look combines cabinets that are \"warm\" white with counters and backsplashes in a different white, often a granite with gray streaks or some other natural colouration. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

This double-decker vehicle, owned and operated by Singapore public transport firm ComfortDelGro's (CDG) UK subsidiary Metroline, is called the New Routemaster. The hybrid bus has been plying the streets of London since 2012; the plan is to have more than 600 of them in operation by 2016.\n\nSeated on the upper deck, Mr Lee peppered CDG chief executive (UK and Ireland) Jaspal Singh with questions about the company and about London's public transport system in general. Mr Singh, a Singaporean who has been overseeing the group's investments in Britain since 2004, is a former career civil servant who rose to become deputy secretary in the finance and transport ministries in Singapore. Mr Lee was keen to know, for example, how CDG maintained its fleet of buses, the costs of running hybrid vehicles and the fare system in London.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Mar 28, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIN a field dominated by men, Paola Navone is a breath of fresh air. The 64-year-old Italian is an architect, product designer and interior designer all rolled into one. She is greatly admired by her peers and fans and talks to you like a good friend even on a first meeting. She does not play the diva card nor does she mince her words.\n\nIn Singapore for the recently-ended Maison & Objet Asia fair to give a talk, Ms Navone mentions that a member of the audience describes her style as \"shabby chic\". \"I'm shabby but not chic,\" says the woman with spunky hair, breaking into laughter. \"My style is more soft, when it comes to interiors and products,\" she says.\n\nHer list of clients is an impressive one, all big names including Gervasoni, Armani Casa, Knoll International, Alessi, Dridade and Molteni. On the interiors-front, she has designed the Pane E Aqua restaurant in Milan, Point Yamu by COMO resort in Phuket, and the upcoming Metropolitan by COMO at Miami Beach.\n\n\"Regardless of whether it is a building, a space or a product, I take the same attitude. The way I start on a job is always the same. The way I look at a problem is always the same,\" she says.\n\nShe describes her mind \"as a big basket. I remember things that I see, and when I need something, ideas just pop up in my head, much like popcorn.\" This explains why to her it is not about where a person travels to, but \"observing is more important. An image, shape, smell ... everything goes through my mind,\" she says. Being constantly curious, she says, has also led her to where she is today, and is what keeps her going.\n\nWhile she has gained much success, she says that \"everything in my life is an accident. I didn't plan for any of it\".\n\nShe explains that in the early 1970s, there were no design schools, so she studied architecture. \"Then later I discovered people who were doing things in a different way, and I became so attracted by design.\"\n\nMs Navone graduated in 1973 in architecture from the Turin Politecnico. From then till 1980, she worked alongside Alessandro Mendini, Ettore Sottsass Jr and Andrea Branzi in the Alchimia group, the most progressive set on the Italian design scene, developing a highly productive and stimulating avant-garde stance which gained her, in 1983, the prestigious Osaka International Design Award, bestowed for the first time that year.\n\nEven landing the job of designing COMO resorts, owned by Christina Ong, \"was an accident\". Ms Navone recalls: \"I met Mrs Ong many years ago, through a friend of a friend. One day, she asked if I would be interested in doing a resort in Phuket. I found it a challenge as the brand is famous for its quality and service,\" she says.\n\nPoint Yamu is COMO's first resort in Thailand outside Bangkok and it is also the first to be designed by Ms Navone. The collaboration sees COMO's signature clean lines and pared-down, contemporary style united with Ms Navone's eclectic, colourful approach and the use of local materials. Guests can expect a dazzling palette of bright aquamarines and hot oranges, with Thai artisanal techniques such as traditional wood tiling and woven rattan adding texture.\n\n\"At the end of the project, I've built a special relationship with Mrs Ong, because she is a very special person,\" says Ms Navone. \"Mrs Ong is clear about what she wants, working with her comes with no complications.\"\n\nMs Navone adds in the same breath, \"I'm spoilt. I don't like to spend my energy convincing people of my ideas. If you have doubts about what I do, then don't take me on,\" she says. \"But I'm flexible and I don't mind if you tell me when you don't like something.\"\n\nThis explains why for some other designers, good design is about form and function, but for Ms Navone, it is simply \"what you like. There is no such thing as good or bad design. I like what I like\".\n\nShe has more than 200 products to her name, but says that she uses very little of what she has designed. \"I know them too well already.\" She lets on that she likes shopping at antique shops and buying from young designers. \"I buy plenty from them all the time,\" she says. She nods in agreement when asked if this is her feminine side coming out, but quickly adds: \"I buy many things but I'm very clear about what to buy. I'm very choosy and I don't shop on impulse.\"\n\nThese days, creating a new product collection keeps her busy. She's keeping mum about which brand it is for, but hints that it is for a historical cutlery company. \"Of course, I hope to find another project in Asia, so that I can come here more often,\" she says.\n\nHer dream project is to design a resort in Greece. \"The sea is beautiful and blue, and since I was a child, I've often taken summer holidays in Greece,\" says Ms Navone, who enjoys being close to the water because it gives her renewed energy. \"It is just too bad that I have yet to find a client.\"\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

DEBBIE YONG looks at our booming cocktail bar scene, and how it got to where it is today\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Mar 27, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nAT 25, he drew a cushy $5,000 monthly salary as an army regular, owned a car and an HDB maisonette, but Aloysius Chon was itching for a little more. So he signed off from the army after a seven-year stint, and three months ago, signed up as The Library's newest bartender-in-training.\n\nThough his new job comes with a more than 50 per cent paycut and work hours that often stretch till early morning, Mr Chon says it is a decision made without regret: \"When I came for the job interview and saw these huge shelves of alcohol, I realised that there is plenty to learn in this craft.\"\n\nAcross the island, stories of new-found fascination echoing his play out in the lives of former Goldman Sachs bankers, air stewardesses and commercial photographers. Regardless of background, the new faces to the local bar scene are all magnetised by one thing: our city's voracious thirst for well-crafted cocktails.\n\nBoomtown Singapore\n\nThere are no official statistics specific to cocktail bars, but more than 20 bars specialise in cocktails in Singapore today - up from what industry veterans estimate to be just two or three bars five years ago. Around 10 new cocktail destinations have sprouted up in the last six months, with at least five more set to join the fray in the coming six months.\n\n\"The cocktail scene has exploded in the last decade in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, and with the mix of people in Singapore that travel frequently between these countries; it's no surprise that the awareness and interest in cocktail bars are rising here too,\" notes Howard Lo of month-old cocktail bar, The Secret Mermaid.\n\nLocal bartender Eugene Chua of Ah Sam Cold Drink Stall adds, however, that \"the West may be driving the cocktail agenda, but Asia is quickly riding the wave\".\n\nDespite a traditional Asian inclination towards karaoke bars and ostentatious nightclubs as affluent Singaporeans develop a palate for the finer things in life, they too are favouring cocktail bars for their heightened intimacy and focus on fine spirits in thoughtfully themed environments, he says.\n\n\"In food-obsessed Singapore, it's an easy jump to getting interested in learning about wine. And then cocktails. And then spirits themselves,\" adds Spencer Forhart of American spirits-focused bar, 28 Hong Kong Street (28HKS). More than just seeking and spending on quality tipple, the region's excess of wealth has pushed many to want a bar to call their own too.\n\nFormer Hollywood French photographer-turned-bar owner Pierre Emmanuael Plassart of two-month-old Neil Road bar L'Aiglon, says: \"For my first business venture, I wanted to open somewhere corruption-free and vibrant, and Singapore fit the bill perfectly. Hong Kong is too competitive, and upcoming cities like Bangkok and Jakarta are less safe.\"\n\nIn fact, where cities such as Tokyo and Hong Kong once stood at the vanguard of Asia's cocktail culture, the tables are slowly shifting, with much of the region also turning to Singapore for innovations on the cocktail front.\n\nWhile previously overlooked for our limited market size relative to Asian neighbours such as Taiwan, South Korea or Vietnam, Singapore is now an obligatory pitstop pencilled into the Asia itineraries of alcohol ambassadors from major alcohol companies such as Pernod Ricard, Bacardi, Diageo, Moet-Hennessy and William Grants and Sons as well as visiting bar owners of leading overseas bars.\n\nTanquery Ten Gin's global ambassador Angus Winchester recalls his first trip to Singapore 15 years ago, when \"the scene was non-existent\". \"I was teaching people how to make simple mixed drinks. Now I have to field questions about modernist bartending techniques and trends to keep them interested.\"\n\nThe cocktail boom is fuelling growth in tangential businesses too. From initially importing hard-to-get craft liquors for 28HKS, Mr Forhart and his partners later spun off import and distribution business Proof & Company Spirits to plug what they found to be an overall industry gap. They now distribute over 30 American craft spirit labels and offer consultancy services in staff-training constructing and stocking new bars.\n\nJonathan Liu of independent spirits importer, Rockustar Spirits, and The Secret Mermaid's Mr Lo, who also runs American craft liquor import business, Liberty Spirits Asia, cite Singapore's status as a major trading port and trend driver in the region and its clear customs laws as reasons for starting up here before fanning operations across Asia, says Mr Lo.\n\nProof & Company opened its Hong Kong office last year, while Liberty Spirits has plans to expand to Hong Kong and Shanghai.\n\nEven hotel bars have had to up their game to keep pace. Fairmont Hotel's new Antidote bar has a heavy cocktail focus, the upcoming Manhattan bar at the Regent Hotel will barrel-age their own concoctions, while the Four Seasons Singapore has roped in renowned Spanish mixologist Javier de las Muelas to add star power to their One-Ninety bar.\n\nBut just how did Singapore - once little known on the cocktail front except for being the birthplace of the legendary Singapore Sling - nudge its way towards pole position?\n\nSome trace the cocktail scene back to the 1990s, where flair bartenders - barmen - who not only make drinks but flip bottles and tools as part of the show - in now-defunct nightspots such as China Jump, Centro and Devils Bar defined bars as more than just destinations for fast-paced guzzling.\n\nThen came along players such as Klee, followed by Bar Stories and Nektar, where an emphasis on making cocktails from fresh tropical fruits and herbs catalysed a new movement in pushing local mixology beyond classic Western recipes. The former also groomed a generation of local bartenders such as Ethan Leslie Leong, Jeff Ho and Din Hassan, who now work in bolder, uniquely Singaporean flavours such as chilli crab, kaya and tau huay into their concoctions, while playing mentors to the next generation of local bar talents.\n\nToday, almost every school of bartending recognised globally is represented in the splay of cocktail bars here: the Tippling Club popularised cocktail-pairing menus with its molecular tipple; Coffeebar K and Jigger and Pony - the latter with award-winning frontman Aki Eguchi - fly the flag for Japanese techniques; The Cufflink Club and House of Dandy push the British-inspired envelope; The Horse's Mouth and The Library take a leaf from the speakeasy trend; and Bitters and Love and The Spiffy Dapper are your friendly neighbourhood bars.\n\nVeteran flair bartenders Jeremie Tan, Shahmil Lin and Mamat Suali reckon the surge of global competitions and educational classes by foreign bartenders have helped the scene stride forward - something they wished they had in their time. But with increased media and social media coverage of the beverage industry, plenty of learning is now self-driven too: The Library's Mr Chon watches videos of bartending competitions on YouTube to glean ideas while Mr Chua always makes research visits bars in other cities to pick up tips for his own bar, even when on personal holidays.\n\nKlee founder Tan Ken Loon, who now runs The Naked Finn, additionally credits the growing prestige of the job as a push for the industry's growth. A few years ago, a bar manager would draw a monthly salary of $2,200, but one can make double that today. Bartender salaries now typically start at $2,000.\n\n\"Bartending is now seen as a viable career,\" adds Colin Chia, Asia Pacific manager for the Diageo Reserve World Class, a global bartending competition that has sent top bartenders to apprentice at top bars and attend cocktail conferences in Europe. Other initiatives such as the Diageo Bar Academy and Ketel One Bartender Fraternity aim to band a community of upcoming bartenders together for collective innovation.\n\n\"Back then you'd never be able to go near another bartender's notebook,\" recalls Din Hassan. These days, they pool together resources to order bar tools from overseas websites and lend each other their books on bartending, he says.\n\n28HKS hosted its inaugural The Bartender's Allowance, a friendly monthly competition organised by bartenders for bartenders this Monday, while the Singapore Bar Industry Accord Awards, an industry-voted bar rankings was launched by bar manager Tron Young last Sunday.\n\nBut even as the road ahead is paved with good intentions, bar operators warn of potential potholes.\n\nAs F&B groups large and small eye the cocktail bar niche, there is a limit to how much talent the industry can produce, notes Jeff Ho, now head barman at Jekyll and Hyde. Local culinary schools have few bartending courses, and even so, they may not equip bartenders with practical know-how that only time spent on the job can hone.\n\nWith the glamorisation of the profession, \"many are in a hurry to learn enough of the basics to then skip straight to being a 'star-tender'\", cautions bar consultant Richard Gillam of Liquid Playground. Laments are also rife over the price tags of the liquid libations as they become more trendy. Prices range from $18 to $36 per cocktail.\n\nGlobal cocktail map\n\nThe question remains then: will Singapore ultimately catch up with London and New York to claim its place on the global cocktail map one day?\n\nThough Maison Ikkoku's Ethan Leslie Leong predicts that the market has space for another 20 more cocktail bars, his veteran bartending peer Anthony Zhong believes that given Singapore's small population and limited customer range, \"it'll be very hard to grow a market like that of New York and London's\".\n\nBut what we lack in sheer numbers, we can make up for with what Singapore has always does best: melding a range of cultures to form our own identity, say bartenders.\n\nSo what will the recipe for version 2.0 of the Singapore Sling look like?\n\nA jigger of American confidence, a pony of British sophistication blended with Japanese techniques and a flare of Singapore flavour?\n\nWe'll drink to that.\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But as celebrities ranging from the late L'Wren Scott to street style-star Olivia Palermo adopted the iconic scarf as their sartorial calling cards, even during the summer months, fashionistas here also warmed up to the elegant eye candy. And a new wave of homegrown retailers are cashing in, hoping to entice shoppers with their impeccably crafted works of wearable art.\n\nFor multi-label boutique Inhabit, the launch of in-house silk crepe de chine scarves, exclusively designed by artists and fashion designers and sold together with an anniversary book, helps cement its status as a creative force in the local retail scene. The book, simply titled X, was created to celebrate the fashion store's 10th anniversary and features interviews with artists and designers who have collaborated with the retailer.\n\n\"We thought we should get 10 designers to design an object each to make it more special and to have a surprise element to whichever book you pick up,\" says a spokesman for the store. \"We decided on scarves because they are luxurious, versatile, and one of the most celebrated fashion accessories.\"\n\nBut as much as the old-school accoutrement may be a fashion classic, it took a huge leap of faith for Singaporean Euny Lim to give up her business development job and set up a scarf label in 2012.\n\nWhen asked if she predicted the demand for the accessory, the owner of the Era Ora brand replied, \"I thought that there wouldn't be at first, given the climate but I was pleasantly surprised with the response. Also, it helps that the scarves are made of a cashmere modal fabric which is quite lightweight and soft so it can be worn in climates such as Singapore's as well.\"\n\nUp to about three years ago, scarves were not easy products to sell, unless they were designer pieces by the likes of Hermes, says a representative for Inhabit, which also stocks the printed designs by French labels Forget Me Not and Pierre Louis Mascia. But in the last few years, a few graphic designers and illustrators have created works of art on scarves, \"making these diaphanous squares more and more desirable\".\n\nNods to fine art\n\nOne entrepreneur to have tapped the artistic appeal of scarves is Ondina Montgomery, who works with artists on creating exclusive seasonal designs, which are reproduced on silk scarves and kaftans for her brand MAH (Mad About Hue).\n\n\"MAH is all about sourcing great emerging artists and working with them to place their artworks onto textiles and fabrics,\" says the Danish-born, Singapore-based founder of the art scarf brand. \"We have done this successfully to date and as we are a boutique, limited-edition brand, we really focus on a market that is more exclusive than the established brands in many cases.\"\n\nSimilarly, the designs by Ms Lim are often nods to fine art. The graduate in studio art and business from the University of South Carolina has been influenced by the Surrealist movement and counts works by such artists as Andy Warhol and Salvador Dali whom she studied in school as inspirations.\n\n\"I like to create designs that push the boundaries of reality and tend to drift towards those that inspire and fuel the imagination,\" says the designer, who starts off by creating hand sketches before testing out colour combinations on the computer. \"Surrealism was the theme of my second collection (in the Atelier line) and will continue to be for the third collection, at least.\"\n\nApart from their originality, another reason scarves by homegrown labels are being lapped up may be their competitive price points. Inhabit retails its book and 100cm x 100cm scarves for $250; while prices start from $196 for a 90cm x 110cm modal and cashmere Era Ora design.\n\nA Hermes scarf, in contrast, could go for upwards of $1,000. But the newcomers to the industry nevertheless boast a few artisanal touches: The silk designs by the two retailers feature hand-rolled hems - a time-consuming and costly process for a luxe finish; while MAH scarves are also hand-crafted in a small workshop. Most designs are digitally printed to reproduce the intricate details in a design.\n\n\"As for the printing process, because cashmere fabric has longer fibres than other fabrics, static produced during printing often cause these fibres to catch on to other ink colours, creating defective spots,\" explains Ms Lim. \"Hence, the process can prove to be quite costly as many pieces end up getting discarded for defects.\"\n\nSuch attention to detail is all the more warranted considering how scarves have come to double as artworks to be showcased. A customer bought all 10 designs available from Inhabit's special range, for example, and had them made into giant cushions for her home. The abstract prints by Era Ora and MAH also beg to be framed and hung on walls in lieu of traditional paintings.\n\n\"Wearable art is not a hard leap for anyone with discerning taste,\" says Ms Montgomery. \"Take my capsule collection that coincided with the Naoko Tosa exhibition at the Art Science Museum last October. I pre-sold 25 per cent of the limited-edition collection. This is something established brands can't afford to do at the prices MAH offers. These are truly collectible art pieces.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Mar 28, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nPERSONAL mobility has never been cooler or more comfortable. The Renault Twizy is a plug-in electric quadricycle that seats two - in tandem like on a motorcycle - but has all the comfort and useability of a small car. With four wheels for stability, the Twizy is an ultra-compact vehicle at 2.34 metres long, 1.24 metres wide and 1.45 metres tall. There is a steering wheel, accelerator and brake pedal but no gear lever - only buttons to select Drive, Neutral and Reverse. A small LED screen conveys speed, range and distance data, along with other pertinent information but apart from an underdash parking brake, that's it. But there is also front wiper, airbag, front bucket seat and three-point seatbelts for both occupants. No helmet is required.\n\nThe back seat is actually less of a seat and more like some padding and the hollow of a bodyshell to sink into, yet it is surprisingly comfortable with good headroom. As for legroom, your knees hug each side of the front seat but there is space to stretch your legs. So even if you're six feet tall, sitting in the back will not be an exercise in claustrophobia. Only the front seat headrest will block some forward visibility but fortunately, it is relatively slim. At just 474 kg, the Twizy's power-to-weight ratio is, as expected, excellent. Floor the throttle and it leaps forward with a furious whirring of the motor.\n\nYes, the pair of scissor doors do not come with windows, so there are all kinds of road noise (there is no air-con or blower either). But polycarbonate quarterlights ensure minimal rain enters the cabin while on the move.\n\nThe steering is direct and the ride firm, thanks to a chassis designed by Renault Sport. The Twizy's suspension set-up comprises MacPherson struts in front and behind. Lithium-ion batteries power the 17 hp electric motor in the back, which drives the rear wheels. Renault's Formula One department developed the Twizy's (Kers) Kinetic Energy Recovery System. To charge the batteries, open a flap in front, uncoil the cable and plug it into a household socket. An empty battery will be be fully recharged in 3.5 hours, after which the Twizy can travel for 100 km.\n\nRenault distributor Wearnes Automotive is seeking approval to register the Twizy, which it says is likely to cost the same as an average motorcycle without COE. When it does, this green urban vehicle with maximum fun and style is sure to get everyone in a tizzy.\n\nsamuelee@sph.com.sg\n\nSPECS\n\nRenault Twizy Electric motor:\n\nMax power\n\n17 hp\n\nMax torque\n\n57 Nm\n\nBattery\n\n6.1 kWh lithium-ion\n\nTransmission\n\nSingle-gear direct drive\n\n0-45 kmh\n\n6.1 secs\n\n30-60 kmh\n\n8.1 secs\n\nTop speed\n\n80 kmh\n\nRange\n\n100 km\n\nCO2 emissions\n\n0 g/km\n\nContact\n\nWearnes Automotive\n\nTel\n\n6471 3313\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These two lines often come to mind when I am enjoying wines from particularly neglected vintages, unfashionable Domaines and Chateaux. \"The time has come to talk . . .\"\n\nVintages. The big problem here is the hype - the hype in the wine press about great vintages, even before the grapes have ripened, even before the wines have even been tasted. One recalls the flood of words hailing Bordeaux 2000 vintage as THE vintage of the century. Sending everyone into a frenzied search for the greats - Latour, Lafite, Cos, and the like, in Bordeaux - when the en primeur campaign opened. And in Burgundy the search for DRCs, the Ponsots and Armand Rousseaus and Dujacs, etc was like looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow - frenzied buying and demand, astronomical prices.\n\nThe wiser ones bide their time, and opportunely a year later quietly pick up the cabbages, the 2001 or 2002 vintage of the same wines. I recall Latour 2002 opened at the modest price of 76 euros when in 2000 it opened at 170 euros! Latour 2000 reached a high of 1,200 euros in early 2011, since then dropping and now hovers around the 1,000 euros (S$1,740) mark. Latour 2002 today averages 600 euros per bottle. Still expensive but less formidable.\n\nAn additional advantage? The \"cabbages\" are drinkable at an earlier age. I wrote about the Latour 2002 drunk very recently. Still youthful, but unmistakable Latour character, and very enjoyable. A Latour without make-up! A paler version but unmistakably Latour. Latour 2000 is still youthful and would need a further four to five years for full development. I have not touched a single bottle yet. Perhaps . . .\n\nAnother point about cabbages. And this is a particularly Oriental slant. In this part of the world, it is not regarded as sufficiently respectful to serve or offer as a gift, a lesser vintage (\"cabbages\"). Only a \"king\" vintage would do. We need to get away from this notion imprinted into our psyche (by the wine press and propagated by the \"brain-washed\" public) that only five-star vintages are worthy of our consideration (and vocabulary).\n\nAnd as for \"kings\", there are grades. Shades of the Bordeaux 1855 classification. Only the Firsts and perhaps the \"Super-Seconds\". In this latter group, one might include Cos d'Estournel, Palmer, Pichon Lalande, Angelus.\n\n\"And whether pigs have wings?\" What an imaginative way of framing the question! A particularly apt example of this is Chateau Pontet Canet, about which property I wrote in this column last week. A long-neglected property with well-located vineyards in Pauillac, brought back to its rightful position by the right owner, and it now has its \"wings\" restored. Yes, pigs can have wings.\n\nWithin this porcine group, one would view Vieux Chateau Certan, a Pomerol property, now scaling great heights under the stewardship of Alexandre and Jacques Thienpont. This is one of my favourite Pomerols, its content of 10 per cent Cabernet Sauvignon and 30 per cent Cabernet Franc giving it a more reserved complexion in comparison to Pomerols with almost 100 per cent Merlot. Nothing wrong with 100 per cent Merlot - it just happens that I prefer a less voluptuous complexion!\n\nThinking of other \"pigs with wings\", I would for example point to the properties in the Cote de Beaune which tend to be all but completely overlooked. There is a sort of \"Economy Class\" label hanging over their heads - I am referring to the reds, not the whites. Drouhin and Jadot make some lovely Beaune Premier Cru reds, eg Drouhin's Beaune Clos des Mouches Rouge, Jabot's Beaune Bucherottes.\n\nFurther south are the villages of Volnay and Pommard. In Pommard, I would nominate those most certainly possessing wings - Montille, d'Angerville, Lafarge, Gaunoux, and A. F. Gros. I am reminded in particular of Michel Gaunoux, now sadly passed on, who made wonderful Pommards. My last bottle of his Pommard 1er cru Les Epenots 1985 was happily shared with friends in Jakarta in July 2005, with great pleasure, but also with a tinge of regret as I knew that there would be no more. This bottle was the last of a case of six purchased in 1990 at \u00a323.50 per bottle. Pigs with wings!\n\nRhone comes to mind easily because of these famous names - Jaboulet, Guigal, Chave, Rayas, Pegau and Beaucastel. But it is the famous names in conjunction with their famous wines - La Chapelle of Jaboulet, La Mouline, Landonne and La Turque of Guigal, Celestine of Henri Bonneau, etc.\n\nWine lovers tend to turn up their noses at the mention of Cote du Rhone - as much from snobbery as from the \"just passable\" quality of most producers. And regretfully, most times, from ignorance.There are however two in my experience that deserve to have noses remain at their normal elevation. Chateau Rayas, for one, makes \"a pig with wings\" - his Cote du Rhone La Pialade. A simple Cote du Rhone, but distinguished by its pedigree, purity and simple elegance.\n\nLa Pialade 2002, Chateau Rayas, drunk a few months ago at home was amazingly able to cope with curry chicken. Surprisingly light tawny with reddish tints, it nevertheless showed a sweet nose of ripe fruit, prunes and other dried fruits; light-bodied on initial mouthful, with a very agreeable taste of perfectly ripe fruit, prunes and a touch of citrus. It grew bigger with airing in the glass, was well balanced with good freshness and a good clean finish. An amazing wine, a small appellation but a gem.\n\nAnother thoroughly recommendable \"pig with wings\" is the perennially popular Cote du Rhone from Guigal. Almost dependable, and very inexpensive. One of the best price-value wines available and one of the most widely available whereas Pialade, while similarly not expensive, is not readily available.\n\n\"Of shoes - and ships - and sealing wax -\" Disparate objects. Here I would bring up those beauties from other French wine regions, notably Rhone, Alsace and Loire; and from other countries - Italy, Spain, Germany, Austria, the Napa Valley in the United States, Australia, South Africa, South America.

The two Iranian nationals were able to board the plane in Kuala Lumpur using passports that were reported stolen in Thailand.\n\n\"The lesson that we need to learn from these kinds of incidents that happen now is the importance of technology to be accessible to all law enforcement and mainly immigration officers in accessing and integrating all the available police data,\" Julia Viedma, Interpol's director of international partnerships and development, said in Singapore on Wednesday.\n\nThe agency is in discussions with partners such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to enhance border security at airports and other checkpoints in some of the countries with some funding from the European Commission, she said. Interpol's goal is to make the data assessable regardless of the country's economic status, she said.\n\n\"It's not the idea of if I'm a rich country I'm able to buy myself the technology that I need, if I'm a poor country I'm not able to do it,\" Mrs Viedma said. \"We need to really try to make these differences disappear.\" Passport theft or loss is common in Thailand, with Russian, British and French passports the most commonly reported as missing last year, according to data from Thai police. About 2,475 losses were reported from the top 10 nationalities combined, data show.\n\nLyon, France-based Interpol, has warned since at least 1973 about the increased use of counterfeit passports as international tourism boomed. Criminals have made and used false passports and altered authentic travel documents for uses including for trafficking and smuggling, the agency said.\n\nOnly a few countries systematically search Interpol's databases to determine whether a passenger is using a stolen or lost travel document, the agency said in an earlier statement. More than 800 million searches are conducted annually, and stolen or missing passports are found an average of 60,000 times a year, Interpol said.\n\nThe challenge for Interpol is to persuade governments - rather than airlines - to enforce stricter immigration checks when travellers leave their countries, said Philip Baum, managing director at Green Light, a London-based provider of security training and consultancy services.\n\nIn most countries, airlines can't access the Interpol database, he said, limiting the checks to border security agencies.\n\n\"Most immigration authorities around the world are primarily worried about who is coming into their countries, not who is going out,\" Mr Baum said. \"Immigration authorities tend not to see aviation security as being their responsibility.\" The use of stolen passports raised concerns earlier that the disappearance of the plane carrying 239 people may be connected to terrorism. Austria and Italy said that passports used by two male passengers were stolen from their citizens.\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said on Monday that the jet's last position was in the middle of the Indian Ocean off Australia's west coast and the flight ended there, based on satellite data from Inmarsat.\n\nWhile there is no evidence that the two passengers had any connection to the March 8 disappearance of the Boeing 777-200 en route to Beijing, the security breach should be a rallying call for governments to act, according to Rohan Gunaratna, head of the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies' International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research in Singapore. He estimates that fewer than 30 countries screen all traffic through the Interpol data base.\n\n\"People don't want to do it because it's added work, added responsibility,\" Dr Gunaratna said. \"It is now imperative for governments to screen all passengers passing through their land borders, sea ports and their airports against the Interpol database.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

The belief is that humans should be rounded so they are harmonious and 'neutral' and there's less friction,\" she explains.\n\nThe bronze figures are created with smooth surfaces, and they're either hanging upside down from a tree branch, or seated, Buddha style, on a cloud. \"I created them to look naive and as simple as possible. Because I'm not a terribly clever person . . . I believe that one should look for simplicity in life,\" shares the 37-year-old Hunan-born artist, who's best known for her smooth works fashioned out of bronze and synthetic material.\n\nZhang Jian Long, meanwhile, has infused his children figures with human expressions, often modelling the emotions himself when he imagines himself performing the very act he's trying to depict. Zhang has his children playing hoops in the sand, or fishing, or simply tumbling about. It harks back to his own happy childhood days, he says, in the 1980s.\n\nHe grew up in Xibei, in Gansu province, and often travelled to the countryside. If his characters sometimes look like they've stepped out of a Chinese folktale book, he agrees that it's because he's trying to recapture some old stories and beliefs. \"These have often been forgotten in China's rapid growth - the original culture,\" adds the 32-year-old.\n\nThe duo gave a sculpting class to children from the Little Performing Arts Academy this week, as part of their exhibition in Singapore.\n\n\"And what we told them is to do what they want to do, and what they feel,\" says Xie.\n\nZhang pips in: \"We don't want to tell them what to do. It's more important that they tell us what they want to share, and we can help them express it.\"\n\n'Nature at Play' will be on exhibit at Ion Art Gallery, Level 4, Ion Orchard, until March 30.

By Debbie Yong\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Mar 28, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWHEN Sang-Hoon Degeimbre got his first job in the restaurant industry close to two decades ago, he already had his sights on running his own restaurant some day. Never mind that the Korean-born Belgian chef - now with two Michelin-starred L'Air du Temps to his name - was just a novice waiter then, or that he knew nothing about cooking.\n\nHe set about doing what every young aspiring culinarian would do: learn. \"I'm a very curious person and I wanted to know more - not just put plates on the table. I saw wine as a really rich topic, so I began to taste and learn what I could,\" the 44-year-old recalls during an interview at The White Rabbit this week, where he is cooking as a guest chef for this year's World Gourmet Summit.\n\nBut he didn't just stop there. After progressing to the rank of wine director, he chalked up further resume accolades such as stints in Belgium's leading restaurants such as La Truffe Noire and Petit Versailles as well as topping a competition to emerge as Belgian's second best sommelier. But even then, his yearning to be in the kitchen burned. \"Nobody wanted to hire me in the kitchen because I had no experience,\" he shrugs, laughing. \"So I opened my own.\"\n\nIn 1997, he forked out 75,000 euros (S$129,918) to set up L'Air du Temps, then a petite 20-seater \"in a small house by the road\", he recalls, building everything by himself, even the toilet. As a first-time chef, he drew inspiration from what he knew best then: wine. His very first creation, he remembers, was John Dory cooked with various ingredients to recreate the rich butter, hazelnut and coffee aromas of Burgundy wine. \"Wine is a topic that got me to learn about geography, geology and chemistry - it was the first step to becoming a chef,\" he elaborates.\n\nStill, he knew that without formal kitchen training, he had to further hone his cooking techniques, which he did by delving into the chemical and physical reactions that lay behind cooking processes - or molecular gastronomy, as the field of study is better known - together with good friend and French chemist Herv\u00e9 This.\n\nHe later went on to partner Belgian food research company Sense for Taste to start foodpairing.com, an online database that chefs can use to pair ingredients according to their basic flavour profiles on a molecular level.\n\nBut it's not all about technicalities. \"The best techniques are those you can't see,\" he says. \"To create a good dish, you need three elements: product, technique and emotion.\"\n\nWhich is why his dishes are created to unfold like a mise-en-scene of a movie, designed to strike a chord, such as by provoking childhood memories.\n\nInspired by his childhood spent truffle hunting, for instance, a signature dish christened \"truffles under the snow\" comprises mussels and truffle shavings hidden under a pot of edible \"snow\" that diners have to shovel through. But perhaps the emotional element comes through most strikingly in his embracing of his Korean roots. Adopted with his younger brother by Belgian parents when he was five, chef Degeimbre made his first trip back to South Korea five years ago, on the invitation of the South Korean government as they wanted his advice on globalising Korean cuisine.\n\n\"I had some chicken jiigae (chicken stew), and recognised its smell immediately, it was so familiar to me,\" says the chef, who now returns to South Korea yearly to attend food festivals or to learn new dishes and cooking techniques. These days, he doesn't travel without a bottle of jang - fermented soybean paste - in his suitcase. \"It's the Korean version of umami, I add a drop of it to everything and it makes such a different. Jang is the taste of Korea,\" he states.\n\nYou see what he means in his rendition of his favourite Korean dish, the bo ssam, in which boiled pork belly and oysters are eaten wrapped in cabbage. In chef Degeimbre's version, cabbage, oyster leaf, an oyster and dots of pumpkin and yuzu puree sit elegantly on a strip of pork belly. A touch of gochujang, or hot pepper paste, holds it all together. \"It's like being a painter, you progress in different stages. Returning to my Korean roots and native flavours is like getting more colour and texture to paint with,\" he says. \"I am now more complete.\"\n\nFittingly, art - and Belgian artists in particular - are a big influence in his creations. A touch of Pierre Alechinsky's monochrome leanings can be seen in chef Degeimbre's chimera or man-made \"octopus egg\" that contrasts white squid flesh against a sooty squid ink filling. The mackerel Jackson Pollock, meanwhile, is a slab of fish served with brightly coloured sauces, which diners can use to \"paint\" their own Pollock-inspired impressions on the plate.\n\nKorean fermentation techniques, too, are something he banks on to preserve excess produce from his garden for use through the winter months. On its 15th anniversary last year, the restaurant relocated to much larger premises in \u00c9ghez\u00e9e, half an hour outside of Brussels. The 50-seater dining room is now surrounded by a 2ha garden that holds more than 400 kinds of vegetables, including Asian ones such as ginger, zucchini from Vietnam and shiso leaves from South Korea. As the garden produces an excess yield every summer and fall season, vegetables consequently find their way onto his dessert plates too.\n\nOne such dish showcased at The White Rabbit seamlessly folds in carrot, white chocolate and a delicate sorbet of violet flowers, but don't be surprised to find the latter made from beetroot or even celeriac or fennel at L'Air du Temps. Sustainability and a return to doing everything by hand, after all, is a movement he predicts will be the driving force for chefs this year. \"Before poor countries got rich, everyone had a garden which was their treasure, and it was something they cared for to keep for a long time. We've forgotten all these techniques because it's much easier to buy these vegetables in the market,\" he says. \"It's nice to revive some of these memories.\"\n\nAnd so much the richer we are for realising it.\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\nQuail Egg in a Potato Nest\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 large potato\n\nA little melted butter\n\n2 teaspoons cornstarch\n\n12 fresh quail's eggs\n\n6g black garlic\n\n100g grapeseed oil\n\n15g black garlic vinegar\n\n125g egg white\n\n1.4g salt\n\n6 shiitake mushrooms\n\nMethod:\n\nSteam the shiitake mushrooms for 10 minutes. Take them out, dry them and put in an 80C oven for two hours, or until they are dried out. Blend them into a powder.\n\nUsing a spiralizer, cut the potatoes into long strips. Wash the strips to remove the potato starch. Lightly brush a silicone mold with melted butter. Dust the potato strips with cornstarch and arrange them into a nest inside the silicone mold. Press another buttered silicone mold into the top to keep its shape. Deep-fry the potato along with the molds in 150C oil until golden brown.\n\nBoil the quail's eggs for 2 mins 10 secs, and immediately dunk into a ice water bath. Transfer to a bowl of white vinegar to dissolve the shells. Carefully peel off the membrane, and set aside.\n\nUsing a handheld blender, blend the garlic, grapeseed oil, black garlic vinegar, egg white and salt together until it emulsifies.\n\nTo assemble, place the potato nest on a plate. Pipe a little black garlic sauce on, and top with a quail's egg. Dust with the shiitake powder.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There is a risk there which you will find difficult to reduce to zero,\" he noted.\n\nStill, Singapore has a vested interest in understanding nuclear power because neighbouring countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam are likely to be interested in it as an option and possibly include it as one element of their energy mix.\n\nThis is because they want to diversify away from oil as their overall energy needs are growing, he said.\n\nEach of them, however, will have to abide by international standards laid down by the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\nThe Vienna-based organisation has been advising countries in South-east Asia and guiding them on how to get prepared when it comes to nuclear energy, and what sort of pace would be considered reasonable.\n\nThe citizens of these countries, too, will want the assurance that the proper safeguards are in place first, said Mr Lee.\n\nOn Singapore's part, the Prime Minister said that there was already an ongoing effort to build up the country's expertise in this area.\n\n\"(Singapore) needs to have some understanding of (nuclear safety), so that in case anything happens anywhere in the region, we have some expertise to fall back on,\" he said.\n\n\"This is something that we are building up gradually in the universities and in our research institutes - some basic capabilities to understand, to assess, and to advise the government what the options are, what the dangers are, and what to do in a situation.\"\n\nThe NSS is the brainchild of United States President Barack Obama, who urged world leaders at the close of the summit to work closer together to stop nuclear terrorism.\n\nThe next NSS will be held in the US in 2016. Mr Obama said that this summit would be a \"transition\" one where leaders will look to hand responsibility for nuclear security to their officials.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The annual property survey is usually conducted at the beginning of the year as a reference for government policies and isn't made public.\n\n\"This shows that the government has realised the risks in smaller Chinese cities, and expanding to more cities will help them know better about the market,\" said Liu Yuan, a Shanghai-based researcher at Centaline Property Agency Ltd, China's biggest real estate brokerage. \"The government wants to know how some markets have been affected, while it had been concerned about overheating in previous years.\"\n\nHome prices and sales have weakened this year and developers in some cities have started to cut prices, the NDRC said in the notices, according to the officials. As part of the survey, the NDRC is also seeking advice from developers about property policies, the people said. Local governments are required to submit the survey results by April 10, they said.\n\nChina had 333 prefecture-level cities and four municipalities by the end of 2012, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. Prefecture-level cities generally have a non-farming population of at least 250,000, according to the government. Officials at the NDRC's media department didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nChina's home sales fell 5 per cent in the first two months of the year from the same period last year, while fewer cities showed gains in home prices last month among the 70 that the statistics bureau tracks.\n\n\"In recent months the property sector has come under clear stress, with rapidly falling sales and investment and falling property prices in many regions,\" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a March 21 research report. \"Now we see more room as well as the need to adjust property policy.\"\n\nThe collapse of Zhejiang Xingrun Real Estate Co this month fuelled concerns that debt could overwhelm more developers. The government of Fenghua, where Xingrun is based, said on March 19 it met officials from six lenders to discuss the company's debt.\n\nFollowing the weakening of home sales and the collapse, two Chinese developers received regulatory approval for new-stock sales earlier this month, the first the government has allowed by real estate companies in about four years. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

This will be implemented in Asian markets that include Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Thailand.\n\nThe two partners will also explore additional opportunities to collaborate beyond the 11 Asian markets that are covered by the agreement, and in Africa.\n\nPrudential Singapore also announced that its new business sales hit a record $706 million last year, up 18 per cent from the preceding year. The growth was boosted by contributions from bancassurance channels, said Tomas Urbanec, CEO of Prudential Singapore.\n\nBesides selling products through agents, Prudential Singapore has its products distributed at branches of Standard Chartered, UOB, Maybank and SingPost.\n\n\"A lot of people are interested in talking to us,\" said Mr Urbanec, referring to the use of bancassurance channels.\n\nUnder these partnerships, potential customers will be offered the full suite of products available from Prudential Singapore, but banks can offer more targeted sales of certain products that align with their specific customer base, he added.\n\nThe growth last year was boosted by the strong sale of investment products to high net worth individuals, said Mr Urbanec, with some of these products sold to banks' priority customers, and private-bank clients.\n\nThe segment of customers over 40 years old represents the fastest-growing segment in terms of customer acquisition, as Singaporeans seek out products with investment returns and protection benefits, he added.\n\nPrudential Singapore is also seeing strong demand for its Shield products. These are insurance plans that raise the coverage provided by MediShield, which only covers hospitalisation up to certain ward classes at public hospitals.\n\nThe government is looking at more enhancements to MediShield with the new MediShield Life plan, which will raise premiums. Prudential Singapore is one of five providers of these integrated Shield plans.\n\n\"We've seen no numbers,\" said Mr Urbanec, referring to the higher premiums in the offing.\n\nHe added that proposed regulations for the insurance business in Singapore would prompt insurers to present information in a clear and transparent way.\n\nUnder the Financial Advisory Industry Review, or Fair, regulators plan to introduce an aggregator for consumers to compare life insurance products.\n\nIt also plans to provide a remuneration framework for agents, to keep agents' incentives in line with the interests of customers.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The tenant's lease ends in September 2015.\n\nThe indicative price for the property, which is zoned for commercial use, is in the region of $28 million, said Cushman & Wakefield and Historical Land, the joint marketing agents for the property.\n\nLocated along Sultan Gate off Beach Road, the property sits on a land area of about 7,401 sq ft and is flanked by a public car park and a side lane. It is designated for conservation under the Kampong Glam conservation area.\n\nThe indicative price is a \"very palatable investment quantum\" to acquire a detached block of conservation shophouses with such a rich heritage, said Shaun Poh, executive director of Capital Markets at Cushman & Wakefield.\n\n\"Despite the current overall market slowdown as a result of the cooling measures, conservation of commercial shophouses remains an attractive investment option in view of the limited supply and have also proven to be a highly resilient property class,\" said Mr Poh. The expression of interest for the subject property will close at 3pm on April 23.\n\nThree adjoining plots of Good Class Bungalow (GCB) land located along Holland Rise and East Sussex Lane were also put up for sale by Cushman & Wakefield. The three plots are vacant and sit on a regular-shaped land totalling 52,992 sq ft.\n\nPlot 1 is 17,422 sq ft; Plot 2 is 18,176 sq ft and Plot 3 is 17,393 sq ft. The indicative price for the plots, which can be sold together or separately, is about $1,500 per square foot (psf).\n\nThey are accessible via two cul-de-sacs at Holland Rise and East Sussex Lane. The site is within walking distance of Holland Village and Holland Village MRT Station.\n\nSince the start of the year, sales activities in the GCB market have recorded transactions ranging from $1,401 psf over a land area of 20,344 sq ft for a GCB at Old Holland Road and $1,976 psf over a land area of 15,177 sq ft at Cluny Hill, said Mr Poh.\n\n\"Opportunities to acquire large-sized adjoining GCB land plots such as this are very rare in land-scarce Singapore. GCBs have proven to be a highly resilient property class over time and even the current overall market slowdown as a result of the cooling measures have at best only moderated price growth in the GCB market,\" he added.\n\nThe expression of interest for the property will close at 3pm on April 24.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/cutting-utilities-costs-and-carbon-emissions", "site_title": "Cutting utilities costs and carbon emissions", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nCutting utilities costs and carbon emissions\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Mar 26, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nRECENT news of in-house co-generation plant projects, both planned and underway, by oil refining/petrochemical players such as energy giant ExxonMobil and PetroChina/Chevron-owned Singapore Refining Company speaks volumes of the significance of utilities in their operations here. But it is not the reliability of power or steam supplies here which is in question. Rather, it is their relatively high costs - compared with those of more energy-blessed countries - that is bugging investors from Germany's Lanxess, Shell and Finland's Neste Oil to the many other Japanese players here.\n\nOne major plus of having in-house cogen plants is that they provide the refining/petrochemical complexes with utilities on-tap. Depending on operational needs, they also have the option to sell any excess power that they produce to the main electricity grid. Hyflux, for instance, is building a 411 MW cogen plant to power its Tuaspring plant, but expects to export some 300 MW to the grid. While accounting for a mere drop in the total electricity pool here, such supplementary supplies can help to keep power prices stable.\n\nBut smaller industry players may not have the capital, economies of scale or capability to have in-house cogen plants, although there are pharmaceutical companies in Tuas which have invested in smaller tri-generation units. The government however, has recognised that high utilities costs is an issue for the industry and is addressing this. While still early days, the Economic Development Board is developing a \"heat integration\" plan for plants on Jurong Island to share any excess heat or steam that they generate during their operations, with government playing an \"honest broker\" role in case of proprietary concerns by some companies about sharing and piping the steam or heat across fences.\n\nOn the broader front, Singapore is also facilitating a range of utilities options from biomass/coal plants to energy-from-waste generation to try to help stabilise utilities costs, with these projects enabling testing of new solutions for cheaper and greener energy at the same time. The new LNG terminal has also allowed Singapore to diversify its gas supplies beyond those piped from Indonesia and Malaysia, with this lowering the risk of unexpected price fluctuations and the impact of supply disruptions. The availability of liquefied natural gas has also spurred new genco plantings, with the resultant spike in generation capacity here starting to exert downward pressure on wholesale electricity prices.\n\nCost-reduction aside, both the power companies as well as the refinery/petrochemical players recognise that their investments in gas-fired cogen plants improve the energy efficiency of their operations as well as reduce their greenhouse gas emissions at the same time. The latter is critical for the sector here which has been red-flagged for being pollutive, and which needs to act on this before there is a crackdown.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its 64 mansions will have cellars stocked with first-growth Bordeaux, gold-plated shower heads and commanding views of emerald polo grounds, Mr Pan says.\n\nAnchored by the Tianjin Goldin Metropolitan Polo Club, the villas are part of a US$5 billion, 89-hectare development that's expected to include a 117-storey office tower that has risen to almost half its planned height, an upscale shopping mall, a Las Vegas-style theatre, a convention centre and dozens of apartment blocks, four of which are nearly sold out.\n\n\"I'm not satisfied with three Michelin stars or Robert Parker's 100 points,\" Mr Pan says. \"We want to put everything that is high-end into one community, where horses are front and centre.\"\n\nChina is minting more millionaires than any other emerging economy, according to the 2013 Asia-Pacific Wealth Report from Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management, which puts their ranks at 643,000, up 14.3 per cent from 2012.\n\nProperty developers in China have been building pricey villas overlooking golf courses for decades; now, by replacing fairways with the Kentucky bluegrass of polo fields, Mr Pan is introducing the country's nouveaux riches to a whole new level of turnkey sophistication.\n\n\"He has a certain savoir-faire that differentiates him from people who have only money,\" says Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges, chief executive officer of the Hong Kong Jockey Club. \"He wants to create an experience that is not only a property but a lifestyle.\"\n\nIt's a lifestyle that's part Donald Trump, part British aristocracy. Mr Pan's Gulfstream G550 jets him to homes in Hong Kong, London, Los Angeles and Tianjin, where he's building a 6,500 square metre mansion that's bigger than Candyland, the late Aaron Spelling's former 5,100 sq m house in LA. And he hobnobs with princes Harry and William at a charity polo match he sponsors at England's exclusive Beaufort Polo Club each June.\n\nThe furnishings headed for his Tianjin manse may be faux Louis XV, but the polo club it overlooks is the real deal. \"The general facilities are outstanding, and not many sporting clubs in the world are more elegant,\" said Richard Caleel, president of the Federation of International Polo. It's stocked with more than 200 top-of-the-line ponies from Argentina and Australia, and each January, the club stages the Snow Polo World Cup, which fields top international teams.\n\nAt last year's event, Mr Pan flew in opera singers from Buenos Aires, offered a course called \"Deconstructing Molecular Gastronomy\" and treated guests to a tasting of wines from Chateau Haut-Brion, one of only five Bordeaux estates with the top premier cru classification.\n\nAs Chinese President Xi Jinping's crackdown on corruption enters its second year, conspicuous consumption of Patek Philippe watches and Louis Vuitton handbags is still frowned upon, something that makes Mr Pan's offering of a discreet lifestyle behind closed doors appealing.\n\n\"People are moving towards a less ostentatious display of wealth,\" says Michael Klibaner, regional head of research at real estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle in Hong Kong.\n\nThough Mr Klibaner finds the idea of a polo club \"a bit gimmicky\", he says that it's a smart alternative at a time when China has imposed a ban on building any more golf courses.\n\nWilliam Lin, a Tianjin-based Internet entrepreneur and the first Chinese member to take up polo at the club, says that the limited popularity of the game isn't the point.\n\n\"Most people who buy apartments here won't play, but will like a lifestyle where they can watch out the window,\" he says. \"As the Chinese make more money, they will need to know which kind of high-class lifestyle they should follow.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

It is one of the oldest surviving ceremonies still in existence today.\n\nIn a speech that he was expected to deliver during a dinner last night after receiving the award, Mr Lee said that he was \"deeply honoured and yet humbled\" as he dedicated it to the people of Singapore who have worked hard to build the country into what it is today.\n\nMr Lee is in London for a four-day visit, the third and final stop of his week-long trip to Europe. He arrived here on Wednesday night after a short stay in Luxembourg.\n\n\"Special credit must go to our pioneer generation, who dreamt of a far better Singapore when we became independent, and took us a long way along the journey there,\" he said during the dinner held at Mansion House, the home and office of London Lord Mayor Fiona Woolf.\n\n\"This award also reflects the long and close friendship between London and Singapore and between our peoples. I am therefore happy that my colleagues and friends are here to share this occasion with me,\" he told his audience that included his wife Ho Ching.\n\nAmong the 75 people at the dinner were Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean and his wife, and Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Grace Fu. Some of Mr Lee's former tutors from Cambridge University, where he was a student in the 1970s, were also present.\n\nEarlier in the day, Mr Lee, who is visiting London for the first time since 2009, called on British Prime Minister David Cameron at 10 Downing Street.\n\nJust as he did during his earlier meetings with the leaders of Germany, Denmark and Luxembourg, Mr Lee sought Mr Cameron's support for the early ratification of the European Union-Singapore free trade agreement.\n\nMr Lee also had a closed-door lunch with a group of business leaders, including the chiefs of multinational firms such as Prudential, Standard Chartered Bank, Barclays, BP and Rolls-Royce.\n\nLater today, the prime minister's packed itinerary will see him attend a number of functions throughout the day, capped off by a reception to mark the opening of Temasek Holdings' new office in London.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth/wealth-investing/riding-crest-megatrends", "site_title": "Riding on crest of megatrends", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nRiding on crest of megatrends\n\nPictet Asset Management banks on the long-term payoffs of theme funds, reports GENEVIEVE CUA\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Mar 25, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nINVESTORS have been burnt investing in theme funds through the years, but Pictet Asset Management believes a thematic approach is relevant and rewarding in the long term.\n\nInvestors representing US$20 billion in assets agree; this is the amount to date invested in Pictet's stable of thematic funds, most of which have outperformed the MSCI World index since their inception dates. The largest and most established theme fund is the Pictet Water fund, which has more than US$4 billion in assets and a strong track record.\n\nPictet Asset Management manages about US$150 billion. While many managers take an opportunistic view of thematic investments - launching funds with themes they reckon will be able to attract assets quickly - Pictet takes a systematic approach with an eye to megatrends that are powerful and sustainable.\n\nMegatrends, said Alexander Mouthon, Pictet Asset Management's senior client portfolio manager (sector and theme funds team), \"represent powerful forces and trends that reshape the world\".\n\n\"They lead to profound changes in terms of social, environmental and political issues. These trends are attractive from the investment point of view because they are long lasting.'' Working with the Copenhagen Institute for Future Studies, the firm has identified more than a dozen megatrends. These include globalisation, which refers to the increasingly global connections between people, capital and products, among others.\n\nA second megatrend is polarisation, which is the tendency for extremes to grow at the expense of the middle ground. There is also demography, which refers to a widening divide between countries with a younger workforce and those with an ageing and shrinking workforce. Economic growth is also seen as a megatrend; it refers to an increase in the world's capacity to produce goods and services.\n\nAn investible theme must tap into a number of megatrends - the greater the number, the more feasible the strategy. The Water fund, for example, taps into five themes, including health, economic growth and demographic trends. The Premium Brands fund, which invests in luxury brands, also taps into six megatrends, including economic growth, globalisation and polarisation.\n\nMr Mouthon says: \"Thematic investing allows investors to think in a much different way than they do so far with more traditional ways of investing money. It's fully unconstrained. We don't look at benchmarks and are not constrained by sector, region or market capitalisation. We simply try to identify companies around the world that best fit the themes - we try to identify companies in the small and mid-cap areas that may be the winners tomorrow.''\n\nThere are nine thematic funds in the stable. For those who would like to tiptoe into the strategies but are unsure which ones to back, there is also the Global Megatrend Selection, which offers an equally weighted exposure to all nine themes.\n\nIn terms of underlying holdings, the individual themes offer a low degree of overlap with the MSCI World ranging from 0.2 per cent to 8 per cent. The latter is the overlap that exists for the Digital Communications fund.\n\nMost strategies have fared better than the MSCI World index based on returns since their respective inception dates. The Water fund, for example, has generated an annualised return of 5.08 per cent since inception in 2000 to end-February, against the MSCI World's 0.74 per cent. The Premium Brands fund has returned 9 per cent annualised since 2005 compared to MSCI World's 5.3 per cent. Some exceptions are the Clean Energy fund, which is being repositioned, and Agriculture, which has suffered a bear market in commodity prices.\n\nMr Mouthon said a long-term view helps to generate excess returns. \"We try to identify companies with superior growth rates over the long term and are mispriced by the market. Most analysts build valuation models for the next three to five years. Over five years, their assumption may be that growth would fade. If you base your research on megatrends that are long-term in nature, and figure out the long-term growth rate, usually the conclusion - at least for our companies - is that growth would not fade, that the companies would grow at a sustainable rate. That's why there is undervaluation and mispricing . . . We focus on valuation because we don't want to overpay for growth.''\n\nWhat if a trend changes or fizzles out? Mr Mouthon said the firm's advisory board monitors the themes to see that they remain valid. A theme fund may be repositioned. The Clean Energy Fund is an example. The emergence of low-cost competitors in Asia has reduced the profitability of renewable energy companies. Slower growth in Europe has also cut the public funds available for environmentally friendly energy policies. The fund is now focusing on the sub-themes of natural gas and energy efficiency. Exposure to the latter is 64 per cent, compared with 18 per cent at end-2007. Exposure to renewable energy infrastructure has been cut from 75 per cent in 2007 to around 10 per cent.\n\ngen@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

When AirAsia boss Tony Fernandes first teamed up with well-connected Indians such as the Tatas and millionaire realtor Arun Bhatia over a year ago to create AA-India, his plan was met with unyielding resistance.\n\nExisting Indian airlines feared that the carrier's well-known business model of undercutting everyone in sight while keeping its costs low would cause a number to go out of business. As at end-September 2013, Indian aviation market statistics indicated that the combined losses of all Indian airlines were around US$500 million.\n\nMr Fernandes did not help matters by enthusiastically promising that AA-India would offer \"dramatically lower fares\". The airlines went to court.\n\nThe litigation isn't quite settled yet but New Delhi seems quite clear in what it wants. In February, the director general of civil aviation dismissed a collective objection by private Indian airlines to the licence for AA-India.\n\nThe airlines had argued that a September 2012 policy allowing foreign airlines to invest in local ones was applicable only to existing airlines and not new entrants.\n\nA three-member committee to examine the objections concluded that it found \"no reason to put on hold the processing of the application of AirAsia India for issuance of an Air Operator Permit\".\n\nMore tellingly, the panel also held that the rapid growth of the Indian civil aviation sector presented \"a strong need\" to facilitate air traffic by encouraging the existing airlines as well as allowing new entrants so that Indian travellers could avail themselves of optimum services at reasonably affordable tariffs.\n\nThe move into the Indian market is part of Mr Fernandes' ambitious business model for his carrier, now Asia's largest low-cost airline by load. It has been a model that has changed as times have changed.\n\nStarting from the Malaysian market and spreading to the rest of the region via AA units in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, betting on the region, Mr Fernandes relocated to Jakarta in 2010 in the hope of making the Indonesian capital AA's Asean base. But the results have been mixed: only Thai-AA has been profitable while the other two units are nearly there.\n\nMeanwhile, intensifying competition in Malaysia and the rest of the region led to a change of heart. Realising that Malaysia was the carrier's largest market and the linchpin of its earnings, Mr Fernandes moved back to Kuala Lumpur. AA scaled down its operations in Jakarta, and has aimed its sights at completely dominating the Malaysian market with further cost cuts and new frequencies.\n\nAt the same time, Mr Fernandes has sought to leverage his assets in the rest of the region with the feeder services from AirAsia X, AA's medium-haul budget carrier, to increase connectivity to Asia.\n\nIndia is the next puzzle in AA's business jigsaw, analysts say. \"The Indian market is estimated to top 400 million passengers by 2020,\" said an aviation analyst at a foreign research house in Kuala Lumpur. \"Tony thinks he can fit right in with a low-cost base like Chennai.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However, aircraft landings and take-offs were up 3.2 per cent at 26,764.\n\nThe decrease in February's passenger traffic could be partly due to seasonal factors, since Chinese New Year was in February last year.\n\n\"The Lunar New Year holidays this year started in late January, 10 days earlier than in 2013,\" said CAG in a statement.\n\nPassenger traffic to Bangkok declined by as much as 29 per cent last month as the ongoing protests in the troubled capital city dampened travel demand. Carriers such as Singapore Airlines (SIA) have been cutting flights to Bangkok in response to the softer demand.\n\nTraffic to the Americas also continued to feel the impact of the cessation of SIA's non-stop flights to New York and Los Angeles, which it stopped operating late last year as the carrier struggled with the high fuel costs and flagging demand associated with the non-stop flights.\n\nHowever, the slackening in other markets was offset by a rise in passenger traffic to markets such as North-east Asia, South-east Asia and South Asia, CAG said. Popular travel destinations which racked up double-digit traffic growth in February include Bali and Kuala Lumpur.\n\nFor the first two months of the year, Changi saw 8.7 million passengers passing through the airport, up 3.1 per cent year-on-year, while air freight edged up 0.8 per cent to 279,057 tonnes. Aircraft landings and take-offs increased 5.5 per cent to 57,117.\n\nLast year, Changi handled a record 53.7 million passengers, a 5 per cent increase over 2012. This year, Changi is projecting a growth rate of 3-5 per cent in passenger throughput, citing base effects and macroeconomic conditions.\n\nMore than 100 airlines operate at Changi, linking Singapore to 280 cities in about 60 countries and territories worldwide.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Of the 38 units, 30 are located in the tower block and face Goodwood Hill.\n\nThe development comprises a total of 133 units. Completed in the 1980s, the 34-storey development was one of the tallest condominium buildings then. It is located along Draycott Park and next to Ardmore Park.\n\nFrom an en bloc perspective, an investor who pays, for example, $200 million for the 38 units would indirectly be buying into the redevelopment potential for the land at the rate of around $1,790 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr), said JLL.\n\nBy comparison, Hampton Court, also located along Draycott Park, was sold to Swire Group at about $2,526 psf ppr in December 2012. Westwood Apartments was also sold at a similar rate in 2007 in an en bloc sale. These two examples point to an attractive 40 per cent arbitrage potential if an en bloc sale is timed propitiously, said JLL.\n\nThe portfolio's valuation of $1,900 psf also offers a discount when compared with individual sales of other projects in the vicinity. Three units at the nearby Ardmore Park were sold at an average of $3,490 psf in the second half of last year while a low floor unit at Four Seasons Park was recently transacted at $2,323 psf.\n\n\"The market is experiencing a low point now, with the cumulative weight of the suppressive measures at its peak, especially with foreigners needing to pay 18 per cent stamp duty. As a result, prices of high-end homes around Orchard Road have eased as much as 15 to 25 per cent from the high in 2007,\" said Karamjit Singh, head of investments and residential at JLL.\n\n\"Astute long-term investors who believe in market cycles would find this a timely investment. When the market for high-end homes recovers, possibly in the medium term, an en bloc sale along with the other owners of The Draycott would be an ideal exit strategy.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These negotiations, too, are likely to last a long time before a final deal is reached.\n\nAccording to latest figures, air traffic between the EU and Asean nearly doubled over the last 15 years to reach more than 10 million passengers in 2012.\n\nThe EU-Asean air transport market has a combined population of 1.1 billion and is expected to grow at an average rate of 5 per cent a year over the next two decades.\n\nMr Lee, who was visiting Luxembourg for the first time, also thanked Mr Bettel for his support for the early ratification of the EU-Singapore free trade agreement (FTA).\n\nThis FTA, the first between the EU and a Southeast Asian country, is a \"strategic commitment\" by Europe that it will stay open for business with Asia, said Mr Lee.\n\nThe FTA will benefit Luxembourg companies as they will enjoy perks such as immediate duty-free access for all imports from the EU and Luxembourg, he added.\n\nThe many Luxembourgish companies already operating in Singapore, including all-cargo airline Cargolux, can tap a larger pool of suppliers in the region through Singapore, said Mr Lee.\n\nBilateral trade between Singapore and Luxembourg grew more than 60 per cent last year. Luxembourg was the Republic's third-largest EU investor and 12th biggest globally, with total foreign direct investment stock estimated at $21.7 billion as at the end of 2012.\n\nIt was a whirlwind visit for Mr Lee as he spent about eight hours in the city, after taking a 40-minute flight from The Hague where he had attended the Nuclear Security Summit.\n\nAfter his meeting and lunch with Mr Bettel, Mr Lee and his delegation met Luxembourg's other senior figures including Grand Duke Henri, the current head of state, and former prime minister Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\nMr Lee also extended an invitation to Mr Bettel to visit Singapore soon, which the Luxembourg leader accepted.\n\n\"(Mr Bettel) told me he was last in Singapore three years ago and enjoyed the skyline from the Marina Bay Sands. The next time he comes, I think the skyline will be somewhat improved,\" said Mr Lee to laughter from his host.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These sanctions may be expanded to target specific areas of the economy, including financial services, energy, metals and mining. The international community's immediate priorities should be to calm the situation in Ukraine and send a strong signal to President Vladimir Putin that will deter him from expanding his plans to the rest of Ukraine and other eastern European countries, if indeed there are such plans. Economic sanctions, even if morally justified, may not be as effective in achieving these aims as the international community may hope.\n\nFor one thing, while economic sanctions may hurt a country's economy and damage its links to the global financial and business networks, history has proved that autocratic governments can still stubbornly ride through these sanctions for decades - Libya (for more than 20 years), North Korea (for over six decades) and Myanmar (for more than 20 years) offersuch examples. If these developing countries could survive sanctions, then there is little reason why an economically and geopolitically powerful Russia would not. Washington frequently cites Iran as a successful and recent example of why the economic sanctions tool should not be abandoned to achieve political aims. But there are stark differences between Iran and Russia, which casts doubts on whether sanctions can be used as a blanket policy against all perceived \"rogue\" or \"internationally divergent\" countries.\n\nUnlike Iran, and even Myanmar, which were not as plugged into the global economy, Russia is very much integrated. As such, it may be difficult to isolate it economically, without damage to an already weak global economy. Europe, in particular, has deep and extensive economic links with Russia, particularly within the energy sector. Europe needs Russia as a major source of energy and minerals as much as Russia needs Europe as a market. Unless the US can replace the Russians in this equation, which seems a far-fetched possibility at least in the short term, economic sanctions against Russia's energy supply could be a bitter pill for an ailing European economy to swallow. Other eastern European countries which also have dense trade links with Russia will also feel the pain of any economic sanctions applied on Moscow.\n\nWith the billions of roubles from Russia's oligarchs flowing into many of Europe's economies, the European Union (EU) could be more innovative and look beyond just sanctions. The immediate priority should be to encourage the formation of a legitimate government in Ukraine. While deposed president Viktor Yanukovych was deeply, and appropriately, unpopular, the fact that the current group of self-appointed politicians in charge lacks legitimacy cannot be ignored. After a legitimate government is in place in Kiev, the EU can work on accelerating Ukraine's accession. That would send a far stronger signal to Mr Putin and give him more to worry about than economic sanctions.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The bank upgraded its emerging market (EM) equity and 10-year government bond allocation from zero per cent at end-2013 to 5 per cent, each.\n\nIn a second quarter asset allocation report released yesterday, SocGen, which called for caution on EM assets as early as March 2011, said that the assets have \"switched from 'priced for perfection' to value or even deep value\". \"We believe a lot of bad news is now already priced in. Therefore, we recommend rebuilding some exposure,\" it said.\n\nEmerging markets enjoyed a decade of strong gains from 1999 to 2009, and recovered quickly after the financial crisis. They have suffered from massive outflows since last May, when fears of rising US yields and slowing China growth caused investors to flee back to the developed world. This time, SocGen is not calling for an overweight on EM. In fact, it remains underweight EM equities, and neutral on EM government bonds.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Companies & Markets\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nMalaysia has not found any evidence yet of illicit chip smuggling, minister says\n\nJul 15, 2025 01:43 PM\n\nNvidia to resume H20 AI chip sales to China in US reversal\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nIndonesia looking at levy on coal exports to boost state coffers\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:03 PM\n\nAsia: Markets mixed as China\u2019s economy meets forecasts\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:49 AM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n4\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\n5\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal", "images": []}

When he joined the company two years ago, it was at 2,000 employees. Today, it's reaching 4,000 and he expects Akamai to cross 5,000 by next year.\n\nAkamai is the world's largest content delivery network provider, whose services are employed by the likes of TV stations and video game companies in order to make high-end applications such as streaming video run faster to the end-user. The company estimates that about 30 per cent of the world's Internet traffic flows through its network of globally distributed servers.\n\nMr Termotto said that the global spread of employees makes data-keeping an even more important part of management.\n\nThe company splits its management into three broad regions: EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), the US, and the Asia-Pacific and Japan.\n\n\"We're hiring in different regions, and we move people across them all the time. When I look at who to hire, I'm looking down a runway of the next three to five years. It's not just about who to hire tomorrow,\" he said.\n\nAnd this role is tougher today because of the increasing talent crunch in the technology sector.\n\n\"(All the tech firms) are fighting for the same skillsets, from cloud to software-as-a-service,\" he noted.\n\nAs the market improves, more jobs open up, and large firms are competing for the same talent pool. Once employees are in the door, the HR department's job doesn't stop there. The company uses a mix of in-house and off-the-shelf products to track employees through their lifetime with the company, from training to job responsibilities.\n\nIt's also got to ensure that employees are happy - a metric that is hard to place on a spreadsheet.\n\nBut this \"happiness\" can be placed on a graph, in a way. Upon joining, an employee's data, such as previous salary and job function, are captured. That can be placed onto custom models that Akamai's performance management system has created, which churn out expected success factors and outcomes.\n\nAs the employee progresses through the company, that model points out action plans that managers can execute with the staff to get them to where they want to be, explained Mr Termotto. Diligent data-gathering is just part of the equation - the trick is connecting those datasets to discover something about the employees, he said.\n\nHo Chee Tiong, sales and operations director of Unit4's HR software division, said that the company was experiencing demand for HR products because the price for analytics software has come down.\n\nMoreover, companies are also tracking more data, thanks to mobile technologies and social-based interactions. These include the gradual migration to Web-based applications for employees on the go, and more reporting that can be logged from messenger applications, for instance.\n\nHR departments have long tracked metrics such as turnover ratios and employee engagement levels. All the additional data coming in spells the opportunity to come up with more metrics with which to benchmark staff, he said.\n\nThese include the average timeframe for promotions, or the percentage of top candidates to be hired within the organisation.\n\nHe said that out-of-the-box templates can be fired up and working with the business within a few months, and that companies with longer plans in sight should carry out their customisations in phased upgrades.\n\nMr Termotto admitted that Akamai is spending more on its HR tools, as the need to customise them goes up. But this is in tandem with the returns that the HR department is seeing with regard to retaining star workers, he added.\n\nStill, technology isn't a silver bullet, he pointed out. \"I don't think there's one product that can see me through the entire life cycle. All your SAPs, IBM Kenexas - all of these are striving for that goal. But the management of people is more complex than that.\"\n\nNo matter how intelligent a system becomes in automatically crunching data against a model, that model needs to be constantly shifted by the management to keep up with reality, he said.\n\nA salesperson still needs to answer why a customer was lost, or why the department did well in that month. \"Data has the key to the success. But people are needed to know how to X-Ray it and build a story around it,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

If a new election date is declared, then we'll take care of every province and the election won't be successful again,\" protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban told supporters late on Thursday.\n\nThe protests are the latest chapter in an eight-year crisis that pits Bangkok's middle class and royalist establishment against supporters of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and her brother, ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who was toppled by the army in 2006 and lives in exile to avoid a jail term for graft.\n\nNow in their fifth month, the protesters have shut government offices and at times blocked major thoroughfares in Bangkok to try to force Ms Yingluck out. Twenty-three people have died and hundreds have been injured in the violence.\n\nMs Yingluck called the election in December to try to defuse the protests and since then has headed a caretaker government with limited powers. The violence and political paralysis has dented confidence, prompting cuts to economic growth forecasts.\n\nMs Yingluck's Puea Thai Party had been expected to win but the main opposition Democrat Party threw in its lot with the protesters and has demanded electoral changes before any vote, seeking to reduce the influence of Mr Thaksin. Parties led by or allied to him have won every election since 2001.\n\nThe protesters retreated this month to a Bangkok park and the battleground has moved from the streets to the courts. Ms Yingluck faces a spate of legal challenges that could bring down her government, including a charge of dereliction of duty related to a disastrous rice-buying scheme.\n\nMr Thaksin's \"red shirt\" supporters, who are strong in the north and north-east, are beginning to make militant noises, raising the prospect of more violence if Ms Yingluck is forced out by the courts, the anti-corruption commission or by other means.\n\n\"Independent agencies are being quite obvious that they want to remove her and her entire cabinet to create a power vacuum, claim that elections can't be held and then nominate a prime minister of their choice,\" said Kan Yuenyong, a political analyst at the Siam Intelligence Unit. \"If they run with this plan, then the government's supporters will fight back and the next half of the year will be much worse than what we saw in the first half.\"\n\nThe streets have been relatively calm since several big protest sites were shut at the start of March and a state of emergency was lifted on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, police reported that three grenades exploded just before midnight on Thursday near the home of one of the Constitutional Court judges. One person was slightly injured.

Under his leadership, South Asia became one of the top performing regions of the bank.\n\nSaid Jaspal Bindra, StanChart Asia group executive director and chief executive: \"We remain very committed to Singapore, which is an important and strategic market for Standard Chartered. It is the second- largest contributor to group income and profits; it is where our global businesses operate; and the main driver of income for Asean.\n\n\"The bank's strategy to position the Singapore franchise as central to the opportunities in Asean will be strengthened by Neeraj's regional knowledge.

That's where your rice cooker comes into play and even then, not all cookers are created equal. Enter, then, the Hitachi IH Rice Cooker which is made in Japan and carries a commensurate price tag that starts at $999. But would you pay one grand for a rice cooker when a $40 no-name brand cooks your daily serving of Thai rice just fine?\n\nTherein lies the rub. While there are those who swear by the quality of Tsukiji market cheap sushi, the reality is that the price-quality ratio applies to rice cookers as much as it does raw fish. The difference may not be immediately discernible, but it is there.\n\nIn putting the Hitachi through its paces, we follow Yuichi Sato's instructions for making good rice. Rinse the rice gently for 30-40 seconds each time, then soak for half an hour before cooking (which can be programmed by the cooker). Do not follow the same rules as when cooking Thai rice, warns Mr Sato. Measuring the rice correctly is imperative, so use a 180cc cup where possible. The ratio of rice to water is 1:1, he adds, although the best is to follow the markings in the rice cooker bowl. The Hitachi gives measurements for normal, soft and hard(sushi) textures.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n4\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\n5\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal", "images": []}

As it is hosted in the cloud, the service can be deployed quickly, avoiding the long provisioning lead times associated with traditional infrastructure implementations.\n\nCalling it an integrated cloud communications service for enterprises in Asia-Pacific, SingTel's Bill Chang said that the service comprises a hosted suite of products that include voice, video, messaging and presence.\n\nMr Chang, who is chief executive officer of SingTel Group Enterprise, added that UCaaS epitomises what he calls \"everything-as-a-service\".\n\n\"It combines SingTel's expertise in the areas of cloud, mobility, voice and fixed data network services to create a single service offering that will change the face of business collaboration for enterprises,\" he said. He added that by taking UCaaS into the cloud, SingTel relieves enterprises of the burden of managing their own communications infrastructure and offers them a scalable and flexible solution Asia-wide.\n\nThis is the latest addition to SingTel's suite of cloud services for enterprises which include Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service, Software-as-a-Service, Connectivity-as-a-Service and Security-as-a-Service, among others. The offerings are designed to help enterprises be leaner and more efficient while staying at the forefront of technology.\n\nUCaaS is hosted in SingTel's data centres across the Asia-Pacific. Built into SingTel ConnectPlus, Asia's leading Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network, it eliminates the integration complexity for enterprises which require seamless voice, data and video services, said Mr Chang.\n\nThe service is offered on a per-employee monthly subscription scheme and is flexible, catering for those who are desk-bound or on the move.\n\n\"The phenomenal growth in the smartphone and mobile device adoption in many Asian markets has resulted in the blurring of lines between work and play,\" Mr Chang said, adding: \"By leveraging SingTel UCaaS, enterprises across Asia can empower their workforce to be more productive by facilitating the ease of contacting and collaborating with their colleagues or external stakeholders anytime, anywhere and on any device.\"\n\nIrving Tan, Cisco's Asean vice-president, said that his company was proud to have provided the foundation for SingTel to launch its UCaaS service in the Asia-Pacific region. \"Our collaboration with SingTel further demonstrates Cisco's commitment to helping them monetise their cloud offerings while promoting seamless, global reliability and agility.\n\n\"Using Cisco collaboration technologies, SingTel and Optus can roll-out their UCaaS to customers across the region and also help businesses that are expanding into Asia-Pacific, providing increased speed to market and reduced operational complexities while ultimately achieving efficiency and productivity.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the modern, globalised economy, things normally work well. When they don't, the causes can usually be identified, and changes often follow to prevent recurrence. So far, MH370 is a distressing exception.\n\nUntil a few decades ago, a plane that disappeared from radar would simply be gone. Today, though, it is normally possible to unravel almost all such mysteries. There is much more knowledge than ignorance in technical matters. Aircraft have numerous onboard systems to ensure they are going where they should be and working as they should be. These interact with overlapping communications and tracking arrangements on land and in space. Indeed, so much information is generated in the normal course of flying that, without expert knowledge, the Boeing 777 aircraft could not have come so close to disappearing from electronic sight.\n\nThe cloud of information surrounding aircraft is particularly thick, perhaps because the idea of flying seems exceptionally unnatural to many people. However, most parts of the modern economy are remarkably well monitored and measured - and more so all the time. Tastes and practices can be traced with uncanny precision. Cameras track people's movement, sensors watch machines and buildings, labels track when and where a product was made. When something goes wrong, the precise problem can almost always be identified.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

At the same time, private equity funds are buying into distressed (assets) so you may have the same private equity funds also investing in shipping for asset appreciation.\"\n\nHe said that this situation could possibly increase in the near term as private equity funds are very liquid, with about US$800 billion at their disposal, and he believes that at least a substantial portion of this may be poured into shipping.\n\nOthers point out that the PE portion of the overall financing equation is still low, so while there may be room for more growth in future, this also means that PE firms are taking a more calculated approach towards the sector.\n\nDomenik Nizet, senior vice-president of the tanker group at DVB Bank in Singapore, elaborated: \"The sector has about US$250 billion to be covered by debt financing every year and from that amount, we see about US$5 billion coming from private equity. So we are talking about a 3-5 per cent PE share range of the overall financing (in the sector).\"\n\nMr Nizet suggested that this volume also means that PE firms are not just throwing money into shipping projects but they are closely scrutinising which projects they invest in.\n\nIt is this focus on numbers that underpins the strong believe that PE capital may not make the maritime sector their home.\n\nMr Belbas explained that private equity funds are mainly \"asset agnostic\" and therefore when the market improves, they may exit and move on as he does not believe that too many of them would want to become shipowners for the long term.\n\nMoreover, with shipping offering more longer-term returns than shorter-term gains, industry players doubt that PE firms will wait that long and so this in itself may deter large volumes of private equity capital from coming into the industry to replace institutional debt financing.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Samuel Ee\n\nListen to this article\n\nPublished Fri, Mar 21, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHERE may be two Porsche Macan compact SUV models, both with turbocharged V6 petrol engines, but only one is called the Macan Turbo. The other is the Macan S. The Macan Turbo is, for now, the top-of-the-line Macan with a newly developed 3.6-litre V6 twin turbo petrol engine producing 400 hp and 550 Nm. But the Macan S also has a similar power plant - a 3.0-litre V6 twin turbo with 340 hp and 460 Nm.\n\nTo differentiate them more clearly, Porsche has specified the Macan Turbo with more equipment and a plusher cabin. And this is reflected in the kerb weight of each variant - 1,925 kg for the Turbo versus 1,865 kg for the S.\n\nStill, the Macan S is a very nice luxury SUV with a beautiful interior. The Macan is based on the Audi Q5 but with two-thirds of its components changed to deliver a car that drives like a Porsche. Key to this difference is the Macan's suspension tuning. Although it retains the same suspension architecture as the Q5, Porsche has new dampers and springs for better handling. And to improve steering feel, the bearings were changed too. It shows on the road. Compared with the Audi SQ5 with a 3.0-litre V6 supercharged engine, the Macan S has superior handling. There is virtually no high-speed float on the autobahn, with superb composure displayed in sweeping curves.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n4\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\n5\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal", "images": []}

The Montreal-based company also reached a tentative deal to establish a turboprop assembly line in Russia and said that it expected to sign definitive agreements this year.\n\nLike the US and other allies, Canada has imposed financial sanctions and travel bans on Russian officials. Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government has also recalled its ambassador to Russia, suspended military cooperation and pledged C$220 million (S$250 million) in financial aid to Ukraine.\n\nUS President Barack Obama has signed a new executive order authorising, though not implementing, economic sanctions affecting parts of the Russian economy. They included financial services, energy, metals and mining, defence and engineering.\n\n\"Obviously we are going to respect whatever sanctions\" are put in place, Mr Beaudoin said. \"That's a good thing when you have global countries moving in lockstep.\"\n\nEstimating the delay for the start of the turboprop assembly is impossible because no one knows \"the extent of the potential sanctions or whether this will escalate or not\", he said. \"We were in negotiations to get this done in 2014. Will it be a one-month delay, a six-month delay, a one-year delay?\"\n\nWhile Russia accounted for about US$250 million of Bombardier's 2013 sales of US$18.2 billion, Mr Beaudoin said that future revenue could be much larger.\n\nRussia and other former Soviet republics could buy as many as 350 turboprops in the coming years, Guy Hachey, president of Bombardier's aerospace unit, said last Thursday at the company's investor day in New York.\n\n\"For Bombardier, Russia is not that big today, but it's a very large potential country,\" Mr Beaudoin said. \"Like many international companies, we are going to follow this very closely.\"\n\nBombardier is also wooing Russian airlines to buy its newest and biggest jetliner, the CSeries, which the company predicts will enter service late next year.\n\nRussian leasing company Ilyushin Finance Co last year agreed to buy at least 32 CSeries jets in an order valued at about US$2.56 billion at catalog prices.\n\n\"Getting a leasing company in a new market is the first thing that's important,\" Mr Beaudoin said. \"Then you talk to airlines, and airlines will typically say, 'I'll buy two and lease three.' That's why Ilyushin is important.\"\n\nBombardier expects the CSeries will contribute US$5-8 billion a year in new revenue later this decade, Mr Beaudoin told analysts and investors in New York last Thursday, reiterating an earlier forecast.\n\nBombardier's Class B shares has declined 9.5 per cent this year, trailing the 5.4 per cent gain of Canada's benchmark Standard & Poor's/TSX Composite Index.\n\n\"Russia is going to be a major market for the Q400 and the CSeries,\" Chris Murray, an analyst at AltaCorp Capital Inc, said last Thursday by telephone from New York. \"You don't want to see it go away.\"\n\nBombardier is studying whether to build a 50-seat version of the Q400 in which half of the space would be devoted to the cargo area, Mr Beaudoin also said. Currently, the turboprop seats 71-86 passengers.\n\n\"Some customers are saying they'd like half-cargo, half- passengers, and we're looking at this,\" Mr Beaudoin said. \"We would have a significant competitive advantage because our competitor can't do that. We look at our strengths to find new niches for the Q400 with customers that we don't have today.\"\n\nSeparately, Mr Beaudoin said that Bombardier's train division would consider buying Finmeccanica SpA's Ansaldo STS and AnsaldoBreda units if it can find a partner to bid on the assets.\n\nItaly's Finmeccanica is seeking to sell businesses including Ansaldo STS, a rail-signalling company, and AnsaldoBreda, which makes rolling stock, to focus on aerospace and defence.\n\n\"Right now our capital is all going to developing airplanes, so I want to make sure from an investor perspective that if - and it's a big if - this comes as an opportunity, we would look at doing it with a financial partner,\" Mr Beaudoin said. \"I think at one point there will be an opportunity, but it has got to be right.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/b19c88188711ab0a6efc3e79e144c095858480bb8512a0da20ae288a237444b5?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "On hold: Bombardier had signed a letter of intent in August to sell Russia's Rostekhnologii as many as 100 Q400 turboprop aircraft (above). -\u00a0PHOTO: BLOOMBERG"}]}

Relying on all-cash offers, he has outbid the world's biggest institutional funds and professional property investors, such as Tishman Speyer Properties LP.\n\n\"He's at the very highest levels of high net worth investment and competing with some of the biggest sovereign wealth funds for the primest properties in the market,\" said Joseph Kelly, director of market analysis for Real Capital Analytics in London, a real estate research firm.\n\nIn the past four months alone, Mr Ortega has spent almost US$1 billion purchasing properties in Manhattan's meat-picking district, London's West End, Beverly Hills' Rodeo Drive and Barcelona's main shopping drag, Passeig de Gracia. He recently paid one of the highest prices per square foot ever for a London office building.\n\nIn late 2011, Manhattan-based Tishman Speyer, which owns Yankee Stadium, Rockefeller Center, the Chrysler Building and London's Tower Place, was close to finalising the purchase of Madrid's most famous skyscraper, the 43-storey Picasso Tower office building.\n\nAt the last minute, the building's owner instead accepted a 400 million euro (S$705 million) bid from Mr Ortega, according to two people familiar with the deal who asked not to be identified because the negotiations weren't public. Unlike Tishman Speyer's offer, Mr Ortega's was all-cash.\n\nMr Ortega, the founder and majority shareholder of Inditex SA, the world's largest fashion retailer, is taking refuge in real estate as a safe long-term investment, particularly with US Treasury yields near record lows, according to real estate professionals. By comparison, the fashion industry is notoriously fickle. Inditex has suffered recent downgrades in ratings by analysts as a result of slowing growth.\n\nMr Ortega's personal real estate portfolio may be closing the gap with Donald Bren, chairman of Irvine Co of southern California, often cited as the world's wealthiest real estate investor. Mr Bren's properties are worth US$14.4 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nA handful of other billionaires tap their personal fortunes to compete on such deals. They include Mexican telecommunications magnate Carlos Slim, Brazilian banker Moise Safra, the Conley and Otto families of Germany and Chinese real estate developer Zhang Xin, said Mr Kelly.\n\nWhile Mr Ortega, 77, has sunk billions into premier locations in some cities at the top of the market, in Spain he's taken advantage of the country's economic woes to acquire buildings for deep discounts. The 400 million euros he paid for the Picasso Tower was less than half its value four years earlier, according to a 2007 filing by the building's former owner valuing the entire property at 850 million euros.\n\nSpanish property prices have collapsed since its real estate boom ended in 2007 and the country plunged into the worst economic slump of the past 40 years.\n\nHome prices and prime office rents have both fallen more than 40 per cent since 2007.\n\n\"He's clearly making a big bet on office space in the centre of the city at a time when all the big Spanish companies with offices in the centres of Madrid, Barcelona and Bilbao sold out and moved out to middle of nowhere,\" said Ken Dubin, a professor at IE Business School in Madrid and the Lord Ashcroft International Business School in Cambridge.\n\n\"To the extent corporate flight can lead to the collapse not just of property values but lots of other things in a city, it's important he's making these big investments,\" Mr Dubin said. \"And the fact he's making them obviously gets other people into the game and attracts attention.\"\n\nMadrid's Picasso Tower - so named because of its proximity to the Plaza de Pablo Ruiz Picasso - is one of many properties Mr Ortega has purchased near or on the Paseo De La Castellana, Madrid's main commercial drag. Elsewhere in Spain, he recently paid US$60 million to buy the remaining stake in a building that houses Barcelona's flagship Apple store, a property he had already invested US$105 million in during 2012. In Valencia, he bought another Apple store building for US$30 million late last year.\n\n\"It's an enormous consolidation of power,\" Mr Dubin said. \"The percentage of square feet of prime space that is in the possession of this one man in this country, there are few parallels in other countries the size and wealth of Spain.\"\n\nMr Ortega's properties worldwide generated rental income of at least US$290 million during 2012, the most recent year records are available. Roberto Cibeira Moreiras, investment director of Mr Ortega's main holding company, declined to comment. \"Our policy, given we are a private company, doesn't contemplate interviews,\" he said.\n\nMr Ortega rents some of his properties to his Zara stores. By effectively becoming his own landlord, he benefits two ways. He gains a tenant who is unlikely to leave or make exorbitant demands, while Inditex enjoys a friendly owner unlikely to impose big rent increases. On Madrid's Calle Serrano, an upscale shopping street, a building he purchased in 2011 is being renovated. It will soon reopen as Zara's flagship store for Madrid, one of more than 1,800 Inditex stores across the country.\n\nTo be sure, Mr Ortega has been shedding some assets. In January, he sold his 4.05 per cent stake in NH Hoteles SA, the Spanish hotel company. And he and his fellow investors in another hotelier, Occidental Hotels & Resorts, are in talks to sell their stake for as much as US$700 million, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr Ortega is Spain's version of Sam Walton, who established in rural Arkansas what would become the world's largest retailer. Mr Ortega similarly created a multibillion-euro fortune in Arteixo, Spain, a tiny industrial town far from any major metropolitan area.\n\nThe son of a railway worker from northern Spain, he opened his first Zara store in 1975. Its parent company, Inditex, now generates almost US$21 billion in annual sales. The company earned US$3 billion in fiscal year 2013, operating more than 6,200 stores around the world under Zara and other brands, including Massimo Dutti, Bershka and Pull & Bear.\n\nMr Ortega, who is worth US$61.2 billion, stepped down as chairman of the company in 2011. Famously press shy, he retains a 59 per cent ownership stake in Inditex. His tiny real estate staff operates from a glass office building on Inditex's campus in Arteixo.\n\nThe precise value of his empire is unclear. He has spent at least US$6 billion over the past decade in cities including Berlin, Paris, Chicago, Boston, Miami, Washington and San Francisco, according to Real Capital Analytics and public records. The purchases were mostly made through subsidiaries of Pontegadea Inversiones SL, the bigger of his two main real estate holding companies.\n\nAccording to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Mr Ortega's real estate businesses are valued at US$5.8 billion, based on their 2012 financial results and the price-to-book value of four publicly traded comparable real estate investment trusts: Utrecht, Netherlands-based Corio NV, Paris-based Societe Fonciere Lyonnaise, Amsterdam-based Eurocommercial Properties NV and Escondido, California-based Realty Income Corp. Including his US$1 billion in property acquisitions since 2012, the ranking values Mr Ortega's holdings at US$6.8 billion.\n\nThe US$10 billion estimate comes from a person familiar with Mr Ortega's assets. The person said Mr Ortega owns other properties outside the two main property holding vehicles. The Bloomberg ranking doesn't include those assets because they couldn't be documented.\n\nLike billionaires from Russia, China, Singapore, Abu Dhabi and India, Mr Ortega has been buying up properties in one of the hottest real estate markets - London. In the past three years, he has spent US$1.3 billion there, concentrating on the West End, one of Europe's most expensive neighbourhoods. \"London is the only real global market in the world,\" said Andrew Langton, a high-end residential real estate agent there. \"Every single nationality is here buying property.\"\n\nAt least two of Mr Ortega's London properties are owned through Luxembourg entities, which he inherited from the previous owners, records show. Using subsidiaries in Luxembourg, which has lenient capital gains tax rules, is a common tactic among investors. Inditex also uses tax-haven subsidiaries. As reported by Bloomberg News in February, the retailer has shifted US$2 billion of profits into a low-tax unit in the Netherlands and Switzerland, helping cut its income tax bill around the world.\n\nMr Ortega's most recent high-profile London deal was a \u00a3410 million (S$864 million) purchase in December of Devonshire House, a 1920s office building in the Mayfair district across from the Ritz Hotel. At US$3,641 per square foot, the price was among the highest paid for an office building of that size anywhere in the world, according to Real Capital Analytics.\n\nThe building, on the site of the residence of the Dukes of Devonshire in the 18th and 19th centuries, has retail space on the ground floor, including a Marks & Spencer store.\n\nMr Ortega has also been expanding his portfolio in high-priced US markets. In November, he purchased from a partnership including private equity firm Carlyle Group a 56,000-square-foot office and retail building on Manhattan's West 14th Street for US$94 million.\n\nHe had already spent at least US$220 million on office buildings in midtown Manhattan. And in January, Pontegadea closed on its purchase of a Beverly Hills property on North Rodeo Drive containing a Gucci store for almost US$108 million. Like the Picasso Tower acquisition, the deal was all-cash. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

You get the picture.\n\nAll were relieved that DBS paid a reasonable price as the deal is not expected to strain the group's capital position or net asset value; neither will it have a significant impact on earnings in the short term.\n\nThe contribution to earnings - $50 million profit before tax in year three, according to DBS's chief financial officer - represents chump change or one per cent based on the group's 2013 $5 billion pre-tax profit before allowances.\n\nGone are the days when acquisitions were meant to ring some bells. For sure, the acquisition, which would boost the private bank AUM of DBS by 23 per cent to $85 billion from the current $69 billion, is a big number, moving the bank further up the league table.\n\nThe other point is that it widens the gap with closest rival Bank of Singapore, a unit of OCBC Bank. Back in 2009, when OCBC Bank paid US$1.4 billion for ING Asia Private Bank (with US$16 billion AUM), a substantial premium of 5.8 per cent, its then chief executive was not at all embarrassed that he had overpaid. David Conner defended the premium by calling it a transformational deal as it more than trebled OCBC's private clients AUM to US$23 billion.\n\nInstead of building from scratch, the move gave it a full fledged private bank - extensive products, IT platform, 150 relationship managers (RMs) and more than 5,000 clients - boosting OCBC's vision of making wealth management one of the central planks of its business.\n\nLater renamed Bank of Singapore, AUM has since doubled to US$46 billion last year.\n\n\"DBS is already a significant private bank player, so it is much less game-changing; for OCBC, it was a fundamental entry into the business,\" said Henri Guedeney, partner at AT Kearney Pte Ltd.\n\nIt would seem the strategy has delivered for OCBC. Its wealth management income, which includes a big chunk from its insurance unit, has nearly doubled to $1.9 billion last year from $1 billion in 2009. Wealth management in 2013 contributed 29 per cent to group revenue, up from 21 per cent in 2009.\n\nDBS chief executive Piyush Gupta said the SGPB Asia deal will help raise wealth management contribution to 15 per cent of the group's business in three years. Last year, wealth management income of $924 million made up 10.4 per cent of the group's $8.9 billion.\n\nAnother reason why it is hard to be impressed with DBS's acquisition is that making money from the wealthy in Asia can be illusionary at times.\n\nSure, wealth is growing at a faster clip in Asia than anywhere else in the world. But the Asian rich, many of whom are first generation, are demanding. As savvy business people, they are smarter than many of the RMs selling financial products.\n\nAn entrepreneur knows that if you lose money, it could lead to bankruptcy, and so has little patience when the fund recommended by the RM is said to be outperforming the benchmark, losing, say, \"only\" 2 per cent against a 5 per cent fall in the benchmark.\n\nAccording to a private banking report done by AT Kearney based on interviews with top private bankers and regulators between late 2011 and early 2012, it's a penalising environment.\n\nA high degree of correlation of volatility in markets, low interest rates, the paradigm \"risk on, risk off\" - it all adds up to a formidable operating environment, making it very difficult for banks to generate sustainable returns, it said.\n\nThe industry is further hamstrung by a decline in the number of transactions, an increase in cash holdings and a squeeze on margins.\n\nThe impact of the current penalising environment is most evident in Asia, where the private banking industry's cost-income ratio hovers at about 80 per cent, it said. It hasn't become any easier two years on (from when the interviews were done), said Mr Guedeney.\n\nScale is one of the factors for survival and having another US$12 billion AUM or so is \"very useful\", he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Critics now question how MTA can continue to be relevant.\n\n\"MTA is supposed to be the voice of new car sellers. What is the point if it does not represent the majority of the industry,\" asked the director of a brand who left MTA a few years ago.\n\nBased on last year's total vehicle sales of 34,090 units, MTA members accounted for 46 per cent of total market share (this number is made up of 22,472 new cars, 8,128 commercial vehicles and 3,490 taxis).\n\nIf BMS sales are excluded, this proportion drops to 32 per cent, or barely a third of the market. Volkswagen will then be the biggest brand left in MTA. Last year, VW was Singapore's No 4 make.\n\nBMS declined to comment when contacted. But there is speculation that its departure is largely symbolic, one that signals its displeasure with the association.\n\n\"The annual membership fee is only $1,500, so it's definitely not about the money,\" said the head of a luxury dealership. \"It is probably to make it clear that they do not see the value of MTA membership.\"\n\nIn recent months, some complaints about the MTA included how it appears to champion the causes of only its committee members, and the inability to present members' views and appeals to the government, especially after the recent radical changes to the motor trade, such as the loan curbs and certificate of entitlement tweaks.\n\nThe luxury dealership head recalled that when the vehicle financing restrictions were introduced last year in February, the Singapore Vehicles Traders Association, or SVTA, whose members are mainly used car dealers, immediately met to craft an appeal to the government. The result was the lifting of loan curbs for 60 days to allow members to clear their stocks of second-hand vehicles.\n\nBut, according to the luxury dealership head, the MTA was reluctant to intercede when approached by some members for help to lobby the government to soften the impact of the loan curbs.\n\nSenior MTA committee members could not be contacted for their views. But one industry veteran defended the MTA.\n\n\"To be fair, it does not have an easy time,\" he said, explaining that this is because MTA members have conflicting interests.\n\n\"It is difficult to function as a cohesive organisation because not every brand is impacted by the same issues, such as engine output or emissions,\" he added. \"So there is no unified voice, unlike used car dealers who do not have brand loyalty and can talk about common problems such as policy and financing as a group.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/sgxs-new-rule-clarity-needed", "site_title": "SGX's new rule: clarity needed", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nSGX's new rule: clarity needed\n\nPublished\n\nMon, Mar 17, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE Singapore Exchange's (SGX) recent attempt to enhance its regulatory might was put to its first major test this past week, when Temasek Holdings made an offer for Olam International. The jury is still out on how effective SGX's new rule is, but the incident has definitely highlighted its practical issues.\n\nThe rule in question requires listed companies to notify SGX on a confidential basis if they are in discussions that could lead to a takeover. It was one of several new rules that came into effect on March 3, as part of SGX's attempt to \"enhance its regulatory tools in line with international standards\".\n\nSGX brandished the new rule on Sunday, in its response to criticisms in the media as to why it, as regulator, failed to query the unusual leap in Olam's share price in the lead-up to the offer announcement.\n\nIn what might be seen by some as an attempt to diffuse the attention on SGX, the regulator started off its response by reminding the market that parties to a takeover shared some responsibility, too. It stressed \"the responsibilities placed on potential offerors and/or listed companies when they are in confidential discussions that may lead to a potential takeover offer\".\n\nIt brought up its new March 3 rule, which states that companies are \"required to notify SGX where its board is, either aware of discussions or negotiations of a potential proposal, or in discussion or negotiation on an agreement or document which may lead to a takeover, reverse takeover or a very substantial acquisition by the company\".\n\n\"SGX will keep such notifications confidential\", the rule added.\n\nSGX's decision to bring up the rule, as the starting point of its response, is a curious one. For one, it has the undesirable effect of suggesting that such a rule was not followed, and can be considered to be a rather unfair remark to make at this point, given that Temasek and Olam - bound by takeover rules - cannot confirm or deny that they have informed SGX. Market participants are left none the wiser as to what actually happened.\n\nFor another, it highlights the practical difficulties of enforcing and of complying with this rule - concerns that surfaced among listed companies when the rule was first announced.\n\nFrom the listed companies' point of view, there is great uncertainty as to how exactly they are expected to comply; SGX's Practice Note 7.2 (on this matter) gives little guidance beyond what the rule states. Questions which many have - that remain unanswered - include:\n\nPractice Note 7.2 says this is \"when the board of an issuer is:\n\ni) made aware of discussions or negotiations on a potential proposal; or (ii) in discussion or negotiation on an agreement or document, whether binding or non-binding\".\n\nThis encompasses a whole range of stages: when an expression of interest is first made; when a preliminary offer is put on the table; or when an irrevocable agreement has been entered into. A deal can also fall apart at any point, with the greater possibility occurring when discussions are at a very preliminary stage. So, would it be relevant, timely and useful for SGX to be informed at the first instance that the board is, if this occurs at the most preliminary stage, or only when discussions are more definite?\n\nIf takeover talks are amicable, should all parties involved inform SGX at the same time, so that one party isn't left looking like it shirked its duty?\n\nWhat if the takeover attempt is a hostile one? Should the acquirer announce its intentions to SGX before making its move? It is commonly accepted that the element of surprise is a critical one in hostile takeovers, so one wonders how SGX's rule can be practically adhered to in this case - for example, how much in advance should such a notification be made?\n\nSGX's Practice Note - which states that, \"where the discussions or negotiations are carried out by a controlling shareholder of the issuer and without the knowledge of the issuer, that controlling shareholder shall (through their advisers or otherwise) notify the Exchange directly if the discussions or negotiations are likely to result in the above transactions (takeover or reverse takeover of issuer, or very substantial acquisition by issuer)\" - doesn't quite answer the question.\n\nSGX's Practice Note sets out a simple template of information that needs to be provided in such notifications, including name of issuer, type of transaction, etc. It says notifications should be emailed to\n\nprivylist@sgx.com\n\n. It does not, however, say who mans this email account. So, an issuer does not know if it is a junior or senior officer, a small group of people or an entire department, who will have access to this sensitive information or how secure this email account is.\n\nAnd, should a deal break in the middle of the night, mere hours before an issuer intends to publicly announce it, would sending off an email to this account - when one doesn't know if it is manned at all hours of the day and night - suffice as a proper notification?\n\nThe assumed answer to this question is, \"very\" - as in, every single person who could possibly have knowledge of this deal, including the tea lady who might happen to walk in on discussions in the conference room. If so, it would mean very detailed record-keeping for the entities involved.\n\nThese are some of the practical issues listed companies have to wrangle with. What of SGX's enforcement of the rule?\n\nIt is unclear, at this stage, how SGX intends to deal with the companies that do not comply with the rule; for example, what are the punitive actions it can/will bring against companies that fail to notify the Exchange?\n\nIt is also unclear - based on the aforementioned challenges faced by companies - what exactly constitutes non-compliance. Would non-compliance be notifying a day late, or at the wrong stage, or leaving a name out of the privy list?\n\nIt is also unclear how SGX intends to use the information given to it, to improve its monitoring of trading activities. For example, in the event of a seeming information leak, one assumes the Exchange would use the privy list to question everyone who might have knowledge of the deal. Or it might use the notification email to try to determine when such information became known to which set of people.\n\nIts effectiveness, however, would depend very much on the accuracy of the information provided - which SGX might not have a way of verifying.\n\nThis is not to say that SGX has been remiss in its duty as a regulator; as with every new rule or legislation, greater clarity and understanding always comes with time - seeing how it is implemented, and through observing test cases.\n\nIn this case, the Temasek-Olam deal has served as a reminder of the need for greater clarity on this rule, to enable the market and its regulator to benefit from it.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Temasek declined to comment.\n\nSime Darby's head of communications said: \"We are open to all opportunities for growth and expansion. I am, however, unaware of any specific interest in Olam.\"\n\nAnalysts had said that they did not expect a competing offer for Olam, given that the offer involves existing shareholders with a large stake, and the complex nature of its business.\n\nThe consortium that Temasek leads, which includes Olam's founding firm Kewalram Chanrai and management, already owns 52.5 per cent of the agri-commodities trader.\n\nSime Darby, a motoring-to-plantation conglomerate, has in recent years looked to grow its land bank, as well as diversify into other crops. The group in 2009 secured a 220,000-hectare concession in Liberia, and has said that it is also evaluating expansion opportunities in other parts of Africa.\n\nOlam is developing a 300,000-hectare palm plantation in Gabon in partnership with the government, and also has a 50:50 joint venture with Wilmar International that holds a 27-per cent stake in Sifca, the largest integrated palm player in West Africa.\n\nWhile the Sifca investment is already fully contributing, Olam's plantation in Gabon is still gestating, and will require further investments, the firm said during its results briefing last month.\n\nIt expects the first yields from the first plantation in Gabon to come next year.\n\nPlanting in Gabon is expected to be completed in 2016, Olam had previously said.\n\nMeanwhile, the probability of Olam defaulting on its debt has fallen to an all-time low, according to an analysis by the National University of Singapore Risk Management Institute (RMI).\n\nThe RMI's probability of default measure for Olam fell from nearly 50 basis points in December 2012 to 2.76 basis points this month, said analyst Siddharth Batra.\n\nThe measures takes into account factors such as the current liabilities and long-term liabilities, among others.\n\n\"The probability of default has declined steadily since December 2012, reflecting receding fears on Olam's ability to tide through big acquisitions and its stretched balance sheet,\" said Mr Batra.\n\nTemasek's offer to buy Olam shares that it does not already own at $2.23 a share, valuing the firm at $5.33 billion, is seen by some to help the agri-commodities trader shore up shareholder support ahead of its bonds which will mature in the coming years.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg data, Olam has US$2 billion of bonds due between 2016 and 2018.\n\nUS short-selling firm Muddy Waters had criticised Olam for its overly high leverage and negative cash flow in November 2012.\n\nSince then, Olam has moderated the pace of its capital expenditure and also undertaken initiatives such as sale and leaseback transactions to release cash from its balance sheet.\n\nThe counter closed unchanged at $2.22 yesterday.\n\nWith additional reporting by S Jayasankaran\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Malaysian officials also refuted criticism that they had refused to cooperate with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Tony Abbott discussed the search plan with his Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak, who asked Australia to take responsibility for the southern part of the search zone.\n\nThere's no trace of the Boeing 777-200 plane, which vanished on March 8 with 239 people on board, and the area now being searched stretches from Kazakhstan in the north to the two-mile deep waters off Australia in the south.\n\nMalaysia has cooperated with the FBI and the Interpol from the start of the investigation, Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at the same press conference.\n\nWhile there have been few breakthroughs, authorities established that the plane operated for almost seven hours after its last contact with air traffic controllers. That led to closer scrutiny of the crew.\n\nPolice searched the homes of the pilot and co-pilot on Saturday to help answer why the jet was deliberately flown off its course, racing against time as the trail of isolated signals caught during the journey risks going cold.\n\nThe police have been investigating since March 8 all crew members, including the pilot and the co-pilot, as well as all ground staff handling the aircraft. The police also seized a flight simulator from the pilot's house and are studying it.\n\nMalaysian investigators are treating both the northern and southern search zones with equal importance. Yet, US investigators are growing more convinced the most likely last position of MH370 was in a zone about 1,609 kilometres west of Perth, said two people in the US government who are familiar with the data. Mr Najib was told that is the most promising lead, one of the people said.\n\nMAS can't determine when the plane's Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, which transmits text messages and data to and from planes, was disabled, CEO Ahmad Jauhari said yesterday. The Acars system was disabled just before the jet left Malaysia's east coast and its transponder was switched off near the border between Malaysian and Vietnamese air traffic control, Mr Najib had said at a Saturday briefing.\n\nData that is available indicated the plane was last spotted in an arc that reached as far as Kazakhstan in the north to an area in the Indian Ocean off Australia in the south. Malaysia is now enlisting the help of 26 nations, Mr Hishammuddin said.\n\nThe jet made its last satellite contact at 8:11 am on March 8, according to Mr Najib. Malaysian officials previously said the plane was last tracked by its transponder, a device that helps radar find its location more precisely, at 1:30 am.\n\nBeyond an expanding search area, the investigation has turned toward the pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah and Fariq Abdul Hamid, the first officer. Mr Fariq, 27, joined the airline in 2007, while Mr Zaharie had worked at the carrier since 1981 and logged 18,365 flying hours.\n\nThe deeper probe of the two men by police included interviewing family members.\n\nThe longest period in modern aviation history between an airliner's disappearance and initial findings of debris took place seven years ago, when Adam Air Flight 574 disappeared off the coast of Indonesia's South Sulawesi. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

The offer price of $2.23 represented a premium of 11.8 per cent over the last traded price before the announcement.\n\nThe consortium that a Temasek unit is leading includes Olam's management and its founding firm, and already owns a combined stake of 52.5 per cent.\n\nTemasek said that it intended to keep Olam listed, but kept the option to reassess its position if the minimum public float requirement of 10 per cent was not met.\n\nMr Greene said that Olam's credit profile is \"relatively weak\", with gross debt of $9.1 billion and an Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) of $1.2 billion in the 2013 calendar year.\n\nLike other analysts who believed that the deal would benefit Olam in obtaining funding, he said: \"Now with Temasek firmly in the picture, Olam will benefit from the financing halo effect, although Temasek does not guarantee the debts of its operating subsidiaries.\"\n\nThe 34.8 per cent surge in Olam's share price in the six weeks after Feb 3 has also led many to question whether there had been a leak in information prior to the announcement. The Singapore Exchange, in a statement on Sunday, noted that there had been a general re-rating of commodities firms Noble Group, Olam and Wilmar International, and that trading in these stocks were within the price ranges set out in research reports.\n\nBesides these, and a good set of results that Olam announced on Feb 14, market talk revealed that there have been at least three separate parties interested in acquiring Olam during the same period, potentially pushing up its share price as well.\n\nSime Darby, one of the largest palm oil producers in the world, is said to be one of them. Two Japanese trading companies are also said to be interested in Olam due to its exposure to African markets.\n\nThis comes as investor interest in agriculture picks up, with more agribusiness companies looking at vertical integration in the area of production to tie up supply, The Business Times earlier reported.\n\nAnalysts had said that they did not expect a competing offer for Olam, given that the offer involves existing shareholders with a large stake, and the complex nature of its business.\n\nOlam's shares ended two cents lower at $2.21 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Just to give you an idea, my student found that 75 per cent of responses to price queries are 'no explanation' responses. If companies know that they will be slapped with a Trade With Caution if they provide no explanation, we may see such 'no explanation' responses reducing.\"\n\nOther observers welcomed the query as being long overdue. \"JC&C is a heavyweight in the Straits Times Index and regularly displays large price movements - up and down - so trading in its shares should be subject to greater scrutiny,\" said a dealer with a local brokerage.\n\nAnother noted that JC&C's shares often move with only very small volume done. \"The trades are typically done with metronomic regularity - one lot done, followed by two lots, followed by one lot and so on,\" he said. \"It is a very odd trading pattern.\"\n\nDavid Gerald, president of the Securities Investors Association of Singapore, described the JC&C case and the new notification as encouraging developments.\n\n\"For too long, investors have been kept in the dark when companies provide boilerplate replies to SGX queries,\" he said. \"Trade With Caution should be taken seriously and sometimes investors need to be told to exercise care. This is a good move.\"\n\nVeteran market activist Denis Distant also welcomed the move. \"It's good that SGX queried JC&C because it shows that it's not just penny stocks that they will go after.\"\n\nJC&C's shares yesterday fell 63 cents to $43.21 with 217 lots done.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the six weeks since Feb 3, Olam's counter had jumped 34.8 per cent, leading market watchers to ask if some had gotten wind of the deal. Others questioned why Olam did not request for a trading halt earlier, and was not queried by SGX.\n\n\"We will spare no effort in conducting investigations on possible transgressions and will cooperate with regulatory agencies to enforce the law against offenders,\" SGX said in its statement.\n\nUnder new rules which came into effect on March 3, listed companies are required to inform the bourse if their board is aware of discussions of a potential proposal, or in talks on an agreement which may lead to a takeover of the company.\n\nSGX did not indicate whether it had been notified by Olam but said: \"We do not discuss our dealings with regards to individual companies, including notifications as required under the listing rules. If there are possible breaches of rules or requirements, we will investigate and take appropriate action.\"\n\nOlam declined to comment. Said a spokesman: \"The offer made by Breedens Investments is subject to the Takeover Code, and we have been advised that we should not make any comment on the offer except by way of a board-approved announcement.\"\n\nTemasek unit Breedens Investments Pte Ltd is leading a consortium to put up $2.53 billion to buy the rest of Olam that the group does not own. As at last Friday, the group owned a combined stake of 52.5 per cent.\n\nAsked if it had notified SGX of the intended offer, Temasek declined comment and said: \"All our discussions with the regulators are on a strictly confidential basis.\"\n\nBesides requiring companies to keep material information confidential, the new rules which kicked in this month also require them to keep a list of names of persons privy to the transaction, requestable by SGX as and when necessary.\n\nIn its response, SGX also sought to put Olam's share price jump into context. Olam's 34.8 per cent price jump in the six weeks leading up to the takeover announcement had surpassed those of its peers, Wilmar International which rose 11.2 per cent, and Noble Group which rose 12.6 per cent over the same period.\n\nSGX said that trading in these three stocks were within the price ranges set out in analysts' research reports, suggesting that they were trading within the general market view, with Olam shares reflecting a more positive market view.\n\nIt noted that of the 13 analysts who issued reports on Olam in February, seven had raised their target price by an average of 10.4 per cent, with the highest increase being 21.4 per cent. Target prices for the stock ranged from $1.50 to $2. Olam ended Friday at $2.23, which was the offer price.\n\nIn Wilmar's case, eight analysts raised their target price by an average of 2.6 per cent, with the highest increase being 4.8 per cent. For Noble, one analyst raised its target price in February.\n\n\"(Hence,) such comparisons should be conducted with care as the financials and outlook of individual companies may differ even if they are within the same industry,\" SGX noted.\n\nOver the weekend, Carson Block, founder of US shortselling firm Muddy Waters which in November 2012 betted against Olam and said that the commodities trader faced insolvency risks, observed that the timing of Temasek's offer for Olam was \"interesting\".\n\nIn an e-mail to media, Mr Block said: \"The Singapore sovereign wealth fund's timing is interesting given that Olam has $1.2 billion of debt maturing this year and is still burning cash, and that the stock has inexplicably outperformed in the past month.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A beacon to help controllers track the jet was shut off. So was the text-and-data system to help the airline stay in touch with the crew.\n\nThe mystery may spur a redesign of switches that let pilots sever the connections, and speed adoption of satellite technology for real-time tracking of planes and crucial systems, said George Hamlin, a former Airbus SAS executive.\n\n\"The book of rules is written in blood,\" Mr Hamlin said, citing the catchphrase used among aviation professionals. \"Many of the rules were written because people discovered how things could go wrong that were unknown before.\"\n\nEven a cockpit voice recorder that is part of the so-called black box may not provide tell-tale clues if the 777-200 operated for four hours after controllers lost contact, as satellite data suggests. The unit keeps only two hours of audio as it overwrites older material in a continuous loop, said Todd Curtis, president of Seattle-based consultant\n\nAirSafe.com\n\n.\n\nFlight MH370 last appeared on air controllers' screens as it approached Vietnamese airspace at a cruising altitude over the Gulf of Thailand on March 8. The last voice communication was normal, according to Malaysia Airlines.\n\nBefore contact was lost, the jet's radar signature was enhanced by its transponder, which gives air traffic managers details about the target they're tracking. Pilots can code them to emit distress signals for an emergency or hijacking, said Hans Weber, president of San Diego-based Tecop International, a consultant focusing on aviation safety and security issues.\n\nThe jet concerned was also outfitted with the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, dubbed Acars, which lets pilots send text message-like communiques to flight operations staff.\n\nThe technology allows the jet itself to send reports via satellite or radio to ground handlers of any abnormal performance or mechanical breakdowns. Transmissions to Malaysia Airlines and engine-maker Rolls-Royce ceased shortly into flight, the companies said in statements.\n\nMalaysia Airlines didn't subscribe to a popular Boeing add-on: a maintenance program to beam real-time information to the Chicago-based planemaker, said a person familiar with the jetliner, who wasn't authoriaed to speak on the record. Boeing compiles the data and sends maintenance alerts to participants in its Airplane Health Management programme.\n\nAnyone intent on ending aircraft data communications would need to turn a switch to silence the transponder or disable a cockpit circuit-breaker to cut off Acars, said Bill Waldock, professor of safety science who teaches accident investigations at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona.\n\nFlight MH370's interrupted Acars data feed indicates intervention by \"someone who knows the system on the airplane\", Mr Waldock said. \"That has to be the crew or someone who's intimately familiar with how a 777 operates.\"\n\nEven without the flow of Acars reports to the ground, the jet's position was tracked to near Australia by analysing pings from a transmitter that signalled a satellite about once an hour after the transponder went dead and the plane veered off its northerly course, said the person familiar with the analysis.\n\nInvestigators narrowed the jetliner's possible routes by mapping the satellite contacts that continued after Acars and other systems were shut down, according to three people familiar with the work.\n\nThe pulses provide no data about the plane's speed, location or altitude. Still, they allow calculations of an arc along the earth's surface where the plane was each time it communicated with the satellite.\n\nAs the industry assesses how to forestall communication gaps in the future, Airbus Group and Chicago-based Boeing will have to balance design changes against a host of considerations, from the costs for airlines to the risk of saddling air crews with technology they can't control.\n\nRequiring more satellite-based flight monitoring may spur objections from airlines about the expense, said Mr Curtis, who worked on the 777's development as a Boeing employee in the 1990s. Pilots also want to be able to prevent a cockpit fire or short-circuit by pulling the plug on any electronic device, like a transponder or the Acars system.\n\n\"Under normal circumstances, in flight you would never shut them off unless you wanted to hide,\" said Denny Kelly, a former airline pilot who runs an accident-investigation consultancy in Dallas.\n\nMr Hamlin, the former Airbus executive, said one easy fix would be making switches for transponders, cockpit voice recorders and data tracking more cumbersome to turn off.\n\nWilson Chow, a Boeing spokesman, declined to comment on how MH370 might affect aircraft design, as did Mary Anne Greczyn, a US spokeswoman for Toulouse-based Airbus Group.\n\nData communications as basic as the aircraft-performance signals sent via Acars were pivotal in unravelling the 2009 Air France jet crash in South Atlantic.\n\nFor MH370, the cutoff of that data for an unknown period leaves a hole in investigators' understanding of what happened during its final moments.\n\nOn-board voice recorders can be disabled by a circuit- breaker in the cockpit, Mr Hamlin said. Mr Curtis said recovering the flight's recorders also may prove little if the two hours of recording capacity weren't enough to capture any course change.\n\n\"Passengers' electronics could be absolutely essential to determine what happened and when it happened,\" he said.\n\nFlight MH 370 is already sparking renewed talk about implementing satellite-based tracking, to span areas beyond radar coverage and provide airlines and controllers more information about what's occurring in the air.\n\nWith technology that's more advanced than after the Air France crash - and with the expense of dozens of ships and planes hunting for debris - closer monitoring of planes may be an idea whose time is at hand, Mr Weber said.\n\nCompiling that data would eliminate the need for data and voice recorders on planes. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

The huge value was due to buybacks by DBS Group Holdings with 2.1 million shares purchased (March 10-14) for $33.4 million at an average of $15.92 each.\n\nThe buybacks, accounting for 6 per cent of the stock's trading volume, were made on the back of the 9 per cent drop in the share price since January from $17.41.

Money market funds are not new in China, but Yu E Bao was the first to create economies of scale by pooling together small investors who park idle money in their accounts with Alibaba's online payment system.\n\nAlong the way, Yu E Bao, meaning \"leftover treasure\", has revolutionised how funds are raised in China. Its existence, as well as its high profitability, ironically, owes much to the funding needs of the banks themselves.\n\nAlibaba commissions the money it has raised through the Yu E Bao programme to a fund manager, Tianhong Asset Management, which it acquired last year. Tianhong, in turn, lends the money, via private placements, to banks in need of short-term liquidity but which are having trouble getting it directly from the interbank market.\n\nWang Dengfeng, the fund manager of Yu E Bao, disclosed a week ago that it lends primarily to a dozen big and mid-sized banks, which are among the 29 major banks on the regulator's white list.\n\nHe said it shuns away from dealing with small and regional banks, and that most of its investors are small depositors whose savings fall well below 50,000 yuan - not enough to qualify them for high-yielding wealth management products offered by banks.\n\nA prolonged credit squeeze endured by many Chinese banks, mainly the 13 joint stock commercial banks, has given Yu E Bao an opening to profit from the banking system's funding shortfalls. The pain of this credit crunch was felt most acutely in June and December, when Chinese companies had to balance their bi-annual budgets.\n\nBanks are having trouble meeting their funding obligations for long-term projects, mainly those in real estate, mining, commodities and steel, because quietly and steadily the Chinese central bank has been tightening the screws on the national money supply.\n\nShui Pi, a popular financial commentator and editor-in-chief of the Beijing-based China Times newspaper, said: \"The root cause is a quiet, invisible transition induced by the central bank to shift away from an ultra-loose monetary policy of the last few years. If we continue living on loose money, it'd turn into a disaster.\n\n\"It's a big dilemma. These mid-size banks are tapping short-term financing to pay for long-term funding obligations, all because they were expanding too fast.\n\n\"It has nothing to do with bad loans. It's because commercial banks have expanded their loan books too aggressively, too quickly. They made the wrong calls when the economy slowed down. They were too optimistic in their misguided expectations about the central bank's monetary policy.\"\n\nStill, Mr Shui thinks the problem will be brought under control once banks resolve the mismatches in their loan books, a process he estimates could take about a year.\n\nMost critics and supporters alike, meanwhile, focus on whether Yu E Bao and its many smaller copy cats would threaten the survival of traditional banking with their offer of attractive yields - more than 5 per cent annualised in recent weeks. Deposits in Chinese banks are yielding less than one per cent.\n\nCritics have called Yu E Bao a \"blood-sucking vampire\", saying it would push up overall funding costs in the banking system while taking away deposits from smaller banks.\n\nIts supporters have, however, praised it for its ability to redistribute the unreasonably fat profits previously earned by banks back to small investors. In the process, this has hastened the liberalisation of interest rates in the banking system.\n\nChina International Capital Corp, a domestic investment bank, estimates that the entire banking system's demand deposits are expanding at a pace of about two trillion yuan each year, and that some of this expansion in deposits would now be diverted into money market funds, which could push up banks' funding costs once it flows back in the form of lending to banks.\n\nIn a separate report, its researcher, Mao Junhua, calculated that Yu E Bao would triple its size to 1.5 trillion yuan in 2016.\n\nYu E Bao's Mr Wang said that he does not expect the fund's yields, now at above 5 per cent, to fall below an annual rate of 4.5 per cent anytime soon, because he expects banks to face another credit crunch in May and June.\n\nAlibaba announced on Sunday that it is seeking an initial public offering in the US, but that Yu E Bao will be excluded from it. Separately, Alibaba recently received official approval to set up a commercial bank.\n\nTwo other China Internet giants, Tencent and Baidu, have also entered the online finance arena with online money market funds fashioned after Yu E Bao, though on a far smaller scale. Tencent has also received the green light to set up a commercial bank.\n\nThese forays may have achieved what many liberal economists have failed to accomplish for years - infuse competition into an otherwise unwieldy financial system dominated by state-owned players.\n\nMoody's said on Monday that China's bank asset quality and profitability will worsen this year, given a moderating economy. However, it believes Chinese banks' credit metrics are \"unlikely to deteriorate to a level that will negatively affect their current ratings\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/technology/big-data-not-just-high-end-data-scientists", "site_title": "Big Data is not just for 'high-end' data scientists", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nBig Data is not just for 'high-end' data scientists\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Mar 16, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nBUSINESS intelligence software provider Tableau may be riding the Big Data wave, but its start was initially an uphill journey. Chief scientist and co-founder Pat Hanrahan recounts that the desire to help non-technical users visualise and understand their data was considered a bad idea then.\n\n\"It was considered a bad idea as we would be competing with Microsoft. People were happy with Excel. Everyone was telling us we should go after the very sophisticated users,\" said Mr Hanrahan, who started his career in computer graphics and previously worked at Pixar.\n\nHe added: \"We had read a report that more people use Excel to process data than for financial calculation. But Excel was never designed for that. Add to that the data was going to be more and more important to businesses and everyone would have to be manipulating it. It just seemed obvious that we could do something that would address that market.\"\n\nEvolving from a research project that was started in the late-90s, Mr Hanrahan and two of his Stanford University students decided to take the leap and set up Tableau in 2003.\n\n\"If you think you have a better way of doing something, you're going to try to get it out to the world and get people to use it,\" he said of the entrepreneurial spirit that drove them to move ahead against conventional advice.\n\nIn order to ensure the rationality of their decision, the co-founders - Mr Hanrahan, chief executive officer Christian Chabot and chief development officer Chris Stolte - set realistic milestones. Their goal was to have a customer by the end of the first year. They clinched their first deal with grocery chain Safeway and then an OEM deal with Hyperion. By the end of the first year, they were profitable. That was when they decided to raise money. According to Mr Hanrahan, it took them one week to get funding for US$5 million, but as they were always profitable, they did not use that money.\n\nTen years on, the company achieved an 82 per cent year-on-year jump in revenue to reach US$232.4 million for its 2013 fiscal year. About 25 per cent of the revenue is ploughed back into R&D (research and development).\n\nTableau's customers include TravelSky Technology Ltd, which provides business intelligence and market information on the air travel industry in China. According to Joyce Yu, senior manager at TravelSky, the company has achieved an estimated 90 per cent improvement in time efficiency. \"This translates to getting information out to clients faster, which can have significant impact on their businesses. They rely on the information to make decisions and every minute counts in the travel industry,\" she said.\n\nA team of nine analysts sieve through 10 terabytes of data consisting of almost 100 million rows to pinpoint key performance indicators and unveil any developing trend in the industry. They compile all these into reports and present them to close to 100 client service representatives across China. Prior to adopting Tableau's software, it took two specialists two weeks every month to compile, sort and present their data to clients, which include commercial airlines, airport operators, travel agents and civil aviation institutions. Now, the team takes just one day to sort the data and drop it into the Tableau solution for analysis and for highlighting major developments and competitive trends in the industry. Information can also be presented in customised views according to different customer needs.\n\nMelbourne-based start-up Brand Village uses Tableau's software to provide retail clients with insights on their customers' in-store shopping experience, so that they can finetune their strategies for improving brand loyalty and sales.\n\nWith the solution, Brand Village's own customers can also manipulate and interact with the data themselves using their iPads or PCs.\n\nWhile more companies are jumping onto the Big Data analytics bandwagon, Tableau is sticking to its original intention of helping the average user work with data easily. \"Many people think that Big Data is about all these 'high-end' data scientists. I don't think it is as I think that everyone in the world is going to be manipulating data in the future,\" said Mr Hanrahan.\n\nIn all, Mr Hanrahan and his students have started 15 companies, of which Tableau is the biggest. His advice to startups here: \"I would encourage other entrepreneurs to come here. Entrepreneurs like to help more entrepreneurs. You can just get free advice. But you need support and encouragement.\n\n\"It takes a lot of commitment to think that you can build something that almost everybody can use, as everybody thinks that will never happen. That's when other entrepreneurs come and tell about their experience.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This allowed a myriad of modern functions such as testing projects safely on a virtual server, or quickly moving a company's users over to a mirror server in the event of the main server going down. It's a fundamental building block of cloud-computing technology, because it is a necessary ability element for servers to accommodate peaks in user needs, for instance.\n\nNow, software-defined data centres are the next evolution of that concept. It allows a data centre's physical elements such as storage and CPU (central processing unit) controls to be virtualised. And as more data centres become optimised for cloud-style performance, the industry is starting to take software-defined technologies seriously as a holistic architecture. But the complexity of managing software-defined assets has made it far more complex for smaller firms to handle.\n\nMr Hoh said: \"In the past, if the light went out on a server, you'd know it wasn't working. But now there isn't a physical machine so you can't tell if it's switched on.\"\n\nWhile small companies may be able to put off moving to a software-defined architecture for a little longer, they might still have to run up against it because of its prevalence in third party cloud providers, which smaller firms are more likely to rely on, as well.\n\nSymantec is angling for a ride on the backs of large virtualisation vendors, as more firms take up their software-defined offerings. The security and back-up products vendor has been pushing back-up solutions for cloud servers, supporting specific vendors such as VMware and Microsoft, in the hopes of catching the new wave of spending on software-defined products.\n\nMr Hoh said: \"The whole point of virtual resources is to make it easy to start up a server and shut it down, leaving no trace. But that means a user can accidentally take down a working server as well with a button. Where are the controls?\"\n\nAccording to a November 2013 study released by 451 Research, enterprise spending trends are moving towards software-defined technologies. Spending on hardware is predicted to slow over the next two years, as attention shifts to virtualisation and software automation that will allow IT administrators to create and run software-defined data centres, it said.\n\n\"Server professionals are switching their attention to the software required to run cloud-ready data centres, with spending increasing across the board in 2014 as compared with 2013, almost the exact opposite of the situation for infrastructure technologies,\" said the study.\n\nThe year 2013 saw most of the money going to software for virtualised data centres, and 2014 will usher in bigger cloud budgets for about 30 per cent of the pack. Not surprisingly, virtualised storage is the next technology leap for storage as well. The technology allows data to be moved and managed on commodity hardware. With software controls, a company's data can be replicated, with all of a document's different versions tracked.\n\nMr Hoh said adoption of the technology in the Asia-Pacific remains low, although most companies report that they are looking into switching to it.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Indonesia is falling right into it, according to the World Bank's new Jakarta-based country director Rodrigo Chaves.\n\n\"Indonesia needs additional and more focused policy response to stop the economic slide,\" he said.\n\n\"It needs to address these structural changes because the winds are changing.\"\n\nBut as Indonesia begins its phased election season, voting for its House of Representatives on April 9 and then presidency in July, that more focused policy response may not be in the offing until at least October, when a new administration takes office. Until then, mining and trade policies with a nationalistic focus will likely take their toll.\n\nEconomic growth this year is forecast to slip to 5.3 per cent, Mr Chaves said, compared with 5.8 per cent last year. Foreign direct investment will \"remain subdued\" he adds, in part because the country's mineral ore export ban brought to a grinding halt much of the country's US$11.8 billion trade in nickel, copper as well as other mineral products.\n\n\"GDP growth of 5.3 per cent isn't enough to get out of the middle income trap.\"\n\nTo be sure, Indonesia's progress, until now, has been impressive. Since 1960, gross national income was - as measured in 2005 US dollars - US$300 a head. Now, it's closer to US$1,800. The ranks of the poor, those earning US$1.25 a day, have dwindled to about 16 per cent of the population.\n\nBut with most of Indonesia's macroeconomic risks coming from overseas, including the threat of war in Ukraine, moves by the US Federal Reserve to wind back its monetary stimulus, as well as shrinking demand for commodities from China, it makes Indonesia's recent bout of protectionist policies such as the ore export ban that came into effect in January, all the more risky.\n\nA one per cent slowdown in China's rate of GDP growth, trims Indonesia's by 0.5 per cent as investment slows and demand for exports cool, Mr Chaves pointed out.\n\nFutures contracts for palm oil, which accounts for 10 per cent of Indonesia's exports approached US$1,300 a tonne in 2011. Now, their value has fallen by a third. The metals index tabulated by the International Monetary Fund, including nickel, copper, iron ore and others has fallen by a similar amount.\n\n\"(The economy) could go a number of different ways in the event of any of those shocks,\" said Mr Chaves.\n\nThe 1997 Asian financial crisis that triggered the ouster of then-president Suharto plunged 51 million people who were reasonably well off into the ranks of the poor by 1998, noted Mr Chaves. It took eight years to return the country's per capita income to its pre-crisis level.\n\nEven so, Indonesia's relatively consistent improvement in income may be the envy of the likes of Brazil where real GDP per capita growth has staggered between positive and negative rates since the 1970s.\n\nOnly two months into his new job, Mr Chaves sidestepped questions regarding whether Finance Minister Chatib Basri or other well-regarded members of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's outgoing cabinet can affect meaningful change in the months they have left in office.\n\nStill, broadening the tax base and redirecting wasteful spending on fuel subsidies towards infrastructure and improving skills are a must he said. Indonesia needs US$60 billion a year in extra infrastructure investment amounting to 9 per cent of its GDP compared with the 3 per cent it spends now.\n\nIndonesia spends US$21.5 billion subsidising the price of fuel and electricity. The top 10 per cent of the country's income earners enjoy 40 per cent of the subsidy because they drive cars and use more electricity at home than the poor.\n\nFor now, with its legions of young workers supporting a relatively small percentage of elderly, spending on roads and vocational schools will yield outsized dividends. But by 2025 when families have fewer babies and more of its people seek retirement, breaking free, like Singapore and South Korea managed, from the pack of middling performers, will get harder.\n\n\"Those countries got rich before they got older,\" Mr Chaves says.\n\n\"Indonesia may become old before it becomes rich.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It also enhances the diversification of our portfolio across locations and medical specialisations, thereby strengthening First Reit's asset base and maintaining an attractive cash flow and yield profile,\" said Albert Cheok, chairman of Bowsprit, First Reit's manager.\n\nThe acquisition will expand First Reit's portfolio to 15 properties and broaden its asset base by 3.8 per cent from $1.05 billion as at Dec 31, 2013, to $1.09 billion.\n\n\"The larger asset base is expected to enhance First Reit's overall capital management flexibility, which will, among others, facilitate future acquisitions by First Reit,\" the Reit manager added.\n\nThe three-storey and five-storey hospital buildings, with a total gross floor area of 8,254 square metres, has an operational capacity of 100 beds and a maximum capacity of 203 beds, representing an 8.8 per cent increase in the Reit's total number of beds in Indonesia.\n\nIt is undergoing major refurbishment works, which were mostly completed this quarter and are expected to be fully completed in September.\n\nOperations will start under the Siloam Hospitals brand prior to the completion of the acquisition.\n\nWith an initial base rent of $3.4 million per annum and a rental yield of about 11 per cent, which is higher than the other existing properties, First Reit expects to achieve its \"required rate of return\". The master lease is expected to provide stability to First Reit's gross rental income over the next 15 to 30 years, assuming that the option to renew for a further term of 15 years is exercised.\n\nPT PEA will be paid $26.5 million in cash, and the rest of the $4.5 million will be satisfied by the issue of new First Reit units. The unit price will be based on the 10-day volume-weighted average price of the units preceding the date of completion of the acquisition.\n\nThe manager is of the view that the hospital - its second in West Java - is well positioned for the middle to upper middle-income segment of the healthcare market.\n\nIt noted that Purwakarta is strategically located between Jakarta and Bandung, which means that it is able to attract residents from Indramayu and Subang, who previously had to travel long distances to receive good quality healthcare services. The Purwakarta-Bandung highway also acts as a gateway for the rural population to gain access to healthcare services in Purwakarta.\n\nAccording to Frost & Sullivan, Purwakarta has a real gross regional domestic product compound annual growth rate of 5.8 per cent from 2008 to 2012, where manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and agriculture are the key contributing industries.\n\nAssuming First Reit had purchased the hospital on Jan 1, 2013, the pro forma financial effects for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2013, will result in distribution per unit (DPU) increasing by 0.02 cents to 7.54 cents from 7.52 cents and net asset value per unit increasing one cent to $0.98.\n\nOCBC Investment Research has a buy call on the Reit but its $1.19 fair value estimate is under review.\n\nVoyage Research has kept its \"increase exposure\" call on the basis that the Reit's acquisition rate may outpace projection.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/science-saving-face", "site_title": "The science of saving face", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nThe science of saving face\n\nSpecialty unguents backed by celebrity doctors and cutting edge science seem to hold more clout in the competitive realm of skincare than a superstar ambassador or established brand name. By May Yip\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Mar 14, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n'DERMA skincare\", \"bioactive compounds\" and \"medi-aesthetics\" - the de rigueur buzzwords for the beauty business appear to be geared towards geeks with biomedical degrees rather than your average Jane, keen to banish a wrinkle or two. These days, rather than ads covered with the airbrushed visages of starlets, celebrity doctor endorsements, futuristic ingredients and products with names that sound more clinical than cosmetic reign when it comes to peddling jars of hope.\n\nWith lunch-time Botox injections and weekly laser treatments becoming beauty regimen fixtures, the growth in aesthetics treatments have in part led to a resurgence in cosmeceuticals - a loosely-defined skincare category that is projected to ring up sales of US$12 billion in 2015 in the US alone, according to a report by Research and Markets. And a recent study conducted by the International Society of Aesthetics Plastic Surgery revealed that Asia boasts the highest concentration of plastic surgeons by continent as well as the highest concentration of plastic surgery procedures carried out as compared to the rest of the continents. Non-invasive procedures also account for a large percentage of treatments carried out.\n\n\"Aesthetic treatments are an investment. To maintain the benefits of these treatments, it is important for patients to be on a strong maintenance programme,\" says David Colbert, a New York-based dermatologist whose clientele includes stars such as Naomi Watts and Rachel Weisz. \"My brand was created as a form of aftercare for my celebrity clientele. It was designed as the perfect complement to the Triad Red Carpet facial laser treatment but has been so successful that it has evolved to become a substitute for people who are uncomfortable with aesthetic procedures or who can't afford them.\"\n\nWhile on one end of the cosmetics spectrum are organic beauty marques, touting the use of all-natural ingredients and traditional remedies, high-tech potions are nevertheless leading the pack in the survival of the prettiest. Coined in 1980 by dermatologist Albert Kligman, \"cosmeceuticals are designed to have clinical benefits and are typically built around active ingredients that are supported by scientific evidence\", explains Dr Colbert. His cult, eponymous skincare label is available at upscale department stores and multi-label boutiques such as Barneys, Colette and Space.NK, as well as IYAC Aesthetics and Anti-Aging Clinic here at Camden Medical Centre.\n\nAnd he is not the only doctor to have lent his name and expertise to skincare ranges: Think successful cosmetics marques such as Dr Brandt or Perricone MD, or even a capsule range of products by Harvard-trained medical doctor and botanist Andrew Weil for plant-based skincare brand Origins. Closer to home, Georgia Lee who has been providing aesthetic medical services in her Holland Village clinic, boasts her own DrGL range of custom skincare for Asian skin, while medical director of Prive Clinic at Palais Renaissance, Karen Soh, also launched a skincare range, Prive Skinworks.\n\n\"People see results with aesthetics treatments and want similar results with their skincare products,\" says Dr Soh, whose products contain ingredients such as sodium hyaluronate which can hold up to a thousand times its weight in water to penetrate into and hydrate skin. \"They see skincare as a complement to their treatment or as home-care maintenance.\"\n\nEven beauty powerhouses such as L'Oreal have dedicated whole divisions to cosmeceuticals. Termed \"derma skincare\", such products from L'Oreal-owned brands such as Skinceuticals, Vichy and Laroche-Posay have been developed with the medical community and recommended by dermatologists and healthcare professionals. The skincare ranges are so popular that a standalone boutique, Professional Derma Center, was unveiled in Westgate Mall late last year to meet the growing demand from savvy shoppers. Specifically, the Asian market has been growing at double digits for the past five years, with Singapore considered as a mature Asia market for the category, says Annie Law, general manager of Active Cosmetics Division, L'Oreal Singapore.\n\n\"We have two main types of customers: The first consists of consumers who have specific needs - they usually have acne-prone, sensitive or intolerant skin types and are looking for products formulated with no paraben, alcohol or fragrance, which are safe to use and will not irritate skin or aggravate skin sensitivity,\" explains Ms Law.\n\n\"We also have a growing group that are seeking for high quality and value products; they usually wish to trade up from mass-market products.\"\n\nPriced from $18 to $335, these products may cost slightly more than those from the group's other drugstore brands such as L'Oreal Paris. But they also provide unique benefits: For example, the award-winning SkinCeuticals antioxidant ingredient C E Ferulic is clinically proven to reduce post-laser down-time - a relief for those who dread the raw-skinned effect following the popular aesthetics treatment.\n\nAnd as much as doctors are banking on cosmetics lines to widen their reach beyond the clinic, the Professional Derma Center aims to provide personalised services within the store - apart from simply dispensing beauty products. Trained consultants are armed with high-tech diagnostic tools to provide skin and hair advice, while an in-store medi-spa offers Skinceuticals facials. Previously, the treatments were only available at luxury outlets such as The Spa Artisan at The Fullerton Hotel.\n\nBut while multi-syllabic ingredients and clinical-sounding brand names may suggest credibility and results, Dr Colbert warns, \"cosmeceuticals are subject to the same image and marketing-based sales techniques that are found in cosmetics as a whole. In fact, there are many brands that leverage a physician's name without having a strong clinical story. It is important for consumers to take the time to understand the basics of dermatology so that they can independently evaluate the claims that are being made by marketers.\"\n\nFor example, in 2012, beauty giant Lancome was ordered to tone down an ad for its anti-ageing Genefique range by the US Food and Drug Administration. Claims that it \"boosts the activity of genes\" and will \"stimulate cell regeneration to reconstruct skin to a denser quality\" could only be made by a product classified as a drug, according to the US body. Not that the L'Oreal-owned brand was much affected by the slap on the hand, launching a new advanced formulation of the super-serum with 40 per cent more actives than its predecessor last year.\n\nAs Dr Soh elaborates: \"It's always important to read the ingredients of the product before you make the purchase. There are certain products that are controlled drugs and can only be sold with a prescription from the doctor and available at authorised clinics.\"\n\nUltimately, cosmeceuticals are targeted at \"consumers who are now better informed and more demanding\", says Ms Law. In other words, we expect a little more than sheer hope when we purchase a jar of the latest skin-saving salve.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A global surge in the demand for gas, led by Japan in 2011, boosted trade, tied vessels to longer routes and drove rental rates to record highs.\n\nBut the 119 new carriers ordered from 2011 will have expanded the fleet by over 30 per cent by end-2017. As tankers leave the shipyards, delays in construction of new LNG export plants and erratic global gas output have curtailed demand for them.\n\nEarnings have halved to around US$70,000 per day over the past year, leaving only a thin profit margin. Owners that relied on financing to buy new vessels may be barely covering their debt payments.\n\n\"Some of the highly leveraged owners dependent on spot or short-term business will be close to their breakeven costs at current rates,\" Erik Stavseth of Arctic Securities said.\n\nIndustry analysts warn of a still deeper slump ahead as attempts by owners to delay deliveries of new vessels could result in a surge of additional capacity by year-end. Thirty-two vessels were delivered to the global fleet this year, and another 63 are expected over the next two years.\n\n\"It is generally accepted that day-rates are not going back to 2011-2012 levels this year as there are just too many vessels available in the market,\" said Jon Skule Storheill, chief executive of Norwegian ship owner Awilco LNG. \"We need to see more LNG volumes on the water as well as some older vessels disappear first,\" he added.\n\nData from maritime analysis firm VesselsValue.com showed that 13 LNG tankers have been scrapped since 2010. Another 42, which are 30 years or older, are candidates for scrapping, Mr Stavseth said. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

The political stability that had developed in many of the region's economies by the 1980s and 1990s paved the way for these countries to industrialise and modernise in more meaningful ways.\n\nWhile Japan led Asia's economies in their race to first world status, Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan were not too far behind. Today, the rise of China as the world's largest trading nation and the modernisation processes in India and South-east Asia's populous nations make the Asia-Pacific a globally significant region.\n\nKey to the development of these economies is the strengthening of the region's corporate governance and investment landscapes.\n\nWhile Singapore has long boasted an enviable credit rating and stable economy that have made it a destination for investment and asset management, other Asian economies have also worked hard to strengthen their balance sheets and graduate to the \"investment grade\" club of nations.\n\nThe improved fundamentals have helped many companies, many of them with close ties to their host countries' governments, to embark on more sustained growth paths to meet growing market demand in their home markets and those of their neighbours.\n\nJust as importantly, this growth enables young Singaporeans to consider investment opportunities right at their doorstep.\n\nTwo sectors commonly associated with the growth of the region are resources and infrastructure.\n\nThe Singapore stock market continues to play a key role through listings involved in resource extraction, infrastructure provision, and companies or trusts in the industrialising parts of Asia-Pacific.\n\nThe region now makes up almost a third of the world's economy. Its share in the global pie has expanded from 21 per cent in 1980 to 32 per cent in 2013, and is expected to hit 34 per cent in 2018.\n\nUsing some simple extrapolations, the Asia-Pacific's share in the global pie could be 35 per cent in 2020 and as much as 38 per cent in 2030.\n\nThe past rate of growth has seen Asia-Pacific score an extra percentage point in the share of global growth every three years.\n\nInterestingly, it has not all been about developing Asia. Developing Asia contributed 32 per cent to Asia-Pacific's $2.3 trillion nominal gross domestic product (GDP) in 1980 and 56 per cent to Asia-Pacific's $23.5 trillion nominal GDP in 2013.\n\nHowever, Singapore more than doubled its contribution in the burgeoning Asia-Pacific economy over the period while Hong Kong was able to maintain its contribution.\n\nSince 1980, Asia-Pacific has seen periodical slowdowns, led by China in more recent years, as well as more economically buoyant times. Through these swings, the region has consistently continued to add to its economic impact on the world.\n\nDiversified stocks\n\nThe effect of regional financial hubs in facilitating trade and investment in the modernising region has seen Singapore and Hong Kong develop the most diverse stock markets in Asia.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, more than 30 per cent of all securities listed on Singapore Exchange (SGX) have their senior management located outside of Singapore.\n\nThey are located across 24 different countries. This includes 13 countries across Asia-Pacific.\n\nChanging the lens slightly to the annual reports of all securities listed on SGX reveals there are as many as 28 countries where the majority of their revenue is reported - this includes 18 countries across Asia-Pacific.\n\nSingapore also offers a significant level of diversification in the business focus of its securities with as many as 104 subsectors as categorised by the Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB).\n\nThe most heavily represented stock sectors are industrial machinery, real estate holding and development, heavy construction, food products and electrical components & equipment.\n\nSGX plays a key role in facilitating the industrial and economic requirements of the region through its stock market.\n\nMining, oil and gas\n\nThe mining, oil & gas (MOG) segment of the Singapore stock market is one of the most heavily traded and new listings last year increased the number of listings from 15 to 20.\n\nThree of these new listings took place on the Catalist board, which caters to the needs of fast-growing enterprises.\n\nA difference between Catalist and mainboard companies is that companies seeking a primary listing on the Catalist must be brought to list by approved sponsors.\n\nThe five MOG companies that listed last year are AsiaPhos, Wilton, KrisEnergy, Rex and Linc Energy. All five of these companies are involved in resources and have operations in the region or around the world, more so than in Singapore.\n\nAsiaPhos is listed on Catalist and last year became the first mineral resources company listed in Singapore solely focused on exploring and mining phosphate in China, with the ability to manufacture and produce phosphate-based chemical products.\n\nWilton Resources Corporation Ltd, formerly known as Hartawan Holdings Limited, is listed on Catalist and is an investment holding company.\n\nWilton Resources and its subsidiaries are engaged in the business of exploration, mining and production of gold ore in Indonesia.\n\nKrisEnergy is an independent upstream company focused on the exploration, development and production of oil and gas in Southeast Asia. KrisEnergy's target focus area stretches from the Surma Basin in Bangladesh in the west to the Papuan Basin in the east, and from offshore southern China in the north to Indonesia in the south.\n\nRex International is principally engaged in the business of oil and gas production and has concessions located in the Middle East, Norway and the United States .\n\nLinc Energy is focused on both conventional and unconventional oil and gas production. Linc Energy owns a diverse and substantial energy portfolio that includes oil, gas, shale oil and gas and coal in the United States, Poland, Uzbekistan, and Australia.\n\nWhile both Rex International and Linc Energy have their assets spread around the world, both companies chose to list in Singapore because of the city-state's reputation as an international energy hub.\n\nNote that like many resources companies, MOG companies do not initially generate revenues or profits. However, they may possess exploration and exploitation rights for potentially profitable discoveries.\n\nThe resource and reserve classification system is used to express the economic confidence in any particular mineral or oil and gas resource.\n\nMOG companies may undergo long periods of time without economic realisation, and may return to the market for several rounds of fund raising for further project development.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nBusiness trusts and real estate investment trusts (Reits) are becoming increasingly popular structures for delivering funding to infrastructure projects and evaluating the relevant assets. Business trusts focus on the value of an asset and its ability to generate cash. They are suitable vehicles for listing big ticket infrastructure assets that generate cash flow.\n\nThere is a large pipeline of infrastructure projects for Asia-Pacific.\n\nA couple of years back, consultancy McKinsey estimated the required funding at US$8 trillion up to 2021. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the most underserviced infrastructure in Asia is its roads and rail networks.\n\nOther capital raising methods for infrastructure include traditional listings of corporations, which generally come under the ICB categorisations of industrial transportation, telecommunications and utilities.\n\nUtilities are generally the most popular categorisation associated with infrastructure.\n\nIncluding companies that are classified as utilities by the ICB as well as those that report a majority of their revenue from the utilities sector, there are 15 relevant companies listed on SGX.\n\nThe FTSE ST Utilities Index was the best performing of the sector indices in 2013 with a 32.8 per cent price gain and a 14.8 per cent price gain in the 2014 year through to Feb 25, although it should be noted that this index is made up of only three companies.\n\nOutside the utilities sector there are companies that are involved in building infrastructure, which can be categorised by ICB to heavy construction, industrial engineering, industrial machinery, support services or technology, among others.\n\nMost of the Reits listed on SGX invest in industrial parks, commercial towers or shopping malls.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of the Reits listed on SGX own Asia-Pacific property assets outside of Singapore.\n\nHence the leverage, occupancy rates and distribution of rental income of a Reit is influenced by not just the growth of the Asia-Pacific, but supporting infrastructure such as roads, electricity, water and ports.\n\nThe first Reit was listed on SGX in 2002, and the now 26 Reits listed on SGX are distributing almost US$3 billion in dividends to unitholders on annual basis.\n\nLooking at Asia-Pacific as a whole, over the past 10 years, the number of listed Reits has quadrupled to over 150.\n\nLast year four Reits and three business trusts listed on SGX. The largest capitalised Reit to list was Mapletree Greater China Commercial Trust.\n\nIt was established with the strategy of principally investing, directly or indirectly, in a diversified portfolio of income-producing real estate in the greater China region, which is used primarily for commercial purposes (including real estate used predominantly for retail and/or office purposes), as well as real estate-related assets.\n\nOther Reits to list were SPH Reit, OUE Hospitality Trust and Soilbuild Reit.\n\nThe largest business trust to list was Asian Pay Television Trust, which became the first listed business trust in Asia focused on pay-TV assets.\n\nAsian Pay Television Trust's investment mandate is to seek investment opportunities to acquire controlling interests and to own, operate and maintain investment opportunities in mature, cash generative pay-TV businesses and broadband businesses in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore.\n\nOther business trusts to list were Croesus Retail Trust and stapled security Viva Industrial Trust.\n\nTo sum up, Asia-Pacific is made up of very different economies, which are all expanding and modernising.\n\nActivity in this region's capital markets over the next few years will be increasingly driven by the development of the resource and infrastructure sectors in these economies.

It helps to ensure that there is accountability to stakeholders and sustainability in the business.\n\nGood corporate governance practices are equally, if not even more, important for family businesses, since the overlap between family life and work life, and the rigidity of the family hierarchy, present challenges that are absent in non-family firms.\n\nFor some family firms, the irrational fear of losing control can be the main obstacle to the adoption of improved corporate governance practices. However, good governance principles can be of great help to family firms in dealing with two particular threats to their growth and continuity: internal conflicts and succession.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Companies & Markets\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nMalaysia has not found any evidence yet of illicit chip smuggling, minister says\n\nJul 15, 2025 01:43 PM\n\nNvidia to resume H20 AI chip sales to China in US reversal\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nIndonesia looking at levy on coal exports to boost state coffers\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:03 PM\n\nAsia: Markets mixed as China\u2019s economy meets forecasts\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:49 AM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n4\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\n5\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal", "images": []}

This is why companies tend to calculate the cost of replacing hard-disk drives (HDDs) in their data centres purely in terms of storage. However, Fusion-io believes that this mindset needs to change in order for enterprises to fully unlock the capabilities offered by flash memory in their servers.\n\nSpeaking to BizIT, Gary Orenstein, senior VP of products at Fusion-io, shared that one of the main challenges the company's sales people face when speaking to enterprise companies is highlighting the fact that incorporating flash memory in servers is not just to boost their storage capacity.\n\nIn other words, they need to go beyond thinking of it as a cost per kilobyte calculation for return on investment (ROI) purposes. Rather, enterprises should view adopting flash memory in terms of the cost of accelerating their mission-critical business applications and comparing it with existing performance, Mr Orenstein explained.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Technology\n\nSingapore ranks among top cities for tech talent as AI job listings surge globally: report\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:37 AM\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

With the manpower shortage in the food and beverage sector amplified by the government's recent tightening of foreign labour quotas, Mr Ng says that he would be looking at \"using more advanced technology to produce high quality food with minimum manpower\".\n\nBut his immediate plan after his departure is to first take a three-month holiday with stops in Penang, Hong Kong, London and Santorini, among other cities, before heading to Japan for three more months to further hone his skills. Drawing on his contacts there, he hopes to apprentice at \"a mix of traditional Japanese or French restaurants and modern dessert places\".\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n4\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\n5\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal", "images": []}

The guaranteed annual payment to SDC of $3.7 million, to increase 3 per cent each year, will continue for the length of the 60-year lease.\n\nThe Business Times understands that the total consideration falls between $100 million and $150 million.\n\nSharing the development plans for the site, Chng Kiong Huat, FEO's executive director of property services, said that The Outpost will feature a modern hotel with classic historical elements and architectural form. It will be completed in 2018.\n\n\"The architecture of what was once the Blakang Mati Artillery barracks and the Parade Square, along with heritage and protected trees in its environs, will be conserved and will breathe new life as a premium vintage hotel wing,\" he said.\n\nSpanning an area of about 484,400 square feet, the land parcel has a maximum permissible gross floor area of about 387,500 sq ft, subject to the payment of a development charge or differential premium.\n\nBT understands that the development charge is for intensifying the use of the site, should the developer max out the allowable plot ratio.\n\nFEO, the sponsor for the listed Far East Hospitality Trust, plans to offer The Outpost as a major pipeline project for the trust.\n\nThe developer trumped three other submissions to win the tender, during which the quality and pricing of each proposal was assessed.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In this case, the information we have forces us to look further and further afield.\"\n\nThe search has shifted westward since aviation investigators compiled signs the Boeing Co 777-200 veered off its route to Beijing and turned back over Malaysia, beyond the limits of the country's radar, according to two people who asked not to be identified because the probe is ongoing. Indian forces yesterday expanded the search for the missing airliner to the Bay of Bengal after evidence mounted the plane with 239 people on board may have flown long after controllers lost contact with it a week ago.\n\nA satellite transmitter on the plane was active for about five hours, indicating the plane was operational after its transponder shut down less than an hour after take-off, said three US government officials.\n\nInvestigators are studying four or five scenarios, including an explosion, intentional acts and actions performed under duress, Mr Hishammuddin said. The possibility of pilot and crew involvement was also being explored, he said.\n\nSpecialists from the UK and Rolls-Royce have said that they are studying the possibility of satellite communication with the aircraft and will share their findings with Malaysia, Civil Aviation chief Azharuddin Abdul Rahman said yesterday.\n\nAn Indian aircraft yesterday combed an area west of the Andaman islands, hundreds of miles off the intended flight path. A plane from New Zealand is scouring areas to the north-west of Malaysia, said Air Vice-Marshal Kevin Short.\n\nThe search by the Indian navy and coast guard is on the opposite side of Malaysia from the plane's intended path to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur. India was initially searching waters just north of Banda Aceh, Indonesia. The areas of search are being given by Malaysia, said Harmit Singh, a navy spokesman.\n\nMr Hishammuddin said that 57 ships and 48 aircraft are searching for Flight 370. South Korea is readying planes to help search for the missing jet, Defence Ministry spokesman Kim Min Seok said yesterday.\n\nThe US Navy is moving the destroyer USS Kidd from the Gulf of Thailand to the Strait of Malacca to help in the search, said Commander William Marks, a spokesman for the Navy's Seventh Fleet.\n\nIt also will move a P-8A Poseidon aircraft into the area today to rotate with a P-3C Orion craft that has been involved in the search, he said.

With a plot ratio of 1.4, it can yield a maximum permissible gross floor area of 35,595 square feet.\n\nKnight Frank, the site's marketing agent, assumes a $5.8 million development charge for redeveloping apartments with a gross plot ratio of up to 1.4, which translates to $1,430 per square feet per plot ratio (psf ppr).\n\nThe District 10 site offers double frontages of 42 metres' width onto both Queen's Road and Duke's Road.\n\nSince the three properties are owned by the same seller, Strata Titles Board approval is not required for the sale, which thus \"offers a quick turnaround time for prospective purchasers\", says Ian Loh, Knight Frank Singapore's director and head of investment and capital markets. He adds: \"We expect this property to attract strong interest in view of its strategic location and relatively affordable investment size.\"\n\nThe site is nestled in the school belt comprising Hwa Chong Institution, National Junior College, Nanyang Girls' High School and St Margaret's Secondary School.\n\nSeparately, Knight Frank is also marketing two adjoining ground-floor shops in Thomson Plaza with total strata retail space of about 14,000 sq ft.\n\nGuide prices range from $3,500 to $3,600 per sq ft.\n\nSale of the shops will be via Expression of Interest and is subject to the existing restaurant and lifestyle store tenants. The three-storey mall serves private estates such as Thomson Park and The Windsor, and public estates such as Ang Mo Kio and Shunfu.\n\nMary Sai, executive director of investment and capital markets at Knight Frank Singapore, believes that \"with the upcoming Upper Thomson MRT Station, the improved accessibility will enhance the value (of the retail space) in the long term\".\n\nThe Expression of Interest for the Thomson Plaza retail space closes at 3pm on April 8, and the tender for the Bukit Timah properties at 3pm on April 9.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

If successful, GGV will be able to manage more funds and \"issue larger cheque sizes to startups\", while it continues to offer mentorship and incubation services, he said.\n\nInsufficient Series A and post-Series A funding (Series B, C, etc), as well as corporate VC participation, were some of the challenges faced by entrepreneurs seeking to raise working capital in the past year, the Entrepreneurship Review Committee (EnRC) said in a report in January.\n\nThese led to what the EnRC termed the \"Valley of Death\", the period spanning the post-seed and growth stages where many startups wind up due to insufficient follow-on capital.\n\nBut Mr Lauria believes this trend is not all bad, and is in fact a function of Singapore's maturing startup ecosystem. \"The Singapore government has long focused on the pre-seed and seed stages, offering various grants and funds to early stage startups. Today, startups that have benefited from those schemes have reached the post-seed stage, and are thus looking to raise Series A funding and beyond,\" he said.\n\nMr Lauria is also confident more corporate VC investors will enter the field, given the increased presence of startups and global VC firms here. Last year, VC investment in Singapore's tech sector soared to US$1.71 billion from US$27.9 million in 2011, according to the Asian Venture Capital Journal.\n\nGGV, a partner incubator under the National Research Foundation's Technology Incubation Scheme since March 2012, has incubated 17 companies and created more than 338 new jobs in Asia.\n\nMeanwhile, Infocomm Investments Pte Ltd, the investment arm of Infocomm Development Authority, and Joyful Frog Digital Incubator said yesterday they would jointly run accelerator programmes for tech startups based here.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the medium to long term, its branding will take a hit from its association with the incident, he added.\n\nAt Dynasty Travel, the majority of its corporate travellers who are booked to travel on MAS over the next two weeks are already changing their travel plans in favour of other carriers.\n\nBut travel agency Chan Brothers, however, said it had not received any requests from customers to switch carriers.\n\nThe Beijing-bound MH370, which had 239 people on board, lost contact with Subang Air Traffic Control at around 2.40am on Saturday, about two hours after taking off from Kuala Lumpur.\n\nA search-and-rescue mission supported by a total of 10 countries continues to comb the waters where the South China Sea and the Gulf of Thailand meet for the missing Boeing 777-200 aircraft.\n\nMAS, which reported a loss of RM1.15 billion (S$444 million) for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2013, is likely to see its reputation take a hit as a result of the mishap, which has made headlines worldwide.\n\n\"At this juncture, there is a fear factor but with time, travellers will overcome this and tend to forget after a period of about six to 12 months,\" said Alicia Seah, director of communications at Dynasty Travel. \"But during this time, Malaysia Airlines will need aggressive efforts to rebuild trust and reputation.\"\n\nAnd this could include having to dangle promotional fares to lure customers when the embattled airline is already bleeding red ink.\n\nOne travel agent noted that other airlines could benefit in the short term from the knee-jerk reaction, just as travellers were equally spooked by Asiana Airlines' fatal crash in San Francisco last year, which also involved a Boeing 777.\n\nFrost & Sullivan's Mr Das reckons that the low-cost carriers in Malaysia may be able to further wrest market share from MAS, which is struggling on its home turf because of fast-growing rivals such as AirAsia.\n\nMeanwhile, search efforts for the missing plane continue, though there are more questions than answers at this point.\n\nIn a press release yesterday morning, MAS said: \"When the aircraft is located, a Response Coordination Centre (RCC) will be activated within the vicinity to support the needs of the families.\"\n\nMAS is also deploying an additional aircraft to bring the families of the passengers from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur today.\n\nOne theory reportedly being investigated is that the aircraft disintegrated mid-air, which would have spread debris out over a larger area and could explain why search efforts have failed to turn up any signs of wreckage thus far.\n\nIt has also emerged that two of the passengers on MH370 - which operated as a codeshare with China Southern - were travelling on stolen European passports, pointing to lapses in security procedures.\n\n\"I am still puzzled how come (immigration officers) cannot think: an Italian and Austrian but with Asian facial features,\" Malaysia's Home Minister Zahid Hamidi was quoted as saying.\n\nThe identity of one of the two has been confirmed, with the Malaysian police saying the suspect in question is not from Malaysia.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The company priced the offering at 900 yen per share, which puts the offering's total value at 318.5 billion yen (S$3.91 billion).\n\nThe company also cut the portion of the offering for overseas investors to 37.5 per cent from 45 per cent, with bankers noting concerns about its heavy dependence on Apple Inc's iPhones and iPads, which make up 30 per cent of its business, and declining screen prices.\n\nSmall and mid-sized screens are typically tailored to individual supply contracts, so prices are difficult to track, but NPD Display Search senior vice-president Yoshio Tamura said that the average price of five-inch screens for Chinese smartphone makers fell a steep 34.7 per cent from March 2013 to February this year.\n\nHe added, however, that the worst appears to be over. \"Since the drop in the latter half of 2013 was so great, we expect the price to bottom out,\" he said.\n\nJapan Display, formed in 2012 from the merger of struggling display units at Hitachi Ltd, Sony Corp and Toshiba Corp, last week set a range of 900 to 1,100 yen for the offering as it prepares for a March 19 listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.\n\nThat had already marked a modest retreat from a reference price of 1,100 yen announced with its original listing plan last month.\n\nJapan Display is offering nearly 60 per cent of its expanded share capital in the listing, which will also raise 126 billion yen from the sale of new shares, to fund spending on display manufacturing facilities. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nMalaysia has not found any evidence yet of illicit chip smuggling, minister says\n\nJul 15, 2025 01:43 PM\n\nNvidia to resume H20 AI chip sales to China in US reversal\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nIndonesia looking at levy on coal exports to boost state coffers\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:03 PM\n\nAsia: Markets mixed as China\u2019s economy meets forecasts\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:49 AM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM", "images": []}

And no debris has been spotted. All that has emerged are two oil slicks - one off Vietnam and the other, 145 km off the east coast of peninsular Malaysia.\n\nThe director-general of Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, described the incident yesterday as \"an unprecedented missing aircraft mystery\".\n\nMAS can ill-afford this crisis. It has announced three straight years of losses, culminating in a RM1.2 billion loss for its 2013 financial year - despite having undergone several rounds of restructuring and shedding \"unprofitable\" routes to Europe, the US, South America and even the Middle East.\n\nThe market's opinion of its stock has been brutal. The MAS share price has collapsed some 60 per cent since September 2011, which coincides with the time from which chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, who was from the power generation business, took the helm.\n\nThis could be why speculation about his longevity on the job has begun.\n\nHong Leong Bank, in a report released yesterday, said that it did not discount the possibility of changes at MAS's top levels, given the disappointing financial results, the severity of the current incident and last October's crash of a MASwings jet, killing three.\n\nMASwings is a regional airline running rural air services in East Malaysia.\n\nHong Leong Bank said, however, that it expected \"minimal expenses\" to be borne by MAS, and that the insurance companies would shoulder the costs. Even so, the bank affirmed its \"sell\" order on the airline, estimating a \"target\" price of 20 sen.\n\nThe reputational damage done to MAS could deepen, going by the note struck in Global Times, the Chinese newspaper close to Beijing. The following ran in a Malaysian news portal, citing Global Times' editorial: \"If it is due to a deadly mechanical breakdown or pilot error, then Malaysia Airlines should take the blame. If this is a terrorist attack, then the security checks at the Kuala Lumpur airport and on the flight are questionable. If it is due to some natural or uncontrollable factors, all airlines across the world, including Malaysia Airlines, should draw a lesson.\"\n\nFor MAS, much will depend on the outcome of the final investigations, but more immediately, the crisis will compromise its ability to increase yields. It will probably be forced to slash fares to ease passenger fears about safety.\n\nBut the crisis could also present opportunity. Shukor Yusof, a Malaysian aviation analyst at Standard and Poor's in Singapore, wrote this in The New Straits Times yesterday: \"But if there is any good that can come out of this sad event, it is this: it is a time for MAS and its shareholders to reflect and undergo self-criticism.\n\n\"The airline business is brutal. Money and time spent supporting an airline that continuously fails must cease. Take the first step. Make that change.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

China's Beijing Construction Engineering Group (BCEG) says that the project is the biggest in Britain since the 2012 Olympics and believes it could help move the centre of economic gravity away from London.\n\nLast October, BCEG announced that it would become a 20 per cent partner alongside construction group Carillion and the Greater Manchester Pension Fund to develop an \u00a3800 million (S$1.7 billion), five million square foot business district at Manchester airport, Britain's third busiest.\n\nIts choice of Manchester marks a departure from the path taken so far by most Chinese property developers, such as Advanced Business Park, that have headed first to the capital, where demand for space has stayed strong through the downturn compared to the rest of the country.\n\n\"The project itself by size is the biggest development project since the London Olympics . . . I think the way people do business in the UK, particularly in the north-west, will be changed because of this project,\" Xing Yan, BCEG International managing director, told Reuters.\n\n\"No one would deny that there are a lot of opportunities in London but if you study carefully, if you do your work well, there are opportunities everywhere.\"\n\nBCEG, which employs 20,000 people worldwide and worked on the 2008 Beijing Olympics' gymnasium venue, is being backed by China's biggest bank by assets, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, a source told Reuters in October.\n\nBritain has been trying to woo Chinese investment as part of plans to increase bilateral trade to US$100 billion by 2015. The Airport City deal was announced by finance minister George Osborne during a trip to China last year.\n\nLondon has often been accused of sucking up business and talent at the expense of other British cities, resulting in a local economy that has rebounded strongly since the financial crisis even as other parts of the country still grapple with high unemployment and slower house price recovery.\n\nThe value of offices, shops and industrial property across Britain fell as much as 42 per cent after the 2007 financial crisis. While London property has since recovered 41 per cent of its value, the rest of the country has only rebounded by 9 per cent, data from Investment Property Databank show.\n\nAnother British city, Liverpool, has pitched heavily for Chinese investment in recent years, proposing a 55-storey skyscraper to be called Shanghai Tower, which would be the tallest building outside London if constructed.\n\nThe Airport City consortium will visit Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen on June 9-13, Mr Xing said. He said that while the consortium hoped to attract Chinese firms from sectors such as technology and manufacturing, it would also market the scheme in other countries. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

The company has already been tightening its belt, announcing in January that it was eliminating 1,700 jobs at its aerospace division, mostly in and around its headquarters in Montreal.\n\nIt's also reducing training budgets and restricting business travel, encouraging employees to use videoconferencing instead, according to Isabelle Rondeau, a Bombardier spokeswoman, confirming the contents of an article that appeared in Canada's La Presse newspaper.\n\n\"Meeting our profitability goals is a priority,\" Ms Rondeau said. \"We've reached many milestones in the development of our new products, we have a substantial backlog, but now we have to deliver on our profit targets. That's the context for these measures.\"\n\nBombardier's widely traded Class B shares rose 0.4 per cent to C$3.61 at the close. That left the stock down 22 per cent this year, while the benchmark Standard & Poor's/TSX Composite Index rose 5 per cent.\n\nThe company has been bedevilled by four postponements of its CSeries jet, which chief executive officer Pierre Beaudoin is counting on to generate US$5 billion to US$8 billion of additional annual revenue by the end of the decade and help the company almost double sales.\n\nThe tardy commercial debut has inflated the CSeries programme's costs to US$4.4 billion, US$1 billion more than the company targeted when it decided to proceed in 2008. The plane will weigh on profit margins for the first two years after its commercial debut next year, executives said last month.\n\nEarnings before interest and taxes at the planemaking business will amount to about 5 per cent of revenue this year, down from an earlier projection for a 6 per cent margin, Bombardier said in its fourth-quarter earnings statement.\n\nFollowing the earnings release last month, Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's cut their corporate debt ratings on Bombardier one step to three levels below investment grade. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/more-patients-opting-stents", "site_title": "More patients opting for stents", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nMore patients opting for stents\n\nThree factors make percutaneous coronary intervention the preferred choice - advances in PCI techniques, high occlusion rates of bypass surgery, and advances in diagnostic methods and increased patient awareness\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Mar 7, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nFOR those with significant narrowing of one or more major heart arteries, opening of narrowed heart arteries using cylindrical metallic meshes (stents) that are mounted on balloons and inserted through 2mm plastic tubings via the wrist or groin artery under local anaesthesia is increasingly common. These stents are expanded and deployed at the narrowed heart artery segments and the entire procedure is called percutaneous coronary intervention or PCI. While performing PCI during an acute heart attack is undoubtedly life-saving, the data for those with blocked arteries but are relatively well or stable, is less robust.\n\nReducing deaths\n\nThe most important question is whether performing PCI in stable patients results in less death from heart disease. A recent February 2014 Circulation journal article by Mayo Clinic researchers on about 19,000 patients that had undergone PCI and were subsequently followed up for a long time sheds some light on this. These patients were followed up for almost two decades and by the end of the study period, 37 per cent of the patients had died. Death from heart disease decreased by 33 per cent but death from non-heart conditions such as cancer and other chronic diseases increased by 57 per cent. In this group treated with PCI, heart disease as a cause of death had gradually decreased in percentage over time.\n\nPCI resulted in reduction in death from heart attacks and sudden death, but did not decrease death from failure of the heart pump function. This was because failure of the heart pump can also result from causes other than blockage of heart arteries. This study based on real world data showed that PCI is beneficial for those with significant heart artery disease even if they are relatively well.\n\nTreatment options\n\nThe decision to treat a patient with severe blockage of his heart arteries with medication, PCI or heart artery bypass surgery is dependent on the patient's overall condition, complexity of his heart condition, facilities of the hospital, financial considerations and last but not least the experience and capability of their heart specialist. Over the past decade, the incidence of heart artery bypass surgery has been decreasing and that of PCI has been increasing. There are three major reasons for these developments. The most significant is that advances in PCI techniques and increased operator experience has allowed PCI for complex heart disease to be performed safely. In today's context, in experienced centres, PCI can be performed safely with good outcomes for most patients who have severe narrowing of all the three major heart arteries.\n\nRecently, an overseas patient, Mr A, who had multiple narrowed segments in all his major heart arteries had been offered heart artery bypass surgery in his country and sought another opinion after failing to get his doctors to perform PCI for him. He refused surgery and after careful assessment with the help of a computed tomography (CT) scan of his heart arteries, PCI was considered as an alternative option. A CT scan of the heart arteries offered significant advantage as it provided important data on not only the lumen of the heart arteries but also the extent of cholesterol and calcium deposits in the wall of the heart arteries; information that cannot be obtained from an invasive coronary angiography (ICA) performed by injecting contrast media into the heart arteries by inserting plastic tubings through the artery at the wrist or groin. The vital information provided by the CT scan enabled the procedure to be performed successfully and safely.\n\nAnother overseas patient, Mr B, had 100 per cent blockage of two out of three of his major heart arteries and 90 per cent blockage of the third heart artery and had refused heart bypass surgery. Meticulous and detailed study of the CT scan of his heart arteries provided important three dimensional images and cross sectional images of heart arteries; information that could not be obtained from the two dimensional ICA images. Careful planning allowed the PCI to be performed successfully with good outcomes. It has been more than a year since the PCI had been performed and Mr B is able to run on the treadmill machine without any symptoms. More importantly, a follow-up scan showed that all his heart artery segments that were opened had remained patent.\n\nBoth Mr A and Mr B had new generation bioabsorble polymer cylindrical meshes implanted into the heart arteries. In addition to having a new lease of life, they both will benefit from the ability to stop taking blood thinning tablets after six months and the multiple polymer \"stents\" in their heart arteries would have been absorbed by the body after three years, restoring their arteries to their natural state.\n\nThe second reason for the declining incidence of heart artery bypass surgery has been the sobering outcomes from real world data. The high occlusion rate of venous grafts have resulted in loss of benefit after several years when compared to those who have been treated with medication only. For example, data from the USA Society of Thoracic Surgery 1991 to 2007 database, published in the Circulation journal in March 2013, showed that for those 65 years or more who had undergone heart artery bypass surgery, the benefits were lost after several years when compared to those who were on medication only. In addition, only 20 per cent of the patients were alive after 18 years of follow-up, with about half of them dying from heart disease.\n\nThirdly, advances in diagnostic methods and increased patient awareness have also resulted in earlier detection of heart artery disease which are usually either treated with medication or PCI and do not require bypass heart surgery. Nevertheless, there will be patients who present late with severe disease that would require heart bypass surgery rather than PCI. Hence, while heart bypass surgery is less commonly performed for heart patients, it remains an important option.\n\nDifferent opinions\n\nHence, if you have been diagnosed to have severe narrowing of your heart arteries, scientific data shows that PCI can reduce death from heart disease in the long term. While bypass surgery seems to be beneficial for those with complex heart artery disease when compared to those on medication only, this benefit is gradually eroded over time. If all the three major heart arteries are severely narrowed, whether you undergo PCI or bypass surgery is not only determined by the detailed assessment of the heart artery disease but also by the facilities and experience of the centre. Hence, do not be surprised that if you present the same set of heart artery ICA films to different heart specialists, you may get different opinions.\n\nDr Lim is medical director at the Singapore Heart, Stroke & Cancer Centre.

The China property sector now accounts for some 40 per cent of Asia's two biggest high-yield debt benchmarks, the Merrill Lynch and the JP Morgan Asian Credit indices.\n\nChinese loan-seekers have enjoyed an additional benefit of borrowing overseas, as exchange rates have moved in their favour. However, the recent reversal in the renminbi has raised concerns over the rapid growth of unhedged foreign exchange liabilities for firms that generate all their income in local currency.\n\nAnalysts are warning that the overseas borrowing binge has become unsustainable. In a report published on Thursday, Standard & Poor's warned that sales revenues from the sector are no longer growing as fast as liabilities. \"Our ratings on these developers may face downward pressure as their debt increases may have outpaced property sales growth,\" said S&P's credit analyst Matthew Kong, referring to companies rated by the agency.\n\nThe renminbi has reversed course since touching a record high of 6.0395 against the US dollar on Jan 14, and slipped more than one per cent in seven days to 6.1718 on Feb 28. It has since rebounded to 6.1105, but the spike in volatility poses challenges for Chinese companies with foreign exchange liabilities.\n\nBetween Jan 1, 2012, and the same date this year, the renminbi rose 4.7 per cent, effectively reducing the total liabilities of Chinese developers in their home currency and making it easier for them to meet interest payments.\n\nAs an example, in their mid-year reports last year, Agile Property Holdings reported a gain of 348 million renminbi (S$72 million) from the effect of currency appreciation on its outstanding debt. China Overseas Land Investments recorded a HK$360.4 million (S$58.8 million) net foreign exchange gain.\n\nIt is no coincidence that these two firms are among the Chinese developers with the biggest exposure to foreign currency debt.\n\nAccording to analysts at Credit Suisse, China Overseas Land Investments tops the list with 87.2 per cent of its debt in foreign currencies, followed by China Resources Land (74.4 per cent) and Soho China (67.2). Kaisa Group (60) and Agile Property (56.6) are in the fifth and sixth position respectively, right after China Overseas Grand Oceans or Cogo (63).\n\nBecause of its high exposure to dollar-denominated debt, Credit Suisse calculated that a 5 per cent depreciation in the renminbi could increase the net gearing of China Overseas Land Investments by 28 per cent. The increase for Agile and Kaisa, two of the most frequent offshore bond issuers, is much worse: 104 and 76 per cent, respectively.\n\nCredit Suisse's piece also raised the alarm among investors and analysts over another issue: interest coverage.\n\nAlmost every single overseas bond from the Chinese property sector includes a limit on the fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures the number of times a company can meet its interest expenses through earnings and recurring income such as rental revenues. Such a clause is considered standard in the high-yield bond market.\n\n\"The depreciation of the currency could impact the fixed charge coverage ratio of these companies,\" said one high-yield analyst.\n\nRecent bond issues have come with lower ratios, giving developers more flexibility but eroding investors' protection. Evergrande, for one, recently amended the terms on its outstanding debt to reduce the fixed charge coverage ratio to 2.75 times.\n\nOthers, however, may already be nearing their limits, suggesting that any further depreciation in the renminbi could have a big impact. A traditional approach to calculating fixed charge coverage yielded a ratio of 2.91x for Kaisa Group, based on the company's full-year earnings report, released last Tuesday.\n\nKaisa's outstanding 8.875 per cent dollar bonds due on March 19, 2018, require it to maintain a minimum coverage ratio of 3x.\n\nThe covenants, however, require different calculations that usually yield higher ratios. Jim Cheung, Kaisa Group CFO, said that the company's fixed charge coverage ratio was above 3x as at Dec 31, 2013. \"It is very difficult to calculate the FCCR of a PRC property issuer based on only public information,\" he said.\n\nMr Cheung also stressed that falling below the threshold would not trigger a default.\n\n\"Even in case a company's FCCR is below 3x, it does not necessarily mean the company is in breach of covenants under most, if not all high-yield indentures in the PRC property sector,\" he said. \"Kaisa has adequate headroom in terms of debt incurrence to support its . . . expansion.\"\n\nWhile analysts and portfolio managers agree that a more volatile renminbi could impact the interest coverage of Chinese developers, they do not expect the effects of the most recent currency move to have a material impact on income statements.\n\nOne analyst noted that most of the companies in the sector are reporting earnings this month for the period ended Dec 31, at which point the renminbi was traded at 6.056 to the dollar, a record high. \"By the time they report mid-year earnings, the renminbi will have appreciated again,\" he said.

This means that after the purchase, the units are leased back to the hotel management. The owners get 40 per cent of the gross revenue generated by their units.\n\nBanyan Tree said the suites will thus be run with the objective of maximising investment returns for buyers:\n\n\"The resort, upon completion, targets to command benchmark room rates in Penang ranging from US$210 to US$1,600 per night.\"\n\nBanyan Tree has other sale-and-leaseback deals with hotel rooms in Malacca and Phuket.\n\nOwners of the units in the Angsana Teluk Bahang in Penang are automatically enrolled in an exchange programme called The Sanctuary Club, which qualifies them to exchange 15 days of their annual stay-entitlement for a complimentary stay at any destination within the Banyan Tree network.\n\nThey are also given discounts and privileges in accommodation, wellness facilities, restaurants and merchandise.\n\nThe Angsana Teluk Bahang resort sits on 3.2 ha of land in Teluk Bahang, a small town on Penang island. It has a gross development value of RM500 million, with a built-up area of 615,000 sq ft, excluding the parking area.\n\nThe development, which falls under Banyan Tree's Angsana brand, will comprise three main buildings with around 300 sea-facing rooms and suites with direct beach accessibility.\n\nIt will also have three swimming pools, five food-and-beverage outlets, 12 double spa-treatment rooms, and 12,000 sq ft of retail space.\n\nBuilding is slated to start in June, with the first phase expected to be ready in December 2016.\n\nExhibitions are being held today and tomorrow at the Grand Hyatt Kuala Lumpur to market the suites, and on March 29 and 30 in Singapore's Four Seasons Hotel.\n\nKnight Frank is the exclusive agent for the sale of these units.\n\nThis launch comes just over a week after Banyan Tree announced that it was working on Laguna Shores Bintan, a development which signals its foray into the market for lower-priced holiday-home projects.\n\nThe Bintan development will be completed in 2016.\n\nBanyan Tree has existing retail projects in Lijiang, China, in Lang Co, Vietnam, as well as in Cabo Marques and Mayakoba, Mexico.\n\nIts counter closed unchanged at 63.5 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/designs-business", "site_title": "Designs on business", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nDesigns on business\n\nAn emerging design culture here makes the Singapore Design Week a timely initiative, writes TAY SUAN CHIANG\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Mar 6, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nFIRST, there was Singapore Fashion Week. Then Art Stage and its peripheral events raised the profile of art buying in Singapore. Now, Singapore design is in the limelight with a brand new festival that takes design out of the drawing studio and into real life.\n\nSingapore Design Week (SDW) 2014 kicks off on Monday until Mar 16 with an activity-packed schedule that has no less than 50 local and international design events taking centre stage at the brand new National Design Centre in Middle Road and elsewhere around the city.\n\nWhether you're a furniture or product designer, a house proud aesthete looking for the next conversation piece, or just anyone who likes pretty things, the SDW aims to please with its combination of both commercial and consumer interests. Scale-wise, it's the biggest such event so far, with the DesignSingapore Council joining forces with the Singapore Furniture Industries Council (SFIC) and DesignS - a collective of industry players - to play up the role of design in business and society, and bringing Singapore closer to its target of being Asia's design hub.\n\nThere's no better time than now to hold a festival like this, says Jeffrey Ho, executive director of DesignSingapore Council. \"There's an emerging design culture in Singapore; people are much more design conscious; plus the prevailing global emphasis on design as a key economic factor.\"\n\nBefore SDW, the council's main interest was the Singapore Design Festival, which ran biennially from 2005 to 2009. It was a council-led event which provided a platform for Singaporean and international design communities to get together to network and share idesa.\n\nWhile the festival was well received, Mr Ho says, \"We wanted to rethink and be more targeted based on the Council's long-term plans to evolve the design landscape.\" Those plans include showing how design can play a part in growing businesses, as well as raising design awareness in Singaporeans.\n\nSDW is therefore bigger and more ambitious in scope, thanks to the collaboration with SFIC and DesignS. Under the umbrella of SDW, Singaplural - a design event started three years ago to encourage brainstorming among design players in advertising, architecture, interiors and furniture design - will become the anchor event.\n\nDesign Council's Mr Ho adds that this symbiotic collaboration allows them to organise activities and events to benefit all parties across the board - from designers and businesses to students and the public.\n\nFor example, there is the first Singapore Design Business Summit, organised by the Design Business Chamber Singapore. Its president, Tai Lee Siang, says that top management folks, business owners, design practitioners, students of design and any organisation that uses design should attend the summit. \"This is an opportunity to hear speakers share their success stories and challenges about how design can be used to enhance business,\" he says.\n\nTo further push the idea of collaborations between different associations, the Chamber is working with the Singapore Institute of Landscape Architects, Interior Design Confederation Singapore and SFIC for its summit lectures. \"The variety of topics under the design umbrella becomes wider, covering landscape architecture, interior design and furniture design,\" says Mr Tai.\n\nHe adds that SDW presents the best opportunity for a multi-purpose platform to stage all the various programmes specifically made to highlight the value of design to businesses. He points out the close correlation between design and profit. Using Apple as an example, which has increased its revenue by 1200 per cent since 2000, Mr Tai says, \"It's not just clever marketing or prudent financial moves; clearly the success is defined by excellent design solutions.\"\n\nHe adds, \"holding the event annually will serve to anchor the value of design, and design industries firmly in the minds of businesses and the society at large.\"\n\nApart from targeting enterprises, key events during SDW also reach out to industry players. A new addition on this year's calendar is Maison&Objet Asia, an off-shoot of the highly successful Parisian home furnishings trade show.\n\nTaking place from March 10 to 13, this first Asian edition will see 265 brand exhibitors from 24 countries, of which 30 per cent are from Asia Pacific.\n\nMaison&Objet's managing director Philippe Brocart says that Maison&Objet Asia taking place during SDW will \"help to attract more people to the show.\" He does not think the show will come in competition with the other stalwart - the 33-year-old International Furniture Fair Singapore which runs from March 13 to 16. \"Maison&Objet and IFFS have different profiles but they will be complementary,\" says Mr Brocart.\n\nSimon Ong, chairman of design development at SFIC and SingaPlural 2014, says that from the industry's standpoint, \"it is good to have more design content and events. Maison&Objet Asia is a very different event from IFFS. There can be room to co-exist and develop synergy to propel the industry forward.\"\n\nWhile pushing the idea of design and business, as well as reaching out to industry players are important, getting the man-in-the-street interested in design is also one of the goals of SDW.\n\nMr Ho says the line-up of events and activities have been planned to cater to even those who are not designed trained. He cites Design Trails: Creative Circuits as an example, where shuttle buses will ply two routes to bring visitors to design studios and stores.\n\nEvents under the SingaPlural umbrella are also meant for the public. One highlight is 30 LifeStories, held at Dhoby Ghaut Green and the National Design Centre. Here, old logs salvaged from parks around Singapore are given a new lease of life as park installations. Then there is also Design Larger Than Life, a series of outdoor installations where public interaction is encouraged.\n\nThe highly anticipated Furniture Design Award, which attracts regional and international design talents to work in Singapore and also acts as a launch pad for creative and innovative designs in Asia, will also be returning this year.\n\nDepartment store Robinsons Orchard is also jumping on the design bandwagon this year for SDW. A team of designers will be transforming a glasshouse into one filled with Swarovski crystals in 48 hours as part of a window display competition. Local design firm Hjgher will create an interactive window display.\n\nInside the store, it is collaborating with Maison&Objet to show pieces that reflect the Singapore home.\n\nFrank Kraatz, Robinsons' managing director says \"design has always been a part of Robinsons' DNA. With the pivotal role that Maison&Objet plays every year in the global design scene, our collaboration epitomises our commitment to showcasing the best of design here in Singapore.\"\n\nEven though there have been smaller design-related events held over the past year, design folks welcome the start of SDW.\n\nDesigner Edwin Low who runs Supermama says, \"in a way SDW can be seen as an \"official week\" to house all design activities together. So yes, it is long overdue.\"\n\nJoel Leong from Haystakt, an online retailer for design and craft says that, \"with a small domestic market, it is great to have marketing-geared events like these to bridge the design community and the public. I think whether it will be successful or not depends on the level of public involvement and engagement, because an audience is required in order for designers to attempt to make design accessible.\"\n\nFor designer Pann Lim from Kinetic, an event such as SDW \"will always be beneficial to the design scene no matter what, because more designers are involved. With more participation, the network in the industry becomes more intimate. Involvement from international designers also gives SDW more depth and breadth.\"\n\nHe adds that, \"with time, the general masses will be more exposed to design culture. And, of course, the desired results will be like-minded people looking forward to SDW.\n\nDesign practitioner Lee Weiming, however, hopes that there will be more hands-on workshops in future editions. He finds that SDW is packed with talks and workshops that are too theoretical. \"Hopefully there can be workshops, especially those by younger designers, that allow them to express themselves through their work.\"\n\nHe adds that workshops that are more hands-on and that allow the public to understand the design process, or even a visit to a factory to watch how furniture is conceptualised and built, and workshops that allow participants to use design tools, would help them better appreciate design.\"\n\nMr Ho says that he hopes SDW will be able to attract more than 15,000 participants and visitors. \"Beyond the numbers, more importantly, we hope to deepen the level of engagement with our audiences.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

From last month, the re-classified Cat A also limits engine output to 97 kW or 130 hp.\n\nThe move is to ensure that luxury models stay out of this traditional bread-and-butter segment and that soaring premiums are deflated.\n\nAs for Cat B, it is now for cars above 1,600cc or 130 hp.\n\nLooking at car registration data in February - the first month since the re-categorisation of Cat A and B cars - the LTA says that there has been a significant decrease in the median open market value (OMV) of cars registered in Cat A, as well as a greater number of cars with a lower OMV registered in this category (see table).\n\n\"The objective of the re-categorisation was to ensure that Cat A better achieves its original social equity purpose of serving mass-market car buyers, in view of the rising proportion of higher-end cars appearing in Cat A in recent years,\" LTA said in a statement yesterday.\n\nIt pointed out that the median OMV of cars registered in February - using Cat A COEs obtained after re-categorisation - fell by 28 per cent to $18,845, compared with $26,147 for COEs obtained in the preceding six months (August 2013 to January 2014).\n\n\"Correspondingly, there were more cars with lower OMV registered in Cat A using COEs obtained after the re-categorisation, compared to those registered using COEs obtained in the six months prior to re-categorisation,\" said the LTA.\n\nTwo highlights from the data reveal that the proportion of cars with an OMV of $15,000 or below has tripled to 25 per cent after the re-categorisation, while those with an OMV of $20,000 or less has more than doubled to 56 per cent.\n\nThe LTA also noted that other social equity elements in its car ownership policies include the tiered Additional Registration Fee (ARF) structure introduced in March last year.\n\nThis means Cat A cars generally have \"significantly lower statutory costs\" than Cat B cars.\n\nThe total statutory cost payable for a Cat A car was $98,769 on average compared to $148,250 for a Cat B car, based on registration data from August 2013 to February 2014.\n\nBut one motor dealer said that the re-categorisation has not completely eliminated luxury cars from Cat A.\n\n\"Mercedes-Benz is still in this category with its CLA, A and B-Class cars, while Audi has the A3,\" he said. \"That is one of the reasons why the gap between the Cat A and Cat B premiums is not wider.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He said yes. 'Well, I am a better builder than I was 10 years ago'.\"\n\nMr Snyder, who formed his first company when he was 19, is persevering after surviving some tough economic cycles. During the recession in the early 1990s, \"suicide became an option\", he said, as values plunged on properties with millions of dollars of his personal guaranties. Six decades after entering the business, he's about to sell his latest apartment project and intends to use the proceeds on new office buildings.\n\n\"I have been hearing more and more, 'I need more space',\" Mr Snyder said. \"When you get the 'I need more space' in more than one of your buildings, you know things are getting better. It's time to build.\"\n\nMr Snyder said he is planning a US$70 million office project on Vine Street in the Hollywood section of Los Angeles, which he will start building later this year even without tenant commitments. He also said that he expects to start a US$100 million building on Wilshire Boulevard, in addition to a US$138 million Hollywood office development that's already been announced.\n\nRising rents\n\nLittle office space has been added in the area in the past five years, putting Mr Snyder ahead of the curve, said Todd Doney, vice-chairman for brokerage office services at Los Angeles-based CBRE Group Inc.\n\n\"We are in the early stages of the office recovery,\" Mr Doney said. \"As long as we keep the economy plugging along and can continue modest job growth, the office market here should continue to improve.\"\n\nAverage monthly asking rents at Los Angeles County office buildings climbed to US$2.63 per square foot last year, up 2.3 per cent from 2012, according to CBRE. Rising rents have spurred an increase in construction, with 1.3 million square feet of office space under development, the most since late 2008, according to the brokerage.\n\nHigher rents are driven in part by demand from entertainment and technology companies in areas such as Los Angeles's Westside, where asking rents were US$3.62 on average, CBRE data show.\n\n\"We saw a rise in activity towards year-end for a number of reasons, including an increase in confidence by some Los Angeles area companies as the national economy continued its modest recovery,\" said Mark Sullivan, executive vice-president at New York-based commercial real estate services firm Studley Inc.\n\nMr Snyder last month broke ground on the US$138 million Hollywood office project without tenant commitments, aiming for entertainment and media-related clients. His other speculative office development in the area will be a 107,000-square-foot building on Vine across from the W Hollywood hotel, he said. He is awaiting final regulatory approval and expects to begin construction in September.\n\n\"The office market was hit hard during the recession,\" Mr Snyder said. \"But it's pretty strong now in pockets. In Hollywood, for example, we're right in the middle of post-production and all the ancillary businesses. It's booming.\"\n\nSome of the biggest issues facing Los Angeles office developers are the slow growth in rents and the uneven recovery, according to a fourth-quarter report by tenant representative Studley.\n\n\"Other than a couple of larger renewals and some significant healthcare leases, fourth-quarter leasing in most of the market was once again lacklustre,\" the firm said. The the majority of \"employers plus particularly traditional-space users - remain cautious and focused on cost containment.\"\n\nShrinking space requirements by tenants are adding to high vacancies, according to Mr Doney of CBRE. Vacancies of 15.9 per cent remain close to their decade peak of 16.4 per cent, from 2010, CBRE data show.\n\n\"People are continuing to expand the 'free address' concept, meaning you're not building out space with the one-desk-per-employee concept,\" Mr Doney said. \"So as tenants might sign leases, they may find they can make do with 60 per cent of the original space. The question for developers has to be, will this continue at the pace it's at, or is the pendulum swinging too far and will it mellow out again?\"\n\nKilroy Realty Corp, a Los Angeles-based owner of commercial real estate along the West Coast, last month said it plans to develop a US$300 million office-and-apartment project in Hollywood after acquiring land from the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, bringing the real estate investment trust's commitments in the area to about US$800 million.\n\nBuild-to-suit project\n\n\"When you go to invest in a speculative office development, you are still more out there on the risk curve,\" said Steve Reents, Seattle-based vice-president of acquisitions at Bentall Kennedy, a Canadian real estate investment adviser. Mr Snyder got a US$95 million construction loan for his Hollywood office project from a fund advised by the firm.\n\n\"It was particularly important to work with a partner with a deep connection and reputation in the market and one with a strong vision of the current and future market place,\" Mr Reents said. \"Jerry has that.\"\n\nOn the Miracle Mile stretch of Wilshire Boulevard, Mr Snyder is planning a build-to-suit project - a model of which, complete with a replica of a mammoth drowning in the La Brea Tar Pits, sits on his conference table - for a client he wouldn't identify. The 13-storey building would sit next to his existing property at 5757 Wilshire Blvd, which is almost fully leased.\n\n\"I build everything, but I love office,\" Mr Snyder said. \"I enjoy office because I'm dealing with business people - with professionals.\"\n\nProceeds from Mr Snyder's 464-unit apartment complex in Koreatown may total US$310 million, GlobeSt.com said on Jan 29, citing industry experts it didn't name.\n\nMr Snyder is planning to start marketing rental units at the project, called The Vermont, in early March, and put the entire development up for sale with the help of broker Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. Neither Mr Snyder nor Jones Lang would comment on the potential price.\n\nThe property, which Mr Snyder spent US$190 million to build using a US$65 million loan from Bentall Kennedy, has received \"a lot of interest\" from potential buyers, including US real estate investment trusts and investors from Asia and Europe, he said. Mr Snyder has shown the complex more than 20 times and expects a deal within 45 days.\n\n\"He's been a developer that has been able to see the future and execute on that,\" said Bruce Korter, director of real estate at Washington Capital Management. The Seattle-based firm manages investments for union pension funds in the state and was the lead equity investor in Mr Snyder's Vermont project. He wouldn't disclose the size of the company's investment.\n\n\"He's gone through hard times and good times, and has come up a survivor,\" Mr Korter said. \"We have a lot of faith in Jerry and are looking to do more business with him.\"\n\nBorn in Brooklyn in 1930, Mr Snyder broke into real estate as a general contractor working with his father. They moved to the West Coast when Mr Snyder was a teenager and, at 19, he founded his own company, L. Snyder & Son, eventually buying an empty lot and building his first house.\n\n\"I loved it,\" Mr Snyder said. \"I was the producer, the director and the screenplay writer. That's when I decided I wanted to be a developer.\"\n\nHe went from building one house after another to 500 at a time and, by the age of 22, was written up in The Wall Street Journal for being one of the youngest large-scale builders, developing 2,000 houses a year.\n\nSingle-family homes\n\nMr Snyder, who's lived in the Bel Air neighbourhood of Los Angeles with his wife, Joan, for 32 years and also owns houses in Montana and Rancho Mirage, California, focused on building single-family homes across the United States for three decades before entering the commercial real estate business in 1977 and ultimately focusing on Southern California.\n\nAfter expanding his real estate projects - including his development of the Water Garden office complex in Santa Monica, and 10 high-rise condominium buildings next to the Hotel Coronado in San Diego County - he almost \"lost his shirt\" with US$144 million of personal guaranties given during the rapid appreciation of property values in the 1980s that then plunged during the US recession of the early 1990s, following the collapse of the savings-and-loan industry.\n\nMr Snyder, who continues to arrive at his office at 9am most days, said he has since improved his financing strategies, keeping the leverage on his buildings manageable and focusing on cash flow and costs. He won't give personal guaranties again, he said. By the time of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's 2008 demise and subsequent market crash, he had refinanced most of his properties and reaped profits from selling some of his buildings.\n\n\"This last downturn we kind of skipped,\" Mr Snyder said of his company, where one of his three children also works. \"But back in the '90s, I remember sitting on the weekends with my wife, and praying, 'Please get me out of this one'.\" Mr Snyder remains optimistic about development possibilities in the region today.\n\n\"There's an old joke about a golfer,\" he said. \"He's had a terrible day. So he goes into the locker room and cuts his throat. When his friend comes in and says, 'You want to play tomorrow?' he holds his throat and says, 'What time, Charlie?' It's just like that for me. I see things coming my way, and I say, 'Sure, I'll look at it'.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

Over the past four years, Pimco's flagship emerging market (EM) local currency fund grew to more than US$12 billion from US$1.5 billion as investors, desperate for high-yielding exposure to Brazil, Mexico, Russia and Turkey, showered the fund with cash.\n\nNow, investors are pulling their money out of this and other emerging market bond funds, as across-the-board selling by market heavyweights such as Pimco prompts others to follow suit. Economists and regulators fear that the result could be a system-rattling bond market tantrum.\n\nIn a paper presented on Friday at a conference in Manhattan, four influential economists with roots in Wall Street, academia and the Federal Reserve warned that regulators had done little to prepare for such an outcome. The paper was discussed by a panel that included Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, and Jeremy C Stein, a governor at the Fed.\n\n\"It's the size of these inflows that is unprecedented,\" said Hyun Song Shin, a financial economist at Princeton and the incoming head of research at the Bank for International Settlements, the policy and banking outfit based in Basel, Switzerland, that caters to global central banks. \"Because the Fed's policy has been maintained for so long, the pile of firewood has grown to a very large size.\"\n\nThe notion that a bond market tantrum, if it lasts long enough, can lead to a broader economic crisis that reaches beyond its original locus is not without precedent. The debt crisis in the eurozone got its start when bond investors began selling Greek government bonds. Whether an investor retreat from these markets starts a brush fire, as was the case last summer and earlier this year, or a wider conflagration remains to be seen. There are those who say that the fairly muted effect of the recent emerging market hiccups is proof that the investor exodus need not become a cataclysmic event.\n\nThis year, investors have pulled out close to US$40 billion from emerging market funds, according to the fund tracker EPFR Global - a figure that is fast approaching the US$51 billion that left these markets last year. Some of the most pronounced outflows have come from local-currency bond funds, which absorbed significant amounts of hot money during the liquidity boom. During a period when the Turkish lira, the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso were increasing in value - in line with surging economic growth - these local-currency funds invested in high-yielding government and corporate bonds and became the most popular funds for those seeking a maximum return.\n\nAs currencies such as the real and the lira have begun to wobble, the rush for the exit has become all the more hurried. In the last six months, for example, Pimco's local bond fund has lost about US$1.5 billion, reducing its size to US$10.7 billion. In the last two months alone, the fund has lost US$900 million. What worries Prof Shin and his co-authors is that this selling begets more of the same. Long-term investors, who in theory should act as a counterweight in such periods of panic by buying when others sell, are doing the opposite and heading for safer shores along with the rest of the market. This fear of \"being the last one into a trade\" could possibly \"set off a race among investors to join a sell-off in a race to avoid being left behind\", the authors of the paper conclude.\n\nAs Prof Shin and his co-authors point out, there is no regulatory mechanism in place that could, if needed, step in to address such a situation. No doubt, the International Monetary Fund would get involved, but addressing a market panic reaching from Rio de Janeiro to Beijing would be the most complex of tasks. The solution, they argue, is fairly straightforward: The Fed must remain vigilant in resisting pleas to halt its policy of tapering bond purchases.- NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom: survey\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

It's all Ethan Renner (Costner) has known for the past 32 years as a high-calibre hit man. \"When you work for the agency it becomes your whole life,\" he sighs. Not any longer. Ethan wants out, now that his medical report has come back negative and he can't get rid of the crippling pain in his head.\n\nWhat's more, he wants to use the few months he has left to reconnect with his rebellious teenage daughter Zooey (Hailee Steinfeld) and reconcile with his wife Christine (Connie Nielsen). When Christine goes away on a business trip, Ethan seizes the opportunity to quit the killing and ease back into life as a proper dad.\n\nThen his CIA contact Vivi (Amber Heard) reels him in with an experimental drug that may or may not save his life. The snag: he has to locate an evil enforcer known as the Albino (Tomas Lemarquis) and kill his boss the Wolf (Richard Sammel). Worse, he can't even control Zooey. Oh, and there's a family of African squatters in his apartment.\n\nCostner isn't the first gun-toting avenger to roam the streets in the City of Light. 3 Days to Kill is simply the latest in a long line of action-movie specimens to use Paris as a beautiful co-star.\n\nHardly surprising, of course, given that the film, directed by McG, is based on a story by Luc Besson and written by Besson with Adi Hasak. The same Monsieur Besson has his hand in the Taken and Transporter series, so any similarities are purely intentional.\n\nRating:\n\nC\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nLifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}

The counter's only trade made in February was executed with a single lot changing hands at 2.1 cents, sending the counter down a whopping 22.2 per cent from its last traded price of 2.7 cents in December. Now, it is puzzling why someone would want to spend $21 of capital on a trade when minimum broking costs are $25, but the counter has to be kept alive somehow.\n\nLuckily, our other illiquid, loss-making micro-cap, health supplement distributor Jacks International, saw five lots traded at 6.5 cents in a single day in February. This was the stock's only movement for the month with a value of just $325, but it was enough to send the counter up 6.6 per cent for the year.\n\nDiversification is good. We countered one penny stock's plunge with another penny's rise. (Maybe this is what a certain minister means by \"upturn the downturn\". Just kidding.)\n\nMeanwhile, all three shipping-related stocks in our portfolio posted stellar stock performances. Offshore support vessel maker Nam Cheong, a hot favourite among brokers, is up 7.9 per cent for the year. Last week, the company reported good full-year results and doubled its dividends. Shipbuilding margins were 21 per cent in the fourth quarter in 2013, ahead of consensus, noted broker DMG & Partners.\n\n\"We continue to like Nam Cheong for its strong growth, low valuations, high return on equity, strong order win momentum and orderbook, and asset-light strategy and business model,\" it said, as it raised its target price to 48 cents based on 10 times forecast 2014 earnings.\n\nSingapore Shipping Corporation broke out of its half-year trading range towards the end of February to close at a seven-month high of 23.5 cents at end-February. Earlier in the month, the company reported that net profit was up 28 per cent at US$2 million and revenue was up 70 per cent at US$8.6 million for its third quarter ended Dec 31, 2013. This was due to the company having acquired terminal operations and logistics businesses last April. \"The group is optimistic to expand and build up an even younger fleet with quality long-term charters,\" it said.\n\nMeanwhile, container ship operator Rickmers Maritime made fourth-quarter losses due to impairment charges, but maintained its distributions and said the trust was \"operationally robust\". It continues to trade at a dividend yield of about 10 per cent.\n\nElectronics manufacturer PCI Limited reported an 83 per cent improvement in second-quarter net profit for the period ended Dec 31, 2013, to US$2.6 million. It was helped by higher-margin products shipped and lower operating costs, but cautioned that it was entering a seasonally low-demand period in the next six months, with no clear sign of sustainable global growth.\n\nFellow electronics play AEI Corp, which makes precision aluminium extrusion products, reported a 59 per cent decline in net profit for 2013 to $2 million, and halved its dividends. It was hit by weak global personal computer demand.\n\nChina-based plastic package maker Southern Packaging Group also reduced its dividend payout, having reported weaker sales and profit for its 2013 financial year.\n\nMeanwhile, OCBC Bank overcame lower life insurance and trading income to report stronger 2013 results, and said net interest margins should remain stable. The deadline for it to negotiate an exclusive deal to acquire Hong Kong's Wing Hang Bank has been extended to the end of this month.\n\nFinally, the privatisation of Indonesia-based financial firm Malacca Trust Limited was approved by Singapore Exchange (SGX) on Feb 19. The company has been replaced by another randomly picked counter, with buy-in prices pegged at end-2013 to facilitate easier reporting. The new counter is environmental firm ecoWise Holdings. More on that next time.\n\nOverall, the fund remains stable, though it, like the STI, is underperforming world stocks. Both the S&P 500 and the MSCI World indices hit all-time highs at end-February, as developed markets shrugged off emerging market worries and a depreciating Chinese yuan. Where stocks are concerned, nobody likes Singapore that much, still.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/transport-logistics/rising-offshore-challenge", "site_title": "Rising to the offshore challenge", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nRising to the offshore challenge\n\nShipowners are opting more for quality and durability in the building of their vessels than cost, reports MALMINDERJIT SINGH\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Mar 4, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nCHINA is slowly losing its competitiveness as a low-cost shipbuilding destination for the offshore and marine industry.\n\nMoreover, with serious shipowners opting for quality over price, Chinese shipyards are likely to up their game as they can no longer compete on price alone.\n\n\"The Chinese yuan continues to strengthen against the US dollar and Chinese labour costs continue to rise faster than in many South-east Asian countries. The Chinese yards are thus trying to move up the value chain as the Korean and the Japanese yards did a generation ago,\" George Horsington, president of business development at Jaya Holdings, told The Business Times.\n\nDespite credit tightening in China, yards there are still able to offer attractive financing terms to shipowners for new builds.\n\n\"Chinese yards do have access to state bank financing unlike yards in Singapore and the Batam cluster. We have seen payment terms offered between the conventional 20:80 payment schedule as low as 5:95, which is unsustainable and exposes owners to issues with delays and corner-cutting,\" Mr Horsington adds.\n\nSuch compromises on quality and delivery schedules force many shipowners to look away. Mr Horsington explains that \"state bank financing is likely to be more attractive to smaller, less established players, and is only part of the reason owners choose a yard\".\n\nLarger offshore and marine companies take a different view on contracting Chinese yards to build their vessels.\n\nMr Horsington observed: \"A lot of the top-tier owners in the offshore sector have very strong balance sheets and are more concerned about timeliness of delivery and quality of build rather than cheap credit. Some players have large contingent liabilities from the payment terms offered in China by yards which ought to be factored into their balance sheets when assessing credit quality.\" In Singapore, the decision among shipowners to continue building with Chinese yards seems to be split along the lines of quality versus price.\n\nTechnical support\n\n\"Each owner (in Singapore) has their own strategy. I think some owners have been burnt in China and would be reluctant to return. Others place cheap build cost above all else, especially if they are not long-term owners and operators of the vessels,\" said Mr Horsington.\n\nRegardless, industry players here still play an important role in the life cycle of a vessel built in China. According to Mr Horsington, most new builds from China come to Singapore for post-delivery work because the technical support available for offshore vessels in Singapore is much better than in China. This is because Singapore is positioned as the predominant Asia-Pacific hub for equipment manufacturers across the board.\n\nThe decline in appeal of Chinese yards is also due to another factor which affects demand for cheaper vessels. Since about 2009, a glut in the traditional shipping industry has seen more shipowners and shipbuilders make a transition to the more profitable and dynamic offshore and marine vessels segment. Even so, this trend has declined as a result of several push and pull factors.\n\n\"I think the recent recovery in bulk and tanker rates is reducing this trend as traditional blue water cargo vessel orders have recovered,\" suggested Mr Horsington.\n\nFurthermore, challenges existed for those shipbuilders who made the switch, and this eventually turned them away.\n\n\"A lot of yards in China have tried moving into offshore and suddenly realised that it was much harder than they expected. Offshore vessels are small, complicated and very, very, specialised compared to tankers, bulkers and container vessels. The skills required to build the two categories of vessels are very different - cargo ships are about fabricating steel at the lowest cost per tonne; offshore vessels are about the value-add from special equipment such as cranes, dive systems, anchor handling winches and multiple cargo capacities. There is much more emphasis on electrical systems and automation in offshore vessels than in conventional, and more stringent requirements for fit out,\" he explained.\n\nEven though some of the Chinese yards may have made incremental improvements in quality, they still lag behind their competition in the region in this aspect. \"I think Singapore and Batam cluster yards still offer excellent quality, after-sales service and on-time delivery, which can offset improvements in China,\" Mr Horsington noted.\n\nIndonesian yards, in particular, have risen in quality, said Mr Horsington, whose company Jaya Holdings itself has built its vessels in its Batam yard.\n\nThe Batam cluster has demonstrated its excellent commitment to quality, but most Batam-built offshore support vessels (OSVs) work outside Indonesia. We have vessels we have built in our Batam yard on hire to major international oil companies such as Statoil and Anadarko, which demonstrate that Batam yards can produce to the highest standards.\"\n\nIndonesian industry players, though, admit that the shipbuilders in their country cannot compete with China on pricing.\n\n\"Indonesian shipyards for new building have never been price-competitive compared to China because of the taxes that apply to the shipbuilding industry (in Indonesia), even though we still have an advantage of a relatively low-cost labour. The only shipyards in (Indonesia that) have tax-free advantage is Batam as they are part of the free trade zone in Indonesia,\" Nova Mugijanto, CEO of the Pan Maritime Group, told BT.\n\nThis was reiterated by Djoni Sutji, president of PT Indonesia Bulk Carrier. \"Indonesian shipyards are not as competitive to build a new ship compared to China or other countries that have incentives from the government. With the (raw) material almost all imported, and with no tax incentives, it is not really competitive yet to build a ship in Indonesia.\"\n\nEven then, Mr Mugijanto, who is also the offshore marine division head at the Indonesian National Shipowners Association, added that shipowners looking to build small to medium-sized vessels with relatively not so high technology, may yet achieve cost advantages building in Indonesia.\n\nMr Sutji agreed that the Indonesian yards were more cost-effective for Singapore shipowners in building smaller and simpler vessels.\n\n\"It is dependent on the shipowner's requirement, but some still prefer to build in Indonesia for not too high-tech ships or smaller ships,\" he said.\n\nHe explained that this was because it was more convenient and cheaper for Singapore-based shipowners to monitor the progress of their vessel in construction and for smaller vessels, this factor weighed in favourably in its cost-benefit analysis. For bigger or high-tech vessels, such as large bulk carriers and LNG ships, Mr Sutji admitted that shipbuilders, including from Singapore, prefer building in more experienced and sophisticated yards in Japan, China, Korea and Singapore.\n\nCabotage law\n\nHowever, industry players in Indonesia are optimistic that more shipowners from Singapore will increase their shipbuilding in Indonesia due to a new local content rule that the Indonesian government is implementing, in addition to a cabotage law that has already somewhat benefited the industry.\n\nFor starters, the cabotage law allowing only Indonesian-flagged vessels in the country, has helped improve the quality of shipbuilding in the yards there, revealed Mr Mugijanto.\n\n\"Because of the Indonesian cabotage policy since 2005, there are an additional 7,200 Indonesian-flagged vessels. Currently the total number of Indonesian-flagged vessels has already reached 13,224 units. Even though the majority are second-hand vessels, with the repair activities being done in Indonesia. So the ship repair business is booming. Because of that, the shipyard has the ability to improve their quality both for repair and new building.\"\n\nHe believes these standards in Indonesia will increase as more ship orders come in from Singapore due to the new local content rule. \"Currently, the Indonesian government is trying to increase and boost 'Local Content'. Upcoming new build vessels, which are purchased using government funds, must be built in Indonesian shipyards. These include tankers for PT Pertamina, RORO Vessels for the Sea and Communication Department, Patrol Boats for the Customs, small and medium-sized OSVs for Indonesian oil and gas companies.\"\n\nThese rapid developments, including the trends of shipowners picking quality over price and traditional shipbuilders leaving the offshore and marine sector, will cause structural changes in the segment going forward, Mr Horsington pointed out.\n\n\"The offshore segment has always been very competitive and both in terms of shipowners and shipyards building in the sector, the market is very fragmented. We would expect to see more consolidation on both the yard front and the owner/operator front.\"\n\nAnother trend the industry veteran, who had spent 15 years with Swire Offshore Pacific before joining Jaya Holdings in 2012, pointed out was a potential change in the type of fuel and vessels the sector is likely to see going forward.\n\n\"The most likely trend in the OSV sector is going to be a move towards dual-fuel, LNG-powered hybrid vessels. LNG is going to take off as a source of fuel (in the sector). As a result, vessels will get larger to accommodate the extra tanks required. Diesel will not disappear but charterers will want to have the LNG option.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The conducive business environment and tax regime, political stability and Singapore's growing status as a key regional financial hub are strong attributes embraced by the ultra-wealthy in Singapore and in Asia.\"\n\nOverall, however, the UK is the top location for a second home, followed by Singapore, the US and Australia.\n\nIndividuals considered to be of ultra-high net worth are those with net assets of at least US$30 million excluding their home.\n\nThe survey, launched jointly with the Bank of Singapore, involved 600 private bankers and wealth advisers.\n\nThe results represent the views of more than 23,000 ultra-high net worth individuals worth US$68 million on average. In aggregate, the clients held some US$1.5 trillion in assets.\n\nKnight Frank Asia-Pacific head of research Nicholas Holt said that there are some risks to residential property. One is the potential for higher interest rates. \"If inflation starts to pick up . . . if (the US) unemployment drops further, we could see sooner-than-expected rise in interest rates.\"\n\nFor now, while the Federal Reserve has embarked on a tapering of quantitative easing measures, interest rates are not expected to rise until around 2015.\n\nA second risk is political, and this includes further measures to dampen house prices. Dubai, for instance, has imposed mortgage restrictions.\n\nIn the report's global cities survey, which tracks the cities of most importance to the world's wealthiest, London retains the top spot this year, followed by New York and then Singapore. In 2024, however, New York is expected to take top spot, followed by London.\n\nSingapore is expected to drop to fourth place, and Hong Kong, to rise to third. Shanghai is also expected to rise by a notch to fifth. By 2024, six out of the 10 top cities will be in the Asia-Pacific region, compared to five now.\n\nBooming Asian markets dominate this year's Prime International Residential Index. Jakarta heads the index with annual growth of 38 per cent, similar to the rate it recorded in 2012. Bali took third place with a gain of 22 per cent.\n\nChinese markets also staged a recovery last year.

The request also includes US$64 billion for research and development, or US$8.8 billion less than forecast, according to internal budget figures.\n\nThe Navy's request also will include US$2.1 billion for a new class of aircraft carriers, funding research and procurement for the Gerald R Ford and John F Kennedy vessels, an increase from US$1.6 billion this year and US$781.7 million in fiscal 2013, according to Navy budget figures. Carriers are built and refurbished by Huntington Ingalls Industries.\n\nIn presenting his budget outline last week, Mr Hagel said that current plans foresee the Navy keeping 11 aircraft carrier groups. That may decline to 10 groups because plans to refuel and overhaul the ageing George Washington will have to be cancelled unless automatic budget cuts, known as sequestration, are eased for future years, he said.\n\nOn the Littoral Combat Ship from Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed and Henderson, Australia-based Austal, Mr Hagel barred planning for any more than 32 of the vessels, 20 fewer than the Navy's US$34 billion programme goal. He instructed Navy Secretary Ray Mabus to review the ship's performance and to prepare alternative proposals for a small combatant vessel \"generally consistent with the capabilities of a frigate\". Mr Hagel set out options including a completely new ship design, existing vessels including the Littoral Combat Ship or a modified version of it.- Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

This year's rout from Argentina to India won't prompt the company to scale back its commitment to the group of countries, Mr Andersen said.\n\n\"I will travel a lot to emerging markets this year, which is where the biggest opportunities for infrastructure investment are,\" he said. His company employs 89,000 people in 135 countries. \"I was in Africa for a few weeks earlier this year and have scheduled travels to China and South America. Our investment strategy will focus on these growth markets. We have to think counter-cyclical.\"\n\nInvestors have fled emerging markets this year as the US Federal Reserve pares its record stimulus measures. A slowdown in manufacturing in China and political unrest in Ukraine have added to the uncertainty. Global investors pulled US$3 billion from emerging-market funds in the week ended Feb 26, the 18th week of outflows, according to Citigroup, which cited data from EPFR Global.\n\nAn exit by short-term investors from emerging markets will help buyers such as Maersk generate bigger returns, Mr Andersen said. \"In general, these financial investors tend to settle for lower returns than we do; we want double-digit returns.\"\n\nMaersk's investments last year included container terminals in Brazil, Mexico and Russia and building up its oil exploration business in offshore Angola.\n\n\"When we invest in a port in a growth market, we spend a mix of the local currency and US dollars, so in the short term, our investment costs may be a bit lower,\" he said. \"And when the port is up and running, we tend to get payments in dollars in the transport industry, so in that way, we're pretty well covered.\"\n\nMaersk is planning to shift some investments to its oil, ports and drilling businesses and away from its container line division, which has been hurt by overcapacity in the industry.\n\nMaersk's earnings before interest and taxes fell to 9.46 billion kroner (S$2.2 billion) for the fourth quarter, the company said last week. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM", "images": []}

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/economists-divided-over-reit-impact-business", "site_title": "Economists divided over Reit impact on business", "publish_date": null, "content": "Economists divided over Reit impact on business\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Mar 5, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] Calls in Parliament for the government to rein in industrial and commercial rents or reverse JTC's land divestment programme to \"buy back some of the Reits\" have sparked mixed responses from market watchers, with some in agreement and others cautioning against tinkering with free market principles.\n\nA decade ago, JTC divested most of its industrial property, saying at the time that the move would create a more open and vibrant market by giving the private sector more freedom to operate flexibly to accommodate industry needs.\n\nOn Tuesday, however, Member of Parliament Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio) called the divestment \"a mistaken policy\" during the Budget debate. \"The government lost the ability to influence rental prices resulting in developers and investors (including Reits) making the money - this is passive income and not productive income benefiting the investors,\" he said.\n\nIt's a debate that has been cropping up in recent years as businesses reel from rising costs. Some economists agree that Singapore has over-embraced its free market approach and needs to recalibrate, especially with the proliferation of real estate investment trusts (Reits).\n\nIrvin Seah of DBS, for instance, feels that Singapore has overdone what it set out to achieve and should backpedal. He believes that a sizeable amount of commercial and industrial property should come under government control to serve as a benchmark for the market.\n\n\"Right now, what we have is an oligolopolistic structure, with a small group of players in this market, which makes it prone to price rigging,\" he said.\n\n\"It is not so much about bringing prices down, but about ensuring that we have a lever on certain scarce resources (such as land). The Reit model may work in big countries with ample land but less so for land-scarce Singapore.\"\n\nYet, others found Mr Singh's suggestion too \"drastic\" and \"excessive\". They warned against being too quick to point fingers at Reits as the culprit for rising business rents. Rather, they suggested that it could be a case of supply lagging demand.\n\nCIMB economist Song Seng Wun said: \"Everyone forgot while squabbling on the ground level who's to blame, but if you take a few steps back, it is because there is plenty of demand for space out there. Economics 101: this allows landlords to yank up rentals.\"\n\nIn this case, solving the supply problem may prove more effective. Patience is also needed because physical completion of properties takes time, he said. It may even be a good problem to have if landlords have no difficulty finding tenants for commercial and industrial spaces as this may mean Singapore has been successful in attracting businesses that want to expand here, he added.\n\nSeveral commercial and industrial Reits that BT contacted did not want to comment, but an industry player who declined to be named said that Reits themselves also face the same problems of rising costs that tenants face, including labour (for security guards and cleaners, for instance), land rents and property taxes, which help to justify rent adjustments.\n\nThat is not to say that profit is not on Reit managers' minds when they revise rents. It is the landlords' playground now, and they are motivated to maximise their return on investment, given that they are listed vehicles and answerable to unitholders, said the industry player.\n\nThis leads them to raise rents when they think the market can take it, while taking care not to tip the balance, lest their tenants pull down their shutters and leave, which is not in their interests either.\n\nFor Reits, the question is \"how much can you push prices before businesses need a breather?\", noted CIMB's Mr Song.\n\nOn Monday, Nominated MP R Dhinakaran also warned of the danger of the speculative element in commercial and industrial property. \"An asset value being pushed higher by several times makes little sense with no significant underlying change to the value offered to (the) tenant . . . If the asset value is fuelled by trading on a speculative basis without any underlying benefit changing (such as higher traffic for the tenant), it is bound to disrupt economics for the operating business,\" he said.\n\nBut the industry player pointed out that JTC has tightened conditions on lease assignments to discourage \"flipping\" - such as implementing longer prohibition periods before sellers can sell the property, as well as a longer minimum occupation period for anchor tenants in sale and leaseback programmes.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Interplex customers include names like tech giant Apple, auto suppliers Bosch, Denso and TRW, and car manufacturer Continental.\n\nIt is in supplying to the auto industry that the greatest benefits of the deal can be found, Amtek chief executive and chairman Daniel Yeong told The Business Times yesterday.\n\n\"Customers who asked us to build car steering columns for them also want us to build modules, connectors that we don't know how to do. Now, customers will be very happy because we are truly end-to-end,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the precision-engineering sector in Singapore had been too dependent on the HDD market. This market has been on the wane along with the personal computer market, with mobile devices gaining prominence. Asian precision-engineering firms have also centred around HDD manufacturing, he said.\n\n\"One of the things we had to do was to take this company out of hard drives and out of the Asia market. China is also not going to be the world factory for everything because costs are rising,\" he said.\n\nWith Interplex's factories being in places like the US, Mexico, India and Hungary, Amtek will become a truly global firm, Mr Yeong said. Amtek's network now spans China, Vietnam, the Czech Republic, Malaysia and Singapore.\n\n\"Customers want us to be where they produce and where they sell. So we need to add the US, we need to add Mexico to address the Latin American and South American market; India is important as an alternative to China, and we also need a good presence in Europe,\" he added.\n\nAmtek's acquisition will also mean it will now have global sales of about US$1 billion. \"If you're smaller, the customer is also afraid to put too many eggs into a small company. We've crossed the psychological barrier of US$1 billion in revenue to do business with larger customers.\"\n\nInterplex Industries was founded some 56 years ago by chairman and chief executive Jack Seidler, now 88.\n\nIn the six months to last Nov 30, Interplex generated revenues of US$182.4 million and pro forma Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) of US$16.5 million. Amtek is thus acquiring Interplex at around five times Ebitda - a multiple that Mr Yeong said was hard to go lower. \"Some transactions are happening around us at seven to eight times, so five is a good price,\" he said.\n\nThe acquisition will be funded mostly by debt. Net debt is expected to rise from US$41.6 million to US$233.9 million. Gearing thus jumps from 24 per cent to 134.6 per cent. \"This gearing level is still considered quite good. Most companies who are very aggressive will gear up to 300 to 400 per cent. For us, keeping it below 200 per cent is important,\" Mr Yeong said.\n\nAs an illustration of the financial effects, earnings per share for Amtek are expected to grow from 4.93 US cents to 5.18 US cents after the deal. Upon approval of Amtek shareholders and regulators, the deal is expected to be completed in the second half of the year.\n\nAmtek shares closed at 54 cents, up 1.5 cents or 2.9 per cent, before the deal was announced.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We have been advocating adjustments to the PIC scheme so that it is more accessible to local SMEs. Therefore, we are very pleased with the introduction of PIC+ as there is now finally a tax incentive targeted specifically at SMEs.\n\nHowever, even more can be done to simplify our tax regime. We ought to adopt a principle-based approach and move away from prescriptive rules so that businesses can access available benefits more easily. We were also hoping to see a tax allowance for self-generated brands to address the tax disparity between brand purchases and developers.\n\nAs an individual taxpayer, I am very impressed with the generous Pioneer Generation Package.

The best part of this is the promise of support being funded regardless of future economic conditions. It is such forward thinking, fiscal discipline and willingness to shoulder responsibility that has distinguished Singapore for half a century.\n\nAs for tax measures, the improvements to the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) and financial services sector are important. Productivity and innovation remain at centrestage, with the PIC seeking to entice businesses to improve. Some may be disappointed that there were not more tax measures to boost business. This is not surprising - Singapore's tax system is already competitive. The main reason that businesses want to be here is favourable infrastructure in the broadest sense - stability and the rule of law, education and skills, transport and communications.\n\nWhat is needed are further adjustments towards greater simplicity, transparency and certainty on the tax front. These need not be part of the annual Budget process but instead a continual process of incremental improvement.\n\nDora Hoan\n\nCo-Chairman/Group CEO\n\nBest World International Ltd\n\nOUR collective wish for the extension of the PIC was heard and granted in the Budget. In addition, we will get to enjoy higher tax deductions with the expenditure limit being raised from $400,000 to $600,000. This is greatly beneficial to raising productivity.\n\nBesides the PIC, the Infocomm Technology (ICT) for Productivity and Growth Programme (IPG) will be helpful for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to improve their technology.\n\nHowever, companies are unique and hence, the \"proven solutions\" may not be suitable for some. While they can try to pilot new solutions, the risks and resources involved may be too high. Perhaps the government may wish to review this policy more.\n\nThere is another measure that stood out - the increase in employers' contribution to CPF. This is good for employees but costly to employers. Nevertheless, we are glad that this will only be implemented from next year, giving us enough time to plan our budgets.\n\nRod Rodericks\n\nVice-President and Managing Director, APAC\n\nZebra Technologies\n\nTHE government's continued investment in its productivity-driven restructuring of the economy is a positive sign for Singapore. In Budget 2014, the government has identified ICT as being critical in enabling businesses, particularly SMEs, transition from labour-driven to innovation-driven growth.\n\nFacing challenges such as the manpower crunch, rising cost and growing competition, businesses need to leverage on technologies such as the Internet of Things to gain greater visibility and better business agility with a smaller but smarter workforce.\n\nFor example, by equipping their workforce with mobile point of sale (POS) systems and integrating smart tags to their stocks, retailers can significantly streamline and increase the accuracy of inventory and payment processes. On this front, initiatives which encourage the adoption of proven solutions and the development of emerging technology within the IPG and PIC schemes will play a significant role in helping Singapore SMEs make the productivity leap.\n\nYeoh Oon Jin\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nPwC Singapore\n\nMOST of the measures proposed in the 2014 Budget focus on assisting SMEs to increase productivity and innovation. Singapore-based companies are also encouraged to expand overseas. These are necessary moves and should be applauded.\n\nHowever, I feel that more could be done to anchor greater investments by foreign multinational corporations (MNCs) into Singapore. While there has been much global rhetoric about low tax jurisdictions, Singapore remains an exception because of our location as a strategic hub in this region and globally, and has also grown to be an attractive and very liveable city. This has encouraged many MNCs to locate their C-suite and key assets in Singapore. We must continue to enhance this unique position with pride.\n\nSingapore should continue to encourage foreign MNCs to increase their footprint in Singapore. The Budget should have included further measures to incentivise MNCs to bring greater and real economic activities, assets, etc into Singapore that can withstand scrutiny from any domestic or foreign interest groups.\n\nIn parallel, the Budget could also have been more innovative by introducing other self-compliance measures even though Singapore has already committed to meet international standards through greater transparency and exchange of information.\n\nMy hope is that we can take some off-Budget measures to do so.\n\nTim Moylan\n\nPresident, Asia Pacific\n\nInfor\n\nTHIS year's Budget includes strong incentives for SMEs to raise productivity, innovation and competitiveness - thereby the extension of the PIC scheme to 2018. By leveraging initiatives that encourage investment in technology, SMEs will be in a better position to seek new business growth opportunities and creatively solve common challenges faced in today's resource-constrained world.\n\nInvesting in enterprise resource planning solutions will help SMEs improve efficiency and cost effectiveness as it allows them to have better insight into internal operations and costs as well as the foresight to enable better planning. In short, the opportunity to work smarter by harnessing technology enables SMEs to level up the playing field and be better poised to compete with the larger players. SMEs who understand that technology is not just a tool for large corporations can better streamline business processes to achieve that competitive advantage, and become stronger in the long run.\n\nHugues Delcourt\n\nCountry Executive Singapore & CEO Private Banking Asia & Middle East\n\nABN AMRO Bank NV\n\nWHAT stood out most about the 2014 Budget was its focus on quality sustainable growth while building a fair and equitable society. From the pioneer generation that shaped what Singapore has become to supporting aspiring companies set to shape Singapore's future, there was something for everyone.\n\nFor our business, this year's Budget aimed to continue strengthening the competitiveness of the financial sector and create a stable business environment in Singapore. While we welcome the extension of productivity and tax incentive schemes, it would have been good to see even greater enhancements or new initiatives to address the main concerns for businesses in Singapore - rising operating costs and a tightening labour market. We need to continually improve Singapore's attractiveness as a global financial hub and key destination for foreign investments. In today's ever-changing global environment, there a greater need now than ever before to set Singapore apart from our peers.\n\nWhile the focus continues on building Singapore's enduring competitive advantage, I would also welcome continued support from the government for arts and culture funding, which is an important soft aspect for the well-known Singapore brand. We are pleased to see that Singapore's arts and cultural landscape has flourished and grown significantly over the years, and our bank welcomes this encouraging trend. At ABN AMRO, we will continue to play our part to support relevant arts and culture initiatives to engage different stakeholders in our local community.\n\nPhilip Yuen\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nDeloitte Singapore\n\nTHE 2014 Budget is a balancing act as the government strives to achieve sustainable wage increases and increased standards of living. While the employer CPF rate hike for 55-year-olds and above was largely anticipated, the increase across the board was a surprise and will increase employment costs. While the government will subsidise half the increase in 2016, employers nonetheless will bear the full cost thereafter.\n\nThe big Budget winners are SMEs, as targeted measures like PIC+ and various financial supports are structured to help them grow, expand overseas and invest in productivity. Enterprises will need to be proactive in investing and taking advantage of available schemes. For SMEs still struggling to get by, more assistance to facilitate business consolidation to cope with transformation would help.\n\nFor the Budget to achieve its intended effects, there must be change in social norms and attitudes. This mindset change will not be easy, but is necessary.\n\nStevan Hoyle\n\nPresident of Asia and Africa\n\nVodafone Global Enterprise\n\nACCORDING to the 2014 Budget, healthcare costs will be one of the main drivers of higher social spending in the next 10-15 years as Singaporeans age and the need for quality care increases.\n\nTo address the challenge of providing quality affordable care, the healthcare sector can leverage new Machine to Machine (M2M) and SMS technologies that enable healthcare practitioners to use mobile services that are prevalent in today's society.\n\nM2M can free up valuable resources for the healthcare sector by extending the reach of care beyond the hospital as patients will be able to receive care in their homes. For patients, M2M allows them to be connected to their healthcare provider in ways that weren't previously possible and provides the peace of mind of constant monitoring and support via wireless mobile devices.\n\nThe government's focus on improving the affordability of health care, coupled with the healthcare sector's adoption of the latest in ICT technologies, can provide Singaporeans the quality care they need and deserve.\n\nCraig Tegel\n\nRegional President\n\nAdobe Japan and Asia Pacific\n\nA COUPLE of initiatives stood out for us in the 2014 Budget - mainly the focus on the education system, ICT as well as innovation - and at Adobe, we are firm supporters of all the three focus areas.\n\nEducation plays a critical role in moulding our young and preparing them for the future. As the Budget highlights the government's support for early adopters of ICT, the implementation of such solutions will need to be a focus in the education sector. There is a need for today's educators to develop more engaging curriculum for digital-native students as the ways of teaching and learning have evolved drastically over the years, thanks to the explosion of mobile devices. With the introduction of ICT solutions in the classroom, we believe that this will have a positive impact in not only fostering collaboration and innovation among students but also enabling them to discover new ways of learning. Students can in turn take these skills with them as they enter the workforce and contribute to Singapore's economy.\n\nMichael Cornwell\n\nVice-President, Asia Pacific & Japan\n\nPure Storage\n\nSINGAPORE'S goal of becoming Asia's innovation hub requires moving beyond just a hub for large multinational industries to focusing on developing local SMEs. The Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) of Singapore has set its sights on solving this by building talent and adopting technologies that can help SMEs become more productive to stay competitive in our current economic climate.\n\nThe IDA investment in subsidised Fibre Broadband connectivity is an important first step but only removes one bottleneck impacting these SMEs today. The key investment that companies need to be looking at is storage - all flash storage in particular, to enable true growth and innovation.\n\nFor years, storage functionality has been a limiter on what companies can do with the data they have at hand. Back then, we simply could not cope with the complexity and amount of information needed to make business decisions. Today, the demand for instant access to data for making business decisions has been solved elsewhere by not just high-speed connectivity but advancements in storage technologies such as all flash storage that remove the storage complexity and bottlenecks for these SMEs.\n\nThe PIC scheme and IDA's IPG programme in particular will push the envelope on investing in emerging solutions that enable data analytics. Through this, it will enable companies in Singapore to increase their productivity and efficiency.\n\nI strongly believe that the day will come where companies realise the endless possibilities that data analytics can provide them, with storage not as a limiter but an enabler of value to their business and their customers.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPlan-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\nTHE Pioneer Generation Package in the 2014 Budget is extraordinary and revolutionary. It marks a significant shift in the government's efforts to tackle social problems. It will be remembered for a long time to come, by the pioneers, as they will benefit from it throughout their lifetime, as well as the younger generation, as the burden to support the pioneers has been eased.\n\nIn particular, the increased focus on health care for the pioneers is highly commendable, as this is where they need the most help to stay healthy and active in their golden years. However, health care should not just be the responsibility of government. Industry can also participate and contribute to health care, especially in the current situation where demand is outstripping supply of services.\n\nThis undesirable situation is due in large part to the ageing population and entrenched consumer behaviour - for example, the tendency to go to A&E without ascertaining the need. There is also increased urgency to achieve better healthcare delivery in the new continuum from primary care in acute hospitals, to step-down care in community hospitals, and to home care.\n\nIt would therefore have been more complete if the 2014 Budget had introduced incentives to harness more private sector participation. Businesses and entreprenuers can complement the government in tackling the many challenges facing health care in Singapore. Such incentives and/or subsidies can encourage and support the private sector to expand capacity and to enhance capabilities, for example, in harnessing IT in the provision of telehealth services for triage management, chronic disease management, wellness management and help for caregivers.\n\nJessie Quek\n\nCountry General Manager\n\nLenovo Singapore\n\nTHE $500 million grant for the IPG scheme will definitely be a great help to many local businesses. It will give these companies access to the latest technologies without burdening them financially, and help them leverage these to support their business needs. In addition, it enables them to stay competitive given Singapore's increasingly fast-paced and global business environment.\n\nOur workers today, while continuing to work hard, understand the need to work smarter too. Available technologies on the market today such as smart connected devices - from tablets to smartphones to laptops - as well as cloud storage solutions, provide workers with the perfect tool for staying productive, anytime and anywhere. This, in turn, benefits both companies as well as the employees.\n\nWith technology fast becoming a necessity for the workplace, programmes which encourage technological literacy will be a great boost, benefiting both students as well as businesses. Lenovo strongly advocates such education from an early age, and is working with schools like ITE College West and Spectra Secondary School to help equip students with the necessary tools.\n\nDaniel Soh\n\nManaging Partner\n\nLeadership Advisory Inc\n\nI AM encouraged by the government's efforts to foster a more inclusive and sustainable future for our people and businesses. Budget 2014 has taken a more focused approach, as Singapore continues to build inclusive growth and create a more sustainable business environment. It is good to see that the government has taken into consideration the needs of SMEs.\n\nThe PIC scheme provides useful support for progressive and more sustainable growth. Singapore companies, including our firm, can continue to build a strong brand to fully capitalise on regional growth in Asia.\n\nOn a personal level, it is also heartening to see that more is being done to strengthen our social safety nets. This includes support for the low to middle-income families and purposeful steps to take care of our senior citizens.\n\nToru Shimada\n\nManaging Director, Chairman and CEO\n\nRakuten Asia Pte Ltd\n\nTHE $500 million IPG grant could help local retail businesses enhance their productivity by adopting online and mobile e-commerce solutions to expand their reach, streamline workflow and bring them closer to their customers. With e-commerce sales expected to increase and the Asia-Pacific region set to become the world's No 1 market over the next few years, this grant comes at an opportune moment to ride the wave of growth.\n\nSocial enterprises could benefit from similar grants too. Instead of relying solely on donations and subsidies, organisations such as MINDS are selling products to augment their funds. Moving into the e-commerce space could help them improve their fund-raising efforts and drive awareness for their cause. Assistance could come in the form of funding or training to equip these social enterprises with the knowledge and skills that they need to establish an online presence.\n\nPhilippe H J Huinck\n\nRegional Managing Director, South and South East Asia\n\nInternational SOS\n\nENHANCING workforce productivity has been a recurring theme, and it remains a key focus in this year's Budget speech. We applaud the government's slew of attractive incentives and measures aimed at improving productivity across businesses. In the long run, this will help sharpen Singapore's edge in an increasingly competitive global business environment.\n\nSpecific to health care, the government unveiled a generous package directed at Singapore's pioneer generation as well as low and middle-income families. It is a comprehensive scheme that will help those who are most at risk. However, the government could also look into incentives that would encourage a healthy professionals, managers, executives and businessmen (PMEB) workforce. Initiatives could be drawn up to keep this segment - which represents a significant portion of Singapore's middle class white collar labour - fit and healthy. This in turn helps to boost productivity levels. Organisations and the government should work together to develop incentives that would encourage the introduction or increase participation of health and personal wellness programmes at workplaces. At International SOS, we strongly believe in looking after the health of our employees. We also regularly engage with companies to discuss ways to best take care of their workforce. This includes site health reviews and periodic medical check-ups to keep employees in the pink of health.\n\nAlex Caro\n\nChief Technology Officer and Vice-President of Services, Asia Pacific and Japan\n\nAkamai Technologies\n\nICT is undergoing a radical change due to the emergence of cloud, mobile, social media and big data. The great businesses of tomorrow will use these new technologies to be extremely agile, maintain constant contact with their customers, and make better decisions based on deep data analytics. In this context, it was very gratifying to see the 2014 Budget establish important areas of support for businesses seeking to transform themselves through ICT, in programmes such as the PIC and through R&D credits.\n\nHowever, financial support is only a part of the solution - ICT knowledge is also critical. SMEs in particular would benefit from a more holistic approach through public-private collaborations to guide them through the process of ICT adoption, to help identify key technologies for their sector, and to implement these in a way that maximises returns on investment.\n\nWong Heng Chew\n\nPresident\n\nFujitsu Singapore\n\nIT is heartening to see part of the Budget focusing on increasing productivity and promoting innovation among businesses. As a firm believer of the role of technology in driving innovation, the measures that have been put in place are indicative of the government's belief in the benefits of adopting ICT solutions. The measures are also an endorsement of the work that companies like Fujitsu does.\n\nTo take advantage of the new measures, the responsibility now lies with businesses to drive a culture of learning and innovation within their organisations. At Fujitsu, we believe in the constant pursuit of innovation as there are infinite possibilities that technological developments can achieve. This belief has kept us invested in R&D and helped us achieve technological breakthroughs for our customers. Likewise, businesses need to stay invested and continue to enhance their productivity and add value to their work. They will also need to show discernment in the areas requiring improvement within their organisation to truly benefit from the Budget measures.\n\nDhirendra Shantilal\n\nBoard Director & Head, Asia Pacific\n\nFircroft\n\nWITH the increase in employer contributions to CPF, I'm sure that a key concern for businesses would be increases in personnel costs. But with incentives proposed by the government in the Budget, I believe that these increases would not have a significant impact on our business or industry.\n\nExtending the PIC scheme by three years and raising the expenditure cap is a good initiative that provides more help for SMEs, and helps promote productivity for the overall economy. By ensuring that our industries remain competitive, increased productivity would ensure that long-term real wages rise and the quality of living for everyone is improved.\n\nHence, I believe that the overall push for innovation and productivity is in the right direction. To meet specific business needs, the government can also do more to provide additional incentives for companies that require very niche and highly-skilled employees, as these talents might come with a higher salary that some SMEs might not be able to meet.\n\nAdam Judd\n\nVice-President for Asia Pacific\n\nBrocade\n\nRISING business and living costs are very real problems facing Singapore today. Budget 2014 has hit the right note by addressing concerns from the public and business community. From a socio-economic standpoint, there are no losers. Almost every Singaporean stands to gain from the Budget with new measures that aim to build a more inclusive society.\n\nFor businesses, the extension of tax incentives for supporting innovation and skills by 10 years is a great bonus for organisations looking to adopt a sustained approach to harnessing technology for business success. Technology will continue to play a crucial role in transforming business models and economics, and we applaud the 2014 Budget for helping businesses here, especially SMEs, move up the value chain.\n\nArsh Chaudhry\n\nExecutive Managing Director, South East Asia\n\nCushman & Wakefield\n\nONE of the biggest challenges that most governments across Asia grapple with today is that of inclusive growth, and addressing that head-on in our Budget was a very positive step. The fact that an $8 billion initiative can be funded out of a single year highlights the government's financial strength.\n\nNo hike in the corporate and personal income tax rates was also a positive step which continues to position Singapore competitively against other cities in Asia.\n\nThat the residential property cooling measures were not relaxed was not a surprise; indeed it reinforces the government's commitment to narrow the price to income gap. The markets have seen a correction over the course of 2013, and will probably continue to correct by another 5-7 per cent in 2014 before they stabilise on the back of latent demand due to low unemployment and a positive economic outlook.\n\nChris Wei\n\nGroup CEO\n\nGreat Eastern Holdings\n\nTHE 2014 Budget featured many highlights. One that stood out for us was the significant enhancements to healthcare affordability for Singaporeans. This will be through introducing subsidies for MediShield Life; expanding subsidies at specialist outpatient clinics; and increasing CPF contributions by employers to better provide for Singaporeans' future medical needs. We roundly applaud and fully support the government's move to provide lifetime healthcare benefits for the pioneer generation who deserve no less for their immense contributions to Singapore's development.\n\nOur studies have shown that rising healthcare costs is a major concern for many. We subscribe to the adage that prevention is better than cure. Great Eastern developed the Live Greatprogramme which provides customers with holistic information and tools to live healthier while our health and wellness advisory council provides expert advice, helps us identify trends and develop programmes for our customers in their journey to better health.\n\nFor healthcare costs and premiums to remain affordable on a sustainable basis, there is a need to review the utilisation of all forms of medical facilities and services, as well as consider new innovative models in healthcare provision, to enhance system efficiency and ensure that overall medical inflation is well contained. As a market leader in Singapore, we look forward to work with the government to provide comprehensive healthcare coverage for all Singaporeans.\n\nLow Lee Yong\n\nCEO and Founder\n\nMHC Asia Group of companies\n\nI AM glad that funds are being injected into healthcare subsidies and infrastructure as this will help better take care of the elderly and the vulnerable segments of our society. However the bigger challenge is making these funds accessible without tedious paperwork throughout the healthcare chain. The relevant agencies will need to brainstorm and work together to cut red tape if we truly want to reach out to help these people.\n\nMeantime, while enhancing our healthcare 'hardware', we cannot overlook the 'software' components. We read about government clinics under pressure to shorten waiting times. Usually, this is a matter of distributing manpower resources and managing expectations.\n\nIf primary care is the core thrust of Singapore health care, then policies must engage people to select the right healthcare resources and not always expect shorter waiting times at government specialist clinics and A&E.\n\nChristophe Duchatellier\n\nCEO\n\nAdecco Asia\n\nWHAT stood out was that this year's Budget is clearly focused on the people - notably the Pioneer Package - and also on productivity and innovation. As Singapore faces an increasingly competitive and dynamic future, the Budget continues to reflect the strong focus that the government has for social and economic developments, clearly indicative of the role that Singapore has in terms of being a key regional player.\n\nAs the country gears up to develop further, there is a need for talent to sustain the demands of a competitive market. Fresh graduates, professionals, managers and executives will find themselves in a dynamic marketplace with exciting opportunities for professional career growth. We see SMEs expanding with new government funding, as well as continued demand for IT and finance professionals. Singapore continues to be a leader in the region, with regional headquarters for multinationals being based here.\n\nSuccess in 2014 will depend largely on how we can continually find creative ways of tapping talent and ensuring that businesses in Singapore and the region continue to be staffed by the best talent.\n\nLeong Yee May\n\nSenior Vice-President - Asia Pacific\n\nOrange Business Services\n\nBUDGET 2014 will provide a substantial step up for SMEs in terms of funding support for growth ventures, and raising productivity through ICT adoption. Emerging technologies such as cloud computing, unified communications and enterprise mobility are creating a new workspace that will be key for the growth of enterprises. Adopting such solutions will provide enterprises with significant cost savings by moving to an opex-based model, instead of upfront investments which could be challenging for smaller firms. It will also enable them to scale up and down with business momentum, thereby allowing easier entry into new markets.\n\nThe new measures will act as a greater stimulant to smaller enterprises that can now consider expansion. Hence, the ICT industry in Singapore as a whole will benefit from the Budget's funding support for raising productivity and promoting innovation.\n\nKen Mandel\n\nManaging Director, Asia Pacific\n\nHootSuite\n\nI APPLAUD the government's continuing efforts to encourage the use of ICT, particularly the push for emerging technology solutions with the potential to transform businesses. However, to really make Singaporean companies pay attention, the rollout of the three-year $500 million ICT scheme should come in tandem with updated technical skills development initiatives.\n\n2014 will be the year that enterprises across the globe take social media seriously, and Singapore has the opportunity to become the regional hub for social deployment.\n\nA recent study by management consultants Deloitte shows that social media is already being widely used by a range of departments across organisations, including marketing (78 per cent are using it), IT (64 per cent), sales (63 per cent), and customer service (62 per cent). And surprisingly, even internal functions such as operations (46 per cent), supply chain operations (36 per cent), risk management (35 per cent) and finance (28 per cent) have adopted social media for business.\n\nIf Singapore is to become a social hub for this type of technology deployment, the focus needs to extend to education so that enterprises can use social media intelligently to drive the business. As an organisation, we're committed to professionalising social media education by investing in programmes such as HootSuite University, which recently awarded its 9,000th diploma in social media management. The programme empowers both professors and students by providing a free, up-to-date curriculum drawing from the most current social media challenges businesses face.\n\nIn 2014, I hope to see more schools in Singapore realise that social media proficiency is a mission-critical business asset and begin to offer social media and digital classes as part of their formal curriculum.\n\nLeong Soo Yee\n\nHead of ACCA Singapore\n\nWE congratulate the government on extending and enhancing the PIC scheme. This financial innovation has assisted and will continue to assist SMEs in Singapore. A new report from ACCA (the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants) titled Innovations in access to finance for SMEs highlighted a number of possible innovations that Singapore could explore in the future to continue to support local SMEs.\n\nThese include innovative financial instruments and structures that together help to create new ways for savers and borrowers, investors and entrepreneurs, to meet and do business. In the UK and US, new sources of equity and debt funding for SMEs are opening up via the crowdfunding and peer-to-peer (p2p) movements. With p2p lending platforms, the key innovation has been the creation of a Web-based marketplace in which individuals or institutions with capital to invest are able to make contact with SMEs that want to borrow, and agree to advance funds to them on standardised terms set out by the platform that facilitates the transaction. Direct lending via these non-bank forms of mediation is poised to become a significant alternative source of funding for SMEs in a growing number of countries in the years ahead.\n\nGoing forward, we hope to see more financial innovations from the government as well as the private sector to help SMEs.\n\nChris Comer\n\nCEO and Property Developer\n\nCastlewood Group\n\nDESPITE having lost its surprise element by having been announced earlier, the Pioneer Generation Package still dominated a very nation-friendly Budget. The total funding for this patriotic initiative of $8 billion being ring-fenced this year is another laudable move, and highlights the country's good fiscal husbandry. Few nations could swallow such an amount in one year from a Budget surplus.\n\nWhen you include the hike in tobacco taxes, which can never be high enough, the 2014 Budget seemed to be an exercise in doing the right thing, and that in itself is something that we can be very proud of. We can boast about our Budget policy and directives specifically pandering to the hearts and lungs of our nation. With recognition of our forefathers, better education and affordable health care for all, Singapore has boosted its national and international appeal even further - and that's good for business.\n\nEric Hoh\n\nVice-President, Asia South & Korea Regions\n\nSymantec\n\nWITH productivity and innovation emerging as central pillars in the 2014 Budget, businesses are spurred to re-engineer their approach in their business operations and scale. In particular, SMEs scaling up their capabilities have to ensure that they upgrade their IT infrastructure and solutions, while keeping costs low. This will also address the explosive growth of data and information over the past few years, which has made it imperative to discover new ways to manage and safeguard valuable information. It will be interesting to see how companies take advantage of the $500 million IPG programme to keep pace.\n\nThis is particularly relevant with the upcoming Personal Data and Protection Act, which will provide a framework that holds companies accountable for their customers' information and data, drawing the spotlight once again on data centre and data flow security in the virtual environment. To meet this specific business need, we are likely to see companies adopting robust information management strategies, and moving towards the concept of Software Defined Everything - where every stage of the data centre is virtualised and hosted on the cloud.\n\nSam Yap\n\nGroup Executive Chairman and Co-Founder\n\nHtwo Investment Holdings Pte Ltd\n\nLOCAL companies will applaud the extension of the PIC scheme and introduction of PIC+ scheme. This will no doubt be helpful to many businesses in Singapore. The provision of such initiatives will help companies to level up their business activities to improve productivity and promote innovation.\n\nGenerally, Budget 2014 covers the social and economic horizon of Singapore. More support is provided for raising productivity, enhancing social equity and quality growth. For us in the education business, the funding initiatives for pre-school to tertiary education reflects the strong emphasis on the role of education in our economy. This is indeed great for us service providers and for families requiring educational and enrichment programmes for their children.\n\nPatrick Liew\n\nManaging Partner\n\nGlobal Enterprise Exchange\n\nMANY small businesses are not aware of the many initiatives and support schemes in Budget 2014. Some of them do not know how they can enhance their productivity and innovation. As they are small in size and scale of operation, they may not have the right personnel and expertise to apply for various incentives. They may not have the structure, system and process to implement new procedures and models.\n\nThe government should enhance its educational programmes to help guide small businesses through a series of practical training and coaching workshops. It can look at how to provide leadership and advice to, for example, help small businesses merge their operations or hunt as a pack. In doing so, it can help them to enjoy economies of scale, link diverse markets, and strengthen their competitive edge and value-addition.\n\nGery Messer\n\nManaging Director, Asia Pacific\n\nCenturyLink Technology Solutions\n\nTHESE are exciting times for Singapore, a nation whose journey from Third World to First is still regarded as an economic miracle. Half a decade later, the Singapore story continues to unfold. More than at any time, this innovation hub, whose external trade is today three times that of its gross domestic product, needs to continue to inspire its citizens - corporate and individuals alike - to keep pace with a rapidly changing economic reality by raising the bar in productivity. I applaud the government for taking decisive measures to help its enterprises keep pace with these new realities, through pertinent investments in ICT.\n\nOne priority investment which more enterprises should consider making is in the optimisation of business operations with the cloud in mind. It is heartening to see that almost half of enterprises in Singapore already understand the cloud advantage, with the FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods), manufacturing and automotive sectors leading the charge. The same research shows that while Singapore firms were quicker than others to realise benefits of the cloud, more can be done to further raise productivity, via outsourced managed services and co-location models.\n\nCenturyLink Technology Solutions has always believed that tomorrow's game-changers will be enterprises which take advantage of pre-existing ICT services and platforms, focus on the business (not on the technology that runs it), reinvent themselves, and productively empower and engage their customers, employees and stakeholders to be part of their growth story. Two weeks ago, we witnessed how the market rewarded a 55-employee mobile messaging firm, based in Silicon Valley, with an unprecedented US$19 billion valuation. I believe the day will come, when history repeats itself in this \"First World Oasis\", as Singapore continues to push the envelope in productivity.\n\nJoshua Soh\n\nManaging Director for Singapore and Brunei\n\nCisco\n\nI AM particularly pleased that Budget 2014 focused on raising productivity through technology and education.\n\nStrengthening support for early adopters of new technologies in the Budget validates technology's critical role in raising productivity and immediately differentiates Singapore from other emerging economies. Companies can then explore and benefit from connecting the unconnected, moving Singapore towards an Internet of Everything economy. This environment will allow organisations here to pioneer innovations as well as the adoption of connectivity and collaboration in the region, providing tangible benefits such as greater asset utilisation, employee productivity, accelerated time-to market and enhanced customer experience.\n\nEducation is another key enabler of productivity. In an age where everything is connected, Singapore has immense need for skilled talent and for current professionals to adopt a life-long learning attitude to maintain Singapore's position as a regional business and social hub. We can ensure a future-ready workforce by investing in education for our current generation and providing our employees multiple learning opportunities through online, on-demand courses.\n\nCongratulations Singapore on an inclusive and well-considered Budget that will propel our nation into the future!\n\nLawrence Chan\n\nVice-President of Asia Pacific Merchant Services and General Manager of Southeast Asia & India\n\nPayPal\n\nTHE Internet has created new opportunities for businesses, and increased government support through programmes such as the Market Readiness Assistance scheme and the new IPG programme will empower local businesses to reach new markets around the world without having even to step foot on foreign soil. This is complementary with our focus at PayPal to enable local businesses of all sizes to expand and succeed through e-commerce.\n\nWe believe that with increased access to innovative technologies such as online payments through these schemes, SMEs will be armed with the right tools to drive business productivity, increase revenue and ease the cost and labour pressures that they face today.\n\nScott Morris\n\nVice-President and General Manager Asean\n\nNetApp Asean\n\nOVERALL, I was heartened to see a continued investment in Singapore's SMB marketplace, increased support for businesses to invest in innovation and skills and a commitment to ICT upskilling. Singapore and Asia's SME landscape is growing significantly. To allow for the continued growth of this innovative space, the Singapore government is making the right decision to continue investing in locally based SME talent while ensuring continued upskilling.\n\nWith every Budget announcement, there is always more that could be done. Firstly, I believe that more can be done to ensure continued education and upskilling of the broader Singaporean population around new technologies and innovation. In the past year, we've seen a significant push towards accelerating connectivity, mobility and collaboration digitally. We need to ensure that the broader Singaporean population is equipped with these skills.\n\nSecondly, the definition of an SME leaves many companies out of the overall scheme. Instead of benefitting SMEs only, it is important for all organisations, big and small, to have the right business support and growth infrastructure.\n\nRaed S Haddad\n\nManaging Director, Asia Pacific\n\nESI International\n\nGIVEN today's complex and competitive business environment, there is a growing need for organisations to maximise their productivity levels. In the project management space, to maintain workforce productivity and agility, developing leadership capabilities among employees has become a prerequisite. Nurturing leadership skills is also vital and a priority for organisations in empowering their workforce to design appropriate responses within a business context. Forward-looking organisations identify their workforce as the primary investment and are increasingly focusing on training that produce measurable results and lead to clear business improvement.\n\nMoreover, organisations are turning to targeted and innovative learning programmes through technology to help support their employees. One of the key focus areas for this year's Budget is raising productivity as well as engaging technology - and this push couldn't have come at a better time.\n\nMichael Jenkins\n\nChief Executive\n\nRoffey Park Asia Pacific\n\nDEPUTY Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Tharman Shanmugaratnam said: \"We need a workplace culture where employees' views and contributions are valued, up and down the line. When employees are engaged and empowered, productivity goes up.\" His comments really struck a chord. Our own research shows that organisations are well on track, with 65 per cent of human resource managers reporting that their organisations were taking steps to boost productivity.\n\nKey to this is a focus on managing performance effectively, which puts the onus firmly on managers being able to hold difficult and challenging conversations as well as to engage and motivate. Having this focus on performance is a positive move, but the most impactful way of enhancing productivity is to improve our leadership to enable employees to deliver to their full potential. And to do that, we need to start with ourselves as role models.\n\nPrakash Mallya\n\nCountry Manager\n\nIntel Singapore and Malaysia\n\nTHE government's push to spur SMEs' ICT adoption is a timely shot in the arm as they struggle to differentiate themselves in a competitive environment. SMEs currently form the backbone of the economy as they employ a large portion of the workforce and contribute to nearly half of Singapore's GDP. We hope this incentive will enable SMEs to confidently leverage IT to transform business processes and deliver world class products and services to their customers.\n\nAt Intel, we are committed to helping SMEs meet their business objectives. We work with industry partners that make our analytics capabilities more accessible to interested smaller companies. We also support an environment that helps them thrive in higher value business models while recognising that embedded systems, for example, is an opportunity where SMEs can value add. Our long term goal is to help the ecosystem mature to a stage where service providers will include real-time analytics and offer the service to SMEs.\n\nJoshua Yim\n\nCEO\n\nAchieve Group\n\nWHAT stands out for my industry is the extension of the PIC scheme till 2018 as well as the PIC+ scheme, as this is applicable to the type of human resource (HR) consulting work that we do. The increase of the expenditure cap from $400,000 to $600,000, for instance, is good news as our clients now have more resources at their disposal to utilise the HR consulting services that we provide, such as training, career roadmaps for staff development and even salary benchmarking as part of their talent engagement and retention strategy.\n\nThe other point that stands out is the CPF employer contribution increase of one per cent for all workers. This is not very favourable for employers even with the one-year Temporary Employment Credit of 0.5 per cent as it is just short-term assistance, and employers will still feel the pain in the long-term addition to business cost.\n\nHigh business operating costs in Singapore are pushing many companies to venture overseas, motivated either by survival or expansion. Currently, there is a government initiative to incentivise staff being posted overseas but it is a small component. I would like to propose a larger incentive for companies wanting to go overseas and grow their business in the Asean region or other parts of the world. Perhaps the authorities can look into how to tweak the policies or offer specific initiatives to spur companies going overseas.\n\nOverall, I feel that this Budget is quite well crafted, addressing the various levels of society and its needs. The Pioneer Generation Package, especially, is reflective of a caring government, honouring those who have contributed to nation-building in the earlier years. The voices of the general public with regard to rising medical costs were also adequately addressed.\n\nJohn Hines\n\nArea Vice-President, South Asia and India\n\nVerizon Enterprise Solutions\n\nTWO huge challenges for businesses today are driving productivity through innovation, and raising living standards by transforming societies in ways that we never dreamed of.\n\nLocal businesses presently operate in an increasingly connected, virtualised environment, with the amount of data available growing exponentially. From Verizon's perspective, the cloud is the way forward as more organisations adopt cloud computing and storage to manage and process this influx of information and data.\n\nHowever, this approach requires resources and infrastructure that smaller businesses do not have or can ill-afford to commit, denying them access to crucial technologies to optimise their operation and maximise productivity.\n\nTherefore, it is heartening to see initiatives like the IPG programme to boost adoption of ICT solutions among SMEs, enabling them to invest in innovation and productivity without compromising their core business functions.\n\nTransformation-enabling technologies have never been more affordable and powerful. The spread of technologies such as cloud computing has immense potential to change society, particularly in education, energy and health care.\n\nNikolaus Albrecht\n\nFounder and Managing Director\n\nFNT Software\n\nBUDGET 2014 did well in calibrating a balance between driving the broader needs of society and priming businesses to attain further productivity in order to remain competitive. Specifically, the key measures to further propel innovation and skills development and get more businesses to adopt ICT solutions resonates particularly well with us.\n\nIn a dynamic world, harnessing the likes of IT automation and big data are extremely important in building a competitive advantage for businesses. Increasingly evident is the trend towards industrial-scale enterprise offerings rather than customised ICT solutions. Through FNT Software's effort in pushing the boundaries of modularisation and standardisation, the old project-based ICT production processes are slowly giving way to information technology factories that are geared to the needs of business. The \"IT factory\" concept entails defining, automating and integrating ICT services. By adopting the \"IT factory\" concept, businesses can increase their productivity growth by standardising IT solutions. In combining all product and service-related information into a central database, businesses can deliver higher quality products and services while keeping costs down. For many businesses, higher productivity levels are achieved through more efficient service management and greater automated ICT service structure. The \"IT factory\" is starting to take hold in developed markets and Asian businesses would do well to gain a quick understanding to keep pace.\n\nMichael Smith\n\nCountry Director\n\nRandstad Singapore\n\nTHE extension of PIC for another three years and the introduction of the PIC+ package demonstrates the government's continued focus on improving productivity in Singapore.\n\nAs well as capitalising on the government's support and initiatives, business leaders need to employ their own programmes to boost their organisation's productivity.\n\nHalf of the employers surveyed in the 2013/14 Randstad World of Work Report said that developing leadership skills for the next phase of business growth is the biggest productivity challenge that their organisation will face over the next 12 months.\n\nIt is therefore imperative that business leaders consider the HR department as a strategic partner and ensure that a long-term workforce strategy forms a key part of their core business strategy.\n\nHR directors need to champion their role in the business, collaborating across all departments to build strong employer branding. This will ensure that organisations can attract and retain the right talent to boost workforce productivity, while developing the leadership skills required to drive their business forward.\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nMANY people have welcomed the 2014 Budget for its inclusion of initiatives to strengthen the social safety net for Singaporeans and ease the cost burden of the lower and middle income groups in particular. The highlight of the Budget was the $8 billion Pioneer Generation Package comprising healthcare benefits for senior Singaporeans, which I personally think is a great initiative to help the elderly in our midst.\n\nFor the business community, the Budget offers enhanced measures to help companies increase their productivity via the PIC extension and PIC+ scheme, as Singapore continues on its challenging journey towards economic restructuring.\n\nOne of the most pertinent issues in our recruitment industry is labour shortage so businesses are generally relieved that there were no additional tightening measures on the manpower policies (except for the construction sector). However, I would have liked to see even more assistance given to companies, especially the SMEs, to help address this major challenge.\n\nRobin C Lee\n\nGroup COO\n\nBok Seng Group\n\nAS in the preceding years, this year's Singapore Budget sees the government continuing to offer financial incentives for businesses, especially SMEs, to get more productive. This Budget also continues to foster an inclusive society with the announcement of the widely-anticipated and well received Pioneer Generation Package and all forms of reliefs from parent to handicapped spouse, sibling and child.\n\nThe tightening of foreign labour inflows has made its impact felt. Mindsets must change if they have not already been tuned to adapt to this reality. At the company level, the extension of the PIC scheme till 2018 would give us further opportunities to explore ways to manage and be more productive in a very difficult industry (logistics services) which is labour intensive while manpower is in short supply. We will have to continue to invest in more technologies to make our work processes more efficient.\n\nOn the socio-economic front, there must be constant redistribution of wealth to ensure that the income gap narrows. Any further widening of our wealth gap will slowly but surely create social difficulties which may lead to a deep rupture of the social fabric.\n\nLam Kok Wah\n\nRegional Sales Director\n\nAsia, Veeam Software\n\nTHE exponential growth of data, coupled with pressure on IT executives to minimise costs and increase efficiency, makes data virtualisation and migration to the cloud an inevitable task for any organisation looking to retain competitiveness. The Budget this year placed significant emphasis on adopting ICT solutions to increase productivity. One way of doing so is for organisations to look beyond the basic advantages of moving data to the cloud and towards maximising the full potential of virtualisation to enhance and grow their businesses.\n\nWe have seen a 77 per cent growth year-on-year in the number of customers in Singapore with demand for back-up and management solutions for the modern data centre. As more businesses look to virtualisation to improve productivity, three key areas for consideration include (i) enabling task automation to maximise resources; (ii) accommodating workforce mobility for increased efficiency and (iii) implementing a solid on-demand disaster recovery strategy to ensure business continuity. In 2014, managing the data environment will be imperative for businesses to remain relevant.\n\nAlick Chia\n\nDirector, Business Support,\n\nSKF Asia Pacific Pte Ltd\n\nIN the last few years, the government has created many initiatives to build an inclusive society. The new focus on the pioneer generation is another major step in this direction. Many single, poor and old Singaporeans who had worked hard in their young days to help build the Singapore that we now take for granted will benefit from this scheme. Some do not have proper medical care, and the package of healthcare perks will help them greatly.\n\nSingapore succeeded in the last 50 years largely due to the hard work of every individual, and many have moved out of poverty. Many have made good in their career and business. We must ensure that this social mobility continues in our society, especially when income divide is becoming a major global social issue.\n\nMany initiatives to encourage innovation and productivity are good. However, the government needs to take appropriate measures to assist SMEs to tap the schemes by helping them to overcome cashflow issues. Many improvement possibilities require upfront cash investments before the company can receive financial support. Those that are cash-strapped will not be able to take advantage of the schemes offered.\n\nRichard Hong\n\nCEO\n\nT\u00dcV S\u00dcD Asean\n\nOUR business is about testing, certification, auditing and inspection, so what we do is tightly correlated to technology. In fact, we must be on a par with or even ahead of technological advancements so that we fulfil our commitment of protecting mankind and the natural environment against risks from new technologies. We are very encouraged by the Singapore government's decision to continue extensive R&D expenditure tax deductions as we procure costly testing and inspection equipment to pursue new discoveries that will benefit Singapore at large.\n\nWe are also happy about the government's decision to offer more support for companies expanding overseas. With the vision of an upcoming single Asean economic market, this is very timely as we are now actively seeking new opportunities in emerging economies such as Myanmar and Cambodia, and investing aggressively elsewhere in the region. Singapore is T\u00dcV S\u00dcD's first stop in Asia and we chose Singapore as our Asian HQ mostly due to the positive business environment built by the Singapore government. The pro-growth incentives announced at Budget 2014 reinforce our determination to remain in Singapore and play our part in building this economy.\n\nRangu Salgame\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nGrowth Ventures for Tata Communications\n\nWITH globalisation and continuous development in technology, this year's Budget include incentives and support for local companies to internationalise their operations. As a business, our global reach and market-leading connectivity give our customers the speed to market that is required to keep them ahead of the game in terms of local operations and international expansion.\n\nWe have chosen Singapore as our international headquarters - and over the past few years, have invested considerably in the country; by not only supporting local job creation but also by bringing in new skillsets and technologies into the region. Looking ahead, Tata Communications continues to focus on Singapore with significant investments into infrastructure and technologies around cloud enablement and unified communications, all of which are aimed at equipping businesses of the future. Our global customers find our commitment to Singapore important as part of their globalisation strategies - particularly those with a focus on Asia.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Viktor Yanukovych, the pro-Russian president of the former Soviet state, was ousted last week. But his supporters in the ethnically Russian Crimean peninsula are militating against the new government in Kiev with the apparent support of Russian troops.\n\nOn Friday, President Barack Obama said he was deeply concerned by reports that Russia is intervening in the Crimea, warning \"there will be costs\" if it continues. The last time a major conventional army marched into a neighbouring nation was Saddam Hussein's incursion in Kuwait, which sparked decades of conflict.\n\n\"You do want to pay attention to things in the Ukraine,\" said Quincy Krosby, investment strategist at Prudential Financial. \"If things heat up with the Russian factor, that's something that can affect the market. Anything that looks like military intervention could have a dampening effect on the European market, and that could seep into the US market.\"\n\nEurope's eastern fringes - from the Middle East to the Balkans to the Ukraine itself - are notoriously unstable.\n\nWhen shots are fired in this part of the world, \"it's like lighting a match\" near a tinder box, said Ms Krosby, a former State Department official.\n\nLast week, the broad Standard & Poor's 500 finished at its highest level ever after Federal Reserve chairman Janet Yellen said the central bank stood ready to increase its levels of bond buying if the economy took a turn for the worse. Even Friday's drastic downward revision to the rate of fourth-quarter gross-domestic product growth caused stocks to rise as traders bet it would encourage Ms Yellen to pause in the \"tapering\" of purchases. This week, there will be a cornucopia of data to digest, including key manufacturing and services surveys midweek and Friday's February jobs report from the Labor Department.\n\nThe February jobs report may be the \"anti-Goldilocks\" - just cold enough to raise growth concerns, but not cold enough to prompt the Fed to change its policy. Most economists expect the number of jobs added to be well shy of the 200,000 level associated with optimum growth and the unemployment rate to tick down by no more than one tenth of one percentage point.\n\n\"The Fed is clear that they don't want to pause on the taper,\" said Ms Krosby. \"It's clear that the threshold is quite high - what you're left with is how 'bad does bad need to be?' If things deteriorated and there's a major U-turn in the economy, she will pause, but nobody knows how bad bad has to be.\"\n\nEven if the jobs report is worse than expected, both investors and central bankers will take the negative surprise with a pinch of salt said Oliver Pursche, president of money manager Gary Goldberg Financial Services.\n\n\"There will be weather distortions in the jobs report,\" Mr Pursche said. \"If you look at the way markets reacted on economic data that kind of brushed off bad news, saying 'Well, you don't know how much the weather's playing into that.' \"\n\nSimilarly, investors may turn a blind eye to the Institute for Supply Management's factor-activity index, likely to teeter near the flat line for the second straight month.\n\nMost investors are working under the assumption, \"that 'when the weather gets better, the data will get better as well,' \" as portfolio strategists at brokerage Barclays Capital put it.\n\nOne reason the rally may continue in the weeks and months to come - barring an \"exogenous shock\" like an international war - is the fact that most stocks are relatively cheap compared with historical averages.\n\nJD Joyce, a financial adviser and president of JD Joyce Investment Management Group in Houston, said the market is overdue for a significant correction. Still, he is encouraging clients to buy stocks because the average price-to-earnings multiple remains low, suggesting any correction would be short-lived.\n\n\"In an environment where interest rates are at record lows and the market's at a record high, it's almost like having to hold your nose to invest in the equity market,\" Mr Joyce said. \"I'm comfortable doing so.\"\n\nWith the S&P 500 trading at roughly 16 times estimated aggregate 2014 earnings, it's much closer to the historical average \"trough\" of market corrections around 14 times \"forward\" earnings than the average \"peak\" of bull markets around 26 times earnings, Mr Joyce said.\n\nThe standoff in the Crimea is likely to make the market jumpy this week. Still, if there are no further shocks from the Ukraine or from the economic data, expect the US stock market to stay close to its record highs.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These are some of the drastic steps Australian carrier Qantas is taking after posting a pre-tax loss of A$252 million (S$285 million) for the first half of its financial year.\n\nAll these are part of a broader A$2 billion cost-cutting plan drawn up by the carrier which is struggling with its international operations and seeing its domestic market coming under pressure from arch-rival Virgin Australia.\n\nQantas' decision to tie up with Emirates, and reposition its international hub at Dubai has not really helped, it seems. Some observers in Australia, including former Qantas senior officials, have wondered aloud whether this arrangement benefits Qantas or its erstwhile rival.\n\nMeanwhile, the loss of its investment grade following its ratings downgrade to junk status has made fund raising difficult. The question now is, what next?\n\nThe airline business is fraught with more challenges than elsewhere. Anything from terrorism, natural calamities, to union issues, economic conditions and fuel prices can impact business.\n\nIn Qantas' case, there is also the disadvantage of being an end-of-line carrier. Australia makes a good destination, but a bad hub to anywhere other than the icy Antarctic. To some extent, Qantas is a victim of geography.\n\nBut the airline has been pointing fingers at rivals such as Virgin Australia for its woes. CEO Alan Joyce's well-rehearsed line goes like this: Virgin Australia competes on an uneven field, backed by government-owned and cash rich carriers of Singapore, Abu Dhabi and New Zealand. As a result, Virgin Australia has been able to up its game, offering better products and services, and thus drawing business away.\n\nThere is some truth in this. But this is the reality of business today, especially in the world of aviation.\n\nThere are no easy solutions. Hoping for government support may just be that - hope. Despite the utterances of treasurer Joe Hockey, Prime Minister Tony Abbot has shut the door on any bail-out. Blocking competitors (as it did to Singapore Airlines on the trans-Pacific route), doesn't pay off either.\n\nQantas has to re-examine its business model and even is ownership rules. It still controls 65 per cent of its profitable domestic and trans-Tasman market. It has good assets and mostly competent people running them.\n\nIt needs to revamp its international business. Instead of being eurocentric, it should perhaps gravitate more towards Asia, Africa and the Latin Americas - the world's fastest growing aviation markets. Abandoning Changi (an Asian hub where it had strong presence and long history) for Dubai (where its submits to Emirates) has not worked - at least not so far.\n\nQantas is a valuable brand. It has a special place in the hearts of Australians and is a key player in the aviation industry. With the right moves it can regain its former glory.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This study is the first of its kind to cover average residents.\n\nIn the study, Singapore was ranked most expensive in living costs for expatriates. However, this was partially due to a 25 per cent appreciation of the Singapore dollar against the US dollar.\n\nWhen comparing the cost of living index for expatriates in Singapore against the index for Hong Kong, where the currency is tied to the US dollar, ACI found that while Singapore's index value kept rising, Hong Kong's remained relatively dormant.\n\n\"I was curious . . . how could Hong Kong be so flat in the expats' cost of living index, and Singapore's . . . be steadily (increasing)?\" said Tan Khee Giap, co-director of ACI. \"When it comes to average residents, they're about the same. So that puzzled me . . . and we decided, let's investigate.\"\n\nThe \"investigation\" came in the form of a simulation, where ACI used the Singapore dollar exchange rate from 2005 (US$1 = S$1.66) instead of 2012 (US$1 = S$1.25) to calculate the indices.\n\nWithout the 25 per cent exchange rate appreciation effect, Singapore's ranking fell from first to 16th, not far from its 2005 ranking, where it ranked in the 17th place.\n\nHong Kong's simulated result, however, remained in 20th place, as its currency did not appreciate within the same time period.\n\nThe rise in cost of living for expatriates, however, is not solely due to the exchange rate appreciation effect, said ACI. There were some other significant contributing factors, including housing costs (118 per cent increase) and transport (49 per cent increase). In the worldwide rankings for 2012, housing and transport costs for expatriates in Singapore were ranked highest in the world.\n\nEven with the rise in exchange rate, housing costs still ranked second highest in the world, and transport costs remained in first place.\n\nThis does not mean that Singapore is the world's most expensive city, as it is still relatively affordable for locals to live in Singapore.\n\nThe study placed Singapore's cost of living index for average residents at 60th in the 2012 world rankings - a position unaffected by the appreciation in exchange rate, and a far cry from its ranking in the expatriates' cost of living index.\n\nHowever, cautioned Dr Tan Khee Giap, the difference in the indices for expatriates and local residents was not indicative of income disparity or wealth disparity, as the indices were based purely on prices.\n\nThe cost of living being much higher for expatriates than average residents was a trend observed in cities of other Asian countries like Seoul and Beijing.\n\n\"This is a duality effect . . . the filet mignon versus pork chop effect,\" said Tan Kong Yam, co-director of ACI, explaining that the highly different consumption patterns of expatriates and average residents gave rise to the disparity in rankings.\n\nHe also noted that in cities such as Paris and New York this difference was not as apparent, as it was \"roughly equally expensive for expats and domestic residents\" to live there.\n\nIndeed, in comparison to New York - which was used as the base for the study - the average Singaporean's cost of living was 35 per cent lower. Dr Tan Kong Yam pointed out three key areas that were much cheaper for Singaporeans than New Yorkers: healthcare (75 per cent cheaper), education (73 per cent cheaper), and housing (27 per cent cheaper).\n\nThis, he said, was due to government subsidies for Singapore residents in these areas. As expatriates are not covered by these subsidies, they find it more expensive than the local residents.\n\nLooking towards the future, Dr Tan Khee Giap raised the importance of monitoring the affordability of education, housing, healthcare and transport costs for locals over the next decade, mentioning the possibility of ACI doing affordability indices to monitor those four areas.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

BT had earlier cited an official from the Singapore Exchange - which will administer electricity futures trading and be the clearing house - disclosing the April launch of trials, followed by trading proper in October, with dates subject to MAS approval.\n\nEMA said that there are two broad information categories. One is market information available to spot market and non-market participants who subscribe to data services provided by the Energy Market Company which operates the spot market. The second is information available only to spot market participants or a subset of this. And the regulator is proposing that data subscribers should also be given the same market information currently provided to spot market participants or generating companies (gencos).\n\nIt said that it \"has assessed that there would be no commercial sensitivity or adverse impact on market competition or national security\" if such information is extended to others. The latter includes the Adequacy and Security Assessment reports which provide data about forecasts of power system demand, available generation and reserve capacity, and the Annual Outage Plan of participants' planned downtime for overhauls and maintenance of generating units and non-generating equipment. Also included is the Projected Gas Curtailment Schedule on when gencos expect gas supplies to be affected, including by upstream events such as maintenance in the Indonesian and Malaysian gas fields.\n\n\"Disclosure would help to eliminate the significant information asymmetry that currently exists and may provide pro-competitive benefits to futures market participants.\"\n\nThe regulator said that currently, physical offer information including the price-quantity offers of gencos in the spot market for physical delivery to end-consumers is not disclosed. While recognising that this information will help facilitate electricity trading, the EMA added it could also increase the likelihood of independent exercise of market power or concerted activities among spot market participants to push up spot prices, hence EMA's second proposal for the Energy Market Company to publish aggregate energy offer information with a four-week time lag on a trial basis for six months.\n\n\"We assess the four-week delay to be adequate for short-term tight market conditions to normalise and mitigate informational feedback for strategic bidding in the spot market.\" EMA added it will also \"continue to monitor all gencos' bidding behaviour closely and take firm regulatory actions against any genco exhibiting anti-competitive behaviour\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That said, we believe the government is capable of and will continue to maintain firm control of the credit and financial sector.\"\n\nThe uncertain outlook in China has added about US$60 to the gold price, according to Phillip Futures' estimate, showing an uninformed understanding of China's trust market, it said.\n\nIn its view, such products form \"a very small proportion\" of the 11 trillion yuan trust sector, and are only sold to high network individuals who have the ability to absorb such shocks.\n\nThe gold price has risen 7 per cent or some US$91 so far this year, to US$1,294 a troy ounce.\n\nThe slow recovery in the US, coupled with a more hawkish monetary stance that the Federal Reserve took in its last meeting in March, would provide further pressure on gold, said Phillip Futures.\n\nBut unforeseen geopolitical tensions could provide a support to gold price.\n\nAlso, institutional investors - who caused the gold price to plunge 28 per cent last year when they sold off gold-related holdings - have become more positive, which would help boost gold prices.\n\n\"There has been an absence of outflow since mid-February and in fact, there are hints of increase in fund holdings since then,\" said the brokerage house.\n\nBut a combination of rising open interest and long positions - indicating a bet on rising gold prices - is worrying, as a drop in gold prices would lead to a covering of such positions, compounding the slide in gold prices, it added.\n\n\"Looking ahead, fundamental factors offer mixed outlook, sentiments seem to have turned more bullish but technical indicators turned more bearish. As such, the quarter ahead is expected to be a very dynamic and exciting one,\" it said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This transaction is scheduled to be completed in the second quarter, subject to approval by the Chinese authorities. It is not expected to have any material financial impact on the group this fiscal year. Construction will likely begin in the second quarter with the first phase targeted for launch by the end of this year, CapitaLand said.\n\nThis project is nestled in a mature residential area surrounded by mid- to high-end projects and located inside the Da Yuan cluster within the central core of Chengdu's Tian Fu New Area, a modern metropolis that focuses on advanced manufacturing and high-end service industries.\n\nThe sites are served by main roads and Metro Line 5 and enjoy strong connectivity to nearby commercial developments, such as the New Century Global Centre, the world's largest commercial building, as well as other retail, F&B and leisure facilities.\n\nMr Leow said that Raffles City Chengdu, a mixed development consisting of retail, Grade A offices, Ascott-branded serviced residences and premium condominiums that opened in September 2012, and the group's other residential projects in the city such as luxury project, The Loft, have been very well received by the local community.\n\nCapitaLand China had said in its fiscal 2013 report that it expected to hand over more than 3,000 units this year, mainly from The Loft, La Cite in Foshan and International Trade Centre in Tianjin, The Metropolis in Kunshan and Dolce Vita in Guangzhou.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The total consideration paid for the shares was A$12.5 million.\n\nIn addition, SIA's settlement of an equity share swap relating to VAH's entitlement offer in November and December last year allowed the airline to take up another 42,048,785 ordinary shares for A$17.9 million.\n\nVAH's other major shareholders are Air New Zealand with 24.46 per cent, Etihad Airways at 19.9 per cent and Virgin Group with 7.37 per cent. While both Air NZ and SIA have been adding to their stakes over the past six months, the Virgin Group cut its stake by 63 million shares or 2 per cent last October.\n\nWith the acquisition, the free float of Virgin Australia will fall to just 28 per cent, making it one of the most tightly held publicly listed airlines, despite its still unprofitable operations. Virgin Australia reported a net loss of A$98 million for the year ended June 30, 2013.\n\nBesides SIA's portfolio of four key airline brands - Singapore Airlines, SilkAir, Scoot and Tiger Air - its holding in Virgin Australia is becoming increasingly important as seen by the increased stake.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But when spirits are high - in more ways than one - such things don't matter to a Japanese salary man whose sole intention is to pack his daytime persona as straight-laced, subservient model employee back into his manbag so that his real self can come out to play.\n\nBehold the izakaya - a pub with food to you but a way of life to the Japanese, a culture deeply ingrained since the Edo period that's in no danger of dying out any time soon. Certainly not at Tachinomi Marugin - or simply Marugin - a grungy hard-core izakaya that sits on the fringe of Tokyo's shiny Ginza district. Locals and clued-in tourists pack shoulder-to-shoulder in this tight space shrouded in silvery grey smoke as flexible servers coolly slither around, delivering freshly grilled yakitori and boiled edamame. Groups of dark-suited men (and some women) sit with their ties askew, laughing uproariously as they nibble and knock back gulps of Kaku highball served in giant beer mugs - the alcoholic refresher of choice which has become synonymous with Japan's izakaya culture.\n\nThe thirst-quenching, lightly boozy combination of one shot of Suntory whisky and four shots of soda water - the ratio is imperative - is a prime example of how clever marketing and carefully calculated strategy can reverse the image of a once boring liqueur and influence social trends at the same time.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It was the first time since Jan 2 that the STI closed in positive territory for 2014.\n\nFor the week, the index gained 100 points or 3.2 per cent. The STI started the year at 3,167, but since closing at 3,174 on the first day of the year, it has traded below. The first quarter low was 2,960 on Feb 5, which means that since then, the index has bounced 212 points or 7.2 per cent.\n\nThe bulk of the gains over the past fortnight have come courtesy of the banks and Jardine stocks, which has prompted observers to speak of quarter-ending window dressing. That is plausible given that there were no\n\nreally notable market-moving developments on the external front this week other than Russia being axed from the G8 group of nations amid tensions in Crimea, and China releasing weak PMI numbers.\n\nBoth these events were brushed off by markets preoccupied with bond yields, rising interest rates and possibly the health of the US economy.\n\nSomewhat perversely, China's slowdown actually supported stocks because of hopes that the government would have to step in with stimulus measures, while over in the US, strong economic releases were not really welcomed by the market, possibly because they hint at interest rate hikes sooner rather later.\n\nOn Thursday, China's premier Li Keqiang said he recognised downward pressures and downside risks to growth and is well prepared to stabilise growth with a pipeline of policies.\n\nHere, Jardine Matheson proved the top performer with a huge US$7.58 or 14 per cent jump over the five days to US$63.10. Jardine Strategic, Cycle & Carriage and Hongkong Land also weighed in with strong contributions. Among the rest of the index components, a rebound in the banks should also be noted.\n\nAlso helping was Noble Group, whose shares rose 13.6 per cent this week to $1.21. The commodities firm has announced that it has signed a 10-year supply agreement with Sundance Resources, which is planning to mine iron ore in central-west Africa. According to one report, the Noble-Sundance deal may be worth as much as US$3.5 billion a year, based on a sales price of US$100 a tonne after costs.\n\nAmong the banks, OCBC yesterday fell 11 cents to $9.51 on volume of 3.8 million following reports that it has won preliminary approval from Hong Kong regulators to take over Wing Hang Bank. The market perceives OCBC as having overpaid for the acquisition.\n\nIn the second line, satellite and wireless digital technology firm AddValue Technology's shares were by far the best performer with a 7.8-cent or 124 per cent surge during the week to 14.1 cents, the bulk of which came on Wednesday after the company announced that it plans to sell its wholly owned subsidiary AddValue Communications to a China buyer for $330 million in cash.\n\nIn response to a media article that asked for more information, the company responded on Thursday that its technology is attractive to players interested in expanding into the field of high-end broadband satellite communications, and provided examples of other similar sales in the region. AddValue's shares dropped sharply since the mid-week burst which took place on volume of 198 million. In yesterday's session the stock slipped 0.8 cent and just 13.2 million shares were traded.\n\nAmong the other penny stocks in play were China water treatment plays like HanKore and Memstar, while Johor property play Albedo was also in focus despite some confusion over whether its deal in the Iskandar region of Johor is still on.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will be the biggest show since its inception in 2006 featuring 29 events.\n\n\"We have put in more efforts to reach out to the public, especially the young, through fun and exciting outreach activities,\" said Andrew Tan, chief executive of the MPA.\n\n\"Last year's SMW saw some 100,000 participants. We are confident that this year's event will be as successful as previous runs. The continuing growth of SMW shows strong interest in our maritime sector.\"\n\nSingapore's maritime industry contributes 7 per cent to the country's gross domestic product (GDP) and hires about 170,000 people. The industry is made up of some 5,000 companies from 130 shipping groups, offering a range of products and services.\n\n\"We hope to put Singapore on the thought leadership map, by bringing the best experts and practitioners to share their expertise and insights, and promoting the exchange of best practices in the industry. With Singapore's strategic location, SMW also provides a one of its kind business platform for companies to access new market in the region and beyond,\" Mr Tan said.\n\nThought leadership events include the Moore Stephens Shipping Forum, which will discuss the economic trends that affect the shipping industry, the Dry Cargo Chartering Seminar and the Asian Maritime Law Conference, which will showcase the professionals and knowledge leaders.\n\nIn addition, the Automation and Autonomy Seminar will address the challenges of the shortage of skilled labour and productivity, while the Sustainable Marine Transportation Conference, jointly organised by the Royal Norwegian Embassy and MPA, offers insights into global operational and environmental issues, strategies and technological advancements.\n\nThe ReCAAP ISC Piracy and Sea Robbery Conference will give an update on piracy and sea robbery in Asia, and discuss the challenges in providing a safer operating environment for all forms of shipping.\n\nJacques de Chateauvieux, chairman of the board of Bourbon, and chairman and CEO of Jaccar Holdings, will deliver the Singapore Maritime Lecture on April 9.\n\nThe SMW events will also create opportunities to forge business relationships. IBC Asia will organise three offshore conferences for the offshore maritime community. The conferences include the Floating Production Storage and Offloading Conference, Offshore Drilling Conference and Offshore Support Vessels Conference.\n\nThe TOC Contain Supply Chain Asia Conference, which has a 16-year history, will provide a comprehensive event for the container transport community. The Singapore Maritime Lecture cocktail, Seatrade Asia Awards and the Sea Asia launch reception will provide networking opportunities for the local and international participants.\n\nThe Singapore Yacht Show offers an opportunity to discover some of the world's finest superyacht and international yacht brands while the Asia Pacific Superyacht and Boating Conference will be a platform to discuss ideas and promote the industry.\n\nSingaporeans can visit the SMW exhibition at shopping centres - VivoCity, Jurong Point and Parkway Parade - from March 31 to April 6. More than 400 students, maritime employees and the public will go on Maritime Learning Journeys that include a port and sea tour to the Raffles Lighthouse.\n\nMore youths and students will be involved in SMW by co-organising career talks and as guides for selected public outreach activities.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Also, any ships that were touched must be cleaned before moving through water deemed sufficiently clean.\n\nThe closure of the channel on Saturday has led to a queue of more than 90 vessels trying to move into or out of the Gulf of Mexico. Shipping delays forced Exxon Mobil Corp to cut production at the nation's second-largest refinery.\n\nExxon said production at its 560,500 barrel per day Baytown, Texas, refinery had been cut on Monday due to the closure of the Houston Ship Channel.

But there are concerns that the higher cost of SME funding would be passed on to the small businesses.\n\nOne way that higher funding cost is captured in the Basel III regulatory framework is through the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), through which banks show that they are not overly reliant on short-term or unstable funding over a one-year period.\n\nWith an increasing minimum capital requirement under Basel III, banks have to set aside more capital per dollar of risk-weighted assets, and this impacts SME exposures more relatively, said chief financial officer at DBS, Chng Sok Hui.\n\n\"Basel III rules have never specifically targeted SME exposures: it is not a problematic asset class that triggered the global financial crisis. However, SME exposures are typically higher risk and thus invite higher risk weights,\" she said.\n\nStill, SME lending remains one of the bank's priorities, with income from SMEs growing 11 per cent last year to $1.4 billion.\n\n\"We are able to grow the franchise, and stand by our SME customers because of our strong capital ratios,\" said Ms Chng.\n\nUnited Overseas Bank (UOB) and OCBC Bank echoed similar views, noting that the segment is strategically important to the banks.\n\n\"In the small business segment, the risk weighting for assets is low because the loan portfolio is made up of smaller-sized loans spread across a big group of customers. In other words, it is a business with diversified risks,\" said Victor Lee, group head of business banking at UOB.\n\nBut SMEs, having low bargaining power with banks, may bear a disproportionate amount of this increased cost if costs are passed on by banks, said Gary Chia, head of financial services regulatory compliance at KPMG in Singapore.\n\n\"Banks which typically finance SMEs need to improve their capital quality, mostly by resorting to retained earnings. This implies an indirect pressure on margins for these banks, which needs to be passed on to their customers - the SMEs.\"\n\nStill, while Basel III imposes higher capital requirements on banks for lending to smaller SMEs, key SME banks here have already been operating on risk-based models before the introduction of Basel III, noted Linus Goh, chairman of the Singapore Business Federation's (SBF) SME sub-committee on financing.\n\n\"We believe the enhancement to the government risk-sharing from 50 per cent to 70 per cent for the microloan programme in Budget 2014 will also help improve the financing to small businesses,\" said Mr Goh, who is also OCBC's head of global commercial banking.\n\nThere are signs that lending to SMEs have not eased. Based on the SBF-DP SME Index for the first quarter of this year, bank lending has increased and there appears to be a smaller number of SMEs facing financing challenges. Still, last year's SME development survey showed that there are SMEs that continue to have difficulty accessing funding from banks, either because of the lack of a track record or sufficient assets for collateral.\n\nBroadly, Basel III should prompt banks to evolve from universal banks to specialist lenders to improve their margins, said Lim Eng Hock, partner and practise leader at Ernst and Young.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/technology/2014-transformative-year-cloud-computing", "site_title": "2014: A transformative year for cloud computing", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\n2014: A transformative year for cloud computing\n\nMany trends will come to the fore\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Mar 23, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE cloud matured faster last year than in any previous year, with pace-setting organisations using it to accelerate the adoption of mobile, social, analytics and Big Data technologies. But last year was just the tip of the iceberg, compared to what this year has in store for the cloud community.\n\nTo say this year will be a transformative year for the cloud would be an understatement. The push for interoperable clouds, built on open standards, the evolution of delivery models, and the convergence of cloud ecosystems, are just a few examples of trends that will shape cloud computing in the year ahead.\n\nBased on the insights gained from US$6 billion invested in research and development (R&D), 1,400 cloud patents and more than 37,000 cloud specialists, an IBM team looked ahead to see what the cloud would bring to organisations this year. They found some broad trends.\n\nFirstly, the continued adoption of the cloud across different business lines and the spread of shadow IT will lead to a fundamental shift in the role of the CIO (chief information officer).\n\nThe role of the CIO is changing from a manager of traditional IT systems to a broker of cloud infrastructure, applications and information services. As the cloud becomes more pervasive in various lines of business, IT will start to assume ownership of integration, service levels and governance around cloud services.\n\nCIOs today must also strengthen their established relationships with existing IT partners, who will become increasingly important in helping the transition into this new role. By partnering specialists to help guide them on their cloud journey, IT leaders will be able to create business value by reducing risk and accelerating the implementation of cloud services.\n\nSecondly, Cloud Foundry will emerge as the de-facto standard for platform-as-a-service (PaaS). The OpenStack foundation was launched in September 2012; by the end of 2013, OpenStack had emerged as the de-facto industry standard for infrastructure-as-a-service with over 12,000 people involved in the project. As platform-as-a-service offerings mature, the push for a similarly ubiquitous platform built on open standards will intensify as organisations look to avoid vendor lock-in while meeting the demand to build cloud-based mobile, social and analytic applications.\n\nThirdly, industry-specific clouds will become the norm, driving cloud adoption in finance, healthcare, telecommunications, retail, energy and utilities and more.\n\nUntil recently, most clouds fell into the \"one-size-fits-all category\", with basic cloud features and benefits applied to every organisation, regardless of industry. But organisations aren't basic; rather, they belong to an industry with unique needs, challenges and advantages.\n\nTo help facilitate and expedite the move to the cloud, industry-specific clouds are being developed to help organisations - with a common shared service outcome, social need or business requirement - make use of cloud services faster and more efficiently. As a result, the rate of adoption for private clouds will continue to increase. Over the last several years, private cloud deployments have driven a large percentage of the overall cloud spending.\n\nAnother key trend is that mobile-first, cloud-delivered enterprise applications embedded with analytics will create new possibilities for real-time data analysis anywhere on any device. Intelligence is rapidly moving away from individual devices and into the cloud, while an increasingly diverse array of devices are being used to complete essential job functions. As cloud, mobile and Big Data continue to converge, large data sets stored in the cloud are leading to new opportunities for data analysis that were never before possible.\n\nCloud ecosystems are networks where partners and third parties converge to build and deliver an enhanced range of services on top of cloud platforms. As uniformed open standards are increasingly embraced up the stack, ecosystems will expand and will begin to work together to develop top-to-bottom solutions that can be leveraged across any open cloud platform.\n\nUsers who are running on top of an open cloud will benefit tremendously from this convergence, while those running on proprietary models will see their IT deployments become increasingly isolated.\n\nRecently, analyst firm Gartner alluded to this escalating growth in the cloud and predicted that the bulk of new IT spending by 2016 will be for cloud computing platforms and applications, with nearly half of large enterprises having cloud deployments by the end of 2017.\n\nCloud technologies built on open standards have the opportunity to become the norm. Not just in business, but in every way we touch technology. As organisations begin to realise that the cloud can do so much more than simply speed up or reduce the cost of their IT, the cloud will have a significant impact on the way we work and play.\n\nThe author is cloud computing leader at IBM Singapore\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was up from 43.4 per cent a year earlier.\n\nA caveats analysis by CBRE found that the over 40 per cent share started in 2011.\n\n\"This is a function of supply,\" said CBRE Research associate director Desmond Sim, \"as developers have been reducing unit sizes to keep the absolute price quantum affordable to buyers especially investors, who have been slapped with successively tighter loan limits in recent years.\"\n\nThe spike in small units' share, however, is not due to the so-called shoebox apartments (below 500 sq ft) but to 500-800 sq ft units.\n\nThe property consulting group's analysis - which excluded executive condos, a public-private housing hybrid - found that 500-800 sq ft units' proportion has increased steadily to 34.4 per cent last year, from 29.7 per cent in 2012, 25.9 per cent in 2011 and 18.9 per cent in 2010.\n\nThis reflects the trend of developers minting more compact two- and three-bedders in a bid to keep absolute price quantums within buyers' reach - despite higher per square foot prices.\n\nMeanwhile, the share of shoebox units dropped to 13.2 per cent last year, from 13.8 per cent in 2012 and the high of 15.1 per cent in 2011.\n\nAnalysts attribute this partly to an Urban Redevelopment Authority cap, effective Nov 4, 2012, on the number of homes in new non-landed residential projects Outside the Central Area, based on an average unit size of 70 square metres (753.47 sq ft) gross floor area.\n\nThe growing share of small homes in the past few years is also reflected in a contraction in median unit sizes - the figure has shrunk 30.6 per cent to 829 sq ft last year from 1,195 sq ft in 2009. Over the same period, the median per square foot price increased 47.2 per cent to $1,354 from $920, while the median lumpsum unit price rose 12 per cent to $1.08 million from $965,000.\n\nMarket watchers note that the end of the global financial crisis was marked by an era of unprecedented money-printing by governments in many parts of the world, creating a surge of global liquidity and low interest rates.\n\nThis has resulted in investors snapping up properties in many markets - including Singapore, driving up suburban condo prices.\n\nTo counter this, some developers began building a higher ratio of small units to keep lumpsum prices affordable and widen the pool of potential buyers.\n\nDevelopers have also found that small units help investors overcome the lower loan-to-value limits introduced for those with at least one existing home mortgage and seeking to buy more residential properties.\n\nAnd with the Total Debt Servicing Ratio framework rolled out last June, financial institutions are required, when granting property loans to individuals, to cap a borrower's total monthly debt obligations to no more than 60 per cent of gross monthly income.\n\n\"Thus, it has become increasingly difficult for potential homebuyers to obtain a loan, if they do not have enough cash,\" noted Mr Sim.\n\nDevelopers told BT that in 2009, after the global crisis, they were building two-bedroom apartments of typically around 900-950 sq ft. This has shrunk to 700-750 sq ft compact two-bedders today. Over the same period, three-bedroom units have been compressed from 1,100-1,150 sq ft to around 950 sq ft.\n\nFrasers Centrepoint Homes CEO Cheang Kok Kheong said that demand for compact units comes from young couples to baby boomers/retirees. \"Most buyers still want the master bedroom and kitchen to be sufficiently sized. We're also seeing creative storage solutions - for instance, above wardrobes, near the ceiling (by moving air-con pipes to the side) and insertion of linen storage areas along the corridor between the living room and bedrooms.\"\n\nLooking ahead, Mr Sim said that in light of reduced spending power of buyers post-TDSR, developers are likely to stick to the strategy of carving out a high ratio of affordable homes. \"Hence, we will continue to see small-format homes making up a high proportion of new home sales.\"\n\nMr Cheang reckoned that if more study/library space is provided as part of a development's common facilities, compact apartment sizes could potentially be trimmed a further 5-10 per cent. \"But we've not done that because our customers are not ready.\"\n\nAgreeing, another developer said that unit sizes are unlikely to shrink further for the time being. \"However, the proportion of developer sales in the sub-800 sq ft category may still go up because TDSR has reduced loan availability and the still-high property prices force buyers to look at compact units to keep within their budget.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These were priced at 6.5 cents apiece.\n\nHowever, the company last Thursday released the results of the issue, in which it said that only 56.6 million rights shares would be issued. This represented only 18.4 per cent of the original 306.8 million. Nothing was said of PSH.\n\nThe Business Times on Saturday reported puzzlement among many observers over why there was no mention of PSH's entitlement. It was this low subscription rate that had prompted the scaling back of PSH's portion.\n\nAccording to the company's Feb 19 Offer Information Statement posted separately, \"the company may scale down any shareholder's application to subscribe for any rights shares to avoid placing that shareholder in the position of incurring an obligation to make a mandatory general offer\" if other shareholders do not take up their entitlements.\n\nBased on the actual take-up, if PSH was allotted its full entitlement, it would have ended up holding more than 30 per cent of the enlarged capital, triggering a mandatory takeover offer.\n\nYesterday, Unionmet also clarified that another substantial shareholder, Bestway Premium Investments, which on Feb 19 was said to have expressed interest in taking up its rights entitlements, did not do so.\n\nUnionmet is headquartered in Singapore and its production facilities and R&D divisions are located in Liuzhou, Guangxi, China. It makes and trades non-ferrous metals comprising indium ingots and their related by-products. It was listed on Singapore Exchange's mainboard in January 2007.

We get upgraded smartphones with bigger screens and faster processing power, for example, so we waste less time accessing applications, squint less at words and images, and are better distracted by smoothly streaming Korean dramas on the train ride to the office.\n\nThis ideal of the pursuit of the better life seems to have fallen flat after the Singapore Exchange's (SGX) latest revamp of the all-important \"company announcements\" section of its website, which went live over the weekend. The page, which retail investors use to get their corporate news and updates, is somehow less accessible and harder to understand after the change.\n\nThe most baffling, unannounced change concerns real estate investment trusts (Reits) and business trusts. Previously, someone who wanted to search for the announcements made by, say, Cache Logistics Trust, could go directly to the \"company disclosure\" section and search immediately for the name of the company.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/continent-delights", "site_title": "A continent of delights", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nA continent of delights\n\nWith the World Cup in Brazil later this year, South America should be figuring large on people's travel radars. Then there's that list of Latin America's top 50 restaurants, which put countries like Peru on the world gourmet stage. There are now more reasons to hightail it over to the region that's halfway across the world. Cheah Ui-Hoon doles out tips on the top spots to visit as well as gourmet restaurants\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Mar 21, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nPERU\n\nThe place to visit: Machu Picchu\n\nPart of 15th century Machu Picchu's allure is how the Incas had removed the trails leading to the city when the Spanish conquistadors invaded Cuzco, giving rise to the speculation that it was a sacred site for the Incas. Machu Picchu was officially rediscovered four centuries later, in 1911, but the indigenous Quechua tribes were already living and farming there, among the ruins. In 1981, Peru declared the 325.92 square kilometres surrounding Machu Picchu as a \"Historical Sanctuary\". Machu Picchu was designated a Unesco World Heritage Site in 1983.\n\nThe dining scene:\n\nPeru has one of the best local cuisines and also gourmet dining, and it strikes a comfortable balance between the two. You can dine well anywhere from north to south of the country, from the Amazon to Cuzco. There's a great offering of fine dining restaurants, while local rustic Peruvian fare is easy to take to as well.\n\nThe gourmet revolution in South America began about a decade ago, led by restaurateurs such as the famed Gaston Acurio and his wife Astrid in Peru, whose eponymous restaurant was named the best restaurant in the newly minted Latin America's best 50 restaurant list in 2013.\n\nGourmands will want to park themselves in Miraflores, which has the highest concentration of fine dining restaurants in Peru and, truly, dining there is an outstanding experience which is also easy on the wallet.\n\nCentral\n\nSanta Isabel 376 Miraflores Lima, Peru\n\ncentralrestaurante.com.pe\n\nCentral is like South America's answer to Noma and El Bulli, especially with the way its star chef Virgilio Martinez embraces local ingredients and makes them into food art.\n\nThe degustation menu is the highlight, and during our visit in the last quarter of 2013, it was woven around quite a compelling \"altitudinal\" story - of food dictated by the altitudes in Peru, where the Andes mountains and Incan history shape the land. The menu had ingredients starting at 10 metres below the sea, up to 4,300 metres - where the diversity of microclimates are celebrated on a plate.\n\nNine courses were presented like ikebana art. Local ingredients such as native corn, roots and nuts were totally transformed from their original form, so it was a completely new textural journey. \"Seaweed calamari\" was a colourful, diced-up mixture of squid and flowers placed on a nori sheet atop a coral rock; while native corn was transformed into a chewy cube. The Amazon river was invoked with the presentation of river fish (arapaima) on a pale green ceramic plate, with the plate's rough texture juxtaposed against the smooth strands of a pasta strung out from heart of palm and stained with the colour of a cactus flower (airampo). \"Snapshot of the sea\" was one of the most fanciful with scallops cut into cubes, and covered with chia seeds, while dollops of jus and patterned vegetable tips completed the \"d\u00e9cor\". The lamb was tender and flavourfully braised, again, plated like a work of art. The dining here is a little more about the form with perfectly executed and the fantastical food art.\n\nThe raffishly unshaven chef Martinez drops by the tables to interact with guests, and handles media interviews on-site like a pro. The degustation menu is priced at S$190 while a la carte dishes average S$30.\n\nChez Wong\n\nEnrique Leon Garcia 114\n\nSan Isidro\n\nTel: 4706217 (lunch only)\n\nThere are a couple of reasons for a visit to Chef Javier Wong's home restaurant even though he's located in an unfashionable part of town. Firstly, it's this second-generation-Asian-in-Lima's reputation as the ceviche king of Peru, and then it's for the mini performance that he puts on when slicing up giant flounders and firing the wok. Wong, with his signature beret, dark glasses, and cigarette dangling from his lips, looks like he could be a Nazi chef, but is very camera-friendly.\n\nThe walls of his home restaurant are filled with certificates, photographs and articles on the walls praising the chef and supporting his celebrity status. There isn't a menu but everyone gets a ceviche and then a hot dish - which will be served unless you indicate you only want the ceviche. Chef Wong's ceviche is no mystery at all, but he creates theatre out of it, so even though the meal is more expensive for what it's worth, you chalk it up as a most unusual dining experience.\n\nAs for the ceviche itself, his version is really quite intense - like a big band of Peruvian lemons (the magic ingredient) and onions playing a tart riot in your mouth. Chef Wong's method is to marinate the raw fish in lemon juice for mere minutes rather than hours, and he keeps it pure, straightforward and unadulterated with only a few ingredients.\n\nOur lunch came up to an extravagant S$100 per person, for the ceviche, two hot dishes, and a bottle of white wine.\n\nAstrid & Gaston\n\nMoreyra House, San Isidro\n\nAstridygaston.com/en\n\nThe best restaurant not just in Peru but in the whole of Latin America has but a discreet plaque on its door. A gathering crowd outside the restaurant just before it opens at 1pm is a give-away though, as you enter into a tranquil plush space.\n\nWe were ushered to our table in a room where the walls were lined with wine cabinets, and making our dining choices was easy enough - we picked whatever looked the most exotic. Chef Diego Munoz and his team really delivered as every dish we had was beautifully conceived and executed. Despite dishes like Peking duck-style guinea pig (cuy), one didn't feel that the dining experience was an experimental venture but one where you enjoyed the food rather than the concept.\n\nThe Peking Duck cuy featured skin that had the aerated, light and crispy texture, which is quite a feat, as we found out later when we had traditional roast cuy at another restaurant, and can attest to the otherwise chewy toughness of the skin. The crispy pork we tried was like suckling pig, contrasted nicely with wood-charred apple mash. Then we tried Peru's famous river fish, the arapaima, served panfried on saffron-infused creamed barley. Again, done beautifully. For dessert, we had a colourful box of delights served to us, with the restaurant's take on the traditional alfojar biscuit, which is like shortbread layered with dulce leche, a caramelised milk jam popular throughout South America.\n\nThe flagship restaurant was started by Peruvian Gaston Acurio with his German wife, Astrid Gutsche, in 1994, and this year, it moved to a grand bungalow in San Isidro. There are sister restaurants in Bogot\u00e1, Quito, Caracas, Buenos Aires and Santiago to as far afield as San Francisco and New York.\n\nMadam Tusan's\n\nSanta Cruz 859, Miraflores\n\nwww.madamtusan.pe\n\nThose whose taste buds need to be recalibrated with an Asian meal while on holiday will be thankful for Madam Tusan's. It's part of the Astrid & Gaston group, and the chef, Felix Loo, is a Peruvian-born Chinese who picked up his cooking skills in Guangzhou. We tried a large spread of dim sum and, though the portions were bigger than the usual Asian ones, rendering them less dainty, the tastes were good and certainly excellent for South America. The chee cheong fun had lean char siew mixed with crunchy water chestnut and biting into the wonton filling unleashed a host of savoury flavours. The calabazitas were like mini cannon balls - a sweetened, chewy, deep fried mochi ball with a savoury filling.\n\nIt was Chef Loo's \"Chinese\" ceviche that hit the sweet spot, however - being a smooth, well-balanced blend of sesame oil, soy sauce, spring onion and fresh ginger tossed yusheng. Totally like how this would be made in Asia. While Javier Wong's Peruvian ceviche can be wincingly aggressive, this was balanced and nuanced.\n\nYou can also find a wide range of Cantonese-style dishes at Madam Tusan's. Our other favourite, besides the ceviche, was the excellent quinoa, done fried rice style. Chef Loo is infectiously passionate about showcasing his take on the Peruvian Chinese \"chifa\" cuisine and his creations are definitely among the finest you'll find in that part of the world.\n\nCuzco\n\nEveryone heading to Machu Picchu goes through Cuzco, the former Inca capital located 3,400 metres above sea level; so it's also a place to acclimatise. The charming town with steep cobbled streets is the start-off point for Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu, 80 kms away, and other Inca ruins. It's not just a town to acclimatise to the higher altitude, but also works as a good weekend getaway. With the cool weather and the lights from the houses in the surrounding mountains, Cuzco has a Christmas feel all year-round.\n\nThere are tons of tour companies in Cuzco offering everything from day tours, one- to four-day hikes of the Inca trail to Machu Picchu. If you are hiking this, you have to book ahead of time because only 500 hikers get permits to hike the trails a day. Otherwise, it is also possible to take a bus up to Machu Picchu from Aguas Caliente which is a two-hour bus or train ride from Cuzco.\n\nThe dry season from June to August is the peak tourist season. You definitely don't want to hike the trails during the rainy season. If you want to avoid the crowds, you could plan to go around the fringe months of May or September\n\nThe dining scene:\n\nFor a small town, Cuzco has quite a large selection of fine-dining outlets. Most people spend only a couple of days here, but even after four days, there were outlets that we wish we had gone to if we had more time.\n\nCicciolina\n\nTriunfo 393, second floor\n\nwww.cicciolinacuzco.com\n\nCicciolina is frequently raved about as one of the best restaurants in Cuzco and it lives up to its reputation. It's located in one of the older courtyard buildings in the part of town that still has a couple of Inca walls.\n\nDiners enter the bar area with its exuberantly rustic d\u00e9cor, while the fine dining area features minimalist d\u00e9cor. It's there that we tried alpaca steaks (S$20), and found the meat very similar to duck breast in texture, but tender and rich.\n\nThe squid ink tagliolini was steeped in marine flavour - an excellent choice. The grilled octopus was a tasty starter, against the blander causa - a classic Peruvian snack which is essentially mashed potato mixed with different ingredients and fried. Dishes range from S$10-25.\n\nLimo\n\nPortal de Carnes 236\n\nPlaza de Armas\n\nwww.cuscorestaurants.com\n\nLimo is just a tad chi-chi for Cuzco, we thought, when we entered the minimalist restaurant housed in a traditional building. The food is good but formulaic. The quality is high, and it serves innovative Japanese with a Peruvian twist and vice versa, which we felt lacked soul.\n\nOtherwise. the sushi rolls are believably Japanese - quite an unusual dish to have when you're some 4,000 metres above sea level and nowhere near the sea. We also tried the alpaca kebabs (so-so) and a fried noodle dish (forgettable).\n\nLimo is part of six highly-rated and well-received restaurants in Cuzco owned by the Cusco Restaurant group - a good testimony to the high quality of F&B in Peru in general.\n\nPachapapa\n\nPlazoleta San Blas 120\n\nCusco, Peru\n\nwww.cuscorestaurants.com\n\nWe decided to hold off on one of Peru's most classic dishes until our last night in Cusco, as a celebration. Although we had the haute version in Lima, we wanted to have a sense of what traditional roast cuy (guinea pig) would be like. Pachapapa came recommended by a local shopkeeper and it also brought us to one of the hilliest, and bohemian, parts of the city. Gasping away on our uphill trek there, we were glad to walk into a lovely traditional style restaurant with a courtyard and a big clay oven outside.\n\nDecked out in rustic Peruvian textile and colours but with restrained style, the restaurant had a mom-and-pop feel (it's part of the Cusco Restaurant group) and tucked into the wood-fired guinea pig and hearty wok-fried spaghetti with vegetables. The meat of the guinea pig is quite fine and smooth, only there's not a lot of it. The wood-charred skin was very inviting, but actually tough and chewy. In the historic church in Cusco hangs a famous painting of Jesus at the Last Supper - but instead of bread and wine, it shows a roast cuy instead. So how could it not be our last supper for us as well, for our final night in Cusco?\n\nARGENTINA\n\nThe place to visit: Mendoza\n\nIf you're looking for an easy holiday filled with good food and wine, Argentina's wine region is a great place to visit over a weekend. It's easily accessible from Chile and Brazil by plane.\n\nYou can spend days visiting the wineries, especially when most of Argentina's wines don't get exported.\n\nThe dining scene:\n\nas Argentina's wine capital, Mendoza also has a dining scene which is diverse and sophisticated enough to match its quality Malbecs, Syrahs and Cabernet Sauvignons.\n\nThere is no shortage of restaurants where the average meal is executed expertly, and the restaurants at top wineries are also on par with their counterparts in France, Australia and the United States.\n\nThere are at least 1,000 wineries in Mendoza, each producing at least two to three wine labels (like the Salantein winery). Those who want to sample Argentinian wines should do it in the country, where good wine averages S$10 a bottle.\n\nMaria Antonieta\n\nBelgrano 1069, Mendoza\n\nmariaantonietaresto.com.ar\n\nMaria Antonieta was a restaurant where we dined at twice because it was simply so good, was value for money and within walking distance of our hotel. The menu was creative, and the d\u00e9cor contemporary classic French, like a smart bistro.\n\nDespite the Francophone persona the restaurant served one of the best pastas we had in the country. The freshly made pasta sheets were thin and fine, as was evidenced through the gratinated Maltagliatto pasta (like tagliatelli) with king crab that we tried the first night. Served in a pot, the king crab was flavourful although the cheese was just a tad salty, but the pasta was beautiful.\n\nThe second pasta dish we tasted was a comforting gratinated cannelloni with chicken ragout, with two pasta sheets rolled around a tomato-ish chicken stew, and again the pasta was fine and al dente. Our grilled pulpo (octopus) featured a gigantic tentacle sitting on a bed of roasted red onions and potatos, well-seared on the surface, and juicy to the bite.\n\nAnother refreshing starter was finely shaved pear tossed with burrata cheese, roughly hand torn, although the parma ham was lacklustre. The average price for the main dishes are S$12-15.\n\nThe place to visit:\n\nBariloche\n\nBariloche is Argentina's gateway to Patagonia and the city, modelled after Alpine-styled architecture, is located within the Nahuel Huapi National Park. The city emerged in the 1930s and 1940s as a top tourism centre with skiing, trekking and mountaineering facilities.\n\nThe dining scene:\n\nGiven its large tourist numbers, the restaurant food here is pretty good. With all the chocolate shops around, and even restaurants serving fondue, you could almost believe yourself to be in Switzerland.\n\nEl Boliche Viejo\n\nRuta 40, Limite entre Rio Negro\n\ny Neuquen\n\nSan Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina\n\nAll the way down south at the northern edge of Patagonia, El Boliche Viejo is one of the most charming Argentinian restaurants that is a \"must-try\" - for the history, atmosphere as well as the barbecued meats. The legend goes that Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid had used it as a hide-out (and surely grabbed a bite?) in the days of the Wild, Wild West. It's believeable that nothing much has changed since then - except a green-and-white paint job on the corrugated sheet exterior.\n\nWe ordered Patagonian lamb, of course (one portion was enough to feed three, going by Asian portions), and as we sat out in the garden, the aroma of roasting lamb wafted over us. The lamb is slow-cooked over a wood fire in a shed in the garden, and the chef carves up different parts to give them a final searing on his grill before the meat is served.\n\nEl Boliche Viejo is worth the 30-minute drive from Bariloche town, past some gorgeous Patagonian scenery, for an unpretentious, finger-licking meal - the way Argentinians have been doing for centuries.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So, we had an unusually short time and a secondary listing would have made it difficult,\" he said, at a media briefing on the logistics firm's plans for Asia here yesterday.\n\nLast year, in a bid to promote a safer market, the HKEx tightened the listing rules in relation to IPO sponsors for all applications made on or after Oct 1. This led many companies to rush out their IPO filings to escape the cumbersome new rules.\n\nWith that out of the way now, there are several factors working in favour of SGX that has led Kerry Logistics, which currently has a market value of some US$2.5 billion on the Hong Kong bourse, to mull a secondary listing here.\n\nOne key pull factor is the general notion that shares of logistics firms on SGX command better liquidity. Another appeal is that Singapore, given its strategic location in the region and major shipping lanes, is a key logistics hub.\n\n\"It's (secondary listing on SGX) not urgent but it's something we need to think about in future,\" he said.\n\nKerry Logistics last week announced a strong set of results for financial year 2013, its first since the IPO, with a 71.5 per cent jump in net profit to HK$1.83 billion (S$298.3 million).\n\nCore net profit rose 8.7 per cent from a year ago to HK$886 million after removing one-off revaluation gains from investment properties and disposal gains from its warehouse. Turnover rose 3.5 per cent to HK$20 billion.\n\nKerry Logistics manages some 39 million sq ft of logistics facilities located mostly in Asia with 11 million sq feet in mainland China.\n\nIn Singapore, which is the regional headquarters for the firm's South-east Asian operations, it opened a four-storey facility with a total area of 34,500 sq m in Tampines in April last year.\n\n\"We really like to see Singapore become more important as a node for us . . . growing the number of trucks here and making some acquisitions,\" said Mr Yeo, who was among those recently named by Pope Francis to a new Vatican Council for the Economy.\n\nThe firm is pinning its hopes on cross border e-retailing on the back of the booming e-commerce business, particularly in China, to grow further.\n\n\"E-commerce logistics is a mega trend now and is exploding throughout Asia. We are ready to ride on the rapid growth,\" he said.\n\nWithin Asean, Kerry Logistics has substantial operations in Thailand and Vietnam and expects to grow its warehouse facilities there.\n\nIs the political crisis in Thailand proving to be a dampener for Kerry Logistics' operations there?\n\n\"Thailand, where we are the largest player, is going through a fairly prolonged period of political difficulties. Nevertheless, while there's conflict, there's deep stability.\n\n\"It's almost like when you dive down two metres, the water is absolutely calm even though on the surface, there's some froth. That's our position in Thailand - it's a good country to be committed to and remain invested for the long term,\" said Mr Yeo.\n\nHas he warmed up well to the world of business which he embraced in 2012, not long after his team lost the seat in Aljunied GRC in the May 2011 General Election to cap a 23-year career in government?\n\nHis expression lights up as he replies: \"It's very exciting to learn a new field and learn from young people and discover a new frontier. It's the same reality but different perspective.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

(but) once you are in the aircraft, anything is possible,\" he told a daily press briefing. Two-thirds of those on board were Chinese, and Malaysia had asked authorities in Beijing to run an exhaustive background check on all their nationals as part of a probe into everyone aboard.\n\nYesterday, China's ambassador to Malaysia Huang Huikang said that no evidence had been found that would link anyone to a possible hijacking or terrorist attack on the jet.\n\nThe current search area, which was only properly identified after a week of fruitlessly scouring the South China Sea, is enormous - stretching from the depths of the Indian Ocean, up and over the Himalayas and into Central Asia.\n\nActing Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said that it covered a total of 2.24 million square nautical miles (7.7 million sq km) - slightly larger than Australia.\n\nChina's state media has been vocally critical of Malaysia's handling of the investigation, saying that valuable time and resources were wasted in the hours and days immediately after the aircraft disappeared on March 8.\n\nDesperate relatives of the Chinese passengers threatened to go on hunger strike yesterday, demanding that Malaysia's ambassador brief them in person.\n\nSeparately, Malaysian media reported that the plane's captain was distantly related to the daughter-in-law of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, as well as being a member of an opposition party.\n\nMr Hishammuddin said that the search for the missing aircraft should remain \"above politics\".\n\nTwenty-six countries are now involved in the search spanning a northern corridor over south and central Asia, and a southern corridor stretching deep into the southern Indian Ocean towards Australia.\n\nMalaysia has deployed its navy and air force to the southern corridor, where Australia is taking the lead in scouring a huge section of ocean off its west coast.\n\n\"It will take at least a few weeks to search the area thoroughly,\" said John Young of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.\n\nThe US Pacific Fleet withdrew a guided missile destroyer, saying that the area was simply too big for such a vessel to make an effective contribution.\n\n\"The Indian Ocean goes so far, there probably aren't enough ships and aircraft in the world to search every inch of it,\" fleet spokesman Commander William Marks told CNN. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

ING Asia Private Bank, later renamed Bank of Singapore had US$16 billion AUM.\n\nDBS's AUM will go up by about 23 per cent to S$85 billion from the current S$69 billion with the purchase, seven months after it was reported the French lender wanted to divest the business to redeploy capital into its core markets.\n\nPrivate banking in Asia is tough due to a shortage of experienced client advisers and increasingly complex regulatory demands plus very costly rentals.\n\nA McKinsey Private Banking Survey 2012 said that Asia was growing fast, but profit margins were at record lows due to high cost.\n\nRecently Singapore, the second largest wealth management centre after Switzerland, was found to be the most expensive city to live in, said the Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nThe pressure to scale up is intense.\n\nThe purchase will significantly increase the scale of the group's wealth-management business, said DBS chief executive Piyush Gupta.\n\nAt a press conference on the deal, he said: \"When we articulated our strategy four years ago, we had said wealth management will grow from 8 per cent to 12 per cent of DBS's business.\"\n\nLast year, DBS's wealth-management business came close to 12 per cent of its topline, he said. With the purchase, this will grow to 15 per cent of DBS's business in three years, he said.\n\nLast year, wealth management income of S$924 million made up 10.4 per cent of the group's S$8.9 billion.\n\nThe purchase, to be funded by cash, will likely complete in Q4. It is expected to be earnings-per-share (EPS) accretive a year after completion, DBS said.\n\nIt will lift its EPS by more than one per cent in two to three years and deliver S$50 million of profit before tax in Year 3, said Chng Sok Hui, DBS chief financial officer.\n\nOn SGPB Asia's attractions, Mr Gupta said that the bank \"has built up a nice business over the past few years . . . of ultra high net worth clients in North Asia and South-east Asia\".\n\nUltra high net worth clients generally refer to those who place at least US$30 million to US$50 million, respectively, with private banks.\n\nThe French private bank also has a proven track record in structured products and derivatives and a team of mature experienced employees, he said.\n\n\"It will lower the gap with the much larger private banks like UBS,\" he said.\n\nSwiss bank UBS is the largest private bank in Asia-Pacific, followed by Citi Private Bank and Credit Suisse, in that order according to trade journal Private Banker International in a 2012 survey.\n\nThat survey ranked DBS and Bank of Singapore ninth and 10th, respectively.\n\nUBS ended last year with Asia-Pacific AUM of 218 billion Swiss francs (S$316.13 billion) while it was 116 billion Swiss francs at Credit Suisse.\n\nIt will \"push us further away from the guy behind us\", said Tan Su Shan, DBS group head of consumer banking and wealth management, when asked if the combined AUM will catapult DBS into the top five of the AUM league.\n\nMs Tan refused to say who the guy is though it's believed to be the Bank of Singapore which ended last year with US$46 billion AUM.\n\nThe majority of the 330 people employed in Singapore and Hong Kong by SGPB Asia are expected to move over to DBS, said Ms Tan.\n\nOlivier Gougeon, SGPB Asia's regional chief executive for the Asia-Pacific, and several top managers will also join DBS's private banking business.\n\nSGPB Asia has 78 relationship managers and DBS, about 200, said Ms Tan.\n\nDBS's private banking unit now employs 533 people and has a cost-to-income ratio (CI ratio) of 62 per cent.\n\nMs Tan, when asked how the deal will affect costs, replied: \"There will be quite a lot of cost savings . . . and expect theirs (SGPB Asia's CI ratio) to come down.\"\n\nReferring to DBS's CI ration after the integration, she added: \"I will be happy with flat.\"\n\nDBS's 62 per cent CI ratio is one of the lowest in the business, she added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This has prompted the question of whether investors have been overly concerned.\n\nDespite an uptick yesterday - with DBS gaining 1.14 per cent at $15.91, OCBC 0.32 per cent at $9.35 and UOB 0.5 per cent at $20 - shares of the three lenders are still down year-to-date, with falls of 6 to 8 per cent.\n\nIn a sector research last Friday, Maybank-Kim Eng analyst Ng Wee Siang called the fears a \"storm in a teacup\".\n\n\"In our view, investor concerns over the risks posed by Singapore banks' robust loan growth in China are overdone,\" he said.\n\nCiting data from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Mr Ng noted that China is now a net borrower from Singapore, with the volume of loans into China - including interbank loans, non-bank loans and trade bills - growing at 68.7 per cent on a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) basis since 2009.\n\nTrade bills also overtook inter-bank loans in 2010 as the primary lending source, making up 65 per cent of total loans to China, up significantly from 18 per cent in the pre-global financial crisis period.\n\nThis demonstrated the Singapore banks' strategic move against foreign banks - which were hampered by a period of deleveraging during the crisis - in snagging a piece of the trade financing pie, the report showed.\n\nBut investors' fears are creeping in over China's shadow banking system.\n\nEstimates from East & Partners - a banking market and analysis firm - show that China's shadow banking represents some 40 per cent of the regulated credit market and is growing at about 28 per cent per annum.\n\nAggregate financing - which is one way to measure credit - stood at 2.58 trillion yuan (S$528.4 billion) in January, beating the last high of 2.54 trillion yuan hit in January 2013, a Bloomberg report showed.\n\nOne key concern over China's shadow banking system comes with the use of trust loans, which are effectively high-yield debt sold through unregulated trust firms. New trust loans issued in January totalled 107 billion yuan, Bloomberg reported, though it fell from 211 billion yuan a year ago.\n\nTrust loans account for about 4 per cent of rated Chinese corporates' outstanding debt now, a Moody's report said.\n\nAmong the three banks, DBS has the highest exposure to China, with China- linked loans making up 35 per cent of its loan portfolio. This is followed by OCBC's 16 per cent and UOB's 7 per cent.\n\nOCBC showed the greatest aggression in building its China-loan profile, with the CAGR since 2008 standing at 31.6 per cent. By comparison, the CAGR for loan growth in this area was at 16.4 per cent for DBS and 20.5 per cent for UOB.\n\nBut Maybank-Kim Eng's Mr Ng said Singapore's bank lending to China remains limited.\n\n\"Unlike domestic banks, Singapore banks have been very selective in their lending in China,\" he said, given that their lending franchise is not as well-recognised as their domestic counterparts.\n\nSingapore banks' balance sheets are also smaller by comparison.\n\n\"Given the rapid growth of trade between Asean and China, trade finance loans in Asia look set to continue to expand rapidly,\" said Mr Ng.\n\n\"A growing pie is always good news for banks as there is less reason for them to go down the risk curve to grow their loans.\"\n\nFurthermore, Singapore-domiciled entities have been the target for trade loans, which provide a natural hedge given that they are short term in nature. Some 70 per cent of DBS's trade loans to China are on a six-month basis.\n\n\"A short duration means banks are able to reduce their exposure to trade loans quickly, if required. We also note that the majority of such loans are backed by bank guarantees,\" Mr Ng said.\n\nLooking at DBS specifically, Mr Ng noted that half of the bank's total trade loans of $50 billion as at end-2013 were backed by bank guarantees.\n\nDBS has also focused on a list of \"internally-generated prospective clients of 1,000 Chinese companies\" that are considered long-term winners in the country.\n\nMaybank-Kim Eng maintained its \"overweight\" rating on the sector, with DBS as its top sector pick because \"it is best-positioned to take advantage of a rising interest rate environment\". The report has a \"buy\" on DBS and UOB and a \"hold\" on OCBC.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This has triggered fears that Japan's external payments position could end up in deficit for the current fiscal year as a whole. This would, in turn, indicate that Japan was becoming a net importer of capital on a long-term basis, which could send a \"sell\" signal to investors in Japanese government bonds at a time when government borrowing is at the highest among advanced economies, some economists say.\n\nNews of the latest current account deficit - the fourth consecutive monthly deficit - came as the government revised down earlier estimates of gross domestic product growth in the fourth quarter of calendar 2013 from an annual one per cent to 0.7 per cent.\n\nReflecting the continuing deterioration in Japan's balance-of-payments position, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told Parliament yesterday that it was \"necessary to build a strong economy to avoid a sharp change in the current account balance\". He urged measures such as taking advantage of growth in emerging Asian economies to boost exports, Kyodo news service reported, but trade and inflation data released at the weekend pointed to a slowing in the world's leading emerging economy, China, which is also Japan's largest single trading partner.\n\nMr Abe also told Parliament yesterday that Japan must establish a responsible energy policy, which analysts said reflected his anxiety about getting some of the nation's 50 idled nuclear reactors back on line to stem the runaway rise in fuel import costs.\n\nJapan's total imports in January leapt by just over 30 per cent in value terms, compared with a year earlier, to nearly 7.9 trillion yen, owing largely to the surging costs of imported fuels; exports climbed by 16.7 per cent to around 5.5 trillion yen, the Japanese finance ministry said yesterday. This created a record overall trade deficit of 2.35 trillion yen, which even the customary net surplus on Japanese investments overseas, which forms part of the current account balance, could not compensate for. This has created the largest current account deficit Japan has seen since records began in 1985.\n\nThe yen was down nearly 17 per cent against the dollar in January, compared with a year earlier.\n\nWhat is most worrying for Mr Abe is that this sharp weakening, which came about under the banner of \"Abenomics\", is being seen increasingly as a negative factor for Japan's economy.\n\nThe weaker currency has boosted Japanese exports and the earnings of Japanese corporations when translated into yen, but not by a sufficient extent to compensate for the sharply higher costs of imported fuel and other inputs required by industrial (and to some extent, private) consumers.\n\nThe Bank of Japan's policy of dramatic monetary easing under its governor Haruhiko Kuroda, an Abe appointee, is coming under increasingly harsh scrutiny because of its impact on the yen. The central bank's latest Policy Board meeting due to end today is thus being closely watched.\n\nThe issues involved are highly sensitive politically for Mr Abe, whose popularity rating with voters has been high until now, mainly as a result of the improvement in Japan's economy since he came to power at the end of 2012.\n\nSome economists foresee further falls in the yen if Japan's current account deficit remains. Kenji Yumoto, the vice-chairman of the Japan Research Institute, told Kyodo that this could bring about high cost-push inflation: \"It is clear that such inflation is not favourable to consumers.\"\n\nFor the government, an even bigger fear is of rising interest rates in Japan, if domestic or foreign funds begin to flow out of Japanese government bonds. This could abort the nation's economic recovery or even create a crisis in the bond market, some suggest.\n\nHowever, Japan's former vice-finance minister for international finance Eisuke Sakaibara told The Business Times recently that Japan's overall external financial position is strong enough to ward off any danger of a Japanese government bond market collapse for years yet while the economy recovers.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By revamping property taxes - and taking on some of New York's richest residents - he could get eight times as much.\n\nMr De Blasio, a self-described progressive Democrat, was elected on a promise to reduce income inequality in a city where the richest one per cent took home almost 40 per cent of all earnings in 2012.\n\nNew York's property tax structure does little to reduce that divide and may even widen it.\n\nThe real estate levy, the city's biggest revenue source, uses a methodology that undervalues condominiums on Park Avenue, Central Park West and other enclaves of the wealthy; limits tax increases for owners in brownstone neighbourhoods such as Greenwich Village and Park Slope; and shifts the heaviest burden to renters, many of them poor.\n\nWhile almost half of all city property value belongs to owners of one-, two- and three-family houses, they pay only 15 per cent of the US$21 billion in annual real estate taxes, according to the Citizens Budget Commission (CBC), a business- backed watchdog. Making the system fairer could raise more than US$4 billion a year, the New York- based group said.\n\n\"The city's property tax is complicated and riddled with inequities,\" said Carol Kellermann, president of the CBC, which researches the finances and management of the city and state. \"We can generate more revenue from this tax simply by making it more transparent and equitable, without having to raise rates.\"\n\nFor example, a four-bedroom penthouse condo at 15 Central Park West with two fireplaces and a library sold for US$88 million in 2012. That gave it an effective tax rate, or the levy divided by the property's market value, of 0.07 per cent. In Brooklyn's Crown Heights, a less affluent neighbourhood, a house that sold for US$989,000 in August had an effective rate of 0.6 per cent.\n\nThe city average for homeowners is 0.8 per cent, according to a report prepared for the CBC by Andrew Hayashi, a professor at the University of Virginia's School of Law in Charlottesville. Rental buildings with more than 11 units bear the brunt, paying 4.72 per cent.\n\nNew York City's property tax structure traces its roots to 1975, when the state's highest court ruled that the decades-long practice of allowing assessors latitude in valuations was illegal. The court said favourable treatment of houses must end, and that all real estate should be assessed at 100 per cent of market value.\n\nAfter six years of delays and complaints from homeowners, the state legislature in 1981 passed a new law that essentially allowed all municipalities to continue using the old method.\n\nFor New York City and neighbouring Nassau County, the law created four classes of property - one- to three-family homes, apartment buildings, utilities and commercial property - with each taxed under different formulas.\n\nThe intent was to lock in the percentage of total property tax levy paid by each class at the 1981 level. That gave homeowners an advantage because historically they had received bigger breaks than other properties.\n\nFor homeowners, assessment increases were capped at 6 per cent in a single year and 20 per cent over five, regardless of rising market value.\n\nThe state also required the city to value co-ops and condos, in which residents own their units or shares in the building, like less valuable rental property.\n\nIn the ensuing decades, the rules and New York's soaring real estate values created wide disparities between market and assessed value. The system is now tilted even more against large rental buildings than it was in 1981.\n\nIn 1996, in response to complaints from condos and co-ops, the state passed an abatement programme reducing their taxes by as much as 25 per cent.\n\nCritics say the system benefits wealthy homeowners at the expense of poor and middle-class renters, and prevents the city from reaping billions in tax revenue. The city's Rent Guidelines Board estimates that property taxes represent 30 per cent of an apartment building's operating costs, which are passed through to tenants.\n\nThree decades after the law was put in place, New York is a much different place. Then, the city was emerging from a brush with bankruptcy, subways were covered with graffiti and crime was rampant. In the 1970s, New York lost 10 per cent of its population, census data show.\n\nIn the next 20 years, as President Ronald Reagan lowered taxes on incomes and capital gains and bankers like Michael Milken and Lewis Ranieri pioneered ways to package corporate and mortgage debt, employment on Wall Street rose to a peak of 200,000 in 2000.\n\nWall Street bonuses hit a record US$34.3 billion in 2006, compared with about US$2.1 billion in 1990, according to the state comptroller's office. Average wages in the securities industry rose more than 10-fold to US$360,000 in 2012 from 1981, fuelling the real estate boom.\n\nThe distortions in the property tax system are greatest at the highest strata. For instance, when former Citigroup Inc chairman Sanford Weill sold that 6,744 square foot condo at 15 Central Park West for US$88 million, the city valued it at only US$2.8 million. The entire 201-unit building, which is also home to rock musician Sting and hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb, was valued at US$242.6 million.\n\nMr Weill's real estate taxes were US$143,513, according to a June 2011 tax statement. The bill was cut in half to US$59,490 because residents of 15 Central Park West also receive tax abatements under a programme where developers subsidise affordable housing.\n\nCentral Park West owners aren't alone in reaping benefits from the system. A 2006 report by the Independent Budget Office (IBO), a non-partisan fiscal watchdog funded by the city, found that the average co-op and condo on the Upper West Side of Manhattan was undervalued by 81 per cent.\n\nBy contrast, New York's large rental properties are subject to the second-highest taxes among apartment buildings in the 50 largest US cities, according to a 2011 report by New York University's Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy.\n\nUsing a single tax rate and market values would result in a levy cut for such buildings averaging US$1,237 to US$1,854 per apartment per year, the IBO said its 2006 report.\n\nCondos and co-ops in large buildings would face average increases of US$428 to US$751 per unit, while homeowners would see bills rise by US$2,039.\n\nMr De Blasio, 52, is open to studying changes to the system, said Marti Adams, a spokeswoman.\n\n\"It is clear that this is an issue, particularly in neighbourhoods where property values have not reflected the gains the city has made in the decades since Albany created the rules,\" she said.\n\nRosa Rodriguez, a single mother and nurse who lives in an apartment in Queens, and Ernest Robinson, a renter in the Bronx, aren't waiting for government officials to act.\n\nLast month, they filed a class-action lawsuit in the state Supreme Court in Manhattan claiming that black and Hispanic renters bear the burden of higher real estate taxes.\n\nThe plaintiffs are seeking a court order forcing the city and state to equalise the system.\n\n\"Why should those that make less pay more?\" said Ms Rodriguez, 40, who grew up in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. She said neighbours had to move because they couldn't keep up with rising rents.\n\nBlacks and Hispanics are more likely to live in rental buildings with 11 or more units, according to the lawsuit.\n\nJasmine Carayol, a spokeswoman for the city Law Department, and Geoff Gloak, a spokesman for the state Taxation and Finance Department, said they were reviewing the case.\n\nThe assessment caps in the 1981 law are why Brooklyn's Park Slope, where Mr De Blasio and many other white-collar professionals live, has the lowest effective tax rate among all of New York's 59 community districts, according to the Furman Center. The average price of a home there has risen 89 per cent in the past decade, according to New York- based real estate brokerage MNS.\n\nRemoving caps on homeowners would raise US$936 million in the next fiscal year, according to the Citizens Budget Commission. Removing caps and other breaks for all properties would yield more than US$4 billion in 2015.\n\nRevamping the structure absent a court order would be difficult. State legislators and the governor would have to approve it, and owners of homes, condos and co-ops - who benefit from the system and are more likely to vote than renters - form a potent opposition. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

So it is good that Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has moved to depoliticise the water woes of Selangor state, one of the states worst affected by the lack of rainfall. Last week, his administration signed a pact with that opposition-run state to restructure its water industry. The Selangor government and the water supply companies (some of which are linked to the federally ruling Barisan Nasional coalition) have been blaming each other for supply difficulties. Now, under the deal, the state will take over the four water firms for RM9.65 billion (S$3.74 billion). As matters related to water supply fall under state jurisdiction in Malaysia, the Najib administration has also secured the state's approval to build a RM3.8 billion water treatment plant to ensure adequate supplies until 2025.\n\nHowever, the immediate problems of this long, dry spell remain. Water is being rationed in parts of the state because water tables in dams have dropped to crisis levels. Other Malaysian west coast states have also signalled the possibility of water rationing if the drought does not end. In Johor, Batu Pahat and Pontian have been put on alert for water rationing. It has been reported that several dams in the southern-most state are just 5 per cent short of reaching their crisis levels. Malaysia's meteorology office has warned that no significant rainfall can be expected until the middle of this month at the earliest in the west coast states.\n\nWorse, the drought may be a harbinger of the El Nino weather phenomenon. Australia's Bureau of Meteorology has forecast an El Nino weather pattern in the coming months. Its modelling shows that Pacific Ocean temperatures would be approaching or exceeding El Nino thresholds in the southern hemisphere winter.\n\nMalaysia began cloud seeding earlier this week and there have been some rains in parts of Selangor and Kuala Lumpur, but it is too early to say if dammed water levels have gone up. However, it must be stressed that not every part of the country is affected. Peninsular Malaysia receives average rainfall of 2,500 mm a year. During the north-east monsoon season, the east coast of the peninsula frequently experiences widespread floods. Over the years there have been proposals on how the economically fast-growing west coast states should pool their resources - with the help of federal authorities - to find a way to capture and store some of that water in co-operation with their eastern neighbours. But the political will seemed to have been lacking. In the meantime, population growth and industrial development - Selangor accounts for more then 20 per cent of Malaysia's GDP - have overwhelmed such piecemeal improvements to the water supply system that have been made over the years.\n\nClearly then, a lack of long-term planning and a consequent lack of infrastructure development have contributed to current difficulties. It must be hoped now, with politics put to one side, an earnest effort will be made to manage Malaysia's abundant water resources.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Employers added 175,000 jobs to their payrolls last month after creating 129,000 new positions in January, the Labor Department said yesterday. The unemployment rate, however, rose to 6.7 per cent from a five-year low of 6.6 per cent.\n\n\"This bodes well for the economy since there were massive headwinds against it and there had been some data before this indicating that it wouldn't be so strong,\" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive at Sarhan Capital in New York.\n\nUS stock prices rose on the data, while prices for US government debt fell. The US dollar hit a six-week high against the yen.\n\nUnseasonably cold and snowy winter weather has disrupted economic activity in much of the United States. With snow and ice covering densely populated areas during the week employers were surveyed for February payrolls, another month of sub-par job growth had been expected.\n\nEconomists had forecast nonfarm payrolls rising 149,000 and the unemployment rate to hold steady at 6.6 per cent.\n\nThe harsh weather cut into the length of the average workweek in February, which hit its lowest level since January 2011.\n\nThe smaller survey of households from which the unemployment rate is derived showed 6.9 million people with jobs reported they were working part-time because of the weather. That was the highest reading for February since the series started in 1978.\n\nThe survey also showed 601,000 people with jobs stayed at home because of the bad weather last month, the highest level for February since 2010.\n\nNonfarm payrolls averaged about 205,000 new jobs per month in the first 11 months of 2013, but that figure dropped to just 129,000 for December, January and February as the bad weather disrupted economic activity.\n\nMost economists expect the Fed will announce further cuts in its stimulus at its next meeting on March 18-19.\n\nThe US trade deficit, meanwhile, was little changed in January as exports and imports grew, a sign economies throughout the globe are picking up.\n\nThe gap widened by 0.3 per cent to US$39.1 billion from US$39 billion in the prior month that was larger than previously estimated, Commerce Department figures showed yesterday.

Yet it is also the least regulated. As it takes place outside exchanges, the potential for manipulation, as alleged in a Bloomberg report last June, is huge. The largest banks are market makers themselves, who buy and sell on clients' behalf and also on their own accounts. The conflicts of interest are obvious, and the so-called code of ethics or best practices may not be worth the paper they are printed on. Absent regulation, the alleged practice of front-running, where a dealer favours trades for selected clients or for himself at the expense of others, should perhaps not be surprising. But what was also egregious was that trade information was apparently shared among dealers and counterparties through chatrooms and instant messaging.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The coupling of restaurant and covert lounge concepts isn't new, but the pace at which it's growing is, especially in recent months. Prohibition era-themed restaurant The Black Swan and its mezzanine lounge The Powder Room, and Japanese izakaya Izy and their curtained-off backroom bar Cache set things in motion late last year. The trend continues unabated this year with brand new dual-concept dining spots such as Nuvo, Shinkansen and The Secret Mermaid, The Pecking Order and The Men's Room, and Cedar Grill and The Red Room.\n\nPointing to restaurants in the United Kingdom such as Sushisamba, Nobu and Aqua Nueva, which all comprise restaurants and lounges with distinct personalities within the same space, Vijay Pillai says its a \"globally trending concept\" that would inevitably find its way to Singapore.\n\nMr Pillai is the CEO of the F&B arm of Caerus Holdings, which owns Japanese-Italian restaurant Nuvo in Marina Square.

Closed on Tues.\n\nLIKE the giant Merlion, Quayside Isle in Sentosa Cove has that aura of artifice about it that makes it difficult to see it as a serious dining destination. Pretty little eateries, all in a row, in a picturesque marina setting that look good on the resume of a hipster foodie or the post-its on the fridges of well-heeled residents.\n\nWhile the likes of Saint Pierre and Chinese restaurant Blue Lobster - with its signature chilli crab and pomelo - have done their bit in raising the credibility of the complex, the self-styled Greek taverna Mykonos on the Bay always seemed more like a typical expat magnet than a serious Mediterranean concept. Kitschy sea-shell decor, basic white tables, smiley but slightly clueless staff and barely any Asian customers never quite inspired confidence, even though Mykonos has been around since December.\n\nBut you know what they say about first impressions and stereotypes. In this case, we're guilty as charged as Mykonos proves that you can't judge a restaurant from its tacky travel posters.\n\nMuch of the credit goes to the bona fide Greek chef you can see calmly and methodically toiling away at the back of the breezy, open eatery, dispensing unpretentious Mediterranean standards at a steady clip with a confident and experienced hand. There's solid foundation behind his cooking, with barely a false note as he nails down a happy balance of flavours, textures and seasonings.\n\nThe poster sea creature of Greek cooking - the octopus - doesn't get short shrift here. Grilled and marinated octopus ($21.90) is done hot and cold - tender, yielding bites of char-grilled tentacle on salad greens tossed in a sweet balsamic dressing, and a slightly more tart mixture of chopped up mollusc and peppers in vinaigrette.\n\nThis pleasing starter is well matched by the unctuous, guilty pleasure that is graviera saganaki ($15.90) or pan-fried slabs of Greek cheese that's crisp on the outside and meltingly gooey-chewy within. Graviera is a pretty common Greek cheese - second only to feta - which tastes like a riper Gouda or Gruyere but without crossing the line into stinky cheese territory. To temper the rich cheesiness, a red vinegar glaze made with traditional uozo liqueur is drizzled over the cheese for colour and acidity.\n\nThe Gyros platter ($27.50) looks like a big mess of dry meat shavings and french fries, but dig into it and you'll find a generous pile of well-marinated, tender grilled pork belly haphazardly sliced and hiding atop a refreshing mound of tzatziki or cucumber yoghurt, toasted pita wedges and skinny chilli-dusted shoestring fries. There doesn't seem to be any delicate way of eating this apart from stabbing with your cutlery or using your fingers to enjoy the sticky-tender pork with its gelatinous skin, cooling yoghurt and spicy potatoes that taste pretty good even when cold.\n\nIf the grilled seafood or meat platter seems too ambitious for your appetite, the grilled sea bream ($43.50) impresses with its perfectly grilled, almost crusty exterior and creamy flesh within. We pretty much luck out as the fish is super-fresh and meaty, the slight over-seasoning on the surface not detracting from the sweetness of the meat. The side dish of crushed potatoes and beetroot is no afterthought and is delicious with its light lemony dressing, as is the briny fish roe enhanced mayonnaise that complements the fish.\n\nWith every dish a lucky pick for us, the baklava registers a slight dip on the enjoyment meter. Rather than shattering-crisp filo layers ($15.90), you get a flimsy strudel filled with chocolate and nuts, served with vanilla ice cream and cinnamon scented crumbs.\n\nWhile we don't quite appreciate the Germanic slant, we're more open to the fact that Mykonos is actually Italian-owned - by the folks behind Cugini and Sole Pomodoro. With the Spanish Los Primos also under its wing, it looks like they've got the Mediterranean well covered. And in Mykonos's case, raised the cache of Quayside Isle by another notch.\n\nRating:\n\n7\n\nWHAT OUR RATINGS MEAN\n\n10: The ultimate dining experience\n\n9-9.5: Sublime\n\n8-8.5: Excellent\n\n7-7.5: Good to very good\n\n6-6.5: Promising\n\n5-5.5: Average\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Analysis by asset manager BlackRock of last year's hedge fund performance underlines the wide divergence in perfomance. An investor who chose the most successful hedge fund strategy last year - equity hedge, for example - could have seen outperformance, or alpha, of around 20 per cent in the best performing funds or minus 15 per cent in the worst.\n\nEven the top funds would have lagged a pound sterling, dollar or euro invested in a major index such as the Standard & Poor's 500, up 30 per cent.\n\nBut pension funds and others with a lower risk threshold also use hedge funds because their greater tactical scope adds to the options for achieving less volatile, and in some cases more profitable returns than just tracking the market. \"Last year, you could just buy beta (track the market) in both equities and credit, and sell gold and Bunds. This year . . . it's much more complicated,\" said Philippe Ferreira, head of research, alternative investments, at Lyxor AM. \"In this context, investing in hedge funds is a good way to get protection and decorrelation with the market, and in that sense hedge fund performance in January showed they did just that: strategies with less directionality producing positive results while stock indices fell.\"\n\nIn fund management overall, market-tracking \"passive\" strategies are expected to grab market share from \"active\" strategies by 2020, a recent study from consultants PwC found. But assets under management in alternative investments, which include hedge funds, will more than double to US$13 trillion, PwC said.\n\nThe wide spread of absolute returns found in the BlackRock analysis is even more marked when comparing the amount of outperformance generated by the funds.\n\nUsing the example of last year's top returning strategy, equity hedge, for example, the study found that the average fund actually detracted from the performance, while strategies such as event-driven added nearly 4 per cent of alpha.- Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom: survey\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

However, results vary from survey to survey. In another recent one by the real estate firm Savills released just before the EIU's, Hong Kong was named the most expensive city in the world in which to locate employees; Singapore came in 5th. A survey by the research firm Mercer focused on expatriate living costs, released in July 2013, again ranked Singapore fifth; the most expensive turned out to be - few would have guessed it - Luanda in Angola.\n\nBut now, to be ranked No 1 for living costs by the EIU (compared with 18th a decade ago by the same organisation), ahead of cities such as Paris, Oslo and Zurich and 127 others, comes as something of a surprise. However, this startling result is subject to several caveats.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A deal would value Wing Hang at about 1.9 times book value, according to one of the sources. Wing Hang shares, which rallied earlier, were suspended in Hong Kong.\n\nA multiple of 1.9 times last year's book would value Wing Hang at about HK$41.2 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. OCBC, which entered exclusive talks with Wing Hang's largest shareholders last year, said it held \"informal discussions\" with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority ahead of the potential offer.\n\nThe valuation would be a \"fairly steep price, and it's not easy to make it accretive\", Kenneth Ng, a Singapore-based analyst at CIMB-GK Securities Pte, said. \"At this price, the winners will be the selling shareholders.\"\n\nSouth-east Asia's second-largest lender is seeking to gain a foothold in the Chinese banking hub as the city's role in cross-border financing expands. The transaction would follow Yue Xiu Group's US$1.5 billion offer to buy a majority stake in family- owned Chong Hing Bank Ltd, which was approved by the HKMA on Jan 9.\n\nShares of Wing Hang rose as much as 9.3 per cent yesterday, the most in more than six months, before being suspended from trading at 2.24 pm pending an announcement under Hong Kong's takeovers code. OCBC shares fell 1.1 per cent at S$9.51 before being suspended from trading at 2.31pm in Singapore.\n\nSingapore-based OCBC said last month that it would extend exclusive talks on a possible offer through March 31. Koh Ching Ching, a spokeswoman for OCBC, declined to comment. The HKMA said in an emailed statement that it does not comment on matters relating to individual institutions.\n\nCherry Yung, a Hong Kong- based spokeswoman for Wing Hang, declined to comment and referred to the lender's previous announcement.\n\nWing Hang said on Sept 16 that its shareholders were in talks to sell their stake. Chairman Patrick Fung's family, its affiliates and Bank of New York Mellon Corp together hold about 45 per cent of the shares, which would require a buyout bid, the bank said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange that day.\n\nHong Kong lenders are proving attractive to mainland companies seeking expansion abroad and foreign firms eyeing the Chinese market.\n\nWing Hang would give OCBC a network of about 70 branches spanning Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China. Its presence across southern China's Pearl River Delta makes it a more attractive target than other smaller family-owned banks in the city, Grace Wu, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong Ltd, said.

It was a re-tap of a $200 million bond sold last month, bringing the issuance to a combined $310 million. DBS Bank and OCBC Bank handled the sale.\n\nA re-tap refers to a deal which has been expanded with the same maturity and coupon dates.\n\nA re-tap could be due to a company needing more funds at a later stage, said Clifford Lee, DBS head of fixed income.\n\n\"A re-tap can be more effective than a fresh new issue as this follow-up funding need might not be big enough for a standalone issue and proper secondary market liquidity,\" he said.\n\n\"More demand might have been developed in the market after the initial issue, substantiated by good secondary market flows, that allow for more bonds to be issued now, which may not have been possible before,\" added Mr Lee.\n\nDBS yesterday also sold $100 million of three-year bonds at 4 per cent for integrated logistics player CWT Ltd. It was issued under CWT's $500 million multi-currency debt issuance programme.\n\nDemand for corporate bonds pushed the Markit iBoxx SGD corporate total return index to 106.2620 on March 3, yet another high. The index which measures bond prices and accumulated coupon payments is up 1.154 per cent year to date.\n\nThe bond market's strength is partly due to a lack of supply from big issuers.\n\nOf the 25 deals year to date totalling$4.326 billion, DBS was involved in 13 issues worth $1.78 billion.\n\nFor the same period last year, total issuance volume was $3.575 billion from 22 deals.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It calls for replacing defective software with a new, improved version.\n\nThe rule, the fourth such directive involving the 747-8, directly affects seven aeroplanes in the US, the FAA said. If adopted internationally, the rule would cover a larger number. Boeing's website said that it had delivered 66 of the four-engine jets, the company's largest, to customers worldwide since the model was introduced in October 2011.\n\nThe problem never caused a problem in flight, Boeing said. Because of the seriousness of the safety issues, the directive takes effect on April 9, skipping the usual comment period, although comments can still be submitted, the FAA said. Boeing said that data analysis indicated a potential problem, and it advised customers last year to update the software. It said that it believed the majority of operators had already done so. The risk of failure was \"extremely remote\", Boeing said.\n\nGE said that it owned the software and jointly analysed it with Boeing, but the planemaker decided to recommend the software change to customers.\n\nAccording to the FAA, the risk arises when a plane is changing back into \"air mode\" while performing a \"rejected or bounced landing\". That change halts hydraulic pressure used to stow the engine thrust reversers, which slow the plane on landing, the agency said.\n\nWithout hydraulic pressure, the reversers may not stow fully and might redeploy, which \"could result in inadequate climb performance at an altitude insufficient for recovery, and consequent uncontrolled flight into terrain,\" the FAA said.- Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

There were a lot of big short positions out there. Some of those shorts got closed, but there wasn't enough liquidity to close all those positions, so there was a lot of pain on Monday,\" the prop-trader said.\n\nMarket participants said the situation began to ease by Tuesday when it became clear that Europe's high gas storage levels would be able to deal with a short-term Russian supply cut, which itself has since been deemed unlikely.\n\n\"Those that are still short because they couldn't close their positions due to low liquidity will sigh with relief, because if Russia doesn't cut supplies there is still downward space in gas prices and opportunity for short players,\" a utility trader said.\n\nThe European Union meanwhile said it is ready to provide 11 billion euros (S$19.2 billion) of financial support to Ukraine over the next couple of years via a series of loans and grants.\n\nThe announcement comes a day after the United States offered US$1 billion in loan guarantees and said it would send technical experts to Ukraine to advise its central bank and finance ministry on how to tackle economic difficulties.\n\nOn the political front, US Secretary of State John Kerry yesterday pressed Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to hold face-to-face talks with his counterpart from the new Ukrainian government on the Crimea crisis.\n\nMr Kerry, who has worked closely with Mr Lavrov on Syria, made the appeal on the sidelines of an international meeting on Lebanon here.\n\n\"Secretary Kerry had a brief pull aside discussion with Foreign Minister Lavrov after the larger sideline discussion they had with other foreign ministers,\" a senior State Department official said. \"The Secretary urged direct talks between Russia and Ukraine. They will be meeting again in approximately an hour to continue their discussions.\" - Reuters, AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

Last May, Manchester United was riding high in the English Premier League.\n\nAs the club's long-serving manager Alex Ferguson bowed out of the sport on a high by guiding the swashbuckling Red Devils to a record-breaking 20th league title - winning the crown at a canter, no less - few would have imagined the disaster that was soon to follow.\n\nIn all fairness, even the most ardent supporters would not have realistically expected the team to retain the championship under new boss David Moyes, a Scot handpicked for the job by Ferguson himself.\n\nIt is the club's sharp decline that has many people flummoxed. United now languishes in seventh spot, way behind leaders Chelsea and arch-rivals Liverpool and Manchester City, and two places lower than Moyes' former club, Everton.\n\nWith a paltry 51 points from 31 games, United is guaranteed to finish with its lowest points total in the history of the Premier League.\n\nThe results on the pitch are both disappointing and puzzling. Moyes essentially took charge of the exact same squad of players - yes, the team was an ageing one but none of them departed last season after Ferguson stepped down.\n\nWhere Moyes bungled early on was to dilly-dally in last summer's transfer window. With just hours left before the transfer deadline closed, United paid an exorbitant amount to recruit Marouane Fellaini. The Belgian midfielder has failed to impress and looks a shadow of the man who tormented others when he was at Everton.\n\nJuan Mata joined the ranks in January for a club record fee. The Spaniard hasn't quite settled down into his stride yet, only showing his talents in glimpses. He can be a good fit for United, but only if Moyes can deploy him in his favourite No 10 position and not anywhere else.\n\nThirteen losses in all competitions, even in a transition year, has been difficult to stomach. Manchester United fans are used to the team setting records, but not the kind they are experiencing of late.\n\nIt's the first time United have lost home and away to Liverpool and Manchester City in the same season since the Premier League was launched 22 years ago.\n\nThe club's Old Trafford stadium, which used to be an intimidating fortress under the Ferguson era, has been the scene of some quite painful defeats this term. Six losses at home in the league - seven, if you count the embarrassing exit in the FA Cup to Swansea City - are more than the past three seasons combined.\n\nIn the League Cup semi-final, the Red Devils were just seconds away from beating Sunderland to reach the final, only to concede a clumsy last-minute goal and suffer a shock elimination on penalty kicks.\n\nThere are many, many more humiliating results that would require much more than this entire page to list them all.\n\nMoyes still firmly believes his job and lucrative six-year contract are safe but others aren't quite so sure. If some reports in the British media are to be believed, the 50-year-old Scot is a dead man walking, with his relationship with the club's owners, the Glazer family, said to be at breaking point.\n\nThe fans, who have largely backed Moyes so far, seem to be slowly turning on him. Last Tuesday, after the 0-3 defeat to City, stewards at Old Trafford had to protect a large banner with Moyes' face from angry fans who wanted it torn down.\n\nSome supporters are planning a banner fly-past ahead of tonight's game against Aston Villa to call for Moyes' removal. The \"Wrong one - Moyes\" banner will be flown over the stadium for 15 minutes.\n\nThere's even a brewing story about how David Beckham, Ryan Giggs and the rest of the Class of '92 under Ferguson are part of a consortium planning to stage an audacious buyout of the Glazers' 90 per cent stake in Manchester United.\n\nMoyes will never enjoy the same luxury of time that Ferguson did when he struggled in his early years at the club back in the late-1980s. Manchester United now has a global fan base of 659 million people and there are millions of shareholders to answer to. Anything and everything the club does, both on and off the pitch, will come under round-the-clock scrutiny.\n\nAfter every defeat, Moyes claims he has a way to get out of the mess. No one quite knows what he has up his sleeve, but for his sake, it had better be a really good plan.\n\nWith United long out of the running for any domestic honours, there is still the Champions League quarter-finals to look forward to. Even then, many are not too hopeful of progress given that United must first get past the defending champion Bayern Munich over two legs starting next Wednesday.\n\nIf the Red Devils don't raise their game fast enough, the in-form Bayern - recently crowned German league champions - could well rack up a tennis score when all is said and done.\n\nIf ever Moyes had a Plan B, now would be as good a time as any to fish it out and pray hard that it works.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.
