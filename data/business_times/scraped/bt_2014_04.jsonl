Only better employers can attract and retain better people and grow more profitably,\" he said.\n\nHis comments come as the ongoing tightening of the labour market is spurring a much faster pace of economic restructuring.\n\nOn its part, the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) has promised to push on with its plan to upgrade skills, create more good jobs for workers, and continue to grow the economic pie such that there is more to go around.\n\n\"This labour market tightness is not something that we can hope will go away. It won't go away,\" Mr Lim, NTUC's secretary- general, told reporters during a briefing to expand on the points in his May Day Message.\n\nThe Singapore economy is going through a transition towards one driven by productivity and innovation, rather than by boosting its manpower numbers.\n\nThis labour restructuring is causing much \"stress\" to all parties: businesses, workers, unions and the government.\n\nLast year, Mr Lim noted how Singapore's total manpower grew 4 per cent, but productivity growth remained flat at zero per cent.\n\n\"The moment we fail in our restructuring, we will lose our competitiveness and growth. That's when job creation will slow down as well,\" he warned.\n\nHe painted a bleak scenario for Singapore where rank-and-file workers are replaced by robots; PMEs (professionals, managers and executives) are underemployed; mature workers cannot fit into workplaces because they are not age- friendly; working parents are unable to have a good work-life balance; and low- wage workers are stuck in a world of cheap-sourcing.\n\n\"If we allow these to happen, we will face higher unemployment - not just because of a job shortage, but also because of job and worker mismatches,\" said Mr Lim. Singapore should never take the healthy jobs situation that it has today for granted, he added.\n\nPreviously, a person had to compete with workers from other countries. Now, there is the added stress of competing with the advances of technology as well, as there is a fear that more employers will make use of robots to replace - not complement - their workers, he said.\n\nBesides the workers and employers, Mr Lim said that customers and consumers, too, have to play their part in this ongoing effort to restructure the economy.\n\n\"The globalised world thrives on mutual dependency, mutual support and mutual acceptance. Good services beget good customers, and good customers beget good services,\" he said.\n\n\"As we strive to become a more advanced economy, we must also strive to be a nation of better customers and better people.\"\n\nOverall, Mr Lim said Singapore's economic growth remains healthy with a tight labour market. Wages have continued to move up faster than inflation.\n\nDescribing these achievements as hard- earned, he took the opportunity to pay tribute to workers and the tripartite partners for their \"hard work, resilience and unity\".\n\n\"Even though we celebrate May Day amid labour shortages, we should be mindful that good jobs will always be the best welfare, and full employment the best protection for our workers, both young and old,\" said Mr Lim.\n\nSeparately, NTUC president Diana Chia said in her May Day Message that Singapore's unionisation rates are growing, at a time when many countries are experiencing the opposite.\n\nSingapore's unionisation rate of resident workers rose 27 per cent last year, up from 20 per cent in 2002.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Bus revenue climbed 4.9 per cent but the bottom line was an operating loss of $4.5 million.\n\nThe star performer was the non-fare business, which includes taxis, advertising, rental and engineering services. Its revenue increased 4 per cent to $78.7 million, with operating profit up 265 per cent at $25.9 million.\n\nStaff costs for the final quarter were stable at $111.5 million but depreciation rose 18.4 per cent to $47.8 million. Energy costs slipped 6.8 per cent to $38.1 million.\n\nEarnings per share came to 1.1 cents, against a loss per share of 0.8 cent in the corresponding period a year ago.\n\nFor the full year, SMRT's net profit fell 25.7 per cent to $61.9 million despite a 4 per cent increase in revenue to $1.16 billion. The company said that operating profit for the non-fare business came in 12.4 per cent higher at $106.4 million, driven mostly by growth in the taxi business, as well as commercial and engineering services.\n\nTaxi operating profit rose 49.7 per cent to $9.6 million due to higher rental contribution from a newer fleet and lower diesel tax because of a smaller diesel fleet.\n\nAdvertising profits rose 13.4 per cent to $20.8 million due to increased advertising on trains, buses and in the network, while rental profit was up 9.6 per cent at $73.4 million due to more lettable space after the redevelopment of Woodlands Xchange and higher rental renewal rates.\n\nTotal expenses rose 7.3 per cent to $1.12 billion on higher staff, depreciation and other expenses.\n\nFull-year earnings per share came to 4.1 cents, down 25.8 per cent from 5.5 cents the previous year.\n\nA final dividend of 1.2 cents per ordinary share has been proposed, up from one cent the previous year. Together with the interim dividend of one cent, the total dividend is 2.2 cents, down from the previous year's 2.5 cents.\n\nLooking ahead, SMRT said that its fare business will continue to be \"challenging\" because of heightened operating requirements, \"unless there are commensurate and timely fare adjustments\".\n\nThe company expects the impending changes to the rail financing and bus operating models to address the sustainability of its fare business.\n\nSMRT shares closed three cents lower at $1.22 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

All this betrays none of its past: The 125-year-old sandstone structure used to be a public toilet.\n\n\"It doesn't put me off, it just adds a bit of character to the place,\" Ben Andersen, 32, said over a cappuccino and apple crumble among the outdoor tables of the cafe, which was converted two years ago after three decades of disrepair. \"I'd never have guessed it used to be a toilet.\"\n\nFollowing a handful of such conversions over the past few decades, several more may be on the way. The City of Sydney this month adopted a Public Toilet Strategy that earmarked three more shuttered historic facilities. As spending at eateries grows at double the pace of all Australian retail sales amid worsening consumer confidence, the unused sandstone structures offer would-be restaurateurs prime locations with unique history.\n\nGardener's Lodge, built in the late 1880s as a residence for the University of Sydney's groundskeeper, was converted to toilets in 1911 and served the public until the mid-1980s when they were closed.\n\n\"These buildings are very sturdy and can put up with a lot of alteration, so there's no need to demolish them if you can use them for another purpose,\" said Murray Brown, Sydney-based adviser for the New South Wales chapter of the Australian Institute of Architects.\n\nThe three facilities the city is recommending for conversion are in prime locations: a toilet block built into cliffs on Hickson Road, a 10-minute walk from a A$6 billion project of office towers, luxury apartments and casino being developed by Lend Lease Group; decommissioned 1930s restrooms in Belmore Park near Central station; and an early 1900s public urinal-turned-electricity substation at Taylor Square on Oxford Street, along which the city's annual Mardi Gras parade travels.\n\n\"In the past, the City has called for expressions of interest to find the most appropriate use for similar, disused facilities,\" Matthew Moore, a spokesman for the City of Sydney said.\n\nThe council has received \"a number of enquiries to convert these old toilets into cafes, so there is clearly interest\". While the Toilet Strategy report estimates the conversion costs at A$850,000 (S$990,711), it hasn't earmarked city funds this time.\n\nThe city spent more than A$1.2 million to restore the Gardener's Lodge exterior, windows and doors, repair its roof, and outfit the interior, according to the websites of the cafe and Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore.\n\nIn October 2012, Wendy Johnsson and Aboriginal elder Beryl Van-Oploo opened the eatery at the site, near a former Aboriginal meeting place, with a goal of helping indigenous people's participation in employment.\n\n\"If you don't grab the opportunities with both hands, they won't happen,\" Ms Johnsson said. \"As much as it's a beautiful building, and I don't want to put a negative slant on it,\" she cited challenges due to the building's size requiring table space outdoors and its distance from other destinations.\n\nAustralia's vibrant coffee culture, along with the relative outperformance of convenient, affordable eateries compared with other retailers, is driving the growth of cafes, said Stephen Gargano, Melbourne-based analyst at industry research firm IBISWorld.\n\nWith the number of cafes and coffee shops in Australia forecast to climb to 9,783 by mid-2019 after increasing more than 20 per cent in the past five years to 8,570, according to IBISWorld, standing out as a historic toilet could be what keeps a cafe alive, said Craig Reid, a Sydney-based business consultant and author of The Complete Guide to Buying a Cafe.\n\n\"There's a high level of competitiveness in the industry,\" Mr Reid said. \"There might be an initial sense of revulsion, but if it's done the right way, people will soon stop thinking of them as toilets.\"\n\nIn Sydney's centre, overlooking Hyde Park and connected to St James railway station, another converted heritage-listed sandstone public toilet has housed French bistro Metro St James for the past year. The eastern part of the station, built in 1926, included toilets before being converted to cafe use in the 1990s, according to the City of Sydney's website.\n\nThe crumbling toilet blocks the city wants to repurpose could be as successful as his Sydney Cove Oyster Bar, said Philip Thompson, whose 678 sq ft waterfront eatery, overlooking the Sydney Harbour Bridge, was converted from public facilities in 1988.\n\n\"A lot of toilet blocks built in the early 1900s were designed beautifully,\" said Mr Thompson. \"If they can put a cafe in there, why wouldn't they? You're making use of the infrastructure that's already there, and it generates income for the city.\"\n\nWhile it's been profitable since its second year, Barry Manton, who holds 75 per cent of the Oyster Bar with Mr Thompson, said multiple agency approvals, construction delays, and costs three times higher than expected, at A$240,000, means he wouldn't do it again. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM\n\nUK homebuyer demand rebounds to a six-month high, index shows\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:30 AM", "images": []}

By Mireya Navarro and Vivian Yee\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Apr 30, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nNew York\n\nNUBIA Chavez and Manuel Acu\u00f1a have been bouncing from rental to rental around New York City like millennials. They recently decamped to a US$700-a-month room in a Queens apartment, with a shared bathroom and no access to the kitchen except to make coffee.\n\nBut Ms Chavez, a housekeeper, and Mr Acu\u00f1a, a retired building porter, are not in their 20s. They are 65 and 72, and they say they are tired - of the moving, of the lack of permanency and of a lifestyle not suited to their age.\n\n\"I want to live in my own place,\" Ms Chavez said. \"No more rooms.\"\n\nJennifer Stock, 33, has been looking for a place for her ailing 89-year-old father after his assisted living residence in Park Slope announced that it would shut down by this summer.\n\nAnd in Queens, Norma and Rodolfo de la Rosa recently put their names on a waiting list for an affordable residence for older adults because, they say, their Social Security cheques cannot keep up with rent increases. The list has nearly 4,000 names.\n\nFinding adequate housing has become an all-consuming preoccupation for many older New Yorkers, a group whose explosive growth and changing housing needs pose new challenges for the city. As serious as New York's affordable housing shortage has become, the squeeze has been perhaps harshest on older adults. At a certain age, substandard living conditions become less tolerable, walk-ups are no longer viable, even stabilised rents become too high, and the need for housing with special services grows.\n\nThe intensifying demand for housing for aging adults already overwhelms the existing offerings, especially for the poor, senior services providers say. And the city, they say, has no comprehensive housing plan to accommodate an aging population. \"When you put all this together, it begs the question: What are we going to do?\" said Bobbie Sackman, director of public policy with the Council of Senior Centers and Services of New York City. \"How are we going to age as a city?\"\n\nThe city's older population is now its fastest-growing. In about 15 years, by 2030, New York for the first time will have as many residents 65 and older as those of school age - 15.5 per cent of city residents, compared with 12 per cent now, city planners say. By then, the city will have 300,000 more older people than the one million it has today. By 2040, it will have over 400,000 more than it does today.\n\nThe older population is largely white, reflecting the aging of early immigrant groups such as the Italians and Irish, demographers say. But it will become increasingly diverse, they note.\n\n\"The increase in the older population is a major demographic change that's upon us and will continue to be upon us going forward,\" said Joseph Salvo, chief demographer at the Department of City Planning. The aging trend is nationwide as more baby boomers reach retirement age, but New York's older population has disproportionately high numbers of renters, people who live alone and who are poor. Almost a quarter of older adults in the city live in poverty.\n\nThe widening gap between rents and incomes is hitting those people hard, even those in rent-stabilised apartments. About 51 per cent of renter households led by an older New Yorker pay at least 35 per cent of their income in rent, or above what the federal government considers affordable, making residents 65 and older among the most rent-burdened in the city, census data show.\n\nBut housing for the aging has yet to become a priority.\n\nOf the 165,000 affordable housing units created or preserved under former mayor Michael Bloomberg, fewer than 10,000 units were set aside for older residents, the Council of Senior Centers and Services said in a recent report urging Mr Bloomberg's successor, Mayor Bill de Blasio, to increase those numbers.\n\nThe city comptroller's office found the city to be \"woefully behind other areas of the country in providing viable subsidised and market-rate options suitable for and affordable to seniors\" in its own report on housing affordability released last week.\n\n\"Absent a concerted effort, we'll see an explosion of elderly people in shelters,\" said the comptroller, Scott Stringer.\n\nThe de Blasio administration said that it recognised the issue and would address it in the mayor's housing plan, expected to be released soon. \"When you have a group on a fixed income, that's a great housing need because we know rents are going to go up and the income will not,\" said Jessica Katz, the assistant commissioner of special needs at the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development.\n\nLack of options\n\nWith their access to public transportation and healthcare, their wide entertainment offerings and community services, cities\n\nsuch as New York can be an ideal place to grow old. But with aging comes the need for not just adequate housing but also services that support waning abilities.\n\nToday, even older New Yorkers of means can have difficulty finding the right place to live.\n\nWhen the Prospect Park Residence, an assisted-living centre in Park Slope where monthly rates are about US$4,500 a month and up, announced in March that it would close, residents and their families were sent into a panicked race to secure a spot in similar places across the city. They soon found out that those spots were scarce and, even when available, too expensive or inadequate.\n\n\"There's this sort of hysteria about, there's only so many places for people to move,\" said Ms Stock, whose father, a retired vice-president at a telephone cable company, has Alzheimer's.\n\nNew York has fewer market-rate housing options for older people, such as assisted-living and retirement communities, than other major metropolitan areas, largely because it is an expensive place to put up buildings or rehabilitate older ones, senior housing industry specialists said. At lower incomes, the options narrow even for the healthy and able-bodied.\n\nWith Social Security and pension cheques of US$28,000 a year, a 71-year-old retired warehouse worker in Brooklyn has tried applying for subsidised housing for low-income older adults, he said, but he has been put on a waiting list that lasts years. One mixed-income building had 10,000 applicants for 100 units; he did not make the lottery.\n\nSo the man shuttles between two public housing projects. One is in Brooklyn, where he lived before he broke up with his partner, who now sometimes lets him stay a night or two on the couch. The other is his niece's apartment in Brooklyn, home to seven other people, where his bed is a brown sofa ottoman. Sometimes, when it gets too crowded, he camps out in his Toyota van.\n\nDoubling up\n\n\"You ever see the hogs in a farm?\" said the man, whose name is being withheld because revealing his identity could jeopardise his hosts' public housing leases.\n\nBut doubling up is not uncommon. Increasingly, older city residents share living quarters with other family members - 31.2 per cent live with two to four relatives, census data show, an increase from 21.3 per cent in 1980. As one's years advance, though, sleeping on a couch becomes less feasible, and some living quarters become less tolerable. Maria Peralta, 61, a retired sewing machine operator and office custodian who has lived in an illegally subdivided basement in Queens since her divorce 20 years ago, said that her asthma was getting worse in the stuffiness of her windowless room. \"Sometimes I can't breathe,\" Ms Peralta said.\n\nParvati Devi, 67, struggles to navigate three flights of stairs after 43 years in her two-room apartment. She has a torn meniscus in an arthritic left knee that requires her to use a walking stick. Ms Devi is applying to a senior residence in her neighbourhood, gathering doctors' notes in hopes of gaining preferential status. \"I just want to get out of there,\" she said.\n\nEven some older people in apartments suited to their needs are being forced to look for new housing. With rents rising steadily even in stabilised apartments, which have undergone increases of 2 per cent to 4.5 per cent each year in recent decades, the cost of housing is taking a bigger chunk of Social Security cheques, pensions and savings.\n\nMr de Blasio took office on a platform of creating more affordable housing. Advocates for older New Yorkers are urging him to incorporate senior units into his housing targets - for instance, setting aside for older residents 20 per cent of the 50,000 new units the mayor wants to create through new requirements on developers in exchange for density.

It definitely will have an impact on real estate.\"\n\nSince 2010, the authorities have implemented several measures to curb rising property prices, including an unprecedented bid to restrict the number of non-local homebuyers with a 15 per cent property tax on foreign investors.\n\nMr Rhee said the Hong Kong government can consider weakening some of the measures when prices start to fall in a more significant manner in order to achieve a \"soft landing\".\n\nThe recommendations came as the IMF expected the city's gross domestic product to grow by 3.7 per cent this year, before edging up to 3.8 per cent next year.\n\nIn general, the IMF projects Asia's growth to remain steady at 5.4 per cent this year, compared to 5.2 per cent last year.\n\nIt can further improve to 5.5 per cent in the next year, driven by demand, the IMF said. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/bc6c4dfa4223e7aca7eba55811d6265d6426a7976e9cc3af8c4706639dab9bfb?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Pricey homes: Hong Kong's housing market has become one of the most expensive in the world due to an influx of capital from China and record low interest rates. -\u00a0THE STRAITS TIMES FILE PHOTO"}]}

Domestic vulnerabilities could magnify some of these risks.\"\n\nFor the bulk of Asia, however, \"financial stability risks appear contained and bank balance sheets have scope to absorb negative shocks\", so systemic risk is unlikely.\n\n\"However, as global interest rates and term premiums move higher, vulnerabilities stemming from pockets of high corporate and household leverage could become more salient.\n\n\"If economic conditions become less hospitable, corporate defaults may occur and investment by highly leveraged firms could take a hit.\"\n\nGrowing regional integration is propelling Asia's growth, but it could also amplify the impact of global and regional shocks, the IMF suggested. Events in the past year have been a reminder of Asia's exposure to policy decisions in advanced economies; trade and financial channels are a growing source of interconnectedness.\n\nIntra-regional business cycle synchronisation has grown, and Asia is twice as exposed as other regions to growth shocks originating from China. Policymakers in Asia have taken policy actions to address vulnerabilities and those actions are starting to bear fruit, the IMF said.\n\n\"As an indicator of this improving resilience, India, Indonesia and other Asian emerging markets were able to better weather the bout of global financial volatility in January.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Before the current streak, Singapore last held the top spot in May 2012 before yielding to traditional rival London, which finally slipped from the peak in February.\n\nLondon and Singapore have traditionally been major markets for offshore renminbi transactions outside of China and Hong Kong, given their status as currency hubs.

About 2,900 workers were made redundant in the first quarter - fewer than the 3,660 people affected in the fourth quarter of last year, but more than the 2,120 laid off in the first quarter of 2013.\n\nLayoffs declined from the preceding quarter in services and manufacturing, but went up in construction.\n\nStill, services accounted for a slight majority of the workers laid off (52 per cent, or 1,500), with the remainder of those affected spread between manufacturing (28 per cent, or 800) and construction (20 per cent, or 600).\n\nTotal employment growth fell to 24,900, lower than the seasonally high increase of 40,600 in the fourth quarter of 2013 and down from the 28,900 in the first quarter of last year.\n\nServices (21,900) continued to generate the bulk of employment gains, comparable with the first quarter of 2013 (21,100).\n\nThe manufacturing sector did not fare as well as it shed some 1,200 workers, on a par with the reduction a year ago. Construction workforce growth slowed to 4,000, from 8,400 in the previous quarter.\n\nOverall, there were over 3.5 million people in employment in March 2014 - 3.9 per cent higher than a year ago. This rate of increase, however, was lower than the 4.1 per cent in December last year.\n\nCommenting on the MOM report, Citigroup economist Kit Wei Zheng said that despite the uptick in the jobless rate, the labour market remained tight and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) was \"unlikely to be swayed\" into easing things just yet.\n\n\"We expect the labour market to remain consistently tight, in line with MAS's view that there will likely be no let-up in wage pressures, especially as economic conditions improve.\"\n\nAlison Baird, managing director (Asia-Pacific) of management services firm Alexander Mann Solutions, noted that many organisations in the region were busy investing in sourcing and securing talent. These companies are increasingly looking for ways to do this effectively and competitively, rather than waiting for the talent to come to them, she said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Of the other 38 companies, 30 explicitly chose not to limit the number of boards a director may sit on.\n\nMost of those companies said a blanket limit would not be as effective as individual assessments.\n\nAnd some observers appeared to agree.\n\n\"There is essentially nothing stopping someone who, for example, holds more than 10 directorships, if he or she continues to be effective,\" said Irving Low, KPMG's local head of risk consulting.\n\nBut Associate Professor Mak Yuen Teen of the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School believes limits are important in Singapore's context.\n\n\"In countries where directors face higher legal risk of being sued or charged, you find that directors generally don't serve on too many (boards),\" he said. \"Here, we seldom have directors taken to task, so there is not the same discipline.\"\n\nRemuneration disclosure was another issue with significant non-compliance. Under the revised Code, remuneration of chief executives and directors should be disclosed by name to the nearest $1,000, instead of the old $250,000 bands.\n\nAbout 64 per cent of the surveyed Mainboard companies and only 24 per cent of surveyed Catalist companies followed this disclosure recommendation. Those that did not comply mostly cited confidentiality and competition for talent.\n\nBut some commentators were sceptical.\n\n\"Those who want to poach your staff will have ways to find out how much they are paid. That's how headhunting works,\" Prof Mak noted.\n\nProf Mak ventured that some of the companies were actually avoiding having to justify their directors' paychecks. \"(Perhaps) they do not have an objective and fair performance management system (and) so are worried that disclosures may lead to questions of unfairness in pay within the company,\" he said.\n\nThe tenure of IDs was an area where companies appeared to take whatever slack the Code afforded.\n\nThe guidelines recommend that boards rigorously review the independence of IDs tenured for longer than nine years, and to explain if the directors are still independent.\n\nExcluding companies that have not been listed for more than nine years, more than three-quarters, or 13 out of 18, of Mainboard companies had IDs with tenures longer than nine years. Only one out of eight Catalist companies had IDs in such a situation. But all of those companies gave only brief, general explanations for why those IDs remained independent.\n\nDifficulty in finding replacements may explain the long tenures,said Ng Siew Quan, PwC internal audit and corporate governance lead. \"Whilst there are many competent potential directors and many potential willing directors, there is no abundance of competent and willing directors,\"\n\nCompared to the other key recommendations, the Code's call for at least a third of the board to be independent was an area where most companies were clearly in compliance.\n\nNearly all surveyed Catalist companies complied with this recommendation, while 70 per cent of surveyed Mainboard companies did the same. The one caveat to this result, however, is that independence is defined by the company.\n\nAssociate Professor Lawrence Loh of the NUS Business School reckoned that \"the symbolism\" of an explicit role can usefully shape how directors perceive their duties.\n\nSingapore has adopted a \"comply or explain\" regime in its Code, and the mixed level of compliance raises questions about the Code's effectiveness and relevance.\n\nObservers were split.\n\n\"The Code was meant to be aspirational in nature,\" said Adrian Chan, vice- chairman of the Singapore Institute of Directors.\n\nBut Ernst and Young advisory partner Neo Sing Hwee believes more can be done. \"Unless the Code is made mandatory instead of a set of recommended guidelines, we will continue to see varying degrees of compliance and adoption of the Code,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Seoul-based service has seen exponential growth in its user base since its launch in 2011, with 400 million registered Line users worldwide at last count.\n\nTellingly, however, Line does not release monthly active user (MAU) figures which are a better reflection of actual usage. In comparison, rivals WeChat and WhatsApp have more than 355 million and 400 million MAUs, respectively.\n\nEven so, Line is aware that chatting and social activity tend to be fragmented among several apps, and merely making it onto a user's smartphone is not enough. Now, it is moving past bodycount and going after actual activity on its platform.\n\n\"This year, my goal is to make Line users use Line every day. We want to make Line the main messenger for the smartphone user in Singapore,\" Mr Cho said, speaking on the sidelines of the opening of Line's pop-up store at Wisma Atria yesterday.\n\nWhile he would not reveal the size of Line's user base in Singapore, his goal for the market a year ago had been for the app to hit three million downloads locally. This pales in comparison to Indonesia's 20 million registered users and Malaysia's 10 million.\n\nEven so, Singaporeans' deeper pockets offer an average revenue per user that is higher than that of the other two markets, with users spending more on in-game purchases and virtual stickers, Mr Cho said.\n\nLast year, global revenue from the app stood at 34.3 billion yen (S$420.3 million), of which roughly 60 per cent came from in-game purchases while another 20 per cent came from stickers.\n\nAs Line jostles for space in Singapore's crowded messaging market, it is counting on what it calls its \"localisation\" strategy which relies on tie-ups with local firms that have existing relationships with consumers.\n\nMore of these tie-ups are set to happen this year, especially since Line's prepaid plan partnership with StarHub which was launched in February is no longer an exclusive one, according to Mr Cho. Line is now in talks with the other operators for similar tie-ups.\n\n\"We are looking into other opportunities with the other carriers. They're focusing on how to increase data revenue from their subscribers, so we believe that this kind of collaboration can increase the number of data users,\" Mr Cho said. No details were forthcoming, but new developments can be expected \"pretty soon\", he said.\n\nElsewhere, Line's localisation strategy appears to have worked. In Thailand, Line ran a consumer flash sale and offered stickers customised for the Thai market last year. Now, Thailand is Line's second-largest market with 24 million registered users as at March. Japan remains the app's stronghold, with 50 million users.\n\nAs part of its localisation effort here, Line's mascots - Cony the rabbit and Brown the bear - will have to put in some face-time. Today, they will make appearances at Uniqlo's Jem and Bugis+ outlets to take photos with fans, in a collaboration with the clothing retailer.\n\nLine's own pop-up store which opened yesterday also sells the plush-toy versions of Cony, Brown and their various furry friends.\n\nThe store might be open until May 22, but what it will signal to the market, Line hopes, is that the app is here to stay.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Hopes that a peace deal in Geneva meant peace in Eastern Ukraine were dashed by fatal clashes throughout last week. At the weekend, the Group of Seven (G-7) nations agreed to impose new economic sanctions on Russia.\n\nThe Russian stock and bond market have already sold off on fears of economic attrition. But tit-for-tat sanctions would also hurt businesses in the European Union. Last Friday, shares of credit-card processor Visa (which garners a substantial portion of its revenue from Europe) dropped precipitously in the wake of its earnings report. German utilities and retailers will also feel the pinch if, as some analysts predict, Russia counters Western sanctions by jacking up the price of the natural gas it sells to many European nations.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Indeed, there is much consternation among some older supporters of Prime Minister Tony Abbott's coalition that they have elected politicians who would require them to work until they are 70 before becoming eligible for an old-age pension.\n\nBut Canberra argues that the financial outlook is dire: the latest forecast is for a budget deficit of A$34 billion (S$39.7 billion) next financial year, followed by deficits of A$24 billion and A$18 billion in the following years. Australians are being warned that only by getting back to surplus can the country stop borrowing - which this year alone means an interest bill of A$12 billion or about the same as the country spends on higher education.\n\nThus, not only are workers who are nearing the current retirement age of 65 being warned that they might have to work longer before they qualify for the pension, other entitlements are being targeted as well. Australia's expenditure on Medicare, the universal health scheme, is seen to be growing at an unsustainable rate. The plan seems to be to cut demand for Medicare-funded services by making patients pay a certain amount for each consultation. Other proposed cuts seem to include industry assistance and funding for hospitals. The government argues that the volume of demand for these programmes is outstripping the capacity of taxpayers to fund them.\n\nHowever, there seems to be disjuncture between the rhetoric of Australian ministers on the need to cut spending and projected expenditures on Mr Abbott's own promises to the electorate before the last election - and one which will cost the government substantial amounts. Touted as a growth measure, Mr Abbott's most expensive pledge is to introduce a paid parental leave scheme estimated to cost A$5.5 billion annually. The scheme would give parents - earning up to A$150,000 a year - their full salary for up to six months after each child is born. Equally, the decision to buy some 58 US-made F-35 fighters, still in development, at a currently estimated cost of A$12 billion has led to an outcry on priorities - that pensioners are being asked to tighten their belts so that the money can be spent on weapons.\n\nOn the revenue side, the carbon tax as well as the mining tax, introduced by the previous Australian Labour Party government, is set to be abolished. Mr Abbott says that the carbon tax is a drag on economic growth and the mining tax has not collected much by way of revenue. Yet, despite earlier tough words about profit-shifting MNCs that avoid paying their fair share of local taxes, nothing seems to be brewing on this front. If every cent of expenditure counts, equally every cent of revenue should matter. Mr Abbott would do well to look at both the expenditure as well as the revenue sides of the ledger if he wants to balance his Budget.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

On Friday, the company completed the sale of its beleaguered handset business to Microsoft for US$7.5 billion.\n\nThe deal's closing puts a spotlight on what remains of Nokia, which includes the Finnish company's mobile networking business and a research and intellectual property unit. But it is Nokia's efforts to map the entire world digitally that could prove to be the company's hidden gem - or at least emerge as a compelling, multibillion-dollar takeover target.\n\nNokia's goal with its mapping system, known as Here and developed in Berlin, is simple but ambitious: to build the world's most detailed and up-to-date digital maps.\n\nIn smartphones, Here is outgunned by Google Maps, which has an estimated 1 billion mobile users and is aided by being standard issue on phones using Google's Android operating system. Here, which is the default mapping application on Windows phones, has only about 100 million smartphone users.\n\nIn automobile mapping, however, Here dominates, with more than 80 per cent of the global market for built-in car navigation systems - a field in which Google and Apple are scrambling to catch up.\n\nNokia contends that its mapping products, which are updated 2.7 million times a day, are more accurate than its rivals' offerings and that its ability to customise maps for different customers sets it apart.\n\nGoogle, for its part, counters that it makes tens of thousands of changes to its maps daily and that it uses complex algorithms and external information from the likes of the US Census Bureau to build maps for 198 countries.\n\nWhile rivals like Apple have tried to break into the global mapping business, they have so far been largely unsuccessful, leaving Nokia's 29-year-old Here mapping system as the only contender for companies and consumers looking for an alternative to Google.\n\n\"Mapping is an expensive business,\" said Annette Zimmermann, an analyst at technology research company Gartner in Munich. \"If you haven't already built what these guys have built, it doesn't make sense to start now.\"\n\nDespite the strong position, though, Nokia's mapping unit last year generated only 7 per cent, or US$1.2 billion, of the company's total revenue, excluding its handset unit, according to corporate filings. The division also reported an operating loss of US$212 million over the same period, as the company continued to invest in the mapping operation, which has 6,000 employees, or around 11 per cent of Nokia's remaining workforce of 55,000.\n\nThe weak financial figures have led many analysts to question whether the company has the deep pockets required to keep pace in mapping. Besides its auto clients, Nokia licenses Here to companies including Microsoft, for its Bing search engine; to Amazon, for the Kindle Fire tablet; and to Yahoo for its Flickr photo service. FedEx uses Here mapping data to manage its delivery trucks worldwide. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

It has to be one that tackles Pteris's deep-seated problems.\n\nFor one thing, the RTO certainly looks like it will plug the airport logistics systems provider's pressing cash shortage. It will merge Pteris's balance sheet with that of target Tianda Airport Support, a passenger boarding bridge-manufacturer that Pteris's board says has posted continuous, increasing profits since 2000.\n\nTianda's parent, container giant China International Marine Containers (CIMC) Group, will also hold more than 75 per cent of Pteris shares after the deal, compared to its current 14.99 per cent stake; the increased commitment may allow Pteris to lean on CIMC, with its US$8.9 billion turnover in 2012, for financing.\n\nBut Pteris's cash problems are also symptomatic of a lack of competitiveness and profitability.\n\nFirstly, the technology supporting the product Pteris offers has started to lag behind the competition, and the firm needs to innovate. Pteris could not bid for two recent tenders because it did not have a new system that clients wanted.\n\nSecondly, its projects are costly and overly long. Pteris has acknowledged this by undertaking Project 20/20, and the time and cost-cutting exercise has produced some cost-saving technology. But it has not solved the significant project management woes which the board identified as a major contributor to Pteris's $29.7 million losses last year.\n\nOutstanding claims\n\nWhen a project is delayed because of the client or unforeseen circumstances, compensation for the expenses incurred - such as to keep Pteris personnel in a foreign country - cannot be claimed until project completion. Likewise for costs arising from changes that clients insist on mid-way through a project.\n\nThese challenges can be worse in some markets than others. For example, it has found it difficult to claim fair compensation on its projects in India and the Middle East, where projects have been delayed up to four years.\n\nSuch outstanding claims are why materials, subcontract and other direct costs come up to 99.8 per cent of Pteris's $50.4 million FY13 revenue.\n\nIt is not a convincing argument, at this point, that the RTO will tackle these problems. While Pteris can make use of CIMC's strengths in global marketing, procurement and shared services to cut costs, it is unclear that the RTO will drive product innovation as hoped.\n\nCIMC wants to take Pteris under its wing precisely because Pteris offers a part that is lacking in CIMC's spectrum of transportation equipment services; will CIMC have the expertise to innovate where a specialist like Pteris cannot?\n\nThe board also emphasised that CIMC will open the burgeoning Chinese market for Pteris. But nothing suggests that it will be easier to get compensation from Chinese clients than Pteris's existing clients in the event of project changes or delays.\n\nForex issues\n\nSome of Pteris's contracts were inked in foreign currency that depreciated over the course of lengthy projects. This was partly responsible for Pteris's losses, according to the board.\n\nAgain, it is hard to see how the Chinese market will be any different from Pteris's existing markets in terms of foreign exchange risks. The yuan's currency band has widened and its previously steady appreciation has apparently ended. If anything, the potential for underestimating currency fluctuations in Chinese contracts looms larger than before.\n\nUntil Pteris evolves to a stage where it can adequately manage its projects and contracts, entering Chinese markets will simply be deja vu - different territory, same woes. Shareholders should therefore expect the board to deliver concrete evidence of this evolution and how partnering CIMC will drive innovation in time for the RTO extraordinary general meeting in the third quarter.\n\nWithout these assurances, shareholders are unlikely to buckle up and hope that the present turbulence is only temporary - they will instead start eyeing the nearest exits.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Two brokerage houses, AmFraser and DMG & Partners, initiated \"buy\" calls in quick succession. The riot highlighted a shortage of liveable spaces for workers such as dormitories - a gap that Centurion fills, analysts noted.\n\nNow, the company's stock is flying high at over 70 cents a share last week - more than two-and-a- half times the 27 cents it traded at a year ago. Construction group and joint-venture partner Lian Beng also bought a 5 per cent stake in the company in March.\n\nThe key draw of the stock is how it gives exposure to cashflow- generating property assets in the undersupplied segment of foreign worker dorms, where the rent per bed has been increasing 20 per cent a year and Centurion's Singapore occupancy rates are almost full.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Jaime Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 25, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT must be nice being at the top of the Restaurant Guide's World's 50 Best list. Everybody wants to be your friend, nobody gets angry about waiting a year for a reservation, and major distillers like The Macallan knock on your door, saying, \"Hello, would you like to visit our cellars and taste our special one-cask whiskies that no mere mortal gets to try?\"\n\nThe Roca brothers certainly aren't complaining.\n\nIt's a cool, sunny April morning in Girona, Spain. Their restaurant - the three Michelin-starred El Celler de Can Roca - sits in perpetual picture-postcard perfection with its charming country house facade hiding a state-of-the-art kitchen and cellar within its sleek interior. Today, 60 journalists from around the world mill around, sipping on whisky cocktails as they await news of one of the most unique culinary tie-ups of the year: six ultimate dinners featuring the Rocas's innovative Catalan cuisine and the best of Macallan's iconic single malts.\n\nIf you're a haute diner with a charitable heart and US$10,000 to spare, you'll want to clear your diary for the months of June and July. That's when The Macallan Masters of Taste sees roughly 150 people sampling the results of a collaboration designed to test the depth of the Roca brothers' skills. Net profits from the dinners will go to charity, in line with The Macallan's philanthropic ethos. The company is owned by the Robertson Trust, a Scottish foundation which gives out some US$25 million a year to deserving causes.\n\nThis marriage of gastronomy and premium spirits is firing up the creativity of two top guns in the food and beverage industry. The affinity between food and wine has long been established, but food and whisky? It's rare for such a pairing to be explored, especially at such a high level, but the Rocas are quick to take up the gauntlet.\n\n\"We've always been non-conformists and we're constantly seeking new challenges,\" says oldest brother Joan Roca, who masterminds the restaurant's creative direction with master sommelier Josep and pastry whiz Jordi. Thanks to their new visibility as World's No 1, \"We get a lot of proposals for different things, so we have to be selective. But the collaboration with The Macallan is a springboard into a new world that will allow us to grow professionally and personally.\"\n\nFor Josep Roca, whose own meticulously laid out cellar is both a treasure trove of wine gems and a lesson in Spanish oenology, he is literally a kid in a candy shop. \"For a sommelier, you can't imagine the joy of having a distillery open for you to play in,\" he enthuses. He was given full rein of The Macallan's cellars, sampling never-released single cask whiskies with acclaimed whisky maker Bob Dalgarno to pick out the flavours and aromas that he and his brothers would later translate into a no-holds-barred dining experience.\n\n\"The challenge for us is to take the best of the world's whisky with our cuisine and create a bond,\" says Joan. \"One of the key elements is aroma, and using them to create a new way of cooking, which has not been done before.\"\n\n\"Whisky is different from wine in that you don't need to drink so much because of the alcohol content,\" concurs Josep. \"It's about taking these aromas and using them to make food.\"\n\nHeady mix\n\nIt's a concept they're not unfamiliar with, especially for Jordi, who has created desserts inspired by perfumes, such as the bergamot notes of Calvin Klein's Eternity. He's even created his own perfume, which makes women smell like his lemon cloud dessert. With Jordi's nose for scents and sweets, Josep's passion for sherry - hence his enthusiasm for The Macallan's whisky aged in prized sherry casks - and Joan's wizardry in the hot kitchen, there's going to be some major culinary alchemy brewing come June.\n\nThe El Celler connection is the latest in a very short exclusive list of high-profile collaborations that The Macallan has undertaken with big names in the creative world. Previously, it worked with top photographers such as Annie Leibovitz in its Masters of Photography franchise, and it has had a long-standing relationship with crystal maker Lalique, which has crafted bottles for The Macallan's ultra high-end whiskies.\n\n\"Whisky and cuisine have a long-standing connection but never have any two partners come together to really explore what this could mean,\" says Ken Grier, The Macallan's director of malts, explaining why they approached El Celler with their proposal. \"Our collaboration will break down classic perceptions of food pairing and enter a whole new experience of taste.\"\n\nFor whisky maker Bob Dalgarno, who worked with Josep Roca in The Macallan's cellars, it was a win-win situation for both. \"We're all creative people coming together with an open mind about what we were looking for. A lot of things are similar (between food and whisky) - it's about flavour and how it stands on its own, depth, complexities and so on. We learnt a lot from them and I hope they picked up bits and pieces from us too.\"\n\nThe proof of the pudding is, of course, in the tasting and the brothers roll out an impressive preview of what's to come in June, with an elaborate showcase menu that require both nose and palate to work together for the complete experience. To start, a good whiff of the vanilla notes in The Macallan 2007 (sherry cask) continues in the corn and vanilla wonton ravioli - a slinky gelatine skin filled with creamy corn, lightly slicked with olive oil that complements the whisky.\n\nFresh langoustine is \"steamed\" in whisky fumes over a bowl of hot stones, while the accompanying soup made from its head with hazelnuts, follows the same nutty aroma of The Macallan 1986 it's matched with. Meanwhile, The Macallan 1998 picks up the spicy citrus tones of the barely cooked turbot with its rainbow of sauces from olive oil to orange and curry.\n\nAnd so it continues: the smokiness of The Macallan 1986 (sherry cask) lingering over the charcoal-grilled Iberian suckling pig with its smoked bacon and hazelnut sauce; fragrant vanilla and bergamot aromas of the bourbon cask 2007 lifting a slightly sweet brioche filled with smooth mushroom cream; intensely flavoured goose royale with mixed nuts and the fragrance of sandalwood make for a complex accompaniment to the iconic Macallan M; boozy sheep's milk cream with a thick toffee sauce, vaguely bitter truffle and liquorice granita.\n\nIt's an exercise in nuance, complexity and colour as the spectrum of scents, flavours and everything in between are juggled between both liquid and solid nourishment. If this was just a preview, imagine what the real thing will be when the heavy artillery of 14 un-released single cask malts and The M - the world's most expensive whisky - are rolled out with a menu that continues to be refined up to the big days.\n\nOf course, US$10,000 is a pretty penny to pay for the whole affair. But considering that you're cutting El Celler's one year reservation queue and getting a customised meal with one-of-a-kind whiskies - not to mention doing your bit for charity - it's a reasonable premium for Macallan fans to call themselves a Master of Taste.

A US Navy submersible drone scanned a remote patch of the Indian Ocean seabed yesterday in its so far fruitless efforts to find signs of the missing plane, but bad weather prevented an air and sea surface search.\n\nMore than seven weeks after the jet carrying 239 people disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, and six weeks since the search moved from Asia to the Indian Ocean, authorities are now regrouping to decide how to proceed.\n\n\"We are currently consulting very closely with our international partners on the best way to continue the search into the future,\" the Joint Agency Coordination Centre in charge of the search told Reuters.\n\nMalaysia, China, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Britain and the US are assisting Australia in trying to solve the most expensive search in aviation history.\n\n\"Obviously we don't know all the details but we do know if in fact the plane went down in the ocean on this part of this world, there is a big place and it is very challenging and laborious effort,\" Mr Obama said. \"It is going to take quite some time.\"\n\nA US defence official told Reuters on Friday that the sea search is likely to drag on for years as it enters the much more difficult phase of scouring broader areas of the ocean near where the plane is believed to have crashed.\n\nAustralia and Malaysia are under pressure to bring closure to the grieving families of those on board MH370, which disappeared on March 8, by finding wreckage to determine what happened to the aircraft.\n\nMalaysia is also under growing pressure to improve its disclosure about its investigation, although Mr Obama said yesterday that US authorities had found it to be \"fully forthcoming\" in sharing information.\n\nMr Najib has said his government would make public a preliminary report into the plane's disappearance this week.\n\nMalaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters the previous week that authorities would be \"increasing the assets that are available for deep-sea search\" and that his government was seeking help from state oil company Petronas which has expertise in deep-sea exploration.\n\nThe empty expanse of water some 1,000 miles northwest of Western Australia's state capital Perth is one of the most remote places in the world and also one of the deepest.\n\nUntil now, the undersea search has been focused on a 10 square km circular zone where a series of \"pings\" detected earlier this month led authorities to believe the plane's black box flight recorders may be located.\n\nThe undersea search is set to be extended beyond this small area if the US Bluefin-21 drone fails to find anything, the search authority said on Saturday. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

There are less than six months to go before Singapore stages its biggest professional tennis event in history, and the 41-year-old Scot is determined to make sure that word of the event - the BNP Paribas Women's Tennis Association (WTA) Championships - gets out to the masses.\n\nMr Sandilands is the new chief executive officer for the WTA's operations in the Asia-Pacific region, having packed his bags and moved his family from Beijing - where he was the managing director of sports marketing agency Octagon - to Singapore last December. He says that his new team at the WTA is pulling out all the stops to make the first edition of the US$6.5 million Championships nothing short of a \"knock-out success\".\n\nThe world's top eight singles players and doubles teams will be jetting in for the season-ending event, set to take place at the Singapore Sports Hub from Oct 17-26. The exact line-up of players will only be confirmed a month or so before that, but could well include the likes of Li Na, Serena Williams, Agnieszka Radwanska and even Martina Hingis, the former world number one who is back on tour after her retirement U-turn.\n\nBT Weekend spoke to Mr Sandilands earlier this week to find out more about his big push to make women's tennis even bigger in Asia than it already is today.\n\nTell me more about your job and what a typical day is like for you\n\nThe only thing that's typical about my day is that it starts early and finishes late (laughs). That happens whenever you're running the Asia-Pacific region but you report to a head office in the US (the WTA headquarters is in Florida). That means you wake up to overnight e-mails and you end your day with phone calls to the US.\n\nIn between, I have responsibilities in several areas. The first is to grow the WTA brand in the region, to help spread the message about the WTA, who we are and what we stand for. We have over 40 years of history, a very strong and compelling story based on the principles of the empowerment of women, equality, accessibility, fun, and a health and fitness message. We want to engage with as many people as possible, get them to buy into this and support us, whether it's by going to our live events, or by using our digital and social platforms, or simply just picking up a racket and going out to play the game.\n\nWhat do you make of the level of interest of tennis in Singapore?\n\nWhenever I meet people and mention that I work for the WTA, many are aware of the Championships taking place this October. They inevitably talk about how they got started playing the sport, and how they would like to play more. Part of our remit is to encourage more people to play tennis and become fans of women's tennis.\n\nWe're working with our corporate partners of the event. (Local luxury property developer and the event's presenting sponsor) SC Global Developments, for instance, is investing in a programme to get more tennis into Singapore schools. Whatever the level of tennis is in any country, we always feel that it can be improved.\n\nWe should all pool our resources and get kids playing at a younger age. We give them a chance to be active, fit and healthy. It also helps with their self-confidence. With the right coaching and guidance, and the effort put in by the individual, we can unearth some talent and maybe we can groom a future champion.\n\nTickets have just gone on sale for the Championships. This is the first time many Singaporeans will be watching world-class competitive tennis. What can we expect?\n\nEvery player who turns up in Singapore is a world star. They are the top eight women in tennis. Every match is a potential Grand Slam final. Everyone who buys a ticket knows that they will see great players who are competing hard for something. There is big prize money at stake, but there's also the potential to be the end-of-year champion. As for tickets, we've staggered the pricing to make sure it's accessible. Depending if you want the cheapest tickets, or if you're hosting corporates, or you want the higher-end seats with hospitality thrown in, these options are available as well. Anyone who wants to experience the event will have the chance to do so.\n\nHow do you plan to reach out to the non-tennis fans?\n\nFor the ardent fans, they already know that this is the crown jewel of the women's tour. For those who are less familiar, we can start that process of educating. That starts with people like (former world\n\nNo 1) Chris Evert and Eugenie Bouchard coming to Singapore and talking about what this event means to them.\n\nChris won 91 per cent of her matches during her career, and she's said that the Championships was one of the most important tournaments to compete in. Then you have Eugenie, a young girl from Canada aspiring to get to Singapore. Over the next few months, we will continue to tell more stories so that more people will understand why this will be a great experience that they should be part of.\n\nDoes your family enjoy the sport?\n\nWe all play. But even if you aggregate our skills together, we're still not very good (laughs). I would say we've got a lot of passion and enthusiasm for the game. My five-year-old son loves getting out on the court and just hitting the ball. My daughter, who's eight, is a bit more competitive. She gets a bit frustrated when she doesn't play as well. As for my wife, she finds tennis a great way of keeping fit. We've made many good friends along the way too. Tennis allows the whole family to spend some time together.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

M&M maker Mars and Colgate-Palmolive late last month announced their plans to use only certified palm oil by the end of next year; Procter & Gamble, which was recently the target of a global Greenpeace campaign, committed on April 8 to ensuring no deforestation in its palm oil supply chain.\n\nEurope, the third-largest import market for palm oil after India and China, has led the demand for sustainability in the palm oil sector. In France, food companies have started using \"palm oil-free\" labels as a badge of honour.\n\nConcern is growing that the palm oil industry will suffer if it remains deaf to these demands from its customers.\n\nSaid Wilmar CEO Kuok Khoon Hong at its results briefing in February: \"If this clash continues, maybe the EU governments will stop using palm oil for biofuels under pressure from all their consumers. You can see some very big companies already saying that they don't use palm oil. It's a selling point (for them).\"\n\n\"If they stop using palm oil for biofuel, if all the big consumers there stop using palm oil, crude palm oil (price) may drop by US$200-300 a tonne. What's the point of planting another 15,000 hectares (then)?\" he asked.\n\nWilmar has therefore decided to take the lead in the industry. \"We're hoping for other companies, other plantations to join us, to try to make the whole industry sustainable.\"\n\nBut these changes will not come without cost, say analysts.\n\nWhile the impact on the profitability of palm oil firms would not be significant in the short term, \"(it) could slow down their ability to grow due to the more stringent policies that they have adopted\", said CIMB analyst Ivy Ng.\n\nA Wilmar spokeswoman conceded that its business will be affected in the short term. \"We recognise that this is something we have to do, both for the business and the environment. We believe the long-term benefits will outweigh the challenges facing us in the short term,\" she said.\n\nCommitting to sustainability, however, is only a first step, said Greenpeace head of forest campaign Bustar Maitar. \"The next step - and a big one - after that is to actually implement the policy itself.\"\n\nThis will be important in gaining the trust of the market, said Scott Poynton, executive director of Forest Trust, a Swiss non-profit organisation. \"There's still a lot of cynicism and mistrust about these companies. If they can prove that they are not just greenwashing, they will start winning confidence back from the broad market and the NGO community.\"\n\nChallenges abound for palm oil firms. For one thing, the definitions of peat land and high carbon forest are hazy. Standards are also always moving higher.\n\nIn view of this, Carey Wong, an analyst at OCBC, says a continual raising of the bar may bode well for the industry ultimately.\n\n\"We believe it is a good thing - it raises the standard for the whole industry and makes them appear on a par with practices in the Western world,\" he said.\n\nCustomers who are more discerning are also willing to pay more, he added. \"So that could still be a 'win-win' for the companies that are RSPO-certified, for example.\" RSPO, or the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, is an industry body that promotes the use of sustainable palm oil products.\n\nAnd there may be no two ways about it - those who refuse to adapt will be left behind. Said Mr Poynton: \"In time, the buyers will desert them. The change is coming. Their resistance will ultimately be undermined.\"\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Indirect taxes are not directly imposed on income, but on the consumption of goods and services.\n\n\"The increases in indirect tax rates globally are arguably evidence of it becoming the choice tax for governments around the world seeking to raise much-needed income,\" said KPMG.\n\nAt 7 per cent, Singapore's indirect taxes are the second-lowest in Asia, behind Taiwan (5 per cent).\n\nOf more than 130 countries and markets studied by KPMG, Singapore - along with Panama and Thailand - has the fourth-lowest indirect tax rate.\n\nSaid Tay Hong Beng, head of Tax, KPMG in Singapore: \"Indirect tax and its application changes almost daily in any number of countries. This variety comes with numerous complexities.\n\n\"Businesses must recognise that indirect taxes are here to stay, and should think carefully about where they put their tax time, effort and dollars. They must also ensure that they embrace technology so that their accounting and reporting systems can handle the increasing complexities of indirect tax.\"\n\nAs for corporate taxes, at 17 per cent, Singapore's corporate tax rate continues to be the lowest in Asean.\n\nOf the economies KPMG studied, the United Arab Emirates has the highest corporate tax rate (55 per cent), while Montenegro has the lowest (9 per cent).\n\nSingapore, Slovenia, and Taiwan have the ninth-lowest corporate tax rates. Regional rival Hong Kong, at 16.5 per cent, is ranked just above Singapore in eighth place.\n\nMr Tay said Singapore's 17 per cent corporate tax rate was \"still competitive\" in the region: \"In fact, if we were to take into consideration the tax incentives that are offered to targeted industries and activities, the effective tax rates could possibly be much lower.\n\n\"With the establishment of the AEC (Asean Economic Community) on the horizon, it is important that Singapore remains relevant not only on corporate tax rates, but also in terms of tax administration and business regulations. Doing so will attract and facilitate the entry of international businesses into Singapore and the region.\"\n\nSeparately, the issue of tax transparency and morality - or whether companies are paying their \"fair share\" of corporate tax - remains one of the most prominent areas scrutinised by governments, the public as well as investors globally.\n\nKPMG said these issues were the drivers behind corporate tax fluctuations over the past 15 months, where some 24 countries lowered corporate tax rates and nine others raised them.\n\nAnd with a greater spotlight on tax transparency and morality, Mr Tay thinks corporate tax rates \"look set to go on a roller- coaster ride\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The areas of focus include payment of CPF contributions, timely salary and overtime payment, provision of paid annual and sick leave.\n\nThe CPF Board said that it had recovered $16.6 million in cases of underpayment or non-payment from 3,900 errant employers in industries such as security, cleaning and food & beverage. This benefited more than 19,000 employees.\n\nAn average of 3,600 bosses were late every month in making payments to the CPF. The CPF Board said that the timely detection and follow-up enforcement actions helped more than 230,000 workers and recovered $406.6 million.\n\n\"All employees who are Singapore citizens or permanent residents are entitled to CPF contributions from their employers, even if they work on a part-time basis,\" said Ng Hock Keong, director of the enforcement division at the CPF Board.\n\nThere were 41 convictions for non-payment and underpayment of CPF and 202 convictions for late payment last year. All convicted employers were fined and ordered by the Subordinate Courts to pay the CPF arrears.\n\nThe CPF Board has increased the general penalties for non-compliance of the CPF Act. From Jan 1 this year, first-time offenders may be fined up to $5,000 and/or jailed for up to six months. Repeat offenders face fines of up to $10,000 and/or jail of up to 12 months.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Singapore had a slice of the action this week, when a Sinochem unit's maiden Singapore dollar debt sale was almost 10 times subscribed.\n\nFar East Horizon Ltd made a strong debut on the local bond market on Thursday. The Hong Kong-listed Chinese financial services company, a unit of China's largest trading firm, attracted $3.8 billion in orders for its debut issue of $400 million 31/2-year 4.25 per cent bonds.\n\nBy allocation, private banks had 52 per cent of the issue, fund managers 24 per cent, life insurers 17 per cent and other banks 7 per cent.\n\nDealogic data as reported by Finance Asia showed that Asia ex-Japan US dollar-denominated bond volume hit US$26.8 billion so far in April, 7.5 per cent higher than the last record-breaking monthly figure of US$25 billion in January.\n\nInvestors are searching for yield, shrugging off geopolitical uncertainties.\n\n\"During the first quarter of the year, capital markets were hit by tensions in Crimea. Though tensions remain elevated in Ukraine, capital market activities have picked up,\" said Neel Gopalakrishnan, emerging markets bond analyst, Credit Suisse Private Banking and Wealth Management.\n\nEarlier concerns of increased indebtedness caused by slowing economic growth are also fading. China grew 7.4 per cent in the first quarter of this year, the slowest clip since Q2 2012.\n\nSaid Harsh Agarwal, Deutsche Bank's head of Asia Credit Research: \"One of the key things that matters for credit is short-term rates, and as long as interest rates remain low - close to zero in many countries - investors will be incentivised to buy credit because credit enables them to gain a spread over the risk-free rate.\"\n\n\"Also, although the fundamentals for Asian companies have deteriorated slightly, I don't expect default rates to go up, which is generally supportive for credit.\"\n\nMr Agarwal noted that while supply was high with new issues continuing to come out, much of this issuance was to refinance existing debt which does not create additional leverage on companies' balance sheets.\n\nThe majority of the issuance in this latest round is being taken up by investors outside Asia - in the United States and Europe - which means there is not much additional supply pressure on Asian investors, he said.\n\nElaine Ngim, Coutts's head of fixed income in Asia, said US institutional funds were allocating more into emerging markets, while retail participation in Asia has been extremely small in comparison.\n\nShe said: \"A few reasons driving this demand include increase in allocation into emerging markets, confidence in China's state-owned enterprises has not really quite faltered previously and default scares have been around small weaker corporates.\n\n\"This demand also reflects a renewed confidence that any probable defaults could be contained with no systematic risk.\"\n\nMr Gopalakrishnan noted that a review of the allocations of recent jumbo-sized bonds by Chinese issuers showed that most of the tranches of these bonds (greater than 50 per cent) went to US investors, which were mainly fund managers and insurance companies.\n\n\"These investors take advantage of an opportunity to invest in these investment-grade bonds at decent yield levels,\" he said.\n\nOn April 2, China Petrochemical Corp issued US$5 billion of bonds in multiple tranches in what was the largest Asian debt sale in more than a decade. This was followed by China National Offshore Oil Corporation's US$4 billion issuance this week. This week, Tencent Holdings sold US$2.5 billion in bonds, the largest tech bond issue from Asia ex-Japan.\n\nAs to whether there will be more spillover from the China bond fever to Singapore, Clifford Lee, DBS head of fixed income, had this to say: \"The SGD deal market is always more stable - on the upside as well as the downside.\"\n\n\"All the same, the SGD bond volumes have been building up well,\" he said.\n\nYear to date, SGD issuances reached $7.1 billion, up a touch from $6.9 billion in January-April 2012, according to Thomson Reuters.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That's the most since 2012 and the highest versus average levels since 2004, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Bank of America Corp.

Some 48 per cent of postcodes recorded an increase, the highest proportion in a decade.\n\nHouse prices are being driven by record-low Bank of England interest rates, a shortage of property for sale and a strengthening economy that's creating jobs. Officials have said that they're monitoring the market for signs price increases may jeopardise financial stability.\n\n\"The pick-up in the coverage of price rises is very clear-cut,\" said Richard Donnell, director of research at Hometrack. \"Improving market sentiment and low mortgage rates are supporting increased activity.\"\n\nNew buyers registering with real-estate agents to browse property rose 3.3 per cent, compared with a 6.6 per cent increase the previous month. The time a property is on the market before it sells dropped to 6.3 weeks, the lowest since June 2007.\n\nPrices rose in all 10 regions covered by Hometrack. Gains were led by a 0.8 per cent increase in London, though there were emerging signs of \"price resistance\" in the capital.

High-yield bonds in Asia posted higher spreads than those in the West as well.\n\nThe spread is the difference between the yield of a bond, and the yield of its benchmark, which makes the higher spread of two classes of similar bonds more attractive.\n\nAsian high-grade credit also outshone equities on a total returns basis for the quarter, though Asifma noted that this comes on the back of \"marked underperformance\" of credit markets last year.\n\n\"The US Federal Reserve's continued tapering, together with veiled suggestions on the part of the Fed that interest rates might rise sooner than expected, has clouded the outlook for corporate profits,\" said the regional trade association.\n\nAsifma expects more Asian bonds in the later quarters, even as concerns over an economic slowdown in China had dampened the volume of debt issuance for the three months ended March 31.\n\nFor the first quarter, total value of issuance of Asian debt denominated in the G-3 currencies was down 13.7 per cent year-on-year at US$39.7 billion.\n\nThe total from bonds issued in Asia in local currencies stood at US$157 billion, plunging 45.3 per cent over the year. Notably, Chinese bonds still constituted the bulk of outstanding local-currency debt. It made up about half of all outstanding local currency debt in Asia, at US$4.7 trillion out of US$9 trillion.\n\nAsifma said that the Asian bond market should be lifted, with a wave of redemptions of US$120 billion due in the next two years, and as Asian corporates need funds for capex and investments.\n\n\"As tighter bank capital requirements continue to have an adverse impact on bank balance sheets, bond issuance will continue to take up some of the slack,\" the report said. Some attention will fall on the issuance of high-yield Chinese debt, which are largely used by Chinese developers.\n\nSome US$5 billion in property-related bonds were priced in the first quarter - these made up the largest share of high-yield Asian bond issuance in G-3 currencies. Proposed government support for onshore credit support for Chinese companies' offshore operations could prompt more issuances later, Asifma said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This translated into earnings per share of 1.4 Singapore cents, compared to 0.8 cent last year.\n\nRevenue climbed 2.4 per cent to 3.17 trillion rupiah.\n\nThe palm oil, rubber and sugar firm recorded a foreign exchange gain of 85.7 billion rupiah, compared to a loss of 3.7 billion rupiah last year. This was partially offset by a 62.1 per cent drop in other operating income to 22 billion rupiah, and an increase in its share of losses from an associate company and a joint venture.\n\nThe firm had seen a 29 per cent increase in inter-segment sale, much of which was palm oil sold to its refineries in anticipation of a ramp-up in production for the peak season in the next few months. A profit of 134 billion rupiah is therefore likely to be realised in the next quarter, it said.\n\nAnd while agricultural markets may be bracing for El Nino that is expected to take place in the second half of this year, weather woes in the first quarter of this year could already have an impact on the firm.\n\nDry weather in Indonesia in the first quarter - partly why CPO prices have risen - could affect IndoAgri's fresh fruit bunches production in the near term, said its CEO Mark Wakeford, who added that it is too early to fully assess the impact. IndoAgri aims to grow 5-10 per cent in its production for the full year.\n\nThe drought in Brazil has also led IndoAgri to lower its sugar crushing forecast from 3.6 million tonnes to 3.3 million tonnes. This, however, would still be 10 per cent higher than last year, noted Mr Wakeford.\n\nIn its edible oil and fat business, the group is now positioning itself for the new law in Indonesia which disallows the bulk purchase of cooking oil from Jan 1 next year.\n\n\"We're looking at being ready and capable of expanding our presence in that market,\" Mr Wakeford said during its results briefing.\n\nThe firm now occupies 40-45 per cent of the edible oil and fats market in Indonesia, and has a strong presence in the supply of margarine for the industrial market.\n\nIndoAgri is also on the lookout for expansion opportunities outside of Indonesia, particularly in the equatorial belt, he added. It will also expand its current footprint in Brazil, where it completed its acquisition of sugar mill CMAA last year.\n\nThe group derived 87.4 per cent of its revenue from Indonesia in the first quarter.\n\nIndoAgri's shares yesterday rose 1.5 cents to close at $1.065.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/sti-reserve-list-bench-benchmark", "site_title": "STI Reserve List: From the bench to the benchmark", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nSTI Reserve List: From the bench to the benchmark\n\nExposure to the STI can give investors access to the stability and diversity of the index's component stocks, writes GEOFF HOWIE\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Apr 27, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nBEGINNER investors are likely to be more familiar with the English Premier League than they are with their local stock market. In some ways, stock market indexes are very similar to professional league football clubs.\n\nIn most cases, they include many of the biggest and most high-profile players of the markets they represent.\n\nAnd like some of the better-known football clubs (think Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool), stock market indexes have become household names in their own right, even among households with little or no knowledge of financial markets or football.\n\nThe Straits Times Index (STI), a composite benchmark comprising 30 of the largest stocks listed on Singapore Exchange (SGX), is one such index that rates a mention in global news wraps every day, along with Japan's Nikkei 225, the NASDAQ Composite in the US and the FTSE 100 in the UK.\n\nThe STI's performance is seen as a good partial indicator of what is happening in the Singapore stock market.\n\nWhat's in a benchmark?\n\nThe combined market weight of the 30 stocks in the STI accounts for more than half of the entire capitalisation of the Singapore stock market.\n\nThe benchmark's constituent stocks include several large, well-known local corporations, such as Singapore Airlines, DBS Group, SingTel and CapitaLand.\n\nTo qualify for inclusion in the STI, stocks need both market capitalisation and liquidity, the latter being a criteria that can render some otherwise very large stocks ineligible for inclusion.\n\nWhile the large and established \"blue chip\" STI stocks generally do not offer the sorts of risk to potential return associated with more speculative and younger listings, they are often well placed to deliver steady and regular income streams to investors through dividends and distributions.\n\nAs an investible index, the STI is also synonymous with investment diversity. The cluster of 30 counters includes significant reach into the geographic markets of Asia and beyond, in both emerging and advanced economies. They offer exposure to as many as 14 sectors as defined by the Industrial Classification Benchmark.\n\nAnd while the STI is naturally home to Singapore's largest home-grown listings, many of the constituent stocks report a large part of their revenue from outside the city-state.\n\nThe STI's general performance is often seen as a proxy for the health of corporate Singapore. Perhaps more importantly, as Singapore is a small, well-managed, globally integrated and open economy, the STI is seen as a leading indicator on the health of global and regional economic activity.\n\nAs at April 22, the STI outperformed other major global benchmarks on a Singapore dollar basis. Year to that date, the index was up 3.5 per cent, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.9 per cent, the Nikkei 225 was down 9.1 per cent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 3 per cent.\n\nThe dividend yield associated with the STI is 3.2 per cent, with all 30 constituents maintaining an indicative dividend yield. This reporting season has brought a slew of dividend activity with 13 of the 30 STI stocks going ex-dividend either last week or this week.\n\nOn a side note, to qualify to receive the dividend, investors must be holding the stock on the trading day before the ex-dividend date. Thus, buyers of the stocks on the ex-dividend date will not receive the most recently declared dividend.\n\nIndicative yields range from 0.7 per cent for Jardine Strategic Holdings to 8.5 per cent for Hutchison Port Holdings Trust. The five highest indicative dividend yields in the index are maintained by Hutchison Port Holdings Trust, CapitaMall Trust, Starhub, SingTel and SIA Engineering. While dividends are important to investors seeking income, the most active stocks in terms of turnover do not necessarily have the highest dividend yields.\n\nIn 2013, the five most-traded STI stocks in terms of turnover velocity (a liquidity measure of how much a stock is traded based on the ratio between its monthly share turnover and its month-end market capitalisation) were Golden Agri-Resources, Noble Group, Global Logistics Properties, Singapore Press Holdings and ComfortDelGro Corporation.\n\nLike the English Premier League, there can be a difference between the highest paying football clubs, most active players and the final winners.\n\nThe STI reserve list\n\nWhile the STI and many of its components are well known and highly regarded, what is generally less well known to less active market participants is how the index is managed and constructed.\n\nJust like a premier league football club, the STI's component players must maintain index eligibility. If they are unable to maintain that eligibility, they would be replaced by stocks on what is known as the STI Reserve List, or \"the bench\", to continue the football metaphor.\n\nA stock could be deleted by the index due to the company's own eligibility through a corporate event that could result in the delisting of a company.\n\nLast year, Fraser & Neave was deleted from the STI from April 3, with STI Reserve List constituent Hutchison Port Holdings Trust added to the STI.\n\nThis followed the completion of the cash offer by TCC Assets Ltd in conjunction with the constituent ground rules.\n\nIt is important to note that the STI Reserve List only comes into play during the intra-review period.\n\nThis is because the review period sees all the companies or trusts re-ranked according to their full market cap, with free float and liquidity criteria applied.\n\nBuffer rules come into play during the reviews to determine the movement of the constituent/non-constituent into the STI and STI Reserve List.\n\nThis means that during the review period, stocks on or outside of the STI Reserve List, can be reshuffled into the STI starting line-up or relegated out of the list.\n\nThe STI Reserve List includes five stocks and currently comprises Ascendas Real Estate Investment Trust, Keppel Land, UOL Group, CapitaCommercial Trust and Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Holdings.\n\nAs property plays a significant part in Singapore's economy, it's not surprising that four out of these five counters are in the real estate sector. Yangzijiang Shipbuilding joined the STI Reserve List in September 2013, replacing Suntec Reit.\n\nWith a combined market capitalisation near $25 billion, these five stocks have an average total return of 6 per cent so far this year, with a median return of 7.2 per cent.\n\nThe five stocks currently maintain an average indicative dividend yield of 4.3 per cent. The two best performing stocks among the five were CapitaCommercial Trust and Ascendas Reit.\n\nWho's on the bench?\n\nAscendas Reit was the first business space and industrial Reit to list on SGX. It owns a portfolio of properties in Singapore comprising business and science parks, hi-tech industrial spaces, light industrial spaces and logistic and distribution centres.\n\nThey house a tenant base of more than 700 international and local companies from various industries. Ascendas Reit has a market capitalisation of $5.6 billion and has generated a total gain of 9.1 per cent as at April 22. The indicative dividend yield of Ascendas Reit is 6 per cent.\n\nKeppel Land is the property arm of the Keppel Group. As a property development company in Asia, it is engaged in residential developments and commercial properties.\n\nIt is geographically diversified in Asia with a footprint in Singapore, China, Vietnam and Indonesia. Keppel Land has a market capitalisation of $5.3 billion and has generated a year-to-date return gain of 7.2 per cent as at April 22. The indicative dividend yield of Keppel Land is 3.8 per cent.\n\nUOL Group's principal activities include the development of commercial and residential properties in prime locations both in Singapore and overseas. It also has interests in hotel development and management, retail and investment holding.\n\nUOL Group has a market capitalisation of $5 billion and has generated a total return of 5 per cent so far this year as at April 22. The indicative dividend yield of UOL Group is 2.3 per cent.\n\nCapitaCommercial Trust is a Reit sponsored by STI-component property developer CapitaLand. It invests in a portfolio of office and commercial properties in Singapore's central area, such as Capital Tower, Six Battery Road, HSBC Building, Raffles City and Bugis Village.\n\nCapitaCommercial Trust has a market capitalisation of $4.6 billion and has generated a total return of 13.9 per cent so far this year as at April 22. The indicative dividend yield of CapitaCommercial Trust is 5.2 per cent.\n\nYangzijiang Shipbuilding Holdings is the only stock in the STI Reserve List that is not in the property sector.\n\nIt makes a range of commercial vessels, including mini bulk carriers, bulk carriers, multi-purpose cargo vessels, containerships, chemical tankers, offshore supply vessels, rescue and salvage vessels and lifting vessels.\n\nThe group operates two yards through its subsidiaries and has a market capitalisation of $4.3 billion. So far this year, its stock has declined 5.1 per cent.\n\nThe indicative dividend yield of Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Holdings is 4.4 per cent. Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Holdings is also the largest constituent of the FTSE ST Maritime Index and is also quoted in Chinese renminbi (RMB) using SGX's dual currency trading platform.\n\nWhy STI composition matters\n\nMany managed funds track benchmark indexes such as the STI and construct their portfolios to match the composition of the relevant index.\n\nExposure to the STI, either directly or indirectly, can give investors access to the stability and diversity of the index's component stocks.\n\nWith the help of the index provider, FTSE Group, the index methodology and ground rules are publicly available on a website.\n\nAll industry index users are able to accurately predict the review changes as a result and it's important to note that not every index review results in a change in the STI reserve list or STI components.\n\nAs an investible index, the STI is accessible via two SGX-listed exchange traded funds (ETFs): the Nikko Asset Management STI ETF and the SPDR STI ETF.\n\nThese are open-ended funds that can be easily bought and sold on the exchange and are also accessible through regular savings plans.\n\nThese two ETFs distribute dividends (in Singapore dollars) and trade like stocks, with the respective exchange codes of ES3 and G3B.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Government surveys of the two sectors, conducted in March and April, show that businesses optimistic about the six months till September outnumbered those who are pessimistic.\n\nOf the more than 400 manufacturers polled by the Economic Development Board (EDB), a weighted 12 per cent expect better business conditions from April to September, compared to first quarter of this year, while a weighted 5 per cent think conditions may deteriorate.\n\nThis means a positive net weighted balance of 7 per cent, up from 4 per cent in the January edition of the quarterly survey. This measure of the difference between the proportion of firms that are optimistic and those that are not is often used to reflect how widespread positive or negative business sentiment is.\n\nAmong the industrial clusters, precision engineering was the most bullish. A net weighted 24 per cent of firms in the cluster expect better prospects over the next six months, three times more positive than the 8 per cent a quarter ago.\n\nThanks to stronger demand in the global semiconductor market and the improving US and Europe economies, the machinery and systems segment expects orders for semiconductor-related equipment to rise. Firms making precision modules and components also foresee more orders from both local and overseas markets in the next six months, EDB said.\n\nThe cheerier global outlook for semiconductors has also sparked optimism among electronics firms. Pessimistic electronics manufacturers had outweighed optimistic ones in the January survey by a margin of 5 per cent. But this round, firms expecting business conditions to improve outnumbered the ones who did not by 4 per cent.\n\nSimilarly, firms in Singapore's services sectors are now more positive about business prospects than they were a quarter ago. Of the 1,500 services firms polled by the Department of Statistics (DOS), a weighted 15 per cent expect business conditions to improve. This was unchanged from the survey in January. But the weighted proportion of firms expecting a deterioration in business conditions fell from 14 per cent in the previous survey to 10 per cent, leaving a stronger net weighted balance of 5 per cent than January's one per cent.\n\nFirms offering transport and storage services were the most optimistic about business prospects for the April to September period. \"In particular, shipping lines expect a higher volume of business as they foresee improvements in the global economy,\" DOS said. The gradual global economic recovery was also cited by banks and finance companies as the reason for their improved outlook.\n\nBut there remained pockets of pessimism. In fact, gloom seemed to deepen in the retail trade and the real estate sectors.\n\nSupermarkets and department stores said that there is a tendency for sales during the April-September period to be slower than the October-March period, which coincides with the festive season. A net weighted 13 per cent of them expect business to worsen over the six months.\n\nDevelopers also continued to cite the total debt servicing ratio framework as a reason for their negative outlook. A net weighted 25 per cent of firms in real estate predict a slowdown in business in the six months till September. As for manufacturing, the chemicals cluster of firms reported a net weighted balance of negative one per cent, largely due to the petroleum refining segment, where refining margins are expected to stay soft in the months ahead.\n\nEven so, general optimism could exacerbate an already tight labour market. A net weighted 9 per cent of manufacturers said that they plan to hire more workers in Q2 than they had in Q1, with biomedical and general manufacturing firms most upbeat about this. And in services sectors, which tend to be more labour intensive, a net weighted balance of 14 per cent of firms - particularly wholesalers of machinery, equipment and household goods - intend to raise headcount in Q2.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The tender for the site closes on Aug 19.\n\nThe government yesterday also made available for application on the reserve list an executive condominium (EC) site at the corner of Sembawang Road and Canberra Link, although most market watchers are not expecting it to be triggered for launch anytime soon as there is sufficient EC supply.\n\nBoth sites have 99-year leasehold tenures.\n\nSites on the reserve list are launched for tender upon successful application by a developer with an undertaking of a minimum bid price acceptable to the State. Confirmed list sites, on the other hand, are launched for tender according to a known schedule, regardless of demand.\n\nThe 1.6 hectare Potong Pasir site, located along Meyappa Chettiar Road, can be developed into a 13 to 16-storey project with a maximum gross floor area (GFA) of 56,523 square metres (608,408 square feet). Of this, a maximum 5,000 sq m (53,819.5 sq ft) - or 8.8 per cent of the total GFA - can be for commercial use. This includes a 500 sq m (about 5,382 sq ft) cap for restaurant use - due to traffic congestion issues. The Urban Redevelopment Authority has also banned uses such as bars, pubs, karaoke lounges, night clubs and massage parlours for the project's commercial component - as they cause or pose disamenities such as noise, disorderly behaviour and other disturbances to residents of the project as well as surrounding developments.\n\nURA has set a 5,000 sq m cap for total commercial use as there are already other retail facilities in the vicinity and in order not to strain the capacity of the road network in the area.\n\nThe project's residential component can generate an estimated 685 private homes. A through-block link has been safeguarded in the development to make it convenient for commuters to walk from the MRT station to the HDB neighbourhood centre.\n\nCBRE Research head Desmond Sim said: \"We expect bids to come in from blue-chip developers as well as some joint ventures to mitigate the equity investment and market risk.\"\n\nThis will be the fifth site that URA will be selling around Potong Pasir MRT Station since 2010. The earlier plots are now being developed into three condo projects - Nin Residence, Sennett Residence and Sant Ritz - and a mixed development, The Venue Residences and Shoppes.\n\nLee Lay Keng, DTZ regional head (SEA), Research, predicts an $800-900 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr) top bid. This is higher than the $793 psf ppr at which The Venue site nearby was awarded in September 2012 - because of the bigger commercial component compared with the earlier plot's 2,000 sq m.\n\nJones Lang LaSalle national director Ong Teck Hui said: \"With residential units in nearby developments currently selling for around $1,400 psf, bidders are likely to use this as a reference point in their pricing but also take into account a likely softening in prices by the time the project is launched for sale.\"\n\nAs for the Sembawang EC site, consultants' estimates of its pricing range from $280 to $350 psf ppr. R'ST Research director Ong Kah Seng reckons that the earliest the plot could be triggered for release from the reserve list would be in late-Q3 or in Q4 this year. \"There's some sense of oversaturation of new private homes and ECs in the immediate vicinity and in the Sembawang location in general.\"\n\nA City Developments-TID consortium bagged the next door EC plot at a state tender that closed in January this year at $350 psf ppr. At the 506-unit SkyPark Residences, a nearby EC project that was launched in Q4 last year, only 293 units were sold as at end-Q1 this year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Last month, prices of completed condos fell 1.1 per cent month on month, going by the Singapore Residential Price Index released by the NUS yesterday, which is based on a basket that tracks the month-on-month price movements of private homes.\n\nDevelopers that have already purchased land from the Government Land Sales programme could see their net margins staying at 9-10 per cent, down from 24 per cent in 2012, Mr Chong said.\n\nMargin compression is holding developers back from aggressive land bidding now.\n\nAn analysis of winning bids by BNP Paribas shows that the margin buffers - the difference between the prevailing price of launches in the vicinity and the development costs of the land - has widened, suggesting that the developer wants more cushion from the risk of lower selling prices.\n\nA case in point is the recent winning bid for the 99-year leasehold site at Prince Charles Crescent (Parcel B), which has a margin buffer of about 16.7 per cent above the historical mean of 11.9 per cent, BNP Paribas estimates.\n\nForeign developers have often been blamed for bidding up land prices.\n\nBNP Paribas' analysis shows that foreign developers are indeed more aggressive in their bids. They have a smaller margin buffer of 10.6 per cent than the overall market sample of 11.9 per cent on average, while their winning bid premium over the median bid also tends to be higher at 20.2 per cent compared to the total sample mean of 17.8 per cent.\n\nChinese developer Kingsford, for instance, secured two sites in Upper Serangoon last December at a bid premium of 23-27 per cent over the median bids.\n\nAccording to SLP International, foreign players' participation rate has increased to 26 per cent last year from 8 per cent in 2009, mainly bolstered by the entry of Chinese developers that tend to favour executive condominium (EC) sites.\n\nThe average land costs of EC sites have risen to $330 psf last year from $270 psf in 2011, BNP Paribas' Mr Chong said.\n\nDuring this period, EC launch prices also increased to $800 psf, up from $700-750 psf.\n\nWith the \"potential bottoming-out process in the land market\", well-capitalised developers such as CapitaLand, Keppel Land and City Developments have the opportunity to restock their depleting land bank at lower prices, Mr Chong said.\n\nNon-traditional developers that include niche boutique Singapore developers, construction firms and foreign developers saw their share of winning land bids rise from 18.3 per cent in 2009 to 71.5 per cent last year.\n\nThis has fallen to 63 per cent year-to-date, reflecting easing competition for land, he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Singapore is one of the world's most vibrant arbitration centres, with the government supporting its development through favourable legislation and the creation of Maxwell Chambers (the world's first integrated dispute resolution complex).\n\n\"Those measures, combined with the ongoing success of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), mean that Singapore is now certainly on par with the more traditional arbitration jurisdictions of London, Paris, New York and Hong Kong.\"\n\nSingapore is regarded as the most popular seat of arbitration in Asia, according to international law firm White & Case's 2010 International Arbitration Survey. It is also the third most preferred seat worldwide - along with Tokyo and Paris - after London and Geneva.\n\nOne reason for Ms Reed's move is Asia's tremendous growth potential. Freshfields wants to cement its international arbitration presence in the region and capitalise on its growth, having established its practice in the West.\n\n\"Singapore is on the doorstep of one of the world's fastest-growing - and most likely busiest regions - for arbitration in the years to come. The South-east Asian and South Asian economies are seeing a significant new wave of investment, and with that, the potential for increased arbitration activity,\" she said.\n\n\"South-east Asia is made up of so many high-growth economies - each with their own commercial and political pressures - that companies are looking for a way to mitigate issues like sovereign risk and shifting legal environments. Our experience in places like South America and Eastern Europe has consistently shown us that arbitration centres are vital to mitigating those sorts of risks.\"\n\nMs Reed said Freshfields has a core team of around 10 arbitration lawyers in Asia - with half of those already in Singapore and a sizable number of Singaporeans on the team, including partner John Choong who runs its Hong Kong arbitration practice. Freshfields' international arbitration team is made up of 150 lawyers in 15 offices worldwide.\n\n\"We expect our Singapore arbitration practice to grow substantially over the next decade, perhaps doubling in size in the next few years. We will be bringing more Singaporean lawyers into the group as well,\" Ms Reed said.\n\nThe news no doubt bodes well for Singapore arbitration lawyers looking to join a global practice.\n\nMs Reed has worked on some of the most significant public and private arbitrations in the world. She advised ConocoPhillips on its pending multi-billion dollar International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) arbitration against Venezuela, and represented CMS Energy in obtaining the first ICSID Bilateral Investment Treaty award against Argentina in 2007.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/what-peg-reit-managers-fees", "site_title": "What to peg Reit managers' fees to?", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nWhat to peg Reit managers' fees to?\n\nPublished\n\nMon, Apr 28, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nDIFFERENT real estate investment trusts (Reits) employ different performance fee structures with which to reward their managers. As private investor Bobby Jayaraman, who authored the book Building wealth through Reits, noted, there is no completely fair fee structure, but some do have more drawbacks than others.\n\nOne of these drawbacks was brought to the fore and ''rectified'' earlier this month when the management of Cambridge Industrial Trust (CIT) announced that it will revise the way it calculates its performance fees. The revised methodology will effectively slash fees by up to 50 per cent. This move was, unsurprisingly, lauded by analysts and unitholders.\n\nThe industrial Reit is one of just two Singapore-listed Reits to benchmark its total returns (comprising change in unit price and distribution per unit or DPU) against those of a basket of other Reits.\n\nThe only other Reit with a similar practice is Starhill Global Reit which holds retail and office assets in Singapore and overseas. The difference is that Starhill benchmarks itself to a much larger sample of 30 other Reits and trusts, compared to CIT's basket of less than 10.\n\nWhat motivated CIT to ''voluntarily and irrevocably'' waive half of its fees of $27.7 million in H1 2013 to a final fee of $13.9 million, was its outperformance against the basket of Reits by a whopping 16.9 per cent.\n\nDuring the period, CIT delivered a return of 10.9 per cent (it declared a total distribution per unit of 2.474 cents, while its unit price rose 5.8 per cent from 68.5 cents to 72.5 cents), whereas the benchmark index returned a negative 6 per cent. Such outplay led the Reit manager's original performance fees to balloon eight times, from its fees of just $3.3 million in H2 2012.\n\nAccording to a report by Standard Chartered analyst Kai Yip last year, while CIT announced a Q2 2013 DPU of 1.24 cents, its adjusted earnings per unit (EPU) whittled down to 0.01 cent.\n\nThere are arguments for and against factoring unit price into the calculation of performance fees. Interestingly, both sides are premised on the basis that unit prices are not within the company's control.\n\nSome Reit managers peg their performance fees to DPU growth. DPU is unlike unit price in that it can be paid out of a Reit's capital and so is within the manager's control. Granted, this is not usually practised, although CIT would have had to do so if it did not tweak the formula to halve its performance fees in H1 2013. Paying fees out of one's capital is also not sustainable as the Reit's net asset value would drop as a result.\n\nUnit price, on the other hand, is a function of the market's sentiment and confidence in a Reit. They may therefore be speculative and temporary - fuelled by news of yield-accretive acquisitions and property renovations - without translating into a sustained long-term performance.\n\nThe most common performance fee structure used by two-thirds of the Reits here is the pegging of fees to gross or net property income (NPI).\n\nThis has the easiest potential for abuse because income can be driven up simply through acquisitions to boost assets under management. NPI can also grow without DPU growth, for instance, when Reits issue equity to fund investments, which leads to equity dilution. This might explain why a handful of Reit managers that peg fees to NPI also add a caveat - a minimum DPU growth - before they are entitled to performance fees.\n\nThe third structure which pegs performance fees to DPU growth has gained traction after Mapletree Greater China Commercial Trust adopted it when it listed last March. A few recently listed Reits, including OUE Commercial Reit and Viva Industrial Trust, have adopted it, promising better alignment to unitholders' interests: ''We get paid more only if you get paid more.''\n\nThis structure is arguably less stringent than the benchmark-based structure which is cumulative, meaning a Reit needs to outdo its outperformance in the previous year in order to earn its fees this year.\n\nThe manager of Starhill Global Reit, which benchmarks itself against practically the whole Reit market here including the faster-growing small-cap ones, said it has collected less than $100,000 in performance fees since its listing in 2005. The manager of CIT, which listed in 2006, only received its first performance fees in 2012, following a steep rise in its stock price during the year.\n\nAbove all, perhaps it matters less which structure is adopted as it does the calibre and integrity of the Reit manager as all systems can be abused, Mr Jayaraman has noted. Investors would therefore do well to examine the track record of Reits and their incentive structure before buying into them.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

EDB said the segment expanded 45.1 per cent, with \"several rig building and ship building projects achieving milestone completion\" last month.\n\nAll other clusters also expanded in March. Electronics production grew 8.7 per cent, driven by a 14.1 per cent output increase in the semiconductors segment. Expansion was also seen in the chemicals (5.2 per cent), precision engineering (4.3 per cent) and general manufacturing industries (one per cent) clusters.\n\nIn sequential terms, manufacturing output outstripped market expectations of a 6.1 per cent increase from February, after seasonal adjustments. The nine economists polled by Bloomberg had a median forecast of 1.5 per cent month-on-month growth.\n\nExcluding biomedical manufacturing, output rose 1.6 per cent from the previous month, EDB said.\n\nWith March's exceptionally strong performance, economists from CIMB, OCBC and UOB expect Q1 manufacturing growth to come in at 9.8 per cent from a year ago - higher than the official estimate of 8 per cent.\n\nIn line with this, economists predict upward revisions in the government's Q1 GDP advance estimates, both in year-ago and sequential terms.\n\nNew growth forecasts range from 5.5 to 6.1 per cent year on year (from the official estimate of 5.1 per cent), and 1.8 to 3.6 per cent quarter on quarter (from 0.1 per cent).\n\nANZ and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) economists noted that March's robust factory output occurred despite a sharply weaker non-oil domestic exports (NODX) figure in the same month. NODX fell 6.6 per cent from a year ago, against the 0.5 per cent growth forecast by the market.\n\nSaid ANZ's Daniel Wilson and Glenn Maguire in a research note: \"We still view the sharp fall in NODX as temporary and we will likely see that converging to industrial production, rather than industrial production growth down to the NODX growth rates.\"\n\nWhile BAML's Chua Hak Bin thinks factory output \"should probably hold up\", he does not expect the headline number to look as fantastic. \"This (rate of) growth is just far too strong, and the base last year was low as well,\" said Dr Chua, who expects industrial production to average 4.5 to 5 per cent for the rest of the year.\n\nUOB economist Francis Tan is estimating a more modest average monthly growth rate of 4.1 per cent in coming months.\n\nAt the same time, CIMB's Song Seng Wun and DBS's Irvin Seah cautioned against getting carried away with March's bullish showing, given that the broad-based growth was largely driven by unpredictable segments.\n\nOf the 12.1 per cent increase in March's factory output, Mr Song estimates that almost 5 percentage points came from transport engineering, while the biomedical manufacturing cluster contributed about 4 percentage points.\n\nAdded Mr Seah: \"Biomedical manufacturing (has a reputation for) being volatile, and the push from the (marine & offshore engineering segment) is a factor that tends to be a bit lumpy. When orders are delivered, you'll see this sort of jump - but that's not going to happen all the time.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

At over 800 square metres, it is bigger than the airline's existing lounge at Terminal 1.\n\nThe hybrid T4, which is being built on the former site of the Budget Terminal, will cater to both narrow-body and wide-body planes.\n\nAirport operator Changi Airport Group (CAG) has said previously that T4 will have more automated initiatives such as self-service check-in, bag drop, immigration clearance and boarding gate services, to better utilise manpower resources in Singapore's tight labour market. However, manual check-in counters will also be available. Some of these self-service options - such as self-check-in and self-gate boarding - are presently being tested out at existing terminals in the airport. According to CAG, it is also in talks with several other airlines which have indicated their interest to operate at T4.\n\n\"Operating at Changi Airport's T4 offers us the perfect opportunity to bring self-service and automated options to more of our passengers, giving them more control over how they want to use their time at the airport,\" said Wilson Yam, general manager (South-east Asia) for Cathay Pacific. \"With the exciting range of shopping and dining options lined up at Terminal 4, we envisage that the time savings, and in turn the improved travel experience, will be appreciated by our discerning passengers.\"\n\nCathay Pacific, which has operated at Changi since the airport opened its first terminal in 1981, has grown its presence since then. Today, it is among the 10 biggest carriers at Changi in terms of passenger volume and operates some 130 weekly flights to and from Singapore. Changi is also one of the airline's largest bases outside of Hong Kong.\n\nYam Kum Weng, CAG's executive vice-president (air hub and development), said, commenting on Cathay Pacific opting to relocate to T4: \"It underscores the airline's confidence in the Changi brand, and in the premium experience that Changi Airport provides to passengers. Cathay also shares CAG's service excellence philosophy, which makes it an excellent partner for us to realise new breakthroughs in passenger experience, efficiency and manpower productivity together.\"\n\nT4 - which offers a handling capacity of about 16 million passengers per year - and the upcoming mixed-use development Project Jewel will collectively boost Changi's capacity from 66 million annually to about 85 million by 2018. The airport, which is already working on plans to have Terminal 5 up and running by the mid-2020s, is ramping up capacity to cater to growing travel demand, especially as other airports around the region upgrade and expand their own facilities.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The incident has put the carrier under global scrutiny, jeopardising its reputation and prompting boycotts by travel agents in China.\n\nAnalysts now project losses through 2016 and the Subang, Malaysia-based company is trading near the lowest since 2001 relative to its assets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Split up, the government-controlled airline could fetch US$1.3 billion, an amount that's more than 10 per cent higher than the company's market value last week, said Malayan Banking.\n\n\"In this kind of environment, they have the sympathy of the whole world if they want to do a restructuring,\" said James Lau, who helps manage US$300 million at Pheim Asset Management in Kuala Lumpur, referring to Malaysian Air. \"Shareholders would like to see them take the hard decisions.\"\n\nThe jet with 239 passengers and crew vanished from civilian radars while headed north over the Gulf of Thailand. It then doubled back over Peninsular Malaysia and flew south into some of the world's most remote waters.\n\nNo physical trace of the aircraft has been found. The search, now focused on an area 4.8 kilometres below the surface of the Indian Ocean, is the longest for a missing passenger plane in modern aviation history.\n\nIn China, home to most of the missing aircraft's passengers, travel agents ELong and Ly.com have stopped selling tickets for Malaysian Air flights. Qunar Cayman Islands, a travel website controlled by Baidu, also boycotted the business. Baidu owns China's most popular search engine.\n\nAlready, there are more vacant seats on Malaysian Air's international flights. Planes on those routes last month were on average 74 per cent full, the lowest figure in almost two years, company filings show. In the same month last year, average seat occupancy was 80 per cent.\n\nBefore the plane disappeared, Malaysian Air had been struggling with increased competition and higher costs. Rivals such as AirAsia have flooded the region with planes and driven down fares. Malaysian Air missed its target to be profitable last year, as higher costs for items including fuel, maintenance and financing wiped out revenue gains.\n\nThe airline, majority owned by government investment company Khazanah Nasional, will lose another US$346 million by the end of 2016, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\"Things are not working,\" Mohshin Aziz, an analyst at Maybank in Kuala Lumpur, said. \"Doing the same thing over and over again and hoping for a different result is just plain madness.\"\n\nListing Malaysian Air's profitable divisions and selling stakes in two aviation businesses could raise RM4.15 billion (S$1.6 billion), Mr Mohshin said in an April 16 report.\n\nThe engineering business could fetch RM2 billion on the stock market, while the airport terminal services unit could be valued at RM587 million, according to Mr Mohshin. A low- cost rural service, Firefly, could be worth RM1.24 billion, he said.\n\nMalaysian Air said in a statement that it couldn't immediately comment. Khazanah won't comment on speculation, spokesman Mohd Asuki Abas said.\n\nSingapore Airlines has shown the value of such sales. In 2000, it sold stakes in SIA Engineering and Singapore Airport Terminal Services, known as Sats, in initial public offerings. Since the end of their first financial year as publicly listed entities, the two companies' combined market value has more than quadrupled to US$7.14 billion.\n\nFor Malaysian Air, IPOs would be easier if the government first bought the rest of the airline and delisted it, Mr Mohshin said. That would enable the company to focus on the loss-making airline and cargo units, and its bloated workforce, free from stock-market scrutiny, he said.\n\n\"Any opportunity to put themselves out of the spotlight will be good,\" Mr Mohshin said. \"MH370 is going to put the company under the microscope for an extended period of time.\"\n\nHiving off those profitable businesses would allow management to cut the \"excess fat\" weighing on the airline, said Mr Lau at Pheim Asset Management.\n\nMalaysian Air employees each generate US$230,000 of revenue a year, less than half the amount at Singapore Air, according to the most recent data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nWorkers at Thai Airways International and PT Garuda Indonesia also bring in more sales.\n\nThe airline could be broken up while it's still listed, so that all shareholders can reap the benefit, Mr Lau said. The stock has fallen so much that a buyout first would short-change minority investors, he said.\n\nShares of Malaysian Air have dropped 10 per cent since flight 370 disappeared on March 8, extending this year's decline to 27 per cent. That has left the airline trading at 0.93 times its book value, near the lowest level since 2001, Bloomberg data show.\n\n\"I don't see any other way than creative destruction,\" said Shukor Yusof, an independent airline analyst formerly with Standard & Poor's in Singapore.\n\n\"How much longer do you want to support a company that doesn't make money?\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

In particular, we appreciate the concern that airlines have with costs. We will continue to keep a close eye on it and ensure that Changi Airport remains competitive and offers good value for money.\"\n\n\"Partnership will be particularly important when we seek to improve productivity and innovation in Changi,\" Mr Lui added. \"Productivity improvements occur not only when we bring in new technology and equipment, but also when we refine and integrate our processes more closely. This is likely to mean changes in processes and procedures, which can be difficult.\"\n\nThe annual Changi Airline Awards is organised by airport operator Changi Airport Group (CAG).\n\nMr Lui said the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore will work with CAG to see how efforts to boost productivity can be better supported, such as through grants and incentives.\n\nLast year, Changi Airport handled a record 53.7 million passengers, up about 5 per cent year-on-year but easing from the blistering 9.6 per cent compounded annual growth rate experienced over the past five years. This year, CAG is projecting a growth rate of 3 to 5 per cent in passenger throughput, with signs of moderating growth already apparent. In Q1-14, 13.2 million passengers passed through Changi, up just 1.1 per cent from the first quarter in the previous year.\n\nStill, efforts are underway to expand passenger capacity ahead of growing travel demand and to maintain Singapore's edge as an airhub in the face of intensifying competition from airports in Asia and the Middle East.\n\nThe hybrid Terminal 4, which is being built on the site of the former Budget Terminal, will boost Changi's passenger handling capacity when it opens in 2017. In addition, mixed-use development Project Jewel will offer airport operations, retail and leisure offerings as well as hotel space, come 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, planning for a fifth terminal has already begun, with an eye on having Terminal 5 operational by the mid-2020s. By then, Changi will have a total passenger handling capacity of 135 million a year, roughly double what it is now.\n\n\"As we enter the critical construction phases of our various infrastructure projects there will be occasional inconveniences and impact to existing operations, affecting both airlines and passengers,\" Lee Seow Hiang, chief executive of CAG, acknowledged. \"But I am certain that with the assistance and cooperation of our partners, we will be able to meet our project milestones, while maintaining a consistent and high level of service to our passengers.\"\n\nAt the awards yesterday, China Eastern Airlines emerged as Partner of the Year, in recognition of its contributions to strengthening the network of services between Singapore and China. The airline is the biggest Chinese carrier operating at Changi in terms of passenger traffic, carrying more than 650,000 passengers last year.\n\nThe number of passengers travelling between the two countries grew 6.4 per cent year-on-year to 4.64 million in 2013, making China the fifth biggest source market for Changi.\n\nThe top five airlines at Changi by passenger carriage last year were Singapore Airlines (SIA), Tigerair Singapore, SilkAir, Jetstar Asia and AirAsia.\n\nMeanwhile, the top five by cargo carriage were SIA Cargo, FedEx Express, Cathay Pacific, Eva Airways and Air Hong Kong.\n\nA total of 24 awards were given out across different categories, which included top airline by absolute growth in passenger carriage (by region), top airline by absolute cargo growth as well as best airline marketing. Repeat winners included British Airways, Dubai's Emirates and India's Jet Airways.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Vard saw its operating margin during this period fall to 4.6 per cent from 10 per cent last year.\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) margin increased for the third consecutive quarter ending at 6.4 per cent, against a high Ebitda margin of 11.1 per cent for last year.\n\nVard's bottomline was most affected by an increase of 13.8 per cent in salaries and 11.1 per cent in other expenses, to 552 million krone and 150 million krone, respectively.\n\nHowever, there was also positive news for the Norwegian-based group in the first quarter as it secured eight new contracts, which increased its orderbook to a five-year high. With an order intake of 5.5 billion krone in these three months, its orderbook at the end of the quarter amounted to 21.8 billion krone, representing a 13 per cent increase from the full year 2013 and a 41 per cent increase from the same period last year.\n\nThe order intake includes an arctic Anchor Handling Tug Supply (AHTS) vessel for Bourbon, an Offshore Subsea Construction Vessel (OSCV) for Solstad Offshore - Vard's largest ever single vessel order - a Diving Support and Construction Vessel for leading subsea group Technip, and three Platform Supply Vessels (PSV) to be built at the group's yard in Vietnam, two of which are for new customer Mermaid Marine. During the quarter, Vard delivered four vessels out of Norway and Romania, and its order book as at March 31 stood at 45, of which 27, or 60 per cent, will be of Vard's own design.\n\nWhile its management remains positive on order activity for the full year 2014, it also considers the order intake in the first quarter to be exceptional.\n\nIt expects to see continued strong demand from the subsea support and construction vessel segment despite concerns over rising production cost in the oil & gas industry; it also believes that the average vessel size and complexity are expected to continue to increase.\n\nOCBC Investment Research said that it expects Vard's second half of the year to be much stronger, but also pointed out that yesterday's set of results were below its expectations, prompting its analysts to put under review its hold rating and $0.84 fair value estimate of the stock.\n\nVard fell 3.5 cents on the SGX yesterday, closing at 95.5 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

She cites the ability to communicate with people as an example. \"I want to be able to relate to people or let others relate to me, be it through content, a story or an idea,\" she says. \"I hope that as I grow as a designer, I can create products that carry these intangible values. These products not only can be created as a documentation of life but to inspire others as well.\" Ms Tan aims to do this in her job as an associate designer with Supermama, a local design firm-cum-retail store.\n\nThe company is currently working on a new product label with Japanese fabric producer Maruju. Ikue, the new product label, will launch its debut collection Animal Camou, a line of six baby items, such as bibs, blankets and towels. The collection will be launched at the Japan Interior Lifestyle fair in Tokyo in June.\n\nMs Tan's role in this collaboration was to create a print that was inspired by the patterns found on military camouflage. \"But instead of random organic patterns or pixels, I came up with the idea of printed animals that merge into each other,\" she says. The print was first exhibited at Frankfurt's Ambiente fair, a prestigious consumer goods trade fair, and as part of the Young Guns - The Young Designers Showcase in March that was part of SingaPlural, a design event to spawn fresh ideas and concepts from design players in advertising, architecture, interiors and furniture design.\n\nLast August, she created an artwork on a porcelain plate for Omega's Co-Axial Exhibition over at ION Orchard under the theme Engineered. \"This plate was inspired by one of Omega's videos - Omega Co-Axial Chronometer - from one of the scenes, where the ocean and the cityscape were all made up of mechanical gears,\" Ms Tan explains.\n\nMs Tan graduated with a diploma in experience and product design from Singapore Polytechnic last year. She decided on a career in design after noticing the word \"experience\" in the name of the course. \"The word 'experience' from my diploma really caught my eye and heart in design. This actually changed how I look at design. There are so many experiences around us that serve as inspiration that we can draw from. It will be a pity and regret to let all these go. Why not document and communicate them to others?\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Some 56 per cent of the respondents in Hong Kong work with a financial adviser, compared with 35 per cent here.\n\nThe primary goals of Singapore investors are providing for retirement, followed by growing wealth. However, only 41 and 35 per cent respectively said they were making progress towards these goals, lagging behind the global average.\n\nMatthew Schiffman, head of global marketing, said: \"While some countries have social programmes to help their retiree populations, our survey found that investors everywhere can, and should, do more to prepare for their retirement.\"\n\nInvestors in Singapore were found to be among the most bullish on equities, with 42 per cent planning on increasing their exposure this year. Some 38 per cent also indicated interest to raise their exposure to cash and cash equivalents.\n\nOver half of those without any international investments said they would consider investing for income outside of Singapore.\n\nMr Lim said: \"We expect to see a change in their approach towards investing overseas with a view to diversifying risk and improving their return on investment.\"\n\nThese investors believe that China, followed by emerging markets, and then the US, represent the markets with the best investment opportunities.\n\nMost investors in Asia also ranked those countries in the top three when asked to choose their top investment markets. Domestic stocks were also seen by most as one of the best investment opportunities for the year.\n\nInflation was rated as the top concern that could derail investment progress, both in Asia and globally.\n\nThe survey, into its second year, polled some 207 Singapore investors, with an average age of 49 years and average investible assets of US$1.2 million.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Then, many of Malaysia's deep-pocketed state-linked funds were shrouded in relative secrecy and slammed for their lack of transparency.\n\nPost Asian financial crisis and a sweeping reform of Malaysia Inc in the early 2000s, their boards and top management were revamped. With that, there was a promise of better governance. To a great extent, much has improved.\n\nBut the country's five-year-old sovereign wealth fund (SWF), 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), is tampering with that credential.\n\nFaced with pressure to disclose its latest 2013 accounts - which were delayed - and drawing more scrutiny for changing auditors for the second time since inception, 1MDB lodged the much-awaited accounts this week for the public to pore over.\n\nIndeed, Malaysiansstudied, crunched and digested the numbers, and gasped. Some figures in the accounts cemented their deepest concerns, which before this week were merely back-of-the-envelope guesses.\n\nThe fund is saddled with staggering debts of RM42 billion (S$16.1 billion), more than its 21-year-old domestic peer Khazanah Nasional, the 25th largest SWF in the world, which has less than RM30 billion in debts.\n\nIf not for a hefty RM2.7 billion revaluation gain in property assets - it reportedly got the land on the cheap from the government - which drove the fund to post a RM778 million net profit, it would have bled some RM1.9 billion.\n\nBad news also came from 1MDB's power assets, possibly the only visibly convincing earnings lynchpin for the fund. The fund incurred a goodwill loss of RM1.2 billion for buying the power plants from Malaysian tycoon T Ananda Krishnan and casino group Genting. In other words, it overpaid that much, forking out a total of RM10.85 billion.\n\nWhy should an entity, owned by Malaysia's Ministry of Finance and chaired by Prime Minister Najib Razak, overpay for power plants, whose concessions were awarded by the government? This more so because the government will also determine the future terms of these concessions that are nearing their end. If anything, that should have placed 1MDB in a better bargaining position.\n\nThere was one more big niggling issue, already widely known: 1MDB has placed some US$2.3 billion in funds registered in the Cayman Islands. The names of the fund managers have not been disclosed.\n\nBack to transparency. 1MDB has finally released its accounts and lodged them with the Companies Commission of Malaysia. That is required by law - in this instance, the Companies Act.\n\nFor a sovereign wealth fund like 1MDB, which no doubt also carries political risk not unlike SWFs the world over, transparency needs to transcend meeting minimum standards.\n\nFor one thing, unless one trawls the Companies Commission website and is willing to fork out a small sum of money (RM15 per report) to read the statements, there is no other official source.\n\n1MDB's website does not include its latest financial statement. In fact, unlike most other state-backed funds in Malaysia, the website has no information on its annual financial performance.\n\nWhat the website does have, and glaringly so, are many clarifying statements on media reports - a sure sign of a fund that is on the defensive than one that is pro-active with its disclosure standards.\n\n1MDB's opacity and its latest accounts are stirring much trepidation in the country, particularly among governance hawks. It is time that the strategic investment fund switched its communications strategy.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

First-quarter net profit rose 29 per cent to $899 million from the previous corresponding quarter's $696 million. This translated to earnings per share of 26.2 cents, up from 20.2 cents a year ago. Annualised earnings per share were 104.5 cents, up from 79.1 cents.\n\nThe January-March results beat analysts' estimates of $735 million, a Bloomberg poll showed.\n\nWith the existing \"administrative procedure\", a foreign bank in China can open just roughly two branches and sub-branches a year, said CEO Samuel Tsien at a briefing yesterday to discuss OCBC's results.\n\nBut Wing Hang, as a Hong Kong bank, has an advantage to open branches in certain parts of China, said Mr Tsien. Under the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement, Hong Kong banks can expand much farther in Guangdong province once they set up a subsidiary there.\n\nWing Hang has the bulk of its branch presence in the southern part of China, where Guangdong province - dubbed the factory of the world - is located. By comparison, only one of OCBC's 16 branches in China is in the southern area.\n\nGrowth in loans linked to Greater China significantly outpaced the other markets on a year-on-year comparison with a 74 per cent year-on-year jump to $30 billion, OCBC's first-quarter results yesterday showed.\n\nGreater China loans - categorised on a credit-risk basis - made up 17 per cent of OCBC's customer loan book as at March 31, and is now the second-largest market in loan book terms after Singapore.\n\nFor the first quarter, total income rose 19 per cent to $1.89 billion on higher net interest income and fee income. Net interest income was up 19 per cent at $1.09 billion on the back of stronger loan growth and wider margins.\n\nNet interest margin gained six basis points to 1.7 per cent, given the higher loan spreads across both commercial and corporate loans, Mr Tsien said. Notably, there has been a pick-up in spreads for housing loans, he added. The segment has been hit badly by cooling measures.\n\nNon-interest income increased 18 per cent to $800 million, driven partly by firm performance in the wealth management business. Its non-performing loan ratio stayed at 0.7 per cent.\n\nAddressing questions over risks in China, Mr Tsien said the bank is targeting top Chinese corporations that are venturing abroad, as that plays to OCBC's competitive advantage as an offshore bank. This is key since competition from the Chinese banks will be very strong, he added.\n\nHe said the bank would work with SME clients in China - many of whom are becoming private-banking clients - by attracting them through wealth management products, in addition to offering business loans. \"From a risk perspective, if we can tie in their personal wealth to the business side, it creates comfort,\" he said.\n\nShares of OCBC gained 1.9 per cent yesterday to close at $9.65.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

(The median is the mid-point in a range.)\n\nHowever, for most of the items which were more expensive here than elsewhere, the price premiums did not, generally, exceed 20 per cent.\n\nIn fact, it was found that Singapore was not the most expensive location in most instances.\n\nThe findings of the study commissioned by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) were released yesterday in the MAS April 2014 Macroeconomic Review.\n\nGiven that the analysis centred on only three global brands, the findings should not be taken as representative of differences in the overall cost of living across cities, the Review said. The findings are only a snapshot of how the prices of goods sold here under these three brands compared with those in 10 other major cities in Q2 2013.\n\nPrices here were compared with those in Paris, London, Shanghai, New York, Taipei, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Sydney and Tokyo.\n\nAltogether, 647 items from Apple, Ikea and Zara were included in the study.\n\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit had last month named Singapore as the most expensive city in the world. This had been mainly due to the strong Singapore dollar and the high cost of cars, utilities and clothes.\n\nSome key findings of the MAS-MTI study:\n\nThe Review said: \"It appears that the pricing decisions of these firms are influenced by unit cost and demand for their products in the respective markets.\"\n\nSingapore's small market size appears to explain, to a large extent, the relatively high prices for some goods when compared to the prices of identical items in similarly high-cost cities such as Hong Kong and New York.\n\nRetailers also practise pricing-to-market, which entails assessing the intensity of competition and consumer demand when setting the price; this is a well-documented phenomenon not unique to Singapore. Put simply, some consumers are willing to pay more for an item even if it costs more here than, say, in London, because they want it.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its gross profit margin improved significantly to 21 per cent from 12.6 per cent as a result of higher factory utilisation and continued efforts to streamline internal efficiencies.\n\nThe group's earnings per share improved to 0.31 cent in the third quarter, compared to a loss per share of 0.62 cent in the year-ago quarter.\n\nCash and cash equivalents remained healthy at $22.3 million as at March 31.\n\nAmid a recovering US luxury boat market, regional buying interest, especially here and in Japan, has picked up. From having participated in several boat shows in recent months, the group's net order book grew to $10.6 million as at March 31, up from $9 million at the end of the second quarter.\n\nHeine Askaer-Jensen, chairman of Grand Banks, said: \"As outlined in our strategic roadmap, we want to exit from the SGX watch-list and to chart a dynamic new chapter of growth from the proposed acquisition of Palm Beach and induction of Mark Richards as the chief executive of Grand Banks' enlarged Group with two world-class boat brands.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Using market rates, US gross domestic product was US$16.2 trillion in 2012, compared with China's US$8.2 trillion.\n\nAccording to a Financial Times report yesterday, the figures are the most authoritative estimates of what money can buy in different countries and are used by most public and private sector organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund. This is the first time they have been updated since 2005.\n\nChanges in methodology contributed to the speed of China's rise and India jumping to third-biggest in 2011 from 10th in 2005.\n\nAs economies estimate their GDP at national price levels and in national currencies, it was not possible to compare their GDPs, the ICP report said.\n\n\"To be compared, they must be valued at a common price level and expressed in common currency,\" the ICP said.\n\nPPPs make it possible to compare the GDPs of economies in real terms by removing the price level difference between them, similar to GDP comparisons over time for a single economy, where it is necessary to remove the price changes between the periods being compared in order to assess the changes in the underlying real expenditures, the ICP explained in its report. Purchasing power parity seeks to compare how far money goes in each country.\n\nBased on this new methodology, the ICP concluded that money goes further in poorer countries than it previously thought, prompting it to increase the relative size of emerging market economies such as China's.\n\nThe Financial Times report said that based on IMF projections of China's growth at 24 per cent between 2011 and 2014 and the US economy at 7.4 per cent for the same period, China is likely to overtake the US this year.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/young-design-centric", "site_title": "Young design-centric", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nYoung design-centric\n\nA new generation of Singapore designers dares to go beyond aesthetics to leave an indelible imprint. By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 25, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nGeorge Soo\n\nDESIGNER George Soo believes in \"keeping design real\".\n\nSays Mr Soo, 35: \"I don't believe in design for design's sake. Everything must have purpose and function, from size and dimensions right down to the colour, material, even the buttons. I want the user to feel that the product has been designed with their needs in mind. More often than not, design is so focused on the aesthetic that it becomes 'cold' to the audience.\"\n\nKeeping design real is also the tagline for his design firm, Fliq, which he founded two years ago. Mr Soo recently launched an updated range of his furniture, Next, which was first conceived in 2001 and introduced as a collection in 2005. \"I designed and sold furniture for Xtra then, and created a few pieces in the first range which are still selling today,\" he explains. No new designs have been added to the Next collection since then. In 2012, with an increasing demand for a workspace that inspires creativity and enhances productivity, Mr Soo proposed to the furniture retailer to consider a major refresh of the brand and introduce an updated range of furniture.\n\nThe theme of the revamped range is about working smart, challenging the notion that a workspace environment has to be sterile, straightforward and designed to be task-oriented. \"The Next collection goes beyond furniture's basic purpose of providing a seat, and to offer functional elements to support a smart and dynamic workspace,\" says Mr Soo. The Next collection is sold at Xtra.\n\nWithin the Next collection, Mr Soo is especially proud of his Grover&Jones, a three-seater and a single-seat sofa combination which may be used together or individually to smarten up the workplace. \"Grover promotes interaction by inviting users to lean on the sofa's multifaceted sides for quick discussions, while the single-seat Jones adds a point of interest to any office with its angled shapes,\" says Mr Soo. Grover&Jones won a Singapore Good Design Mark.\n\nMr Soo, who graduated with a diploma in product and industrial design from Temasek Polytechnic and later, a bachelor's in mass communications from RMIT/SIM, does more than just furniture design. \"Fliq offers end-to-end product design and development consultancy services. These include conceptualisation, design, development, packaging and branding,\" he says. He recently completed the interiors for Shinkansen and The Secret Mermaid, a salad bar by day and a bar by night, respectively.\n\nOn the challenges of being a designer in Singapore, Mr Soo says that there needs to be more enterprises and companies to believe that design can pave a new direction for their business and create new possibilities for revenue.\n\n\"Too often designers are given a pure design brief which is just about enhancing the aesthetic. If businesses brought us into the conversation from the start, such as in understanding the business objectives and problems, we would be in a better place to design ways to transform aspects of their business which could have real impact,\" he says.\n\nSpartan use of space\n\nAuradee Sae-Lin\n\nTAIWANESE-THAI student Auradee Sae-Lin, 19, knows a thing or two about designing furniture for small homes. She is, after all, the first-prize winner of the inaugural Ikea Singapore's Young Designer Award this year.\n\nThe Raffles Design Institute student won with her UNI Space Saving Compact Table. The competition was launched as a platform for students to demonstrate their creativity and develop furnishing solutions that were functional, well-designed and aesthetically appealing, based on the theme Make Space Better at home.\n\nMs Sae-Lin noticed that the living rooms in most flats in Singapore tend to lack space. \"For instance, there is no place for large numbers of people during gatherings and no place for people to have daily activities such as doing some yoga,\" says Ms Sae-Lin. So she designed the UNI Compact Table. The table comes in only seven components with no jointed parts, making it easy to assemble. \"It provides flexibility on space usage as it can be stored compactly or extended into a bigger dimension by simply pulling another table underneath and rotating the upper part of the desk,\" Ms Sae-Lin explains. When not in use, it can be easily kept under the sofa. Made from WPC, a sustainable material made of recycled plastic and wood fibre, the table is durable, water and rot-resistant. Ms Sae-Lin says that discovering everyday problems and finding a solution for them are her inspirations for designing.\n\nThe final year student chose to specialise in product design partly because of her family business. She raves about learning professional skills, such as sketching, 2D illustration, 3D computer rendering, and learning how to make prototypes. \"One thing that really makes me feel complete and satisfied is that you bring out your concept idea into the real world,\" she says.\n\nApart from her award-winning UNI table, other products that she has designed include lighting, furniture, electrical products, transportation design, cutlery design, toy, pavilion structure design and hotel buffet and pastry display. Her award includes a trip to Ikea in Sweden, and she will also take up an internship with the company. \"As a young designer, I want to gain more experience and develop skills in design management and learn how to market myself for the future,\" she says.\n\nShe adds that it would be a great achievement if one of her products is manufactured and sold internationally by Ikea. Ms Sae-Lin also has bigger dreams. \"My dream project would be to collaborate with renowned designers such as Philippe Starck and Naoto Fukusawa. I admire their work greatly.\"\n\nCrafting a digital niche\n\nClement Zheng\n\nSOME designers create products the old-school way - sketching either by hand or using a computer, then creating prototypes.\n\nBut not Clement Zheng, who calls himself a \"digital craftsman\", as his works tend to employ algorithms or digital fabrication. But he is quick to add that, as an industrial designer, he is always very grounded in physical processes and efficiency.\n\n\"I would say that I am an extremely logical designer, and it is not just for the problem-solving aspects of the project, but also in communication and design expression as well,\" he says.\n\nNow a teaching assistant at NUS, Mr Zheng, 27, graduated from the division of industrial design, with first-class honours in his Bachelor of Arts (Industrial Design) two years ago. While being a teaching assistant at NUS is his full-time job, he also creates his own projects on the side.\n\n\"As a designer, I find the dichotomy between the digital and physical a rich area to explore. What I hope to achieve as a designer is to develop projects that are both digitally and physically relevant; that is, to create holistic experiences that can really make use of the best of both worlds,\" he says of his career choice.\n\nHis focus is on digital design, not just for products, but also looking at services and experiences. \"Most of my works thus far are from my design research on the intersection between craft and computer,\" he explains.\n\nMr Zheng is the top winner at this year's Furniture Design Awards, an annual competition organised by the Singapore Furniture Industries Council that celebrates the best achievements in furniture design.\n\nHis winning creation is the Torus Lamp, a series of digitally fabricated pendant lights assembled from paper modules. Mr Zheng developed a set of algorithms that are able to deconstruct three-dimensional geometry into flat modules.\n\nThrough a computer application, a person can customise the size and form of the lamp to suit different contexts. The application then generates the flat modules required to assemble the lamp. The lamps are very material efficient, each one requiring a single A1 sheet to produce, while the specialised joints designed ensure that minimal accessories are required to put the lamp together.\n\n\"In this sense, Torus Lamp is a design that can exist within a small community, where the design, fabrication, and distribution can all be kept very localised,\" he says.\n\n3D printing is another area that he is interested in for \"its strength in producing geometrically complex objects in a made-to-order manner.\"\n\nHis 3D printing creations include Fusili, a springy bracelet generated from a mathematical algorithm that he designed. By changing the algorithm, different variations of the bracelet can be created. The chosen variant can then be 3D printed into a bracelet and even be dyed in different colours.\n\nMr Zheng is now exploring the idea of mass customisation, such as developing an algorithm that is able to digitally tailor fashion, in such a way that clothes will fit anyone, rather than the buyer trying to fit into fixed silhouettes. \"With this algorithm, hopefully fashion houses would be able to develop services that can produce tailored garments, yet within the efficiency of digital fabrication techniques,\" says Mr Zheng.\n\nMosaic STL is another project that he is working on, which again involves algorithms, to transform a 3D file into a colourful sculpture, achieving an uncanny mosaic tiling through digital means rather than the traditional craft.\n\nHis dream project, however, goes beyond merely creating objects. \"A project that I would love to do right now would be one that encompasses another discipline or field, such as a medical project, or maybe even something educational for children,\" he says. \"I think crossing disciplines would really bring in fresh ideas and not cause me to stagnate.\"\n\nChallenging design archetypes\n\nOlivia Lee\n\nIT wouldn't be wrong to say that Olivia Lee has a successful career as a designer in the six short years since her graduation from Central Saint Martins. Mathmos, the British company responsible for the iconic lava lamp, invited her to design a limited-edition graphic plate for their projector lights. The \"Microcosmic\" edition sold out fairly quickly.\n\nFresh out of college, Ms Lee was invited by UK's Icon Magazine to be their featured guest illustrator, where she was conferred the honoured last page of the magazine to depict monthly illustrations that were the design industry's equivalent of political cartoons.\n\nAnd LVMH-Glenmorangie handpicked her to participate in a workshop on the Art of Luxury at LVMH House (London), where she created new whisky bottle concepts for the spirit brand, based on glaciers.\n\nMs Lee, 29, has her father to thank for guiding her in the right direction. She recalls how as a child, she wanted to be many things: scientist, inventor, artist, architect, poet, graphic-novelist, philosopher, illustrator and entrepreneur. \"I was pretty lost when it came to deciding on a profession that would satisfy all my interests,\" she says. Her father suggested she check out an industrial design course since it is a blend of creative, engineering and business practices. \"To me, design is not just a career. It is a way of understanding and interpreting the world in insightful and novel ways. It is expression, criticism, communication, problem-solving, harmonisation and innovation,\" she says. \"Design is just one of many terms that can be used to describe these ideals.\"\n\nShe graduated from Central Saint Martins College of Art & Design, with an honours in product design in 2008.\n\nMs Lee recently started her own studio, where she sees herself as an independent designer with a model of collaboration that changes all the time. \"I like to think that I operate independent of disciplines, instead following projects and people who resonate with me,\" she says. \"It is liberating to meet clients who appreciate this philosophy. Trust goes a long way when you are dealing with the capricious nature of creative work.\"\n\nIn Singapore, her works include Float, a coffee table that appears as a levitating lotus pond supported by a trio of intertwining stems. Each table is unique, containing an arrangement of lotus leaves sourced from South-east Asia. A cup of tea placed on the table appears to float on water. Another product is the Revere Vase, a shallow bowl-like vase with a rounded base. \"I wanted to explore the concept of stability and to challenge the archetype of a vessel needing a flat base,\" she says.\n\nBoth Float and Revere Vase were designed for Industry+, a brand new contemporary Asian furniture label that was launched in March 2014. She was also among 30 designers who designed a public installation using unwanted logs from parks in Singapore. Her piece, titled Struck, features a mirror surface on the bench, signifying a tree struck by lightning.\n\nLast year, she designed a National Day Tote Bag for the National Heritage Board, which featured an artwork that referenced the traditional Chinese almanac wall calendar. \"Designed specifically as a souvenir, locals are able to relate to the patriotic and nostalgic meaning behind the print while visitors can appreciate the historical significance of National Day,\" she explains.\n\nShe is tight-lipped about her current projects, but would only say that she may be working on one for next year's Milan Design Week. \"I cannot tell you any more than that, except that I am super-excited,\" she quips.\n\nOn her design style, she says there is none. \"There is no intentional style to my work. I follow my instincts and let the work describe itself. Observers tend to describe my work as poetic, soulful, light and dream-like. I don't mind those descriptions at all.\"\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nTaySuanChiangBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Miami-based Royal Caribbean and Mr Braman, 81, a civic activist who has opposed publicly financed stadiums, welcome Mr Beckham's team. They just want it to steer clear of the world's largest cruise-ship hub.\n\nA decision on the land by Miami-Dade County commissioners and Mayor Carlos Gimenez will help determine how much revenue the port has to pay down debt that will exceed a record US$1 billion after a scheduled tax-exempt bond sale next week.\n\n\"While it sat empty for years, that land's suddenly become very precious,\" said Jack McCabe, a real estate consultant in nearby Deerfield Beach. \"It's amazing what celebrity interest will do.\"\n\nMiami is borrowing to help its port - a man-made island in Biscayne Bay that is shaped like a cruise ship - prepare for the widening of the Panama Canal. The municipality wants to compete with other US cities to attract larger ships after an expansion to the canal that is scheduled to be finished by 2016.\n\nThe stand-off risks raising the county's borrowing costs for the port as officials predict that the facility's revenue will rise enough to pay off a mounting debt burden.\n\n\"There are these high hopes, and what if they don't come to fruition?\" said Justin Land, who helps manage US$3 billion of municipal bonds at Naples, Florida-based Wasmer, Schroeder & Co.\n\n\"With the yields as low as they are today in general, I just can't imagine it will price at a level where we would be compensated for all the future unknowns,\" said Mr Land, whose firm is avoiding the seaport's debt. Benchmark muni yields are close to 10-month lows.\n\nRevenue from cruise and cargo operations fell short of promised levels last year, and Moody's Investors Service said in August that the port was not bringing in enough money to cover future debt service.\n\nInvestors have demanded about 1.5 percentage points of extra yield this year on average to buy Miami-Dade County seaport bonds maturing in October 2029 instead of benchmark debt, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That is almost double the average spread on revenue debt graded one step higher.\n\nMiami-Dade issued US$383 million of debt in September that PortMiami used to fund a US$2 billion renovation scheduled for completion next year. Those funds, along with next week's debt, will go towards deepening water and building a tunnel facilitating truck access to nearby highways.\n\nThe county, which owns the port, plans to sell US$206 million in tax-exempt revenue bonds on May 6 that will be repaid with port proceeds, said Frank Hinton, director of bond administration for Miami-Dade. The sale will put debt above US$1.1 billion, pushing the port to seek new revenue. The total includes about US$696 million in direct port debt and about US$454 million in loans and bonds that Miami-Dade has issued on PortMiami's behalf.\n\nMLS in February awarded Mr Beckham a Miami expansion team that will play its first season in 2016. The former English captain played six seasons with MLS' Los Angeles Galaxy and retired from the sport last year.\n\nBefore he proposed the stadium last year, officials at the downtown port crafted a plan calling for the land to be used for offices, hotels and retail.\n\nA soccer team that will pay rent to the county for the land is a better option, said John Alschuler, chairman of HR&A Advisors, who is working with Mr Beckham on the stadium. That money can help the port repay its bonds, he said.\n\n\"We're the only idea out there ready to come tomorrow, pay market rent and help the port meet its debts,\" he said.\n\nSimon Oliveira, a Beckham spokesman in London, did not respond to requests for comment on the stadium.\n\nAs Royal Caribbean and Mr Braman lobby against them, Mr Alschuler and Mr Beckham are negotiating with the mayor and commissioners, who will decide whether to approve a 25,000-seat stadium on the county-owned land. The team is not seeking tax dollars from the county for the stadium, Mr Alschuler said.\n\n\"This is the only port we have, and we think it's real estate that ought to be preserved for port-related purposes,\" said Rob Zeiger, a spokesman for Royal Caribbean. \"We don't see how trying to bring 30,000 people into this area on a regular basis can do anything but create traffic problems.\"\n\nRoyal Caribbean supports a Miami team, just not at the port, Mr Zeiger said. Mr Braman and other critics echoed that view.\n\nMayor Gimenez has signalled that he is open to a stadium at the site. Commissioners have raised concern over traffic and costs.\n\nPort improvements in Miami, Baltimore and other cities will accommodate cargo ships carrying the equivalent of 13,000 20-foot containers via the Panama Canal. That is more than twice the capacity of current ships passing through the canal.\n\nSixty-three of 82 ports surveyed by the American Association of Port Authorities planned to invest US$46 billion on infrastructure from 2012 till 2016, according to Randy Gerardes, an analyst with Wells Fargo Securities. That compares with a combined US$30.1 billion spent from 1946 till 2005.

Swiss-Asia Financial signed up 20 managers seeking to start their own funds in the past nine months, while the number of new funds set up more than doubled to seven last year at Gordian Capital Singapore Pte, according to the companies.\n\n\"If you have less than US$40 million in assets under management and you are launching a fund aimed at global investors, it has become much more difficult,\" said Mark Voumard, chief executive officer of Gordian Capital. A platform \"that allows managers to focus on their skill set is both a cost-effective and efficient option\".\n\nAsia-based hedge funds oversaw a combined US$79.7 billion as at March, having recovered by 41 per cent from the April 2009 trough, according to Eurekahedge Pte. In Singapore, 288 fund-management companies had US$15.3 billion of assets under management as at March, compared with US$25.2 billion managed by 447 firms in Hong Kong, the Singapore-based data provider said.\n\n\"The investor network that platforms can offer should also be viewed as a key driver to joining a platform,\" said Omar Taheri, business development manager at Swiss-Asia Financial. \"After all, raising capital is still one of the most difficult tasks when you start a hedge fund.\"\n\nThe tighter regulations introduced by the MAS in 2012 mainly affected smaller entities that were previously known as exempt fund managers.\n\nUnder the previous rules, companies seeking to start under the exempt status were \"encouraged\" to have at least two professionals with a minimum of five years of experience, according to Singapore-based law firm Colin Ng & Partners LLP. They weren't subject to audit requirements, business conduct rules or restrictions on assets under management. The only relevant rules were that they weren't allowed to have more than 30 qualified investors as clients.\n\nUnder the tightened regulations, registered fund management companies must have at least two relevant professionals with a certain level of experience. In addition, they aren't allowed to manage more than S$250 million or have more than 30 qualified investors as clients, as opposed to licensed fund managers, who have no such restrictions.\n\nRegistered managers also have to meet certain capital requirements, need to implement a compliance and risk management framework and are subject to tighter reporting, accounting and auditing requirements, according to the regulator.\n\nThe city-state had about 540 exempt fund managers under the old rules, an estimate by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP showed. About 200 of the exempt-status managers chose to become registered, while about 190 of them obtained a fund-manager licence with higher requirements and unlimited assets under management, it said.\n\nAbout 90 fund managers who were exempt shut down, joined other companies such as family offices or signed up with a platform, while the remaining 60 have applied either for a licence or to become a registered fund manager, according to the consulting firm.\n\n\"For 80 per cent of the exempt fund managers the change in regulation made no difference,\" said Peter Douglas, principal of Singapore-based research firm GFIA Pte. \"For 20 per cent it was terminal.\"\n\nNot all newer fund managers are linking up with partners providing non-investment services. Integral Capital Pte started a long-only fund in 2011 under the old regime and chose to become a registered fund manager when the new rules were introduced, even with the higher costs, said Talib Dohadwala, a founding partner at the Singapore-based company.\n\nThe stricter regulations mandate an audited financial statement as well as a risk management audit, both done by an external firm that could cost more than S$15,000, according to Mr Dohadwala.\n\n\"We wanted to be independent and run our business autonomously,\" said Mr Dohadwala. \"We felt from the beginning that we could meet the requirements under the new regime.\"\n\nThe new regulations are making Singapore a more sustainable and robust environment for fund managers, according to Bill Jamieson, a partner at Colin Ng & Partners.\n\n\"I don't think those regulations are overkill,\" Mr Jamieson said. \"Singapore, being a proper financial market, needs proper regulation.\"\n\nMr Bansal found a cost-effective solution by joining Swiss-Asia Financial.\n\n\"If you do it exactly by the book and set up a registered office with the amount of space that is required as for the regulations and employees it would easily cost between S$250,000 and S$300,000 per year,\" Mr Bansal said. \"By setting up business with the platform, I save more than half of that amount.\"\n\nFive out of 20 that have signed up with Swiss-Asia Financial are either already in business or about to start, chief operating officer Steve Knabl said in Singapore. That compares with one fund a year starting in previous years, he said, adding that the company has seen a \"dramatic increase of interest\".\n\n\"The challenge we are having is some fund managers are not willing to pay our platform fees,\" said Mr Taheri, adding that managers should realise they can save money going with a platform rather than setting up on their own.\n\nRoshan Padamadan also started the Luminance Global Fund, which invests in liquid securities including stocks, bonds and derivatives, in January with Swiss-Asia Financial. He chose to start through the company because it allows him to focus on his investments.\n\n\"If you run your own hedge fund, you have to devote about half of your time and energy to administration and organisation,\" said Mr Padamadan, who started with initial capital of about US$1 million and now manages US$1.55 million. \"Working on a platform, you can spend much more time on the actual investment process. I prefer to keep my head clear for that.\"\n\nAnil Ponnampalam, manager of the Archimedean Point Fund, said that investing under a licensed company helps dispel investors' concerns that a new fund's operations may not be robust. Mr Ponnampalam started his Asia-focused long-short equity fund with Gordian Capital this month, he said.\n\n\"It's about mitigating the business and operational risks to allow me to focus on the performance as an investment manager,\" Mr Ponnampalam said. \"I owe that to every investor in my fund.\"\n\nGordian Capital, which typically attracted three new funds on average annually, saw the number grow to seven new funds in 2013, Mr Voumard said. Two have already started this year and two more will begin soon, he said. Inquiries have also doubled to about 100 managers seeking to start in the past 12 months, he said.\n\n\"If you either have a small asset size or no interest in building an organisation, then some kind of a platform deal is very sensible,\" Mr Douglas said.

In what is known as mitigation banking, New Forests restores and manages habitats (or mitigation banks) such as wetlands, and sells credits associated with the environmental benefits of such an asset.\n\nNew Forests manages A$2.3 billion (S$2.7 billion) in assets and over 450,000 hectares of land and forests in Asia, Australia and the US. Its US$50 million Eco Products Fund, which is jointly managed with Equator Environmental, invests in mitigation banking.\n\n\"This is a very big business for us in the US,\" said Mr Brand, who sees demand for this taking off here in the next one to two years.\n\n\"We've been talking to (palm oil players) for three to four years now,\" he said, adding that these companies are now waiting to see what the final RSPO rules are before committing to such projects.\n\nThe fund manager has already started a biodiversity bank with the state government in Sabah, selling conservation certificates to individuals and companies which help to sustain the reserves.\n\nBesides the restoration of forests, palm oil players say the next natural step for the industry to take towards sustainability is to build large-scale segregated supply chains for certified and non-certified palm oil.\n\nCurrently, even if plantations produce certified palm oil, it gets mixed in with the rest. Some firms such as Golden Agri-Resources, however, segregate certified palm oil for specific buyers who pay a premium.\n\nBut just as the recent change in Wilmar's policy had been many years in the making, patience will be needed for further progress.\n\n\"Change is not easy for many people. It will take some time,\" said RSPO secretary-general Darrel Webber. The industry will move towards it only if there is demand, he added. \"I always tell people you cannot push the supply chain, you can only pull it.\"\n\nAnd with many large companies having committed to use only certified palm oil by 2015, Mr Webber sees the 2014/2015 marketing year as a \"phenomenal\" milestone for the industry.\n\n\"You just combine these, plus the commitment by some countries, and there will be more demand coming from the US, Australia or New Zealand - there will be enough of a pull.\"\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The talents of the women in our population should be appreciated on their own merit.\"\n\nSet up in 2012 under his ministry to look into gender diversity on boards, the DTF found that women comprised only 8.3 per cent of board directors in Singapore-listed companies, and that 57 per cent of company boards were all-male bastions.\n\nYesterday, the DTF presented its recommendations on tackling this issue.\n\nA Diversity Action Committee (DAC) that will put the recommendations into practice will be chaired by Singapore Exchange (SGX) CEO Magnus Bocker; Speaker of Parliament Halimah Yacob, who initiated this project when she was minister of state for the ministry, is its adviser.\n\nThe committee will work with stakeholders such as the government, the regulators, companies and their boards and members of academia to lift the level of female representation on boards.\n\nThe DTF has recommended, for example, that:\n\nMildred Tan, managing director of Ernst & Young Advisory and chairwoman of the DTF, expressed the hope that 1,000 women would be trained and board- ready by 2020 - meaning they would occupy a fifth of all directorships.\n\nMr Chan said the less prescriptive approach may seem a harder route to take than the legislative or quota route, but that the quota route would be counter-productive in the long term.\n\n\"If there is no real appreciation for the talent and what our womenfolk can bring to the table on their own merit, then I think we have failed them. I don't think our women need (prescriptive) kinds of action to affirm what they are capable of,\" he added.\n\nYeo Lian Sim, special adviser at SGX and a member of the DTF, took that thought further: \"If we start with quotas, it might be all too easy (for companies) to just meet the numbers without actually addressing the issue - which is to have a representation on the board that's good for the company.\"\n\nAsked why the DTF focused on gender diversity on boards instead of all types of diversity, Ms Tan said it wanted to start with a focus on this particular area first, so that the results would be tangible, and the recommendations concrete.\n\nMr Bocker said of the good that had come out of the DTF's work on a complex issue: \"I think the DTF has created some simplicity to all this complexity by coming up with real, hands-on things that we can do.\"\n\nPenelope Phoon, executive director of the Singapore Institute of Directors (SID) - the national association of company directors - said, in response to the findings: \"Board diversity is important and, while board diversity is more than gender diversity, the latter deserves focus because it is a problem.\"\n\nShe disclosed that SID had formed a Diversity Sub-Committee which will review the DTF's recommendations and the broader issue of diversity in the boardroom, and determine actions that SID and its partners can take.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

When you're in the business of setting trends, the pressure is on to discover the next It locale for an epic soiree. By May Yip\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 25, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nFOR consummate girls about town, the coolest venues to tag on your Instagram photo map aren't the latest clubs or restaurants. Instead, decommissioned sites, restored warehouses and even schools are go-to spots to see and be seen, as they take turns being venues du jour for the hottest fashion parties.\n\nBut just as how the season's reigning trend appears on just about every other runway, the brands that try so hard to rise above the hoi polloi end up clamouring for the same event hotspots. And the location of the moment seems to be the Old Kallang Airport, where Calvin Klein recently hosted the likes of actors Zhang Ziyi, Louis Koo and Dakota Johnson, and DJs Leigh Lezark and Geordon Nicol, in an architectural installation, designed to serve as a \"concept house\" for the brand a fortnight ago.\n\nThis Tuesday, luxury French fashion house Hermes is set to unveil an event at the former aviation gateway, where over 500 guests can discover the full range of the brand's men's collections through installations and performances imagined by Argentinian artist Leandro Erlich, French digital artist Miguel Chevalier, as well as site-specific works inspired directly by the Old Kallang Airport.\n\n\"In 2010, we first saw the Kallang Airport during a location scouting trip and loved it,\" reveals Malcolm Carfrae, executive vice-president and chief communications officer for Calvin Klein Inc. \"Ultimately, we opted to use an abandoned prison for that event, but when we started our discussions for this one, the hangar seemed a natural fit - especially since no other branded event had ever been held there.\"\n\nThe company showcased its ck Calvin Klein Spring 2010 collection at the old Queenstown Remand Prison just weeks before it was demolished. While the brand managed to be the first and last to hold an event at the site, regular fashion party attendees often find themselves returning to the same venues for different events, often within a short time span.\n\n\"Perhaps if the brands are positioned very differently, they don't see it as competition or copying,\" says founder of public relations and events company Mercury Marketing & Communications Tjin Lee, when asked why different companies would want to hold events at venues used by other brands. \"For example, both Fred Perry and Hermes have used the Tanjong Pagar Railway Station, but they create totally different experiences for the guests.\"\n\nIn the past, 72-13, a former rice warehouse on Mohamed Sultan Road that is home to performance group Theatreworks, has been used as a space for brands as diverse as Uniqlo and DKNY. Chanel also presented its Cruise 2013 collection at Loewen Cluster six years after Dries Van Noten showed his Spring/Summer 2008 collection there; while the industrial aesthetics of Wheeler's Yard on Jalan Ampas has attracted the likes of Burberry for its raw, underground vibe to launch its Burberry Brit Rhythm fragrance. But fresh locations aren't the only differentiating factors for stylish soirees. With a limited number of venues, industry players tend to bank on novel concepts instead of brand-new locales to intrigue party guests.\n\n\"For example, in Paris, there have been tonnes of shows held at the Grand Palais,\" says Douglas Khee, creative director of event planning and creative agency Division Communications. \"But brands still hold their events there, each time with a crazier idea. It's more about the venue being a good space for pushing the creative envelope.\"\n\nMost notably, fashion behemoth Chanel holds all its Paris Fashion Week presentations at the cavernous, historical site built for the World Fair of 1900. Its creative director Karl Lagerfeld transforms the Beaux-Arts-style building into various sets for his collections, such as a fake art gallery for Spring/Summer 2014 and, most recently, a supermarket packed with Chanel-branded products for Fall/Winter 2014.\n\n\"Venues that are clean spaces, such as warehouses, old galleries and old schools, are very popular. They have the advantage of large, open spaces,\" says Ms Lee. \"Venues with heritage, like the National Art Gallery, old Clifford Pier and the Singapore Museum, are also very desirable when they first open. Brands compete to be the first to host an event in these coveted venues, to impress and draw their guests.\"\n\nIn some cases, high-profile events serve as litmus tests for a location's hip quotient, and even trigger bouts of gentrification. Hermes, for example, has a track record of discovering otherwise unglamorous venues that have gone on to become trendy destinations.\n\n\"The first event was in 2006 for the launch of our Cheval d'Orient tableware collection. At that time, we were looking for a standalone, intimate dining space with a high ceiling that could fit a long table of 30, but nothing seemed to fit our bill,\" recalls Madeleine Ho, marketing and communications director of Hermes Singapore.\n\nMs Ho and her team chanced upon the former Bukit Timah fire station while driving around during a location scout, and decided that it would make an ideal venue, given that it boasts dimensions spacious enough to fit large fire trucks. That same year, as part of the inaugural Singapore Biennale, Hermes hosted a party at the former Tanglin Camp at Dempsey. This was also before Dempsey's barracks were converted into restaurants and galleries, so it served as an unpredictable yet fascinating venue for delegates from Singapore and abroad. Today, the old fire station houses the second outlet of Spruce restaurant, while the Dempsey neighbourhood continues to be a bustling dining destination.\n\nIn an industry that capitalises almost entirely on creating the most au courant image, every palette, silhouette and even typeface conveys a certain brand identity. And wowing the public with an unexpected spectacle is just another tool in a lexicon of luxury signifiers.\n\nAs Mr Carfrae adds: \"Our brands are known around the world for their unique and cutting-edge aesthetic, and our events need to capture that same unexpected, one-of-a-kind appeal.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was primarily due to a lack of recognition of revenue for development projects as there were no new sales in the quarter and all units previously sold had been fully recognised at the end of last year, the property developer said yesterday.\n\nIn addition, the group reported a gain of $47 million on the sale of an available-for-sale investment in the first quarter of last year.\n\nChua Thian Poh, chairman and chief executive officer of the group, cautioned that the residential property market in Singapore still faced strong challenges. In line with the group's strategy, the group acquired another commercial building in London, 1 St Martin's Le Grand, in March.\n\nTogether with Rose Court in London and The Metropolis in Singapore, rental income of the three commercial properties is expected to contribute significantly to the group's earnings for the next few years.\n\nRental income from all of the group's industrial and commercial properties rose from $2.7 million in the first quarter of last year to $15.9 million. This was mainly contributed by the rentals of The Metropolis and Rose Court.\n\nRental income from the group's commercial and industrial properties accounted for 93 per cent of total turnover. The remaining 7 per cent was contributed by rentals of residential properties.\n\nFor the period under review, earnings per share were 0.6 cent, down sharply from 7.7 cents a year ago. Net asset value (NAV) per share at the group level was $3.47 as at end-March, versus $3.48 as at end-December.\n\nHo Bee ended eight cents lower at $2.32 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Excluding one-off gains though, its first-quarter underlying profitability was flat, compared to the previous year.\n\nBut analysts still found this result positive.\n\nJon Windham from Barclays Research said that even though operating income for the quarter was flat, it was a positive incremental change from its performance in 2013, when operating profit declined 10 per cent year-on-year.\n\n\"A good result, in our view, given HPH Trust's history of declining operating profit since its 2011 IPO ... We expect 2014 to be a turnaround year for HPH Trust.\"\n\nBarclays said a key factor is HPH Trust's settlement with third-party contract workers in Hong Kong; under this, it agreed to a more than 6 per cent increase in salaries, in line with the pay increase granted to its direct employees.\n\nMr Windham wrote: \"We expect a more stable labour situation to drive better container volume growth in 2014, as container shipping liners re-establish some service lines through the port of Hong Kong.\"\n\nBarclays maintained its \"overweight\" rating on the HPH Trust stock, with a price target of US$0.76.\n\nOCBC Investment Research, noting the uptrend for outbound cargo to the US and the EU, said this would be a major factor determining the total container volume handled by HPH Trust.\n\nHowever, it pointed out the risks on the horizon. Lead analyst Eli Lee wrote: \"We continue to see upward pressure in terms of cost of services rendered, which increased 11 per cent year-on-year due to higher external contractor costs and inflationary pressures.\n\n\"Capex (capital expenditure) in the first quarter of 2014 also rose 27 per cent year-on-year to HK$311 million (S$50.4 million), and management indicates that it would revive expansion plans to add one berth each year at Yantian from 2015.\"\n\nDespite these factors, OCBC expects the downside to be limited; it pointed to the attractive 2014 dividend yield of 8.1 per cent, prompting it to maintain a \"hold\" rating on the stock while slightly increasing its fair-value estimate to US$0.68 from US$0.63 previously.\n\nHPH Trust said yesterday that investors can look forward to continued attractive dividends. Its spokesman told The Business Times: \"The trust's objective is to provide stable and growing annual distributions to unitholders, consistent with the outlook for the trust's business. It was set up at the time of the IPO and we do not see the need to amend the dividend policy.\"\n\nBesides this, the trust said it will continue to focus on operating fundamentals such as managing its cash flow through appropriate financing arrangements, managing capex spending and controlling working capital needs, so as to ensure that the stock is fairly valued.\n\n\"By continuously achieving those objectives, we are hopeful such accomplishments will be appropriately reflected in the unit price as investors (both existing and potential) express their confidence in the long-term stability of our ports and operations.\"\n\nThe trust closed trading yesterday up half a cent at US$0.68.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But while some companies can pass on higher costs to customers, others - especially those in the logistics, shipping and construction industries - may not be able to sustain margins that way.\n\nIn its twice-yearly Macroeconomic Review, the central bank said that firms in these segments could see tougher days ahead. Whether because of overcapacity or keen competition, such companies may find it difficult to command higher product prices, which would otherwise help to offset rising costs.\n\nMargins of firms in these industries have seen a steady slide in recent years - as at the end of 2013, profit margins of listed companies in these sectors were less than half the figures in early 2010.\n\nAt the same time, the impact of continued margin pressures will be uneven. Firms with a greater reliance on manpower - including those in accommodation & food services, recreational, community & personal services, and the construction sector - will feel the effects more acutely.\n\nOCBC economist Selena Ling told The Business Times: \"The writing is on the wall. The government has been trying to tell companies, especially SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises), that you either shape up or ship out. Basically, if margins are being squeezed because costs are rising, and you have no way of passing them on and are not in a position to adopt manpower-saving technologies, it's a bit of a double whammy.\"\n\nWage pressures will only intensify over the rest of this year, as strong hiring intentions continue to butt up against a tight labour market, said the MAS.\n\nWith productivity growth likely to provide only a modest offset to this, Singapore's unit labour cost (ULC) is expected to rise by another 3 per cent in 2014. The ULC rise moderated from 5.2 per cent in 2012 to 3.1 per cent in 2013.\n\nCoupled with the hikes in foreign worker levies, ULC - and therefore the pass-through of costs to consumers - is expected to rise further in the near term.\n\nHowever, it noted that cost pass-through would be even stronger if not for government measures which have helped to offset firms' operating and development expenditures. These include the Wage Credit Scheme, the Productivity & Innovation Credit scheme and other cash grants and tax rebates offered to companies here.\n\nBased on its simulations, the MAS estimates that these fiscal measures collectively lowered the headline inflation rate by by 0.05 per cent in 2011-2012, and 0.13 per cent in 2013. \"The restraining effect in 2014-2016 is estimated to be slightly larger than that in 2013, given the enhancement to these assistance schemes in the recent Budget,\" it said.\n\nWith broad-based price rises on the horizon, the MAS reiterated that underlying inflation will remain firm, with sequential core price increases - which strip out accommodation and private road transport costs - staying slightly above its historical average.\n\nOn a year-ago basis, core inflation could rise to around 2.5 per cent in the second half of this year. Headline inflation is expected to be \"volatile\" year on year - after averaging one per cent in Q1 this year, it could surge to 2.5-3 per cent in Q2 (due to the exceptionally low base a year ago, when certificate of entitlement premiums corrected), before easing to below 2 per cent in Q4. MAS also said that employment gains will be more moderate this year, given the record-high labour force participation rate of 66.7 per cent in 2013.\n\n\"With the expected slowdown in the increase in the resident employment rate and the continued tightening of foreign worker inflows, growth of the Singapore economy will increasingly have to be met by productivity gains,\" it added.\n\nStill, even as domestic restructuring efforts weigh on economic expansion, it maintained its 2014 gross domestic product growth forecast of a \"modest\" 2-4 per cent, citing improvements in the global economy which are expected to provide some lift here.\n\n\"Together with a mild turnaround in the global IT industry, (improving conditions in the US, Europe, and Japan) should provide some support for the domestic electronics industry as well as trade-related services.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The agreement announced yesterday will allow the company to begin construction on the last office building on the site, which it will fund entirely with existing capital, it said yesterday, without providing further details.\n\n\"Lend Lease's current balance sheet position provides the group with capacity\" to fund the tower itself, Anthony Passe-de Silva, a Sydney-based analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co, who has an \"overweight\" rating on the stock, wrote in a client note yesterday.\n\n\"Lend Lease is progressing development of Tower 1 sooner than it did with Towers 2 and 3 in light of the lower level of tenancy secured. This presents risks for Lend Lease in terms of filling the remaining space in the three towers.\"\n\nLend Lease in 2012 said it had secured A$1 billion from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, A$500 million from the developer's unlisted fund and pension funds Telstra Super and First State Super. Tenants including Westpac Banking Corp, KPMG LLP, law firm Gilbert+Tobin and Lend Lease itself have leased 77 per cent of the first two towers, according to the Barangaroo South website.\n\n\"This is a long roll-out situation, but it adds to the positive impact that Barangaroo is going to have on Lend Lease,\" Winston Sammut, managing director of Sydney-based Maxim Asset Management, said by telephone.

He also called on all Singaporeans to give them their full support.\n\n\"These changes (to the Cabinet) are part of my government's continuing leadership renewal efforts.

According to the Asia Pacific Real Estate Association, REITs have outperformed the equity and bond markets as an asset class.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2013, Asian REITs returned 8.2 per cent per annum (measured on the TR/GPR/APREA Composite REIT Index) against a lower equity return of 3.8 per cent (MSCI Asia Equities Index) and even lower bond returns of 2.4 per cent (JPM Government Bond Index). Over a longer 10-year period, Asian REITs also registered higher annual returns of 8.8 per cent compared to 7.6 per cent for equities and 6.3 per cent for bonds.\n\nIn Singapore, S-REITs chalked up a total of 13.7 per cent (FTSE ST REIT Index) against the 7.2 per cent for equities (Straits Times Index) for the same three year period.\n\nNotwithstanding the outperformance, there are rumblings on the governance of REITs. To understand why, a short explanation of the unique structure of REITs is in order. Unlike most listed companies, S-REITs are structured as trusts. The assets of a REIT are held by an independent trustee as the legal owner on behalf of unit holders. The trustee is responsible for appointing and overseeing an external REIT manager to manage the assets.\n\nThe REIT manager is a separate company, typically compensated with a base fee according to the value of the properties, a performance fee based on gross revenue and/or net property income, and an acquisition/\n\ndivestment fee based on the value of the assets. The REIT manager is usually majority-owned or wholly-owned by the sponsor - the property developer or owner of the properties that sold its assets to the REIT in the very first place. This relationship between the REIT manager and the sponsor cuts two ways.\n\nCritics argue that REIT managers have more of an incentive to grow the REIT to increase assets under management and hence the overall level of management fees rather than manage the REIT to maximise unit holder value. They cite governance concerns such as the frequent related party transactions, non-mandatory annual general meetings, lack of transparency on the REIT manager's compensation, and the difficulty of removing a non-performing manager.\n\nThe counter argument has been that the sponsor owns a significant proportion of the units and hence its interest is aligned with that of the other unit holders. Indeed, many REITs depend upon their sponsors to continually inject properties to grow the REIT (even if the acquisition/divestment price of the properties may be questioned).\n\nProponents argue that there are also other safeguards. For example, one third of the directors of the REIT is required to be independent (or half when the chairman is not independent). As a matter of common practice among the REITs, independent financial advisory opinions are generally sought and communicated, and financial transactions and decisions are made based on a yield accretive approach.\n\nLooking back\n\nSo, is the outperformance of REITs the result of - or in spite of - the current governance structure? Is the intertwining of sponsors and REIT managers healthy? Or has it just been the REIT industry having tax breaks and being on the right side of the real estate cycle of the last few years?\n\nREITs are relatively young in Singapore. The first S-REIT, CapitalMall Trust, was launched in 2002. A look at the more mature US REIT market might provide an idea of how it could evolve here.\n\nIn 1960, the US Congress passed legislation giving REITs tax treatment similar to mutual funds. The early US REITs had a similar structure of external managers - and similar issues - as to what we have today in Singapore. In 1986, legislation was introduced for US REITs to be internally managed and some of the issues of conflict of interest went away. Internally managed REITs have their own officers and employees managing the portfolio of assets.\n\nKimco Realty, the first internally managed US REIT launched in 1991, became the forerunner for the dominant structure in the US REIT market. In the years since, the US REIT market has grown, consolidated, evolved and matured. Studies of US REITs have found that the percentage of externally managed REITs fell over the years. Today, while a US REIT can choose whether to be internally or externally managed, almost all have chosen the internal option.\n\nMoving forward\n\nSingapore's REIT market will no doubt evolve. With increasing institutional investor interest, coupled with S-REITs looking internationally for growth, the market will mature, consolidate, and eventually adapt to global capital standards.\n\nYet, I wonder whether we can fast-track the process that took the US 26 years? Is it possible for a REIT to adopt a company structure under the Companies Act but continue to enjoy tax exempt status as long as it complies with the present technical requirements for tax pass-through? In a company structure, the REIT will be governed by its own board and the incentive structure of the internal manager will be better aligned with the interest of unit holders.\n\nClearly, this streamlining would need to be a multi-agency effort.

It will also issue a $50 million bond - fully secured by assets including land use rights of the steel business - with a 5 per cent coupon rate a year that Propitious will redeem for cash over the next six months.\n\nThe new businesses in store for Sapphire, previously known as IRE Corp until the mid-2000s, are being evaluated and could involve assets in the infrastructure business and more specifically, road transportation in China, said Mr Teh.\n\n\"Our target is to complete the sale of the steel business and embark on our new business within the next six months. We can't allow the cash to sit for too long,\" said Mr Teh, a 42-year-old corporate restructuring expert who was formerly group chief financial officer of furniture company Koda.\n\nThe disposal will bump up Sapphire's pro forma net tangible asset per share to 9.5 cents, while cash flows will improve by $71.25 million, which translates to a cash inflow per share of 8.8 cents.\n\nGrappling with an anaemic steel business, a product of falling steel prices and rising cost pressures, Sapphire under Mr Teh had earlier set out an exit plan for the business following a major review that involved ridding itself of the unprofitable minerals trading segment and streamlining operations.\n\n\"We had to make some tough decisions,\" Mr Teh said.\n\nThe proceeds from the divestment will be used for working capital and new investment opportunities.\n\n\"Our investments will be highly selective with a clear objective of returning to profitability at the earliest,\" said Mr Teh.\n\nMeanwhile, what is on the table now is Mancala, an Australian private drilling firm for the mining sector which Sapphire completed buying in January this year for A$15 million (S$17.5 million). The deal was inked barely a week after Mr Teh took over the helm of Sapphire early last October.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth/wealth-investing/focus-big-picture-us-economy-gains-momentum", "site_title": "Focus on the Big Picture as the US economy gains momentum", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nFocus on the Big Picture as the US economy gains momentum\n\nThe normalisation of US monetary policy augurs well for market fundamentals\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Apr 29, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n2014 has started in an uncertain and volatile fashion. China concerns, geopolitical risk plus emerging market anxiety over capital flight saw significant volatility in financial markets. The first quarter is over and many investors are left wondering if this is a year where we may end up with very volatile and poor markets. So far, year-to-date risk assets have underperformed while the usual flight to safety assets have outperformed. Are we missing something here?\n\nLet us look at why markets have underperformed. So far this year, markets have been whipsawed on concerns about the economic momentum in the US, worries on the state of China's overall economy, plus unexpected geopolitical concerns over Ukraine. In the US, economic data does indicate a modest recovery which should see the Fed continue its tapering process. And now concerns have turned to when the Fed will start to raise interest rates. US data from payroll to manufacturing and consumer confidence and spending, seem to indicate underlying strength but if we look at the labour slack and inflation data, it seems the Fed could wait quite a while before they raise interest rates.\n\nThe other major concern out there is China. Most of the economic data appears to indicate a slowing economy. Manufacturing, exports, retail sales are all pointing to a decelerating economy and the government recently did acknowledge this by announcing a mini targeted stimulus to help the economy along. We still are optimistic that the Chinese economy may attain its 7-7.5 per cent growth this year but it is likely to require help from exports and government spending.\n\nReforms will continue and we are likely to hear of more stress building within the debt markets as credit growth is reined in to unwind risky lending practices. As such, expect more negative news on this front for the rest of this year.\n\nOur view is that it is important to take a step back and look at the fundamentals before we overreact.\n\nFirstly, equity markets especially the developed markets performed very strongly last year and the recent pullback can be viewed as a healthy correction. Secondly, even as we are getting mixed signals on US growth, the overall view is that these are distortions as the US is experiencing a very tough winter. Overall signs appear to indicate that the US economy is slowly gaining traction and may experience stronger growth this year.\n\nThe Fed, on the heels of this, will continue to taper. The reaction to this so far has been fear of capital flow out of emerging countries and the subsequent rise of interest rates and slower economic growth.\n\nWhile this may be partially true, not all emerging countries are going to be impacted.\n\nThose with strong current account surpluses and reserves, plus strong export links to the global economy, may be easily able to counter any outflows and as such, if unduly sold down, could be an opportunity for investors to benefit from.\n\nAs such, we continue to believe that when the markets calm down, those emerging markets with strong current accounts and good valuations are likely to attract interest again. Our preferred region is Asia and North Asia in particular.\n\nAs for the developed markets, Europe could be in for outperformance this year as its fundamentals appear to be improving and valuations are still attractive when compared to the other major markets.\n\nThis is a year where, as we transition to growth in the global economy, we will experience volatility as markets adapt to the normalisation of monetary policy. We do feel that the recent sell-off was no more than a correction after a strong equity market performance in 2013.\n\nSo expect more of the same for financial markets as we roll into the summer months. We need to see earnings momentum as growth picks up in the US and for data from China to stabilise.\n\nBut we anticipate that the move up from here may be slow and investors could gravitate to value and sectors that benefit from growth.\n\nThis will require patience and conviction on the part of investors. Overall, it is important to focus on the fundamentals and not get swayed by the news flow. Focus on the big picture, use these corrections wisely and position yourself to better times ahead.\n\nThe writer is chief investment strategist, Investment Strategy Group, Wealth Management at Citi Asia Pacific\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": []}

Revenue, too, dipped 3.4 per cent to $612.6 million, for the quarter ended March 31.\n\nThis was mainly due to a 37.7 per cent drop in revenue from CapitaLand Singapore to $196 million, the only unit that failed to record higher revenue.\n\n\"(This was because) sales from Urban Resort Condominium and The Interlace tapered off after obtaining Temporary Occupation Permit in 2013. There was also the absence of rental income from TechnoPark@Chai Chee which was divested in November 2013,\" it said.\n\nThe Singapore subsidiary is the largest contributor to its top and bottom line. CapitaLand's other direct subsidiaries include CapitaLand China, CapitaMalls Asia and The Ascott Limited.\n\nAn absence of a one-time portfolio gain of $58.7 million compared with the preceding year also affected its income.\n\nYesterday, at CapitaLand's annual general meeting, two shareholders who also own shares in CapitaMalls Asia (CMA) asked if CapitaLand can look into offering a higher price for the mall developer. Chairman Ng Kee Choe replied that the company, bound by rules, cannot comment on the offer. He also advised the shareholders to wait for the independent financial adviser report on the privatisation offer.\n\nCapitaLand recently launched a privatisation offer for CMA to streamline the organisation's structure. Market observers are split on whether the offer is fair for CMA shareholders.\n\nThe company expects demand and prices for private homes to further moderate for the rest of this year under the effect of the Total Debt Servicing Ratio framework and concerns over interest rate hikes.\n\n\"However, the long-term outlook for the residential market remains positive as demand is expected to be supported by governmental policies to promote population and economic growth,\" it said.\n\nA recent marketing campaign to promote Sky Habitat has helped to sell 106 units (out of the total 509) at a total value of $157.6 million. BT recently reported that units at the condo project were re-launched at lower prices amid mounting pressure from upcoming condo launches.\n\nCapitaLand Singapore's Marine Blue and six new residential projects from Capitaland China are expected to be launch-ready in 2014.\n\nCapitaLand shares ended 3 cents lower at $3.24 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was bolstered by contributions from another Maldives resort, Angsana Velavaru, as well as higher contribution from the group's Singapore hotels.\n\n\"Acquisition growth income also helped to offset the loss of income from the closure of Claymore Link for renovations,\" said Vincent Yeo, CEO of the managers of CDLHT. Revenue from Claymore Link (previously Orchard Hotel Shopping Arcade) fell as a large part of the mall has been closed for renovation since last December.\n\nIn addition, the continued weakening of the Australian dollar has led to lower fixed rent contributions from its Australia hotels. Lower contributions from its Australia hotels were exacerbated by lower full-year variable income (which is recognised in Q1) due to the weaker trading performance of its Australia hotels and partial closure of Mercure Brisbane for room refurbishment for five months last year.\n\nSingapore hotels, which contribute to more than half of the group's revenue, averaged an occupancy rate of 88.2 per cent in Q1, with just slightly better revenue per available room (Rev-PAR), bolstered by the return of the biennial Singapore Airshow in February. But it was still pressured by a larger supply of hotel rooms and a restrained corporate travel environment.\n\nBiennial events such as Food & Hotel Asia in April as well as new annual events like World Club 10s Rugby in June and Women's Tennis Association Championships in October are expected to draw more visitors to Singapore - a positive for the group.\n\nIn Australia, where the economy is slowing and the mining sector is seeing less activity, hotels in Brisbane are expected to benefit in the lead-up to the G20 Leaders Summit in November, the group said.\n\nCDLHT is a stapled group comprising CDL Hospitality Reit and CDL Hospitality Business Trust. Its units ended two cents higher at $1.83 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With its new name comes the 4 Series' familiar front fender ducts called Air Breathers to reduce air resistance. So with the roof up, it looks like the Coupe at a glance.\n\nLike the previous 3 Series Convertible, the new 4 Series also uses a practical folding hardtop that offers better acoustic insulation. This rigid retractable roof has been further improved to reduce noise levels, with a sound-absorbing headliner to cut wind noise by up to two decibels.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 25, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE new Mini is, well, less so. The third generation of the modern Mini has the same proportions, but is now longer and wider, with its wheelbase extended by 28mm to 2,495mm.\n\nAs a result of the expanded chassis, the front and rear tracks are now 32mm and 24mm wider respectively. More importantly, the increase in dimensions has yielded a more spacious four-seater cabin, one where elbow and shoulder space is significantly improved; either of the rear seats is comfortable enough for a six-footer.\n\nNo mean feat for a car that is still a diminutive 3.8 m in length.\n\nDespite the size, this new model is still marginally lighter at 1,180 kg - five kg less than the car it replaces.\n\nBut the most striking difference about it is the new engine and new adaptive suspension for the Cooper S. The top-of-the-line Mini has ditched the old 1.6-litre turbocharged engine for a 2.0-litre TwinPower Turbo unit, courtesy of parent BMW.\n\nThis power plant is part of BMW's new Efficient Dynamics engine family, which uses a half-litre cylinder as a building block for a new range of turbocharged three-cylinder, four-cylinder and six-cylinder engines.\n\nThe four-cylinder 2.0 engine in the Mini Cooper S produces 192hp and 280Nm to the front wheels through a more efficient six-speed automatic transmission. This is 8hp and 40Nm more and takes the zero to 100kmh sprint down half a second to 6.7 seconds.\n\nBut still, the Cooper S does not feel as explosive as it sounds. Instead, it has a newfound smoothness and refinement.\n\nFrom inside the cabin, the engine and exhaust sound is muted and the car almost glides over road undulations.\n\nThis is, however, in comfort-oriented Mid setting - one of three driving modes available. At the base of the gear stick, a small lever allows the Sport or Green mode to be selected. In Green, the Dynamic Damper Control is also set to comfort, plus the drivetrain will decouple from 50-160 kmh to allow coasting and save fuel.\n\nBut it is in Sport mode that the Cooper S of old resurfaces. The ride gets harder, the steering heavier and the handling more agile.\n\nThe sound signature changes accordingly too, thanks to Active Sound Design, an acoustic enhancement which processes the engine and exhaust noise and delivers it through the audio system. What is not processed though, is the delightful exhaust backfire when it is driven enthusiastically.\n\nBut even in Sport mode, the go-kart feel is now less obvious and you are more aware of the Mini's size. The front strut/rear multi-link suspension set-up still makes the Cooper S nimble enough to dart in and out of traffic with impunity. But the rawness has been toned down, although it now feels more planted and confident. Add the slower steering and you know the Mini has grown up.\n\nAlso more mature is the roomier cabin, which has been impressively updated. The speedometer is now in front of the driver with a subsidiary tacho.\n\nThe big round meter in the centre console is still there as the Mini Centre Instrument with an LED ring that lights up to match the engine revs. There are many nice new touches, like the ambient light choices, the more conventional power window controls on the door, the keyless ignition (the key fob is still a disc but it doesn't have to be slotted in to start the engine). The front seats also come with squab extensions for taller occupants.\n\nAll the controls have become less dinky but they are still distinctively Mini and extremely stylish. It may have grown up but the Cooper S is still a very fun drive.\n\nsamuelee@sph.com.sg\n\nSPECS\n\nMini Cooper S\n\nEngine\n\n1,998cc inline-4 turbocharged\n\nTransmission\n\n6-speed auto\n\nMax power\n\n192 hp @ 4,700-6,000 rpm\n\nMax torque\n\n280 Nm @ 1,250-4,750 rpm (300 Nm with Overboost)\n\n0-100 kmh\n\n6.7 secs\n\nTop speed\n\n233 kmh\n\nCO2 emissions\n\n127 g/km\n\nAverage OMV\n\n$30,000\n\nPrice\n\n$176,300 (with COE)\n\nDistributor\n\nEurokars Habitat\n\nTel\n\n6473 3777\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This corresponded with the overall weakness in the average occupancy rates for the upscale and mid-tier segments of the Singapore hotel industry, said the trust.\n\nRevenue per available room (RevPar) for the hotel portfolio was $159, down 1.3 per cent from $161 a year earlier.\n\n\"To further optimise value and competitiveness of our properties, we are carrying out asset enhancement initiatives at selected properties. Refurbishments at Village Hotel Albert Court, Village Hotel Changi and Regency House are expected to complete in the coming quarters,\" said Mr Lee.\n\nFar East H-Trust's counter ended one cent higher at $0.89 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It also plans to acquire and develop US$4 billion worth of corporate and serviced apartment assets in Asia, Europe and North America.\n\n\"The joint venture will draw on Mapletree's expertise in Asia and Oakwood Wordwide's strengths in Europe and North America to more than triple the number of branded Oakwood buildings across the globe,\" said Mapletree. It added that it would have an option to \"acquire additional interests in OAP following the successful deployment of the growth strategy\".\n\nMapletree group chief investment officer Chua Tiow Chye told BT that by partnering Oakwood, the group is filling an asset class that seems to be missing in its spectrum of assets as a developer.\n\nAs at end-March, Mapletree owns and operates $24.6 billion of office, logistics, industrial, residential and retail properties globally, but it has a very small collection of hospitality and serviced apartment assets.\n\n\"It seems to be a piece that is increasing in demand,\" said Mr Chua, \"especially in Asia, with the growing inflow of transient or contracted professionals coming into major Asian gateway cities like Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan and China. And when expats come to this part of the world, they are looking for familiar brand names that will give them a sense of security and provide an expected kind of service level.\"\n\nMapletree would thus benefit from partnering a global and world-class brand like Oakwood, he said.\n\nWithin the hospitality sector, Mapletree prefers serviced apartments to hotels because they provide \"more sustainable and resilient cash flow\" and \"less volatile earnings\", given that their inhabitants dwell for longer periods of time - from one to 12 months. Serviced apartments also require less capital expenditure for refurbishments and maintenance of amenities such as ballrooms and restaurants.\n\nMr Chua said that Mapletree would begin with places where it already owns existing office properties. \"That will be the first go, especially since we have presence and staff there to help us evaluate the market, but we will need Oakwood to help us perform the evaluations in unfamiliar territories.\"\n\nWhile Mapletree will buy and develop serviced apartments under a licence to use Oakwood's brands in all markets managed by OAP outside of North America, Oakwood will source and manage acquisition and development deals for Mapletree in North America. Each will also help the other grow beyond its own home ground: Mapletree into the US and Europe, and Oakwood into the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

What has been the impact on your organisation of the global mission to help save Planet Earth?\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Apr 27, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nNick Foley\n\nPresident, South-east Asia & Pacific\n\nLandor\n\nTHE first thing to know about how businesses 'go green' is to understand why they are not doing it. This can be broadly distilled to two key reasons. Firstly, not knowing where to start, and secondly, deferring the responsibility to the government. At Landor we have consulted to a variety of companies on how to implement carbon reduction programmes. In doing this we have maintained our resolve to save the planet. The initial step in 'going green' is to have an internal brand programme that employees are inspired by. Let's face it, creating a healthier planet is an inspiring notion! When Landor worked with one of our global media clients on 'going green' we created an internal engagement programme called 'One degree of change'. The insight that informed this idea was that employees wanted to make a difference, but were seeking a collective body (business or government) to help them take 'small steps' in this direction. A rallying cry, underpinned by a credible and uplifting idea, is the most effective way of garnering the necessary support to truly 'go green'. Companies may be surprised at the positive energy, among their employees, just waiting to be harnessed in order to create a brighter future for our planet.\n\nSarah Montgomery\n\nDirector of Client Solutions, Asia\n\nOpower\n\nBUSINESS has a critical role to play in the mission to protect the environment. Across the globe, businesses are doing well by doing good. At Opower, we are committed to helping reduce global emissions through access to information. Our 93 utility programmes empower consumers to make small changes to their energy consumption which in turn lead to massive energy savings. To date, we've helped save more than 4 terawatt hours of energy, enough to power a city of 1 million people for a year.\n\nOpower is just one example of a company that aligns profits with social good. Investments in clean energy and energy efficiency are creating jobs and pouring money back into local economies. Environmentally responsible companies are finding that adopting a ''second bottom line''- that is, measuring their environmental performance as carefully as their financial performance - doesn't hold them back. It propels them forward. As it turns out, going green is great for business.\n\nPatrick Liew\n\nManaging Partner\n\nGlobal Enterprise Exchange\n\nWHILE businesses know the importance and value of going green, not many have focused on it or even given it due attention. As long as it cannot be legislated on a global basis, there is no impetus to invest time and effort in it.\n\nIf change is to happen, it must start from the lifeline of every business - consumers. They have the power to ensure that businesses incorporate the environmental bottom line as part of their business model. They can compel businesses to compete with one another in the green race to win consumers' hearts and wallets.\n\nTo address the green challenge, more investment is needed to educate and grow the number of green consumers and influence their buying behaviour. These consumers need to be able to access information about the environmental-friendliness of the businesses and products they deal with.\n\nThe challenge is that there is a lack of transparency in this area. It's hard to tell which enterprise is greening its business or, for that matter, not doing its part in protecting the environment. There is no consistent format to benchmark the green effort and outcome.\n\nA more concerted effort is needed to galvanise the people, public, private, and political sectors on a trans-border basis to make it mandatory for enterprises to provide sustainability reporting. These reports should be based on a standard template and made available to consumers.\n\nPerhaps consumers should take the initiative to launch a social media site to ''name and shame'' recalcitrants so that more pressure can be put on them to adopt responsible and sustainable business practices. They should be taken to task with all the available legal, social, political and operational resources.\n\nBusinesses will not change if they don't believe consumers will vote with their feet. They will not take action unless they believe their branding and bank accounts will go downhill if they don't do their part for Planet Earth.\n\nTan Tong Hai\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nStarHub\n\nALL businesses have an impact on the natural environment. Operating in Singapore, the City Within A Garden, reminds us that we should always strive to reduce our environmental impact. To do so, companies can streamline operations, employ the use of technology and even support pro-environmental community initiatives. These could reduce both a company's carbon footprint and operating expenditure.\n\nFor instance, StarHub's modernised mobile network uses energy-efficient technology for electrical savings. Streamlined house calls save us 55,000 litres of fuel annually. Meanwhile, various paperless initiatives serving our customers saved us over 44 tonnes of paper in 2013. Supporting the National Parks Board's Plant-A-Tree Programme, StarHub also planted 100 trees on Pulau Ubin to restore local biodiversity.\n\nAt the end of the day, we all have a part to play in preserving our environment. As they say - We did not inherit the earth from our forefathers; we are preserving it for our children.\n\nKwek Leng Joo\n\nDeputy Chairman\n\nCity Developments Ltd\n\n(an active advocate of sustainable business practices since 1995)\n\nGLOBALLY, buildings account for some 40 per cent of total energy use and 30 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. In Singapore, the building sector is the third largest contributor of carbon emissions. As a major developer and landlord, we took up the challenge as early as the mid-1990s to drive change within our built industry, adopting the ethos to ''Conserve as we construct''.\n\nCDL has been investing between 2 per cent and 5 per cent of the construction cost of a new development on eco-friendly features and innovations. We have also set a target to achieve a minimum Building and Construction Authority (BCA) Green Mark GoldPlus certification rating for our new developments - above the mandatory requirements. From design, construction, procurement, maintenance and user engagement, the entire life cycle of our developments is conceptualised and executed with environmental sustainability in mind.\n\nIn line with our government's vision to make Singapore a ''climate resilient'' city, CDL has since 2011 pledged to reduce our carbon emissions by 22 per cent by 2020 and 25 per cent by 2030 (from baseline year 2007). In 2013, we successfully reduced our carbon emissions by 18 per cent and we are on track to achieve our targets.\n\nTo reduce carbon footprint, influencing the mindset and behaviour of stakeholders through eco-outreach programmes is critical. Since 2004, the CDL 'Let's Live Green!' initiative shares with our homebuyers the eco-features in their new homes, encouraging them to make choices that help reduce their carbon footprint and energy use. Through the CDL 5-Star Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Assessment System and Awards since early 2000s, we have steered many of our builders and consultants towards new benchmarks of sustainable best practices at our project sites. For our tenants and the larger corporate community, Project: Eco-Office, an initiative with the Singapore Environment Council, has helped businesses go green by cultivating eco-friendly habits in the workplace since 2002. In 2013, the campaign reached some 48,000 office workers and over 100 offices have been certified with the Eco-Office Label, including many non-CDL tenants.\n\nToday, sustainability is deeply rooted in our corporate DNA and has been integrated into our business strategy and operations. Being mindful of our carbon footprint has resulted in reduced use of resources, financial savings from reduced energy consumption and even possibly increased capital value of our green developments. Our commitment to sustainability has inspired innovations, captured opportunities and sharpened our competitive edge.\n\nTham Sai Choy\n\nManaging Partner\n\nKPMG in Singapore and Chairman\n\nKPMG Asia-Pacific\n\nTHE financial and economic reasons why companies should 'go green' are not easily understood. The social cost of environmental damage is typically not imposed on the company that creates the damage. Many businesses therefore believe that environment friendliness is a cost to be avoided if at all possible.\n\nLess understood is that green initiatives can be a strategic differentiator. Expectations of the business community are changing, as a younger generation speaks with an increasingly louder voice of a new social compact. What is hitting the profit announcements is not just the direct cost savings from not having to comply with lax environmental legislation, but the equally direct cost of lost loyalty among customers and employees.\n\nFor the converted, green initiatives already have a strong business case. They have already found a route to reducing business costs, or increasing profitability. They have identified ''going green'' as a business imperative, and are articulating their vision to stakeholders. Achievable carbon emission reduction targets are already being set, targeted at areas of the value-chain where reductions have the largest impact. Measurement and monitoring processes already track progress of their green transformation.\n\nOur own efforts in KPMG have involved managing the carbon impact of staff travel, and consumption of energy and resources. Gross emissions have declined by an average of 9 per cent per KPMG employee worldwide, and 19 per cent in Singapore. Concurrently, operational costs have also declined, without affecting service quality or efficiency levels.\n\nLance J Ourednik\n\nGeneral Manager\n\nThe Westin Singapore\n\nTHE Westin Singapore is committed to caring for our planet and doing more to consume less. We embrace our responsibility for environmental stewardship and continually look at ways of integrating leading environmental practices and sustainability principles into our business operations. With the recent launch of our Green Rooms, our guests can track, and hopefully reduce, their energy consumption. For each guest who meets the targeted energy consumption level, the hotel donates US$1 to UNICEF.\n\nThe hotel is also proud to have the first luxury limousine fleet in Singapore to consist completely of biodiesel-powered vehicles. The biodiesel is obtained exclusively from recycling waste cooking oil generated by The Westin Singapore, thereby forming a self-sustaining ''waste-to-energy'' loop. These initiatives provide innovative opportunities for us to minimise waste and conserve natural resources while delivering exceptional guest experiences.\n\nScott Morris\n\nVice-President & General Manager\n\nNetApp Asean\n\nCLIMATE change is upon us. We are seeing rising temperatures and unnaturally cold and long winters across the globe. Even Singapore recently recorded its longest dry spell to date. The responsibility is therefore on us to ensure that we build and develop businesses, cities, and communities that respect and protect our environment.\n\nBusinesses can reduce their carbon footprint significantly through virtualisation and the adoption of cloud technologies. Cloud services free companies from the need to own and run on-premise data centres.\n\nNetApp has a firm commitment towards green IT and building management so we aggressively develop and adopt technologies that curb power consumption. We build our hardware with recyclable materials and efficient electronics components to reduce wastage. We also go beyond our areas of discipline and look into issues like data centre design to help our customers get more out of their technology without added energy consumption or cost.\n\nSeah Kian Peng\n\nCEO (Singapore)\n\nNTUC FairPrice Co-operative Ltd\n\nAN effective sustainable programme is one which ensures that eco-friendly initiatives are aligned with business objectives. At NTUC FairPrice, we embrace sustainable practices in all aspects of our operations and also involve our staff and the community in our ongoing green efforts. For example, through encouraging customers to ''Bring Your Own Bag'', we saved 8.2 million plastic bags last year alone.\n\nOur annual signature Share-A-Textbook Project has helped to recycle more than 2.75 million textbooks in the past 30-plus years. We partner organisations like WWF to encourage the community to save resources and we work with agencies like BCA for the Green Mark certification for our stores - indeed, some of our stores have already attained the Platinum and Gold standards. Our staff also do their part for the environment by actively participating in green activities such as tree planting and reducing waste generated in the office. As a responsible retailer, we will continue to enhance our current initiatives and explore new ones to build a sustainable environment together.\n\nChris Mead\n\nRegional Director\n\nHays in Singapore & Malaysia\n\nAT Hays we recognise the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support the Singapore government's commitment in this regard. As a recruitment services company, the direct environmental effects of our business largely relate to facilities management and travel. We aim to reduce the environmental impact of our business through a reduction in consumption and conserving resources.\n\nIn 2013, and for the fourth year running, we undertook an environmental review of our business operations and for the first time this review covered all of Hays' offices globally. In readiness for mandatory carbon reporting, we developed and rolled out an online carbon footprint reporting portal.\n\nData collected through the portal from Hays offices around the world, grouped by countries, included operational and vehicle use, electricity consumption and business travel. From this data, our greenhouse gas emissions were calculated. We are pleased to say that we reduced our carbon emissions by 17 per cent in 2013 when compared with 2012. This was mostly driven by a number of energy efficiency initiatives combined with information gathering and analysis in this area. As a results-orientated company we are continually driven to succeed and this ambition will drive our ongoing initiatives in this area in the years to come.\n\nCatherine Low\n\nManaging Director\n\nCountry Manager, Singapore\n\nHead of International Trade & Export Finance, Asia\n\nING Bank NV\n\n''GREEN'' initiatives need not be seen as separate and incorporating them into the business can create long-term value.\n\nAt ING Bank, reducing our environmental impact in the countries where we operate, of which 12 are in Asia Pacific, starts with investing in efficiency solutions in our operations, sourcing for renewable energy wherever we can, and integrating sustainability in our process. Today, 73 per cent of ING's electricity comes from renewable sources and we have been operating 100 per cent carbon-neutral since 2007.\n\nAs a global financial institution, ING also recognises that we can play a role in building a ''greener'' world at the core of what we do - financing clients who are pro-actively addressing sustainability challenges like resource scarcity and energy efficiency. And the result is having 39 per cent of our global project finance energy portfolio allocated to renewable energy deals.\n\nNot forgetting the importance of employees' involvement, we tap on the creativity and enthusiastic participation of our employees to find various ways of supporting environmental-friendly causes. In 2013, we contributed to the global ''Liter of Light'' project where ING staff in Asia pledged to donate ''solar bulbs'' to families in the Philippines, in return for commitment of each staff to use reusable cutlery and containers. We received The Staff Engagement Award from World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Singapore for our internal staff engagement activities.\n\nThe effort taken by ING and all our employees did not go unnoticed. We have been included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices 2013 and received RobecoSAM Sustainability Award 2014, Bronze Class distinction for our sustainability performance.\n\nDaniel Rudolph\n\nPresident\n\nHenkel Singapore\n\nSOCIETY faces immense challenges ranging from population growth to rising consumption and resource depletion. We must become five times more efficient by 2050, if we are to continue living within the means of the planet.\n\nAt Henkel, we recognise the need to ''achieve more with less'' and we have set a goal to triple by 2030 the value we create compared to the environmental footprint of our products and services.\n\nWe focus our efforts in six areas that summarise the challenges of sustainability - safety and health, performance, social progress, energy and climate, water and wastewater, and material and waste. In each area, we drive progress along the entire value chain via our people, our partners, and products and technologies. As of 2013, we had achieved significant progress in all six areas, including a 15 per cent improvement in energy efficiency and 50 per cent gains in occupational health and safety since 2010.\n\nTakeo Shimazu\n\nManaging Director\n\nBrother International Singapore\n\nSOMETHING as simple as setting up a printer to print double-sided by default can help businesses enhance their brands and motivate their employees to go green. Businesses can also engage employees with fun initiatives and workshops to explain the impact of their actions on the environment.\n\nBrother is working hard to protect the environment with 'Project Homecoming' by recycling consumable products as improper disposal can cause damage to the environment.\n\nThis initiative saw Brother and four other printer companies collaborate to manage a ink and toner cartridge recycling campaign, regardless of its brand. The raw materials within are then recovered and reused for other purposes. It aims to encourage the recycling of cartridges through the provision of easily accessible bins for the public. It further aims to raise community awareness around the importance of this effort, as well as recycling in general.\n\nJoshua Soh\n\nManaging Director for Singapore and Brunei\n\nCisco\n\nIT'S a fallacy that technology adoption always leads to higher power consumption. We believe innovation can inverse this relationship to drive higher technology adoption and lower energy usage.\n\nBy changing the way we work, live, play and learn, we can reduce our carbon footprint on a daily basis. For example, with Cisco TelePresence\u00ae, Cisco was able to help avoid travel for 32 per cent of meetings globally, saving 700,000 tonnes of attributable CO2 emissions.\n\nAt our Singapore office, our lights and air-flow systems are controlled by motion sensors, our IP phone screens are automatically powered down after-hours to minimise power wastage and we run quarterly exercises where employees are encouraged to bring their electronic waste for recycling and eco-friendly disposal.\n\nBusinesses in Singapore can reduce their carbon footprint and raise productivity by adopting mobility technologies alongside flexible work arrangements. An agile work environment gives employees the freedom to work from any place at any time. It can also alleviate the peak-hour strain on our transport infrastructure. This helps Singapore lower emissions generated by commuting and gives employees better worklife harmony.\n\nRob Bratby\n\nManaging Partner\n\nOlswang Asia\n\nALL businesses have a responsibility to ensure that they are making a positive impact on the community and the environment in which they operate.\n\nAt Olswang, we have established a new way of offsetting our carbon emissions with the creation of the Green Seed Fund. We ask our employees to nominate green projects that they think are worthy of Olswang's financial support. We then judge these projects and award funds, which reflects a monetary value against the carbon we have produced the previous year.\n\nWe recently supported a project at Willing Hearts Soup Kitchen - an initiative to design, build and maintain a garden for Willing Hearts' new site in Singapore.\n\nIn our head office, we keep a roof garden and a bee farm, which gives our staff the opportunity to play an active part in our green efforts\n\nOlswang was also recently awarded the BCA Green Mark Platinum Award for its green practices in Singapore.\n\nIt is essential that businesses implement imaginative and fun green initiatives as part of their environmental programme to help reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nMichael Anderton\n\nManaging Director, Building Efficiency,\n\nJohnson Controls Singapore\n\nNO longer seen as just a corporate social responsibility initiative, going green has become a business imperative to address global warming and shortage of resources caused by rapid urbanisation and population growth. Thankfully, advances in technology have enabled companies to rethink and improve the way resources are used.\n\nAt Johnson Controls, we believe that improving energy efficiency in buildings is a critical step towards achieving sustainability. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, buildings account for about 40 per cent of total final energy consumption globally. By adopting energy-efficient equipment and performance management systems in their buildings and offices, businesses can optimise their consumption and significantly reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nIn Singapore, Johnson Controls' energy-efficient products and solutions, as well as services, can be found in almost 40 per cent of commercial and industrial buildings, thus enabling many buildings here to achieve green building targets, reduce carbon emissions and save costs.\n\nBrendan Wauters\n\nPresident & CEO\n\nSenoko Energy Pte Ltd\n\nCLIMATE change affects us all. As Singapore's largest power generator, Senoko Energy is strongly committed to environmental sustainability. Our efforts in this area are concentrated along three key axes.\n\nFirst, in our power generation activities, we have steadily reduced our environmental impact through the adoption of advanced and highly efficient combined cycle power generation technology, and through the switch to natural gas as our fuel of reference. These and other measures have resulted in Senoko Energy's carbon footprint last year being almost 40 per cent lower than in the year 2000.\n\nSecond, we work closely with our customers and provide them advice and support in their efforts to improve their energy efficiency, and hence lower their carbon footprint. This includes helping businesses to identify relevant assistance schemes they can tap into to help finance the implementation of energy efficiency measures.\n\nThird, climate change is also a key axis of our corporate social responsibility (CSR) programme. We organise, among others, the Senoko Sustainability Challenge, a competition for primary and secondary students. We hope that, through these and other initiatives, we contribute to educating our youth, who will have to be the leaders of tomorrow in the fight against climate change, about the importance of sustainable living.\n\nHeinrich Jessen\n\nChairman\n\nJebsen & Jessen (SEA)\n\nWITH both domestic and industrial energy consumption reliant on fossil fuels, it seems only right to make a difference where you can. I often refer to a famous quote by Edmund Burke: ''Nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could do a little''.\n\nWe hope that our carbon neutrality project, along with other initiatives happening in Singapore, encourages our colleagues in all sectors to develop their own journey towards carbon neutrality. A trickle can become a stream and then a trend.\n\nTeo Lay Lim\n\nSenior Managing Director\n\nAccenture, Asean\n\nENVIRONMENTALLY sustainable growth is central to all businesses. Accenture's environmental strategy spans our entire business operation, comprising four areas: running efficient operations, working sustainably, enabling client sustainability and providing insights to advance sustainability. Besides managing and monitoring our resource conservation efforts, our people champion sustainable growth by using virtual collaboration technologies and exploring alternative travel arrangements.\n\nThis has helped us to reduce per employee carbon emissions in fiscal 2013 by more than 36 per cent from our fiscal 2007 baseline. Accenture is also among the CDP Global 500, which tracks how the world's largest listed companies are addressing climate change.\n\nMore importantly, we strive to contribute to the overall environmental agenda by serving as a collaborator, convener and thought leader. Accenture conducted the 2013 United Nations Global Compact's triennial CEO study, the world's largest CEO study on sustainability. We also convene thought leaders from around the world at Sustainability 24, an annual forum to discuss issues and opportunities in business sustainability.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPLAN-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\nTHE climate changes which we are experiencing are making people sit up and be more concerned about the need to protect natural resources. However, it is fair to say that although there is progress, it is painfully slow. Until there is consumer pressure on businesses to go green and to demand only green products and services, businesses will continue to put priority on generating profits, and not invest in green solutions and technologies.\n\nThe reality is that the global carbon footprint has not shrunk. Many CEOs may not be around to see the adverse consequences of not going green - hence, for many businesses, yet another lack of a compelling reason to fast-track their greening initiatives. For many, it is NATO - no action, talk only - to join in the popular chorus.\n\nGovernments' hands in pushing and legislating businesses to go green have also been weak so far. Until the US and China agree on their share of the global carbon footprint, the status quo is likely to persist for some time. All the money that governments have spent in global meetings such as that in Kyoto could have been better deployed in financing low-cost and simple solutions to uplift the lives of the poor in under-developed countries, for example by providing LED lighting in villages, while at the same time contribute to the greening of GAIA.\n\nArmin Bruck\n\nPresident & CEO\n\nSiemens Pte Ltd\n\nAS one of the world's largest suppliers of green technologies, Siemens aims not just to reduce our own carbon footprint but that of our customers' too. Within our Environmental Portfolio, we develop technologies and manufacture products that save electricity and reduce emissions in regular, everyday use; and which make manufacturing processes and operations less resource-intensive.\n\nIn fiscal 2013, this Environmental Portfolio generated 32.3 billion euros in revenue - that's 43 per cent of our company's total revenue - and we helped our customers save energy cost and 377 million tonnes of CO2 emissions - the equivalent of the following 12 cities' combined yearly emissions: Berlin, Cape Town, London, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Mexico City, Moscow, New York City, Sao Paulo, Seoul, Singapore and Tokyo.\n\nTan Chong Huat\n\nManaging Partner\n\nRHTLaw Taylor Wessing\n\nALL businesses, regardless of their size or sector, can manage and reduce their carbon footprint. Generally, this can be approached like any business strategy - by assessing the risks and opportunities, setting goals and resources, developing and implementing a plan to achieve those goals, and monitoring the results.\n\nSome of the measures that we are taking as an organisation:\n\nWe encourage staff to be smart about the paper that we use. Technology allows us to organise our inbox to make e-mail easier to find and reference.\n\nWe need to do more to respond to the challenges we face and be responsible guardians of Planet Earth. If we stand as one, I am confident we can make a difference.\n\nMartin Hayes\n\nPresident\n\nBosch in South-east Asia\n\nAT Bosch, we believe that businesses of today must continually examine their operations and practices for opportunities to modernise and adopt clean technologies. Companies will not only reduce their carbon footprint, they will also achieve cost savings because of the increased energy efficiencies.\n\nPioneering green technologies that enable companies to reduce their carbon footprint is Bosch's vision of a sustainable future. Worldwide, we have been developing innovative solutions towards a greener environment not just in the automotive industry, but also in other sectors such as building, infrastructure and industrial technology.\n\nDubbed Asia's greenest metropolis and one of the world's most-connected cities, Singapore has a forward-looking ecosystem that embraces green and sustainable technologies for today's ecological challenges. We look forward to creating solutions that enable Singapore to become the smart, clean and efficient city that it strives to be.\n\nRicardo Pesce\n\nManaging Director\n\nEmbraer Asia Pacific\n\nAS an aircraft manufacturer, it is our priority to reduce our carbon footprint throughout all our activities and we encourage our employees to come up with innovative ways to do so. From the conceptualisation of a product all through its usage and end of life, Embraer applies Design for Environment practices that foresee and reduce the impact to the environment. We also constantly improve the design of our aircraft to maximise fuel efficiency, as in the case of our second generation of E-Jets launched last year.\n\nWe were the first to manufacture a crop duster aircraft that is 100 per cent powered by ethanol, derived from sugar cane. Called the Ipanema, there are more than 1,300 units produced to date. Also during the Rio + 20 summit in 2012, our E195 jet made an experimental flight in Brazil using renewable fuel, and the success of the flight is paving the way for the certification process of the biofuel. Going green not only helps to minimise our impact on the environment, it continuously challenges us to improve the way we do things.\n\nMike Muller\n\nPresident, Asia Pacific\n\nAvaya\n\nEARTH Day serves as a reminder for businesses that profitability and responsibility go hand in hand. Success for an enterprise can be largely judged by its ability to use resources thoughtfully, efficiently and effectively in a manner that brings the highest returns while easing off pressure on fast-depleting natural resources. Technology and innovations in mobile, video and unified communication technologies open up options for businesses to use alternative methods of communications as and when needed.\n\nFor us at Avaya, it is a reminder to give our customers highly effective communications solutions that have a direct impact on performance and savings. As a firm believer in the benefits of technology, we use our technology to change the way we work. Video communications is becoming a default communication option for us and has enabled us to cut carbon emissions by 46 per cent and save 44,265,627 flyer miles per year. Going green for Avaya has meant higher productivity, efficiency and cost savings.\n\nRaed S Haddad\n\nManaging Director, Asia Pacific\n\nESI International\n\nTECHNOLOGY can offer businesses the means to drive efficiencies and help reduce environmental impact. One such technological advance is digitisation which enables organisations to minimise material wastage and lower the overall carbon footprint.\n\nAt ESI, we are consciously aware of the negative impact created by printed books and course materials, and have started offering digital course materials for our training programmes. We have been heartened that our clients have embraced this initiative positively, in appreciation of both the green initiative and the convenience of accessing materials with their mobile devices, without having to carry bulky printed copies to the classroom.\n\nSustainable business practices can create competitive advantage for organisations when they make sound economic sense. In our case, we have benefited from the effects of cost reduction and increased customer satisfaction as a result of going green.\n\nV R Srivatsan\n\nManaging Director, Asean\n\nAutodesk\n\nSUSTAINABILITY is at the core of Autodesk. We believe design offers humanity our greatest hope for addressing some of the most urgent, non-negotiable challenges of our time. With the right tools, designers can access information that was previously inaccessible in the design environment, empowering them to redesign the way we live.\n\nOur endeavour is to empower clean technology pioneers to create a more sustainable and better world. Through our Clean Tech Partner Programme, we provide clean tech innovators with $150,000 worth of 3D design software at a fraction of the cost to develop solutions that will help solve the most pressing environmental challenges.\n\nAutodesk also helps city planners and business leaders go green without compromising on economic development. Our C-FACT methodology offers city leaders a means to set greenhouse gas targets that are not only grounded in climate science, but also aligned in proportion to the city's contribution to the economy.\n\nStephen Pimbley\n\nDirector\n\nSPARK Architects\n\nGREENING of buildings to reduce carbon footprint need not be complicated or expensive as there are many proven methods of cooling and ventilation that can help moderate the environment. At Spark Architects, we apply this as the basis for many of the projects we have designed in South-east Asia, particularly in Clarke Quay where a combination of shading and air movement over water reduces the ambient temperature by 4 degrees without the use of excessive amounts of energy as would be required by air conditioning. Developers and agents who sell retail and office space to the market need to understand and embrace the importance of not resorting to high levels of energy-guzzling cooling systems, as it defeats the original purpose.\n\nThe Capita Green project in Singapore's CBD that we are in charge of will be a test case; its system of passive cooling to reduce air-con load is an ambitious step forward in designing a new generation of semi-passive office buildings in tropical countries.\n\nThe blurring of boundaries between living, playing and working are becoming more evident in our society - people are demanding ''life-style'' working environments, going to work in a garden, bringing the great outdoors indoors rather than perpetuating the idea of the anonymous Monsieur Hulot slaving away in an over-chilled, boring and relentless grey office space that we have become accustomed to since the 1960s.\n\nIt's about time, but the going green revolution will take a while yet to break the stranglehold commercial developers have on the property market. As architects, we play a crucial role in helping save the planet by always devising clever and creative designs to cool down buildings and spaces to reduce carbon footprint.\n\nDevan Nair\n\nGroup CEO & Chairman\n\nALIFE Air Automobiles Pte Ltd\n\nGLOBAL warming and its environmental impact is at its peak and even here in Singapore, we are not insulated from the impact of climate change. A combined effort is required to ensure the reduction of carbon emissions, and businesses need to lead the way. For the majority of businesses who want to ''go green'', the first step should be an attitude that ''no effort is too small''.\n\nFor businesses in Singapore just starting their sustainability efforts, they should reach out to the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) which can provide guidance on the environmental impact of businesses and how to adopt carbon-friendly practices.\n\nAt ALIFE Air Automobiles, we've taken it upon ourselves to find a sustainable solution for the automobile industry. Today, vehicles release more than 1.5 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere each year. With this in mind, we have launched our very own range of Singapore-made automobiles closely followed by a clean air solution for Singapore and the region - stay tuned for more details.\n\nRuth Yeoh\n\nExecutive Director\n\nYTL Singapore Pte Ltd\n\nENVIRONMENTAL responsibility in industrial, commercial and large-scale manufacturing entities not only serve to influence the behaviour of others and set new benchmarks but also have a very real impact in materially reducing emissions, waste, energy and water consumption. For YTL Corporation, an international conglomerate serving more than 12 million customers in three continents, sustainability remains a core part of our business strategy and is integrated into decision making processes.\n\nIn recognising the dire effects of climate change, the YTL Group proactively pursues responsible practices by setting targets, implementing robust monitoring systems and actively investing in renewable energy and waste management to reduce the carbon footprint of all manufacturing and operational units. Businesses can effect positive change by cutting carbon and growing profits simultaneously through establishing new sustainability-driven standards.\n\nThe YTL Group's simple but powerful tagline is ''A Steward of Our Good Earth'' - we believe sustainability is not a lone crusade but must adopt a holistic approach. Everyone is an environmentalist, whether we like it or not. We all inhabit this Earth and have a responsibility towards its well-being.\n\nSteve Edwards\n\nChairman, President and CEO\n\nBlack & Veatch\n\nBUSINESSES need to consider what they can do today and plan for tomorrow. Whether you are part of a local or global business, we face the same challenge and responsibility to understand how we can reduce our environmental impact and create more sustainable working practices that ensure the prosperity of the communities we serve. As leaders, fathers and mothers, we should learn more about the world around us, how it connects with our business and how a positive impact on the environment could benefit our bottom line.\n\nThis informed mindset can create change. Thanks to events like the Singapore International Water Week, a greater and growing knowledge and understanding of the interconnection of water and energy is convincing utilities throughout the world to change their operations, save water and energy in new and innovative ways, and, in turn, yield powerful financial benefits.\n\nMatthew Kong\n\nSingapore Country Manager\n\nEmerson Network Power\n\nTO Emerson Network Power, a watt is a terrible thing to waste. Inefficiency doesn't just waste energy; it affects manpower and capital, and can mean the difference between having the resources to plan for growth versus being consumed by daily operational issues. To make every watt count, we've compiled best practices and the latest thinking on energy optimisation through our Energy Logic 2.0 initiative and made the advice available for free through resources such as an e-book.\n\nTechnology that provides visibility into energy consumption and operating efficiency can help businesses become greener by maximising energy usage, minimising energy waste and reducing utility costs, but all businesses, including ours, need to guard against inefficiencies on different fronts. Inefficient processes that delay the adoption of new technologies, inefficient use of capital created by underutilised resources, and inefficient use of energy resulting from poor technology choices and stranded capacity all have to be considered.\n\nRussell Tham\n\nRegional President\n\nApplied Materials South-east Asia\n\nCOMPANIES can go green by ensuring their business operations and initiatives are implemented with the goal of preserving the environment and protecting the health and safety of workers, customers and communities. At Applied Materials, we produce equipment which enable energy-efficient electronics such as smartphones, flat screen TVs and solar panels. We also incorporate eco-friendly initiatives in our facilities and community outreach efforts. Our BCA green mark platinum Singapore Operations Centre is built with multiple advanced technical and design features which conserve energy and water.\n\nInternally and at the community level, Applied Materials actively spreads the message of environmental conservation among employees through our annual Earthworks campaign and educates the young on the importance of technology and environmental consciousness through community partners such as the NECDC for the Applied Materials Science Explorer Camp and Solar eHaven at Chongzheng Primary School, and Marsiling Secondary School for the Environment Education Hub. These initiatives have made a positive social contribution in the communities we operate and developed a sense of corporate citizenship within the organisation.\n\nKen Mandel\n\nManaging Director, Asia Pacific\n\nHootsuite\n\nHOOTSUITE is committed to creating and sustaining an eco-friendly work environment - from where we work to the way we work. Green, after all, is the (HootSuite mascot) owl's natural setting. At our global headquarters in Vancouver, we have a composting and recycling programme in place. We make every effort to significantly reduce our waste output, from encouraging our employees to use our washable dishes and cutlery to providing organic fruits to reusing and repurposing old office furniture. Most of our documents are created and shared digitally, including contracts.\n\nThe digital nature of our business is also serendipitously (and increasingly purposely) geared towards maximising energy efficiency. The City of Melbourne uses our social media platform to digitally promote and manage its eco-friendly activities and sustainability messaging, but more importantly, to communicate and address road closures and public transport service disruptions. Understanding the flow of people, vehicles and utility is essential to efficiency, and social media can provide a crowdsourced ''smart meter'' of what's working and what's not. In effect, users offset their carbon footprint by doing their part in providing information on public infrastructure, and sharing eco-friendly ideas.\n\nUltimately, the success of ''Green Cities'' depends on a well informed, actively participating community. An open dialogue between public, companies and the government is the key to sustainability.\n\nRonnie Tay\n\nChief Executive\n\nNational Environment Agency (NEA)\n\nAS cities urbanise, business activity and consumption patterns will drive up the volume of waste generated, and provide challenges to keeping cities clean. We need the collective effort of government, businesses and the community to work together in co-creating solutions for a better quality of life and the environment.\n\nOver the years, Singapore has put in place a cost-effective and integrated waste management system and encourage 3R (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) practices among industries and communities. There have also been initiatives to uplift the capabilities and productivity of the cleaning sector in order to sustain a clean environment for all. Through CleanEnviro Summit Singapore, we aim to create a platform for environmental leaders, policy makers and industry captains to come together to connect, examine and discover practical solutions to address environmental challenges.\n\nJonathan Asherson\n\nRegional Director, Asean & Pacific.\n\nRolls-Royce\n\nIN pursuit of better power for a changing world, we believe that advanced engineering has a critical role to play in achieving a sustainable future. At Rolls-Royce we spend over \u00a3900 million a year on research and development, with two-thirds aimed at improving the environmental performance of our products.\n\nIn the aerospace sector, we are working towards a long-term goal to improve engine fuel-efficiency by 30 per cent by 2050, relative to 2000. In the marine sector, our Environship concept reduces carbon dioxide emissions by up to 40 per cent compared to similar diesel powered vessels. In the energy sector our current product line includes the Trent 60 which has established a new benchmark for fuel economy.\n\nWe continue to develop our recently-established business unit addressing opportunities in the civil nuclear sector to support electricity generation. We are committed to developing the most efficient power systems in the world. This helps the environment and our customers by enabling them to do more, using less. In essence we focus capital, technology and people at the issue, all the time.\n\nDhirendra Shantilal\n\nBoard Director & Head of Asia Pacific\n\nFircroft\n\nGOING green is not simply a matter of good PR - it impacts your bottom line. Cutting out incandescent lights, improving heating and cooling efficiency, reducing the volume of your packaging and other environmentally-friendly initiatives all result in lower costs. Fundamentally it is about efficiency, going through your business processes and cutting out waste.\n\nWith more than 30 dedicated government schemes in Singapore to support firms looking to become more sustainable, companies should make every effort to go green and reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nAt Fircroft, this mindfulness of sustainability underpins our daily processes and decisions - we pause before printing and often discover most documents can be viewed and shared electronically. Across the office, we've switched to LED lighting that are sensor dependent and our waste is recycled. These little changes which have taken little effort to implement have gone a long way to reducing our carbon footprint, and reduced our overheads in some way.\n\nNando Cesarone\n\nPresident, South Asia District\n\nUPS Asia Pacific\n\nWITH increased focus on sustainability, companies are looking at minimising their carbon footprint. UPS has a longstanding commitment to drive improvement of the transportation industry through sustainable business practices.\n\nPackaging and paper form a large component of our customers' shipments. Solutions like UPS Paperless Invoice eliminates the need for printed invoices by transmitting invoice data electronically. A carbon neutral shipping option is also available to environmentally-aware customers.\n\nUPS's environmental strategy also supports the use of lower-emission alternative fuels. With vehicles representing about 35 per cent of UPS's carbon footprint, UPS is committed to accelerating testing and deployment of new-generation vehicles and emissions-reducing technology. Across Asia, UPS has introduced hybrid-electric and compressed natural gas vehicles to its existing fleet of over 2,700 vehicles worldwide. In 2013, UPS became a founding member of Green Freight Asia, a not-for-profit association dedicated to sustainable transportation practices.\n\nAs part of our Global Forestry Initiative, UPS planted 1.3 million trees worldwide in markets, including Singapore, last year. We aim to reach 2 million trees by end-2014.\n\nKhoo Teng Chye\n\nExecutive Director\n\nCentre for Liveable Cities\n\nCITIES, which account for two-thirds of the world's overall energy consumption, are central to solving the world's environmental challenges. Singapore is showing leadership in this through the World Cities Summit, Singapore International Water Week, and CleanEnviro Summit Singapore which will be held in June 2014. We are bringing together the world's city leaders, international experts and solution providers to discuss sustainable development challenges, share solutions, and learn best practices from cities around the world.\n\nJohnny Lu\n\nManaging Director, Asia Pacific\n\nGMC Software Technology\n\nA BUSINESS needs to keep customers happy while balancing its impact on the environment. One way that it can reduce its carbon footprint is to look at how it uses paper. Paperless communications enables customers to receive information the way they prefer, whether it is SMS, e-mail or online requests through a website. As we see it, the future is about Dynamic Communication. We have seen our clients respond to customer demand with an increased desire for mobile and e-mail-based customer communications, and by reduced paper-based campaigns.\n\nGoing green is a collaborative effort - businesses can educate customers about the advantages of electronic communications over print. Electronic statements can enhance static paper statements through being able to display the same information in different formats and allowing more or fewer details to be shown, as a customer wants. Offering customers the option of receiving electronic statements via the device of their choice is a great initiative.\n\nTom Zack\n\nPresident SEA\n\nEMC Corporation\n\nIN the past two decades the development of information technology (IT) has had a huge impact on businesses. Access to information has become an equaliser and a mobiliser in the effort to meet two urgent challenges: climate change and our ability to create a sustainable global environment. IT is growing at an astonishing rate.\n\nAccording to the latest Digital Universe report, sponsored by EMC, the amount of information in the Digital Universe would fill a stack of iPad Air tablets reaching two-thirds of the way to the moon. By 2020, there will be 6.6 stacks. Currently, developed markets still represent most of the digital universe, but by 2020, emerging markets will account for the majority of data.\n\nEMC has considered the implications of the growing Digital Universe which require a large amount of resources to build data centres, leading to higher energy demand. At EMC, we are committed to work towards minimising our environmental impact by attaining higher levels of efficiency. In 2013, we required all of our IT Asset Dispassion (ITAD) suppliers to become R2 or e-Stewards certified, helping to ensure that our electronics recyclers minimise risk to human or environmental health, both in their own facilities and by downstream handlers and protect data on used electronics.\n\nAs a result, we now have certified ITAD suppliers in Ireland, India, and Thailand and we continue to build these capabilities across other markets as well. EMC stays committed to continue decreasing our environmental impact by obtaining 50 per cent of our electrical needs from renewable sources by 2040.\n\nWolfgang Huppenbauer\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDaimler South East Asia Pte Ltd\n\nAT Daimler, we define sustainability as a responsible corporate behaviour that leads to long-term business success and is in harmony with our economic, ecological and social goals.\n\nAs the inventor of the automobile and a pioneer in automotive engineering, Daimler continues to shape the future of mobility today with our innovative green and safety technologies that even extend to autonomous driving. On the path to zero-emission and accident-free motoring, our vehicles now lead in terms of environmental compatibility and efficiency.\n\nWe are moving towards our goals by making sustainability a firmly integrated aspect of our operations and by requiring and promoting a strong sense of responsibility for sustainable operations among all employees throughout the group. We engage in on-going dialogue with our stakeholders and business partners to facilitate the continuation and possible modification of our sustainability strategy, as we strive to achieve a leading position in the area of sustainability.\n\nChandran Nair\n\nManaging Director\n\nNational Instruments Singapore\n\nCONCERNS about climate change are driving a global push to think and act 'green', with individuals and organisations becoming increasingly active in reducing their carbon footprint. At National Instruments, we strive to minimise our carbon footprint by conserving natural resources, setting expectations with suppliers and recycling old products. In recent years, we have also reduced packaging materials for our large-volume hardware product line by 40 per cent.\n\nAbove and beyond global sustainability practices within the organisation, we are very much committed to green engineering. The process of using hardware and software technologies to reduce environmental impact, green engineering is anchored on the ''measure it, fix it'' concept: Identify and measure the problem so you know how to fix it. With real-world measurement data, organisations can better understand how they are consuming resources and find ways to improve efficiency, reduce waste, and move towards cleaner alternatives.\n\nTo further promote green engineering, we set up the National Instruments Green Engineering Grant which provides start-up assistance for companies or research organisations planning to use our tools as a component of their clean energy, energy efficiency, or smart grid system. Since the inception of this grant programme in 2010, we have helped more than 40 companies deliver their clean energy solutions to market faster through applications such as wind power, energy storage and electric vehicles.\n\nGreg McIntyre\n\nPresident\n\nCH2M HILL Water Market\n\nAT CH2M HILL, we embed sustainable principles into everything we do, developing solutions that respond to critical global issues, our clients' business realities, and the values important to stakeholders.\n\nOur clients face uncertainty in many areas. How can they provide access to plentiful, clean water? How will they manage the effects of climate change? How will they fund needed infrastructure?\n\nSolving these interconnected questions requires courageous leadership, creativity, and technical and business innovation. CH2M HILL applies our whole systems approach and technical expertise to turn sustainability strategy into action. By integrating sustainability principles into each step of the project, we help clients develop creative ways to solve complex challenges, maximise shareholder value, and benefit communities for the long term.\n\nCH2M HILL applauds PUB for creating platforms such as Singapore International Water Week to bring the whole water ecosystem together to co-create innovative water solutions, encouraging businesses to be more water efficient and sustainable.\n\nPeter Hoad\n\nSingapore Office Leader\n\nArup\n\nAT the heart of our design is the passion to deliver sustainable solutions to our clients and their projects. Governed by this ethos, it is important that our employees are also imbued with this sense of environmental awareness. Some of our current initiatives to raise awareness include recycling paper, automatic double sided printing, sorting out waste, providing biodegradeable boxes for employees who pack meals, issuing all employees with their own cutlery to limit the use of disposable utensils and switching off lights for an hour during lunchtime. To measure the extent and rate of these activities, we use an in-house software called Arup Realtime, which uses active data to guide sustainability-related behaviour change.\n\nBeyond implementing company-wide policies, businesses can reduce their carbon footprint by making the conscious decision to house operations within eco-friendly buildings. Singapore has made a strong environmental statement in a relatively short space of time, with its mandate to progress towards a target of 80 per cent of buildings Green Mark certified by 2030.\n\nArup is committed to creating living, breathing spaces that are inherently designed to lessen environmental impact. One of our projects that exemplify this is The Star, which was carefully designed to have naturally ventilated corridors and an open-air amphitheatre which minimises the need for air conditioning.\n\nThe soon-to-be-opened Singapore Sports Hub will feature an innovative energy-efficient system that delivers cooled air to every seat in the stadium, reducing energy use significantly compared to a conventional overhead cooling system. These green buildings are indicative of the progress Singapore is making towards a goal of a more sustainable future. We look forward to continued developments for the betterment of Singapore, our environment and our world.\n\nStevan Hoyle\n\nPresident of Asia and Africa\n\nVodafone Global Enterprise\n\nWITH an urgent and growing need to protect our environment we can do our part by adopting a dual pronged strategy - actively reducing our own carbon footprint and continually innovating to support sustainable development.\n\nAt Vodafone, we have put environmental management systems in place to manage our energy use, carbon emissions, as well as a range of other environmental impacts. It is our goal to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions per network node by 50 per cent by 2020 compared to our 2006/7 levels. While meeting this target might be challenging, it pushes us to continually look for new ways to improve energy efficiency in our networks.\n\nFor our customers, our Machine-to-Machine (M2M) technologies can enable them to monitor and control devices and systems remotely, saving energy and fuel. With 2.6 billion mobile M2M connections predicted worldwide by 2020, we are confident that this will bring about more eco-efficient companies, further reducing the impact on planet earth.\n\nWith technology at the heart of sustainable business development, not only will companies be doing their part to reduce their carbon footprint, they will also see the business benefits of reducing costs, reaching new markets and ultimately gaining a competitive edge.\n\nArsh Chaudhry\n\nExecutive Managing Director\n\nCushman and Wakefield\n\nBUILDINGS consume 40 per cent of the world's total energy, and nearly 20 per cent of its water and therefore are significant contributors to global climate change.\n\nWith fast paced economic growth and rapid urbanisation across Asia Pacific, the challenge to reduce carbon footprint, while daunting, is even more critical. There needs to be a bigger emphasis on building environmentally sustainable buildings that not only consume less energy and water but also incorporate environmentally sensitive planning, and use efficient building materials.\n\nIn Singapore, the government has taken various proactive measures via the BCA to promote ''Green Mark'' standards and provide incentives for retrofitting and erecting new buildings.\n\nAll new office buildings now have to be Green Mark certified. While they are slightly more costly to build, landlords can expect a payback period of two to eight years on the incremental cost. Green Mark buildings also generally attract better quality tenants, consequently increasing the value of the asset. Therefore not only is this the right thing to do for the environment, it also makes a lot of financial sense!\n\nAt Cushman & Wakefield, not only are we committed to reducing our own carbon footprint, we are also very actively engaged in advising our developer, investor and occupier clients in creating and implementing sustainable strategies.\n\nJohn Keung\n\nCEO\n\nBuilding and Construction Authority\n\nEVERYONE has a role to play in protecting our earth and conserving natural resources. As an urban city-state, Singapore can play a big part in reducing carbon emissions from buildings, especially when our buildings contribute about one third of Singapore's total electricity consumption. Here, BCA successfully led the green building movement with the introduction of the BCA Green Mark scheme in 2005 and the Green Building Masterplan.\n\nWe urge more businesses to work with us and our partner agencies and companies in the built environment sector to play our part in this global mission to help save Planet Earth. To create greater awareness and involve building occupants and users to play their part, BCA has rolled out a number of Green Mark schemes that encourage conscious efforts in adopting more environmentally friendly features and practices.\n\nGoing green for businesses is not just about saving Planet Earth but also about creating a better, healthier environment for employees and the public. For example, the concept of green offices is catching on fast with corporates under our suite of Green Mark schemes which have been helping companies to be green and cost-effective.\n\nAs part of this global mission, we had the opportunity to establish the BCA Centre for Sustainable Buildings (BCA CSB) together with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to spread the green building movement in the region. Collectively, we can do even more to contribute to the global efforts of reducing carbon emissions from buildings around the world.\n\nMark Billington\n\nRegional Director - South-east Asia\n\nICAEW\n\nBUSINESS leaders should focus on how practices can both increase sustainability - for example, by reducing carbon footprint - and improve the bottom line by reducing waste and increasing productivity. In this way they can demonstrate that sustainable behaviour is not a cost but a sound business strategy, aligned with the core interests of both the business and shareholders.\n\nICAEW has worked consistently to reduce its overall carbon footprint - which is recognised by the Carbon Trust Standard, and we were the first accountancy body to do so. Also, one of the challenges in business is the lack of a harmonised approach to valuing and measuring the use of natural resources.\n\nThe Natural Capital Coalition, of which ICAEW is a founding partner, is running a project that aims to produce such a common approach, which would enable better measurement, management, reporting and disclosure of natural capital.\n\nChew Men Leong\n\nChief Executive of PUB\n\nand Executive Director of Environment and Water Industry Programme Office\n\nWATER and energy are major imperatives for green and sustainable cities. PUB's goal is to optimise the complete water cycle by harvesting every drop of rain, recycling every drop of used water more than once and desalinating sea water cost-effectively.\n\nA key focus of our current R&D is to reduce the energy required for all these essential processes. We want to continue exploring these solutions with the private and public sectors through the upcoming Singapore International Water Week, the global platform to share and co-create innovative water solutions.\n\nAlex Caro\n\nChief Technology Officer and Vice-President of Services, Asia Pacific and Japan\n\nAkamai Technologies\n\nAKAMAI made sustainability a part of its core business processes about 10 years ago. For us, this meant relentless innovation in making our cloud platform more efficient every year, and we have had great results. Today, we serve five times the amount of traffic on our network than we did just a few years ago, but our carbon and energy footprints have remained flat.\n\nWe have learned that going green is difficult work! It is neither a project nor a tactic, but rather, a new philosophy of doing business that needs to become part of just about every decision the company makes, from the strategic new businesses we might choose to pursue to the tactical choice of lavatory fixtures for our employee facilities.\n\nThe payoff to this hard work is greater than we expected. We are benefiting from lower costs and better interactions with our increasingly environmentally-conscious customer base, and have also placed the company in a better position for the time when carbon pricing is fully reflected into input costs.\n\nJean-Philippe Filhol\n\nCEO, Asia industrial\n\nVeolia Water Solutions & Technologies\n\nVEOLIA'S business is in full agreement with the Green Cities campaign's vision to evolve cities for a more sustainable future. Focused on combining economic efficiency with control over environmental impacts, Veolia enables businesses to combat climate change, save natural resources, preserve ecosystems, and manage costs all at once.\n\nIt is important for businesses to recognise that sustainability programmes can produce more benefits than the apparent inconveniences and monetary costs involved. By employing solutions like our Carbon Footprint Reduction Programme, companies can quantify emissions, optimise processes, and manage impact.\n\nAlternatively, businesses can use Green2Biz - Veolia's pragmatic approach towards sustainable manufacturing - to achieve cost savings, as well as reduced water and carbon footprints.\n\nPassionate about our work, Veolia will continue to be active in the Green Cities campaign. Our participation in global platforms like Singapore International Water Week (SIWW) affirms our commitment, and we believe more innovations will emerge out of such industry gatherings, encouraging the adoption of sustainability programmes.\n\nHugues Delcourt\n\nCountry Executive\n\nABN AMRO Bank NV Singapore and\n\nCEO of ABN AMRO Private Banking Asia & Middle East\n\nENVIRONMENTAL sustainability is not something that happens overnight; it requires long-term planning and collective effort from all employees. Businesses must prepare for fundamental shifts in mindset, culture and processes if they want to go green. Areas that companies can help reduce carbon footprint is to examine how they can do more with less and deliver their products and services in a more environmentally friendly way.\n\nAt ABN AMRO, our goal is to consume less, operate sustainably and choose responsibly. We are constantly improving our business processes and aim to lower our ecological footprint in energy, mobility, paper, waste and water.\n\nGlobally, we cut our overall energy consumption by 16 per cent last year, thanks in part to a reduction in power use at our data centres. By digitising our processes within the bank, and encouraging clients to opt for digital-only information, we save close to 4 million sheets of paper annually. We also encourage our employees to work wherever and whenever they want using online meetings and web-based video technologies, in order to reduce travel and our carbon footprint.\n\nOther key initiatives in our commodities banking business for example include supporting the activities of the global Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil as a member, and working with our clients in the commodities value chain to promote the growth and use of environmentally sustainable palm oil.\n\nTony Ang\n\nManaging Director\n\nAedas Singapore\n\nAT Aedas, we are committed to the environmental, socio-economic and cultural sustainability of the communities and places we design for and have developed a comprehensive design approach to reduce carbon footprint. Drawing on our global experience, research and best practice knowledge, our sustainability teams have created an in-house analysis tool: the Integrated Design Environment by Aedas Sustainability (IDEAS Box). This enables our global design teams to assess lifecycle impacts of design solutions, construction techniques and material choice.\n\nAedas has pursued a holistic approach towards creating low-carbon sustainable designs with the use of the latest modelling and simulation software and this has translated into achieving green building certifications for a number of our designs. We are also driven to continually develop our green policy and practices to stimulate long-term sustainability in our built environment.\n\nPeter Dew\n\nPresident, Asia Pacific\n\nCEVA Logistics\n\nSOCIAL responsibility needs to be a part of every organisation's culture where there is a constant, genuine effort to explore innovative approaches in the way we operate to improve sustainability. Having stakeholders aligned, from customers, suppliers to employees, is important. In CEVA's annual survey, more than half of our customers indicated their companies look at environmental sustainability as one of the key considerations when selecting a logistics provider.\n\nAs a global supply chain company, we are in a unique position to effect changes for the better, to support our customers with initiatives that will unlock the waste in their supply chain and further their efforts to be socially responsible. Our commitment to sustainability permeates the way we do business, from warehousing operations to transportation, solution design to procurement policy.\n\nAlick Chia\n\nDirector, Business Support\n\nSKF Asia Pacific Pte Ltd\n\nSKF is a Swedish MNC. It has strong beliefs about the need to protect the environment. Our Environmental Care programme focuses on the group responsibility to continually strive to reduce the negative impact on the environment from its own operations and those of its suppliers. SKF's BeyondZero programme combines that with a strategy to improve customers' environmental performance through products and solutions that improve energy efficiency.\n\nTo SKF, this means that every stage in the value chain presents the possibility to reduce environmental impact. SKF has been building on these foundations by continually taking steps which address the environmental impacts at different stages of the product life cycle and the entire value chain of the business. SKF's climate strategy also addresses all the significant greenhouse gas impacts across the life cycle and value chain of our products and solutions.\n\nSKF has participated in the United Nations Global Compact since 2006 and is committed to the defined principles. SKF's climate strategy was recognised by WWF as being the best in class in its industry.\n\nLeong Yee May\n\nSenior Vice-President\n\nOrange Business Services Asia Pacific\n\nOVER the last two decades, energy needed for IT equipment has increased tenfold, and energy costs are expected to rise by a third come 2016. Recent UN estimates have also found that the smart use of information and communication technologies (ICT) could reduce global CO2 emissions by 15 per cent a year by 2020, with only a small increase in ICT's own emissions. As major energy consumers and greenhouse gas emitters, these findings give businesses greater incentive to adopt green IT practices.\n\nTo go green, organisations should consider adopting strategies such as regularly de-cluttering their network, monitoring energy consumption, consolidating server rooms and data centres, and replacing inefficient hardware. Apart from organisation-scale changes, facilities can also practise nightly shutdowns, which can generate up to 40 per cent energy savings. With a concerted IT energy management policy, a business running 2,800 desktops can potentially expect 60 per cent in energy cost savings.\n\nReducing carbon footprint has been a priority for Orange, and the global mission to save Planet Earth has strengthened our conservation culture and efforts. However, in achieving meaningful results, the IT industry needs to look beyond minimising the impact of our own operations. Recent studies have also found that adopting green ICT has the potential to reduce global carbon emissions even with the rise in demand for IT equipment. As the industry seeks to be more environmentally responsible, it cannot work in silos, but step up and play an active role in helping other industries go green.\n\nToby Koh\n\nGroup Managing Director\n\nAdemco Security Group\n\nWE saved thirty 40-foot trees last year. Ademco is on a cloud-based software infrastructure and have cut down sharply on paper usage over the last couple of years. Deploying cloud technology allows our engineers to work anywhere and everywhere with their tablets and laptops. Service reports are now done on the tablet instead of the traditional carbon paper, and e-mailed to our clients.\n\nWe are also helping clients reduce electricity wastage by monitoring the number of people in their premises and moderating the aircon temperature on a dynamic basis rather than the traditional reactive basis. Our clients use our integrated security platform to help manage lighting usage only as needed. Until such time when humans are highly conscious and actively going green, it is probably best to leverage on technology to do so.\n\nRichard Hong\n\nCEO\n\nT\u00dcV S\u00dcD Asean\n\nIT is reported that CO2 concentration in our atmosphere is now 40 per cent higher than pre-industrial times. This drastic increase is due to industrialisation and human activities such as burning fossil fuels. To go green, businesses in Singapore must focus on all types of gases under their carbon footprint (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide etc). Our main carbon emission is energy consumption.\n\nTo mitigate impact on global warming, businesses in Singapore can adopt international management systems such as ISO50001 and ISO14064. These standards enable businesses to adopt best practices and when supported by top management commitment, increases energy cost savings. SMEs in Singapore can benefit from SPRING Singapore grants when they implement initiatives to reduce their operations' carbon footprints, such as using energy efficient lighting, optimising chillers, up-taking clean fuel technologies and so on.\n\nAt T\u00dcV S\u00dcD, our mission is to share our know-how for such best practices. As part of our CSR programme, we are collaborating with developmental banks and governments to organise awareness sessions to help businesses implement emission reduction and energy efficiency projects in Asean.\n\nWong Heng Chew\n\nPresident\n\nFujitsu Singapore\n\nBUSINESSES can take the first step to going green by starting with their offices and daily operations. Internally, we provided our employees with Fujitsu mugs to reduce the use of paper cups. We also constantly remind staff to not print unnecessarily. To reduce electricity consumption, we encourage switching the lights off during lunch hours and installed a lighting mapping manager to ensure that lights are switched on at areas only when needed.\n\nFujitsu also commits time to preserving the environment through the Fujitsu Tropical Rainforest Regeneration Project. Last year, our employees volunteered their time to plant seedlings at the Fujitsu Eco-Forest Park in Borneo, Malaysia, to help restore the lushness of the tropical rainforest.\n\nGoing green requires a conscious effort. In all our Research & Development work, we remain committed to reducing environmental burden throughout our entire innovation development lifecycle, right from the initial policy formulation stages. Across all our innovations, we constantly strive to create technologies that contribute to saving energy.\n\nExternally, we help our customers go green by leveraging new technologies that minimise energy consumption and carbon emissions. Not only are these technologies environmentally friendly, they help cut down on operating costs, making it a win-win situation for both businesses and Planet Earth.\n\nHaider Rashid\n\nCountry President Singapore & Region President South Asia\n\nABB Pte Ltd\n\nABB's mantra of 'Power and Productivity for a Better World' is more than just a description of our business, it is a reflection of our commitment to creating a better, more sustainable world where products, services and behaviours are perfectly aligned.\n\nIn Singapore, we continually strive towards becoming more environmentally conscious. Some ways in which we've already succeeded are in promoting recycling among our employees, recycling rainwater for our washrooms and to water the plants, and keeping all air-conditioning units at a pleasant 24 degrees Celsius. At our facility in Tuas, we've just installed a solar farm of 1026 panels, which will help reduce CO2 emissions by around 320 tonnes a year, which is the emissions equivalent of 160 cars.\n\nOn a global level, a large proportion of revenues we generate as a company come from products that help our customers to reduce their carbon footprint, whether it's our variable speed drives that help industries reduce their energy consumption, our HVDC (high voltage direct current) technology that enables electricity to be transmitted efficiently, or our technology solutions for the wind and solar industries. ABB is also at the forefront of electric mobility, with our technologies being used extensively to power electric trains, buses and cars.\n\nAs a company, we are still discovering new ways, both large and small, to reduce our carbon footprint and we feel that any company could do the same to save energy or to use it more efficiently.\n\nJanet Ang\n\nManaging Director\n\nIBM Singapore\n\nSUSTAINABILITY is no longer an option. Being smart about sustainability - particularly with buildings and physical infrastructures - is an imperative as buildings consume 42 per cent of all electricity and is fast becoming the largest emitter of greenhouse gases.\n\nAmong them are the many data centres that are powering the digital transformation of businesses and industries. Their number will only grow when you consider that CEOs, in an IBM study, rank technology as the No 1 factor impacting businesses.\n\nFrom IBM's own experience, we are demonstrating to businesses that opportunities for ''green'' and ''smart'' are endless. At new data centres, smarter design and management components using predictive analytics are delivering Power-Usage-Effectiveness (PUE) rating of just 1.5, much lower than the industry average of 2.39.\n\nOne of the world's greenest supercomputers made by IBM can be found in the Nanyang Technological University's High Performance Computing (HPC) Centre, which was built to support complex research projects.\n\nHerbert Vongpusanachai\n\nSenior Vice-President & Managing Director\n\nDHL Express Singapore\n\nAS the world's largest logistics service provider, DHL has a responsibility to minimise the impact of our business on the environment and to ensure sustainable development. By 2020, we aim to improve our carbon efficiency by 30 per cent compared to the 2007 baseline.\n\nBusinesses should adopt environmental protection programmes such as DHL's GOGREEN, a global initiative integrated deeply with the corporate strategy, to drive their green initiatives both internally and externally. In addition to changing the way we do business, we have been actively engaging our employees to increase their awareness of environmental issues, encouraging mindset and behavioural changes.\n\nExternally, as our customers become increasingly aware of the role they must play to protect the environment, DHL also acts as an enabler to help them keep track of their carbon footprint, which in turn allows businesses to make informed decisions towards more sustainable growth. Our GOGREEN CARBON NEUTRAL service, an environmentally responsible shipping solution, helps companies combat climate change by offsetting emissions from the transportation of their shipments.\n\nChris Comer\n\nCEO and Property Developer\n\nCastlewood Group\n\nMINIMISE waste and maximise recycling are two easy avenues through which businesses can make a difference. The enormity of the task globally discourages many from going green as they consider their contribution as being ''a drop in the ocean''; but harnessed and employed by all, altering the mindset to more green thinking would of course make a significant difference.\n\nWithin Castlewood Group we are conscious of our carbon footprint especially in the areas of lighting, heating and cooling. When we became aware of the significant differences that minor adjustments can make, we embarked on a company-wide Go Green campaign. We encourage the use of fans rather than constantly relying upon air conditioning. Aside from the savings in energy and costs, ceiling and desk fans, consuming less than 5 per cent of the energy required to power an air conditioning unit, are less harmful to the health of our employees. We recycle as much as possible; we avoid unnecessary printing of e-mail and other documents, working practically paper-free.\n\nWe are currently considering switching all of our lighting to LED, with eco-energy efficiency initiatives as the stimulus. And employee health plays a part again as the LED lighting provides a flicker-free lighting environment, a brighter light, and a happier healthier workforce is less prone to absence on medical grounds. Overall, our experience of going green has been very good, and from far more aspects than one might have originally considered.\n\nPaul Endacott\n\nManaging Director, SEA\n\nAmbition Group Ltd\n\nTHERE are many ways in which businesses can reduce their carbon footprint. They can use more eco-friendly office buildings or implement internal processes towards green outcomes. At Ambition we encourage our employees to play an active role in this drive, by recycling papers, not printing unnecessarily, and shutting down computers and ensuring all the lights are out before leaving the office.\n\nAt Ambition our purpose is to Build Better Futures, and this doesn't just apply to our candidates, clients and employees. We have a wider responsibility to the environment for future generations and that is part of what it means to be Green.\n\nDora Hoan\n\nCo-Chairman/Group CEO\n\nBest World International Ltd\n\nBUSINESSES can go green by monitoring energy consumption and resource management. Using energy-saving air conditioners and environmentally-friendly resources will be helpful; these are a win-win solution that helps reduce carbon footprint while increasing cost savings for the businesses. With collective action, these small ways can be significant.\n\nThanks to the global call to protect the environment, there is a greater possibility of such collective effort to create a sustainable living environment. My company has already implemented a structured approach for this purpose. We are using energy-saving air conditioners as well as flexible modular office systems that are recyclable at the end of useful life. We also strive to reduce our use of paper and plastic bags. We will continue to do our best for a greener environment.\n\nDavid Low\n\nCEO\n\nFuturistic Store Fixtures Pte Ltd\n\nWITH businesses going global comes a greater number of miles covered in terms of sales reach and deliveries. Apart from best building practices, logistics play a big part in the green factor. It is a delicate balance, and even a challenge, to calibrate costs savings while minimising carbon footprint.\n\nSourcing locally may not offer the best savings but definitely helps to reduce carbon footprint, and shipping deliveries across the world is necessary for businesses in international trade yet it adds to carbon emissions. Preserving the environment is no longer just a simple effort but a strategic move that directly impacts the bottom line.\n\nAs a store fixtures specialist that uses MDF board as core material, we have our manufacturing facilities certified by FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) in an attempt to preserve the source forests. Serving a portfolio of renowned retail clients that are themselves green-conscious has spurred us to develop green initiatives as part of our corporate social responsibility.\n\nThese initiatives are upfront investments which may be accounted as costs in the short run, including remodelling of heaters to run on natural gas instead of diesel; engaging a waste management company to recycle and reuse materials; refurbishing a waste water treatment plant to effectively manage toxic waste; reusing wood cutoffs to construct pallets for use. These directives have added to costs of operations in absolute terms but we are certain the returns in the long run will be far more tangible in many aspects, including corporate goodwill.\n\nSam Yap\n\nGroup Executive Chairman and Co-Founder\n\nHtwo Investment Holdings Pte Ltd\n\nONE of the Corporate Social Responsibility values adopted by our company is to be environmental-friendly, go for green practices and reiterate these values in our day to day activities, as well as incorporating such concepts in the teaching curriculum of our centres and schools. We believe even small steps towards being ''green'' can lead to an overall better environment for all.\n\nIn Htwo Holdings and in all our subsidiaries, the concept of being environmental-friendly is well ingrained in and embraced by employees. Efforts are made by all levels of staff to reduce wastage in resources like being prudent in printing of documents and to switch off equipment after use. Gentle reminders and small posters are put up at strategic points within the workplace to highlight good green practices to employees.\n\nThe curriculum of all our pre-schools, enrichment and tuition centres include teaching children the importance of protecting the environment and sustaining it for future generations. The children under our care and tutelage learn all about recycling of materials.\n\nPublic education on going green must continue and be stepped up. At a higher and policy level, some strong direction and efforts on this matter must be introduced and implemented for all to understand the implications of going green.\n\nChristophe Duchatellier\n\nCEO\n\nAdecco Asia\n\nTHE growing threat of climate change poses ever greater challenges and opportunities to businesses across industries. As organisations move towards a greener way of working, they should encourage their employees and clients to be consistent in their values and actions. They may also demonstrate leadership on the awareness of global environmental issues. Engage, and do so with integrity and purpose, because creating a sustainable culture and community within the workplace begins with an organic development of sustainable efforts within the organisation.\n\nAt Adecco, we encourage our employees to find ways for possible solutions to the threat of climate change. In line with our green efforts, the Paper Free initiative across Adecco Asia encourages employees to be creative before hitting the 'Print' button too quickly, in turn reducing our carbon footprint.\n\nVinod Agnihotri\n\nVice-President,\n\nMaterial Protection Products business unit\n\nLANXESS Pte Ltd\n\nThe challenges facing municipal infrastructures are constantly evolving as cities expand. One of these is the question of how steadily-growing urban conurbations can thrive in an environment worth living in considering that city populations worldwide are growing by two people every second. Since cities only occupy two per cent of the space available worldwide, yet consume two-thirds of our planet's available resources, sustainable solutions are becoming ever more important.\n\nThe chemical industry has played a significant role in driving this global urbanisation megatrend for many years. As a manufacturer of products which go into building cities of the future, LANXESS is committed not only to practising climate and resource-friendly production methods, as well as investing in modern processes to keep air, soil and water clean, but also to realise innovative products that help significantly to improve urban living.\n\nSaulo Spaolanse\n\nCountry President\n\nSchneider Electric Singapore and Brunei\n\nOne of the easiest ways to start reducing your carbon footprint is to understand how you use energy. Today, technologies such as smart energy meters and management systems provide real-time energy consumption data, allowing us to immediately start taking energy-saving measures.\n\nAs a leader in energy management, Schneider Electric works with more than 200 cities around the world to help them achieve up to 30% energy savings and 15% reduction in water losses with our solutions and services. We've done the same for our global headquarters in Paris, whose energy consumption has been reduced by roughly 60% compared to our previous headquarters. With energy replacing water as a critical vulnerability in Singapore, the government has set up a progressive framework to make energy use more efficient. In response, we are working closely with our customers to monitor and manage their energy efficiencies to meet Green Mark standards.\n\nAt Schneider Electric, we believe that going green requires a holistic approach to managing resources and facilities, anchored in continuous improvement, and enabled via monitoring and feedback. In the long run, understanding the life cycles of our resources and facilities allows us to optimise costs and plan for consistent performance, leaving room for innovation and improvement.\n\nWe've had 41 successful years in Singapore now, being involved in smart, sustainable and energy-efficient nation-building projects and we look forward to another 41 of helping Singapore to go green!\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Higher deposits from current and savings account led to a 9.7 per cent rise in customer deposits to $216.6 billion. Loan to deposit ratio stood at 85.5 per cent as at end March 2014.\n\nNet interest income grew 15.2 per cent to $1.11 billion while net interest margin improved three basis points to 1.73 per cent but slipped one basis point from a quarter ago.\n\nNon-interest income slipped 9.3 per cent to $642 million from a year back. This was led by an 8.6 per cent drop in fee and commission income to $414 million owing to lower loan processing and fund management fees which was partly offset by higher fee income from wealth management.\n\nTrading and investment income also fell 5.5 per cent on the back of lower gains from sale of securities and trading income.\n\nNoteworthy is that overseas profit before tax contribution for the period stood at 46.2 per cent, higher than the comparative quarters.\n\nMr Wee added that UOB will continue to monitor developments in key regional markets on the back of the United States' stimulus tapering and as Asian economies moderate.\n\nUOB shares gained 58 cents, or 2.7 per cent, to finish the day at $21.76 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Such a deal would have injected momentum into the delayed 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact.\n\nMr Najib's desire to bring Malaysia into Mr Obama's flagship trade plan has been undercut by the resurgent influence of traditionalists within his own ruling party following a weak election showing last year.\n\nEarly this month, a Malaysian cabinet minister was reported as saying the country was a long way from being able to sign a TPP deal and that the priority should be on economic integration within the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean) bloc.\n\nMr Najib said Malaysia was committed to free trade and denied that Washington was \"bullying\" the South-east Asian nation into joining the controversial pact. \"We are working around the sensitivities and challenges which I alluded to in my discussions with President Obama,\" Mr Najib told a joint news conference with the US leader in the administrative capital Putrajaya. \"He fully understands our domestic sensitivities and we will sit down and try to iron this out with the intention of trying to work out a deal in the near future.\"\n\nMr Najib announced that he had agreed with Mr Obama to upgrade the two countries' ties to a \"comprehensive partnership,\" mirroring a step that Malaysia took with China last year when President Xi Jinping made a state visit. \"This marks a new phase in our relationship, with greater collaboration in economy, security, education, science, technology and more,\" Mr Najib said.\n\nMr Obama said domestic opposition to trade deals was not surprising and that the United States was willing to be flexible on particularly sensitive areas, such as prices of life-saving medicines that critics say will jump in countries like Malaysia under the TPP. \"There's never been a trade deal in which somebody's not going to at some point object because they're fearful of the future or they're invested in the status quo,\" Mr Obama said.\n\nThe challenge for Mr Obama during his week-long, four-nation regional tour is to convince Asian partners that Washington is serious about its promised strategic \"pivot\" to increase US influence in Asia, without harming US ties with China, the world's second-biggest economy and a growing maritime power.\n\nIn his town hall speech in Malaysia, the Hawaiian-born president, who lived in Indonesia as a boy, told his audience that the US has long had connections across the Pacific as well as the Atlantic.\n\nHe told students he plans to meet every year with the leaders of the 10-member Asean, and would work through the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to build trade ties. \"We want to work with old allies and worthy partners and with China,\" he said. \"We want to see a peaceful rise to China.\"\n\nWhen asked why he would not be meeting opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim on his visit, Mr Obama said it was \"not indicative of a lack of concern\" and that Malaysia had \"work to do\" on allowing more freedoms.\n\nMr Najib said he was committed to the rule of law and civil liberties, but added that he had to take into account complex racial sensitivities in the multi-ethnic nation of 29 million people. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Under Basel III, the bank's preference shares issued before Jan 1, 2013, no longer fully qualify as Tier-1 capital.\n\nThe bank decided to retire only the institutional tranche but not the retail one because that would affect \"too many mums and pops\", said Mr Gupta.\n\nThe pay hike of DBS chairman Peter Seah was also questioned. Mr Seah, absent from the meeting as he is in hospital following a bicycle accident, earned $1.84 million last year, up from $1 million in 2012.\n\nMr Sabnani said Mr Seah's position was a non-executive one; he only gives guidance to the group but it is the management team led by Mr Gupta which does the work.\n\nHe added that the local banks also get guidance from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, which will not let them fail. Local banks thus operate in a \"cloistered\" environment, even as they face competition from foreign banks.\n\nThe board had recommended bringing the chairman's pay closer to industry norms.\n\nChristoper Cheong, DBS shareholder and committee member of Securities Investors Association Singapore, countered Mr Sabnani with a passionate defence of Mr Seah's banking experience, ability and time spent in guiding DBS.\n\nThe resolution on directors' fees was passed with more than 32 per cent voting against.\n\nAll other resolutions were passed with overwhelming \"for\" votes of between 91 and 99 per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A massive hunt for the Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 in the southern Indian Ocean has so far yielded nothing on the surface or below, baffling authorities who are struggling to explain the loss of the aircraft.\n\n\"I regret to say that thus far, none of our efforts in the air, on the surface, or undersea have found any wreckage,\" Tony Abbott said. \"It is highly unlikely at this stage that we will find any aircraft debris on the ocean surface,\" he added, noting that a surface area of more than 4.5 million sq km had been scanned. \"By this stage, 52 days into the search, most material would have become water logged and sunk.\"\n\nFlight MH370 disappeared on March 8 carrying 239 people, and is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean off west Australia after mysteriously diverting from its Kuala Lumpur to Beijing journey. Mr Abbott said that the search would now enter a new phase that would involve undersea efforts being ramped up, with authorities scouring the ocean floor over an area of nearly 60,000 sq km. \"If necessary, of the entire probable impact zone which is roughly 700 km by 80 km,\" he said when asked when asked about the extent of the search area.\n\nMr Abbott said the Australian government, in consultation with Malaysian authorities, was willing to engage one or more commercial companies to undertake this work which he estimated would cost some A$60 million (S$69.9 million) and take six to eight months. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Debbie Yong and Georgine Verano get behind the plot.\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 25, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHEY'VE helped corporate diners and private hosts put together dinner with a tale for the past three years. Now, Crystal Chua and Stephan Zoisl of private dining outfit My Private Chef want to tell some stories of their own too. In June, they will launch Stories, a series of theatrical pop-up dinners based on historical events and iconic sites in Singapore.\n\n\"Stories combines my love for food and my interest in local monuments and history - and conveying them through fine food and wine,\" says Ms Chua, 39.\n\nAt their first dinner to be held on June 26-29 at the Tanjong Pagar Railway Station, up to 180 diners will be regaled with retellings of the building's illustrious past while seated for a five-course fine-dining meal.\n\nThe Fat Duck-trained Zoisl, 33, was previously executive chef of modern European restaurant Novus, and he will send out edible creations crafted to the theme, such as wedges of cod coated in squid ink to resemble the coal pieces prevalent in the station during its heyday.\n\nSpoilt by a penchant for travel, global media exposure and a never-ending onslaught of great restaurants in Singapore, local diners have become a difficult bunch to impress, Ms Chua admits. Hence, a story-based theatrical dining experience would help satiate adventurous diners seeking the unusual. \"Our Singapore story may not go back thousands of years like China or Europe, but I would still love to celebrate whatever we have. Few nations can achieve what we have in the last 50 years with what we've got,\" she says.\n\nStories is also one of the events to benefit from the Singapore Tourism Board's Kickstart Fund, a $5 million pot launched last June to develop new lifestyle events and concepts with tourism potential.\n\nThough the first two chapters of the pop-up dinner series will be set in national monuments key to the history of Singapore, Stories could eventually grow to work in other narratives around iconic events or history that interest diners here. Other Singapore-based chefs will also be roped in for future meals, though \"they must not only be creative, but must live or have lived in Singapore long enough to appreciate Singapore heritage and food culture\", she says.\n\nThe venue for Stories' second instalment in November will be announced in July, while details for future chapters are still being penned.\n\nBy Debbie Yong\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A decomposition of Singapore's trade data shows that over the past decade, services exports nearly quadrupled, buoyed by demand for financial services, business services and tourism,\" it added.\n\nA comparison with regional competitors showed that Singapore's comparative advantage in the past decade has been in the provision of \"modern services\", which encompasses financial, telecoms, computer and information and other business services.\n\nThe acceleration of net investment commitments and foreign direct investment in Singapore's services sector further signals the rising importance of these activities here.\n\nThe Review said that between 2007 and last year, investment commitments in services surged 28 per cent per annum on average.\n\nAmong the regional economies, Singapore is one of the most oriented towards global demand for financial and business services. The Republic is ranked first, going by its share of global exports of financial services, and fourth for business services.\n\nThe ranking compared Singapore with China, India, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea and the Asean-4 countries of Indonesia, Malaysian, Thailand and the Philippines.\n\nThe Review said: \"Singapore's competitiveness in business services stems largely from its attractiveness as a location for regional headquarters, while the financial services sector is anchored by many globally competitive clusters, including the fund management industry.\"\n\nMultinational companies are realigning their business operations to focus on delivering services that complement the goods they produce.\n\n\"In fact, the shift towards a more services- based manufacturing sector is likely to accelerate in the coming years, due to the higher profit potential of such activities,\" said the Review.\n\nThe Global Service and Parts Management Benchmark Survey by Deloitte Research, which polled more than 120 global manufacturers across the world, found that services accounted for almost half their profits, despite accounting for only a quarter of total revenues.\n\nThe global trend of servicisation has made an impact on manufacturing companies located in Singapore, especially IT-related producers.\n\n\"A breakdown of global revenues by the largest electronics firms in Singapore reveals that the share of total revenues accounted for by services-related activities rose from 48 per cent in 2007 to 55 per cent in 2013.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He then spent the next few years at a colleague's consumer products business, designing portable battery-operated lantern products that became commercially successful.\n\nIn 1984, he struck out on his own, setting up a clock and watch manufacturer with a few friends. He had the capital because he invested his savings of HK$150,000 in the stock market, growing it to HK$1 million in four years.\n\n\"Most people in the stock market speculate. But I didn't speculate, I invested in good stocks which you had to do homework for two to three hours every night to find out,\" he said.\n\nCrystal Jade itself began in 1991 as an obscure restaurant in the now-defunct Cairnhill Hotel. It was set up by Alfred Leung, Mr Ip's brother-in-law. The restaurant had a following but was financially troubled.\n\nMr Ip, a loyal customer, was roped in to help in 1992. He invested HK$10 million in the business, or around $2 million then. Around the same time as his Crystal Jade investment, the classical music fan also started a piano manufacturing business in China - a business he is in the process of selling.\n\nAfter Mr Ip's investment, Crystal Jade became profitable within a few years. In 2001, the restaurant went regional, opening outlets in Vietnam and Hong Kong. The following year, it was in China.\n\nBy 2003, the group's annual revenues had grown to $100 million from $3.6 million in 1992. But the Sars crisis hit and people were afraid to come out to eat. Revenues plunged. If the crisis had continued for one or two more months, Crystal Jade would have folded, Mr Ip said.\n\nThe next year, more drama came. Amid reported \"issues\" and \"differences in philosophy\", Mr Leung left the group in mid-2004 to start arch-rival Imperial Treasure. Mr Leung's brothers Jimmy and Vincent, who held senior executive positions, had also left.\n\nCrystal Jade nevertheless went on from strength to strength. In 2005, it opened its first restaurant in Seoul and also set up branches in major shopping malls in Kuala Lumpur. It had expanded to Bangkok the year before.\n\nIn 2007, Crystal Jade opened outlets in Indonesia and Japan. Mr Ip was awarded the Rotary-Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (Asme) Entrepreneur of the Year award in 2009. In 2010, the first outlet in Manila opened. Earlier this year, Crystal Jade debuted in India.\n\nMr Ip has several ideas on what he wants to do in his retirement. He lights up when talking about sustainability and environment initiatives, such as preventing overfishing or helping those living in remote areas tap solar energy instead of relying on wood-burning.\n\n\"People are taking too much from the world,\" he said. \"On Saturday, Sunday, I always go to the wet market (in Hong Kong) to buy food for myself and for the family. I can find fewer and fewer fish, their prices are getting higher, species are going extinct.\"\n\nAt home, he is a doting father to his 21-year-old daughter -- his only child -- and cooks for her. But when asked what motivated him in all his years as an entrepreneur, Mr Ip is all steel.\n\n\"I enjoy the feeling of success.

They are typically the ground or basement level of a retail mall that is linked to a bus interchange or an MRT station.\n\nPrime spaces are limited and still highly sought after by retailers because the revenue per sq ft for such spaces tends to be higher, Ms Tan said. Retailers coping with rising manpower costs may downsize their retail space but still keep prime retail spaces that generate better sales.\n\nEarly strains in retail rents surfaced in a URA data that showed a marginal 0.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter decline in the rental index for the Central Region, which covers the core downtown area and city fringe areas such as Paya Lebar and the Holland Road area.\n\nThe dip was due mainly to new supply during the quarter, which translated into higher vacancies. Though some retailers said they have not benefited from the potential easing, more retail space is underway.\n\nSome 4.1 million sq ft of new retail spaceis expected to come onstream in the next four years, of which 45 per cent of the total net lettable area will be completed in 2014, Knight Frank estimates.\n\nThe upcoming retail supply this year will mostly be smaller retail malls or mixed commercial developments that will be evenly spread across Singapore.\n\nLast quarter, malls that went through asset enhancement initiatives (AEIs) have enjoyed improved rentals, Knight Frank says. Major retail malls Suntec City and Marina Square continued to register rental growth of between 10 and 20 per cent for prime spaces as a result of AEIs.\n\nThe average retail rents for prime spaces in Jurong East came in surprisingly strong at $32.50 psf, surpassing the average prime rents of $32.30 psf for suburban malls across Singapore. But not all the malls in the Jurong cluster held firm. Some of the newer malls are still undergoing operational issues or face competition from the existing malls, Knight Frank says.\n\nJurong East has been mooted as one of the possible locations for the terminal of the proposed high-speed rail (HSR) link between Singapore and Malaysia. Should the HSR station be located there, it may stimulate an increase in demand from retailers for malls in Jurong, especially Jurong East, the report says.\n\nKnight Frank foresees that other developments in the city area such as Capitol Singapore, an integrated development that will include a four-storey upmarket retail mall, will add vibrancy to the City Hall area and the Civic District when it opens by the end of this year.\n\nView the full report by Knight Frank at\n\nwww.btinvest.com.sg\n\n.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In 2011, it shelved a proposed IPO in Singapore reportedly because of market volatility.\n\nOf the estimated US$142 million investment, the bulk of it (US$100 million) will be used for its five-year expansion programme.\n\nThe programme aims to grow Fitness First's footprint in Asia by about 60 per cent. By 2018, 50 new outlets across Asia are slated to open, and membership is expected to increase by almost two-thirds, to more than 350,000 people.\n\nThe remaining US$42 million will be used to upgrade its existing outlets. US$30 million will fund new technology, equipment and club design while the rest (US$12 million) will go to staff training and marketing.\n\nIn Singapore, it operates 16 clubs.\n\nSimon Flint, chief executive officer of Fitness First Asia said: \"Singapore is one of our most buoyant markets.\" This may explain the surge in the company's total investment in its outlets islandwide - from US$2.4 million in FY2013 to US$15.2 million in FY2014.\n\nAccording to Mr Flint, up to 30 of the 50 new outlets to be opened in Asia by 2018 will be situated in Singapore. The outlets in Singapore will be further spread out islandwide, from the heartlands to the Central Business District.\n\nFitness First estimates that less than 5 per cent of the South-east Asian population are members of a health and fitness club. The prospects for Asia remain bright as the region offers \"a growing market with current low penetration\".\n\nMr Flint said: \"Current trading in Asia is strong with revenue growth of 12 per cent year to date, making us increasingly confident about the future.\"\n\nFitness First Asia reported strong growth for FY2013. In the 12 months to Oct 31, 2013, revenue was up 9.8 per cent at US$212.3 million. Adjusted operating profit was up 14.5 per cent at US$32 million.\n\nBeyond the Asian countries in which it has already established itself, Fitness First is open to the possibility of venturing into China.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There has been speculation of Wilmar launching a takeover bid since it took a 10.1 per cent stake in Goodman Fielder in 2011.\n\nOne reason Wilmar has chosen to act now could be that it has found a right partner in First Pacific, said OCBC analyst Carey Wong, who added that \"there (has been) a spate of interest in the agri sector lately, and they may be hoping to get into the action before it's too late\".\n\nThe deal would enable Goodman Fielder to become \"a leading pan-Asian player\", said Morgan Stanley analysts Charles Spencer and Mean Chong.\n\nWilmar has about 50 per cent market share in China's consumer pack edible oils, while Jakarta-based PT Indofood Sukses Makmur, a controlling shareholder of IndoAgri that is itself 50.1 per cent owned by First Pacific, has a 75 per cent share in the branded noodles market in Indonesia.\n\n\"There appears to be the potential for GF's branded products to leverage on this powerful pan-Asian market share,\" they said.\n\nGoodman Fielder is listed in Australia and New Zealand, and will be delisted from both markets if the offer succeeds.\n\nWilmar and First Pacific have requested access to Goodman Fielder's management and company information to conduct a due-diligence exercise that would take about four weeks.\n\nWilmar said that it intended to fund its share of the cost of acquisition from existing cash resources and bank facilities.\n\nWilmar's shares ended two cents lower at $3.49 yesterday, while First Pacific fell three Hong Kong cents to HK$8.47.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

To one of hedge-fund operator Citadel's top executives, small investors have never been more fortunate.\n\n\"It's one of the few markets in the world where the little guy gets a better deal than the big guy,\" Jamil Nazarali, the head of Citadel Execution Services, said on Monday during a panel discussion at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California. \"Things are much better today than they were 10 to 15 years ago.\"\n\nThe publication of Lewis's Flash Boys has sparked a month of debate over whether, following more than a decade of regulatory and technological changes, the US$22 trillion American equity market is fairly structured. Citadel's role in that discussion stems from Mr Nazarali's unit, which pays brokerages including TD Ameritrade Holding for the right to execute orders placed by their customers, who tend to be individuals.\n\nLewis critiqued that practice, known as payment for order flow. Citadel's rivals in that business include Citigroup, UBS and KCG Holdings. All are bound by rules meant to ensure they get the best price possible for investors.\n\nMr Nazarali said on Monday that small investors often get better prices for their trades than the biggest firms.\n\nThat's not fair, according to Seth Merrin, whose Liquidnet Holdings pitches its dark pools as havens for institutions to buy and sell large blocks of shares.\n\n\"If you are going to buy in bulk, you should get a better price than someone buying retail,\" Liquidnet chief executive officer Mr Merrin said during a panel discussion with Mr Nazarali. Giving the smallest investors a better deal than the biggest investors is \"screwed up\", he said.\n\nMr Merrin isn't alone in arguing that large investors aren't adequately served by the market's current structure. Fidelity Investments, the second-largest mutual fund company, is exploring the creation of a US stock trading venue along with other investors.\n\nThe venture under consideration would aim to \"address today's market structure, and provide higher levels of transparency, liquidity and control for the benefit of all fund shareholders,\" Vincent Loporchio, a senior vice-president at Fidelity, wrote in an e-mail on April 10.\n\nIEX Group has created its own platform designed to blunt advantages its founders believe the fastest trading firms enjoy. Its shareholders include some of the world's biggest investors, including David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, Capital Group and Brandes Investment Partners.\n\nIEX's CEO, Brad Katsuyama, served as one of the heroes in Flash Boys. A day after the book was published, he engaged in a heated debate on CNBC with Bats Global Markets president Bill O'Brien, whose firm's exchanges were criticised by Lewis.\n\nAsked how to improve the perception among investors that the equity market is broken, Citadel's Mr Nazarali said on Monday that more cohesion is needed.\n\n\"The most important thing that the market can do is stop the food fight where everyone is pointing fingers at everyone else,\" he said.\n\nTD Ameritrade's CEO, Fred Tomczyk, agreed that small investors are well-served by equity markets.\n\n\"The retail investor today is better off than they have been in history,\" he said during the Milken conference panel. There is \"a lot of noise around Michael Lewis's book\", he added. \"We have 6.1 million customers. We've had 70 phone calls\" regarding the accusations in the book, he said. \"This is a lot more of a Wall Street issue than a Main Street issue.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": []}

Buyers outweighed sellers with 12 companies that recorded 23 purchases worth $1.43 million versus two firms with six disposals worth $0.94 million. The buy figures were sharply up from the previous week's four-day totals of five companies, six purchases, and $0.50 million.

The figures were sharply down from the previous week's five companies, 16 trades and $3.53 million.\n\nThe surge in the insider buying last week was due to purchases by non-executive director Hiew Yoon Khong in real estate investment trusts Mapletree Commercial Trust (MCT), Mapletree Industrial Trust (MIT), Mapletree Logistics Trust (MLT) and Mapletree Greater China Commercial Trust (MGCCT). The acquisitions were made following the announcement of year-end results.

Core net profit at DBS Bank climbed 9 per cent to $1.03 billion; including one-off items, it was up 30 per cent to $1.23 billion. United Overseas Bank (UOB) said net profit rose 9.2 per cent to $788 million.\n\nThe fact that the robust performance happened in a quarter of challenging fixed income markets, which has caused some global banks to stumble, was particularly sweet.\n\nBank stocks rose on the results. Leading the pack was UOB which rose almost 3 per cent, before easing to end up 2.7 per cent. OCBC shares gained a more modest 1.9 per cent while DBS was up 0.6 per cent.\n\nSaid DBS chief executive Piyush Gupta: \"DBS has had a very solid start to the year. Despite challenging fixed income markets, quarterly earnings crossed the $1 billion mark for the first time, a testament to the strength of our franchise.\"\n\nThe deposit-flush local banks typically do well when interest rates rise since they can reprice loans upwards as well as enjoy gapping opportunities which is putting their excess funds to work in the interbank market.\n\n\"The improvement in net interest margin (NIM) from 1.64 per cent a year ago to 1.70 per cent was mainly attributable to higher loan spreads as well as increased income from money market activities and gapping opportunities,\" said OCBC Bank.\n\nDBS' NIM of 1.66 per cent, up five points, was its best in six quarters due to repricing of loans and sale of higher fixed rate home loans. UOB's NIM improved three points to 1.73 per cent.\n\nLoan growth for all three banks remained in double-digit terms, bolstered by faster gains in the regional markets.\n\nOCBC posted 18 per cent year-on-year loan growth and 3 per cent on quarter. At UOB, it was 12.7 per cent on year and 3.6 per cent on quarter. DBS said loans grew 13 per cent from a year ago and 2 per cent on a quarterly basis.\n\nDelving deeper, OCBC and UOB, which have large franchises outside Singapore, saw the fastest loan gains in those markets.\n\nOCBC said growth was the highest in Greater China, up 74 per cent on year, and slowest at home, at 6 per cent. In fact, for the quarter it slipped one per cent.\n\nUOB's loan growth was more consistent: Singapore loans were up 11.9 per cent on year and 3.4 per cent on quarter while regional loans gained 15.3 per cent on year and 4.5 per cent on quarter. UOB counts its loans based on where they are booked.\n\nDBS said loans are classified according to where the borrower is incorporated, while OCBC said loans are based on where the credit risks reside.\n\nDBS said loans rose 13 per cent on year and 2 per cent on quarter. Growth was due to Singapore corporates, trade loans and home loans. Its Singapore loans slipped fractionally for the quarter. The banks also addressed their burgeoning China-related loans amid concerns over slower growth in the world's second largest economy.\n\nChina grew 7.4 per cent in the first quarter of this year, the slowest clip since Q2 2012.\n\nSpeaking at its results briefing, DBS chief financial officer Chng Sok Hui said the bank has \"done a deep dive and checked our China portfolio and we're comfortable with it\".\n\nDBS allowances for bad loans fell 32 per cent on year and were unchanged on quarter, in spite of a bigger loan book.\n\nElaborating, Mr Gupta said the trade loans are genuine and on average have been shortened to four months' duration. DBS has no exposure to China's shadow banking system, not via the banks it deals with, nor the companies it lends to, he said.\n\nOf its $48.7 billion loans to Greater China, about two-thirds are trade loans, $13 billion are loans to state-owned enterprises and another $1 billion to property developers, said Ms Chng.\n\nOCBC chief executive Samuel Tsien said the bank wants to attract top corporations in China that are venturing abroad, as that plays to its advantage as an offshore bank.\n\nIt would also mitigate risk in working with small and medium enterprise clients in China by attracting them via wealth management products, he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We have knowledgeable banks, analysts, research, law firms and, on top of it, we have a lot of companies in Singapore that deal with this (sector).\"\n\nThis support infrastructure is thus an ecosystem which spurs companies to set up, and eventually list here, he told reporters on the sidelines of the launch of trading in PACC Offshore Services Holdings (POSH) on the SGX yesterday.\n\nThe Business Times reported this month that the Maritime Port Authority of Singapore and the SGX were working together to attract more shipping and offshore companies to list here.\n\nNearly US$20 billion has been raised by the global shipping and offshore segments since January 2013, with the US and Norway accounting for as much as 90 per cent of the equity capital market activity in that time.\n\nMr Bocker acknowledged that Singapore still trailed behind those two countries in reeling in companies to list here, but pointed out that the Republic was not that far behind qualitatively speaking:\n\n\"There is no doubt that there are a certain number of companies going to the US, and there is a history in the way you can structure a listing in the US, sometimes with a bit more special features.\n\n\"Oslo is an interesting market but most of the IPOs there - if you look at the Oslo market - are smaller in amount terms.\"\n\nHe said the nearly S$400 million listing of POSH yesterday was an indication of the kind of IPO size that SGX is able to attract. \"If you look at IPOs in other parts of the world, they may be more in number of IPOs, but the money raised is not that large.\"\n\nThe listing of POSH yesterday took the number of maritime and offshore services companies listed here to 56; their total market capitalisation is nearly US$50 billion.\n\nIndustry professionals say, however, that if Singapore wants a bigger slice of the growing global shipping and offshore pie, still more needs to be done to attract companies in these sectors to list here.\n\nRahul Khemka, the director of strategic advisory at DNB Markets, told The Business Times that although the SGX is witnessing fewer maritime related issuances than the US and Norwegian markets, it is uniquely positioned to leverage the region's rising maritime activity and the growing liquidity among Asian investors.\n\nHe noted, however, that most of the demand in the recent shipping capital market has come from investors in the US and Europe, and that Asian investors have been less active in the current shipping cycle.\n\n\"The SGX has the potential to emerge as a preferred destination for maritime capital markets activity through continued dialogue with potential issuers, regulators and industry bodies. Increasing partnerships with maritime-focused investment banks will be an important channel to access leading industry players and active financial investors in the sector,\" he said.\n\nAsked to elaborate on the specific steps the SGX is taking to bring in more shipping-related companies, Mr Bocker declined comment.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/affection-imperfection", "site_title": "Affection for imperfection", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nAffection for imperfection\n\nItaly's youngest Michelin-starred chef Lorenzo Cogo tells Debbie Yong about getting a head start in life and his own brand of personality and imperfection-driven cooking\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 25, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWHEN John Legend croons about perfect imperfections in his latest radio hit, he may well be singing about Italian chef Lorenzo Cogo. While most chefs slave for days and weeks to pin down that elusive perfect balance between sweet, savoury, bitter, sour and umami flavours, the 27-year-old Italian chef is quite happy to tip the scales intentionally.\n\nThe chef-owner of one-Michelin-starred restaurant El Coq in Vicenza, 70km outside of Venice, elaborates: \"I love playing with flavours. Sometimes a dish may be too bitter or too sour - but it's all on purpose, done to prove a point and leave an impact.\"\n\nChef Cogo was in town earlier this month for a guest chef stint at the Tippling Club as part of the World Gourmet Summit. In the 17-course tasting menu he presented was a quenelle of cardamom ice-cream topped with a single string of carob tagliolini and finished off, table-side, with a pour of banana-infused grappa. The subtly sweet dessert had a surprising mouthcoating umami flavour that trailed off with a cloyingly bitter aftertaste.\n\n\"Bitterness is the soul of the Italian palate - and the tradition of our palate is what I want to showcase when I travel, rather than just recipes,\" he explains.\n\nThe message is driven home again in another course: a prim, maroon-and-white marriage of red martini-marinated beetroot with yoghurt sorbet and tapioca sago is set against a soil of dried beetroot, hazelnut, sea salt, and pops of Szechuan pepper. The tartness from a garnish of sorrel leaves and bitter diced cranberries complete the flamboyant flavour parade.\n\n\"To appreciate my food, you need to open your mind and say, 'All right, let's see what story this guy is trying to tell'. If you do, then you will enjoy it more. You may have a laugh, say this is crazy, but that's all part of the experience,\" he adds. \"I don't want to be perfect.\"\n\nLuckily for him, his imperfection was what some were seeking. It was that very beetroot dish - now christened the Beetroot Tribute and often showcased on his global guest chef stints - that caught the attention of influential Spanish food critic Rafael Garcia Santos, who called Chef Cogo a young prodigy and bequeathed El Coq the International lomejordelagastronomia.com Award in 2012. It sent a subsequent flurry of chefs and food writers booking in, recalls Chef Cogo. A Michelin star followed shortly, just one year into the restaurant's opening, flagging him further as one of the youngest Italian chefs to be recognised by the vaunted restaurant guide.\n\n\"If I go to a restaurant myself, I want to be surprised. I don't want to just eat good food, I want an experience, so I am focused on giving that at El Coq. There are so many great restaurants in this world using great produce with good techniques, and with good service staff in beautiful locations. But what makes restaurants really stand out is the identity of the chef behind it,\" he states.\n\nAssured as he seems in the kitchen and at the interview table, his own identity, he admits, is something that took a while to chisel out. Though born to a family who runs a traditional Italian trattoria, he felt from an early age that classic cuisine was not his calling.\n\n\"If you have a traditional recipe, you can't grow from there. There will always be someone telling you whether you are doing it wrong or right,\" he explains. The alternative route of reinventing classic dishes, however, was something he baulked at. \"I want to have my classic dishes as they are, untouched.\"\n\nSo that left him with the only option of paving his own route. He set off from his hometown of Thiene to work his way from the bottom up in more progressive restaurants in Milan and Vicenza, before the opportunity arose to work at the Vue du Monde in Melbourne, then Australia's top restaurant. (And also where he struck up a fast friendship with the Tippling Club's Ryan Clift.)\n\nPostings to other leading Australian restaurants such as Mark, Tetsuya's and Quay followed for the fast learner, then a tutelage in Japan under Seiji Yamamoto, before he headed back to Europe for stints at The Fat Duck, Noma and Basque restaurant, Extebarri.\n\n\"I've always travelled with the aim of opening my own restaurant, and I constantly had many ideas running through my mind. I just knew I wanted to do something,\" he says.\n\nHe moved home to open his restaurant in 2011 but influences from his star-studded resume are still apparent in his creations today. A dish titled Bottom of the Sea brings together Nordic-meets-Nippon flavours such as seaweed fronds, herring and salmon caviar and lettuce and seaweed granite, rounded out with beautifully smoky flakes of salmon that bear imprints of Extebarri's barbecue-centric cooking.\n\nThe mash-up is all part of what Chef Cogo once labelled \"instinctive cuisine\", or cooking that isn't inscribed by any particular style, technique or regional flavour.\n\n\"We are not doing molecular cuisine or traditional Italian cuisine - we are just doing what we feel is right,\" he says. And, as loose a philosophy as that is, it is a vision he hopes to take global. \"The idea of Italian food everywhere is very classic, but we have more than just pizza and pasta in Italy. My cooking is Italian too, even though people may not quite get it the first time.\"\n\nThe restlessness is driven, not least, by the significant dent on the Italian restaurant industry caused by the Europe-wide economic slowdown. Though he initially chose to open El Coq in its current location for its proximity to fresh produce and wild foragable forests, it has been a struggle to keep the 25-seater constantly full, he admits. \"Even three-Michelin star restaurants in Italy are empty,\" he shrugs helplessly.\n\nOpening a second restaurant in Asia is a pipe dream for now, but he's been filling up his travel calendar to gain momentum in the meantime. Shortly after his Singapore visit, he was off to Paris to guest chef alongside contemporary culinary rising star, David Toutain, \"because I need to keep growing and finding new stimulation\".\n\nWhere does he get all the energy from, you ask. Youth?\n\n\"Youth was and is an advantage,\" he states unequivocally. \"I had the advantage of starting very young. I was born in a kitchen so it all came naturally to me, and it is still an advantage because I want to do all of this while I'm young and have plenty of energy and passion.\"\n\nThen, with a grave practicality you wouldn't expect from his charming, boyish demeanour, Chef Cogo adds: \"I come from a family who works a lot, which is why I want to start early to build a business that works well. So that by the time I start a family, I can enjoy the time my father never gave me.\"\n\n(El Coq, it is said, is his father's childhood nickname, though the elder Mr Cogo has only dined in the restaurant once \"and he still doesn't really get my food\", the younger Chef Cogo shares in a candid moment.)\n\n\"I don't want to spend all my life in the restaurant. To have my restaurant, to do interesting food with a good team behind me, that's more than enough,\" he says.\n\n\"The main goal is to be happy.\"\n\nBy Debbie Yong\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\n@DebbieYongBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In yesterday's session, it slid 16.36 per cent or 0.5 per cent in tandem with a 1.5 per cent loss on Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index and a soft opening Europe-wide - probably in anticipation of a weak Friday for Wall Street.\n\nOne of the week's biggest talking points was provided by trading in the shares of rail operator SMRT. On Thursday, the stock surged almost 19 per cent to a four-month high of $1.215 in volume, drawing a query and later a TWC from SGX after the company said it did not know of reasons for the interest in its shares.\n\nBrokers speculated that the company was close to striking a deal with regulators on a new financing model that could turn its loss-making units around.\n\nBut Maybank Kim Eng warned against believing the speculation and recommended a \"sell\", with a 60-cent target yesterday. Its broker said: \"While a change is imminent, it is highly speculative to conclude that the terms will be favourable to shareholders.\n\n\"In particular, we are concerned over the treatment of the asset purchase obligations under the old rail-financing regime... In the absence of material announcements, we advise investors to stay cautious. SMRT trades at a rich valuation of 30x FY3/15E P/E. Maintain SELL.\"\n\nDespite the TWC notice, SMRT's shares held steady yesterday, first falling to an intra-day low of $1.16, before bouncing up to $1.26 for a nett gain of 4.5 cents on the day, with 25 million traded. For the week, the stock rose 24 cents or 23.5 per cent.\n\nIn the commodities sector, Temasek Holding's takeover offer for Olam International has now become unconditional, after Temasek's shareholding of Olam crossed 50 per cent. United Industrial Corp said its stake in\n\nSingLand is now just above the 90 per cent threshold it needs to delist SingLand.\n\nElsewhere, SGX's shares dropped a cent over the week to finish at $6.95; the exchange mid-week reported that its Q3 profit dropped 22.4 per cent to $75.8 million. Most brokers responded with cuts in their profit forecasts and cautious \"hold\" recommendations.\n\nAs for Wall Street's movements, Michael Kahn, the technical analyst at US newspaper Barron's, on Thursday wrote that the NYSE's advance-decline score recently hit a new high, which suggests there was broad participation in the past week's rally.\n\n\"For one day last week, however, the number of new 52-week lows was greater than the number of 52-week highs,\" he said.\n\n\"Considering that the S&P 500 was still just seven days removed from an all-time high, that was unusual, to say the least.

Operating profit increased 6 per cent to $17.2 million.\n\nIts healthcare services and hospital services divisions chalked up revenue growth of 14.3 per cent and 4.8 per cent, respectively.\n\nIts hospital services grew at a slower clip than usual due to \"seasonal variations\" and \"external factors\", said executive chairman Loo Choon Yong at a media briefing yesterday.\n\nFor instance, the depreciation of the rupiah against the Singapore dollar and the elections in Indonesia have contributed to a 10-15 per cent year-on-year decline in medical tourists from Indonesia during the quarter. Indonesia is RMG's biggest source market for medical tourism.\n\n\"We think it will rebound,\" Dr Loo added.\n\nIn an update on its property at Holland Village, which it announced it was acquiring last year, RMG said construction work had started on the five-storey commercial building early this month. With a floor area of around 62,720 square feet, 9,000 sq ft will go to medical and specialist services, which are expected to cater to areas such as obstetrics & gynaecology, paediatrics, dermatology and dentistry, when the building is ready at the end of 2015 or early 2016. Meanwhile, DBS Bank will take up some 4,500 sq ft and the remainder will be available for retail shops and food-and-beverage outlets.\n\nOutside of Singapore, RMG is launching a representative office in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, in early May to encourage more patients to come to Singapore. Previously, it had relied on its associates in Vietnam to do this.\n\nCash and cash equivalents fell to $98.3 million as at end-March from $265.9 million as at end-December, due to the acquisition of two properties, namely the one at Holland Village and the site adjacent to Raffles Hospital to facilitate its expansion.\n\n\"The more measured pace of economic growth in China and Singapore may have a dampening effect on healthcare demand in general. However, the group is well positioned for the future given its recent investments in two new assets,\" it said.\n\nThe counter closed unchanged at $3.42 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But its rental index, showing rentals at retail malls in the Central Region dipping slightly in the first quarter, drew disbelief from retailers. Retailers and food & beverage (F&B) operators told BT that the marginal 0.3 per cent decline in the rental index from a quarter ago is puzzling, given that they have seen a steady rise in rents in their rental renewals with the landlords.\n\nURA's rental index is flat from a year ago and rose 1.1 per cent over the past three years. The Central Region covers the core downtown area and city fringe areas such as Paya Lebar and Holland.\n\nFor the first time, URA's data includes non-shop space such as food and beverage, entertainment and health and fitness - which is applauded by analysts for factoring in a shift in leasing activity towards these sectors. But retailers felt that these figures still do not reflect what is truly happening on the ground.\n\n\"For every three years that our rents are being reviewed, rentals are going up steadily,\" said John Yek, managing director of RE&S Enterprises, which owns several Japanese restaurants islandwide. \"For sure, they are not flat if I compare to three years ago.\"\n\nElim Chew, founder of fashion retailer 77th Street, said that rentals have soared over the past three years, prompting the company to close some outlets. The median rents may not take into account the component that tenants pay as a percentage of their sales.\n\nMeanwhile, URA's retail price index for the Central Region showed a 3.2 per cent rise in the first quarter from a year ago and is unchanged from a quarter ago.\n\nThe discrepancy between the indices and ground sentiments could be due to the fact that the data looks at rentals and prices in the Central Region and excludes suburban malls in areas such as Jurong East, Tampines and Bedok, property consultants say.\n\nMore detailed information, however, is made available on commercial properties for free on URA's website. Office and retail rents can be searched by street name and includes far-flung areas where new malls have sprung up.\n\nAlice Tan, associate director for consultancy and research at Knight Frank, noted that the indices may not be showing the full picture since suburban retail rents are excluded from the computation of the indices Ms Tan expects a 3-5 per cent decline in shop space rents this year from 2013 given the consolidation of business by retailers and stronger competition from upcoming retail malls in the suburban areas, including The Seletar Mall and Big Box that may open in the second half of this year.\n\n\"Moderation in rentals for overall retail space could be less pronounced at 1-2 per cent this year compared to shop space because of stable demand for F&B and entertainment spaces,\" Ms Tan said.\n\nWith some malls in the downtown area undergoing asset enhancement works, leasing activity may cool in the second quarter before picking up, she added.\n\nDesmond Sim, head of CBRE Research Singapore, noted that there is still strong tenant demand, with tight occupancy rates seen in shopping malls operated by real estate investment trusts or Reits.\n\nThough the vacancy rate for retail space has risen to 5.8 per cent in the first quarter, from 4.5 per cent in the preceding quarter, it is partially due to some projects being awarded TOP (temporary occupation permit) towards the end of this quarter, Mr Sim said. The stock of retail space increased by a net 19,000 sq m in the first quarter.\n\nSome large-format tenants also closed their stores in the first quarter but these vacated spaces have secured new tenants or are currently undergoing asset enhancement, he added.\n\nOn the whole, landlords have not raised rents significantly beyond inflation rate, Mr Sim observed.\n\nRetailers hold a different view, however. R Dhinakaran, managing director of Jay Gee Melwani Group, a retailer of international names in lifestyle and apparel, said that shop rentals have increased for the group islandwide. Rentals account for more than half of the group's overheads and its margins are squeezed, he said.\n\nTo cope with rising rentals, Ms Chew of 77th Street said that the company has moved into wholesale distribution, e-commerce and consultancy work for overseas brands. According to her, local retailers may be paying much higher rents on a per square foot basis in some malls than the international brands, which are more sought after by the landlords.\n\nKurt Wee, president of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises, noted that retailers and F&B players \"have no bargaining power\" and regulation is required to protect them from unreasonable tenant clauses.\n\nURA data shows that there are 928,000 sq m of new gross retail space in the first quarter, of which 634,000 sq m is under construction. Some 256,000 sq m of gross retail space is expected to be completed by the end of this year.\n\n.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Yesterday, DBS Group Research's Sachin Mittal had to downgrade StarHub back to \"hold\" from \"buy\" after regulatory intervention made the telco backpedal on its plan to charge for 4G services.\n\nAs a result of the about-turn, existing StarHub SmartSurf customers whose contracts have not expired will not be charged more for the 4G service in June.\n\nNow, Mr Mittal's estimated proportion of postpaid StarHub subscribers paying more for the service this year has dropped from 75 per cent to 25 per cent.\n\nThe analyst also downgraded StarHub's target price of $4.50 back to $4.30 - the price from which he had upgraded the telco's stock on Monday in anticipation of the 4G earnings boost.\n\nStarHub's counter shrugged off the news yesterday, gaining one cent to $4.16.\n\nLast week, StarHub became the first telco to announce an end to the free 4G service promotion that all three telcos offer. From June, most StarHub mobile users on the 4G service would have had to pay $2.14 a month.\n\nOn Wednesday, however, the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore expressed its disapproval, saying that telcos \"should not change prices mid-way that affect customers with minimum term contracts, if they were not clear to customers upfront what those price changes might be\".\n\nStarHub asserted in return that it had been \"upfront with customers\" about the free 4G service promotion.\n\nThis development might have larger industry implications, according to DBS's Mr Mittal.\n\n\"Regulatory activism also means the telcos' plan to charge premium price for priority data service using LTE-Advanced network in H2 2014F may be subject to regulatory scrutiny, too,\" he said yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will, however, lease the land being sold for the next two years to move the farming assets and livestock there to its farms in the eastern and central regions.\n\nIn a separate transaction, it sold 6,002 hectares of dairy farmland in eastern Uruguay to agribusiness firm Galperin Group.\n\nOlam has entered into a long-term lease agreement for 12 years with the firm, which is renewable if both mutually agree.\n\nOlam said that it will book a one-time pre-tax gain of about US$18 million when these transactions are completed in the fourth quarter of the current financial year.\n\nVivek Verma, managing director and global head of dairy, said that the transactions were aligned with Olam's strategy to pursue profitable growth and generate positive free cash flow.\n\n\"Not only do we free up cash for redeployment into other more value-accretive projects, we also retain the upstream dairy farming economics, which remain fundamentally and structurally attractive in the long term due to increasing demand and supply constraints,\" he said.\n\nOlam had previously conducted two sale and leaseback transactions of its almond orchards in Australia and the US, for A$45 million (S$52.4 million) and S$18.1 million in post-tax capital gains respectively.\n\nThe 10 transactions that Olam has undertaken to optimise its balance sheet as at February are expected to generate $446 million in cash and $76 million in profit gain by the end of the current financial year.\n\nOlam aims to achieve positive free cash flow by the end of its financial year in June.\n\nMeanwhile, Temasek Holdings' offer to buy all the Olam shares it does not already own at $2.23 a share turned unconditional on Thursday, as the total shareholding by its unit Breedens Investments and its concert parties crossed the 50 per cent mark of Olam's maximum potential share capital.\n\nThe consortium has acquired 50.4 per cent of the maximum potential share capital, or 57.4 per cent of all issued shares, of Olam as at 5 pm on Thursday.

Despite the index's large rise, the broad market excluding warrants recorded 204 rises versus 206 falls, suggesting interest was narrowly focused on only a handful of blue chips.\n\nGains in the three banks contributed 16 points towards the STI's rise, a powerful reminder of how susceptible the index is to movements in its larger components. The Jardine group, which usually plays a big part in the index's rises and falls, accounted for a further 5 points.\n\nAll three banks finished off their highs for the day. OCBC first rose to $9.77 but ended at $9.65 for a net gain of 18 cents that came with 13.4 million shares traded, UOB touched $21.89 but pulled back to $21.76 for a net gain of 58 cents with six million shares traded, and DBS raced off to $17.31 but pulled back to $16.94, only 10 cents higher on the day on volume of nine million.\n\nBusiness done in the three banks amounted to $414 million or 26 per cent of the entire market's turnover.\n\nBrokers said OCBC's and DBS' results prompted some of the buying but added that there was likely some element of month-ending window-dressing at play as well. \"With this kind of volume, you know there is something up and in this case, it must be window-dressing,\" said a dealer. For April, the index gained 76 points or 2.4 per cent.\n\nOCBC reported a 29 per cent rise in Q1 profit to $899 million while DBS reported a 30 per cent rise in its Q1 earnings to $1.23 billion.\n\nAmong shipyards, Vard Holdings' shares ended one cent higher at 96.5 cents with 7.6 million traded. The company has reported a 51 per cent drop in Q1 profit to 92 million Norwegian kroner but its results have prompted analysts to surmise that the worst may be over for the company.\n\nMacquarie Equities Research, for example, said it expects 54 per cent profit growth in 2014 and that at 7x 2015 P/E and 1.2x P/B, Vard is a value buy.\n\n\"The gradual decline of Brazil losses and better utilisation of the other yards indicate that revenues and margins are set to improve quarter after quarter for VARD. The strong turnaround story in 2014 and 2015 is very much on track and the stock is a value buy at current valuations,\" said MER. It set a 12-month target of $1.25 using a discounted cash flow model.\n\nIn the China water treatment sector, SIIC Environment's shares ended 0.3 cent weaker at 16.7 cents with 42.6 million done. OSK DMG yesterday called a \"buy\" with a 19-cent target.\n\n\"We upgrade SIIC to BUY on a few key reasons, namely: i) SIIC's share price has pulled back 10 per cent since our initiation, ii) raised EPS estimates to CNY3.04 cents on stronger than expected contributions from newly acquired assets, and iii) earnings accretive acquisition efforts have borne fruit and now provide investors with greater earnings visibility on the company,\" said the broker. Its target price is based on 30x FY2014 earnings.\n\nFund managers Schroders in its April 29 Economics and Strategy viewpoint said that for all the talk of the US losing its pre-eminence and influence, its economy is leading the recovery in the developed world and its equity market continues to outperform the global index.\n\n\"Growth in the world's largest economy now seems to be picking up again after a harsh winter and activity looks set to accelerate as we head into the summer,\" said Schroders, adding that the US is likely to be less of a locomotive for global growth than it has been in previous cycles.\n\n\"Consumer spending is likely to be more lacklustre and, of the demand generated by the US, more is likely to be met by domestic rather than overseas production.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was a slightly bigger drop than the 0.5 per cent dip in Q4 last year.\n\n\"What we have seen so far are relatively modest drops, until we feel the full effects of the new supply completions,\" said JLL national director Ong Teck Hui.\n\nThe vacancy rate for completed private homes (excluding executive condominiums or ECs) increased to 6.6 per cent at end-Q1 2014, from 6.2 per cent at end-Q4 last year.\n\nBased on estimates provided by developers to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), private housing completions are projected to hit 17,138 units this year, including the 4,114 units completed in Q1. This will be higher than the 13,150 units completed last year and 10,329 units in 2012. The pace of completions is projected to accelerate further - to 21,738 units in 2015 and 26,252 units in 2016.\n\n\"Due to the step-up in Government Land Sales in the past few years in response to the heated residential segment, the number of units under construction has snowballed to 67,507 in Q1, double that of four years ago.\n\n\"The growth in new completions will not be matched by demand from tenants as hiring of foreign executives has been curbed with hardly any growth in employment pass figures,\" said Mr Ong. He estimates a 4-7 per cent decline in private residential rents this year.\n\nLee Lay Keng, regional head (SEA) research at DTZ, predicts an up to 5 per cent rental decline this year, with a bigger fall next year.\n\n\"The rental drop may be higher in the suburbs, where the bulk of supply completions will be. Moreover, rental units there will also face competition from rental HDB flats. However, high-end properties will not be spared either as higher property tax rates affect this segment more,\" she said. \"From Jan 1, 2014, landlords can no longer claim vacancy refunds on property tax. So if you do not want to pay property taxes on an empty unit, and with heightened competition for tenants, you may be more flexible on rental levels if you're an investor.\"\n\nAlan Cheong, research head at Savills Singapore, expects rents to ease 2-5 per cent in 2014, but reasons that investors who have bought private homes in the past two years have been subject to lower loan-to-value limits. Hence their mortgage payments may still be manageable despite softening rents. \"So these buyers have stronger holding power, reducing the risk that they will be forced to sell their properties.\"\n\nAnother reason he does not expect a major price correction is the \"elevated cost of production for developers\" - in terms of construction costs and the high land prices they have paid. \"In a normal functioning market, that is, short of a crisis, it is unrealistic to expect prices to 'collapse' or decline significantly.\"\n\nMr Cheong expects URA's overall private residential property price index to remain flat on a full-year basis. Despite the 1.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter drop in the first quarter, the index may rebound in subsequent quarters, depending on the type of projects that are launched, he added.\n\nMost other property consultants predict a 5-10 per cent full-year price decline. Colliers International director Chia Siew Chuin said high-end homes will take a bigger price hit, to the tune of 10-15 per cent, given the odds stacked up against them - including weaker foreign buying, an anaemic leasing market and supply-side pressure from developers feeling the heat to meet regulatory deadlines to complete developing their projects and selling all the units.\n\nThe latest 1.3 per cent Q1 drop in URA's private home price index was steeper than the 0.9 per cent decline in the previous quarter.\n\nGiving a breakdown of non-landed private home prices by region, URA said the sub-index for Core Central Region (CCR) slipped 1.1 per cent in Q1 - half the 2.1 per cent drop in the previous quarter.\n\nPrices in Rest of Central Region (RCR) - which includes places such as Bukit Merah, Bishan and Geylang - eased 3.3 per cent in Q1, against a 0.4 per cent gain previously. In Outside Central Region (OCR) - home of mass-market condos - prices dipped 0.1 per cent in Q1 following a one per cent decline.\n\nFor both RCR and CCR, first-quarter prices of uncompleted units fell at a faster clip compared with completed properties. However, uncompleted homes in OCR rose 1.4 per cent, while completed unit prices fell 3.5 per cent.\n\nURA's office price index rose 0.5 per cent in Q1, matching the increase in the previous quarter. Its office rental index appreciated at a stronger pace of 2.4 per cent, compared with the 0.5 per cent rise previously. Net new demand for office space decreased to 64,583 sq ft in Q1 from 322,917 sq ft in Q4, which sent the vacancy rate inching up to 10 per cent from 9.9 per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Cheah Ui-Hoon\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 25, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nONE of the most personalised and individualised approaches to cancer treatment is now available in Singapore - with the introduction of Champions Tumorgraft. While strides have been made through testing the molecular genetics in the patient's cancer and selecting the appropriate targeted agents, a faster and easier way for true personalisation is now available, says David Sidransky, an oncologist and chairman of Champions Oncology, which offers Champions Tumorgraft.\n\n\"Personalised therapy is important now in all medicine and especially in oncology,\" he says. \"However, oncology medication deals with general situations and is not specific to the patient. The medication is effective in some 20-50 per cent of cases. About half of the patients won't receive benefits, and they lose time as well as accumulate toxicity through chemotherapy.\"\n\nChampions Tumorgraft works on a different principle and it's primarily a diagnostic tool. Instead of \"testing\" drugs on the patient, the principle is to test drugs against the patient's own tumour - grafted onto a colony of mice, so that they represent the tumour in the patient. The understanding is that if the drug has the same effect on the tumour in the mouse, it will have an effect on the patients.\n\n\"This, we found, is the easiest and fastest way - to test drugs on an 'avatar' - and with 90 per cent accuracy,\" explains Dr Sidransky who was profiled by Time magazine in 2001 as one of the top physicians/scientists in America, in recognition of his work with early detection of cancer.\n\nMice are used because they're the biggest of small animals, are easy to breed and this particular breed has very little immune system so they are good \"vessels\" for the tumours implanted into them.\n\n\"The patient's tumour is put into some 20 to 30 mice, like growing a tumour bank. Once the tumours have successfully grown in the colony of mice, then testing begins, and this is a process which takes four weeks. It is important to note that a whole colony is needed to support the process,\" says Dr Sidransky.\n\nCreating this living colony is a personalised and continuous system. A colony takes three months to grow, and testing takes another four weeks. \"But once you go through the trouble of growing the colony, the accuracy is 90 per cent for selecting drugs through this process,\" he points out.\n\nStatistics show that about 50 per cent of cancer patients will have their cancer recur, and go into second line therapy. Only about 15 per cent will benefit from the second round of therapy in current conventional treatments. With this new method that provides a high chance of finding the best drug for the patient, the chances of the personalised drug working get raised to 90 per cent as well.\n\n\"The typical benefit is that the tumour will shrink in six to nine months. Finding the best therapy is the main aim, and toxicity is also minimised.\"\n\nDr Sidransky says that all 12 solid cancer tumours have been successfully tried in this method, as they form 95 per cent of cancers that people get.\n\nFor now, Champions Tumorgraft is recommended for selection of second-line therapy as the main disadvantage is the time lag required for the whole process, beginning from the growing of the colony (which takes up to three months) to the testing of drugs on this colony of mice (one month minimum). Molecular testing is the first stage, to gain knowledge of what type of drugs might best benefit a patient. But the empirical testing of various drugs on mice is much more accurate and the information can be used to guide the testing.\n\n\"We either find something that works immediately, or the information guides further testing,\" says Dr Sidransky. He says that tumour-grafting for testing was a technology that was first published in 2002, but last year, there were 3,000 publications on the technology. \"It's completely penetrated the academic setting with every major pharmaceutical company doing it. But we're the only ones doing it for patients, while still being able to establish models and develop drugs.\"\n\n\"Time is a very important factor,\" notes Ang Peng Tiam, medical director of Parkway Cancer Centre, which is a partner of Champions Tumorgraft, \"when it comes to selecting the right patients for this diagnostic tool because the entire process, from the implantation of the tumour in the mice to obtaining the results of the drug testing, takes about three to four months.\"\n\nWith sufficient time, this technology can be suitable for a wide range of patients, such as those with advanced stage diseases - stages 3 and 4 and patients who have an aggressive disease with a high risk of cancer recurrence.\n\n\"Patients who are diagnosed with cancer at an early stage and/or have high risk of cancer recurrence are the best candidates to undergo the treatment programme,\" points out Dr Ang.\n\nThe cost starts at S$5,000, and prices vary depending on the number of cancer anti-agents tested on the mice, he says. \"For example, a typical patient may need to test three drug combinations. The cost for this patient will definitely differ from the cost of another patient who may want or need to test 10 different drug combinations,\" he points out, adding that the cost is secondary as compared to the benefits such as time saved and greater efficiency of treatment.\n\nDr Sidransky notes that the world is already doing \"some form\" of molecular personalisation for cancer patients, but in the next five years, graft-testing or a derivative will become a major part of the solution for cancer.\n\nIn Singapore, Dr Ang notes that the three biggest advancements of cancer treatments here are in the understanding of the molecular genetics of cancer, the capability of Singapore labs to make this commercially available for our patients, and the discovery and availability of many new targeted agents that are effective in treating carefully selected subgroups of cancer patients with specific mutations in their cancer.\n\nuihoon@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Stick around in Barcelona for some good eats instead. Jaime Ee checks out two eateries\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 25, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nAbac\n\nAvinguda del Tibidabo, 1, 08022 Barcelona, Spain\n\nTel +34 933 19 66 00.\n\nwww.abacbarcelona.com\n\nOF all the Michelin-starred Spanish chefs who've come our way in the past few years, Jordi Cruz has surprisingly not been among them. But the chef of the two Michelin-starred restaurant Abac is too good to ignore on your next visit to the Catalonian capital.\n\nWhile the food at El Celler de Can Roca is poised and seriously sophisticated, the 36-year-old Cruz's cooking is confident without being over-intellectual. He knows his stuff, whether it's molecular wizardry with liquid nitrogen and spherification or traditional slow-cooking and braising, but he does it all with a a happy combination of concentration and insouciance that makes a meal at Abac deliciously fun.\n\nLocated in an upscale neighbourhood on the edge of Barcelona's city centre, Abac sits in a five-star boutique hotel of the same name at the foot of Mount Tibidabo - which you can see in the distance. It's a sleek, trendy and private abode where guests come and go as if they're living in their own home. The restaurant is your garden variety fine-dining outpost, but with a welcoming vibe.\n\nFriendly servers are quick and efficient, and kick off your meal with a theatrical frozen passion fruit sorbet made at your table with liquid nitrogen. Bitter, salty and sour, it's paired with a stick of raw sugar cane that you chew before digging into the frozen slush served in the shell of the passion fruit.\n\nCruz is surprisingly adept with Asian flavours, fusing his courses with familiar but not jarring accents of curry, soya sauce and Japanese seaweed, and even doing an impressive version of deep-fried mantou that he stuffs with melt-in-the-mouth grilled eel, paired with Japanese mustard and aioli.\n\nSweet sea urchin is bathed in a mild curry-accented sauce with a light kaffir lime scent, while tender spare rib is given a light Thai rub. Despite the exotica, the fusion doesn't come across as out of place - if anything, it's heightened by tempering it with typical Spanish flourishes.\n\nOther highlights include an ingenious \"risotto\" of tender, slow-cooked pine nuts instead of rice, mixed with unctuous egg yolk, parmesan cream and shredded bacon floss for some amazing comforting flavour and mouth feel. Parmesan \"gnocchi\" or rather spherifications of cheese cream are also impressive, served with crunchy white asparagus in a clear mushroom broth. Spherification may be old hat but Cruz brings back the fun with a dessert of gin and tonic \"bubbles\" with mango sorbet.\n\nIf you think progressive cooking needs to be enjoyed with a steady amount of reverence, this is one case where you can have fun and eat it too.\n\nEspai Kru\n\nCarrer de Lleida, 7 (Barcelona)\n\nUpper floor of R\u00edas de Galicia\n\nTel 933 300 303\n\nIF the stylised Japanese-Peruvian posturing of Albert Adria's Pakta goes over your head, go next door for a taste of simple, unadulterated Mediterranean seafood at Espai Kru. It literally is next door to Pakta, and sits above its more conservative parent Rias de Galicia - the seafood eatery often reported as Ferran Adria's favourite restaurant in Barcelona.\n\nIt also happens that Adria is a quiet consultant to Rias de Galicia, which specialises in traditional Spanish seafood cooking, as well as its funkier offspring Espai Kru upstairs, which is one of the nicest raw bars in town.\n\nTaking pride of place is a large chiller display of the day's catch, whether it's sashimi grade tuna or freshly caught seafood from the waters off Galicia in northwestern Spain. Just ask for whatever's freshest, with as little embellishment as possible. Enjoy the briny tang of fresh oysters dressed in ponzu or gazpacho, crunchy razor clams with just a light slick of sauce, or raw scallops paired with sea urchin marred unfortunately by teriyaki sauce.\n\nIt even offers a sashimi platter of meaty, sweet and nicely sticky-textured raw squid, quirkily named llampuga (resembling mahi-mahi), dorade (a kind of sea bream) and tuna belly, or a ceviche of red mullet, sliced and artfully re-assembled to look like the whole fish.\n\nThe restaurant tends to douse its super-fresh fish unnecessarily with tart lemon juice or other sauces, so it might not be a bad idea to tell them to hold the condiments where possible. If raw isn't your thing, Espai Kru does a very good deep-fried turbot that you can eat, bones and all. For dessert, check out the Torrija or Spanish french toast soaked in milk, topped with creme catalan and torched to achieve a crisp sugar shell.\n\nIf trendy bores you, Espai Kru's blend of simple seafood in vibrant surroundings is the perfect antidote.\n\njaime@sph.com.sg\n\n@JaimeEeBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They may be entering an exclusive due diligence period on the asset, BT understands.\n\nThe price is thought to be around $550-560 million, which would work out to $2,177-$2,217 per square foot based on the building's net lettable area of about 252,600 sq ft.\n\nIt is thought that Equity Plaza's owners - Keppel Land and a fund managed by Alpha Investment Partners - were looking for $580 million or $2,300 psf for the asset. Alpha is KepLand's wholly owned property fund management arm.\n\nEquity Plaza - which was formerly known as The Exchange and The Quadrant - is on a site with a balance lease term of about 74 years. Offices fill levels three to 28 of the building, while the first level has a retail unit. There are close to 90 carpark lots in the basement levels.\n\nMarket watchers reckon that GSH and Mr Goi could be looking for a source of steady rental income from the asset, which stands at a busy corner bound by Cecil, Church and Market streets. Or GSH could potentially occupy part of the building in future.\n\nHowever, the potential buyers may be eyeing the possibility of sub-dividing the building into smaller units and selling them.\n\nBT understands that the authorities granted preliminary approval for strata sub-division in the building last November.\n\nCompleted 22 years ago, the building may have about 15,000 sq ft of unutilised gross floor area (GFA) - roughly 5 per cent of the existing GFA. The additional space could be utilised for food & beverage use, say market watchers.\n\nGSH - which stands for Global Strategic Holdings - was a struggling consumer goods distributor that took on new life as a property developer after Mr Goi boosted his stake in the company and took a more active role a couple of years ago. The company, formerly known as JEL Corp, has its headquarters at GSH Centre along Changi North Way.\n\nOpposite Equity Plaza, a potential deal is said to be in the works at Prudential Tower, for a 92.8 per cent stake in the building that is owned by Keppel Reit.\n\nKepLand is the Reit's sponsor. A consortium, whose members are said to include private equity group KOP and listed group Lian Beng, is believed to be doing exclusive due diligence on a potential purchase of Keppel Reit's space in Prudential Tower.\n\nBased on BT's report last week, the price could be around $2,340 psf or close to $520 million.\n\nPrudential Tower is on a balance lease term of about 81 years. It is already a strata-titled property - with one strata title per floor on the higher levels and two units per floor on the lower levels.\n\nThis would facilitate strata sales in the building by any new owners.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Mitsui also paid 2.4 million yuan in legal fees, the court said.\n\nJapanese media had earlier reported that Mitsui paid about four billion yen to free the Baosteel Emotion, a 226,434 deadweight-tonne ore carrier.\n\nThe ship was seized on Saturday over Mitsui's alleged failure to pay compensation for lease agreements on two Chinese ships that were broken in 1937, when war broke out between Japan and China.\n\nMitsui said in a statement the court had released the vessel yesterday and it was preparing to depart Chinese waters. It did not say how much it had paid to resolve the case.\n\nThe amount the court said Mitsui paid is almost half the estimated US$65 million value of the two-year old carrier, according to a ship broker.\n\nThe Supreme Court statement did not name the plaintiffs in the case or say what would happen to funds paid by Mitsui.\n\nIn 1936, Chung Wei Steamship Co, a Chinese shipping firm, leased two freighters to a Japanese company that was a predecessor of Mitsui.\n\nBoth Mitsui and China's official Xinhua news agency say the ships were expropriated by the Japanese government before the leases had expired. One of the ships hit a reef and sank in 1938 while another was destroyed by a mine in 1944, Xinhua said.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Chen Zhen and Chen Chun brought a lawsuit against the company which later became Mitsui. The two descendents of Chen Shuntong, who owned Chung Wei Steamship Co, were among other plaintiffs seeking financial compensation in a Shanghai court for the loss of the two vessels.\n\nA number of court cases demanding compensation from Japan for forced wartime labour have arisen in China and South Korea. In February, two Japanese firms were sued in what media said was the first time a Chinese court had accepted such a case. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

It distributes the Continental, Falken and Toyo brands, as well as its proprietary brand, Sumo Firenza. Its distribution network spans more than 10 countries, predominantly in South-east Asia, and it exports to more than 90 countries.\n\nThe erection of the centre started two years ago on land owned by the company. Previously, Stamford's warehousing needs had been outsourced at the site for $200,000 a month.\n\nStamford Tyres president Wee Kok Wah said the previous warehouse offered limited storage capacities; the redeveloped one, however, optimises land use for its tyre and wheel distribution, truck centre and retread plant operations.\n\nThe centre cost $20.5 million to build; its equipment and a racking system cost another $4.5 million.\n\nThe building cost was funded by cash accumulated from divesting a China business, as well as a 12-year loan.\n\nTo provide comprehensive tyre services, the centre has six service bays for trucks and eight loading/unloading container bays. Stamford's \"total tyre management\" programme includes long-term tyre leasing contracts to large end-users such as PSA, SMRT, SBS Transit and Colex.\n\nMr Wee said the centre has 50 per cent spare capacity, which can be rented out for $150,000 per month.\n\nHe added that the company's biggest challenge lay in getting staff.\n\n\"Safety is also a big issue and customers demand 24/7 service, but we tend to lock in our customers for a long time,\" he added, explaining that this was because Stamford has shown them that it has been able to reduce their costs.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Young chef Aaron Leow, who previously did stints at Noma and hot new Michelin-starred restaurant Studio in Copenhagen, will send out four New Nordic Kitchen-inspired courses, all tweaked to flow with the storyline.\n\nMs Png, 24, a fashion merchandiser and her fiance, studio engineer Stuart Wee, 27, say they started events company And So Forth after attending similar events organised by Secret Cinema and nomadic restaurant Gingerline, while holidaying in London last year.\n\nThough Singapore lacks the grungy underground spaces, history-seeped buildings and thriving theatre-going culture of London, the couple are plugging on with the hope that And So Forth can serve as a platform to showcase budding local talents.\n\nThe dinner's plot was penned by Mingyu Lin, a London-based Singaporean professional scriptwriter who co-founded a film production company there, while local actors Daphne Quah, Edward Choy and Windson Liong will headline as the dinner show's main characters. Acting students from LaSalle College of the Arts will double as waitstaff to maximise the interactive experience and the rest of the team of set designers, menu illustrators and costume makers similarly comprise young talents in their 20s. Dinners cost $125 per person, \"about the price you'd pay to watch a show, except you'll be in the show too\", says Ms Png. Depending on the response for their first run, the duo hope to organise future dinner-theatre events around other stories.\n\n\"With more pop-up shops and food trucks starting up in the last few months, it's an indication that people want something more interesting to do on the weekends,\" she adds.\n\nBy Debbie Yong\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\n@DebbieYongBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But while this supply is broadly welcome, more can be done to re-align this with what business needs, consultants said.\n\nAccording to JTC Corp's figures, an average of 2.1 million square metres (sq m) of industrial space is expected to hit the market annually over the next three years. Of this, about 28 per cent is multiple-user factory space. The remaining space is mainly single-user factory space (37 per cent) and warehouse space (25 per cent). Some business park space will also be built over the next three years.\n\nBut consultants warn that this could result in a supply glut, and instead call for a more targeted approach.\n\n\"In effect, there is no real shortage,\" said Chia Siew Chuin, research director at Colliers Singapore. \"Any shortage could just be perceived, as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have provided feedback to the government that there is a 'shortage' of suitable/affordable industrial space for them.\"\n\nBut increasing the supply - especially if the additional space is not useful for modern industrialists, many of which are SMEs - is not the answer. Instead, the government should realign how industrial space is used to include more companies that are involved in manufacturing, said Ms Chia.\n\n\"As the state of the manufacturing landscape changes, the government's planning and land use definitions of what is considered suitable and allowable in industrial premises need to reflect uses that are traditionally not industrial activities, but, nonetheless contribute to some stage of a product's life cycle in today's technology-based platforms,\" she said.\n\nBut while the government is open to \"refining\" what activities can go into the approved uses of different industrial facilities, redefinition is not on the cards.\n\n\"We look at (industrial definitions) continuously,\" said Png Cheong Boon, chief executive officer of JTC Corp. \"But if the new industry's facilities can fit into B1 or B2, I think we would be hesitant to change (these definitions) because once we change it there are significant implications in terms of land values, etc. What's more important is to make sure we continue to refine what activities can go into B1 and B2 rather than trying to change the zoning.\"\n\nKurt Wee, president of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME), welcomed the news that there would be more industrial space, even though he noted that of the three real estate spectrums - industrial space, office space, and retail and F&B space - industrial was one of the less problematic areas for businesses.\n\n\"This is very welcome but what we need is a kind of framework that helps to regulate rent increases at sustainable levels. In any business, when your rent goes up by 50-100 per cent, it's just not something that is acceptable,\" said Mr Wee.\n\nAccording to Nicholas Mak, head of research at SLP International, while there is some shortage in the market, it is predominantly in niche areas, such as food factories, strata-titled warehouse space, factory units for chemical processing, and strata-titled factories with ancillary dormitories for workers.\n\n\"The government needs a 'rifle' approach to solve the current problem, not a 'shotgun' approach,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But the benefits to Japan's trade balance, which has been in the red for the past 10 months, would be limited as the country's export competitiveness is seen to be declining, analysts say.\n\n\"As a whole, costs stemming from the consumption tax hike have been smoothly passed on to product prices,\" Kyodo news services quoted Tsutomu Saito, an economist at the Daiwa Institute of Research in Tokyo, as saying upon the release of the latest inflation data.\n\nKyodo also reported that the BOJ expected to retain its outlook for inflation, excluding the impact of the consumption tax hike, to rise to around 2 per cent annually in the second half of the current fiscal year to March 2015. The BOJ is expected to project 2 per cent inflation in both fiscal 2015 and 2016.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

POSH received 8,567 valid applications for a total of 211.2 million shares on offer, earning the company $242.9 million.\n\nIts international offering received strong institutional support; all 186.82 million offering shares were taken up, excluding the 25.2 million reserved shares, which were fully subscribed and/or purchased by the company's directors, management, employees, its subsidiaries and joint ventures, as well as parent company Kuok (Singapore) Ltd and its subsidiaries, such as Pacific Carriers Ltd (PCL), which have contributed to the success of the group.\n\nIn total, POSH's offering of 252.02 million shares was approximately three times subscribed.\n\nThe IPO raised gross proceeds of about $388.3 million for the company. If the overallotment option of 46.1 million shares granted by PCL is exercised in full, the total gross proceeds raised by POSH will hit $441.3 million, even though it will not receive net proceeds from the exercise of this option.\n\nSpeaking at the listing launch of the stock at SGX yesterday, POSH chairman Kuok Khoon Ean, the son of Robert Kuok, said: \"I am very pleased to note that many blue-chip institutions have chosen to invest in POSH and participate in the company's future growth. Indeed, even retail investors have voted with their funds, as evidenced by the total subscription monies submitted for the 40 million offering shares under the public tranche.\"\n\nHe added that the company had come a long way from when it diversified from bulk shipping activities into offshore marine services in 2006. Since then, POSH has grown its total asset base from US$35 million to US$1.8 billion at the end of last year.\n\nWith yesterday's listing, its market capitalisation grew to about S$2.1 billion. Mr Kuok told reporters yesterday that the company's vision is to expand its international operating footprint, specifically in Africa and Latin America, using its presence in West Africa and Mexico as launch pads.\n\nHe said acquisitions are not on the cards in the near term, though he does not rule them out down the road.\n\nThe listing of POSH takes the number of listed companies within the Kuok Group to six: Kerry Properties, Shangri-la Asia and the SCMP Group (publisher of the South China Morning Post) in Hong Kong; the PPB Group and Malaysian Bulk Carriers in Malaysia; and POSH on SGX.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Within that box are numerous partitioned sections containing symbolic objects such as a gramophone, an aquarium, a patch of lallang grass, a wayang kulit scene, and a broadcasting station. Light illuminates various portions of the box at different times to reveal secrets and surprises.\n\nThere are also a few \"wax figures\". Some of these figures are played by actors who speak but don't move, move sporadically, or move in a strange fashion as to suggest a puppet or a toy whose actions are being controlled. The actors are Bani Haykal, Hiro Machida, Rizman Putra and Sim Pern Yiau.\n\nJust like any assemblage box, these figures and objects together tell a story. In this case, it is the story of the Malayan tiger in its various mythological incarnations - as a creature that once prowled Singapore's dense jungles; as a nickname for the shadowy Malayan Communist Party leader Lai Teck (1901-1947); and as the nickname also for General Tomoyuki Yamashita (1885-1946) who led the Japanese invasion of Singapore and Malaya from 1941 to 1942.\n\nBeyond these historical links, however, Ho also employs the Malayan tiger as a brilliant symbol for Singapore's forgotten past, faded antiquities and erased histories. The tiger, after all, once proudly roamed this island but has long been extinct here. The tiger thus represents all that is lost through human action.\n\nThe opening lines of Ten Thousand Tigers states that \"what we know about ourselves largely come from spies, traitors... The art of the narrative belongs to the police\". Like other iconoclastic artists of his generation (such as Choy Ka Fai and Alfian Sa'at), Ho suggests that Singapore's history - at least the version told in textbooks - is not accurate, and that parts of it may been revised to serve the needs of those in power. While such provocations are intriguing, Ho does not develop the metaphor beyond strong statements posed throughout the work. The message is often unvarying, just as the work's pace and tone remain flat.\n\nHo's strength, without doubt, is his grasp of a broad range of visual, theatrical and cinematic techniques. He is, after all, one of the few Singaporeans whose films have been screened at the Cannes Film Festival. His use of sound, lights and images intermittently create a visually arresting work of art - even if its deeper, thematic concerns never quite take off.\n\nThat said, Ten Thousand Tigers is certainly a strong and stylish curtain-raiser to mark the start of Esplanade's new season of Studio productions, which include Red, a play about artist Mark Rothko; Butterfly, an adaptation of Madame Butterfly by Ramesh Meyappan; and #UnicornMoment, a new play by Checkpoint Theatre (see other story).\n\nOne hopes that when Ten Thousand Tigers takes to the stage again later this year in Vienna, Sydney and Gwangju, it will find time to sharpen its claws and strengthen its script.\n\nFor more information of Esplanade Studio's new season of works, go to\n\nthestudios.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We have confidence in China. Whatever short-term challenges there may be, we are confident that the chief executive officer will be able to handle, respond (to) and overcome them.\"\n\nHe turned to chief executive Samuel Tsien for a comment, but not before adding that Mr Tsien could probably answer questions on Wing Hang \"in his sleep\".\n\nMr Tsien, responding, told shareholders that OCBC will maintain the quality of its loan portfolio, even with the $6.23 billion acquisition of Wing Hang announced on April 1.\n\nHe noted that Wing Hang's non-performing loan ratio was at 0.44 per cent - even lower than OCBC's 0.7 per cent.\n\n\"We expect that the portfolio quality will be maintained at a satisfactory rate,\" he said.\n\nIn response to a shareholder's query on property loans and the impact of the government's cooling measures on the market, Mr Tsien said that new housing loan origination had fallen by about 40 per cent from the heyday about two years ago, but that the bank was still working on previously contracted loan commitments.\n\nOCBC also expects to expand other business activities to offset the weakness in the property loans segment, which is expected to be particularly felt by the middle of next year.\n\nAll resolutions were passed at the meeting.

However, cargo traffic is likely to grow at a slower clip than passenger demand.\n\nSeventy-six per cent of those polled said passenger traffic would rise in the next year, a stronger response than the 72 per cent who had made that projection in the last survey in January.\n\nOn the cargo front, the outlook is also positive, with 56 per cent of respondents expecting an increase in demand over the next 12 months.\n\n\"This is the biggest expected rate of increase since mid-2010, a very strong year for cargo,\" the Iata report highlighted.\n\nBut while passenger yields - which appear to have dipped year-on-year in Q1 - will increase slightly in the year ahead, cargo yields - which also declined in Q1 in line with softer load factors - could ease in the next year or so.\n\nWhere profitability is concerned, more than half (52 per cent) reported seeing stronger profitability in Q1 over the year-ago period. Some 30 per cent experienced a decline in profits, up from the 25 per cent in the January survey.\n\nAbout 60 per cent expect profitability to improve over the next one year, lower than the 70 per cent who said the same at the last survey.\n\nSurvey respondents also said that input costs had declined during the first quarter, pointing to cost-cutting initiatives, and these costs are expected to fall further over the next 12 months.\n\nWith a stronger financial performance on the cards for airlines, employment activity is expected to rise over the next year, those polled said. However, in Q1, employment remained flat compared with the same period a year earlier.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The query was despatched at 3.06pm, at which time the shares traded at $1.13, a gain of 10.5 cents, or about 10 per cent.\n\nSMRT's reply was filed at 6.20pm, in which it said that it did not know of reasons for the interest in its shares.\n\nBrokers said that there was speculation of an impending fare hike, or that the company was going to be nationalised. However, local house CIMB said in a note that it believes that SMRT is making inroads with regulators regarding the accounting of asset transfers under the new rail-financing framework and this could be concluded soon.\n\n\"The end result will be predictable cash flows and a more sustainable financing model, which will alter the fate of the company,\" said CIMB.\n\n\"Under the new rail financing framework, LTA (Land Transport Authority) will collect a licence charge that the operator will pay for the right to run, and generate returns from the revenue service. The monies received will be pooled together to replace and enhance operating equipment such as trains, signalling systems and other operating assets for operating the Railway Transport System.\"\n\nThe broker said that the licence charge comprises fixed and variable components, with the former calibrated to take into account factors such as the viability of the line, its long-term operational and maintenance needs, and the benefits and costs that the line is likely to bring to/impose on the rest of the railway network. The variable component ensures the appropriate level of risk-sharing between government and the operator.\n\n\"CIMB has modelled in a significant amount of service enhancement works that would be completed within the next 24 months. . . leading to margin recovery in FY15F. As such, the house sees a 36 per cent year on year improvement on core net profit (FY15 net profit $84 million).\"\n\nIt added that the shift/change in business model would go a long way into reversing SMRT's bus losses 12 to 18 months from now and significantly improve margins, earnings and cash flows.\n\nFor SMRT's third quarter ended Dec 31, 2013, profit after tax and minority interests fell 44 per cent year on year to $14.2 million. It suffered a $9 million loss on its fare business while bus losses rose from $7 million to $8.9 million.\n\nPresident and chief executive officer Desmond Kuek has said that the impact of rising costs will be mitigated partly next year by new fare adjustments and higher productivity and cost efficiency.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But no deal was announced at the joint press conference.\n\n\"We are closer to agreement on issues like automobiles and agriculture,\" Mr Obama said in relation to talks on cutting bilateral tariffs. Japan wants to retain tariffs on farm products, rice, wheat, beef and pork, and sugar and dairy products, but the US argues this would set a precedent that could damage TPP agreements.\n\nFurther negotiations on the TPP are scheduled for next month in Singapore and the assumption is that US and Japanese negotiators will now step up their efforts to reach an agreement on a bilateral deal before the Singapore sessions.\n\nThe US and Japanese leaders stood side by side at a press conference held at the official government guest house in Tokyo and referred to each other repeatedly on first name terms, underlying their attempts to cast relations between the two countries in the most favourable possible light.\n\n\"The Japan-US alliance has never been so solid,\" said Mr Abe, while Mr Obama offered the first public commitment by a US president that Washington would come to the aid of Japan in the event that the disputed Senkaku Islands were threatened by outside powers.\n\nThe islands have historically been administered by Japan, Mr Obama pointed out. \"We do not believe that they should be subject to change unilaterally,\" he added. \"What is a consistent part of the alliance is that the treaty covers all territories administered by Japan.\"\n\nMr Abe declared meanwhile that he and Mr Obama had agreed that the two allies would not tolerate any attempt to alter the status quo by force or coercion, a message that Kyodo suggested was aimed at restraining the behaviour of China and Russia in the East China Sea and Ukraine, respectively.\n\n\"Strengthening the US-Japan alliance is very much in the interests of the regional peace and security,\" Mr Abe suggested at the joint press conference, which was also attended by US ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy.\n\n\"I believe president Obama is passionate about strengthening the US-Japan alliance,\" Mr Abe said. \"I believe in his passion and I trust the United States. That trust has become even stronger with today's summit.\"\n\n\"As for China,\" added Mr Abe, \"we agreed to cooperate so as to involve China in our endeavour to develop a free and open Asia-Pacific region based on the rule of law and to work together to bring China into that.\"\n\nMr Obama for his part described China as \"a critical country not just to the region but the world . . . We want to continue to encourage the peaceful rise of China,\" he said. \"But what we have also emphasised . . . is that all of us have responsibilities to help maintain the basic rules of the road and international order.\"\n\nHe noted also that \"the (mutual security) treaty between the United States and Japan preceded my birth so obviously it isn't a red line that I'm drawing\". \"There is no change in position. There is no red line that has been drawn. We are simply applying the treaty.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

As such, the majority of CMA's board should not be considered independent, Mr Dee argued.\n\nBut SIAS noted that all non-independent directors of CMA are excluded from evaluating the offer. The Independent Board Committee reviewing the deal consists of directors who are independent of CapitaLand and it is helmed by lead independent director, Loo Choon Yong, co-founder of the Raffles Medical Group.\n\n\"SIAS also understands that SIC (Securities Industry Council) has approved the independence of these directors. On this basis, SIAS is satisfied that there is independence in the review of the offer and minority shareholder interest has been addressed sufficiently,\" Mr Gerald said.\n\nDeclining to take a view on valuations, SIAS deems it more prudent for shareholders to wait for the IFA (independent financial advisor) report from Deutsche Bank to make an informed decision.\n\nAnalysts' reports have differed on their sum- of-parts valuations, with some analysts suggesting a higher valuation. But analysts all acknowledged that CMA has not traded above $2.22 in the past three years.\n\nWhen CMA was listed in November 2009 at $2.12 apiece, it was debt-free and all the pre-IPO debt was assumed by CapitaLand, thus providing CMA with debt headroom for growth, SIAS pointed out.\n\nMarket conditions have also changed since CMA's listing. Religare Capital Markets said in a recent note that a potential China slowdown, lack of capital recycling direction, and competition from e-commerce would render CMA unable to provide the 20 per cent upside that the privatisation deal offers.\n\nWhen approached by BT, CapitaLand's spokeswoman said the group is unable to comment during this offer period. \"We advise CMA shareholders to wait for the IFA report. The Offer document will be sent next week.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

One is an accreditation programme for small but innovative startups and the other is the official inauguration of the IDA Labs initiative to foster interest in technology and collaboration among Singaporeans, especially young students.\n\nThe Accreditation@IDA initiative aims to help innovative technology startups build up their credentials so that they can be positioned as qualified vendors capable of handling projects by government agencies and large enterprises.\n\nAccording to IDA, the Labs, located at IDA's headquarters at Mapletree Business City and the National Design Centre (NDC) will serve as a place to experiment, collaborate and build innovative products and solutions that address real world challenges. A third lab, to be housed in one of the National Library Board's (NLB) facilities, is also being planned.\n\n\"IDA Labs and the Accreditation@IDA programme are two examples of how we want to help in practical ways to support the building of some great tech-product companies,\" said Steve Leonard, IDA's executive deputy chairman.\n\nMr Leonard said that the accreditation programme will help promising and innovative Singapore-based technology startups with a turnover of under $10 million. The programme is looking for startups which are involved mainly in enterprise software products. However, that does not preclude hardware vendors with software in their devices.\n\nThe project also hopes to provide potential buyers (of products made by these companies) an assurance on the companies' products and ability to deliver. The aim is to facilitate the government's innovation procurement from these accredited companies and this accreditation will act as a substitute for criterion such as EPPU (expenditure and procurement policies unit) financial grading which benchmarked on revenue and net tangible assets.\n\nTarget companies have to be Singapore-based with a track record of developing their own innovative high-growth infocomm products for the enterprise market. Among other criteria, the companies should own the IP (Intellectual Property) or patent for the product or software and not be a reseller or distributor.\n\nThe accreditation programme will be open for application from July this year. Companies' financial performance and operational capabilities will also be taken into account in the process. Successful companies would be awarded an accredited status for 18 months. IDA hopes that after that period these companies will be able to strike out on their own.\n\nIT service providers Hewlett Packard (HP) and Cognizant will provide the software testing tools, along with accreditation best-practices and methodologies, at an accreditation lab set up within the lab at the IDA headquarters.\n\nMr Leonard noted that IDA Labs is partnering Red Hat to provide users with advice from specialists and the open source community. IDA Labs and Red Hat will also organise an international challenge to discover innovative technology projects that not only meet functional requirements, but which are also user-friendly and design-centric. IDA Labs is also working with Intel to provide its latest technologies, R&D (research and development) resources and technical expertise to IDA Labs users. Intel will also help local ICT (information and communications technology) companies bring their products to overseas markets via its global platforms.\n\nSpeaking at the inauguration of the IDA Labs, Yaacob Ibrahim, Minister for Communications and Information, noted that it will be a platform where IDA and government agencies can partner the industry to experiment and develop new solutions. \"IDA Labs will also excite and attract young Singaporeans, from those in primary schools to students at the institutes of higher learning, to tinker, build, and fix with technology.\"\n\nThe minister added that with the support of the Ministry of Education (MOE), IDA Labs will hold the Learn@Labs Day from May 27 to 29 this year. IDA Labs will also be working with the Institute of Innovation and Entrepreneurship at the Singapore Management University (SMU), to provide a platform for the SMU community including students, faculty and alumni members to test their ideas.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Each has its own distinctive style and there's a wide range to sample from as the 2nd Singapore Chinese Film Festival heads into its final stretch this weekend.\n\nWhile Jia Zhangke's A Touch of Sin (mainland China's answer to Oliver Stone's hyper-violent Natural Born Killers) and aerial photographer Chi Po Lin's breathtaking documentary Beyond Beauty: Taiwan From Above are sold out, there are still a handful of films with tickets available that are worth checking out.\n\nMalaysian singer-songwriter-filmmaker Namewee's Kara King (Malaysia, 2013) fills the \"mo lei tau\" (nonsensical) void left by Hong Kong actor-director Stephen Chow, who pioneered the genre.\n\nThe slapstick comedy stars Ng Man Tat, who was a frequent collaborator with Chow in the latter's early films, and also features the late Taiwanese pop star Frankie Gao in his final film role.\n\nBoth of them play karaoke champions who run into each other decades later to settle an old score in a sing-off. Like most of Namewee's films, it's a colourful and zany affair with the characters often breaking into song and dance. But it's also a heartfelt and nostalgic tribute to the \"mo lei tau\" genre, one that is bursting with comic energy and has been sorely missing from Chinese cinema since Chow went into semi-retirement mode.\n\nEqually energetic is The Way We Dance (Hong Kong, 2013), a sleeper summer hit that smashed domestic box-office records and won rave reviews for putting the territory's underground street dance scene in the spotlight.\n\nSpunky newcomer Cherry Ngan is a hoot to watch as she twerks and crunks through the film together with a cast of raw talents handpicked by director Adam Wong from over 500 real-life street dancers. With hip hop moves and beats this infectious, the audience might just find it a little difficult to remain still in their seats.\n\nFor something a little more sedate, try The Long Goodbye (Taiwan, 2011), Yang Li Chou's documentary about dementia patients living in an old folks' home.\n\nThe Golden-Horse-winning director trains his camera on a few interesting subjects including a woman who might have lost her memory but not her sense of humour, an ill-tempered man whose personality has softened since he was struck with the disease, and a constantly paranoid patient who believes he's living in Communist-era Taiwan.\n\nHeartbreaking and touching at once, The Long Goodbye looks at an important issue which nobody really wants to talk about but could eventually become much more common as Asia's ageing population begins to rise. Stay for the coda where Ella Chen from popular Taiwanese pop trio S.H.E. shares her own experience about losing her grandmother to dementia.\n\nRatings\n\nKara King:\n\nB-\n\nThe Way We Dance:\n\nB\n\nThe Long Goodbye:\n\nB+\n\nFor timings and ticketing details, check\n\nhttp://www.sfs.org.sg/scff/schedule.html\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Unitholders' distribution slipped 3 per cent to $26.7 million, due to the absence of the forex gain.\n\nNet asset value per unit fell to $1.36 at March 31 this year, from $1.37 at Dec 31, 2013. The counter closed unchanged at $1.23 yesterday. ART's results were announced before the market opening. The trust will pay its DPU for Q1 together with that for Q2 later this year.\n\nIn Q1 2014, ART acquired its first serviced residence in Dalian and a second property in Fukuoka after the December rights issue.\n\n\"With a stronger balance sheet, we are able to pursue acquisitions efficiently to maximise returns for unitholders. We will continue to look for acquisitions in key gateway cities in China, Japan, Malaysia, Australia and Europe,\" said Lim Jit Poh, chairman of Ascott Residence Trust Management Limited (ARTML).\n\n\"We expect our properties' performance to remain stable as the global economy strengthens. Ascott Reit's extended stay business model and geographical diversification will continue to provide income stability,\" he added.\n\nARTML's CEO Ronald Tay said: \"Besides acquisitions which led to revenue growth, we saw strong performance for our operations in several markets. Revenue per available unit (RevPAU) for Japan, United Kingdom and Belgium grew 18 per cent, 13 per cent and 11 per cent respectively in local currencies. This was mainly due to strong demand from corporate and leisure travellers. We are also seeing signs of improvement for our properties in Singapore and Vietnam due to higher demand from executives on project assignments.\"\n\nThe trust's RevPAU in Singapore dollars, however, remained unchanged at $124 per day in Q1 2014 from a year ago.\n\nThe ongoing refurbishment of Ascott Raffles Place Singapore and Somerset Olympic Tower Tianjin will be completed this year. The trust will also begin refurbishing Somerset Ho Chi Minh City, Citadines Barbican London and phase two renovation of Somerset Xu Hui Shanghai.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Even better, playwright Goh Boon Teck, songwriter Don Richmond and director Beatrice Chia-Richmond have adapted and condensed Neo's overly-long duology into a highly-watchable and compact two-hour stage production.\n\nAs with any good musical, the key lies in the songs and Richmond's Ah Boys to Men The Musical originals hit the spot most of the time.\n\nWritten in a mix of English, Singlish, Mandarin and Hokkien - much like the show's dialogue itself - they range from Broadway-style showstoppers (Tekong Tekan, Life is Beautiful) to radio-friendly ballads (a Jay Chou-ish Brothers Forever) and even a bit of rap (SOC), where local rapper Shiggashay and Tosh Zhang get to battle it out B-boy style on-stage. Not only that, Richmond has also breathed new life into NS standards like Bookout Day and Training To Be Soldiers, rearranging them into memorable show tunes.\n\nEven the actors, who mostly are reprising their roles here, seem to have improved. While Zhang, Wang Weiliang, Maxi Lim and Noah Yap's acting once looked raw on the big screen, they have become more polished now.\n\nPerhaps that's also because their tendency to overact to get into their larger-than-life roles isn't as obvious on stage so it doesn't look as unnatural as it did in the film.\n\nBut what hasn't changed is the cast's chemistry even though the original Recruit Ken Chow, Joshua Tan, has been replaced by Benjamin Kheng, from local folk-pop band The Sam Willows. The latter handles the central role comfortably and as a real-life musician, has natural stage presence, besides also boasting the best voice.\n\nBy and large, Goh's adaptation stays faithful to the original coming-of-age story about Chow's enlistment but the playwright has also introduced a bit more comedy to the script, mainly through two new characters - comedian Chua En Lai handling the more risque jokes as a Filipino domestic worker; and Joshua Lim with his spot-on Mainland Chinese-accented English as a new citizen.\n\nWhile character development is grossly sacrificed to keep things compact over two acts, Ah Boys To Men The Musical has a good mix of humour and drama; and moves along at a breezy pace.\n\nIt's not the kind of theatre that will win awards - the sets are a little too clunky and, like Neo's films, names of the sponsors are blatantly slipped into the script.\n\nBut it also doesn't pretend to be anything more than what it is and a guilty pleasure.\n\nYou don't even have to worry about getting tekan-ed in Tekong because all you'll have is a tokong time.\n\n'Ah Boys To Men The Musical' will run till May 4 at Resorts World Theatre in Sentosa.

The selected artist will be Charles Lim, for his ongoing artwork, Sea State, curated by Shabbir Hussain Mustafa.\n\nSingapore pulled out of the 55th Venice Biennale last year, despite having taken part at the iconic biennale since 2001.\n\nCommenting on Singapore's re-participation, Lawrence Wong, Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, says Singapore is working towards a long-term lease of a pavilion space at the Biennale, to \"give greater stability to our presence, and a longer lead time to plan and commission artworks to be presented\".\n\nHe was speaking at the opening of the show, Medium at Large, at Singapore Art Museum yesterday. The ministry has plans to provide $20 million over the next five years towards international exchanges, including the Venice Biennale.\n\nIn all, eight proposals were submitted to a panel co-chaired by NAC CEO Kathy Lai and Eugene Tan, director of the National Gallery. Lim and Mustafa's proposal was the strongest, says Dr Tan.\n\nLim's Sea State has been widely exhibited to critical acclaim. The former national sailor won a prize at the 2011 Venice Film Festival for his experimental short film All The Lines Flow Out, the first Singaporean to do so; and prior to that at Documenta 11, as part of the net art collective\n\ntsunamii.net\n\n.\n\nMustafa is curator at the National Gallery, where he researches art from Singapore and South-east Asia.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Spanish wines have long been well known, chiefly through the Spanish house of Torres. They were indeed as easily available as French wines, especially the Rioja in their flask-shaped round-bottom bottles in wicker baskets. We used to try those wines - they were easily available, inexpensive, and if you did not like the wine, you simply poured it into the sink and used the bottle as a flower vase!\n\nRIESLING SCHLOSSBERG GRAND CRU, CUVEE STE CATHERINE 1998, DOMAINE WEINBACH\n\nBrilliant golden colour, 18 carats worth! Soft rich fruity aromas of very ripe fruit - ripe apples and pears - very characteristic of an old white. But no keroseney aromas. Sweet entry on palate, good volume and density of wine, with a fine acidic spine of freshness in the background. Very complex, also very elusive when you try and track down the aromas and flavours. But a beautiful wine.\n\nShould this have been drunk earlier? Yes it could have been, preferably at eight to 10 years of age, when it would have been at its vigorous peak. At 16 years, it has mellowed, becoming a vinous elder statesman! It gained in complexity, but lost a little of its sharpness.\n\nThis wine went very well with the first two courses: cod fish bechamel and Spanish omelette with potato and onion - two very characteristically Spanish dishes.\n\nVALBUENA 2003, BODEGA VEGA SICILIA\n\nDeep red centre becoming progressively more and more brownish going out towards the edge. A very fine almost delicate bouquet of ripe berry fruit, tinted with hints of lime; medium-bodied, filling the mouth with a delicious-tasting, full-flavoured liquid packed with ripe fruit, lovely acidity. Well balanced, and good smooth follow-through. Thoroughly enjoyable, very satisfying.\n\nValbuena is released earlier than Vega, after five years maturing in cask. As seen in this bottle, it is already beautifully ready to drink, and has the additional advantage of being much cheaper.\n\nMAS LA PLANA 2002, MIGUEL TORRES\n\nOpaque black-red from centre to rim; a rich intense nose of very ripe berry fruit, with hints of cedar wood in the background. Very rich, intensely concentrated taste, thick dense texture, perfectly ripe fruit, great freshness and finishing smooth and long. One could taste the Cabernet Sauvignon flavour in the background coming through on the palate, dense and smooth. Very very good indeed. And very characteristic of this label.\n\nThis wine was (and still is) Torres' flagship wine. It was originally labelled Torres Black Label, and then underwent two changes. The first change was to Gran Coronas Mas La Plana, and this was later shortened to Mas La Plana. It was with this wine that Torres shot to fame. The Torres Black Label 1970 won the blind tasting of Cabernet Sauvignons in Gault and Millau's Wine Olympics in 1979, beating Chateau Latour 1970 into second place. That triumph put Torres and Black Label firmly on the world map. The wine is 100 per cent Cabernet Sauvignon today, aged in 100 per cent new American oak for 21 months. This 2002 edition fully fulfilled all expectations. Twelve years old, still youthful, it will go on a further 20 years. The slight touch of softness around the edges, the additional richness and softness identified it as non-Bordeaux.\n\nOne final and very important advantage that it has over Chateau Latour: Mas La Plana 2002's average price today is 39 euros (S$68). Chateau Latour 2002 is around 495 euros. One case of Mas La Plana to one bottle of Chateau Latour. No contest - perhaps!\n\nL'ERMITA 2000, ALVARO PALACIOS\n\nEighty per cent Garnacha, 16 per cent Cabernet Sauvignon, 4 per cent Carinena. Fifteen months in French oak.\n\nThis was very, very good. Black-red opaque colour, with a soft full, almost voluptuous nose of very ripe, very fresh berry fruit, hints of ripe plums, and coffee in the background. Very complex intriguing aromas, full of ripe fruit aromas. On the palate, a very big and very dense wine, very ripe fruit, with flavours of plums, cherries, liquorice and black coffee; well balanced with thick richness nicely counterbalanced by very good freshness. This balance and the good freshness with smooth thick texture and complexity made it very enjoyable. I was very impressed by the great freshness, considering how the whole wine was so thick, so dense, so rich and so powerful. In a way, it was rather like the Mas La Plana, but much more complex and richer.\n\nL'Ermita comes from 100-year-old vines grown in a small single vineyard, north-east facing, on a hillside in Gratallops. One of Spain's most expensive and most famous wines, belonging in the modern generation of Spanish wines which are seriously challenging French wines.\n\nThese four wines are the kind of wines that I like. They are well-made, coming as they do from four of the finest wine producers; they have beautiful seductive aromas and they are very enjoyable in the mouth and after swallowing, making you reach out for another mouthful.\n\nAre they available, are they expensive? The first three are not. The last one is. But more importantly, are they available currently? Domaine Weinbach's Rieslings should not be difficult to find, if not here then certainly in England. The bottle described here was bought at the Domaine in May 2000. Weinbach do cellar-door sales but that would mean a trip to Alsace, and it would be mainly the current vintages.\n\nIncidentally, the red wines were great with the Spanish roast suckling pig!\n\nFootnote: Bodega Vega Sicilia's distributor is Vinum Fine Wines.

Eight new stores which opened in 2012 contributed 2.7 per cent of that growth.\n\nComparable same-store sales accounted for the other 3 per cent, but could have been higher if not for construction work near two stores, the company said yesterday.\n\nGross margin crept up from 22.5 per cent to 23.8 per cent, boosted by lower input costs, higher selling prices and adjustment to rebates received from suppliers.\n\nAdministration expenses rose 7.1 per cent as the grocer increased provision for higher staff bonuses as a result of the quarter's positive performance.\n\nSheng Siong's expansion has been limited by its ability to find suitable retail space, with no new stores opened in all of 2013 and the past quarter.\n\nSheng Siong chief executive officer Lim Hock Chee said the group will continue to look for space, especially in areas where the retailer does not have a presence.\n\nDespite increasing inflationary pressures and foreign labour restrictions, Mr Lim was \"encouraged\" by cost savings from the firm's Mandai Distribution Centre, which allows Sheng Siong to increase direct purchases and bulk handling.\n\n\"We will also leverage technology to reduce the need for labour, improve productivity and to reduce business costs,\" Mr Lim said.\n\nThe counter closed half a cent higher at 60 cents yesterday, before the results were announced.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Aircrafts movements grew 4.5 per cent to 86,300 while cargo shipments were flat at 446,900 tonnes.\n\nIn contrast, Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) chalked up passenger growth of 16 per cent to 12.3 million in Q1 2014, fuelled by carriers such as Malaysia Airlines, budget carrier AirAsia and long-haul budget airline AirAsia X, noted CAPA (Centre for Aviation) analyst Brendan Sobie in a report.\n\nIn particular, AirAsia X has been expanding its network, which is serving KLIA well as the low-cost carrier (LCC) drives transit traffic through the airport.\n\nOn the other hand, Singapore-based LCCs Tigerair and Scoot see low volumes of transfer traffic, despite offering joint itineraries for over a year now. The two carriers, which have also applied to the Competition Commission of Singapore for approval to coordinate on areas such as scheduling, will need to work together to build a stronger partnership, the report suggested.\n\n\"If Scoot and Tigerair were able to follow the AirAsia X/AirAsia model in pursuing transit traffic, Changi could easily see a double-digit increase in LCC traffic without having to rely on its increasingly mature local short-haul LCC sector,\" wrote Mr Sobie. \"But if Changi does not succeed at attracting this new segment, traffic will likely grow in the low single digits over the short to medium term.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Hong Kong-listed Chinese financial services company launched its maiden, $400 million 31/2-year bond issue yesterday, pricing it at 4.25 per cent.\n\nThe final order book was $3.8 billion, almost 10 times subscribed, said DBS Bank, one of the two joint lead managers, along with Standard Chartered Bank, for the deal.\n\nAlthough this was the firm's first Singapore dollar (SGD) bond, it has been active in other bond markets, said Clifford Lee, DBS head of fixed income.\n\n\"FEH is an investment-grade name with strong parentage and also a known repeat issuer in the USD, offshore RMB and HKD bond markets. FEH is therefore not a new name to investors but this is indeed their maiden SGD bond.\"\n\nFEH is the flagship unit of China's state-owned Sinochem Group's financial division. Sinochem is the country's largest trading company.\n\n\"The fact that we have almost equal distribution between private bank and institutional investor bases shows a broad-based acceptance of this, credit notwithstanding,\" Mr Lee said.\n\nIn addition, more discerning investors shrugged off slower growth in the world's second-largest economy and the impact on debt repayments of some companies. China grew 7.4 per cent in the first quarter this year, the weakest since Q2 2012.\n\n\"Recent China-linked deals over these past few weeks showed strong reception. So altogether, they show continued interest in strong credits out of China,\" said Mr Lee.\n\nThis month, China's state-owned giants minted some of Asia's largest debt transactions.\n\nOn April 2, China Petrochemical Corp, also known as Sinopec, issued US$5 billion of bonds in multiple tranches - the largest Asian debt sale in more than a decade. It was followed by China National Offshore Oil Corporation's US$4 billion issuance this week. Also this week, Tencent Holdings sold US$2.5 billion in bonds, the largest tech bond issue from Asia ex-Japan.\n\nInvestors for FEH's maiden SGD bond came overwhelmingly from Asia (98 per cent). By allocation, private banks had 52 per cent of the issue, fund managers 24 per cent, life insurers 17 per cent and banks 7 per cent.\n\nFEH has a BBB-stable rating from Standard & Poor's and the bonds are expected to be rated BBB-.\n\nAccording to its website, FEH is an integrated financial service organisation in China that provides customised, one-stop financial solutions through financial leasing and other value-added services.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Now I'm licensed to!\" says the gleeful 46-year-old who is also a music producer, singer and actor.\n\nInnamorati (which means \"lover\" in Italian), will be staged by local theatre company Toy Factory Productions in July.\n\nThe storyline\n\nInnamorati weaves together 12 of Eric's most popular original compositions including Wei Yi (You Are My Only) and Tai Sha (Too Silly), with a storyline that follows the ups and downs of seven emerging young singers trying to make it in the 21st-century music industry. The stories were developed based on interviews with the seven cast members, who are young aspiring musicians or singers themselves and know first-hand the struggles of trying to succeed in the business.\n\nAllan says his brother felt honoured when he first heard about the musical and they toyed with the idea of him making a cameo, but found that it would be difficult schedule-wise as Eric is currently based in China.\n\nThe show's director, Goh Boon Teck, says that one of his reasons for doing this musical is partly to pay tribute to Eric, whom he calls an inspiration to Singapore singers for the perseverance that took him where he is today.\n\n\"Every other day, I have singers who come and tell me they are going to sell insurance, or set up a restaurant or hawker stall. But if you know you are really born to do something in music, you can do it. You just have to push yourself,\" says Goh, 42.\n\nThe other reason is that he wanted the opportunity to introduce the younger generation to the music he grew up with.\n\nHe explains: \"I grew up with the songs, like most of us in our 30s and 40s have. They were from our school days and are mostly about heartbreak and love. So at that time when you have relationship problems, you will listen, and wish somebody could be your Wei Yi.\"\n\nTough job\n\nBut the task of rearranging the songs to make them appeal to the younger generation is one that falls to Allan as musical director - a job tougher than he had originally imagined. Admits Allan. \"I thought I was so familiar with the works, it would be a no-brainer.\"\n\n\"But as I work with it, I'm running into a lot of very tough decisions. . . I want to be able to really create something different yet retain that Eric Moo flavour. But if I change a guitar riff in one of the songs, what if it takes away too much of the song's identity?\" he says.\n\n\"The fact that he's my big brother means there's actually more pressure. If it was someone else, I could do whatever I want and get away with it. I don't have to face them. But Eric could just text me and say 'What did you do to my song?' I don't want that! So it's a hard line to draw,\" adds Allan.\n\nrachloi@sph.com.sg\n\n'Innamorati' runs from July 24 to Aug 3 at the Drama Centre Theatre, at 3pm on Tues, Fri and Sun, and 8pm from Wed to Sat.

While prices and rentals of industrial space continued to rise in the first quarter, the pace was significantly lower than the average annual increase in the past four years, according to data released by JTC Corporation yesterday.\n\nThe first quarter saw transaction prices of industrial space increase 3.8 per cent quarter on quarter and 2.5 per cent year on year, compared to an average annual growth of about 20 per cent in the last four years.\n\nIndustrial rentals rose 0.4 per cent quarter on quarter and 4.9 per cent year on year, compared to an average annual growth of about 10 per cent in the last four years.\n\nThe quarter saw occupancy rates of Singapore's industrial property market fall by 0.3 percentage points to 91.6 per cent from the previous quarter as supply outstripped demand.\n\nAt a briefing yesterday, the director of JTC's market planning division, Leong Hong Yew, said new supply of industrial space would bring a further decline in occupancy rates, which would help to rein in prices and rentals to a \"more affordable, more competitive level\".\n\nThe annual 2.1 million sq m of new industrial space planned for release each year is equivalent to about 4-5 per cent of the current available stock. It is about double the current average supply of 1.2 million sq m each year, and about triple the demand of 900,000 sq m in the past three years, JTC said.\n\nHowever, some analysts feel this might not address the issue fully, or head-on.\n\nSLP International research head Nicholas Mak said: \"More space that comes onstream doesn't affect prices, but rentals. Prices depend on industrial land buyers; rentals depend on completed space and arrangements between landlords and tenants.\" For this reason, he expects overall average industrial price changes to stay range-bound between minus 3 per cent and plus 5 per cent year on year in 2014.\n\nColliers International's director of research and advisory, Chia Siew Chuin, suggested that it was not so much the absolute lack of space for end users, but rather the definition of what was permitted under the industrial usage and planning guidelines that should be addressed.\n\n\"Some businesses that fall within grey areas in the manufacturing chain such as product testing and design are not allowed to use certain industrial spaces. Singapore has progressed from low-cost parts assembly to high-value, high-tech manufacturing. Yet, the government's planning regulations have not progressed in tandem. Blindly ramping up supply could result in a situation where we have a lot of vacant space that is irrelevant to today's economy and unusable by end users.\"\n\nEffective yesterday, JTC has also started to publish more transaction and rental information on its website to help industrialists make better purchase and rental decisions. Users can search down to the street or development level to find purchase and rental prices in the vicinity for transactions done in the past three years - for free.\n\nColliers' Ms Chia said the increased level of transparency would help end users sourcing for property for their business. \"It won't have a direct impact on prices and rentals, but people would be able to do some homework on their own and transact based on knowledge and not just hearsay. Buyers and sellers, tenants and landlords, will be better able to negotiate with each other.\"\n\nJTC also said it would continue releasing smaller land parcels averaging 0.5 hectares for industrialists to build their own customised facilities. Prices for these plots have stabilised to around $700-$750 per square metre per plot ratio (psm ppr), after hitting a high of about $1,000 psm ppr, Mr Leong said. More supply down the road will further moderate prices.\n\nCBRE research head Desmond Sim said JTC was responding to market needs. \"Our SMEs are not very land reliant and labour intensive. They require smaller plots to perform their functions through more micro machinery. With this, SMEs won't have to swallow something they can't chew. There will be good takers for these plots.\"\n\nJTC's CEO, Png Cheong Boon, said yesterday the whole exercise of ramping up supply was to avoid any more \"sharp spikes\" in prices. \"What industrialists want is certainty. They want to know what to expect, even if it means increasing prices, (at least) they know it's a gradual increase rather than a sudden increase that will destroy their projections. We are quite mindful of that.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Some 80 per cent earned $10,000 or less.\n\nECs are public-private hybrid built by private developers to allow eligible families to own a private condo at way below market price. First-timer households can enjoy a CPF Housing Grant and sales restrictions are fully lifted after 10 years.\n\nSince the income ceiling for ECs was raised from $10,000 to $12,000 in 2011, there was a shift in profile of EC buyers over a one-year period, Mr Khaw observed.\n\nThe proportion of second-timers rose from 43 per cent to 57 per cent and those aged between 35 and 44 increased from 35 per cent to 43 per cent. \"I will continue to make sure that the EC scheme stays on track, to serve the housing needs of Singaporeans,\" Mr Khaw said.\n\nRecent analysis of caveats by property consultants suggests that the proportion of private condos bought by HDB dwellers has increased gradually.\n\nIn the first quarter, about 45 per cent of all buyers of private condos have HDB addresses, up from 38 per cent in the same period in 2011. A higher proportion of these buyers with HDB addresses are going for smaller units of less than 800 sq ft.\n\nGiven the muted market conditions, developers are downsizing their units to make the overall price quantum of private condominiums more affordable for buyers, DTZ had said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The latter won a Laurence Olivier Award for best comedy in 1993, and the Evening Standard Award for best comedy in 1992.\n\nBut be prepared to see it in a new light when Pangdemonium Theatre Company presents its own version of The Rise & Fall of Little Voice, where it will be set in Singapore in the year 1974.\n\nExplains the show's director, Tracie Pang: \"We have always loved this timeless story of Little Voice. . . This shy young girl trying to find her own voice is a perfect personification of Singapore's own journey as a young nation finding our own place in the global landscape.\" And though she insists on keeping the details of the adaptation to herself so audiences will stay spoiler-free, Pang elaborates that \"there will certainly be time, place, and name references that Singaporeans will remember fondly\".\n\nThe musical stars theatre actress Mina Kaye as the titular character, and it follows her story as the timid and reclusive girl who hides a hidden talent for doing impersonations of famous divas such as Edith Piaf, Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe and Shirley Bassey. Along the way, she develops a romance with a boy named Billy (Shane Mardjuki), who's just as shy as she is. The plot really starts to thicken when her drunkard mother's (Denise Tan) sleazy \"talent-scout\" boyfriend Ray Say (Adrian Pang) discovers her talent and decides to put her under the spotlight.\n\nTo make things a bit more interesting, Pangdemonium is also offering a limited number of \"cabaret tables\" that will be placed right in front of the stage for a unique vantage point, plus drinks to add to the experience of being at an actual cabaret.\n\nAccording to Pang, even though this version of the musical is set four decades ago, the struggles of Little Voice as a young girl are still very much relevant in our very fast-paced Singapore society.\n\n\"Today everyone wants to be a star, and there are countless platforms to showcase talents - for better or for worse. . . And in our Asian context, the idea of the 'wannabe' and the 'Tiger Mother' is a lethal combination. The story of Little Voice explores this in a very entertaining, but also relatable way,\" she explains.\n\nUltimately, what Pang hopes for the show is not just for it to be entertaining, but also to convey a very \"human\" story that is contextualised for local audiences. \"At the end of the day, the story is one of empowerment and taking control of one's life. And we also want to show how a truly loving, accepting, and nurturing family is paramount for any individual,\" she adds.\n\n'The Rise & Fall of Little Voice' runs at the Drama Centre Theatre from May 2 to 18, at various timings. Regular tickets cost $30 to $88, and are available via\n\nwww.sistic.com.sg\n\n.

A 2011 big screen namesake reboot became their most successful cinematic outing ever, prompting this sequel which Kermit and gang are quick to acknowledge as a bit of a cash-grab in the movie's opening number, We're Doing a Sequel.\n\nBut that's just their good ol' self-referential humour kicking in early, with the lyrics warning this might not be half as good as the original. Unfortunately, they might have also spoken a little too soon. To be fair, the first film did set the bar very high with its zany energy, blink-and-you'll-miss-it celebrity cameos and outrageous laugh-a-minute gags.\n\nMuppets Most Wanted follows pretty much the same formula and is an entertaining romp; though the surprise factor is no longer as fresh. The wholesome goofiness of Jason Segel and Amy Adams from the first film - which gave it an all-ages appeal - is also missing because they've been replaced by Ricky Gervais (The Office) and Tina Fey (30 Rock). Both Gervais and Fey boast a broader comic range which they put to good use here but their following is slightly older because of their works on television so Muppets Most Wanted feels less family-oriented. Throw in a couple of Cold War references - the villain is a Russian frog and parts of the film take place in a Siberian Gulag - and it's almost as if returning director-writer James Bobin and co-writer Nicholas Stroller momentarily forgot about the kids this time round.\n\nThankfully, the Muppets aren't the Muppets if they are not up to some sort of mischief so all's not lost for the young ones. This time, they are lured on a transcontinental trek across Europe by a dodgy promoter Dominic Badguy (it's pronounced \"bad-ghee\" because it's French) played by Gervais, who promises to turn them into an international sensation.\n\nWhile in Berlin - where the fuzzy troupe's name translates hilariously into Die Muppets - Kermit ends up getting arrested because he's mistaken for his lookalike Constantine, the world's most dangerous frog that's just broken out of jail. As it turns out, both Constantine and Badguy are actually in cahoots and the Muppets tour he planned is just to cover up his grand plan of carrying out a series of heists across Europe.\n\nWith their identities now switched, Constantine becomes the Muppets' new leader while Kermit kills time behind bars by organising the Gulag's annual talent show with Nadya (Fey), a guard who cannot wait to unleash her inner showgirl. But when Constantine proceeds to sweep Miss Piggy off her feet and tries to marry her, Kermit is forced to take matters into his own hands as he plans his own prison break.\n\nIt's an old-fashioned madcap Muppets crime caper with plenty of slapstick comedy, sight gags and lively song-and-dance routines to keep the entertainment value as high as possible at all times. Bret McKenzie's musical numbers still shine and the endless stream of cameos (Lady Gaga, Tony Bennett, Celine Dion, Salma Hayek; the red-carpet-worthy list goes on) will keep the audience glued to the screen.\n\nMuppets Most Wanted has a tough act to follow because the first time pulled out all the stops. But anybody who grew up with this furry bunch and still has an inner child will know resisting the Muppets' classic comic charm is futile.\n\nRating:\n\nC+\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Over the next three to four years, the company hopes to cover 300 cities in Asia, from its current 120.\n\nIt will focus on three main product categories - lifestyle accessories, such as audio products; air purifiers and eco-friendly home appliances; as well as beauty and health products.\n\nSaid Inderbethal Singh Thakral, managing director of the distribution business, at a corporate update: \"We used to be a very heavily digital camera, digital products focused company till 2011.\"\n\nBut there was a decline of the industry in 2012 as mobile phone cameras gained popularity faster than anyone imagined, he added. \"That's when we started our transformation.\"\n\nThe group recorded a net loss attributable to equity holders of $101,000 for its fiscal year ended Dec 31, 2013, dragged down partly by its distribution business.\n\nReduced margins and allowances for aged inventory resulted in the distribution business posting a segmental loss of $4.1 million before interest and taxes (Ebit) last year, wider than the $0.8 million loss a year earlier.\n\nLoh Hoon Sun, managing director of Phillip Securities, said refocusing the distribution business to lifestyle products should benefit the company, but the level of success remained to be seen, as that industry is also competitive.\n\nThakral's investment division, which focuses on residential projects in Australia, has delivered better performance.\n\nSince it began in 2011, segmental profit (Ebit) for that division grew at a compounded annual growth rate of 30 per cent, reaching $9.6 million in FY2013.\n\nJaginder Singh Pasricha, managing director of investments and corporate, said this would not diminish in the foreseeable future.\n\nMoving forward, the division will look to diversify its asset classes, to include retail and commercial properties, as well as explore other investment locations, possibly Japan.\n\nIt will also develop platforms to tap cheaper sources of capital to supplement its own available capital, and look to generate fee-based revenue from managing third-party capital and assets.\n\nAmFraser research analyst Victor Wai said Thakral's investment division was strong, and it can look into a possible spinoff of that.\n\nThakral shares closed unchanged at 2.8 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That means I'll probably go on for a while ... it's not a problem of age, it's all in your mind.\"\n\nIn fact, Salgado's latest exhibition, a show of 245 pictures called Genesis, took him eight years of trekking across the globe in search of untouched natural environments in over 30 countries. Genesis premiered at the Natural History Museum in London last April, and has now made its way to the National Museum of Singapore where it will run from tomorrow till July 27.\n\nAccording to Salgado, the idea for this exhibition came about when he returned to his family's farm in Brazil in 1998, and realised most of the rainforests he grew up with both in and around the farm had been destroyed.\n\nSo, together with his wife, Lelia Deluiz Wanick, who designed and curated Genesis, they embarked on a project to replant these lost trees.\n\n\"Today there are millions of trees planted. And we have the wildlife coming back - jaguars, crocodiles, birds and insects,\" says Salgado, with a satisfied grin. \"That forest gave me the idea to do Genesis; to go see what was not yet destroyed on the planet. And I was surprised to discover that close to half the planet remains yet as the day of genesis,\" he adds.\n\nSome of the photos in this exhibition feature natural landscapes like the Grand Canyon, or icebergs in the Antarctic Peninsula, while others capture wildlife like penguins and elephants, among others.\n\nThrough his pictures, Salgado hopes to give people a sample of the part of nature that is yet untouched, and show that it is worth preserving.\n\nHe explains: \"When we live in big cities like Singapore, Beijing, Rio de Janeiro, we forget nature. We forget that the planet is very nice - it gives us oxygen. But we destroy trees. And if we aren't careful, oxygen will be a problem for us one day. If oxygen is finished, we're finished.\"\n\n\"We need to give back something to the planet, otherwise one day the planet will make us pay the bill,\" he explains.\n\nSalgado took his first photos in 1973, when his wife one day brought home a Pentax camera. Since then, he has built a formidable reputation for himself as a pioneer in black and white film photography.\n\nHe recently made a rather reluctant switch from film to digital while working on Genesis, when airport security X-Rays were proving harmful to his film.\n\nWhile he appreciates the high quality of digital images, and the convenience of 16-gigabyte memory cards over 36-shot film rolls, Salgado still disapproves of the way digital photography has diluted the value of the medium. \"There's a difference between image and photography,\" Salgado insists. \"Photography is the materialisation of the act. You shoot, you print, and you can touch it. But the image is a concept. You cannot touch it. You tap a button and it disappears. So in the future we will still have the image, but photography itself is disappearing,\" he says.\n\nBecause of this, while shooting with a digital SLR for Genesis, he refused to look at what he had shot, until his assistants had converted the digital files into old-fashioned contact sheets and negatives for him to work on.\n\nAnd his resistance is also partly because of his age, he admits. \"I'm an old-fashioned photographer because I'm an old man. I don't know how to use computers,\" Salgado says with a sheepish laugh.\n\nAnd when asked if he has tips from his decades of experience behind the viewfinder, the humble ex-Magnum photographer says techniques are the easy part - all it takes is practice and experimenting and anyone can get it.\n\nBut one advice he does have is this: \"If you want to do the kind of photography I did, go take a class in anthropology, or sociology, or something to understand the society you live in. That way you can link your photography with social movements.\n\n\"It'll be better than having a good camera or be very smart with framing ... because you photograph not with technique. You photograph with your soul, spirit, mind, and ideology. Photography is a materialisation of your dreams.\"\n\nrachloi@sph.com.sg\n\n'Genesis' runs at the National Museum of Singapore Exhibition Gallery 2, Basement, from tomorrow till July 27.

At the Les Amis group, it means that if it is too difficult to hire capable staff from the already dwindling pool of manpower in the food and beverage (F&B) industry, then you just have to groom your own.\n\nGrooming and at the same time offering a helping hand to the less well-off has allowed the restaurant group to build a steady pool of talent, thanks to its emphasis on scholarships and training programmes.\n\nFor the past 10 years, the group - with more than 20 restaurants in its stable - has provided scholarships for students in Temasek Polytechnic's hospitality and tourism management, and culinary and catering management programmes.\n\nMore recently, it extended its scholarships to students from the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) who are interested in a career in the F&B industry, but might not have the financial resources to do so.\n\nLong-term staffer Rachel Aw is one who has benefited from the schemes. The 28-year-old was a Temasek Polytechnic student eight years ago when she was picked for a Les Amis scholarship to pursue her interests in F&B. After graduation, she worked at flagship restaurant Les Amis for five years before she opted to leave to study hotel administration at Cornell University.\n\nThe group not only gave her its blessing, but also co-funded her education at Cornell. \"I wanted to learn more about the business. The scholarships helped me get into one of the best hospitality schools, which I could not have afforded financially,\" she said.\n\nShe is now the assistant general manager of Canele Patisserie, the group's pastry arm.\n\nThe Les Amis group recently turned 25, and to commemorate the occasion, it donated 20 per cent of group-wide revenue on March 15.\n\nAs part of a month-long fund-raising effort, it held a private charity auction dinner to raise more funds for the scholarship.\n\nIt raised $540,000. When the government's dollar-for-dollar matching grant was added, the total reached $1.08 million - to be split equally between Temasek Polytechnic and ITE for their scholarship funds, and allowing the number of scholars to be doubled.\n\nRaymond Lim, director of corporate office, conceded that it is not easy to maintain the scholarship programme. The group still face problems such as keeping the students in the industry after graduation.

Singapore may wish to explore similar legislation or a fair consideration lease framework.\"\n\nThese views were aired at an SBF forum yesterday, where close to 180 corporate leaders from a myriad of industries were polled on various business pressures.\n\nClose to three-quarters (73 per cent) of participants said that they had been affected by rental rates and lease terms negotiations. When asked about measures to best promote the development of SMEs and reduce rental pressures, around 37 per cent opted for fair tenancy legislation, while 35 per cent would like to see a fair consideration lease framework.\n\nTheir sentiments echo a growing number of voices in recent months - both in and out of Parliament - calling for greater government intervention.\n\nAssociation of Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME) president Kurt Wee told The Business Times that over the last 10 years, there had been a shift towards \"a very aggressive\" model where rent is based on a percentage of gross turnover. Said Mr Wee: \"I've come across lease agreements where landlords take as high as 28 per cent of (their tenant's) turnover - that's better than a shareholder, without even investing in the business!\"\n\nLast month, Minister of State for Trade and Industry Teo Ser Luck said that the government will intervene if it sees evidence of collusion or the abuse of market dominance by any landlord - including real estate investment trusts (Reits). He also revealed that the government was looking into publishing more comprehensive shop rental data later this year, to make rental pricing more transparent.\n\nBut Mr Wee feels that the government should go a step further. He said that fair tenancy legislation here should make effective rent reporting mandatory, so as to create an information databank for maximum transparency. He would also like a panel to preside over leasing disputes, and a published set of recommended practices approved by the Competition Commission of Singapore.\n\n\"Don't be mistaken - we're not trying to interfere with the demand and supply situation. We're saying landlords can charge as high (rents) as they want, but we want some kind of fair trading act to bring full transparency to the market . . . We also need to manage unreasonable rent increases,\" said Mr Wee, adding that some SMEs have seen their rents increase by 400 per cent upon renewal.\n\n\"At the end of the day, (legislation would be) good for institutional landlords, because they will end up having more sustainable rental rates (since businesses won't fold as often). We should stop churning asset prices to a level where they're not manageable, where it becomes a bubble.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

At the end of 2013, the value of the company's assets in the United Arab Emirates had fallen to 32 per cent of the total, from 35 per cent a year earlier, according to the company's financial statements.\n\n\"A few years ago, the view was different. Now, I believe there's great potential in Dubai,\" Ibrahim Al Saqabi, Al Mazaya's chief executive officer, said this week in an interview here. \"We'll launch several new projects this year, including some in Dubai.\"\n\nProperty prices in Dubai rose as much as 43 per cent last year, according to Cluttons LLC data on Bloomberg, as the economy rebounded from a credit crunch. The surge enabled Nakheel PJSC to start repaying debt ahead of schedule, and helped Damac Real Estate Development Ltd sell a US$650 million sukuk earlier this month.\n\nDubai's real estate rally has helped lower the borrowing costs of developers including Emaar Properties PJSC and Nakheel. The yield on Emaar's Islamic debt maturing in July 2019 was at 3.77 per cent on Monday compared with 4.54 per cent at the end of last year. The yield on Nakheel's notes due in August 2016 has fallen 122 basis points to 5.41 per cent since the start of the year. The yield on Middle East sukuk have declined 33 basis points on average, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co indexes.\n\n\"Issuing sukuk is an option that we'll be exploring this year,\" said Mr Al Saqabi. \"Availability of liquidity isn't an issue for us. If we do a sukuk, it'll be for the diversification of our funding sources and to put us in contact with new potential investors.\"\n\nAl Mazaya is also launching new projects in Bahrain and Oman this year, and is currently studying the potential to begin its first project in Turkey.\n\nDemand for properties in Dubai is increasingly coming from people who live and work in the emirate rather than financial investors, said Mr Al Saqabi. The emirate had one of the worst real estate crashes during the financial crisis as speculators fled in 2008.\n\n\"The market is much more regulated now, the financing of property is much more regulated and the demand is real,\" said Mr Al Saqabi. Al Mazaya has invested six billion dirhams (S$2 billion) in the Dubai real estate market so far, according to Mr Al Saqabi, who became CEO in April 2013.\n\nDubai has been taking steps to limit the buying and selling of incomplete properties, known as flipping, that was blamed for playing a major part in the 2008 crash. Prices fell by as much as 65 per cent when the emirate's real estate bubble burst. The Land Department raised the transaction fee to 4 per cent from 2 per cent last year, and the United Arab Emirates Central Bank imposed restrictions on the value of mortgages made available to foreign buyers to try and cool the market. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

As at yesterday, a gramme of gold cost about $60, and 10 grammes of silver, $10.\n\nInvestors who invest in gold typically have to fork out at least $100 to buy a 1/20-ounce coin.\n\nSGPMX chief executive Victor Foo said: \"We understand that not all consumers have the liquidity to purchase gold and silver in large quantities in each transaction, and purchasing small quantities continues to remain expensive due to the high premiums.\n\n\"The idea is to allow individuals, regardless of financial standing, to accumulate precious metals in small denominations.\"\n\nCustomers can arrange for a certain amount - enough to pay for at least one gramme of gold or 10 grammes of silver - to be deducted from their bank account by Giro each month to make small incremental purchases.\n\nThe account will be backed by physical bullion, in particular a special CombiBar made by Swiss refiner Valcambi.\n\nThe 50-gramme, credit card-sized bar - dubbed \"chocolate bar\" by some - is pre-cut into one-gramme pieces that can be easily broken off by hand, but investors are required to accumulate up to 50 grammes of gold or 100 grams of silver to be able to collect the bar.\n\nOtherwise, they can sell the holdings in their accounts back to the firm at a discount to the market price, or to other investors on SGPMX's online trading platform, though buyers will have to similarly reach 50 grammes before they can retrieve the gold.\n\nMr Foo added: \"In short, we don't want to break up the bar. We want you to buy the full bar. This is targeted at people who can commit that amount over a period of time.\"\n\nSGPMX claims to run the only online exchange in the world for individuals to buy and sell physical precious metals from one another. Established in August 2011 by Mr Foo, who previously owned financial consulting firm Independent Planners Sdn Bhd in Malaysia, the company makes the selling of physical bullion its core business.\n\nThis has pitched it headlong into competition with UOB, an established player in the local bullion market which launched its gold and silver savings accounts 33 years ago.\n\nIt is the only local bank offering physical gold to retail customers. The bank requires an investor to buy at least five grammes of gold or 10 ounces of silver in each transaction. This would have cost $261 and $249 respectively in yesterday's prices.\n\nAs demand for gold surged last year, following a plunge in gold prices in April, the bank did not remain still on this front. A month after that, it launched online access to these savings accounts, and followed this up in October by enabling access through its mobile application.\n\nBefore this, customers had to visit a UOB branch during banking hours to carry out transactions on the savings accounts.\n\nA spokesman for the bank said: \"Today, digital channels are the main channel for gold purchases by our customers, and together contribute more than 80 per cent of total gold purchased (from the bank).\"\n\nThe number of gold and silver savings accounts opened with the bank grew 20 per cent between 2012 and last year.\n\nThe gold sector here received a fillip in October 2012, with the removal of the Goods and Services Tax for investment-grade precious metals; three banks opened gold vaults in quick succession last year. Small precious metals retailers such as GoldSilver Central and Silver Bullion have also set up shop in the past few years, BT previously reported.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The court clash pits the San Francisco-based technology business that supporters say should be welcomed as a boost for local tourism against housing advocates who argue the service is driving up rents and turning affordable accommodation into illegal hotels.\n\n\"Today, the attorney general made it clear that he remains determined to comb through the personal information of thousands of regular New Yorkers just trying to make ends meet,\" David Hantman, head of global public policy for Airbnb, said in a statement.\n\nThe judge didn't issue a decision on Tuesday, according to the attorney general's office.\n\nAirbnb, which is said to be valued at US$10 billion under a financing deal with TPG Capital, provides a marketplace for short-term rentals of homes throughout the world. It said that it expects to generate US$768 million in economic activity in New York City this year. InterContinental Hotels Group Plc, whose brands include the Holiday Inn, has a market value of US$8.3 billion.\n\nUnder New York law prohibiting illegal hotels, residents may not rent out their entire homes for less than 30 days. More than 60 per cent of New York City Airbnb listings on Jan 31 appeared to violate that law, according to an affidavit filed with the court this week by Sumanta Ray, director of research and analysis for the attorney general's investor protection bureau.\n\nSome hosts offered multiple properties including one entity listing 80, according to the affidavit.\n\n\"Airbnb is simply looking out for its bottom line at the expense of a law that protects quality of life for building residents and safety for tourists,\" Matt Mittenthal, a spokesman for Mr Schneiderman, said on Monday. Airbnb has resorted to \"name calling and public relations to confuse the issue\", he said.\n\nMr Hantman said on the company's website on Monday that the majority of its hosts are \"regular people, renting out their own home to travellers\" and that it wants to be able to collect and remit taxes under the law.\n\nThe dispute between the attorney general and the home-sharing service highlights tensions between existing regulations and growing \"sharing economy\", said Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business who studies how information technologies transform business and society.\n\n\"The new ways of doing things are sort of hitting up against this regulatory infrastructure,\" he said.\n\nThe company's approximately 15,000 New York hosts are probably a \"drop in the ocean\" compared with how many residents might consider using the service to help pay rent if not for regulatory or other concerns, he said.\n\n\"The fact that there is this potential is precisely the reason why the regulatory barriers are so high,\" he said.\n\nThe Washington-based Internet Association, representing e-commerce companies including Amazon.com Inc, EBay Inc and Twitter Inc, called the attorney general's probe \"unwarranted\" and \"unjust\". \"Airbnb generates positive economic returns for cities around the world, adds millions of dollars to local economies, and brings more people to New York,\" Internet Association President and CEO Michael Beckerman said. \"Airbnb should be welcomed by business and government leaders hungry for a boost in local tourism, not pushed out by politicians seeking to protect incumbents and special interests.\"\n\nHousing advocates and tenant groups counter that services such as Airbnb threaten to drive up rents and convert otherwise affordable housing into illegal hotels.\n\n\"New York City's affordable housing crisis has reached epic proportions and websites like Airbnb have only exacerbated the problem,\" Jonathan Westin, executive director of New York Communities for Change, said in an e-mailed statement.\n\nFounded in 2008, Airbnb is backed by venture-capital firms including Sequoia Capital, Greylock Partners and Founders Fund.\n\nAt US$10 billion, Airbnb joins the ranks of the most highly valued private US technology companies, which include Dropbox Inc and Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nIf TPG is moving ahead with financing for the company amid the legal case, \"then they must have a very low level of concern that this is going to be meaningful\" by having an impact on cash flow, Scott F Meadow, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said in a phone interview.\n\n\"If the answer to that is it's going to have even a 10 per cent probability of influencing cash flow, I think most buyout firms of this quality would think twice before they go forward,\" he said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

The portion on macro hedging was spun off as a separate project because of its complexity and so as to \"elicit views from a broader range of constituents\".\n\nYesterday, Singapore's Accounting Standards Council (ASC) said that it would be accepting comments on these proposals. The public has until Sept 5 to submit its comments to the ASC.\n\nCurrently, many financial institutions manage risks, such as interest rate risk, dynamically on a portfolio basis rather than on an individual contract basis. Dynamic risk management, or macro hedging, is a continuous process because the risks that such entities face evolve over time - that is, new risks are added, while others may fade - as does their approach to managing those risks.\n\nThe problem is that the current accounting requirements of IAS 39 require entities to account for risks on an individual contract basis - which is difficult to apply when accounting for such transactions.\n\n\"Current requirements make it difficult to faithfully represent dynamic risk management in entities' financial statements and can increase operational complexity,\" said IASB chairman Hans Hoogervorst.\n\nThe changes, proposed by the IASB in a consultation paper, Accounting for Dynamic Risk Management: a Portfolio Revaluation Approach to Macro Hedging, aims to address these concerns by prescribing a portfolio revaluation approach instead.\n\nUnder this approach, exposures that are risk-managed dynamically would be revalued for changes in the managed risk through profit or loss. Fair value changes arising from risk management instruments, or derivatives, that are used to manage this risk would also be recognised in profit or loss.\n\nFair valuation of the risk exposures that are dynamically managed will not be required.\n\nMr Hoogervorst said that this set of proposals \"better reflects the economics of dynamic risk management as compared to the current accounting requirements\".\n\n\"Users of financial statements will also benefit from presentation that shows how dynamic risk management has affected an entity's profit or loss,\" he added.\n\nAndrew Spooner, financial instruments lead partner at Deloitte, said that the proposals would fundamentally change banks' accounting for lending and deposits. \"The discussion paper purposely asks more questions than the IASB has answers for. It is the start of what will be a long journey to solve the ongoing debate as to how to best account for banks' macro hedging of interest rates.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Do you know what your mother's childhood was like? Or what problems your colleagues face at home every day?\n\nFor most people, there are many excuses to not know the answers to these questions: a hectic lifestyle, an awkward conversation, or our favourite Singaporean saying - it's simply none of our business.\n\nBut all these excuses were tossed out the window when local theatre actress Oon Shu An had to personally interview the people in her life - ex-teachers, colleagues, old friends and ex-boyfriends - all in the name of research for her debut as a playwright for Checkpoint Theatre's latest production, #UnicornMoment.\n\nNo matter who she was talking to, her interviews covered similar questions like \"are you happy?\", and \"what do you think of me?\"\n\n\"Some of the questions were really scary to ask,\" admits Oon, 27. \"Like what someone thought of me, or if they regret how their life turned out. But along the way I found out some interesting things about people that I never would have known otherwise.\"\n\nFor example, she found out that a friend was once in an abusive relationship, while another had contemplated suicide.\n\n\"Everybody's story was so diverse, and there's a lot of pain that many of us hide because we're in a society where ugly emotions like anger or jealousy make you an ugly person,\" she explains.\n\nSo using everything she learnt in the interviews, Oon has written a one-woman show that she will also be acting in, under the direction of Checkpoint's Huzir Sulaiman and Shiv Tandan.\n\nThe play's run will be preceded by eight weekly video podcasts where Oon discusses personal yet pertinent social issues such as the link between beauty and self-esteem, and the effects of the education system.\n\nAnd though the script is written by her, performed by her, and based on her own life experiences, Oon reassures audiences that the play will not entirely be about her.\n\n\"If someone else had to write it and I acted in it, it's the same. It would just be a story about somebody else, which is what a lot of plays are about. And a lot of issues we all face are universal, so I'm just playing a character trying to figure out universal issues,\" she says.\n\nAlso elaborating on that point, Huzir says: \"I think people write about their lives because on some level they hope someone else feels the same way. #UnicornMoment is about that empathy. We may hear Shu An's stories and experience life through her eyes, but what #UnicornMoment really speaks of, and to, is your life.\"\n\n'#UnicornMoment' runs at the Esplanade Theatre Studio from May 8 to 10 at 8pm, with an additional 3pm show on Sat.

Still, raising money via social media has yet to really take off here - but that may well change as a growing number of platform providers enter the scene to help local startups link up with potential investors and craft their crowdfunding campaigns. BT Lifestyle talks to five such providers\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Apr 24, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTurning ideas into viable businesses\n\nCROWDONOMIC\n\nwww.crowdonomic.com\n\nWHEN Reona Shimada first started Crowdonomic with co-founder Nicola Castelnuovo in January last year, crowdfunding was still in its infancy.\n\nSmall, independent startups or entrepreneurs were using the platform to showcase their ideas, hoping to draw enough eyeballs from individual Internet users that would eventually translate into donations for their startup capital.\n\nBut since then, the industry has seen a fast-growing trend of large corporations with deep pockets turning their attention towards crowdfunding as a source of innovation, observes Mr Shimada, a 38-year-old Singapore PR who was born in Japan.\n\nHe explains: \"The traditional road map was for big corporates to do R&D, but now you can parallel track that. You can have ideas in the lab, test it in a crowdfunding campaign, and see the response, instead of researching for two years and launching the product into the market before realising it's something the market doesn't want.\"\n\nSet to be a pioneer in this trend is Crowdtivate - a crowdfunding website co-managed by Crowdonomic and telecommunications company StarHub, which will be fully operational next month.\n\nEntrepreneurs who post the most innovative campaigns and receive the most public support on the website will eventually receive not just financial support from the telco, but also mentorship and access to their technology and infrastructure.\n\nWhen asked why they would look to the crowdfunding space for innovation, StarHub's head of i3 (Innovation, Investment, Incubation), Stephen Lee, explains that they see a potentially continuous source of ideas in the public, the best of which they can later incorporate into their own organisation.\n\nHe explains: \"We wanted to create a platform that will curate the best ideas in Asia and for the general public to express their support for the ones that really stand out. We also believe this approach offers (campaign) owners a more comprehensive road map to turn their ideas into a viable business outside of just pure funding.\"\n\nBeyond their plans with StarHub, Mr Shimada also intends to adapt Crowdonomic's business model to work with other corporations to launch more websites such as Crowdtivate.\n\n\"I want people to one day think about financing and have a choice between venture capital, a bank, or crowdfunding, then opt for crowdfunding because of its multi-benefits.\n\nA lot of corporations now have a venture capital arm, but maybe in the future as an alternative or parallel they will have a crowdfunding arm,\" says Mr Shimada.\n\nBy RACHEL LOI\n\nrachloi@sph.com.sg\n\nPozible offers bridge between Asia, West\n\nPOZIBLE\n\nPozible.com\n\nAUSTRALIAN crowdfunding company Pozible entered Singapore and Malaysia three months ago and already the first wave of successful projects are coming out of Singapore.\n\nOne success story, for example, is bag designer Gnome & Bow, which raised over S$37,000 in under 40 days.\n\n\"For many entrepreneurs of varying levels of ambition, we are one of the few global platforms which are officially available here and with local support,\" says Adrianna Tan, Pozible's marketing manager, South-east Asia. \"We take our Asian growth seriously and we can see many opportunities for our platform to offer a bridge between Asia and the West.\"\n\nShe notes how in Asia, the crowdfunding project types range from music and theatre to community causes and animal welfare.\n\n\"People here may not necessarily want or need to use the funds to set up a brand new business or entrepreneurship opportunity, but they find it's a great way to just start up something they are passionate about.\"\n\nShe adds: \"It's true that crowdfunding is more difficult than it looks - but it's not difficult so to speak. Think of it as a different form of marketing. Many people, unless they are veteran marketers and communicators, find it hard to distil the essence of what they are trying to do into a video and a short pitch. It's a great idea in their heads - but they need to learn to tell people about it.\"\n\nTraditional forms of marketing require different skill sets but crowdfunding, being newer, will take some time to become familiar territory.\n\nMs Tan says that Pozible already provides the most extensive project support out of all the global platforms. \"We run workshops frequently - with schools, organisations, even informal groups - and we teach them how to start a project,\" says Ms Tan. \"From figuring out their project description to offering them support with social media. Even though people in this part of the world are savvy about social media, using social media for marketing is a different ball game altogether.\"\n\nUltimately, it's the community - not the platform - that matters, Ms Tan notes. Pozible offers rewards-based crowdfunding which is suitable to most types of projects.\n\nFor a project like Gnome & Bow, before crowdfunding made it possible to pre-sell a product, someone like Quanda Ong would have to borrow that seed money from family, investors or a bank in order to start a production run - the latter two usually with some equity or royalty in return. \"But because he managed to get more than 200 people around the world to buy his products - the entire process is much shorter and more efficient too.\"\n\nGnome & Bow has become the biggest fashion crowdfunding project ever run on Pozible, but just on Tuesday, Ms Tan points out how a Chinese project launch had achieved its funding target in just one minute. \"This Chinese project, Gyenno One wristbands, had already sold out of its first category of rewards and achieved 3,200 per cent of its target, within six hours.\"\n\nAll of which points to the huge potential of crowdfunding in Asia.\n\nBy CHEAH UI-HOON\n\nuihoon@sph.com.sg\n\nMaking it and at the right price\n\nHAYSTAKT PROJECTS\n\nwww.haystakt.com\n\nINDEPENDENT craft makers often find themselves asking two big questions: How much to produce, and how to price it? Produce too much and you risk wastage if the product doesn't sell. Make too little and you might not meet demand. The same goes for pricing - priced too high and no one will buy. Priced too low, and it becomes a loss-making business.\n\nHaystakt.com, the online platform for independent producers to sell their craftwork aims to provide the solution to the two questions. It recently launched Projects, believed to be the first ever online crowd-pricing platform.\n\nHere's how it works: The craftsman lists his project on the website, for a fixed period of time, say 30 days. He also sets the minimum price and the number of pieces he hopes there will be orders for by the end of that 30 days. An interested buyer comes to the site, and if he agrees to the current price, places an order for the product. The higher the number of orders placed, the cheaper the price of the product becomes.\n\nOnce the order period is over, the final price for each buyer is calculated and charged - the maker can then commence production knowing exactly how many pieces to manufacture. After that is done, the craftsman will ship the product to each buyer. If a project does not reach its minimum order goal by the end of its duration, no one is charged, and the maker does not proceed with production.\n\nWith Projects, a maker will know exactly how much to produce and can leverage economies of scale to bring about a lower price for customers, without having to reduce his profit margin. In other words, the product is produced at a demand-driven price acceptable to both the maker and his buyers. Haystakt's founder Joel Leong says, \"we found that smaller producers often struggled with pricing and quantity decisions,\" hence the need to start Projects. \"We knew there had to be a better way to help craftsmen produce at scale. So why not take the decisions of pricing and production into the hands of purchasers themselves?\"\n\nTo date, four products have been listed on Projects - they include a spinning top paperweight, a tote bag made from parasol off-cuts, ceramic tea cups and a DIY wallet kit. Projects targets product designers who would benefit from producing at scale, and want to get a good gauge of price setting and production demand.\n\nBy TAY SUAN CHIANG\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\n@TaySuanChiangBT\n\nHelping startups to do more\n\nAVVIO/KENNEL/SMART SPACE\n\nwww.avvio.me\n\n,\n\ninthekennel.com\n\n,\n\nwww.smartspace.sg\n\nTHREE companies are collaborating to accelerate the local crowdfunding scene - by helping companies shape their brands and craft their products to market, linking them with private and crowdfunding sources. The local outfit is out to make crowdfunding more accessible for startups, and not just supporters.\n\nSays Charles Koh, founder of local crowdfunding platform Avvio: \"Whether it's brainstorming creative perks to entice supporters, writing press releases or helping them put together a video, we want to give every project the best chance of making it.\"\n\nAvvio, Kennel and Smart Space are also working to connect starters with other people in their respective networks who can help them.\n\n\"The biggest misconception about crowdfunding is that the platform will find supporters for you. It's common for people to post a project up and then do nothing about it short of maybe sharing on Facebook,\" he points out.\n\nCrowdfunding doesn't work that way, and that's probably why more than half of crowdfunding projects fail, even on established platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo.\n\n\"With Avvio, we've found that the projects that succeed are those where starters are most focused - by sending out personal e-mails, press releases and really working social media. Our third project, Jonathan Meur's debut album, recently raised $3,615 out of its target of $3,500, which might not sound like a lot until you consider that most people were only giving small sums of $12-25 each. Jon worked incredibly hard to connect with his fans and their friends, and we were so happy when his efforts paid off with 73 individual pledges for his project.\"\n\nMr Koh sees plenty of encouraging signs for crowdfunding to take off here. A children's charity book project on Avvio recently raised over $30,000.\n\n\"Most of the highly successful Singapore projects you see are charity or social cause-oriented, which is great, but the projects that have so far made crowdfunding such a hit in the US and won mass appeal and media attention tend to be creative or technology focused, like the Veronica Mars movie or the Ouya gaming console.\"\n\nTech and creative ideas in Singapore have yet to utilise crowdfunding in a big way, but Avvio and Kennel hope to change this. \"Some day soon, we hope to have Singapore's version of the Veronica Mars project,\" he adds.\n\nIs Avvio a David though, compared to the Goliaths in the crowdfunding industry? Says Mr Koh: \"While we understand bigger companies have more of a presence, the platform itself doesn't actually make much of a difference to individual projects. The vast majority of support for a project will come from the promotion a starter does, not random people who just happen to be browsing.\"\n\nThe type of platform doesn't matter so much as the type of project and how much work the starter is willing to put in, he stresses.\n\nThe group is offering personalised advice and help to starters such as discussing rewards and even filming and editing videos for starters.\n\n\"With twentyfifteen, the project currently running on the site, we worked with them to think up useful ways for them to use crowdfunding, as they initially had no clear idea what they wanted to do. We also worked with them on their video and rewards,\" adds Mr Koh.\n\nOther projects in the pipeline include a World Oceans Month project in June, and promotion for an upcoming film starring The Noose character Lulu, by well-known actress/director Michelle Chong and her company Huat Films.\n\nBy CHEAH UI-HOON\n\nuihoon@sph.com.sg\n\nEmpowering women to start up\n\nWOOMENTUM\n\nwww.woomentum.com\n\n(coming soon)\n\nFb:\n\nfacebook.com/woomentum\n\nDO you believe in women power? More than 80 women who gathered at The Hub on Somerset Road on Tuesday night certainly did - with many of them pledging on site to projects created by women entrepreneurs. It was one of the first live crowdfunding audiences in Singapore, says Woomentum founder Mouna Aouri.\n\n\"We'd sourced four women entrepreneurs and coached them so they could pitch their business in the most professional way. We raised $3,000 that evening, which doesn't sound like a huge amount but it's a big deal because the audience had never done it before - pledge money to a proposed project, live.\"\n\nIt's Woomentum's first project in its bid to build a platform around women entrepreneurs, says the 39-year-old Tunisian civil engineer-turned-entrepreneur. \"The idea is to provide them with the expertise and funding they need. Also, Woomentum will focus on partnering with other existing platforms like Pozible and Crowdonomics to put the spotlight on female-run campaigns, and also to bring these projects to fruition,\" she explains.\n\nMs Aouri sees her role as helping to curate existing campaigns and also to help new entrepreneurs prepare their campaign, she says. Ms Aouri moved to Singapore in 2011, and is also a mother of two young children - which led the master's graduate to the idea of helping other women get going with their ideas, as she realised how they needed an extra push, especially when returning to work after child rearing.\n\n\"Think of Woomentum as a movement,\" she adds. \"It's not just a networking or an online platform, but really an overlap of both. It listens to the community and lets it lead the way the movement goes. It's about human-to-human relationships.\"\n\nWoomentum will work with women in the initial stages of their idea and move it forward - by bringing them opportunities - so it's easier to start up.\n\nCrowdfunding and related concepts such as crowdsourcing are really going to shape the way business is done in the future, believes Ms Aouri.\n\n\"It's touching everything now from education and healthcare to science. It's not just about sourcing money, but changing the way we relate to products and projects.\"\n\nIncreasingly, people buy into something because they believe there's something more behind the product.\n\n\"Which means that a successful campaign is when you move emotions and intellect - that they believe it's worth putting money in. It's about engaging the consumer and in a responsible way,\" says Ms Aouri.\n\nMs Aouri will be looking outside of Singapore after a year as she wants to extend her model throughout the region. \"It is an online platform after all, and there are no boundaries.\"\n\nBy CHEAH UI-HOON\n\nuihoon@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/keep-closer-eye-late-large-cap-trades", "site_title": "Keep closer eye on late large cap trades", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nKeep closer eye on late large cap trades\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Apr 23, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nAT the end of last week, the Straits Times Index closed at its highest in eight months, up 2.7 per cent for the year to date. It would be tempting to conclude from this that most stocks had gained, on average, 2.7 per cent or thereabouts for 2014. Unfortunately, this was not the case - 47 per cent of the market or about half of all stocks was still in negative territory.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, 12 of the 30 STI components were also in the red for the year, including market mainstays such as DBS, OCBC, SembCorp Industries, SembCorp Marine, Keppel Corp and perhaps the best proxy for the local market, the Singapore Exchange.\n\nA look at the index's best performers shows that its gain was largely due to Olam International and the Jardine group - Olam is up a whopping 45 per cent since the start of the year because of Temasek's takeover bid and the Jardine group's gains ranged from 12 per cent for Jardine Strategic to 34 per cent for Jardine Cycle & Carriage. With Jardine's large market cap, its influence on the index is typically substantial.\n\nIt would therefore not be accurate to say that the local market was at an eight-month high, or even that the market was in positive territory for the year. The index yes, the market no.\n\nThis in turn raises two interesting issues. First, is there a need to rethink the way the market is represented? Second, if movements in only a few counters can skew the index, then manipulation becomes a problem.\n\nTrying to represent the entire market with one benchmark is a challenge which specialists have grappled with for decades and it's important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all, perfect answer. Some indices are price-weighted, others market-cap weighted, some include only a few big stocks, others try to include all.\n\nThere has also been some progress into research into risk-weighted indices instead of the traditional price or market-weights. Despite possessing academic and even some practical appeal, such indices however, have not taken off yet, possibly because it is difficult for many to accept a drastic change to accepted practices.\n\nAll specialists acknowledge that the best conceived and constructed indices may not truly represent the market at any one point in time and worse, can be susceptible to rigging.\n\nSpeaking of rigging, the topic received a prominent airing in the Australian media last week when a report in the Sydney Morning Herald said that manipulation is rife on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). It quoted researchers who found that there are frequently dramatic price spikes in key stocks just before the market closes at 4pm, spikes that occur more often than not on the last day of significant trading periods, for example the end of each month, quarter and financial year.\n\nThe study also found that rogue fund managers Down Under typically time their purchases for the very last minute so as to create the impression of demand and thereby drive more demand.\n\nThe motive for rigging prices or \"window-dressing\" the indices on such specific days is - at the risk of stating the obvious - money, more money than is probably deserved since indices are used as benchmarks for various performance-related exercises - company valuations, executive compensation, fund manager remuneration and so forth.\n\nUntil such time as specialists agree on a better means of devising market benchmarks, last-minute \"window-dressing\" will always be present. What the market then needs is stronger regulatory action and deterrence to minimise such distortions which, when you think about it, amount to the creation of a false market.\n\nThe Australian regulator ASIC last year invested A$44 million (S$51.3 million) in a new surveillance system built by a company that designs trading software for algorithmic and high-frequency traders, and allows the ASIC to comb through thousands of trades in less than a second to identify insider trading and market manipulation much faster than before.\n\n(Interestingly, A$33 million of the system's cost will be recovered from brokers and market operators, many of whom already resent having to reimburse the non-profit ASIC for its surveillance costs that are higher than those incurred by previous regulator ASX. Even ASX's rival exchange Chi-X has had to contribute. Would such a cost recovery arrangement find favour here?)\n\nHere, there should be increased scrutiny of trades in the big cap index stocks on the last day or last few days of significant reporting periods. Particular attention should be paid to big movements that occur in low volume and there should ideally be tracking of who the buyers and sellers are.\n\nEven though the STI may not truly represent the market at any one time, its movements exert considerable influence on sentiment.

A breakthrough in Tokyo would facilitate a breakthrough in Singapore, sources suggested.\n\nMr Obama's trip to Tokyo and the second leg of his Asia tour, to Seoul, come after he brokered a meeting between Mr Abe and South Korean President Park Geun Hye in The Hague last month, and the US president will try to cement closer ties with Mr Abe and Ms Park building on the outcome of their trilateral summit, Kyodo said.\n\nAfter moving to Seoul tomorrow, Mr Obama will discuss with President Park their efforts \"to stand up to the provocative acts from the North Koreans\" and the implementation of a bilateral free trade pact, Mr Rhodes was reported by Kyodo as saying.\n\nNorth Korea recently fired hundreds of artillery shells near the de facto sea border with South Korea in the Yellow Sea. As some of the shells flew beyond the border, South Korea responded, Kyodo said\n\nPyongyang has also threatened to conduct a \"new form\" of nuclear test and launched rockets and missiles, including ballistic ones, into the Sea of Japan, the agency noted.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Net profit margin slipped 5.5 percentage points to 45.8 per cent.\n\nThe company will declare an interim dividend of four cents per share for the quarter, in line with its year-ago payout.\n\nThe weak third quarter caused nine-month earnings to fall 2.1 per cent to $243 million, or 22.72 cents per share.\n\nThe securities market segment was particularly hit. Operating profit from the securities market segment fell 32.7 per cent to $53.1 million as daily average trading value during the quarter fell 27.7 per cent.\n\nThe derivatives market segment slowed 4.9 per cent in terms of operating profit, largely as a result of weaker interest in the Nikkei 225 futures contract, which saw exceptional growth a year ago amid optimism about the Japanese economy.\n\nMr Bocker said the slowdown in securities reflected thinner activity among retail investors despite a growth in the number of retail participants in the market.\n\nImproving liquidity and market quality has therefore been a core focus for SGX, which over the past quarter introduced a raft of changes, including reduced fees and incentives for market makers and liquidity providers.\n\nMr Bocker, however, cautioned against too much optimism about the immediate impact of market makers that SGX hopes to sign on to the market from June.\n\n\"We should all be cognizant of the fact that it will take time to build this market,\" he said.\n\nMr Bocker sought to frame the past two quarters as a cyclical downturn, saying that \"we are confident that our securities market will recover over time\".\n\nThe initial public offering pipeline is stronger than the previous quarter, and remains \"very robust\", Mr Bocker said.\n\nThe growth in the number of retail participants is also encouraging.\n\nOn the derivatives side, SGX plans to introduce new China products, including yuan futures, soon, Mr Bocker said.\n\nSGX shares closed at $6.94 yesterday before the results were announced, down 0.6 per cent or four cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The government and airline deny they are hiding anything. The Boeing 777 went missing on March 8 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people aboard.\n\nMalaysia says satellite data indicates the plane crashed in the remote Indian Ocean but no proof has been found despite an intensive multi-nation sea search. Demanding hard evidence, some vocal relatives have repeatedly said they were unconvinced by Malaysia's conclusions on the data analysis, performed by British satellite communications firm Inmarsat.\n\n\"They have failed to share why they would accept a single source (Inmarsat) for analysis utilising a never before attempted method, as their sole grounds for determining that the plane is under the water and all lives lost,\" the families said.\n\nThe statement said they requested an independent peer review, but the suggestion was rejected on grounds that Inmarsat's data was under privacy protections. In the Sunday meeting, \"not a single one of our questions was answered\", it added. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Most of the victims were high school children, who were told to stay where they were for their own safety and were trapped.\n\n\"We are trained for hostile environments, but it's hard to be brave when we meet bodies in dark water,\" diver Hwang Dae-sik told Reuters, as the funerals of 25 students were held near the capital, Seoul.\n\nProsecutors investigating the disaster said they raided the home of Yoo Byung-un, head of a family that owns the Chonghaejin Marine Co Ltd, the company that operated the Sewol ferry. They also raided his son's home and the office of a church with which Yoo is associated, said a prosecutor who did not want to be identified.\n\nThe finances of Chonghaejin and its complex share structure have come into the spotlight in recent days. Yoo was jailed for fraud for four years in the early 1990s.\n\nUnderwater, at the site of the sunken Sewol, divers can work for nearly an hour at a time as long as the oxygen lines do not snag on sharp corners of the ship's internal structure. When they use cumbersome oxygen tanks on their backs instead, they can work for about 20 minutes before an alarm bell sounds.\n\nThe Sewol sank last Wednesday on a routine trip from the port of Incheon, near Seoul, to the southern island of Jeju.\n\nOf the 476 passengers and crew on board, 339 were children and teachers on a high school outing. Only 174 people have been rescued and the remainder are presumed to have drowned.\n\nThe confirmed death toll yesterday was 146, many found at the back of the ship on the fourth deck.\n\nMr Hwang said his team had retrieved 14 bodies so far. \"We have to touch everything with our hands. This is the most gruelling and heartbreaking job of my career,\" he said.\n\nFerry captain Lee Joon- seok, 69, and other crew members have been arrested on negligence charges.

We want to say to our friends in Malaysia and China this is not about cost, we are concerned to be seen to be helping them in a most tragic circumstance.\"\n\nChina, whose citizens made up two-thirds of the passengers onboard the ill-fated flight, and Malaysia are among eight countries including Australia which have committed assets to the Indian Ocean search.\n\nBut with no confirmed sightings of debris from the flight on the surface so far, the search moved underwater nearly two weeks ago and is yet to find any sign of the aircraft.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Canberra, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said that searchers still believed the plane crashed in the Indian Ocean. \"Our expert advice is that the aircraft went down somewhere in the Indian Ocean where they have identified a probable impact zone which is about 700 km long, about 80 km wide,\" he said.\n\nMr Abbott said that based on the detections from what Australia still believed was the black box recorder, an underwater search area of just under 400 sq km was being scoured.\n\n\"We haven't finished the search, we haven't found anything yet in the area that we're searching, but the point I make is that Australia will not rest until we have done everything we humanly can to get to the bottom of this mystery,\" he said.\n\nAustralia's Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) said that the device looking for the plane on the seabed had scanned more than 80 per cent of its target zone and was now on its 10th dive. \"No contacts of interest have been found to date,\" it said.\n\nThe torpedo-shaped autonomous underwater vehicle called a Bluefin-21 is searching an area at least 4,500 metres deep defined by a 10 km radius around a detection of a signal believed to be from the plane's black box heard on April 8.\n\nA surface search involving up to 10 military aircraft and 12 ships was also scheduled for yesterday, despite suggestions last week that this effort would be scaled down in coming days.\n\nJACC later suspended the air search activities due to bad weather, which had resulted in heavy seas and poor visibility, but said that the ships would continue their work.\n\nThe visual hunt covers an area totalling about 37,948 sq km, some 855 km northwest of Perth, JACC said.\n\nMr Johnston said that Australia was tracking the cost of the mission, and if the Bluefin-21 failed to spot wreckage, the search would move into a new phase, but said that Canberra was committed to the task.\n\n\"We move to the next phase which is a more intensive single sideband sonar type programme, I suspect, but let's take advice of the experts as to where we go forward,\" he said.\n\nMr Johnston said that Australia was talking with its partners about the assets needed for the next phase of the search for the plane which mysteriously diverted en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.\n\nMr Abbott said that Australia would not abandon the search and let down the families of the six Australians and 233 other people onboard \"by likely surrendering while there is reasonable hope of finding something\".\n\n\"At the moment we are conducting an underwater search with the best equipment that is currently available,\" he said.\n\n\"If at the end of that period, we find nothing, we are not going to abandon the search.

Tenants pay a small percentage of their monthly gross turnover to the Reit.\n\nIn reply to a question on what will become of the 20,000 sq ft of space after Japanese lifestyle store Francfranc vacates its flagship VivoCity outlet on June 1, the chief executive of the trust manager, Amy Ng, said they are working on finding the best possible outcome for the space - be it letting it out whole or sub-dividing it.\n\nMCT owns real estate used primarily for office and retail purposes.\n\nThe Reit noted that while there was an increase in contribution from the office segment, retail remains the larger contributor, contributing 67.8 per to its gross revenue and 65.6 per cent to its net property income in the year.\n\nMs Ng also noted that after stripping out tenant changes, only one trade sector experienced a decline in sales: luxury watches. Every other sector grew, even if just marginally.\n\nThe Reit enjoyed a revaluation gain of $200.7 million on its portfolio as at March 31, 2014, based on independent valuations by CBRE and Knight Frank.\n\nThis brings the valuation of its assets to $4.03 billion as at March 31, 2014, 5.3 per cent higher than a year ago, thanks to strong operating performances at VivoCity and PSA Building.\n\nUnits of the Reit ended unchanged at $1.255 on the stockmarket yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Domestic media said that the abducted men were Indonesians.\n\nThe Japanese tanker, headed for Myanmar from Singapore, had Indonesian, Thai, Myanmar and Indian crew members.\n\nRegional security officials have previously told Reuters that armed gangs prowling the Malacca Strait may be part of a syndicate that can either have links to the crew on board the hijacking target or inside knowledge about the ship and cargo.\n\nSuch intelligence-led hijacks have involved seizing tankers so that petrol cargoes can be transferred and sold on the black market, the officials, who declined to be identified because they are not authorised to speak to the media, have said.\n\nAttacks by gangs armed with guns and knives on shipping in the Malacca Strait have ranged from 12 to 20 incidents a year over the last three years, says the Singapore headquarters of the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP).\n\nMost of these incidents have involved the theft of ship's stores, cash and assaults on the crew.\n\nThat compares with a peak of 220 recorded attacks in 2000, according to the Kuala Lumpur-based International Maritime Bureau, which tracks pirate activity. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Of these, 453 units or 51 per cent were for units of up to 800 sq ft, up from a 44 per cent share for the whole of last year. The proportion has been climbing steadily in recent years, from 25 per cent in 2010 to 32 per cent in 2011 and 36 per cent in 2012.\n\nDTZ's South-east Asia chief operating officer Ong Choon Fah said: \"Those with HDB addresses could be buying a higher proportion of smaller units as the investment sum is much smaller; it comes down to affordability and managing risks. Morever, if they buy from developers, they enjoy progressive payment terms i.e. they pay for the purchase price according to the phases of the project's physical completion. If they are buying for investment, they are unlikely to want to sell until after the project has been completed - as typically, you see a price spike just before a project receives Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP). Every little bit helps.\"\n\nIn contrast, only about 29 per cent of the 1,014 non-landed private homes bought by those with private addresses in Q1 this year were for units up to 800 sq ft. The bulk of their purchases, 59 per cent, involved units larger than 1,000 sq ft, up from a 54 per cent share for the whole of last year.\n\nDTZ said the increase in the proportion of purchases of non-landed private homes up to 800 sq ft by buyers with HDB addresses is probably due to them being more active in the primary or developer sales market. In Q1 2014, about 65 per cent or 581 of the total 892 non-landed private homes (of all sizes) bought by those with HDB addresses were purchased in the primary market, that is, from developers.\n\nLee Lay Keng, regional head (SEA), research at DTZ, noted that developers have continued to mint a higher proportion of smaller units in new projects to keep overall price quantum affordable for buyers, in view of the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework and earlier cooling measures.\n\n\"For those planning to invest, picking up a residential property from a developer at a new launch means that they enjoy the progressive payment scheme and yet can sell off the unit on receipt of TOP four years later, to avoid paying the seller's stamp duty,\" she added.\n\nPut another way, of the total of 750 units of up to 800 sq ft transacted in Q1 2014, 453 units or 60 per cent were acquired by those living in HDB flats and 40 per cent by those with private addresses. It was the reverse situation for bigger units (above 1,000 sq ft). Buyers with private addresses mopped up 66 per cent of the 911 units in this size category that were sold in Q1, with purchasers with HDB addresses picking up the balance 34 per cent.\n\nMarket watchers expect small private apartments/condos to continue to be highly sought after by HDB dwellers and likewise expect developers to continue building a high proportion of such units to cater to buyers sensitive about lump-sum pricing.\n\n\"At most new launches these days, typically the smaller units - the one and two-bedders - sell the fastest,\" observed Mrs Ong.\n\nChesterton Singapore managing director Donald Han estimates that about two-thirds of HDB upgraders would be living in three or four-room HDB flats and their preferred investment in the private segment would be units less than 800 sq ft, that is, one or two-bedders - in line with their affordablility.\n\n\"Some may be buying private homes for owner occupation while keeping their HDB flats to lease out as a longer-term investment, given that net rental yields are higher for HDB flats at about 4 to 5 per cent compared to 3 to 4 per cent for private apartments.\n\n\"However, things may start to change this year if the deceleration in HDB resale prices gathers momentum. Then two things could happen. First, the wealth effect will start to diminish and some HDB dwellers may no longer wish to upgrade.

CapitaLand, for instance, pared down the per square foot (psf) pricing for its Bishan project Sky Habitat by 10 to 15 per cent in its re-launch on April 19.\n\nIn the survey, some 67.7 per cent of respondents said that they expect market sentiment to be hit by rising construction costs, inflation and interest rates in the next six months.\n\nThey also expressed concern about the number of new launches, the tightening of financing and a slowdown in the global economy.\n\nBut seven in 10 respondents said that they do not expect the government to lift or tweak current cooling measures.\n\nMore than half the developers surveyed said that they expect the number of new property launches to either hold steady or go up in the next six months, and residential prices to correct further.\n\nSome 68.4 per cent of the respondents polled in the first quarter said that they foresee a moderate decrease in residential property prices in the next six months, up from 62 per cent in the fourth quarter.\n\nDespite the popularity of the 60-year leasehold Hillford, which was marketed as a retirement-resort development, 63.5 per cent of the respondents said that they would not like to see more 60-year leasehold land being released for private residential projects.\n\nThe high pricing on the per square foot (psf) basis for 60-year leasehold projects may not be sustainable in the market, some said; indicative prices for the 281-unit Hillford in Jalan Jurong Kechil started at around $980 psf, but it was nonetheless sold out on the day sales began in January.\n\nA survey respondent said: \"If 60-year lease tenures become the new normal, there will be a premium attached to 99-year leases. This may have the unintended consequence of a spike in premiums for such developments.\"\n\nSentiment among developers was weakest for the prime residential segment, with more developers expressing pessimism than optimism. However, the number of developers bullish on the office segment outnumbered those with a dimmer outlook.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A COE in Category C - for goods vehicles - plunged $16,613 or a hefty 33.6 per cent to $32,890.\n\nAlso lower was the Cat A premium for cars below 1,600cc and 130 hp: It fell $6,065 to $71,335. Cat B - for cars above 1,600cc or 130 hp - shed a more substantial $9,494 to $75,010, while Cat E - the open category which currently tracks Cat B - dropped $10,290 to $73,810.\n\nOnly Cat D - for motorcycles - inched up $13 to a record $4,502 as dealers rushed to clear stocks ahead of October's new Euro 3 emission standard.\n\n\"I knew premiums would adjust downwards but I didn't expect them to drop by this much,\" said the sales manager of a luxury dealership.\n\nCommercial vehicle COE premiums have also softened because of the enhanced incentives to owners of old diesel commercial vehicles under the Early Turnover Scheme. This has also caused dealers to run out of stock and together with the prospect of a 46.9 per cent jump in Cat C COEs to 770 monthly, the premium's slide was accelerated.\n\nOverall, the new COE quota from May-July 2014 will have 32.1 per cent more COEs than the February-April 2014 quota. Specifically, there will be 41 per cent more Cat A COEs or 1,011 each month, 37.8 per cent more Cat B COEs or 966 monthly, and 53.4 per cent Cat E COEs or 586 monthly.\n\nAs a result, many prospective buyers have been holding back on their purchases.\n\n\"Everyone is waiting for the new quota to kick in,\" said the managing director of a luxury dealership. \"Very few want to commit now, and those who do commit will only do so at a lower price.\"\n\nHe added that a \"lower price\" also means that distributors have to bid less for a COE in future.\n\nOver the past two weeks, several luxury dealers have been cutting prices and increasing COE rebates - some to as high as $80,000 - to woo customers.\n\nMany of the Japanese volume distributors have also dropped prices. This will lead to lower COE bids in future, noted the managing director.\n\n\"I believe prices will continue to slide because it will be self-fulfilling prophecy,\" he said.\n\nBut the head of a rival luxury dealership disagrees and expects the dip in the big car COE premium to be temporary.\n\n\"What happens when COE falls? Dealers have to drop their prices and when they do, people will start returning to the showrooms,\" he said.\n\nPointing to a survey last week which showed nearly 50 per cent of people polled plan to buy a car in the next two years, he cites pent-up demand as a big factor in keeping COE premiums buoyant.\n\n\"Most showrooms over the last two weekends were quiet because people were waiting for prices to fall before they buy. We will have to see what happens this weekend but I am sure the crowds will be back,\" he said.\n\nBut he added that a more important gauge is the actual increase in COEs from next month onwards.\n\n\"In percentage terms, it sounds like a nice big figure. But in actual numbers, it is 265 more COEs for Cat B and 204 for Cat E per month, or less than 500. If each distributor takes just an extra 20 to 30 orders, that will be enough to negate any increase.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

No eggs and muffins for those guests from other hotels, even if - as is increasingly likely in major cities - everyone slept under the same roof.\n\nAt Chicago's so-called triplex - where three hotel companies share space on a city block - Starwood's Aloft guests work out in a small gym within eyesight of a much larger one shared by Marriott and Hyatt hotel guests.\n\n\"Starwood had an issue; they didn't want their guests intermingling with the other guests in the fitness area,\" said Deno Yiankes, the head of investments and development for White Lodging, which codeveloped and operates the Chicago triplex. \"Each brand has its own little hot button. Marriott and Hyatt said it wasn't a big deal, so they shared and got a bigger fitness centre.\"\n\nJuggling those competing little hot buttons is one challenge developers face as they put up more and more hotels housing two or more brands in the same building.\n\nEarly this year, Marriott opened a dual-brand hotel in New York. The lower half is a Courtyard by Marriott, while the upper floors are the Residence Inn, Marriott's extended-stay brand.\n\nThe Hyatt Hotels Corp has two dual-branded hotels and at least four more in the pipeline.\n\nHilton, which already has 15 dual-branded hotels in North America, has 17 more approved or under construction.\n\n\"It's all the rage,\" says Craig Mance, a senior vice- president for development, North America, at Hilton Worldwide.\n\nA hotel being remodelled on Chicago's Magnificent Mile will be split between Hilton's Hampton Inn brand and its Homewood Suites brand. The brands will even have some rooms mixed together on the same floor.\n\nSo even as hospitality corporations spend millions of dollars each year to create distinct brands and experiences they hope will attract repeat customers, the lines between brands are being blurred by the economics of higher land prices.\n\nDevelopers, trying to get the most out of high-priced downtown metropolitan areas, are searching for ways to slash construction costs and get as many rooms onto sites as possible.\n\nThat is easier to do with two hotels that can share a pool, exercise room, conference centres, laundry and kitchens. Those are all areas that take up space, reducing the number of available rooms. The move reduces operating costs, too.\n\n\"There are huge efficiencies to be gained by making the little sandwiches and putting them in the fridge at the limited-service hotel, running a bar at a medium- service hotel, and a full bar and restaurant at another - all being run out of the same kitchen,\" said David Kessler, the national director of the commercial real estate industry practice at CohnReznick, a consulting firm.\n\nAnd although some hotel companies are embracing dual-branding, they are struggling over how to maintain their separate identities and how to deal with the awkward logistics that can arise, like free breakfasts for some hotel guests but not others.\n\nBrands become particularly wary when it comes to mixing hotels from different corporations.\n\nChicago's triplex opened just last year with three hoteliers sharing some spaces, like laundry and meeting areas, but keeping other areas, like the gyms, as well as entrances and lobbies, separate.\n\nOthers see more difficulties ahead.\n\n\"I think that project is crazy - like crazy bad,\" argues Robert Sonnenblick, a real estate developer who constructs hotels and resorts. \"They put in hotels from three big reservations systems, all at the same price point, so that they're all competing with each other on price. Consumers are going to rate-shop the three of them and choose the lowest one. It's a race down to zero for the three competing hotels.\"\n\nA look at prices on the three corporations' websites for a king-size bed at the triplex on the same day in April showed that they were within US$10 of one another.\n\nWhite Lodging argues that hotel prices for competing brands in urban settings tend to be close, whether the hotels are on the same block or across the street from one another.\n\nAnd executives at Hyatt say the experience has provided a real-time measure of how they stack up against the competition.\n\n\"Once in a blue moon, you'll see people from the neighbouring hotel. But we still call our lobby the gallery, and we have gallery hosts who will check you in and pour you a glass of wine,\" says Chris Walker, a vice-president for Hyatt Place and Hyatt House brands. \"It's paramount to us that we have control over the lobby experience.\"\n\nMr Walker and others in the hotel industry say there are tensions and continuing debate about what elements are important and make up the total brand experience for the customer when companies consider combination developments.\n\n\"The purist in me says I don't want to give up anything. For it to be the Hyatt experience, it has to be 100 per cent. But I'm also a realist and know that that stance would dramatically eliminate a number of projects that the development team could pursue,\" says Mr Walker.\n\nSome developers say this is the future.\n\nDevelopers of the Arundel Mills property in Baltimore put in 150 Hilton Garden Inn rooms and 100 extended-stay Homewood Suites at the same site.\n\n\"We got all of the efficiencies of running the property with single housekeeping, one laundry, and amenities are also shared like the pool, fitness centre and guest laundry,\" says David Pollin, a co-founder of the Buccini/Pollin Group which built and operates the site. \"Plus, these two brands attract two different types of travellers.\"\n\nIf one brand is full, Mr Pollin adds, the group has the option to \"upgrade\" the traveller to the other.\n\nBut breakfast can be tricky.\n\n\"The Hilton Garden Inn guests are very smart and try to sneak in for the free breakfast available at the Homewood Suites,\" acknowledges Mr Pollin, who says hotel staff members try to check guest keys.\n\nHospitality executives generally do not expect many luxury properties to jump into the mix because the guest expectations vary widely.\n\n\"If you're used to getting misted at the pool, whether it's a Waldorf or a Ritz, and Mr and Mrs Smith with their 11 kids who are staying at the Hampton Inn suddenly jump in, well, that's not the kind of misting that they want,\" says Mr Mance of Hilton. \"I could see some conflicts arising out of that.\" - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

This perhaps needed to be trumpeted given that the president had cancelled his last planned trip to Asia in October at very short notice with his government facing a partial shutdown.\n\nOthers have yet brought out the underlying security equation in this relationship all too often used, as if to justify US engagement of Asia - that Washington is playing \"big brother\" to its Asian friends to deal with China's economic and military ascendance.\n\nIt seems more likely though that the US-Asia relationship needs a new narrative. Against the backdrop of the US failure to intervene in Syria and to thwart Russia's expansion into Ukraine, many questions have emerged, some of which may linger in the minds of foreign policy and security officials in Asia. Has Washington lost its zest and appetite to intervene in the name of peace? A consequent and perhaps more pertinent question then is: is the US still able to play this role as it did in the past?\n\nBoth questions are, of course, debatable but the fact that they no longer yield certain answers may cast doubt over the validity of claims that the US has got the back of its Asian allies should any conflict arise in the region.\n\nThe US may need a new hinge to its pivot if it wants to show Asia that its rebalancing was anything but rhetoric. If Washington wants to reassure Asia that the region is indeed a top priority in its foreign policy considerations, then perhaps economics, more than security, should be the thrust.\n\nLuckily for Mr Obama, such a platform already exists. The ambitious Trans-Pacific Partnership, covering 40 per cent of world trade, aims to build a comprehensive trade and economic pact that includes 12 countries - including five from Asia. However, the trade pact, which has been on the negotiating table since 2010, is far from a done deal. Participating ministers failed to reach an agreement when they met last December, missing out on the initial target of the TPP negotiations to be completed in 2013. A subsequent meeting held in February did not yield a conclusion either.\n\nOne of the biggest stumbling blocks to the deal appears to be the differences on tariffs on imported goods, particularly between US and Japan. With a strong and highly-protected domestic agricultural sector, Japan has been resisting the complete elimination of tariffs on five core products - rice, wheat, beef, pork and sugar. With the US already allowing Japan to keep its tariff on rice, wheat and sugar, the beef of the matter for now appears to be, well, beef. Japan has proposed cutting its tariff on beef imports from the US to about 15 per cent from the current 38.5 per cent while the US is calling for Tokyo to lower these taxes to below 10 per cent - a compromise from its initial position of complete abolishment of any tariffs on beef. The tariffs on pork import have also to be decided on as with the US tariffs on Japanese cars, one of its main exports.\n\nWith the bilateral ministerial discussion in Washington last week making little headway on this, it will be left to Mr Obama, who meets Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe today in a summit, to hammer out a deal.\n\nThat could well be the decisive move that defines his trip, and Washington's pivot, to Asia. It will make for a more certain and reassuring narrative between US and the region.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These high levels of government usage now need to be matched by those of individual and business usage. Efforts to reach out to small and medium-sized businesses will be critically important in that respect.\"\n\nHe noted that Singapore was the only country within Asean which has kept its place among the top five in the GITR in the past decade.\n\n\"This can be explained by the small size of Singapore's economy and its high level of income per capita, especially when compared with highly populated economies for which infrastructure, education, and sometimes poverty alleviation remain major constraints.\"\n\nBut he noted that other Asian nations were moving up the GITR rankings: Malaysia, for example, has been at the top of its income group; Korea is the worldwide champion of broadband; even the region's poorer economies such as Indonesia and the Philippines have moved up the GITR rankings in spectacular fashion this year.\n\n\"This is part of a local dynamic that will eventually benefit Singapore if the right complementarities are identified and leveraged through enhanced regional cooperation,\" he said.\n\nAmong the major Asia-Pacific nations, Japan came in 16th; Australia, 18th; China, 62nd; and India, 83rd.\n\nBesides Finland and Singapore keeping their positions as the top two most wired, Sweden (third), the Netherlands (fourth), Norway (fifth) and Switzerland (sixth) also retained their rankings from the previous year. The US moved up two places to seventh, while Hong Kong (eighth) and South Korea debuted among the top 10.\n\nThe United Kingdom was the only nation in the top ranks to fall, sliding from seventh to ninth.\n\nThe report pointed to an alarming lack of progress in bridging the \"digital divide\" between emerging or developing nations and the world's networked economies. This growing chasm suggests that less-developed economies may miss out on the many important benefits of using ICT, it said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Currently, it has two geostationary satellites in space with one of these stationed directly overhead of Singapore. It also provides customers in 160 countries with voice and data services.\n\nThe Dubai-based firm recently reported a 15 per cent increase in FY2013 revenue to US$122 million. It expects this figure to exceed US$200 million by 2018, boosted by its maritime business.\n\nSpeaking to The Business Times in Singapore recently, Sanford Jewett, Thuraya's vice president of marketing, said that while the company was relatively new to the maritime business - it launched its first maritime broadband device, the Orion IP, earlier this year - it is well positioned to gain market share quickly.\n\n\"Our main value proposition (to shipping companies) is that we are giving you more value for your investment in satellite. Some of current satellite solutions have very large antennas and require substantial investments to put it on a ship . . . Our device is relatively small, portable, easy to install and much more affordable compared to historical satellite solutions.\"\n\nHe claimed that its main selling advantage compared to Inmarsat - its prime competitor in the maritime space - is the cost savings of as much as 40 per cent that it can offer shipowners.\n\nMr Jewett made no secret that Thuraya had its eye on its closest competitor and though a newcomer, it was keen to win more market share. Its goal: a 10 per cent share of the maritime market over the next two years.\n\n\"We are trying to be a little more aggressive and creative than Inmarsat. They have been in the business for about 30 years and have sort of a monopoly position. But we are a new entrant and trying to come up with more creative and disruptive offerings.\"\n\nFor instance, he highlighted how certain maritime sectors, such as private yachts, could not afford satellite services in the past partly because they were operated seasonally. In response to this, Thuraya has come up with special pricing plans that do not penalise the owners when their vessels are not at sea.\n\nThe company is also developing a strategy to partner with fixed satellite services fleet operators, whose satellites operate mainly in the Ku- and C- bands, to gain access to the maritime market.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The institutions continue to prefer emerging markets, and alternative asset classes like real estate or private equity have been gaining allocations.\n\nManaging risk in those areas therefore become elevated in the consciousness of the institutions.\n\nBut Mr Quek also noted a heightened sensitivity at the moment to the possibility that things could go wrong.\n\n\"The market took a step back. They had five good years after the global financial crisis, where markets were trending towards the high-yield currencies . . . Fast forward to now, and there's a clear indication that they need to manage the risk, in that markets are no longer one way. This sector is willing to give up some of their returns in order to manage risk.\"\n\nIn terms of risk management, operational risk was also highlighted as a top concern, reflecting the importance that the institutions place on guarding against non-investment dangers such as inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems.\n\nThe survey was carried out in January, with 62 senior executives from various institutions taking part.\n\n\"In our interactions with the official institutions sector, there's always a lot of interest in what the peer group is doing,\" Mr Quek said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Because of Singapore's status as international centre for businesses in which receivables are typically in US dollars (from shipbuilding to fuel oil), companies with payables in Singapore dollars felt the pinch.\n\n\"While tapering has weakened the currency against the US dollar, easing this vexing situation, wariness of sharp turns in currency markets remains heightened.\"\n\nThe findings were gathered from a January survey of 639 financial officers, from companies across various industries in 12 markets in Asia.\n\nThirty-three CFOs came from Singapore, with two-thirds of these representing corporations with annual revenues of US$1 billion and above.\n\nBAML's survey, now in its third edition, also showed that less than half (45 per cent) of companies plan to engage in merger & acquisition (M&A) activities this year, with others preferring to grow organically.\n\nFor those who do have M&A plans, the focus is to do deals with Asia itself.\n\nThe top two target markets this year are India/South Asia and South-east Asia; this is in contrast with last year's results, where South-east Asia was the highest-ranked target market, with greater China following close behind.\n\nGregory Seow, BAML's South-east Asia head of Corporate Banking, said that India's upcoming election result could have been partly responsible for the increase in interest in the country, since it is anticipated that the elections will pave the way for greater reforms and openness to direct foreign investment there.\n\nHe added that domestic growth in India and South Asia remains robust, and \"offers some insurance\" against concerns that developed markets may suffer from long-term stagnation.\n\nOn a regional level, BAML said that CFOs in Asia are significantly more confident about growth prospects this year than their US counterparts: More than three-quarters (76 per cent) of Asia's finance chiefs expect revenues to grow this year, up from 72 per cent last year.\n\nThe figure far outpaces expectations for sales growth in the US edition of the survey (54 per cent). This, BAML said, \"is an endorsement of resounding confidence in (Asia's) business prospects, despite an abundance of macroeconomic and market risks\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's the biggest office Reit in Asia by market value after Japan's Nippon Building Fund Inc and Japan Real Estate Investment Corp, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe trust declined 0.6 per cent to $1.595 at the close of trading in Singapore yesterday, paring year-to-date gains to 10 per cent. The measure tracking real estate investment trusts in the island-state has advanced 4.6 per cent this year.\n\nThe Reit owns a 40 per cent stake in CapitaGreen, a 700,000 square foot office tower in the older Raffles Place financial district that's expected to be completed at the end of the year. The trust manager has commitments for about 12 per cent of the 40-storey building built on the site of an old multi-storey car park.\n\nThe landlord, which has three tenants, expects to sign new tenants for half of the space by year-end, Ms Leong said.\n\nCargill, CapitaGreen's first tenant, will pay a rent of more than $9 per square foot a month, The Business Times reported on April 11.\n\nThat's about 10 per cent more than expected by Standard Chartered's Ms Lim, according to a note to clients.\n\nThe new office tower could have tenant commitments of between 50 and 80 per cent by September, Ms Lim estimates.\n\nCapitaCommercial may buy the 60 per cent stake it doesn't own in CapitaGreen, which would become its largest asset by income and raise the proportion of grade-A assets in its portfolio to 33 per cent, according to Standard Chartered. CapitaLand and a unit of Mitsubishi Estate Co are the other owners of CapitaGreen.\n\n\"We have a call option to acquire the remaining 60 per cent of CapitaGreen from our partners between next year and 2017, so that's a clear pipeline for us,\" Ms Leong said.\n\nShe's sticking to her forecast made in January last year, when she said rents were set to rebound as supply shrinks and more businesses expand.\n\nRents in the central business district rose 8.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2013 from the same period a year earlier, according to broker Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.

And the fact that Japan's investments in Asean rose at the same time suggests that Japan Inc is still keen to invest in the region - but just not as much in China as before.\n\nThe latest numbers from the Japan External Trade Organisation (Jetro) show that Japanese investments going to China dropped 18 per cent last year, while those going to Asean almost doubled. A survey by Jetro of Japanese companies also indicates that China fell from first to fourth place as a medium-term investment destination, while Indonesia took the top spot.\n\nThere are, to be sure, plausible economic reasons for the waning of Japanese companies' interest in China. First, China's economic growth, while still respectable at 7.7 per cent last year, is slowing. Industrial production has been declining in the face of severe overcapacity in several capital goods industries (where Japanese manufacturers and exporters are strong). Chinese wage costs are also no longer as low as they used to be - they are on a par with those in Thailand and well above those in most Asean countries (except Singapore and Malaysia) as well as India. Wage growth in China's coastal provinces, where a lot of Japanese investments are concentrated, have been far outpacing increases in productivity - a clear incentive for manufacturers to shift at least their labour-intensive operations to cheaper shores. For higher-value products, weak enforcement of intellectual property rights in China is also viewed as a risk.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

MPG contributed as much as $15.1 million to the firm's 71.4 per cent jump in revenue to $33.1 million for the third quarter ended Jan 31, 2014.\n\nMr Tan noted that since XMH built generators for the marine industry, there were synergies in acquiring MPG. \"Having Mech Power in the group opens up the generator sets business in a big way for us. Since its main market is Singapore, the Mech Power business has allowed us to diversify our revenue base and balances our exposure to Indonesia,\" he explained.\n\nApart from acquisitions, XMH wants to expand to Vietnam, which it views as a priority market. The group recently announced contracts worth about $4.5 million, which allowed it to secure a foothold in Vietnam.\n\n\"Vietnam is going to be important to us going forward as we are going to spend more time and resources in that market,\" Mr Tan revealed.\n\nXMH expects to open its new facility in Tuas in the second half of 2015. The plant, which has a built-up area of about 40,000 square metres, will help boost the company's capacity for assembly work.\n\nXMH plans to leverage on the new facility to develop a logistics services business line, including warehousing.\n\nEarlier this month, XMH said that its subsidiary, Xin Ming Hua Pte Ltd, was ordered by the Singapore High Court to pay $3.47 million in damages to Pacific Marine & Shipbuilding for supplying it with defective parts.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Gross revenue rose 4.2 per cent to $75.2 million, driven by higher occupancies in flatted factories and higher rental rates secured for leases across all the property segments except business parks, the Reit said.\n\nAccording to JTC statistics, the median monthly rental rates for multi-user factory space islandwide increased slightly to $2 per square foot (psf) in the first two months of Q1. Median monthly rents for business park space fell 5.8 per cent from $4.49 psf to $4.23 psf in Q1, however, reversing the upward trend since Q2 2013.\n\nFor the full year, the trust's DPU rose 7.4 per cent to 9.92 cents, up from 9.24 cents the previous year. Net property income rose 9.9 per cent to $214.7 million, on the back of an 8.3 per cent rise in gross revenue to $299.3 million.\n\nFor the full year, management fees paid to the manager rose in tandem with the better portfolio performance and increased value of assets under management. Base fees rose 9.4 per cent to $15.5 million, and performance fees rose 9.9 per cent to $7.7 million.\n\nJTC is expected to release more industrial land supply over the next three years, which is likely to moderate rents.

This is because Soxal already has its own in-house cogen plant to meet its utilities needs.\n\n\"The project size and investment are still unclear . . . there are also environmental issues,\" the spokesman added.\n\nSoxal has invested well over $1 billion here, including in a $500 million complex on Jurong Island recently - half of which went to a world-scale hydrogen plant to supply the feedstock to customers such as Neste Oil's renewable fuel plant. Hydrogen is used to reduce sulphur content in automotive fuels and is needed to process heavy crude into useable fuels.\n\nA Linde Gas official told BT that following the RFP for the coal gasification plant in 2012, it has continued discussions with EDB. Like its competitor Soxal, Linde Gas also has its in-house unit to provide utilities. \"So the possibility of a joint venture with a power generating company will depend on the project scope. We have to explore various options,\" the official added.\n\nThis is where a genco such as Keppel Merlimau Cogen can come in. With its new combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) in operation, the genco's share of the power market here jumped to 13.3 per cent last year from 8.8 per cent in 2012, marking its highest market share level since it joined the electricity market in 2006.\n\nAsked about market talk of its interest in the coal gasification project, a Keppel spokesman said: \"Keppel notes all key developments in the energy market with keen interest. We are constantly evaluating opportunities where we can grow our business.\"\n\nBut while the cost of generating power from a coal-fired station is lower than that by a gas-fired one, one obstacle for the coal gasification project is that recent new CCGT plant building here by gencos to capitalise on LNG supplies has led to Singapore power generation capacity/supply exceeding demand.\n\nEnergy Market Company figures show that while the monthly CCGT supply reached a new high of 7,000-plus MW, forecast demand rose at a much slower pace.\n\nAnother issue is environmental sustainability. EDB earlier indicated that while the main disadvantage of coal is its environmental impact, coal gasification technology provides potential for a \"clean coal\" plant and the use of technologies such as carbon capture to reduce the project's carbon footprint.

Global operators from Las Vegas Sands to Melco Crown Entertainment have said that they are prepared to invest billions of dollars should they win permits for casinos in the world's third-largest economy.\n\nJapan's casino market could eventually generate US$40 billion in annual revenue, trailing only China's Macau as a gambling hub, CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets estimates.\n\nAdding a casino could double sales at HIS, while the effect on profit would depend on how much the company invests, Mr Sawada said. Revenue jumped to 480 billion yen, the highest since at least 1994, in the year ended October and is expected to climb 12 per cent to 536 billion yen this fiscal year, according to the average of seven analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nHIS, the country's largest listed travel agency, plans to lease land to casino developers at Huis Ten Bosch in Nagasaki on the western edge of Japan's Kyushu island. Mr Sawada bought the development in 2010, following its 2003 bankruptcy, and has returned the property to profit, partly by organising tours incorporating the park and hotels on the premises.\n\nThe travel agency is in talks with video game makers in Japan and overseas to partner on building what Mr Sawada calls a \"Game Kingdom\" at Huis Ten Bosch. He declined to name companies involved in the negotiations. The facility will offer a variety of interactive games, including a paintball-like battle simulation known as \"survival games\" in Japan.\n\nHIS is also in discussions with the Japan Racing Association, a government-affiliated group overseeing horse racing, to use its 1,800-seat theatre near the theme park as part of the expansion to add an entertainment venue, Mr Sawada said.\n\nJapanese lawmakers from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, the Japan Restoration Party and other groups submitted a bill to legalise casinos to parliament in December. Supporting lawmakers have said that they will push for passage this year. A subsequent bill detailing the rules of casino operation would also need to be approved.\n\nNagasaki Governor Houdou Nakamura said last month that the prefecture will try to introduce casino resorts with the Huis Ten Bosch area as a potential site.\n\nLocal governments in Japan's biggest cities including Tokyo, Osaka and Yokohama have said that they intend to pursue casino resort developments, as have representatives of less-populated prefectures including Nagasaki, Miyazaki, Hokkaido and Miyagi.\n\nHuis Ten Bosch is spread across 1.52 million square metres, about twice the size of Tokyo Disneyland, according to its website.\n\nHuis Ten Bosch's operating profit almost doubled to about five billion yen for the year ended October 2013, HIS said in a December statement. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

Upon landing, several of the tyres on the Airbus A380 aircraft deflated as the plane landed with a full load of fuel.\n\n\"The tyres are designed to deflate at certain brake temperatures to prevent a tyre burst. This is what happened in this case, as the aircraft landed at a heavier weight than normal,\" said a spokesman for SIA, in response to queries from The Business Times. \"At no time was safety compromised, however.\"\n\nThe passengers were forced to disembark from the aircraft onto the tarmac instead of using an aerobridge.\n\nPlanes typically land at a lighter weight vis-a-vis their take-off weight as they burn fuel over the course of the journey. In some cases, pilots may choose to dump fuel to make the aircraft lighter and easier to land.\n\nThe SIA spokesman added that the pilot did not dump fuel in this instance since this would take additional time and the cabin temperature would have been uncomfortable as the air-conditioning system had failed.\n\nA seasoned pilot BT spoke to said that the plane would be able to land safely with a full fuel tank since the tyres are designed to deflate when the brake temperatures hit a certain level.\n\nSQ322 ended up being delayed as it had to be operated using a replacement aircraft, eventually departing for London at around 11am that same day.\n\nThere was no damage to the A380, which has since returned to service, the airline said.\n\nThe counter closed at $10.28 yesterday, down one cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Starsmind, in turn, has an option to take up to 39.4 per cent of Mineriver, which holds a metals exploration permit in Xinjiang.\n\n\"The investment represents an opportunity for the group to venture into the resources market and to broaden its earnings base,\" Manhattan said in an announcement.\n\nIf exercised, the option will be paid by the issuance of up to 62 million Manhattan shares priced at 64.5 cents apiece, a 5 per cent discount to the diversified coal shipping company's volume-weighted average trade price last Thursday.\n\nThat would value Mineriver at $169 million, or about 40 per cent of the $423 million value that JES had attached to the company less than six months ago.\n\nA loss-making shipbuilder, JES this month called off its deal to acquire up to 30 per cent of Mineriver for about $127 million, choosing instead to invest in a timber business in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The move raised concerns about Mineriver, which JES had said in January was sitting on rights to 4.2 billion tonnes of resources worth upwards of US$500 billion.\n\nManhattan, which is controlled by mining tycoon Low Tuck Kwong, will bring resources and a stamp of approval for Mineriver, Mr Ho said. \"The whole thing turned out to be an endorsement by a mining tycoon. He's a strategic investor. I don't think you can hard-sell a mine to a mining investor.\"\n\nMineriver's mining asset posted net loss before tax of about 102,520 yuan (S$20,770) for the year ended Dec 31, 2012.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Customers rated carriers low on the quality of in-flight service such as beverages, bathrooms and seat comfort.\n\nAirlines with the highest satisfaction scores were JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines. United Continental had the worst score.\n\nHotels fared better than airlines in the index but lost stature as room rates went up. The overall hotel industry ranking of 75 was down from 77 in 2013.

Now, David Moyes will forever be saddled with the unwanted tag of The Sacked One. It was an announcement that, in all honesty, surprised few football fans yesterday, least of all those of Manchester United. Crowned kings of English football yet again last May but now languishing in seventh place in the league, the club gave the beleaguered Scottish manager the boot after a dreadful first season in charge.\n\nHis abrupt departure can be seen as a slap in the face for Alex Ferguson, the previous boss who, in his farewell address, wagged his finger at fans and said: \"I'd like to remind you that we've had bad times here. The club stood by me. All my staff stood by me. The players stood by me. So your job now is to stand by our new manager. That is important.\"\n\nMoyes, however, made it very difficult for them to heed those words. Some critics even went as far as to describe those instructions as emotional blackmail. As the Red Devils suffered one painful defeat after another, many of them at the club's Old Trafford stadium, the 50-year-old was brutally exposed as a man way out of his depth, at a club with expectations far too big for his boots. Clearly, the Glazer family - which bought the club in a debt-driven, US$1.4 billion purchase a decade ago - had no wish to follow Ferguson's orders, even if they did give him full control in picking his own successor.\n\nIronically, it was against Moyes' old club, Everton, where he would take charge of the 20-time league champion for the final time. That lacklustre 0-2 defeat last Sunday was the straw that broke the camel's back. The result almost certainly guarantees that Everton, in fifth, would finish above Manchester United in the table when the season is wrapped up on May 11.\n\nWas Moyes' dismissal a knee-jerk reaction? After all, he was on a lucrative six-year contract and the consensus among many was that he should be given enough time to adapt and mould his own team. Of course, football can be a very unforgiving sport. We've seen how Chelsea, under Russian billionaire owner Roman Abramovich, has hired and fired no fewer than 10 different managers over the past decade.\n\nIn Moyes' case, it didn't take a rocket scientist to notice that he had completely lost the support of his dressing room. Not that he could boast that he had it fully in the first place, but the manner in which his team played without any soul, drive or fluidity was disturbing. It has been widely reported that the Glazers were prepared to unleash a transfer war chest of as much as \u00a3200 million (S$422.8 million) this summer to rebuild the ageing team. Given Moyes' dismal track record in the two transfer windows since joining Manchester United, entrusting him to splash that much cash was a risk that the higher-ups were arguably not willing to take. Perhaps it is the right decision after all to cut the losses early and get a new broom to sweep up the mess.\n\nRyan Giggs, the club's famous winger, has been tasked to steady the ship for the remaining four games of the campaign, starting with the home fixture against relegation-threatened Norwich City this Saturday. As for Moyes, he will move on soon enough. Yes, his reputation has been tainted but deep down he's a decent, honest manager who will probably have no shortage of suitors seeking his services in due course.\n\nWhat's clear is that his short-lived stint at Manchester United eventually proved that he was The Wrong One for such a monster of a job.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Threadneedle, which entered Asia in recent years, actively manages around US$130 billion. Local banks such as DBS Bank have started to market its products.\n\nThe firm beefed up its Asian equities team recently. Mr Ng, the former chief investment officer of Nikko Asset Management, joined last October.\n\nThreadneedle's new funds will be based on three themes: equity income, sustainable growth and a contrarian strategy, he said.\n\nThe slower but more sustainable pace of growth is being deliberately driven by China's government, said Mr Ng. \"Most economies out there are still looking for stabilisation. If China manages to stabilise, it should not be a problem for other economies to stabilise as well.\"\n\nIn an environment of slower growth, the competitive landscape will not be as intense, benefiting the best players who can consolidate and focus on their strengths, instead of chasing growth. This will result in improved profitability, he said.\n\nProperty giant CapitaLand's recent privatisation of subsidiary CapitaMalls Asia is one such example. CapitaLand will have more flexibility to do integrated developments, he said.\n\nMiner BHP Billiton, which has cut capital expenditure and is spinning off non-core assets, is another example. \"They are spewing out a lot of cashflow. This will translate into either dividend income or share buybacks. It's a very positive proposition for investors,\" he said.\n\nSlower growth does not mean there will be no more growth, Mr Ng said. Asia is still one of the fastest-growing regions around. \"In the end, higher growth in Asia is going to translate into a stronger tailwind than elsewhere in the world.\"\n\nEven in China's economy, there are strong performances in some sectors, such as e-commerce, insurance and consumption-related stocks, he said.\n\nIts fixed asset growth, too, will not drop off. \"I live in Upper Bukit Timah, the MRT is being constructed. If we can find the means to spend in a very useful way even in an advanced economy like Singapore, what more China.\n\n\"The China railway sector is interesting, there is still a lot more you need to spend not just in terms of connecting cities but within cities as well.\n\n\"They have the means to spend. If they want to, they can go up to 9 per cent (GDP growth). But they shouldn't and they know that, they now have a moderation mindset.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Already, prosecutors are filing charges, and serious accusations have been lobbed against the master and his crew.\n\nIt is hoped that investigations will shed light on what went wrong, and the lessons that need to be drawn from this tragedy. The safety record in international ferry operations is now extremely good in countries (including in South Korea) which enforce International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations.\n\nBut the ferry industry has had to learn many lessons the hard, tragic way. The Herald of Free Enterprise and the Estonia disasters come to mind; in this part of the world, ship names Dona Paz, Princess of the Stars and Thomas Aquinas remind us of how badly things can go wrong.\n\nThe trade association of the global ferry industry, Interferry, has been actively promoting safety, especially recently in the small-ferry sector in developing countries. But this latest tragedy happened in a developed country, one with a well-organised and efficient maritime infrastructure and administration.\n\nIn a statement, Interferry expressed its deepest condolences to everyone affected by the Sewol tragedy. It said that although Interferry has no members in South Korea, it is always concerned about ferry safety matters in any part of the developed or developing world.\n\nInterferry noted that fatal ferry accidents are rare in developed countries such as this, but this \"does not diminish the industry's ongoing commitment to advancing safety measures\".\n\nThe trade association said that, for the Sewol tragedy, it stood ready to help the relevant authorities to understand the causes and to communicate this information, so that any necessary modification to equipment, design, operational procedures, training, regulations or enforcement are implemented.\n\nInterferry has consultative status at the IMO as a non-governmental organisation (NGO).\n\nWhether South Korea needs or accepts this assistance, the rest of the world should follow the investigation and heed the lessons that come out of it.\n\nInterferry emphasised that, in addition to technical issues, it strongly supports and advocates the continuous enhancement of strict operational requirements for crews and their supporting land-based organisations. Given what we know so far, it would be surprising if lessons about onboard organisation do not feature prominently; there may be a need to relook procedures of evacuating large numbers of passengers quickly.\n\nWhile the terrible events unfolded off the Korean peninsula, another ferry incident off Singapore last Saturday had a happy ending: A female Singaporean ferry passenger on board the Singapore-flagged ferry Sindo Empress who went missing during the journey between Tanjong Pengelih in Johor and Singapore's Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal has been found.\n\nShe had been rescued by a fishing vessel and taken to Batam in Indonesia, and is apparently safe and well.\n\nThe Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) had coordinated a search-and-rescue operation involving the Police Coast Guard, Malaysia Marine Enforcement Agency, the Batam Port Authority and the Tanjung Pinang Rescue Coordination Centre.\n\nThat was a glimmer of light in what was a very dark weekend for those in the maritime business.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

UIC kicked things off with its offer for Singapore Land, CapitaLand then grabbed the headlines with its plan to buy out all of CapitaMalls Asia (CMA), and a private consortium headed by Hotel Properties' boss Ong Beng Seng tabled a takeover of HPL that could eventually lead to HPL being delisted.\n\nThis, in turn, has sparked off a search for the next big privatisation play and driven the local market higher, as if this was something to be celebrated and trumpeted.\n\nTruth be told, it isn't.\n\nOn the contrary, it is a damning indictment of a market aspiring to be a major gateway for global finance that good quality companies are being persistently mispriced by a supposedly efficient market. It isn't really efficient by any stretch, but let's pretend for argument's sake that it is. But once the delistings are done and dusted, a void will appear that will take years to fill.\n\nThe main victims of the market's mispricing are minority shareholders. In almost all cases - those past and present - there is unhappiness at \"low\" offer prices. In the case of the present crop of takeovers which are primarily property plays for which asset/book values are generally used as valuation benchmarks, one complaint is that the discount to asset values is simply too large to be considered fair. Another related complaint is that if there is a multiple of book value offered - as is the case with CMA (more on this later) - it isn't large enough.\n\nWhile sympathies must lie with shareholders whose entry prices are higher than the offer price, it is a fact of commercial life that some will win and some will lose. Those who bought in the most recent months prior to offers being made would be the biggest winners; those who bought years earlier when the market price was higher could feel aggrieved.\n\nOfferors, however, are not in the game of making everyone happy, and will always try for the lowest price they can secure. This can often mean not offering full value. Instead, their game plan is to put forth a price that is just sufficiently higher than the prevailing market to hopefully entice majority acceptance, but is low enough to allow for a margin to be made after full ownership is achieved.\n\nIn other words, it is a careful balancing act that involves straddling the market on the one hand, and other valuation benchmarks on the other.\n\nIn the case of CapitaLand/CMA, for example, the $2.22 that CapitaLand is offering is the highest in about 15 months, even though it is only 1.2x CMA's $1.87 book value per share. The latter, it has been argued, is too low since, when CMA listed some three-and-a-half years ago, it was priced at 1.55x book value.\n\nThis is true, but it is equally correct to say that CMA has languished for many more days at below $2.22 since it was listed than above it, which suggests that shareholders have had to put up with years of undervaluation. In fact, the stock has traded above $2.22 only once in the last three years.\n\nAlso, the $2.22 is a premium of 27 per cent over the prevailing market, which is much better than the 15.6 per cent offered to HPL shareholders, the 17 per cent offered for Global Premium Hotels and the 16.9 per cent for SingLand.\n\nSeen in this context, it means the CMA offer is decent given existing circumstances. Not earth-shatteringly generous, mind you, but decent.\n\nWhether shareholders accept remains to be seen, but the point is that CMA and all the others before it illustrate the harsh reality that sometimes market prices will not necessarily reflect economic or perceived realities.\n\nMinority shareholders might think that an efficient market should recognise value when it sees it but this is not always the case. If you look hard enough, it's even possible to find companies trading below their cash values, never mind asset values.\n\nThis has been a perennial problem with all markets, but possibly one that has been accentuated over the past year in Singapore with international investors shunning emerging markets in the wake of the US Federal Reserve's tapering of its monetary stimulus.\n\nUltimately, shareholders of offeree companies have to ask themselves if they should wait for the market to \"correctly\" price their shares - in which case it could take years because of perennial market failure - or take what's on the table now.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And so, a flurry of activity ensued, during which the garden-variety Internet user exchanged one weak password, such as '1234', for another, such as '4321', and called it good. As firms lumbered reactively towards a solution, they too risked oversimplifying the issue on a larger scale.\n\nThe Heartbleed bug is more than another quirkily named problem; it is symptomatic of a disquieting reliance on open-source programs. The code that the bug compromised - the secure sockets layer (SSL), ironically designed to make the Internet more secure - is an open-source one.\n\nThe open-source concept is a double-edged sword - being free to use and repurpose, its bounty is for everyone to reap, but its drawbacks are nobody's responsibility. This is why the Heartbleed vulnerability took two years to detect. Open-source code is used by virtually everyone, from the giants of Silicon Valley to large governments. These codes, so entrenched in critical systems and everyday businesses, are built and maintained by volunteers - a concept that would be unacceptable in any other field, such as manufacturing or consulting.\n\nThe cost of security breaches can be immense, Heartbleed bug aside. One cybersecurity firm estimates that each lost record costs the financial sector US$215. Perpetrators of cybercrime are not mere juvenile miscreants, for the sectors that are heavily targeted suggests that the prospect of lucre is a motivating factor. In Singapore, the most commonly targeted industries for malware are professional services, healthcare and chemicals.\n\nOn top of the costs borne by corporations, there are externalities that other parties pay dearly for. According to Symantec, more than 552 million identities were exposed last year through security breaches which fed the criminal underground with individuals' credit card information, birth dates, government ID numbers, home addresses, medical records and financial information.\n\nNow, the Heartbleed bug should be seen as an opportunity for companies to give the idea of developing proprietary systems some serious thought.\n\nIt is quite likely that proprietary systems will sacrifice the wealth of innovation from many collaborators working on it in an open-source environment. Costs will also be driven up, eating into margins or being passed on to consumers or taxpayers.\n\nBut as these potential costs are weighed, it should also be considered that the Canadian police have arrested a man for exploiting the Heartbleed bug to steal taxpayer data from a government website. Other similar instances will surely follow. As governments and corporations do their sums, they must think about whether they can afford the worst possible outcome.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Beijing's increasingly assertive stance on maritime security in what it sees as its territorial waters has stoked concerns in the region, particularly as its military and civilian ships increase patrols in disputed areas.\n\nChinese and Japanese ships routinely shadow each other near a chain of disputed islets in the East China Sea, a development which analysts have said raises the risk of a conflict. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

In fact, there is ample evidence that markets are often irrational, overshooting fundamental values on the upside and downside. This is because investors themselves are irrational, driven largely by excesses of fear and greed.\n\nBehavioural finance is an academic discipline that has emerged to study investor behaviour, errors and the human decision-making process. As Vanguard said in a paper, behavioural finance takes insights from psychology and applies them to financial decision making.\n\nHere are some of those which have emerged on human biases that often lead to investment missteps:\n\nOverconfidence:\n\nPeople tend to have \"unwarranted confidence\" in their decision making, Vanguard said. In the investment realm, this is manifested when investors overestimate their ability to pick winners or to time markets. They typically go against the advice to diversify.\n\nVanguard cited a study of affluent investors who reported that their stock-picking skills were crucial to the portfolio's success. \"In reality, they were unduly optimistic about the performance of the shares they chose, and underestimated the effect of the overall market on their portfolio's performance.\"\n\nOvertrading:\n\nInvestors who have too much confidence in their abilities often trade too often, with negative effects on their portfolio. Vanguard cited research by Brad Barber and Terry Odean, who studied retail brokerage accounts. They found that the most active traders earned the lowest returns.\n\nLoss aversion:\n\nBehavioural finance suggests that people more strongly prefer to avoid loss than to have a gain. Some studies suggest that the emotions arising from losses are twice as powerful as gains. In investments, this is seen in investors' reluctance to realise a loss. They are likely to hold on to losses in the desire to break even. Vanguard said: \"This means the investor shows highly risk-averse behaviour when facing a profit (selling and locking in the sure gain) and more risk tolerant or risk-seeking behaviour when facing a loss (continuing to hold the investment and hoping its price rises again).\n\nPast performance as indicator of the future:\n\nInvestors often base their decisions on the historical performance of stocks. This leads to a tendency to extrapolate past price trends into the future.\n\nInertia:\n\nConfusion, uncertainty and the desire to avoid loss may cause investors to freeze and procrastinate on their investment decision. That is why some pension funds have \"autopilot\" schemes where members who fail to make a choice are put into a default asset allocation.\n\nRules of thumb:\n\nThis is one of the major findings of behavioural finance research, that investors often use heuristics or \"rules of thumb\" to make decisions rather than a rational analysis. There are some major biases at play. One is anchoring, where investors use a fixed value or stock price as a reference point or anchor, rather than objective analysis. For instance, investors may watch a stock drop in price from a previous high, and refuse to sell until it retouches the previous high. The historical high, however, may have no bearing on where the stock may trend in the future.\n\nAnother related bias is called recency, where people place more importance on recent events, projecting that into the future. This may explain why following the 2008 crash, many investors remained on the sidelines, even in the face of evidence that world economies were on the mend.\n\nAll these biases are reasons why most investors need a financial adviser to help them to overcome inertia and make reasoned decisions. A discretionary portfolio, where the manager makes decisions on asset allocation and individual securities, also helps.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Just ask Wall Street's biggest bond dealers. While the losses that their economists predicted have yet to materialise, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and the 20 other firms that trade with the Federal Reserve began wagering on a treasuries selloff last month for the first time since 2011. The strategy was upended as Fed chair Janet Yellen signalled that she wasn't in a rush to lift interest rates, two weeks after suggesting the opposite at the bank's March 19 meeting.\n\nThe surprising resilience of treasuries has investors re-calibrating forecasts for higher borrowing costs as lacklustre job growth and emerging-market turmoil push yields towards 2014 lows. That has also made the business of trading bonds, once more predictable for dealers when the Fed was buying trillions of dollars of debt to spur the economy, less profitable as new rules limit the risks they can take with their own money.\n\n\"You have an uncertain Fed, an uncertain direction of the economy and you've got rates moving,\" Mark MacQueen, a partner at Sage Advisory Services Ltd, which oversees US$10 billion, said by telephone from Austin, Texas.

For the most part, it has been developing industrial parks and now has 11 projects in China, Vietnam and Indonesia.\n\nDescribing the strategy shift, Mr Teo said: \"Typically in the past, what we did in our land master planning was to sell land to third party (residential and commercial) property developers. Now we twist our business model and ask if we can do it ourselves. This is why we reactivated the subsidiary - to do property.\"\n\nWith the revival of the unit, Sembcorp Properties will become a subsidiary of Sembcorp Development.\n\nSembcorp Properties became dormant after the 1998 merger between Sembawang Corp and Singapore Technologies Industrial Corp (STIC) which resulted in the present-day Sembcorp. At the time, Sembcorp identified engineering and technology as its competitive advantage and exited many of its other non-core areas. Property development was one of them.\n\nMr Teo said the company is pursuing property development for several reasons: firstly, as a \"catalyst project\" to drive new projects it embarks on and convince other project participants to come onboard; and secondly, to set a quality standard for others within its own township settlement.\n\nOf course, this would also address the housing requirements of employees working in those industrial or business parks.\n\nSembcorp will begin with building mid- to high-end residential developments in the Singapore-Sichuan Hi-tech Innovation Park in Chengdu, Sichuan province, and the Sino-Singapore Nanjing Eco Hi-tech Island in Jiangxinzhou, Jiangsu province.\n\n\"China will be our first priority. We see a strong demand for houses in Nanjing and Chengdu; they have reached a very mature stage for housing needs. We have been tracking their monthly housing price trend and market absorption rates. These two cities have moderate growth, so we thought these will be our first focus,\" Mr Teo said.\n\n\"We have no time-frame for when we are building the first development, but it won't be too far off.\"\n\nEmployees at Nanjing, which aims to become a centre for high-tech innovation, are of the \"high disposal income type\", while those in the Sichuan innovation park tend to be researchers, scientists and bankers, he said.\n\nBoth Chinese projects are \"strongly endorsed\" by the Singapore government and have helped to create employment for many Chinese graduates, attract foreign direct investment to China and improve the Sino-Singapore bilateral relationship.\n\nMr Teo added that any commercial developments that follow will be amenities to support the residential developments.\n\nMeanwhile, Sembcorp is not ruling out tying up with other developers, local or foreign, for their development strengths or unique capabilities.\n\nWhile Sembcorp has the advantage of being able to acquire land at lower prices, through negotiations rather than bidding, developers still command a better premium, given their track record and expertise. Besides, land cost is only a small fraction of development costs in China, unlike in Singapore.\n\nTo be sure, Sembcorp Development already has existing residential projects in the Wuxi-Singapore Industrial Park, a joint venture with the Wuxi government which Sembcorp has a 45.4 per cent stake in. To attract people to work at the business and IT park there, two residential blocks and a 120-room serviced apartment block operated by Fraser Hospitality have been added.\n\nUltimately, the urban development pillar is not standalone but enjoys synergy with the group's power and water management capabilities.\n\n\"We can offer the total holistic solution to our customers. As a group, we can do it all under one roof, unlike competitors who outsource these services to others and cannot control the services,\" Mr Teo said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The company announced last year-end that it had submitted a trading resumption plan to Singapore Exchange (SGX).\n\nInvestor Mano Sabnani said SGX should take notice of the shareholder approval of accounts and expedite trading.\n\n\"There is no point in punishing shareholders who are innocent,\" he said, adding that it could be \"unduly long\" if SGX wanted to wait for the Commercial Affairs Department to complete investigations.\n\nShares in China Sky have been suspended since November 2011, after SGX directed it to appoint a special auditor to investigate certain affairs of the company.\n\nThe firm initially refused but eventually appointed Stone Forest Corporate Advisory in October 2012. The report, released last June, said China Sky had failed to make mandatory disclosures, included wrong information in share market announcements, and had undertaken a major transaction without shareholder approval.\n\nThe company has since appointed CNP Compliance as its compliance adviser.\n\nChina Sky posted two consecutive years of net losses, with a 632.1 million yuan (S$128 million) loss in 2012, largely from impairment losses. In 2013, it narrowed its losses to 68.1 million yuan, though revenue fell 33.5 per cent year on year to 1.99 billion yuan.\n\nIt said in its 2013 annual report: \"Given the uncertainties of the global business environment, directors expect to continue operating in the challenging environment for the first half of 2014.\"\n\nAs at Dec 31, 2013, net asset value per share was 287.51 RMB cents, against 295.86 RMB cents a year earlier.\n\nChina Sky last traded at 10.2 cents on Nov 16, 2011, before the trading suspension.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It added that it was seeking legal advice and evaluating the financial impact of this development.\n\nThe contract, secured in August 2011, was worth $32.3 million. It was awarded by developer Orion-One Residential to CCM subsidiary CCM Industrial. The latter was to build a 23-storey residential flat with a five-storey car park, swimming pool, communal facilities and a sky terrace, at 6 Jalan Ampas.\n\nThe freehold project was marketed under the name The Viridian@Bales-tier. Construction was scheduled to start in October 2011 and was originally slated to be completed in October last year. According to a marketing website, the project was expected to be completed in the middle of this year, with prices from $785,000.\n\nA source, who declined to be named, told The Business Times that the project was marketed more than a year ago and had sold quite well. \"There was pretty good sales volume. At that time, market sentiment was still pretty decent and cooling measures weren't as severe as today,\" he said.\n\nCCM Industrial also had its Eon Shenton project worth $94.6 million terminated on March 20. This was a contract to build a 32-storey commercial building at 70 Shenton Way. On March 27, the company revealed that it had to pay a performance bond of $4.73 million, which was provided for in its 2013 financial statements.\n\nCCM has announced plans to get out of its unprofitable Singapore construction projects and go into property development in the US and Australia. In its 2013 financial year results, CCM reported a $22.4 million loss. It also made an $8.7 million provision for losses stemming from higher costs of completion.\n\nThe provision was due to a raw material price increase, sub-contractor fees, a delay in the completion of projects, and other overheads and bad debts. CCM also made a $3 million provision for a legal claim relating to a subcontractor dispute.\n\nThe company announced a fund-raising exercise on April 8, in part \"to discharge costs of its Singapore construction projects, repay and redeem liabilities and pursue property development opportunities overseas, particularly the United States and Australia\".\n\nOn April 17, CCM said that it was disposing CCM Industrial, its local construction arm, for $1. The subsidiary had been fully impaired in its 2013 financial statements, and its net tangible liability was $7.7 million.\n\nThe new construction arm of CCM, called Singapore Construction, will take over CCM Industrial's remaining projects. Management is separate from CCM Industrial, CCM had said on April 10. The topline revenue attributable to Singapore Construction for existing projects is $7 million.\n\nWhen reached by phone yesterday, a lawyer representing CCM declined to comment on its lawsuits, citing client confidentiality.\n\nCCM made a number of major announcements recently on its change of direction from construction to property development. It announced its first property development project in Texas, in the US, in February. It is also bidding for a project in Perth, Australia.\n\nCCM shares have been on a downtrend. They fell 0.1 cent, or 12.5 per cent, to 0.7 cent yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Bank of Singapore's Hou Wey Fook shares what these are with GENEVIEVE CUA\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Apr 22, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIF you have been investing for some time, you are likely to have made some decisions that you regret. These include entering or exiting the market at - on hindsight - the wrong time, investing in a company that then went bankrupt or having to top up a loss-making account due to a margin call.\n\nFear and greed are powerful human emotions that often cause investors to sell at the market's bottom or to buy at the peak. It may take years just to get your investment or portfolio back to an even keel. An asset that drops in value by half will need to rise by 100 per cent for you to recoup your capital.\n\nTime and again, Bank of Singapore managing director and chief investment officer Hou Wey Fook has seen investment missteps by both high-net-worth and retail clients. \"Clients must have a core/satellite approach. To make 6 to 7 per cent consistently, year after year, is not an easy feat. It's not an unrealistic return, but to really harness that, you need to be there for the long term. You need to structure your portfolio according to your objectives and the volatility you can take.\"\n\nA core/satellite approach relies on the principles of asset allocation, that is, picking a combination of asset classes that best matches your risk tolerance and return objectives. The core portfolio may comprise an efficient mix of fixed income and equities. Pension funds and institutions tap index funds for the core allocation, which ensures market participation at lower costs. The satellite portion may comprise actively managed funds, alternative investments or other investments that offer a chance to outperform the market, although they may be illiquid or carry higher investment costs.\n\nThe core/satellite approach cushions investors from their emotions. This is because the core portfolio typically has a strategic asset allocation and objective, and should not be heavily traded. Those clients who may want to dabble in speculative stocks or currency trading may do so in the satellite portion, which should comprise a relatively modest share of overall assets.\n\nMr Hou shares some common human foibles and misconceptions that may be costly in terms of performance:\n\nHome bias:\n\nThis is very common and refers to investors' tendency to invest at or close to home. Home bias typically covers investments here and in the region. \"Clients made money on their own turf in property or business, yet in their bankable assets, they buy the same old things,\" he said.\n\nThis bias in favour of Singapore and Asia is likely to have caused investors to miss out on the strong returns generated by developed markets in the past couple of years. World equities delivered 19 per cent returns in the 12 months to end-March. Europe and the US generated 21 per cent returns, while Asia ex-Japan scraped by with 2.3 per cent returns.\n\nIn its latest Monthly Investment Guide this month, Bank of Singapore head of equity research Sean Quek and equity analyst Camelia Goh remain positive about US equities, taking the view that US growth acceleration remains on track. They said: \"Valuations, while no longer cheap, are still not demanding, especially given the improving growth outlook.\"\n\nOn Asia ex-Japan, they maintain a \"cautious and selective\" stance.\n\nEconomic growth and returns:\n\nInvestors often equate economic growth with positive stock returns, and this is typically how funds are marketed. But this is not necessarily the case. Mr Hou cited some interesting statistics. In the past 20 years, China has posted strong economic growth of about 10 per cent a year, against the US' growth rate of about 2.8 per cent. But equity returns in China, based on H shares over the past 20 years, has been just 3 per cent a year; returns on US equities, which suffered the bursting of the technology bubble and a major financial crisis in 2008, was 9 per cent annualised.\n\nSaid Mr Hou: \"In a perfect market, economic growth leads to earnings and higher share prices. But earnings can be accounting earnings and not real.\"\n\nOther factors that could explain China's underperformance may be poor corporate governance and market structure. \"The difference between the US and China is very stark. In the US, the market structure is such that there are huge institutions, pension, insurance and endowment funds. If the market comes down there is always a bid. In China, there are many leakages.\"\n\nMisunderstanding bond returns:\n\nMr Hou said investors tend to extrapolate bond returns into the future, and do this with equity returns as well. But there is a big difference between the two asset classes. In bonds, investors extend credit to companies. They earn an interest rate and get their principal back when the bond matures. Investing in equities, on the other hand, gives you a share in the company's growth.\n\n\"Distributors tend to push bonds after a good year. But bond returns are finite ... In equities, you may extrapolate returns because equities are driven by growth and earnings. For bonds, mathematically, you can't chase returns.\"\n\nThis principle is even more pointed today as bonds are at the tail end of a 30-year bull market. Ten-year Treasury yields have crept upwards in the past year, and are expected to trend higher as the Federal Reserve shifts to a more orthodox policy stance. This suggests that investors currently holding bonds may not expect much in terms of price appreciation, although they will continue to collect coupons.\n\nChasing performance:\n\nInvestors tend to want to invest in assets that have already done well. This is why mutual funds are typically launched when the underlying assets' prices have peaked - to investors' detriment.\n\nThis tendency to chase performance typically leads to regret. A client may start out with a conservative profile, and is happy with a steady 5 per cent return. He is recommended a portfolio that is 80 per cent bonds and 20 per cent stocks. But seeing the strong equity returns of the past year, he may be unhappy.\n\n\"We say, that's your original mandate. To change it requires a change in the risk profile ... A lot of people started in 2013 with a fixed income mandate because in 2012, fixed-income returned 15 to 20 per cent. They were chasing returns. But in bonds, you can't extrapolate returns. In 2013, I clearly told investors the yield is 5 per cent and you'll get that over a cycle. It may be lower this year.\"\n\nOvertrading:\n\nInvestors tend to trade too much. This reflects overconfidence in their abilities and a tendency to be \"anchored\" or tethered to a certain reference point, even though it may not be logical. A common practice, for instance, is to \"average down\" the purchase of a stock when its price drops, because you are anchored to the historical highs at which it has traded.\n\nThis ignores fundamental factors that may account for its falling price, such as a negative change in the business environment or poor corporate governance issues.\n\nAnchoring causes other mistakes, most famously the tendency to sell winners too soon and to hold on to losers. Mr Hou said: \"When you sell something too quickly, you will never buy that stock back. Say, you bought a stock at $2 and it went to $2.50. You made 25 per cent. It's a good stock story that is still unfolding and it goes all the way to $10. But you never participate because you are anchored to the $2.50 price.\"\n\nOverconfidence and overtrading typically also leads to excessive leverage, which can wipe out your portfolio - and more - should prices head the wrong way. Leverage is a double-edged blade, juicing up returns when markets rise and magnifying losses when markets fall.\n\nConcentration risk:\n\nTypically, clients are told not to put all their eggs into a single proverbial basket. But some investors take on concentrated risks in stocks, because they may be familiar with the underlying businesses and growth prospects. While there are risks to this strategy, the arguably larger mistake may be concentration risk in bonds, said Mr Hou. This occurs when clients hold just a few credits, which comprise the majority of their portfolio.\n\n\"When I first joined the bank, I noticed a lot of concentration risk in bonds. You should never take that risk in bonds because you are not paid to do that.\"\n\nWarren Buffett, for example, takes concentrated risks in a handful of stocks. \"One stock can go up by 50 or 100 per cent. Another stock may not do anything or may lose money. If you are right, you are paid handsomely for the risk. So you may argue that you can take concentration risk in stocks. But for bonds, how much more are you paid between one bond and another? Two per cent more? Never take concentrated bets on bonds. This is something clients are beginning to see.\"\n\nThe power of compounding:\n\nClients often underestimate or fail to appreciate the power of compounding. An investment may rise by a modest amount in any single year, but with a long-term perspective, this adds up into a substantial pot over 10 or 20 years. Mr Hou said: \"If you put $1 into an investment with a 7 per cent return, in 10 years you double your money. In 20 years, the sum quadruples. It's a very simple concept but people want instant gratification. That's why they go to the casino, and they leverage on stocks.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These are set to rise as the group increases production, AsiaPhos said yesterday.\n\nAsiaPhos will take over the economic benefits currently belonging to Dashan, and expects to benefit from cost savings - and higher profit margins - in doing so.\n\nThis will be done by having its wholly owned subsidiary, AsiaPhos Resources, subscribe for $10-$15 million of 12.5 per cent convertible loan notes in LY Resources. The latter will hold Dashan's economic benefits from the cooperation agreement, as well as a 55 per cent stake in another Chinese firm, Deyang Fengtai Mining Co (FengTai), with a licence to explore for barite rocks.\n\nThese notes, due in October 2016, can be converted into ordinary shares in LY Resources.\n\nThe FengTai licence, which allows for exploration over a 17.91-sq-km area close to AsiaPhos's existing mines in Sichuan, expires on Dec 12 next year. A subsidiary of AsiaPhos will also enter into an agreement with FengTai for a right of first refusal to acquire the mineral deposits and rocks mined from the area at a 20 per cent discount to the market price.\n\nAt the same time, AsiaPhos also entered into another agreement with Luo Yong - who owns 50 per cent of Dashan and 55 per cent of Deyang - in which the latter will have a put option to sell the shares of LY Resources to AsiaPhos, and AsiaPhos has a corresponding call option to require him to sell all the shares.\n\nThis is conditional on certain criteria, such as a professional independent valuation of LY Resources and its subsidiaries not being less than 250 million yuan.\n\nIf AsiaPhos exercises these options and converts the convertible loan notes, it will gain equity control of LY Resources.\n\nAsiaPhos CEO Ong Hian Eng said these agreements will not only lead to improved financial performance, but the additional land parcel could also result in economies of scale and operational synergies.\n\n\"Furthermore, with a larger business operation base, we will be better positioned to raise capital and potentially achieve better terms for capital-raising,\" said Dr Ong.\n\nAsiaPhos said it will use both internal resources and external funding to pay for the subscription of the notes.\n\nWhen the put or call option is exercised, the amount to be paid will be funded through the issuance of new ordinary shares in AsiaPhos, with an issue price of between 25 and 30 cents.\n\nAsiaPhos said two weeks ago that its mine exploration right for a 0.55-sq-km plot in Mianzhu, Sichuan had expired, but it was expecting it to be approved within 40 working days starting from April 10. Otherwise, the firm's output and financial performance for the current financial year \"may be adversely affected\".\n\nThe news lifted the counter's share price to an intra-day high of 18.1 cents yesterday. The stock closed 0.3 cent higher at 17.5 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

His voice was shaking and sounded urgent, a fire officer told MBC TV. It took a while to identify the ship as the Sewol. \"Save us! We're on a ship and I think it's sinking,\" Yonhap news agency quoted him as saying.\n\nThe fire service official asked him to switch the phone to the captain, and the boy replied: \"Do you mean teacher?\"\n\nThe pronunciation of the words for \"captain\" and \"teacher\" is similar in Korean.\n\nThe captain of the ship, Lee Joon-seok, 69, and other crew members have been arrested on negligence charges. Lee was also charged with undertaking an \"excessive change of course without slowing down\".\n\nSeveral crew members, including the captain, left the ferry as it was sinking, witnesses have said, after passengers were told to stay in their cabins. President Park Geun-hye said on Monday that instruction was tantamount to an \"act of murder\".\n\nMany of the children did not question their elders, as is customary in hierarchical Korean society. They paid for their obedience with their lives.\n\nFour crew members appeared in court yesterday and were briefly questioned by reporters before being taken back into custody. One unidentified second mate said they had tried to reach the lifeboats, but were unable to because of the tilt.\n\nOnly two of the vessel's 46 lifeboats were deployed.\n\nTwo first mates, one second mate and the chief engineer stood with their heads lowered and it was impossible to tell who was speaking.\n\nOne said there had been a mistake as the boat made a turn.\n\nAnother said there was an eventual order to abandon ship. He said the crew gathered on the bridge and tried to restore balance, but could not. \"Maybe the steering gear was broken,\" one said.\n\nMedia said the ship lost power for 36 seconds, which could have been a factor.\n\nPublic broadcaster KBS, quoting transcripts of the conversation between the crew and sea traffic control, the Jindo Vessel Traffic Services Centre, said the passengers were told repeatedly to stay put.\n\nFor half an hour, the crew on the third deck kept asking the bridge by walkie-talkie whether or not they should make the order to abandon ship, KBS said.\n\nNo one answered.\n\n\"At the time, we could not confirm what the situation was on the bridge,\" KBS quoted a crew member as saying.\n\n\"We kept trying to find out but ... since there was no instruction coming from the bridge, the crew on the third floor followed the instructions on the manual and kept making 'stay where you are' announcements. At least three times.\"\n\nLee was not on the bridge when the ship turned. Navigation was in the hands of a 26-year old third mate who was in charge for the first time on that part of the journey, according to crew members. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/singapore-4th-most-connected-country-mckinsey-study", "site_title": "Singapore the 4th most connected country: McKinsey study", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nSingapore the 4th most connected country: McKinsey study\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Apr 22, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] A lesson learnt well by Singapore over the years is that to prosper it needs to be a global hub for flow of goods and services. New research by McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) shows that this has paid off.\n\nThe Republic ranks fourth in the world in terms of connectedness and is identified as one of six major cities which are hubs for all types of cross-border flows. The top three nations are Germany at No 1 followed by Hong Kong and the US. The report which comes out today is based on data from 2012.\n\nThe MGI Connectedness Index report tracks inflows and outflows (together called \"flows\") of goods, services, finance and people, as well as the underlying flows of data and communication that cut across all of them.\n\nPowered by rising prosperity in the emerging world and the spread of Internet and digital technologies, cross-border movement of goods, services, finance, people and data already account for 15-25 per cent of global GDP growth. This translates to about US$250 billion to US$450 billion a year. Such flows could triple in the next decade and economies, companies, and people who do not participate in these expanding networks of connectivity risk being left behind.\n\nSingapore and Hong Kong are the only two Asian representatives in the top 10 economies in the index.\n\nSpeaking to The Business Times, Susan Lund, MGI partner and one of the authors of the report, notes that Hong Kong ranks above Singapore on goods flows and financial flows, but behind on service flows - but all these are within one place of each other. The major difference is on people flows, where Hong Kong is four places above Singapore. Hong Kong thus gets the second position to Singapore's fourth.\n\nDr Lund said it's not sufficient to look at flow intensity alone - an economy's level of flow relative to gross domestic product - because, in dollar terms, this leaves the world's largest and more diversified economies looking relatively closed.\n\nThis happens because a relatively small share of their overall economic activity happens across borders. Conversely, smaller economies look exaggeratedly prominent in flows because they inevitably have larger flows of goods, services, and finance compared with the size of their GDP.\n\nDeveloped economies tend to be more connected than emerging economies. The gap between developed and emerging economies is more pronounced in flows of data and communication, reflecting disparity in Internet access - often called the digital divide.\n\nCities often act as waypoints that link large parts of networks. Singapore's high ranking is mainly driven by its trade intensity, given its role as a waypoint. The report notes that only six cities are major hubs across all types of flows - Dubai, London, Hong Kong, New York, Singapore and Tokyo.\n\nSingapore's strength as an intermediary for goods and financial flows and its high participation in other flows resulted in its overall fourth ranking, according to McKinsey. The study adds that its ascendancy has been underpinned by rapid growth of cross-border Internet traffic that has grown at 1.5 times the rate of the average of developed economies over the past five years.\n\nIt ranks fourth for connectedness in global financial flows. Outbound lending flows have grown almost 30 per cent over the past decade, reflecting the establishment of many global banks in Singapore as a regional Asian hub. The regional expansion of Singaporean banks such as DBS has greatly facilitated the outflows of loans to Asia, says McKinsey.\n\nThe Republic's role as a major waypoint is further reflected in its above-average level of connectedness to people and data flows. Singapore ranks 11th on cross-border Internet traffic, which grew at 67 per cent a year between 2005 and 2013, compared with a global average of 46 per cent.\n\nDr Lund adds that it was surprising but also revealing that the major Asian export powerhouses of Japan, South Korea and China are less connected when using MGI's broader definition - particularly in people flows and migration, and also in cross-border Internet traffic. This reflects their strong focus on manufacturing exports but less focus on other forms of openness to the global economy.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

No wreckage has yet been found.\n\n\"Bluefin-21 has now completed more than 80 per cent of the focused underwater search area and further missions are planned,\" the Perth-based Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) told Reuters. \"The search will continue. We are currently consulting very closely with our international partners on the best way to effect this for the future.\"\n\nAs the Bluefin embarked on its 10th trip to depths of more than 4.5km, some 2,000km north-west of of Perth, a tropical cyclone heading south over the Indian Ocean suspended the air search.\n\n\"It has been determined that the current weather conditions are resulting in heavy seas and poor visibility, and would make any air search activities ineffective and potentially hazardous,\" the JACC said.\n\nThe ships involved in the day's search about 1,600km north-west of Perth would continue with their planned activities, the centre added.\n\nThe search coordinator, retired Australian air chief marshal Angus Houston, said on April 14 that the air and surface component of the operation would end about a week ago.\n\nBut daily sorties have continued unabated in what is shaping to be the most expensive search in aviation history, involving some two dozen nations.\n\n\"There will be no change to our mission of one nine-hour flight per day,\" US 7th Fleet public affairs officer Commander William Marks told Reuters yesterday.\n\nMeanwhile, a statement attributed to the families of passengers on board the missing flight accused the Malaysian government of giving information about the investigation to the media before them and demanded \"regular pre-payments\" of compensation before the investigation was complete.\n\nMany family members have been critical of the Malaysian government's handling of the so far fruitless search. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Dubbed \"mobile virtual network operators\" (MVNO), they buy airtime wholesale from local telcos and resell them to consumers.\n\nThere are now about five or six active MVNOs in Singapore, with a market share of less than one per cent - or about 80,000 - of the country's total mobile subscriber base.\n\nThese operators serve a largely migrant or foreign community, such as Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT), which markets a service called Smart Pinoy that sells prepaid local SIM cards here.\n\n\"IDA wants to inject more competition in the mobile market, which could lead to lower prices and more innovative services. Niche markets could also be better served,\" an IDA spokeswoman said.\n\nWith more MVNOs in the market, IDA also envisions retailers of high-speed broadband services having the chance to tie up with the former, creating bundled triple-play offerings and \"deepening competition in both the fixed line and mobile broadband markets,\" it said in its consultation paper.\n\nIf IDA decides to prod this development forward, mobile network operators such as SingTel, StarHub and M1 could also face regulatory prodding.\n\nTelcos could either be encouraged to voluntarily host MVNOs on their network with spectrum allocation being dangled as a carrot, or simply made to allocate a minimum percentage of network capacity for these niche players. Also, wholesale pricing - now left to market forces - could be regulated to encourage MVNO entry. The consultation paper now invites views on the merits of these various approaches.\n\nLast year, the door for a fourth mobile network operator (MNO) was held open - 4G spectrum was set aside for a new player - but no one walked through it.\n\nThis focus on MVNOs is a similar attempt to foster competition, even as the door for a new MNO is kept ajar. \"While IDA remains open to having interested parties entering the local market as MNOs, IDA would like to explore other policy options in facilitating greater competition in the mobile market,\" it said in its consultation paper yesterday.\n\nYesterday, M1 pronounced itself \"supportive\" of MVNOs, itself selling airtime wholesale to two of them - PLDT and another player called Ztar.\n\nStarHub, on the other hand, noted: \"The Singapore mobile market is already very competitive, with one of the world's highest mobile penetration rates.\"\n\nThe MVNO concept is not new - one of the earlier incarnations here, Virgin Mobile, folded in 2002 less than a year after its debut, blaming a market that was \"too saturated\". Even so, that happened in a pre-3G era and IDA's paper noted that in some countries, MVNOs have grown to account for more than 10 per cent of mobile market share.\n\nOn the spectrum front, the regulator is also contemplating allocating up to 450 Megahertz of spectrum for mobile broadband. Its consultation paper now seeks industry views on how specific spectrum bands should be used and when the \"allocation exercise\" should take place.\n\nThe time division duplex (TDD) bands, in particular, are suitable for the deployment of small cells as a part of a heterogeneous network (HetNet), IDA noted in the paper. Singapore is exploring the idea of putting in place a nationwide HetNet which allows users to switch seamlessly between different networks. A pilot project is anticipated early next year.\n\nWhile SingTel said that it was \"keenly interested\" in developing HetNet, it also said: \"There are many technical specifications we need to consider that can determine the way existing terrestrial mobile networks and new technologies like HetNet interoperate. It is necessary to evaluate the technologies and ensure they are technically and commercially viable before adopting them.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It therefore comes as no surprise to learn that the Republic is the ultra-luxury brand's third biggest market globally for customised cars.\n\nThis was revealed at its $1-million exhibition at Gardens by the Bay, where Rolls-Royce is showcasing its brand, design, craftsmanship and bespoke services to the public here for the first time today.\n\nWith new products like the sportier Wraith coupe and Ghost saloon, Rolls-Royce believes this is the correct time to connect with a new and younger audience.\n\n\"We want to broaden the reach of Rolls-Royce,\" explains Paul Harris, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars regional director for Asia Pacific. \"We will always remain exclusive but we are not untouchable.\"\n\nCalled the Icon Tour, it features artisans flown in from the Goodwood factory to demonstrate their skill in creating the paint, wood and leather finishes for a Rolls-Royce automobile.\n\n\"These will allow an understanding of the car and why it costs more,\" says Mr Harris. With so much expertise in embroidery, wood trim and coachlines, Rolls-Royce caters to those buyers who want their cars to be extra special. And they are the overwhelming majority.\n\nMr Harris adds that 90 to 95 per cent of all their cars sold are bespoke. \"Personalisation is absolutely critical for our clients.\"\n\nAbu Dhabi is the company's top market for bespoke cars, followed by Australia.\n\nFor the Singaporean owner's Phantom EWB, a UK-based jeweller supplied the 446 diamonds that were inlaid in the veneers of the partition wall. Rolls-Royce declined to reveal the final price tag but a standard Phantom EWB ranges from $2.1 million to $2.5 million here.\n\nAlso being unveiled at the Icon Tour is the Ghost V-Specification, a limited series of Ghost and Ghost Extended Wheelbase saloons. With 593 hp - up 30 hp - the V-Spec is the most powerful four-door Rolls-Royce. It is available with five special exterior colours, 21-inch part-polished wheels and an exclusively designed clock, among other details.\n\nThe Icon Tour, which opened yesterday for VIP guests and ends after today's public exhibition, will move on to Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Not surprisingly, JES shares surged to a high of 20 cents following that announcement. Similarly, the value of Scibois' forestry asset is estimated to be more than US$3 billion.\n\nWhether in mining or forestry, JES has been on a frantic lookout for a lifeline to pull it out of its precarious financial state. Its losses had widened to 552.2 million yuan for 2013, from 112.3 million yuan for 2012. Its current liabilities have dwarfed current assets - one of a few concerns that its auditor flagged when it recently raised an alarm over the firm's ability to continue.\n\nThe real question then is: will Scibois be able to bring JES out of the woods?\n\nThe venture into a new country and industry undoubtedly brings with it certain risks.\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo, though now at peace after a long civil war, is still troubled by sporadic outbursts of violence. The government signed a peace deal with a rebel movement in the eastern part of the country only about four months ago.\n\nThe security of the concession licence and the environmental and social impact that comes with harvesting timber are also concerns.\n\nThe forestry sector in Congo - home to the world's second-largest rainforest after the Amazon - has attracted the scrutiny of both governmental and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) looking to eradicate the rampant illegal logging that has taken root there.\n\nAccusations by NGOs are no trifling matters. In 2007, environmental campaign group Greenpeace accused Olam International - which then held 130,300 hectares of forestry concessions in Congo - of sourcing timber from \"destructive and illegal\" operations through subcontracting agreements with third-party suppliers.\n\nThough the company denied any wrongdoing on the concessions which it held for two years, the International Finance Corporation, the private financing arm of the World Bank, subsequently said that it would drop its 3.4 per cent stake in the company.\n\nFor now, JES is aware that investor confidence in the latest deal might have been affected by its change of mind in Mineriver. To allay such doubts, JES has said that it would try to close the Scibois deal as soon as possible.\n\nJES chief financial offer Patrick Kan explained that Scibois is a more advantageous investment for the company, given that it is already operational, and could contribute to JES's bottom line as early as the current financial year.\n\nMineriver, on the other hand, has only exploration rights, thus raising questions about if and when it might turn profitable.\n\nFurthermore, the Scibois investment is more complementary to JES's business. If JES is able to help Scibois build its logistics chain through its shipping expertise, it would also enable it to scale up its logging business, said Mr Kan.\n\nWhile the Scibois deal does look good on paper, it also comes with many attendant risks. In short, this new investment will be no panacea for JES's troubles, which have been building up over several years.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The number of passengers handled was nearly flat at 10.53 million. However, gross and unit meals produced fell 8.2 per cent and 6.3 per cent respectively, as a result of Australia's Qantas Airways moving its hub for its European flights from Changi Airport to the Middle East.

However, foreigners' share of transactions edged up because of a sharper pullback by Singaporean buyers.\n\nSingaporeans' share - at 70 per cent - is at its lowest since the introduction of the additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) in Q4 2011. In absolute terms, purchases by permanent residents (PRs) and foreign buyers were also at their lowest levels since the Q1 2009 market trough during the global financial crisis.\n\nBased on DTZ's caveats analysis of URA Realis data as at April 15, Singaporean buyers accounted for 70 per cent of the 2,076 private homes that changed hands in Q1 this year, down from the 73 per cent share in both Q4 and Q1 last year.\n\nPRs saw their share increase to a record 19 per cent - the highest level since Q1 1995, the earliest date that the URA Realis caveats database goes back to - from 16 per cent in Q4 2013 and 17 per cent in Q1 2013.\n\nMarket watchers linked the rise to the rule change in late-August 2013 requiring new PRs to wait three years before they can buy an HDB resale flat, prompting those who need immediate accommodation to turn to the private housing market.\n\nForeigners' share too has been creeping back up, touching 10 per cent for the first quarter. Although this is still low compared to the pre-ABSD proportion of 19 per cent, this was higher than the 9 per cent in Q4 2013.\n\nDTZ South-east Asia chief operating officer Ong Choon Fah said that given the high home ownership rate among Singaporeans, \"there is no real push factor for them to buy right now\".\n\n\"They can afford to time the market. With signs now that the market is softening, more Singaporeans are taking a wait-and-see attitude.\"\n\nLee Lay Keng, DTZ's regional head (SEA) research, noted that the combination of the ABSD measures and last June's total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework had led to a sharper pullback in buying activity by Singaporeans in the first quarter amid expectations that prices could fall further given that the government has said it is not yet time to remove any cooling measures.\n\nDespite the slowly rising share of foreign buying, market watchers are not expecting the authorities to come up with fresh cooling measures given the weaker property market sentiment.\n\nMs Lee said while the 42 and 47 per cent quarter-on-quarter declines in Q1 purchases by PRs and foreigners respectively were smaller than the 54 per cent slide in Singaporean purchases, the 401 units and 203 units that PRs and foreigners acquired here in January-March were at their lowest levels since Q1 2009. In that quarter, the figures were 325 and 175 units respectively.\n\nThe 1,453 private homes that Singaporeans bought in Q1 this year was the lowest since the 1,402 units in Q4 2008.\n\nFor all three groups, the number of units bought in Q1 was also down significantly from the year-ago period. In Q1 2013, Singaporeans, PRs and foreigners snapped up 4,494, 1,029 and 622 units respectively.\n\nGiving a breakdown of the combined PR and foreign buying pool by nationalities, DTZ said that mainland Chinese, Malaysians, Indonesians and Indians continued to be the top four groups. Together, they accounted for 81 per cent of all private home purchases by non-Singaporean buyers, similar to Q4 2013.\n\nPurchases by all four nationalities saw quarter-on-quarter declines, with Indonesians posting the biggest drop of 52 per cent to only 72 units in Q1. This was the first time since Q1 2009 that their purchases dipped below 100 units.\n\nIn all, 2,076 private homes were transacted in Q1, nearly half the 4,312 units in the previous quarter and one-third the Q1 2013 volume of 6,175 homes. The latest figure marks the first time the number has slipped below 3,000 units since Q4 2008, when 1,787 private home changed hands.\n\nCentury 21 Singapore CEO Ku Swee Yong is cautious about the outlook for private residential transactions for the rest of the year. \"The general mood among real estate investors in most markets is just not there. For Singapore, I'm cautious till at least end-2014. If we see another three to four quarters of subdued transaction volumes and price declines, the Singapore authorities may lift some of the cooling measures. That could bring back buyers.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A score of above 50 indicates that firms have a positive outlook.\n\nHiring expectations, one of the components of the index, inched down 0.25 of a point to 5.30 from 5.55 previously. Turnover expectations fell to 5.59 from 5.68, and profitability expectations fell to 5.40 from 5.48.\n\nBoth turnover and profitability expectation indices posted gains in the first quarter this year.\n\nOf the five industries tracked - business services, commerce/trading, construction/engineering, manufacturing and transport/storage - the latter two were more optimistic about their overall performance in the next six months.\n\nThey were also the only two sectors which are more positive about their turnover and profits. The turnover score for the manufacturing sector rose from 5.55 to 5.62, while the profitability score increased from 5.32 to 5.45. For transport/storage, the turnover score increased from 5.47 to 5.51 and the profitability score rose from 5.36 to 5.43.\n\n\"Singapore is one of the most open economies in the world, so our SMEs will benefit as trade growth picks up this year and during 2015,\" said Chen Yew Nah, managing director of DP Info.\n\nThe World Trade Organization has predicted that trade growth would rise 4.7 per cent next year and 5.3 per cent in 2015.\n\nWhile SMEs in the commerce/trading sector had the highest overall index score, their level of optimism dipped from the last quarter. This may reflect the impact of the stronger Singapore dollar, which hit a three-month high at the end of March.\n\nHo Meng Kit, SBF chief executive, said that domestic-oriented sectors such as the business/services and construction/engineering industries were still hampered by ongoing economic restructuring and the manpower crunch.\n\n\"We urge SMEs to make a concerted effort to pursue growth by tapping the recent Budget measures which provide support for innovation, financing, and internationalisation.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Grand Banks would not disclose the price Mr Loh paid but a similar yacht on display at the show had a price tag of US$1.73 million.\n\nIn the last two months, Grand Banks has signed deals with customers from Japan and Singapore and the company may yet confirm more purchases from the \"shows of interest\" it received at the yacht show, indicating perhaps better times for the luxury yacht maker.\n\nThe Singapore Exchange-listed company is charting its way out of some choppy waters after it was placed on the SGX watchlist in December 2011 following a series of losses.\n\nIt just acquired an Australian yacht maker, months after it announced its first quarterly profit since 2009.\n\nGrand Banks' yachts typically range from 43 to 76 feet and are priced between US$800,000 and US$4.5 million, depending on the configuration and destination of the vessel.\n\nThe yacht ordered by Mr Loh will be constructed at Grand Banks' factory in Johor, and is expected to be delivered later this year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's been there for the last 12 years (since 2002), and we have mutually gained,\" he told reporters shortly after the bank made the sponsorship announcement.\n\nThe hour-long event was held at its office at the Marina Bay Financial Centre in the presence of several VIPs including Acting Manpower Minister Tan Chuan-Jin.\n\n\"It is important that we do review (the sponsorship) from time to time, and we have to look at it. It's a large commercial amount that we are talking about,\" said Mr Swaroop.\n\nThe Singapore Marathon is one of 10 marathons that StanChart sponsors around the world. At the most recent race in Singapore last December, more than 54,000 people took part, including more than 2,000 of the bank's staff.\n\n\"We believe that the marathon, as a property for us, for our brand, is very well associated with what (we) believe in - here for good, for the long run, staying the distance, having a can-do spirit, maintaining stamina, and so on,\" he added.\n\nLim Teck Yin, CEO of Sport Singapore, hailed StanChart's support for the Singapore Marathon as \"phenomenal\".\n\n\"The bank is fully behind the idea that all of us can live better through sport. The Standard Chartered Singapore Marathon has grown from a niche sporting event for marathon runners, into the people's race,\" said Mr Lim.\n\nThe Singapore Marathon has been certified as a \"Gold Label\" road race since 2011, the highest honour awarded by the Monaco-based International Association of Athletics Federations. Among other elite races that have the coveted gold status are the Boston and London marathons.\n\nPublic registration for this year's StanChart marathon, which will take place on the morning of Dec 7, is expected to open in July.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Yesterday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the government would need to pay more attention to downside risks such as China's slowdown.\n\nTrade between Japan and China continued to expand in the year to March 31, despite serious disputes over territory and other issues between the two countries. But as reported yesterday in The Business Times, Japan's business investments in China have been badly hit by the disputes. China has seized a ship owned by Japanese shipping firm Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd for allegedly failing to pay compensation stemming from a wartime contractual obligation, Reuters reported.\n\n\"Japan's (overall) trade balance will continue to be in deficit, but the deficit should decline gradually over coming months,\" a senior IMF official told BT in Tokyo yesterday.\n\nHe pointed to the \"huge increase\" in Japanese imports in Q1 this year as consumer demand rose in anticipation of the April 1 hike in the national consumption tax as a factor contributing to the sharp jump in the trade deficit.\n\nThe import bill has also surged on the back of soaring imports of natural gas and oil to compensate for the 50 nuclear power-generating reactors which have been idled after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that provoked a meltdown at the Fukushima plant.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe's administration is eager to bring at least some of those reactors back on stream in coming months and that should help rescue the overall cost of fuel imports and aid the trade balance in the process, analysts said.\n\nNevertheless, the basic concern is that \"net exports\" are not increasing fast enough to compensate for the sharpness of the increase in import costs. As a result, Japan is not fully benefiting from the \"J-curve\" effect of a depreciating currency, said the IMF official.\n\nJapan is losing its international competitiveness and the government should take necessary steps \"soon\" to \"foster industries that have export competitiveness\", Junko Shimizu, a professor at Gakkushuin University, and Yokohama National University professor Kiyotaka Sato said in a report quoted by Kyodo news service.\n\nIn fiscal 2013, exports to China climbed 14.6 per cent to 13.01 trillion yen, while imports from China were up 21 per cent at a record 18.58 trillion yen, bringing the trade deficit to a record 5.57 trillion yen, Kyodo said.\n\nShipments to the United States increased 15.9 per cent to 13.21 trillion yen and imports rose 16.8 per cent to 7.14 trillion yen. Japan posted a trade surplus of 6.07 trillion yen with the US, up 14.8 per cent from a year earlier.\n\nExports to the European Union grew 13.2 per cent to 7.24 trillion yen, while imports rose 16.7 per cent to 7.96 trillion yen. The trade balance with the region marked its biggest deficit of 719.2 billion yen.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He identified them as two first-ranked officers, Kang and Shin, one second-ranked officer named Kim and an engineer named Park.\n\nThe captain and two other crew members have already been arrested and face charges including accidental homicide.\n\nThe inquiry intensified as divers continued to search the submerged ship in the hope of finding survivors trapped in air pockets.\n\nMore guide lines have been snaked into the ferry to aid in the search, and rescuers were expecting to reach the vessel's dining hall, where survivors say many passengers were at the time of the incident, at about 12pm local time.\n\nMore bodies were found yesterday morning, bringing the total recovered to 64, Ko Myung Suk, director general of the equipment and technology bureau at the Korea Coast Guard, said at a press briefing in Jindo. Rescuers saved 174 people as the boat sank. The largest group of passengers was the 339 Danwon High School students and their teachers on an excursion to Jeju island. Medical staff on Jindo island, where families of missing passengers assembled, were collecting DNA samples to help with identification of the dead.\n\nThe ferry's third mate, surnamed Park, was arrested on April 19 along with the captain and a helmsman. She hasn't given a clear answer as to why the ship veered so sharply, prosecutor Yang Joong Jin told reporters on Sunday in Mokpo.\n\nIt was Park's first time trying to steer the ship through a waterway known for rough currents, investigators have said.\n\nCaptain Lee Joon Seok, 68, who wasn't on the bridge at the time of the incident, appears to have escaped before the passengers, while investigators need more information about where other crew members were at the time of the incident, prosecutor Ahn said.\n\nProsecutors earlier said Lee was 69 based on a Korean tradition of including the year before birth in calculating ages. He was born in November 1945, according to records released by the hospital.\n\nPark and a helmsman named Cho, who was on the bridge with her, face three charges, including accidental homicide and violation of maritime laws. The pair's comments on the ferry's sudden turn don't match, Mr Ahn said, without elaborating.\n\nInvestigators have focused on the crew members' actions up to the incident, with less attention so far given to what they did afterward, Mr Yang said on Sunday.\n\nThe joint coast guard and prosecution team is still analysing phone messages sent by people on the vessel including messages sent on Kakao Corp's KakaoTalk application, Mr Ahn said yesterday. The investigation also includes the communications made between crew members via walkie-talkie, he added.\n\nThe coast guard raided the office of the ferry's owner, Chonghaejin Marine Co, in Incheon on April 17.\n\nKim Han Shik, the chief executive officer of Chonghaejin Marine, said his company had committed a \"terrible sin\". Mr Kim was speaking at a press briefing at Incheon port on April 17 that was broadcast on MBN TV.\n\nInvestigators are also looking into modifications made to expand passenger and cargo capacity on the 20-year-old ship. The ferry will need to be raised before investigators can assess whether it had any defects, Mr Ahn said.\n\nThe Sewol passed safety inspections for the expansion work at a check between October 2012 and February 2013, said an official from the Korean Register of Shipping, which conducted the test. The official asked not to be identified, citing company policy.\n\nChonghaejin Marine had modified the vessel to carry an additional 117 passengers, expanding the total capacity including crew to 956 people, the Korean Register official said.\n\nInvestigators are planning to summon about 20 officials from Chonghaejin Marine and the company which did the expansion work for questioning, Mr Ahn said, without naming the company.\n\nThe vessel was built by Japan's Hayashikane Dockyard Co in 1994 and had no accidents during 18 years of operation in Japan, according to Takaharu Miyazono, a spokesman for A-Line, the previous owner. It sold the ferry to the Korean company in October 2012, Mr Miyazono added. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

This comes after a memorandum of understanding on the RTO was signed on Feb 24.\n\nThe sellers will inject the entire paid-up capital of Straits Construction into Transcu by buying new shares in Transcu at 50 cents each - the minimum issue price under listing rules. The shares will represent not less than 79.89 per cent of the enlarged share capital of Transcu.\n\nThe total purchase amount will be between $325 million and $338 million, provided that the consolidated net profit after tax of Straits Construction for end-2013 is not less than $42 million.\n\nKoo Ah Seang, Transcu's executive chairman, said in a statement that Straits Construction has an established business and will give Transcu a new lease of life.\n\nStraits Construction has been in Singapore since the 1960s. The company builds public housing projects, private residential projects and commercial developments. It has also expanded to China, where it is in a joint venture to develop a piece of land to build private residential apartments, a golf and country club, commercial areas and a five-star hotel.\n\nUnaudited results for Straits Construction's 2013 financial year show a net profit of $42.1 million, down from $49.7 million in 2012. Revenue was $434 million in 2013, up from $417 million in 2012.\n\nA series of corporate actions will take place before Transcu's deal is completed. They include a share consolidation, a rights and warrants issue, an equity-linked notes subscription agreement and a scheme of arrangement with creditors.\n\nAfter the completion of the proposed acquisition, Transcu will have an estimated 20.4 billion shares with a share capital of $1 billion. The deadline for the proposed acquisition is Dec 31, 2014.\n\nTranscu entered the Singapore Exchange watchlist last December after making three consecutive years of losses and having its market capitalisation fall below $40 million.\n\nFormed from a reverse takeover of cinema operator Eng Wah at the end of 2008, the company is a Japanese firm that sells cosmetics and has a pharmaceutical segment that develops methods to deliver drugs through the skin. It also had a segment looking at renewable energy products.\n\nBut the company ran into cash-flow problems. Commercialising its pharmaceutical and green technology business needed more time and funds.\n\nIts green energy unit, Biomass Energy Corporation, issued shares last October, resulting in a dilution of Transcu's stake in it to below 50 per cent.\n\nThe same month, Transcu said it was exploring the partial or full sale of its pharmaceutical and cosmetic businesses.\n\nYesterday, Transcu said it had entered into agreements to dispose of subsidiaries TTI Ellebeau and Dharma Therapeutics for one yen (S$0.012) each.\n\nBoth had negative net asset values as at end-2013. The disposal is expected to have a positive effect on Transcu's net tangible assets per share and earnings per share.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A lot of those would be for China,\" said David Velupillai, marketing director for Airbus Corporate Jets (ACJ).\n\nToday, about 25 of the 170 or so Airbus corporate jets which have been sold so far are based in the region. Twenty of those are in China alone.\n\nACJ is the business jet unit of aircraft manufacturer Airbus, which is more popularly known for commercial aircraft - such as the double-decker A380 - used by airlines globally.\n\n\"China has the highest GDP growth. It's a relatively new market for corporate jets so we see China . . . as the fastest-growing market at the moment for business jets,\" he added.\n\nAccording to a study conducted by UK-based Ledbury Research together with Airbus, the number of billionaires in China is expected to more than double from 470 in 2012 to about 1,040 in 2017. This would put the populous nation on a par with the US in terms of the number of billionaires by 2017.\n\nWorldwide, ACJ is keen to sell a total of 15 business jets a year, with the remaining aircraft likely to go to markets such as the Middle East, North America, Europe and Africa. Buyers tend to be high net worth individuals, governments as well as companies.\n\nThe European plane-maker delivered about six corporate jets last year as the uncertain global economy hit demand.\n\n\"The last few years have been challenging for everybody,\" said Mr Velupillai.\n\nLast week, the plane-maker announced that it was launching a new, simplified version of its most popular make of corporate jet dubbed the ACJ319 Elegance, which Mr Velupillai reckons could be of interest to the Chinese market. Elegance is priced under US$80 million, while the ACJ319 typically goes for around US$87 million.\n\nUnlike the current fully customisable version, Elegance will offer a range of lounge, office, dining and conference modules for customers to choose from, which will allow them to save time and effort in designing the cabin, Airbus said.\n\nDown the line, it will also make upgrading the cabin easier by allowing the existing modules to be replaced by different ones.\n\nCabin outfitting of the Elegance model will be carried out by its Airbus Corporate Jet Centre subsidiary in Toulouse. Manufacturing of its ACJ318 and ACJ319 corporate jets are mostly done in Hamburg.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Year-on-year comparisons against pro-forma figures prior to listing are not meaningful because MGCCT only acquired its key assets at listing.\n\nHong Kong retail mall Festival Walk, which suffered damage to its rainwater discharge pipes and flooding in March because of a thunderstorm, currently has 100 per cent retail and office occupancy, with shopper traffic rising 5.8 per cent and tenant sales growing 4.7 per cent over the past year, MGCCT said.\n\nAll retail leases at Festival Walk expiring between fiscal 2013 and 2014 have been renewed or re-let at rents that are almost 20 per cent higher.\n\nBeijing office building Gateway Plaza had 97.5 per cent recorded occupancy as at March 31, with renewals and re-lets for leases expiring in fiscal 2013 and 2014 enjoying 79 per cent higher rents.\n\nCiting expectations for steady growth in Hong Kong's economy in 2014, MGCCT expects firm domestic demand and rising visitor arrivals to maintain the growth momentum in Hong Kong's retail market.\n\nThe company expects a more balanced and sustainable pace of growth in China in the year ahead.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The total number of people receiving benefits fell by 11,000 to 2.74 million in the week ended April 5, the fewest since December 2007, the Labour Department's report showed.\n\nBut momentum may be fading in other parts of the economy. The housing market recovery has been challenged by higher interest rates, slow wage growth and tight credit, which have put home ownership out of reach for some would-be buyers.- Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

In the run-up to the nationwide parliamentary elections, the Sensex has pushed into record territory.\n\nBut, to keep the market trending higher, this vote, heralded for its sheer size, will have to channel its enormity into a strong mandate for the winning party or major coalition, in our view. Such results could signal a sea change for India's economy, which has struggled with stagflationary conditions in the last few years despite favourable demographics and significant potential for catch-up growth - suggesting that the impediments are largely cyclical.\n\nDeterioration in productivity growth, prompted by inept policy choices - for example, maintaining a high fiscal deficit, advocating high rural wage growth, creating an unfavourable business climate through general policy uncertainty amid weak external demand - fostered the sluggishness. Weaker economic growth and slower job creation have resulted, attended by elevated inflation, which has eroded purchasing power and likely raised income inequality.\n\nWe see five key reforms that could re-ignite the country's economy, pushing it toward sustainable 7 to 8 per cent growth in gross domestic product (GDP):\n\nRecognising that the likelihood and speed of implementing and reaching such objectives rises as fragmentation in government falls, we have quantified distinct growth outcomes under four election result scenarios:\n\n1. An absolute majority (260+ seats) for the winning party;\n\n2. 220-230 seats for one of the two major coalitions;\n\n3. A more fragmented coalition with the lead party winning about 180 seats; and\n\n4. A broad fragmented coalition with participation of a lead party only in a supporting role.\n\nWe think Scenario 1 could accelerate fiscal 2016 GDP growth to 6.5-7.25 per cent and raise market earnings growth to 25 per cent, but Scenario 4 could cut these respective figures to 5.0-5.5 per cent and 5.0 per cent.\n\nThe markets appear to be discounting an election result that lies between Scenarios 1 and 2.\n\nThe earnings yield gap of the MSCI India, a free-float adjusted market capitalisation weighted index, suggests that the market believes a new growth cycle is imminent. But, as noted, it believes that such a growth cycle hinges on a decisive election outcome.\n\nStill, India has witnessed strong inflows from foreign institutional investors, in contrast to outflows for emerging markets; the average breakdown by sector for institutional portfolios suggests that investors have positioned themselves for a cyclical recovery, as they are overweight financials, industrials and consumer discretionary and underweight technology and healthcare.\n\nAlso, investment styles have shifted from quality to beta, financial leverage, and capex - all high-risk factors.\n\nOverall, India's relative performance to emerging markets has climbed in recent weeks, together with a fall in trailing value-at-risk and low implied volatility; all this suggests growing confidence about the election results as well as a subsequent recovery in growth.\n\nIf the elections are decisive, utilities, state-owned banks, energy, industrials and materials could gain the most. Credit spreads would likely tighten on the potential for state-owned bank recapitalisation, a better balance of payments in India's international accounts and a more stable sovereign ratings outlook. The Indian rupee could appreciate another 7-8 per cent against the US dollar, we estimate.\n\nIf the elections produce a fragmented coalition, the equity market could revert to quality stocks; in this scenario, technology and pharmaceuticals could be the major outperformers, and the rupee could lose more than 10 per cent.\n\nFrom a portfolio perspective, we believe investors should own a mix of stocks with global exposure and local cyclical businesses, those with a growth-at-a-reasonable-price orientation and some stocks in industries that could benefit from post-election policy action (such as energy).\n\nSuch an approach could insulate a portfolio against a fall in risk-adjusted performance, though it may not guarantee outperformance in the case of extreme electoral outcomes.\n\nThe writer is the chief India equity strategist with Morgan Stanley\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But if he beat it, they would pay him a fee equal to one-third of the money they had made beyond what the index had returned.\n\nThis was not how things were typically done. Managers of mutual funds would take, say, 1 per cent of all of the assets each year whether they beat the market or not. Hedge fund managers might help themselves to 2 per cent of the entire pile of money to compensate them for their valuable time, in addition to 20 per cent of any winnings beyond a particular benchmark, like the S&P 500.\n\nBut at the age of 30, Mr Kurtz could afford to take a flier, and in six of the next eight years, he managed to make money through his arrangement. Thanks in part to timely picks on Amazon and the Apollo Education Group, he even managed to buy a nice house for his family in a bucolic New Jersey town. There, he watched the markets on his computer screen while stealing glances out the window at the bears that would occasionally wander by.\n\nDespite all that success, he recently sent me a searing email with the subject heading \"My Capitulation.\" In it, he described his conversion from a stock-picker to someone who mostly buys index and exchange-traded funds for his clients. And his story is our story, or at least it should be.\n\nLike many market obsessives, Mr Kurtz began his journey with baseball. He didn't play, but he loved to trade cards, and by his teenage years, he was renting tables at shows and hoarding Ken Griffey Jr rookie cards. Around that time, he took note of the stock pages in his father's copy of The Wall Street Journal, filing away the fact that the 52-week highs and lows of a single security were often very far apart.\n\nIt all clicked into place for him after college, when he started reading books about the stock market and could not stop. He enrolled at Columbia Business School, one of the best training grounds for professional investors. Then he landed at a Bear Stearns mutual fund, where his colleagues took it for granted that above-average people could deliver above-average returns and that they were all way above average.\n\nMr Kurtz soon recognised their collective folly. While at Columbia, Warren Buffett had come to speak and told the students that he had only one or two truly great investment ideas each year. \"But the average mutual fund had 80 great ideas for you to buy today,\" Mr Kurtz said this week, mimicking the carnival barker-like message that his and other funds projected, given that many of them had at least several dozen holdings. \"The whole industry is a joke. You can't have that many good ideas at one time.\"\n\nSo he started his own firm, which I wrote about in a column in The Wall Street Journal in 2006. He kept all of his clients' money in an S&P 500 exchange-traded fund, and when he had conviction about a particular stock, he would move 3 to 6 per cent of the money into that security. He generally had about 25 per cent of the money in individual stocks, given that he, too, never had more than a handful of great ideas at any given time.\n\nHe never managed to completely replace his Bear Stearns salary from his business, though he didn't starve, either. As the years passed, however, several other problems emerged. Because he was investing only in large US stocks, potential investors had to be willing to carve out a chunk of their investable assets and hand them over to him. Plenty of people didn't want the hassle of having multiple advisers in their lives, with Mr Kurtz handling their big US stocks and someone else overseeing their bonds and other investments.\n\nThen there was a tax problem. Using the most conservative assumptions about tax rates and holding periods, his investors might end up paying 35 per cent of their gains to the federal government. That cut into returns.\n\nThe third thing that gnawed at Mr Kurtz's conscience, however, was the glimpse he got of his customers' portfolios when they first came to see him. Many had little exposure to investments outside the United States, or they had bond allocations made up of four collections of junk bonds. Nobody was doing it right, and his stock-picking shop was not set up to help them.\n\nThis sort of realisation is familiar to the executives who run Dimensional Fund Advisors, a mutual fund company where the managers do not try to pick stocks or predict what direction the overall markets are heading. Each year, the company hears from dozens of investment advisers just like Mr Kurtz who are in the middle of their own reckoning about how they want to do business.\n\nDave Butler, the company's head of global financial adviser services, experienced it himself as a young Merrill Lynch employee. He had a lot of success picking stocks, but then he bought shares of Boston Chicken for about US$16 each. \"This was before you could check stock prices on your phone, so I opened the newspaper on a business trip one day and it said something like seven and three-quarters,\" he recalled. \"I pushed at the paper, thinking there was a crease in there.\" There was no crease, and not long after, he decamped for Dimensional and has been there ever since.\n\nMr Kurtz decided to follow a similar path away from stock-picking, even though he had a pretty good track record. One thing that helped clinch the need for change was the fact that he could not promise with a straight face that his performance would continue.\n\nSo now Mr Kurtz intends to put most of his clients' money in index and exchange-traded funds, though he currently favours active management for international bonds and does sometimes shift his portfolios to favour certain asset classes. (He is not an investor in Dimensional's mutual funds.) His fees range from 0.50 per cent to 0.95 per cent a year, with a US$950 annual minimum, depending on how much a client invests. He is not a certified financial planner, so for now those fees cover only the investment services at his firm, Core Asset Management.\n\nEven so, he says this is a fair price, even in a world where Vanguard will now run your money and handle your other financial planning needs for 0.3 per cent annually. \"Who are you getting at Vanguard?\" he said. \"I have experience on a US$7 billion mutual fund, an MBA from Columbia and I've spent countless hours figuring out what an optimal portfolio should look like. I'm a Wall Street guy you'd get at Goldman Sachs but at half the price.\"\n\nYes, life would be easier if we could all still rely on pension fund managers to hand us guaranteed payouts from the day we retire until the day we die. Most of us don't live in that world anymore, however, and we are in charge of our retirement investments. Taking gonzo risks on individual stocks or specialised funds just isn't prudent anymore.\n\nAnd now Mr Kurtz, trader of baseball cards and Amazon shares, knows it too. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": []}

They're consulting with academic economists and psychologists, while also using rigorous testing and creative design to make sure their ideas work in the real world.\n\nHere's a look at these startups' attempts to alert, nudge and, well, manipulate people into becoming better savers, spenders and investors.\n\nStickK.com\n\nThe website StickK, co-founded by two Yale University professors, is designed for those times when willpower isn't enough to achieve your goals. You might commit on the site to repaying credit card debt, keeping track of your spending or saving money by bringing your lunch to work.\n\nTo add more motivation, you can put money on the line. If you fail, it goes to charity. For even more motivation, you can commit to having it sent to a political organisation you hate. You also can choose a \"referee\" - say, a co-worker who knows your lunch habits - to make the final determination and keep you honest.\n\nWith both money on the line and a referee, StickK.com users achieve three-quarters of their goals, CEO Jordan Goldberg said.\n\nOpower\n\nWhat lowers energy usage? Behavioural research shows appeals to citizenship and the environment and even promises of cost savings fall flat.\n\nPeer pressure, however, works. Opower is a company that uses that insight to redesign electric bills. A typical Opower bill might point out you're using 10 per cent more energy than your neighbours, and offer suggestions for how to lower that.\n\nNow serving more than 90 utilities around the world, Opower says that its personalised messages lower overall energy use one to 3.5 per cent.\n\nLevel Money (US)\n\nThe app Level Money provides a constantly updated view of how much spendable cash you have, after taking into account your savings goals and ongoing bills.\n\nWhile this can help you think twice before making unaffordable impulse buys, it can also give you permission to live a little. Those who are otherwise meeting their financial goals \"don't have to feel guilty\" treating themselves to an expensive dinner, said Level's vice-president of design Robert Suarez.\n\nLift\n\n\"Did you call the cable company yet?\" That's not your spouse or your inner-nag bugging you. That's a notification on your phone from the app Lift. It's based on the idea that committing to a firm goal - in this case, a 10-step plan to \"Save Money: Get Rid of Cable\" - is more effective than vaguely berating yourself every day.\n\nUsers can sign up for dozens of plans, from an 11-step plan to \"stop being a workaholic\" or an 11-step plan for \"how to live a Spartan life\" to non-financial goals such as flossing, dieting and exercise. Users can create their own plans, and cheer each other on. \"It's a more efficient form of coaching,\" co-founder Tony Stubblebine said.\n\nCheck (US)\n\nThe water bill's due, says the alert from the app Check. In fact, it was due three days ago and you ignored earlier alerts. But the app tried again now because it could see that your paycheck just cleared.\n\nBy analysing the behaviour of the 10 million users who aggregate credit card, bank, loans and other accounts with them, Check finds that, even if there's money in their accounts, \"a lot of consumers choose to wait to pay the bill until they get paid,\" vice-president of marketing Daniel Kjellen said.\n\nMint.com (US/Canada)\n\nMost people don't particularly like hearing they're deviants straying from social norms. Mint.com, the online personal finance site, frequently deploys such \"social proof\" - as the behavioural economists call the concept.\n\nThe site might let you know you're paying 167 per cent more for car insurance than people like you typically do, Mint.com's Vince Maniago said. Or, it might point out that if you ate out two fewer times a week - bringing your restaurant visits in line with the average in your area - you could save as much as US$1,000 in six months.\n\nWallet.AI\n\nThe future of financial apps may be in artificial intelligence. Not robots who follow you around and control your spending, but advanced computers that track and analyse the transactions you make throughout your day and make recommendations in real time.\n\nIt might point out your tendency to over-spend in certain restaurants or stores, or notice that your new, pricier yoga studio is derailing your dream of a vacation in Bali.\n\nOmar Green, founder of Wallet.AI, a startup developing such a tool, said that the goal is an app that makes thousands of calculations about your financial life - \"more math than any person would want to do\". The result, he said, should insulate you from temptation by keeping your eyes on long-term goals. As long as your phone battery lasts, anyway.\n\nLearnVest\n\nOnline financial adviser LearnVest often calls itself the \"Weight Watchers for personal finance\". One thing the startup borrows from the weight loss programme is an emphasis on the boost that comes with small achievements, especially early in the process.\n\nWhile Weight Watchers might instruct members to clean out their refrigerator, LearnVest sometimes advises new clients to clean the unnecessary cards and old receipts out of their wallets. Achieving these \"bite-sized financial to-dos\" provides an important sense of accomplishment, said LearnVest founder Alexa von Tobel.\n\nBetterment\n\nWhen the stock market drops, some investors might need reassuring from their advisers, and others might be better left alone. Online investment manager Betterment tries to distinguish between the two.\n\nIf your past behaviour suggests you're prone to panicking and doing something stupid during market corrections, the startup sends you reassuring messages. But if you're a calmer and less engaged investor, you won't be contacted.\n\n\"By actually bringing this to your attention,\" said Dan Egan, Betterment's director of investing and behavioural finance, \"we might be the ones stressing you out\". - Bloomberg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Unlike external auditors, internal auditors look beyond financial risks and statements to consider wider issues such as the company's reputation, growth, impact on the environment and the way it treats its employees.\n\nBut the function, and expectations, of the role have also evolved. Nagesh Pinge, chief audit executive for Tata Motors, India, said the balance has shifted from internal audit being more about providing assurance and satisfying regulatory compliance requirements to about achieving greater business insights.\n\n\"Internal audit now has become more collaborative than before. There is no more 'You' and 'I' and finger-pointing. Internal audit takes up coaching responsibility for the business, driving performance improvement initiatives and closing internal control gaps,\" he said.\n\nThose internal audit functions that rise to meet such growing expectations within their organisations are seen as adding great value to their companies.\n\nPwC found that, when a company has broad expectations of internal audit - ie, they expect it to be a trusted adviser, rather than just an assurance provider - and the internal audit function has also invested in the right capabilities to deliver on these expectations, the performance of internal audit is typically rated much higher.\n\nFor example, 67 per cent of stakeholders surveyed said that the internal audit function adds significant value when it is seen as a trusted adviser, whereas just 33 per cent feel it adds significant value when it is seen as just an assurance provider.\n\nMelvin Flowers, corporate vice-president of Internal Audit at Microsoft, USA, put it this way: \"Internal audit needs to be able to be in the business conversation and show they understand the business objectives. Internal audit won't have a seat at the table if they don't understand the business and have credibility in the management's eyes.\n\n\"We used to hire the best accountants. Now, we need someone that is as good with communication and able to listen, in addition to having good technical knowledge. If internal audit thinks their job starts with the balance sheet, they are going to be wrong. Their job starts with the business objectives and where the company is going. If they focus on the business objectives, they will be aligned to the critical risks of the organisation,\" he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Founded in February, it has sought regulatory approval for its new fund, which would target institutional investors and pension funds in the US, the UK, and the Middle East. \"The best deal in any country, always, is going to be the off-market deal,\" Mr Chen said in an interview at the firm's office in downtown Beijing. \"You have to explore the relationship, you have to explore the off-market opportunity.\"\n\nThis was especially important as deals were often sealed behind the scenes, even at open auctions, he said. For instance, at a recent auction for a plot of land in the southern city of Ningbo, the winning bid went to a firm that promised the local government it would move its headquarters to the city, thereby lifting future employment and tax revenues. \"So if you just go there and say 'OK, this is open price, so I'm going to put in my bid because I have capital', then you are just too naive.\"\n\nDirect foreign investment in property is strictly controlled by the government, which fears excessive speculation in the market. Therefore, although foreign investment in property is on the rise, it accounts for only a fraction of total spending.\n\nChina has always stood out among investors as a compelling market for buying bad loans and distressed assets, but never lived up to its potential. An attempt to launch a market for distressed assets quickly shrivelled in the mid-2000s.\n\nForeign investors said that the market died because auctions were rigged, laws were opaque, and governments resisted corporate bankruptcies. In response, Chinese authorities said that foreigners were trying to buy assets at unreasonably low prices.\n\nMr Chen said that the market is now more transparent, but investors still need to be mindful of social and political sensitivities when negotiating with governments about company closures.\n\nAs a unit of China Orient Asset Management Corp, one of four bad-debt banks created by Beijing to clean up the biggest Chinese banks which were technically insolvent in the late 1990s, China Orient Summit has the advantage of state backing.\n\nBeijing Wutong Summit Investment Managing Centre owns the remaining 20 per cent of China Orient Summit.\n\nChina Orient Asset Management Corp can invest up to 20 per cent of the new distressed fund.\n\nAs China's leaders slow growth rates down so they can overhaul the economy to make it more driven by consumption and less by investment, financial stress is clearly building.\n\nMedia reported last week that Nanjing Fudi Real Estate Development Co Ltd missed repayments on a 900 million yuan (S$181 million) loan borrowed from a ship builder, becoming the latest in a string of corporate credit defaults.\n\nData last Friday showed China's home price inflation slowed to an eight-month low in March, and analysts expect the easing trend to continue.\n\nMr Chen said that some cities, including Wenzhou and Ordos, are burdened by an excess supply of homes and high prices, but declined to name other cities where distress levels are rising.\n\nWenzhou, a centre for private businesses, is the only city in China where official data shows house prices are falling. Ordos is a former boomtown for coal miners but now notorious for its empty apartment blocks.\n\nStill, investors who believe China will suffer from a messy bursting of a property bubble are misguided, said Mr Chen. \"I have never believed that there is a property bubble. This country is just way too big,\" he said. \"Easily, if you go inland, if you go west, those cities are far from developed.\" - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

So these are the two real areas and after that we need to have some further discussions to better identify opportunities because we both have ideas but as yet, they are a little premature for us to discuss outside of our own areas,\" he added.\n\nBoth Singapore-listed offshore & marine companies had signed a non-legally binding memorandum of understanding earlier this month. This was to explore and pursue opportunities for collaboration in utilising the capacity of Port Melville to augment Darwin Port with increased regional capacity for oil & gas and resource industries, as well as in the provision of logistics supply chain and related support services in the Darwin Port.\n\nMainboard-listed Ezra also became a substantial shareholder of AusGroup in April after it acquired a 6.9 per cent stake in the Australian company.\n\nHowever, Mr Kenny said the work that both companies will be doing together at the Darwin and Melville ports had yet to be decided. \"That's still to be determined, we have to further discuss and identify.\"\n\nAs preliminary as this partnership may seem at the moment, Mr Kenny is confident that AusGroup has a unique proposition to offer to Ezion, and he feels that may be the main reason the Singapore-based company has invested and wants to partner it.\n\n\"Our competitive advantage is the integrated service line that we have, where one relationship provides many areas of expertise - project management, maintenance, welding (etc) - whether they are onshore or offshore customers, they will require these services at some point in time.\"\n\nHe claimed that none of AusGroup's competitors was able to provide such a wide-ranging offering, and he believes this is what attracted Ezion to it.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The pricing was between $1,380 and $1,600 per square foot (psf).\n\nThe freehold status as well as the smaller scale of the development - which offers a degree of exclusivity vis-a-vis condominiums with hundreds of units - also proved a draw for buyers, added Mr Tan. Smaller units were popular with younger buyers while families opted for bigger ones.\n\nThe five-storey development - offering one- to three-bedroom units ranging from 441 to 1,808 sq ft - is situated on a site of about 78,100 sq ft. The units yet to be sold are said to be largely penthouses.\n\nSimilar five-storey project launches in West Coast/Pasir Panjang last year - such as Icon@Pasir Panjang, Seasuites, Village@Pasir Panjang and Whitehaven - have seen average transacted prices of $1,600 to $1,700 psf.\n\nThe Sorrento is expected to obtain its temporary occupation permit (TOP) in the first quarter of next year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There is nothing sinister going on in terms of food prices in Asia,\" they wrote in a research note on Thursday.\n\nIn addition, price pressures have eased in most Asian markets. Food inflation has largely slowed, except in the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore. But where the CPI is more sensitive to swings in the cost of food, such as India, Indonesia, Vietnam and China, price pressures have dropped, the economists added.\n\nHSBC is also expecting prices for certain agricultural commodities to reach a higher plateau, reflecting structural changes in global supply and demand.\n\nSeparate research by the bank found that consumption of grains is the first to pick up as a developing country becomes richer, but as it reaches middle-income levels, demand shifts to meat, dairy products, sugar and edible oils instead.\n\nWith many countries having exceeded low levels of per capita gross domestic product (GDP), human consumption of grains may have already peaked, the bank said in a report last month.\n\nThere is, however, more room for higher consumption of \"finer foods\".\n\nDemand for these tend to grow until per capita GDP reaches US$20,000 to US$30,000, it said.\n\n\"As per capita GDP in many countries is still below these levels, demand for finer foods is set to rise for many years yet.\"\n\nAs a growing middle class boosts demand for these, HSBC reckons that soft commodity prices might even outperform hard commodities - the main beneficiaries from the industrialisation of emerging economies so far - in coming years.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The 20 trillion rupiah economic loss figure is for Riau alone. The BNPB spent 103 billion rupiah fighting fires in Riau for all of last year.\n\n\"This year has already been a difficult year,\" said Mr Nugroho.\n\nSitting at the intersection of Indonesia's resources and commodities industry, and in close proximity to neighbours such as Singapore, fires in Riau can pack a powerful punch. Hundreds of oil wells were forced to stop production when maintenance workers could not make their way to the installation through the haze. Airports were closed for days and businesses shut down, while palm plantations, which contribute more than 10 per cent of the country's exports, went up in smoke. Tens of thousands fell ill and schools closed as the haze made life miserable for millions.\n\nBy mid-March, just weeks after the rainy season had subsided in the rest of the archipelago, as many fires were tearing through forests and drained wetlands in Riau as they were at the peak of the forest fire season in mid-2013, when the haze cast a pall over relations between Singapore and Indonesia.\n\nWhile most blazes were extinguished with the help of rain by the beginning of April, the agency has set aside 500 billion rupiah to respond to fires between May and August, Mr Nugroho said. \"It may be a busy year,\" he added.\n\nThe prevalence of fires underscores the volatile mix of climate change and unsustainable forest management. Palm and pulp and paper sectors are linked to much of the one million hectares of forests razed every year here, while reforestation is occurring at half that rate, Mr Nugroho noted.\n\nIncompetent local administrations have also hindered the effort to respond to fires and to prevent them. Known as regencies, their incoming administrators tend to change disaster response managers as they would other heads of the bureaucracy.\n\n\"We are petitioning the central government to bring that management under the BNPB,\" Mr Nugroho pointed out.\n\nStill, Riau is particularly vulnerable to forest fires. Home to some of the country's poorest people, fires set by desperate residents, eager to clear forest and wetlands to make room for palm plantations, can easily burn out of control during the dry season.\n\nForest and peat fires, set after wetlands have been drained to make room for crops that can produce incomes for poor families, account for 80 per cent of the country's greenhouse emissions, the Ford Foundation has said.\n\nMore than 3,100 fires have burnt throughout Indonesia so far this year - 87 per cent in Riau, according to data from the World Resources Institute. Half of those are in concessions held by pulpwood, oil palm and logging companies, the body said in a report.\n\nBy 2010, Riau had lost almost 200,000 hectares of its forest cover, more than any other province, according to recent government data.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Dubbed the SingTel Grid Girls, they became a permanent fixture at subsequent editions of the world's only F1 night race.\n\nThis week, Singapore Airlines (SIA) announced it had signed an initial two-year agreement to come onboard as the title sponsor - thus marking the end of SingTel's six-year run - as it seeks to give its brand-name a further boost by hitching its (albeit already sizeable) wagon to the glamorous, high-octane F1 franchise.\n\nThe champagne-sipping, jet-setting crowd which throngs the luxe Paddock Club each race weekend is the perfect audience to promote the premium carrier. SIA has been strengthening its network through code-share agreements and strategic alliances. It is acquiring next-generation aircraft as well as investing in cabin and lounge upgrades to edge out competitors. The converse is equally true for race promoter Singapore GP (SGP), which is working on potential marketing tie-ups with SIA, such as F1 packages - a logical step given SIA's extensive network and client base of affluent travellers.\n\nAnd one could argue that in the kebaya-clad Singapore Girl, SIA has a ready-made Grand Prix mascot - an icon as instantly recognisable as a Starbucks sign to a caffeine-starved hipster. Plus, telling the F1 drivers to fasten their seatbelts would come perfectly naturally to them.\n\nBeaming the Singapore Girl into the living rooms of the nearly 90 million television viewers who tune in every September when the Singapore Grand Prix flags off is great marketing. Rival carriers such as Dubai's Emirates and Abu Dhabi's Etihad have cottoned on to this, having already firmly parked their marketing dollars with Bernie Ecclestone and company.\n\nBut still, perhaps a wardrobe tweak might be in order for race weekend if the SIA Girls were to take their place on the starting grid this September. One wit quipped in an online forum: \"With their tight, long skirts, they will take forever to walk away from the grid after holding their banner/umbrella next to the cars. This will delay the start of the race. Drivers sitting in their cars will be frustrated.\"\n\nAnd while we're at it, why not bring out SIA's male cabin crew and flaunt some Grid Boys too? After all, gender equality is a big thing nowadays and the airline, criticised over the years for typecasting women, now gets a chance to make amends.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Discussions on the ambitious Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) - a mega free trade pact involving 12 Pacific Rim countries including Singapore - have not gone as smoothly as the United States had hoped. The dragged-out negotiations missed a self-imposed end-\n\n2013 deadline and it is still not clear when the talks - the next round will be held in Vietnam next month - can be wrapped up.\n\nAgriculture and the auto sector are the two sensitive areas that have proven to be sticking points between the US and Japan, the world's No 1 and No 3 economies respectively. Washington wants Tokyo to lower its tariff on beef imports as well as ease protective measures that also ring-fence dairy products, pork and rice. Japan, meanwhile, wants the US to drop the tariffs imposed on imported cars and trucks, which the influential US automotive lobby has fiercely opposed. There is, however, a degree of optimism in the air that Mr Obama could make some headway on the TPP during his visit to Japan, his first stop on his swing through the region. Analysts are hopeful of a breakthrough in the TPP talks that would allow the two sides to signal that they have settled at least some of their differences and moved closer to an agreement.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The stock, which had been suspended for a year until Monday, will move to an over-the-counter board for small and medium-size enterprises after 30 trading days, according to the company.\n\n\"The delisting is kind of a warning to investors to keep away from these loss-making companies that don't have restructuring prospects,\" said Wu Kan at Shanghai-based Dragon Life Insurance Co. \"An improvement in the delisting rules may mean the start of expulsions of lots of unqualified companies.\"\n\nCSC Nanjing Tanker's removal is part of China's efforts to restore confidence in a stock market that's seen its benchmark index plummet 31 per cent in the past three years, ranking it the worst performer among the world's major bourses. Another 29 Shanghai-listed companies have been warned that they'll be delisted if losses continue, including CSSC Steel Structure Engineering and Jiangsu Zhongda New Material Group, according to the exchange.\n\nUnder current rules, three straight annual losses triggers the suspension of share trading, while a fourth year would prompt delisting, according to the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges. Regulators broadened the delisting rules in 2012 to include companies with revenue of less than 10 million yuan (S$2 million) and low trading volumes.\n\nChina's securities regulator is also studying more \"market-oriented\" delisting rules, which may be released this year, the Shanghai Securities News reported last month, citing China Securities Regulatory Commission chairman Xiao Gang.\n\nChina announced this month it would allow cross-border trades between the Shanghai and Hong Kong exchanges. Regulators have also said they will reform rules to make initial public offerings a registration system similar to that used in the US.\n\nChina has removed 74 stocks from trading since 2001, while no companies have been delisted in Shanghai since 2007, according to Essence Securities Co.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/cma-shareholders-should-stand-their-ground-against-fair-offer", "site_title": "CMA shareholders should stand their ground against 'fair offer'", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nCMA shareholders should stand their ground against 'fair offer'\n\nCMA is a cash cow and is worth much more than that\n\nPublished\n\nMon, Apr 21, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE CapitaLand (CL) offer for the 35 per cent of the CapitaMalls Asia (CMA) shares they do not own is yet another example of the lack of respect for minority shareholders. The post-IPO performance of CMA shares and the paltry premium over the IPO price and book value multiple should concern all CMA shareholders.\n\nAt the November 2009 CMA IPO, all of the proceeds went to CapitaLand and none were invested into CMA. Thus the IPO and current offer are just asset trades for CL with no strategic benefit for CMA shareholders. Prior to the IPO, CL shares peaked at $8.60 and during the financial crisis fell almost 80 per cent. A few months later, CMA's IPO was priced at $2.12, closed the first day at $2.30 and the multiple of book value offered was 1.55x. The current offer of $2.22 is valued at a thin 1.2x book value.\n\nYet, now more than four years later, CL wants to pay only a 4.7 per cent premium to the IPO price, a 3.4 per cent discount to the day one closing price and a 23 per cent discount to the IPO book value multiple. Has CMA really deteriorated that much over the last four years?\n\nAt the time of the IPO, CMA had 59 completed projects and today there are 85, a 44 per cent increase. In 2013 vs 2012, revenue, profit and the asset value per share were all up about 10 per cent and operating income increased a whopping 40 per cent. Looking back to the IPO, in 2009, profit was $388 million and for 2013 it was $600 million, an increase of 55 per cent. Total equity in 2009 was $5.5 billion and at year-end 2013, it is $7.2 billion, more than a 30 per cent increase. So operating performance since the IPO has been quite strong and hardly justifies a discounted multiple to book value and a discount to the closing price after the IPO.\n\nCL will stress the offer price is at a premium to recent closing prices. Yet this is illusory as CMA is worth more than its market values and worth much more to CL than the offer price. CMA shares hit a high of $2.66 within days of the IPO on Dec 7, 2009. Two years after the IPO, the shares had fallen 60 per cent to a low of $1.13, while during the same period, the STI was unchanged. Within a few months of the IPO and aside from a few weeks in 2013, the shares traded below the IPO price about 90 per cent of the time. Even today, after the offer, the STI has still outperformed CMA's share price by 35 per cent since the day one close. Most of the dividends have gone to grow the business and reinvest in new projects, yet current investors are not being compensated enough for those investments and the projects currently being developed.\n\nCMA is 65 per cent owned by CL and at least one of the independent directors also sits on CapitaLand's board. Additionally the chairman of CapitaLand and CapitaMalls Asia are the same person. Thus the majority of the Board should not be considered independent in the transaction as five of 10 board members have direct ties to CL. CL has had direct control strategically and operationally of CMA as a public company. This includes a healthy conflict of interest as noted among the 26 pages of Risk Factors of the IPO prospectus; \"We cannot assure you (potential CMA investors) that the interests of our (CL) existing Reits or private real estate funds will not conflict or be subordinated to our (CL) interests in such circumstances. Furthermore, we cannot assure you (CMA Shareholders) that conflicts of interest will not arise in future . . .\"\n\nAs a minority shareholder, the odds are stacked against you. When a 65 per cent shareholder has to decide whether to put minority or their own shareholders first, it is clear that CL comes first. You were warned at the IPO.\n\nCL investors, including Temasek, should wonder why CL is not buying their own shares that are trading at only about 0.8x book value. Is it really the case that the CMA offer is so cheap that it is a better investment than buying CL shares at a 20 per cent discount to book value instead of CMA's 20 per cent premium?\n\nClearly the market sees the unique value in CMA, value that is not being provided to CMA shareholders. Just look at the CL share price since the CMA offer. Investors and analysts in CL have bid up the CL share price almost 10 per cent, to a level not seen for almost six months.\n\nCL wants to attain 90 per cent so as to delist CMA. This means buying at least 25 per cent of the outstanding shares. No doubt an IFA (independent financial adviser) can be found to give a \"fairness\" opinion. However there is a big difference between a minimally acceptable fair offer and receiving the full value of the company. CMA investors should expect the independent directors to maximise the value they receive and not just accept a price deemed \"fair\". But who is negotiating on behalf of CMA shareholders to get the best price?\n\nCL wants to buy CMA as cheaply as possible because it is a great asset. In short, CMA is a cash cow and is worth much more than they are offering now. Shareholders should be prepared to stand their ground in order to attain the full value for giving up their share of the company. CMA is very profitable and has strong dividends so even if CL walks away, the minorities are left with a good yielding asset. The China assets are increasingly valuable now that the government is focused on increasing consumption and domestic demand. CMA shareholders should be happy to hold onto their shares.\n\nOne hopes the independent directors will represent only the minority investors to the full extent of maximising the economic potential for shareholders. Since CL has now shown they are negotiating solely on their own behalf, it is up to the minority shareholders to make their decisions about whether they are getting full, fair or inadequate value. As a general matter, if minority investors won't stand up for their rights then they can expect even more poor performance from the majority managers of their assets.\n\nThe writer is the former regional CEO for Morgan Stanley and senior managing director for Temasek Holdings.

This was due to initial contribution from the newly completed redevelopment, Mapletree Benoi Logistics Hub, in Jurong industrial estate, positive rental reversions in Hong Kong and Singapore, contributions from a Korean warehouse acquired last June, and four Japan properties which have completed the installation of solar panels, it said.\n\nThis was, however, offset by lower revenue from the Japan portfolio due to a weaker yen, but \"the impact to distribution arising from the weaker Japanese yen was mitigated as the income streams from Japan have been substantially hedged\", it said.\n\nIt added: \"The impact of the weaker Japanese yen on (the trust's) net asset value is mitigated substantially as the majority of the Japan portfolio is funded by Japanese yen borrowings.\" Since borrowing costs also fell due to the softer yen, this provided something of a natural hedge.\n\nFor the full year, DPU was 7.35 cents, up from 6.86 cents a year ago, supported by an 8 per cent increase in distributable income to $179.7 million.\n\nThis included a divestment gain from 30 Woodlands Loop of $2.5 million. Excluding this, the amount distributable to unitholders would have increased by 6.6 per cent, the Reit said.\n\nNet property held steady at $267.6 million, while gross revenue stayed at $310.7 million.\n\n\"Excluding the forex impact (the weaker yen), gross revenue would have increased by 4.7 per cent year-on-year ... Net property income would have increased by 3.6 per cent,\" the Reit said.\n\nIn FY2013/2014, the Reit also recognised a $105.3 million net appreciation in the value of its portfolio, comprising 111 assets, mostly from those in Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\nLooking ahead, the Reit said: \"The demand for logistics facilities in our markets is expected to remain robust ... The manager remains focused on driving organic growth from the existing portfolio through proactive leasing efforts and asset enhancements.\"\n\nThe Reit's units ended one cent lower at $1.075 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In fact, it can be criminal.\n\nCriminal sanctions\n\nThe 2008 case of Chuan Soon Huat Industrial Group Limited is an important example. It is the first time that independent directors were convicted of a crime and punished for management's failure.\n\nChuan Soon Huat was a timber door maker, listed on the Singapore Exchange. The board of directors failed to disclose that the executive chairman was ill and no longer discharging his duties, and that there had been a change in effective control of the company.\n\nThis omission was deemed to be a breach of the obligations of a listed company to announce any information likely to materially affect the value of its securities.\n\nSeveral directors including the two independent directors were charged and found guilty of the omission. The independent directors were fined and disqualified from acting as directors for a period of time. Chuan Soon Huat was eventually delisted from the Singapore Exchange.\n\nA year later, in the AirOcean Group Limited case, Ong Chow Hong, the non-executive chairman and independent director, was found guilty of failing to use reasonable diligence in the discharge of his duties by approving the release of a public announcement by a listed company without reviewing the contents of the announcement. He was fined and disqualified from acting as a director.\n\nBoth these cases illustrate the application of Section 157(1) of the Companies Act. This provision places an obligation on directors to act honestly and to use reasonable diligence in the discharge of the duties of their office. The breach of this duty may constitute a criminal offence punishable by a fine and/or a jail sentence.\n\nPut simply, under Section 157(1), one does not necessarily have to be guilty of fraud or negligence or show any loss to shareholders to be charged and convicted. Just failing to act diligently can be criminal.\n\nThe question is: should this be so?\n\nDecriminalising directors' duties\n\nThere is a clear distinction between fraud and dishonesty versus failing to act diligently.\n\nWhen a director acts fraudulently or dishonestly, he or she usually derives a personal benefit. In contrast, failing to act diligently is not ordinarily prompted by personal gain.\n\nUnderstandably, failing to act diligently can result in the company or other parties suffering losses. However, this can be addressed by having adequate safeguards to compensate for such losses and holding the director accountable for the loss.\n\nCivil penalties and other compensatory remedies suffice for this purpose.\n\nThe present onerous provisions of the Companies Act can deter good candidates from becoming directors. In practice, it can also lead to directors conveniently stepping down at the first sign of trouble, rather than staying to help the company move forward.\n\nThe present regulatory framework should therefore be changed to ensure a proper balance between compensation, deterrence and punishment. Unfortunately, the recently proposed amendments to the Companies Act still do not decriminalise directors' duties.\n\nAs these amendments are debated in Parliament later this year, this matter should be revisited. At the minimum, we should institute mitigating measures to exempt directors from liability. Already, corporate and securities laws recognise situations where a director is not liable, such as when he acts honestly and reasonably.\n\nThe Companies Act gives the Court discretion to excuse a director from liability for negligence in civil proceedings under such circumstances.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Act has provisions for instituting civil (rather than criminal) proceedings where there is no fraud or dishonesty involved.\n\nA practical deterrent can be found in the Court's ability to disqualify directors who have failed to act diligently from acting as directors or management of companies for a prescribed period (as is presently the case for criminal convictions under Section 157). The concept appears to have worked well in the context of securities regulation and is a viable tool for regulators to take action against errant directors without resorting to criminal sanctions.\n\nAfter all, the breach of a director's duty to act with reasonable care and diligence is no longer a crime in several other common law jurisdictions such as the UK and New Zealand. The time has come to adopt the same position in Singapore.\n\nThe writer is the First Vice-Chairman of the Singapore Institute of Directors\n\nFor more articles, go to\n\nbtd.sg/BMatters\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Former chairman Mr Low has a stake of 6.32 per cent in Pteris and Dr Soon, a stake of 5.56 per cent.\n\n\"We would strongly urge shareholders not to pre-judge the terms of the RTO until the independent financial advisers' (IFA) report is issued and not support any move that will jeopardise the RTO before it can come to the shareholders for their own decision,\" Mr Low and Dr Soon said. A separate EGM is slated to take place in Q3 this year to vote on the RTO.\n\nMr Tan, a non-executive director on Pteris' board, holds a 10.5 per cent stake in the firm. He is also seeking to appoint Ascendas Hospitality Fund Management chairman Lim Neo Chian, ST Engineering consultant Wu Tzu Chien, accountant Tan Han Beng and lawyer Elaine Beh to the board at the EGM.\n\nOn Saturday, Pteris issued a statement to the Singapore Exchange (SGX) underlining that a $90-million club loan - which the group is relying on to sustain its operations and existing projects - could be at risk. As it presently stands, the group has been granted a waiver from its banks after breaching a bank covenant, namely failing to maintain a tangible net worth of at least $40 million.\n\nHowever, that waiver is contingent on certain conditions, including key shareholder CIMC providing an undertaking of financial support as well as the Pteris board remaining unchanged until the RTO is complete.\n\nCIMC, which has a stake of about 15 per cent in Pteris, has also stressed that it will not re-negotiate the terms of the RTO, adding that the removal of the five directors will be seen as a \"lack of support by shareholders for the RTO\".\n\nAt a media briefing yesterday afternoon, Mr Lim Joo Boon and independent directors Gan Siok Loon, Fong Heng Boo and Robert Chew urged shareholders to reject the call for their removal at this Friday's EGM in order to avoid the possible recalling of the $90-million loan and to preserve the firm's financial health. As at Dec 31, 2013, Pteris had cash and cash equivalents of some $17.25 million.\n\nWhen contacted by BT last night, Mr Tan said that he \"did not find anything new about the points raised\" by the other directors.\n\nLast week at a dialogue with shareholders, Mr Tan promised to review the terms of the RTO and to seek alternatives should the ouster take place, in addition to outlining his plan to turn the firm around. He suggested reviving Pteris' old subcontractor business model, and the re-hiring of past Pteris management personnel.\n\nFor the financial year ended Dec 31, 2013, Pteris (formerly Inter-Roller Engineering) chalked up a net loss of $29.7 million, which was close to the loss registered in the previous fiscal year, against a revenue of $50.4 million, down 23 per cent.\n\nA trading halt was called on the counter last Thursday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The container industry, which accounts for the biggest share of ship loans among German lenders, has suffered from overcapacity since the global financial crisis triggered a trade slump and the worst decline in charter prices in decades.\n\nThe crisis will have a long-term impact on shipping banks, Mr Stoltenberg said. \"The history of default will make it hard for shipping lenders to keep the faith in the assets in the same way they did before the crisis,\" he said.\n\nHSH Nordbank reported nine billion euros of bad shipping debt, or about 43 per cent of its loans to the industry, in fourth-quarter earnings published. Non-performing shipping loans at Commerzbank, Germany's second-biggest bank, amounted to about 3.9 billion euros at the end of last year, or 27 per cent of the 14 billion euros in total lending, according to the company.\n\nDeutsche Bank, which Mr Stoltenberg joined on April 15 from NordLB, had a shipping portfolio of 5.9 billion euros at the end of last year, including 5.3 billion euros in loans and 600 million euros in commitments, spokesman Frank Hartmann said last Thursday. The lender declined to comment on the share of non-performing loans.\n\nThe shipping loans have become a focus for the European Central Bank as it probes the finances of Europe's biggest banks before taking over as their regulator in November. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Meanwhile, India's attractiveness remains more or less stable.\n\nTokyo has been cautioning businessmen for some time not to \"overconcentrate\" investment in China, and the business view in Japan now seems to be getting more aligned with the government's.\n\nJapanese FDI in Thailand more than tripled last year to just over one trillion yen, boosting the total going to Asean very significantly. But this was largely due to big Japanese merger-and-acquisition (M&A) deals in Thailand. Meanwhile, the amount of Japanese FDI in Singapore (always volatile) also almost tripled to 355 billion yen last year compared to 2012.\n\nA Jetro survey showed that \"China fell from first to fourth place\" as a promising investment destination for the medium term - the first time this has happened since such surveys began in 1992. \"Indonesia, where market expansion expectations are high, took first place for the first time.\"\n\nMr Ishige denied a suggestion at last week's briefing that there were signs of \"anti-Chinese bias\" in the way the picture was presented. He stressed his own efforts to build links with local governments in China and to persuade them to be more welcoming towards Japanese investment.\n\nBut at the same time he acknowledged that the view of China taken at Japanese company headquarters in Japan is often more pessimistic than that taken by the local headquarters of Japanese firms operating in China.\n\nAnti-Japanese riots in a number of Chinese cities in the latter half of 2012 - after the then Japanese government \"nationalised\" the Senkaku islands (known in China as the Diaoyu islands) in the East China Sea - were followed by a sharp drop in already declining Japanese investment in the world's second largest economy.\n\nAside from heightened risk awareness quoted by Mr Ishige as one reason behind the declining attractiveness of China as an investment destination for Japanese business - and the consequent drop in plans for future investment there - rising labour costs in China are also cited.\n\nBasic salary levels per worker in China, while slightly below those in Malaysia and on a par with those in Thailand, are significantly above the levels in the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Bangladesh and India, according to Jetro.\n\n\"There are few cases of Japanese companies completely withdrawing from China,\" said Jetro. \"Many (cases) involve the transferring of production, mainly in labour-intensive industries such as apparel\" from China to other parts of Asia.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The drone has searched about half its targeted area, the authorities said yesterday.\n\nThe Malaysian government has said that the search is at a \"very critical juncture\" and asked for prayers for its success. Malaysian Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein has also said that the government may consider using more AUVs in the search.\n\nAfter almost two months without a sign of wreckage, the current underwater search is centred on an area where one of four acoustic signals believed to be from the plane's black box recorders was detected on April 8.\n\nWeeks of daily sorties have failed to turn up any trace of the plane, even after narrowing the search to an arc in the southern Indian Ocean, making this the most expensive such operation in aviation history.\n\nHopes for further black box signals are fast diminishing, since the black box batteries are now two weeks past their 30-day expected life span, search officials have said.\n\nBut while the Bluefin-21's target range has narrowed, the air and surface search continues unabated, with daily sorties a week after Australian search coordinator retired air chief marshal Angus Houston said that the air and surface component of the search would end within three days.\n\nYesterday, up to 11 military aircraft and 12 ships will help with the search, covering a total of roughly 48,507 sq km across two areas, the Perth-based Joint Agency Coordination Centre said. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

However, the picture is different in actual use case scenarios. A Gartner survey shows that last year, just 38 per cent of all organisations used cloud services. Since standardised cloud business models have not yet been set across industries, many organisations are concerned about things such as security and reliability of the cloud for mission-critical applications. To understand the challenges, as well as opportunities, BizIT brought together a group of experts to discuss the issue at a roundtable. Excerpts from the discussion:\n\nAmit Roy Choudhury:\n\nThe cloud computing model has gained mainstream acceptance across all verticals. However, this acceptance has not translated into revenue streams as cloud services, even though growing fast, still constitute a small part of overall corporate IT spending.\n\nCould you outline why you think this is so? What are the issues that most concern users and would be users of this model?\n\nDaryl Webb:\n\nSometimes people forget that cloud computing is still in its infancy. We are witnessing a fundamental shift in the IT industry. This is changing the way technology is delivered and consumed. The pay-as-you-go model for everything you need in IT is shattering the old computing paradigms, from software licensing models and hardware refresh cycles to budgeting operating costs. This change is bringing about more flexibility and cost control which resonates with everyone. So keep in mind that the movement to cloud is just getting started.\n\nWhat we're seeing from a customer adoption perspective is that issues about reliability, security, and control still persist. It comes down to trust on many levels. Trust is an essential element in this discussion. Without trust, there is no relationship, sales or adoption. Customers need to trust the technology as well as the service provider they choose.\n\nCorporate IT is often a barrier to cloud adoption. If I am the CEO or CFO (chief financial officer) of a company considering cloud as a business enabler or a way to manage costs, to whom do I turn for advice? Typically, the first stop is my IT management team. However, most people are reluctant to change and IT management is no different.\n\nAs a result, many early adopters have circumvented their IT departments entirely. The initial move into cloud computing with enterprises is often done via departments like HR (human resources), marketing and sales rather than through the traditional IT folk.\n\nIf the CMO (chief marketing officer) wants to run a new campaign that requires four servers, how long does it take corporate IT to execute? You need financial approvals, cost benefit analyses, justification, a project plan and IT staff to allocate resources, just to identify a few procedures.\n\nAssuming all that gets done and approved, the servers get ordered, delivered sometime later, then they need to get set up, racked and brought online. That usually takes an average of three months. By then, the CMO has moved on. The campaign was only going to run for three months, so the hardware probably wasn't going to get approved in the first place.\n\nMeanwhile, the marketing department has gone online, ordered and provisioned those servers in an afternoon, launched the campaign, only to find it was a runaway success, needing to add another server every week for the next month to match demand. The campaign was so successful, it achieved its target in six weeks, so they scale it back, reducing servers to one over the next two weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, IT have now received their capex (capital expenditure) approval, and are ready to place an order. So many corporations are already using cloud - Salesforce, or other similar SaaS (software-as-a-service) environments, and they just don't know it. The funds aren't in the IT budget so it is invisible.\n\nRequiring a credit card for payment also acts as a barrier to cloud adoption, particularly here in Asia. Credit card adoption to purchase cloud services is still very low. Our Softlayer's model is based on immediate approvals, so we can't go off and run a credit check. Credit cards, with appropriate anti-fraud controls, simplify that process, and enable us to keep the time-to-deliver as short as possible.\n\nCapital cycles are a factor in the speed of adoption. Companies that have made significant investments in in-house platforms are not going to throw them out until they have to. This will take time but we are definitely seeing more mission critical workloads going to the cloud.\n\nLooking at the cloud broadly, the driver for users is what they do with it - the applications - rather than how it is done. The biggest accelerator will be driven by application adoption.\n\nChris Chun:\n\n6Waves is more of a user of these services so we may not give the most accurate answer. But if I have to take a guess, I'd believe that the cloud in general solved the fragmentation problem for companies like ours.\n\nWhat I mean is if there used to be a lot of unused computing power on our end before switching to cloud, those fragments are now being transferred to these service providers. But the good news is overall, there's probably less wastage so it should be a win-win. What are the issues that most concern would-be users of this model?\n\nTo some corporate users, I believe privacy, security, and ownership of the hardware is still a big concern. Many friends and colleagues are concerned about having their algorithms, user data, and other sensitive material on hardware not completely controlled by them.\n\nFinancial institutes in particular have extremely strict policies on how their data centre is operated.\n\nKevin Lim:\n\nNaturally, as spending moves from large capex models to pay-as-you-go opex (operational expenditure) models, this would mean revenue streams for vendors shrink in the short term, relative to previous spend. But if one looks at the compound annual growth rates (CAGR) for cloud deployments in comparison to traditional procurements, it would paint a very different picture, especially if we were to extrapolate the data over say 5-10 years.\n\nOf course, the cloud consumption model favours certain usage patterns over others; and customers are beginning to use their budgets, whether capex or opex, in a way that extracts maximum utility at total cost of ownership optimised levels.\n\nArun Chandrasekaran:\n\nThe public cloud services market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.4 per cent through 2017. This high rate of growth outpaces all other major categories of IT spending. So cloud is indeed growing very fast. Cloud services are having a cannibalistic effect on the consulting and implementation market as spending gets redirected from traditional systems to new, cloud-based alternatives. IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-service) and SaaS are increasingly considered as alternatives to traditional outsourcing, particularly for organisations taking a hybrid approach to combining traditional models with new cloud-based models.\n\nHowever, there are still concerns with cloud computing. The key concerns that we see from customers are:\n\nAmit:\n\nCould you outline what are the immediate benefits which cloud computing can give companies both in terms of cost savings as well as improved efficiency in operations?\n\nKevin:\n\nFor new projects, the cost savings is immediate as consumption of computing resources is now optimised - and a side benefit of virtualisation and automation in cloud platforms is that many operational tasks that used to take a long time to execute from start to end is now drastically improved. Cloud and virtualisation also reduce demand on energy and data centre space, which not only impact operating costs but result in much greener computing!\n\nArun:\n\nThere are several opportunities to derive value or benefit from cloud. They are as follows:\n\nChris:\n\nFragmentation: instances are charged by the hour. Some companies also provide completely dynamic configurable instances. So if I've been running a server that never use more than 2.5 gigabytes of RAM (random access memory), I can get a slice at three gigabytes of RAM without having to pay for a \"template\" that provides four gigabytes.\n\nCost model and availability: The assumption is that hardware is available if we need to scale up a large amount of instances or cancel any instance in the next hour or so. Being a publisher, 6waves manages many games and if we can sign up or cancel any game easily, it means we are saving costs every month compared to monthly subscription models. Having no commitment helps decision making too.\n\nFast deployment and prototyping: For any new project, it might take many trials and errors. If I'm trying out many different tech, being able to try for an hour, dump my failed attempts and restart without having to go through hours of re-setup immensely improves prototyping speed. Team-mates can also easily spawn many similar instances to do quality analysis, load testing, or back-up.\n\nAuto-scaling: One of the bigger things for large companies is auto-scaling. If an app has lots of users and can easily scale horizontally, auto-scaling reduces lots of maintenance work.\n\nDaryl:\n\nPeople need to change their thinking around infrastructure - it doesn't need to be a capital expense that needs to be planned. IT is now a consumable, disposable item delivered in a pay-as-you-go model.\n\nI like to draw an analogy between cloud and transport. At the moment, when we think about infrastructure, we need to take a long-term view of the technology. This is like thinking about buying a car. If I need a car right now, I'm not going to just go out and buy one. I need to think of the long term requirements. I might want to drive to Kuala Lumpur with five friends today, but most of the time I'll only need to go to the mall and back once a week for shopping. Those needs are quite different. Do I buy a small shopping cart capable of carrying my shopping bags, or a six-seat van for my trips to Kuala Lumpur? What are my needs in total, as it's a long term decision? Those occasional uses of the vehicle define the \"peak\" need, and are cars bought for those peaks? For me, the answer is neither. A car that sits in the car park 90 per cent of the time is not a good investment either way. It might be great for prestige, but not for productivity. I should be looking at luxury coaches or a lease car for my Kuala Lumpur trips, and public transport, taxis, or a shared service like ZipCars for my weekend shopping. That maximises the utility of the car, while right-sizing my expenditure. And I haven't tied up capital. I pay for what I need when I need it, and I am not paying for what I am not using.\n\nThe cloud is the same thinking. Stop buying hardware for the peaks, or even the averages. Buy what you need when you need it, use it while you need it, and stop paying when you aren't using it.\n\nAmit:\n\nWhat are the things/steps that need to be taken to get more companies, particularly small and medium-sized businesses in the region to adopt cloud computing in an aggressive manner?\n\nDaryl:\n\nA number of SMBs (small and medium-sized businesses) I have talked to here in Singapore look to government incentives to drive technology decisions. There are productivity schemes that encourage SMBs to buy servers with the ability to write it off quickly, or even with rebates. This is like subsidising car buyers away from trains and taxis. This doesn't drive productivity. Removing these incentives will drive SMBs to see the financial benefits of cloud before they need the enabling capability of cloud.\n\nProductivity improvements come from optimising and improving business performance. This is not the realm of servers and networks, but of applications and mobile productivity devices. This is where the investment needs to be focused. For those few things the company truly competes on, truly succeeds on, they need best-of-breed solutions that enable competitive opportunity. For everything else, SMBs need to focus on cost. Applications will drive adoption. Applications that match the requirements, the pain points of the SMBs in the region.\n\nKevin:\n\nSurprisingly, many SMBs in developing countries are adopting cloud computing, especially SaaS in a more aggressive manner than in Singapore where there is already significant investment in IT. For many of these SMBs, say in China, the only business software they know is Software-as-a-Service. Their first business tool is already cloud-based. Early-adopter SMBs will gain competitive advantage through business agility and cost savings, and this is turn will force industry participation in the cloud economy.\n\nArun:\n\nCloud offers several benefits to SMBs such as cost savings, productivity gains, lower time to market, flexible resource consumption and overcoming initial ICT (infocomm technology) investment barriers. Here are some of the steps that could be taken to stimulate cloud adoption among the SMBs:\n\nChris:\n\nOne of the biggest things companies such as AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Softlayer provide for is their free tier. Small companies or clients new to cloud want to try things out without going through too many hurdles.\n\nSo I think elements such as self-served instant sign-up, free-tier, and ease of use are the most important elements. Note that I'm already assuming the providers already have the whole suite of OSs (operating systems) available. Many small companies use different types of OS and in particular different Linux distros.\n\nAmit:\n\nWhat more can be done?\n\nChris:\n\nThings like network quality, bandwidth costs, and customer services are also important. We've tried using cloud services where our instance has suddenly gone offline due to unknown failure and there's no one to respond to our problem unless we pay a crazy premium.\n\nIn an absurd case, we're only spending $100 or less on that instance and the cost to pay for instant customer support is more than $100. This contradicts with the basic vision of cloud computing where you want to attract small customers.\n\nSome providers also have side-costs where their computing power price doesn't reflect. So if you compare side-by-side, a live operation with some traffic might really be more expensive even though they always advertise themselves as being cheaper.\n\nDaryl:\n\nGoing back to the first question on adoption of cloud computing, in order to ensure that businesses are able to get the best of cloud infrastructure, it is essential to alleviate their concerns regarding reliability, security and control.\n\nOur customers have access to on-demand deployment - in as short as four hours, month-on-month contracts to meet vacillating scalability requirements and an internal global network with 2,000 gigabytes per second of connectivity.\n\nOur comprehensive security strategy maximises servers' uptime, protects private information, and reduces business risk. Data safety is critical to us and we provide services with certified operational procedures, a wide range of software and hardware security solutions, and strategic partnerships with key security companies. Moreover, we believe in complete transparency and streamlined server management. Our unique network architecture provides our customers total access to manage their environment without exposure to external threats.\n\nSo one could use SoftLayer's industry-leading Customer Portal, open API (application programming interface), and SoftLayer Mobile apps to fully manage their dedicated server from home, work, or on-the-go. One has command of more than 200 automated backend services and activities, including core functions such as server reboots, OS reload, load balancing, and more.\n\nThis series is brought to you by IBM\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Premium chocolate producer Cacao Barry has released a new line of chocolates called Purity from Nature, consisting of two dark chocolates and a milk chocolate variety named Inaya, Ocoa and Alunga respectively.\n\nAnd these are no ordinary chocolates.\n\nInstead of being extracted from their pods and left to ferment naturally, Cacao Barry's beans are put through a special fermentation process that has taken a total of seven years to develop. This new revelation in the world of chocolate is known as Quality Fermentation or Q Fermentation.\n\n\"Of all the steps in the chocolate-making process, fermentation was the one we knew least about because it's a natural process,\" says Pascale Meulemeester, vice-president of Global Brands Marketing, with Ad Interim vice-president for Gourmet Asia Pacific, Barry Callebaut, echoing the sentiment.\n\n\"We really believe that if you want quality you need to get down to the plantation and work with farmers to optimise the process,\" Ms Meulemeester explains.\n\nThis philosophy prompted the chocolate company to invest in research into the science of fermentation. The result: a new fermentation process that produces a higher yield of cocoa beans and a purer taste. Fermentation occurs after the cocoa beans have been taken out of the pods and are wrapped in big leaves - usually from a banana tree. Micro-organisms that exist naturally in the soil and leaves then act on the beans.\n\nHowever, not all the micro-organisms that ferment the cocoa beans are helpful. They can cause defects rendering some beans unusable.\n\nCacao Barry's process of Q Fermentation involves isolating the good bacteria from the bad to ensure purity and higher yield. The starter solution containing the good bacteria has been patented by the company.\n\nAt present, the company has 50 members of its team on the ground working closely with 8,000 farms mostly on the Ivory Coast to produce these high quality beans.\n\n\"Farmers get a higher yield, chefs get a purer chocolate that supports their creativity and consumers who try the desserts get a taste of purity,\" says Ms Meulemeester.\n\nJanice Wong, owner of the 2am Dessert Bar agrees, saying: \"Chefs always look out for a product that works with you. The Purity from Nature line is so good on its own that it doesn't require a lot of infusing and mixing.\"\n\nAlthough Purity from Nature is targeted at premium bakeries, hotels and confectioners, consumers will get the chance to taste Inaya at Chef Wong's dessert bar.\n\nThe dessert, called Goddess Dewi Resplendent in Inaya is so far the only one on the menu to make use of Purity from Nature but the chef says that experimentation with the other chocolates are still under way.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That topped the previous peak four years earlier, before the decline in housing values reduced revenue.\n\nThat increase helped boost collections for the year by 3 per cent over 2012. That was the biggest gain since 2009, when revenue climbed 9 per cent.\n\n\"With cities having increased real estate tax collections, it will really improve their bottom lines,\" said Brooks Rainwater, a director of research for the National League of Cities in Washington.\n\nThe financial recovery is easing the risk of credit-rating cuts for local governments, which could increase prices by pushing down yields as a result of less risk.\n\nBonds from local government issuers have gained 5.34 per cent this year through April 16, outpacing the broad market's 4.86 per cent advance, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data show. It would be the first time since 2008 that debt from cities, counties and townships have outpaced all securities in the US$3.7 trillion market.\n\nProperty taxes have taken longer to rebound than other types of levies, prolonging the effects of the 18 month recession that ended in 2009. It can take more than a year for tax bills to catch up with changes in home values. Some state laws limit annual property tax increases.\n\nIn Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee, property tax revenue rose 13 per cent in the 2013 budget year compared with 2012. With revenue hitting US$891 million, the government rebuilt fire stations and started work on a police station.\n\nIn Houston, where property tax collections are up more than US$100 million from the 2011 low, the city is putting more into its libraries and parks and has begun adding to its workforce.\n\nIn Washington, property tax collections in the year that ended in September rose about 5 per cent from the year before to US$1.9 billion. The city is spending more on schools and affordable housing.\n\nSan Jose, in the heart of Silicon Valley, is using the extra cash mostly to cover rising costs for employee healthcare and pensions. Property tax collections are set to rise 8.1 per cent for the year ending in June to about US$222 million, above the previous peak of US$210 million in 2009.\n\n\"We were able to stop the bleeding,\" said San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed. \"The real estate market will help us not have to cut services, but it is not strong enough to give us enough revenues to overcome these increasing costs.\"\n\nLocal governments remain hesitant to hire after cutting jobs from mid-2008 through March 2013, according to the US Labor Department. Since then, local governments, which employ about 14 million people, have added 57,000 workers.\n\n\"Property values are rebounding to a degree and fairly robustly in some locations, but the effect of that on the fiscal circumstances in many cities is not as salutary as we would like,\" said Steven Kreisberg, the director of collective bargaining for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which represents more than 1.6 million government workers and retirees.\n\nSince March 2013, property values have risen by more than 10 per cent each month from a year before, according the S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 US cities.\n\nNevada's Clark County has a backlog of projects awaiting funding, said Commissioner Steve Sisolak. The county's property tax collections during the year beginning in July are forecast to rise for the first time since 2009, though gains will be limited by state caps on how much they can increase.\n\n\"The county's turning a corner,\" Mr Sisolak said. \"You fall off a cliff fairly quickly, and it takes you a while to climb back out.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 18, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nHAVING spent 15 years working at Calvin Klein Home, Amy Mellen knows every product like the back of her hand. Which means she can easily spot any item in the collection, even when it appears for no more than a minute on the big screen.\n\n\"I would be watching a movie, and go, 'hey, that is our bedding they used',\" says Ms Mellen, who has been creative director of Calvin Klein Home since 2009. She was recently in town as part of the company's multi-brand blitz across Asia that included a one-of-a-kind architectural installation at the old Kallang airport.\n\nCalvin Klein Home was started in 1995, \"when Mr Klein couldn't find the right bedlinen that he wanted\", says Ms Mellen, who joined the company in 1999 as a senior designer. From a range of bedlinen, the home collection has now grown to nine categories of products, including bedding, bath, dinnerware, tabletop, table linens, giftware, rugs, down, and furniture.\n\nThe New York resident says that the Calvin Klein Home client is \"a modern man or woman, who knows the brand well and is already wearing the apparel and who wants the pared down minimal lifestyle.\" Just as with its fashion counterpart, the look of the Home collection is \"very understated, it is about quiet luxury and elegance,\" says Ms Mellen.\n\nNew product ranges are introduced twice a year, but unlike fashion, \"our items have to last a lot longer. It would be awesome if everyone changed things in their home twice a year, but we know that is not going to happen,\" she says. \"People invest in their home furnishings and these are pieces they have to live with for a long time, so our designs have to be long lasting.\"\n\nGood design to her is \"timelessness and lasts forever. It is something that you still like whether you bought it today or some years ago. It still looks good even years later.\"\n\nHer team of seven, including herself, works with the merchandise department to plan a list of items that needs to be created. \"Do we need a bar, a two-seater sofa? If yes, then we design one, and sometimes it works the other way too, where we suggest items to be added to the range,\" she says.\n\nIt becomes inevitable that some items get taken off production when new items are added on. But the brand has its evergreen designs. Among them is the bamboo flowers pattern, as seen on its bedlinen. \"Sex and the City's Carrie Bradshaw used that print for her bedlinens, and because everyone wanted her lifestyle, they wanted that same print too,\" says Ms Mellen. Even though the TV series ended its run 10 years ago, the bamboo flowers print is still very popular today.\n\nMs Mellen oversees all the designs that are produced in-house at her New York studio. \"We would dye fabric in the studio, or be sewing things, or building models of our furniture. Everyone loves to get their hands dirty,\" she says. \"And it is important to do so, as you cannot be creative sitting in front of a computer.\"\n\nInspiration comes to her not only from the runway - \"I like to look at Calvin Klein women's collection by Francisco Costa\" - but also include other aspects of life, such as cooking, art, architecture and nature. \"I have tear sheets, but mostly I rely on my photographic memory to store my ideas,\" she says.\n\nBeing a hands-on person, Ms Mellen also heads out to the factories to learn how things are made. \"It also helps me better understand the limitations of production,\" she says. The brand has factories around the world, including Vietnam and Malaysia for its furniture, bedding from Italy, upholstery from Los Angeles and North Carolina, and towels manufactured in Turkey.\n\nFor anyone who are new to the Home collection, Ms Mellen recommends getting their bedlinen. \"It is always nice to treat yourself to good quality bedlinen,\" she says, raving about the quality of the cotton. \"It's not about the thread count, but it is the twist of the cotton that makes our bedlinen so special.\"\n\nSelections from Calvin Klein Home are sold in Dubai, Thailand, Taiwan and China. Ms Mellen says their franchise partner is currently in talks with Robinsons to have the brand retail at the store.\n\nIt is no surprise to hear that Ms Mellen's home is much like a living showroom for Calvin Klein Home. \"I've got the bedding, plates, sofas, rugs, pillows, duvets...,\" she rattles on, adding that she is always bringing home new things, sometimes way too much. \"I entertain a lot, and people who come to my home will expect me to use Calvin Klein products,\" she says. She finds it a delight when people comment that they didn't realise that the company produced a particular item.\n\nBut what gets her more excited is when she goes to someone's home, and they use her products too. \"Often they don't know that I work for the brand, and it's exciting to see that they've chosen Calvin Klein for their home.\"\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\n@TaySuanChiangBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/booming-business-behavioural-finance", "site_title": "The booming business in behavioural finance", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nThe booming business in behavioural finance\n\nFinancial apps have interesting ideas on nudging people's behaviours in the right direction, but are still unproven, says BEN STEVERMAN\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Apr 20, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT'S hard to find a place today where concepts of behavioural finance aren't being applied to real-world situations. From London to Washington to Sydney, governments are experimenting with the psychology of decision-making and trying to \"nudge\" citizens towards better behaviours, whether that means saving more for retirement or signing an organ donation card.\n\nMeanwhile, businesses see opportunities for higher profits. To grab more attention and dollars from consumers, companies as far afield as banks and fitness-app makers carefully design their offerings with consumers' decision-making quirks in mind.\n\nMany behavioural interventions work, whether at reducing litter and power usage or boosting savings rates and organ donations. Yet these successes aren't the whole story.\n\nEven after rigorous experimentation and data analysis, the best-intentioned nudges can fall flat or backfire. Some may be behavioural band-aids that don't address deeper structural problems such as stagnating wages.\n\nNevertheless, consumers have jumped on the bandwagon, eager to be manipulated into the best version of themselves, and businesses are rushing to meet the demand.\n\nWhere many people need the biggest nudge, if not a shove, is with making financial decisions.\n\nEmotional triggers\n\nThe effect of emotion on investment decisions is usually negative - good old fear and greed, as well as paralysis from being overwhelmed by choice. At the same time, even if someone wants to build an emergency fund or open an IRA, bad spending and saving habits are hard to break.\n\nTo help users follow through on their good intentions, a raft of financial apps and online investing websites use a mix of encouragement, nagging, incentives and design.\n\nThe biggest problem that businesses - and governments - must solve is one that rarely comes up in a behavioural psych lab: how to get people's attention in a world filled with more distractions by the day.\n\nAn app or any tool designed to spur your self-improvement must battle the demands of work and family as will as the delights of the Internet and the 50 other apps on your phone.\n\nSo when it comes to investing, \"most people are asleep at the wheel\", says Mike Sha, co-founder and chief executive officer of SigFig, an online investment manager.\n\nThis is where Silicon Valley's skills come in handy. Adam Nash, CEO at online investment manager Wealthfront, which attracted more than US$800 million in assets in two years, notes that many of his employees once helped design social software like Facebook. They know, he says, \"how to design systems that trigger emotional responses\".\n\nYou know what Mr Nash means if you've ever unintentionally wasted hours crushing virtual candies, scrolling through your Facebook timeline or catapulting angry birds.\n\nThe digital world is specially built to be addictive - continually satisfying you in just the right way to keep you clicking, playing or posting. By living on mobile devices and using some of these digital techniques, apps can grab your attention in real time.\n\nThe app Check uses alerts, timed for when they'd be most effective, to make sure users pay their bills on time. Investment sites including Betterment and Wealthfront make investing as automatic as possible, while reducing distractions that might get users trading too much - so no charts of the day's stock market moves show up on their websites.\n\nStill, the tools in the academic behavioural kit can look flimsy when you try to apply them in real-world situations.\n\nAs Tony Stubblebine, co-founder and CEO of the coaching app Lift, puts it: \"There's a huge difference between the real world and theory.\"\n\nFor example, the theory of \"loss aversion\" says people react more strongly to the threat of a loss than the possibility of a gain. So a notification that you're about to be charged a $95 fee tends to be more motivating than an enticement to earn an extra $95 on your investments.\n\nBut few people want to use an app that catalogs their financial failings without some positive reinforcement.\n\nSocial groups can also be highly motivating, but no one wants Facebook friends to know that they've signed up for a weight-loss app or that they struggle with credit card debt. Even more frustrating for designers of behavioural products is that users' responses can be unpredictable.\n\nApp designers are used to testing everything over and over, from the wording of an alert to the colours in their infographics, to boost effectiveness. Do that long enough with behavioural nudges, however, and you'll find that what didn't work three years ago might work now, says Vince Maniago of the personal-finance site\n\nMint.com\n\n.\n\nAn app's early adopters can be very different from the broader public. Some apps try to sort users into various groups based on which incentives they respond to. Because everyone's personality and circumstances are different, the ideal apps of the future might give each user their own well-tailored nudge.\n\nIt's not just startups trying out commercial applications of behavioural ideas.\n\nBig behaviourists\n\nLarge, established financial companies have hired New York-based non-profit Ideas42 for help designing more effective savings products, as well as small-dollar loans and car loans with lower rates, according to executive director Josh Wright.\n\nThe organisation was co-founded in 2008 by Sendhil Mullainathan, a Harvard University economics professor and author of Scarcity: Why Having Too Little Means So Much.\n\nAdvisers include Richard Thaler, the University of Chicago economics professor who co-wrote Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness.\n\nIdeas42 - the \"42\" is a reference to the \"answer to the great question of life, the universe and everything\" in the novel The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - is now branching out into healthcare products, Mr Wright says.\n\nAnother prominent group in the behavioural finance field that Prof Thaler advised is the UK government's behavioural policy group, the Behavioural Insights Team (BIT).\n\nThe group reformed the way job centres handle the unemployed, changed the wording on government webpages to increase organ donations and sent text messages to encourage the payment of fines and taxes.\n\nThe BIT was spun off in February as an independent organisation that can offer advice worldwide.\n\nFollowing in the UK's footsteps, the White House in January introduced a US Social and Behavioral Science Team. It is testing ways to boost policies' effectiveness or reduce their costs, in areas ranging from college enrolment to veterans' benefits.\n\nExperts such as Mr Wright worry that as behavioural finance goes mainstream, it could spark fears that the field's insights are being used to trick people.\n\nTo that end, Ideas42 and BIT are careful to say they only work on projects that provide a social good. Both groups declined to name clients.\n\nFears of manipulation oversell behavioural finance's capabilities.\n\nExpect even the best-designed nudges to improve outcomes only 10-30 per cent, Mr Wright says.\n\nMr Sha says that, when prompted, \"it's pretty amazing even when 10 per cent of people do something\".\n\nFar more subtle\n\nSuspicions of behavioural mind control also ignore the fact that consumers are already being manipulated every day - every time they walk into a store, go online or watch an ad. This trickery has been going on for a long time, and it's often been far more subtle.\n\nTwo thousand years ago, it might have been a trader sweet-talking you into buying a lame donkey. Now it is a website asking for your credit card number so it can provide a free-for-a-limited-time promotion that it knows you will forget to cancel before you're charged.\n\nLike diet and weight-loss apps must battle the appeal of junk food designed to be addictive, spending and saving apps must help shoppers resist all manner of temptations dreamed up by advertisers and marketers.\n\nAnd any new credit product for the poor would have to elbow aside the firmly established predatory lenders.\n\nSo the biggest worry is not that these new behavioural self-help apps will take advantage of customers: It's that these products, so far unproven, fail to make a dent in the vast apparatus already distracting people from their best intentions. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/63b3433c75fce8ce092c857e63113a83954c18d3fc48d9c551871fba6ca343b9?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Decision helper: To help users follow through on their good intentions, a raft of financial apps and online investing websites use a mix of encouragement, nagging, incentives and design; Mint.com might let you know you're paying 167 per cent more for car insurance than people like you typically do"}]}

This was due to higher net property income, finance lease interest income from a tenant, and incentive payment received as income support for Ascendas Hi-Tech Development (Beijing) Co (AHTDBC) in relation to Z-Link business park in Beijing.\n\nThe distribution also included capital distribution of net income from AHTDBC, following its consolidation into the group from Oct 2011.\n\nNet property income rose 12.2 per cent to $112.3 million, while earnings per unit rose 31.9 per cent to 7.11 cents.\n\nRecognition of rental income from the recently added The Galen, Nexus@one-north and A-Reit City@Jin-qiao drove gross revenue 7.7 per cent higher to $156.5 million. Positive rental reversion also contributed to the increase in gross revenue.\n\nFor the full year, DPU was 14.24 cents, higher than the 14.05 cents a year earlier. The manager will not receive performance fees this fiscal year as DPU growth did not exceed the requisite 2.5 per cent to warrant payment.\n\nThe Reit benefited from a revaluation gain of $131.1 million for its 105 properties over its latest book value as at end-March 2014.\n\nFull-year net property income rose 6.6 per cent to $436 million, on the back of a similar 6.6 per cent increase in gross revenue to $613.6 million.\n\nTan Ser Ping, CEO and executive director of the Reit manager, said the Reit's portfolio achieved positive rental reversion of about 14.8 per cent for leases renewed in FY13/14. \"(This was because) the passing rental rates for most of these leases that were signed previously were below the current market rental rates. We expect the trend to continue in FY14/15, albeit at a more modest rate.\"\n\nThe occupancy rates for its portfolio buildings declined to 89.6 per cent, from 94 per cent a year ago, but this was because of a 5.1 per cent increase in net lettable area from the acquisition of A-Reit City @Jinqiao, the completion of Nexus@one-north and various asset enhancement works.\n\nIn the new fiscal year, about 21.3 per cent of the Reit's property income will be due for renewal. The Reit said its manager had begun renewal negotiations with these lessees.\n\nThe manager is also working towards divesting itself of 1 Kallang Place to Flextronics Manufacturing (Singapore) Pte Ltd, which is expected to be completed in May.\n\nAlthough the government has announced plans to increase industrial space this year, Ascendas Reit expects demand for its industrial and business space to stay healthy because of a \"tentative global recovery\".\n\nThe Reit's units ended one cent lower at $2.33 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

From Singapore's Temasek to China's Citic, Asian companies are increasingly relying on internal talent to get deals done. The loss of business in an already tough market means big investment banks will have to work harder to prove their worth.\n\nInternational banks have had a minimal role in two recent mega-deals. Temasek used its own mergers-and-acquisitions team to buy a 24.95 per cent stake in AS Watson, the retail business of Li Ka-Shing's Hutchison Whampoa, in March. Hong Kong-listed Citic Pacific has named only its own subsidiary, and a related outfit, as advisers on its 226.9 billion yuan (S$45.6 billion) acquisition of assets from its parent. Morgan Stanley worked on the deal, say people familiar with the situation, but isn't mentioned in public documents.\n\nBig banks are most easily sidelined in simple all-cash acquisitions of privately owned entities, where the buyer and seller already have a strong relationship. Those deals are common in tech, and in Asia. For large companies that are constantly acquiring smaller rivals, like Chinese search engine Baidu, having an internal team can be cheaper than paying traditional fees of one to two per cent of the purchase price. It also brings acquirers the added benefit of fewer leaks.\n\nThere's still room for the big outside firms on complex deals or those with regulatory issues. Temasek hired Credit Suisse to help it buy the shares it didn't already own in commodity trading house Olam International for US$2.1 billion. Deals that require financing, like WH Group's takeover of pork producer Smithfield in September 2013, will also\n\ncreate extra fees. Investment banks with large global networks also provide helpful distribution and can act as sounding boards for ideas.\n\nThe shift is a marked contrast to the market for IPOs. There, Asian companies can't get enough of banks. WH Group took on 29 for its IPO in Hong Kong, of which very few will likely be doing much work. It's ironic that mergers, an area where banks try to do their most value-added thinking, is where they're having to work even harder to stay in the game.\n\nHere's a closer look at the two recent mega-deals:\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLG Electronics shares jump on report of AI chip gear development\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:27 AM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nUS tariffs put spotlight on industrial S-Reits\u2019 upcoming H1 earnings\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM", "images": []}

The culinary luminaries talk to Jaime Ee about what drives them and why French food is not going out of style\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 18, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nRUMOURS of Joel Robuchon's demise have been greatly exaggerated. Restaurant Joel Robuchon, that is - the Singapore outpost of France's acclaimed \"Chef of the Century\" - where talk is rife of its imminent closure, hot on the heels of its compatriot Guy Savoy at Marina Bay Sands.\n\nThe man in question is none too pleased - at naysayers betting on his restaurants (including the upscale casual L'atelier) going belly up. Such rumours have dogged them since they first opened and may have intensified because their three year lease is up. But Mr Robuchon confirms that he has just signed on for another six years. And - the high-end Robuchon restaurant is seeing more covers than before, thank you, making it an even better performer than the more affordable L'Atelier.\n\nThe 69-year-old is in town this week as part of a punishing schedule that has him jetting around the world to oversee his ever-growing empire of restaurants.\n\nIt's rare for someone of his stature - the iconic chef has 28 Michelin stars at last count, the most in the world - to be personally visiting every restaurant in his stable, but it says something about the longevity of a career in an industry dominated by the World's 50 Best list of celebrity chefs and the perennial pursuit of the next big trend.\n\n\"He doesn't want any more restaurants,\" laughs his right hand man Philippe Braun, who helps to translate for Mr Robuchon. \"He tries to refuse the demands but if it comes from people he is close to like people who have been working for us or famous friends like Jean Reno who wants to open a L'Atelier in New York, he says 'yes' and then he has to deal with the challenges!\"\n\nHe also has no time for restaurant guides or media-driven polls of what constitutes quality or the latest trends. In fact, he jokes about journalists falling into the \"trap\" of guides like the World's 50 Best where \"the best restaurants in the world are those which poison their clients\", in a cheeky reference to the food poisoning cases that hit The Fat Duck (and then Dinner by Heston) and Noma.\n\nBut more seriously, he was a member of the jury at the World's Best and \"it is not the best guide in terms of impartiality and the way it works\". The voting is based a lot on \"friendship\" and \"if a restaurant is very popular in the media it will get the most votes\". Instead, Mr Robuchon puts more store in the Michelin Guide, which he says doesn't have a big lobby behind it.\n\nHe thinks it would be good if the guide came to Singapore, so that it can at least set a standard of quality that restaurants can measure themselves against. He says it in the context of his theory that an element of \"protectionism\" in the Singapore culture makes it tougher for a foreign name to be accepted locally - which could explain the rumours about his restaurants and Guy Savoy's closure.\n\n\"It is surprising that Guy Savoy is very good around the world but not in Singapore,\" he notes drily. \"Or maybe it is because Singapore people have the right taste and people around the world don't.\"\n\nHe stresses that it's just an observation, but as a personal friend of Mr Savoy, he feels the restaurant got short shrift. \"I have a lot of respect for what he is doing, maybe his cooking is not to the taste of Singapore people but he is still a high-level chef.\" He adds that the last time he spoke with Mr Savoy, the latter told him that he did not want to continue in Singapore as it was a tough environment and he did not feel welcome.\n\nThe opposite is true of Mr Robuchon, who's built up a loyal Singaporean fan base, some of whom even follow him wherever he goes. \"I see more Singaporeans in Macau than I do here in Singapore!\" he laughs. At Sentosa, high rollers fill most of the seats at the gastronomic restaurant, which accounts for its edge over L'Atelier. There's also no denying the Robuchon emphasis on consistency and quality, made even more special when its exceedingly humble and hospitable founder is in town to personally greet his guests.\n\nHe readily admits that it wasn't easy to open in Singapore. The hardest part of transporting a foreign concept is to bridge the cultural gap between his team and the local employees and partners. \"It is about us bringing our culture, and adapting to the local one,\" he says. \"It takes a very long time to 'bend' all this together to get an efficient team.\"\n\nSuch were the difficulties that it was \"only a few months ago that we were finally happy with the team\", he explains. \"But we were not at the level we wanted for a very long time.\"\n\nWhile fads come and go, and media pundits have all but declared French cooking a slow-roasted dodo in favour of Peruvian, Nordic, Japanese and Spanish cuisine, Mr Robuchon believes otherwise.\n\n\"There's a lot of demand for French restaurants in cities like Tokyo and Hong Kong, and in emerging countries where they are developing their tourism. In Paris, the restaurants are still very full. Maybe people overseas are not aware of the names of the very good chefs but their restaurants are always full.\"\n\nHowever, \"the direction for gastronomy is to be more casual, but there is still a need for very high gastronomy\", he says. \"There will be a lot fewer outlets in the world but these establishments will be at the very top level and very expensive.\"\n\nVegetarianism will also evolve, especially as \"it becomes harder to increase world production of animal protein\". When opening in Mumbai, he became fascinated with Indian vegetarian cuisine and thinks that is the way cuisine will go - not Indian per se but the use of spices and healthier eating in general.\n\nYoung chefs will also lead the way, especially now that they have more opportunity to travel and stage at top restaurants, and exchange ideas on social media. \"The overall standard is going up,\" he says. \"These chefs are able to mix all the techniques they learned from their travels and create something really exciting.\"\n\nBeing in his position doesn't mean that he's above learning from trends, even if he doesn't follow them. For example, he is good friends with Ferran Adria and even tried some of his molecular cuisine techniques but when he saw how he was \"going too strong into additives, I stopped\".\n\nSo far, following his own heart - while being open to other opinions - has served him well. And if there's any more talk about closure, one look at the way Mr Robuchon discreetly hovers over the kitchen and mingles with his guests says it all: he's here for the long haul.\n\njaime@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Add the upcoming tapas bar upstairs and you've ticked off all the boxes on the \"fashionable contemporary restaurant\" checklist.\n\nThe food is deliberately pared down with an emphasis on simple la plancha (cooked in the pan), slow-cooking and braised meats that's more home-style than sophisticated. Still the concept of fusing the three countries seems more semantic than anything - why not just call it Mediterranean and save a few extra words?\n\nBut if you're into details, the menu indicates helpfully which region the dishes originate from. For example, the squid plancha is from Barcelona, the slow-cooked octopus from Provence and the slow-cooked Iberico pork belly is from Madrid. There are also a few dishes from the region of Una, such as scallops la plancha with veal cheeks or rose wine jelly. We haven't been able to identify exactly where Una is and there may be no such place unless it's a newly discovered territory that shares the same co-ordinates as the restaurant.\n\nIn reality, the food is pretty much a hodgepodge with an underlying message that says it's kind of Spanish but not completely so. The cooking passes muster but is inconsistent, either let down by the quality of the ingredients or an imbalance of cooking time, seasoning and harmony of flavours.\n\nThe squid la plancha ($15 for starter portion and $26 as main) starts off promisingly with its appetising pan-seared edges, thick squid ink sauce and garlic mayonnaise on the side and addictive savoury cookie-like crumbs scattered around it. Everything is perfect except for the rubbery flesh which gets tiring to chew after the first few morsels.\n\nThat said, the day's special fish soup ($34) is slurped to the last drop with its thick bisque-like flavour that tastes almost comfortingly like the old-fashioned canned variety - it's not an insult, mind you, as it's the familiarity that hits the spot. Prettified with chunky toasted bread and shaved Parmesan, this should be a permanent addition to the menu.\n\nThe slow-cooked octopus with its dusting of paprika and blobs of red pepper puree ($21/$31) could do with a little longer cooking time to reach a more tender texture - otherwise it has a smooth partner in the red pepper puree although the tomato fondue tends to muscle in too aggressively.\n\nIncidentally, chef Patruno is pretty generous with his servings, so the starter portions are more than enough for the moderate eater, and it also means you can order a few more dishes for variety.\n\nThe squid ink rice or arroz negro ($28/$38) - said to be a bestseller at Bomba - makes an appearance here and in the first few bites we can almost see why with the unctuous midnight coloured squid ink sauce hanging on tight to each and every grain of rice mixed with tender squid bits. The bonus is the shatteringly crisp-battered squid fritters on top. But continue eating and a peppery saltiness starts to override any natural briny flavour you initially taste.\n\nFor the mains, baby lamb rack with ratatouille ($38/$48) comes both medium rare as requested, and overcooked on the same plate, although the hearty ratatouille and the meat is a sure-win combination. But something's really wrong with the slow-cooked pork belly ($32/$42) which goes bone dry and stringy when you move beyond the layer of skin and fat.\n\nThe day's special rice pudding dessert can also use an infusion of texture and character instead of the flat, mushy grains soaked in milk with plump raisins that arrive neither warm nor cold, and minus the plump chewy grains we prefer. The stubby hot churros work better though ($16/$29), as they're served piping hot and crisp on the outside and only a little mushy inside. Dunked in chocolate sauce with ice cream on the side, it's hard to say no to this.\n\nOverall, the team tries hard - eager to please and always soliciting feedback, which means things will improve as they settle in. But fixating on three major cuisines may be a little more complicated than necessary. Rather than being a chef of all regions, perhaps chef Patruno could work towards being the master of one - his own.\n\nRating:\n\n6.5\n\nWHAT OUR RATINGS MEAN\n\n10: The ultimate dining experience\n\n9-9.5: Sublime\n\n8-8.5: Excellent\n\n7-7.5: Good to very good\n\n6-6.5: Promising\n\n5-5.5: Average\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By MINDY TAN\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Apr 20, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE self-storage industry, fresh from a round of consolidation last year, is likely to face another round in the coming years. But that is not stopping Lock+Store from ramping up its expansion plans.\n\nThere are currently four Lock+Store facilities in Singapore; the self-storage solutions provider says this will double to eight in the near term, even as it rolls out its first overseas facility in Temasya Industrial Park, Glenmarie, in Selangor.\n\nExpected to be fully operational by September, the mixed-use office and warehouse complex in Malaysia will comprise about 200 self-storage units of varying sizes, ranging from nine square feet to 200 square feet. Charges are about RM6 (S$2.30) per square foot (psf) and customers will be able to choose between non-air-conditioned, air-conditioned, and wine storage units.\n\n\"We aim to target the surrounding businesses as well, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs) which tend to store their inventory at self-storage facilities to manage their operating costs,\" says Helen Ng, chief executive officer of Lock+Store.\n\n\"SMEs form the largest proportion of our corporate users in Singapore. We believe they will be the major growth drivers of our business in both Singapore and Malaysia,\" she adds.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted in the last quarter of 2013, of the 300 Lock+Store corporate users profiled, 57 per cent are SMEs. Start-ups constitute 16 per cent of corporate users and blogshop/online-retail users comprise 12 per cent. The remaining 15 per cent are multinational companies.\n\nPart of Lock+Store's allure for SMEs lies in the synergies it enjoys with SingPost Group following the latter's buying over of its entire business in 2012.\n\nMost suitable candidate\n\nIn July last year, for instance, the firm launched the \"store, pack and deliver\" service at its four facilities in Singapore. Using the scheme, storers - particularly SMEs and start-ups - are able to take advantage of the direct on-site sale of stamps, SmartPac and SpeedPost services.\n\n\"We're able to provide local logistics in the form of SpeedPost and SmartPac on site. This benefits our e-commerce customers and SMEs as they don't have to deal with a third party now,\" explains Ms Ng. \"We sell the packaging boxes and we drop that off at the post office for them . . . And if any of our customers require e-commerce support, we are able to provide that.\"\n\nMs Ng's involvement in the self-storage space stems from her travails in 2005 when she had to close her bar and restaurant after the landlord wanted the space back.\n\n\"At that point we were scrambling for alternative spaces but we couldn't find one that was suitable for our needs. And because we still had plans to start up a F&B business again, we had to look for storage. Everywhere we looked asked for a one- to two-year contract,\" she says.\n\nWhile this sparked Ms Ng's interest in the sector, she was aware that the local market was not ready. And so she bided her time.\n\nIn 2010, the opportunity to enter the market came up when Temasek Holdings' property arm Mapletree Investments sold Lock+Store to a consortium led by private equity fund firm Southern Capital Group.\n\nMs Ng was originally engaged by the buyers to conduct due diligence on the property. But they soon found her to be the most suitable candidate to run Lock+Store.\n\nToday, Lock+Store boasts almost 5,000 storage units which translate to 235,000 sq ft of lettable storage space. According to Cushman and Wakefield, it is one of an estimated 13 companies operating about 35-40 facilities islandwide.\n\n\"In terms of who is running the show, I think apart from the mom-and-pops, there are basically three big brands left now. There was a bit of consolidation going on in the last year,\" says Ms Ng.\n\n\"It was fairly unique in that Singapore's market developed so differently from the Australia and US markets. When we started out, most of the big brands were owned by equity funds . . . (and so) there was always that need to grow quickly and churn.\"\n\nThe next round of consolidation will likely be among the smaller players, says Ms Ng.\n\n\"They think (that as long as) they build, customers will come. They will realise very quickly customers don't come just like that. There's a lot more operational management involved,\" says Ms Ng.\n\nOnline payment options\n\nShe should know, having revamped Lock+Stock's business when she took over in 2010. These moves included the launching of marketing efforts to spread awareness about self-storage, bringing in a trainer to help staff grasp the finer points of selling space, and introducing processes to make the business more efficient.\n\nTo that end, she introduced online payment options as well as payment at 7-Eleven outlets to reduce delinquency in payments and established an online presence on social networking websites Facebook, Twitter and WordPress.\n\nLooking ahead, Lock+Store plans to open four more facilities in Kuala Lumpur and two facilities in Penang.\n\n\"Compared to the United States and Australia where the self-storage penetration rates are about eight sq ft per person and 1.2 sq ft per person, Singapore's penetration rate is 0.3 sq ft per person (based on June 2013's statistics of 5.4 million residents). Malaysia's is even lower,\" says Ms Ng.\n\n\"We have engaged a country manager and will engage more customer service/sales staff. Key members of our Lock+Store Singapore sales and customer service team will also travel to Malaysia to assist with the initial set-up and operations,\" she adds.\n\nToday the deputy chair of the first-ever Asia Self-Storage Association, Ms Ng says she is looking into a regional survey to give comparative data across the key Asian countries.\n\nShe intends to bring the Lock+Store brand to other places in the region in the future, including Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea.\n\ntanmindy@sph.com.sg\n\n@MindyTanBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Debbie Yong\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 18, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE pagodas atop Jin Yun mountain try their best to motivate visitors.\n\nPlacards along the ascent beckon: \"200 more steps to the summit\". Our local guide boasts of the view, up top, over tranquil Bei Bei, a district north of Chongqing, while retiree residents from the 12-million-population city - drawn here for the much-needed oasis of calm - clamber past us gingerly.\n\nBut we plug on today, cramping calves and all, neither for the view nor for the potential shame in lagging behind geriatrics. Because the best reward is the one well-earned, the carrot on our stick, really, is the private hot spring soak that awaits upon return to our lodging for the trip, the Banyan Tree Chongqing Bei Bei.\n\nThe Banyan Tree brand's first resort in south-west China is also a first of its kind for the company: besides seven hot spring pools on the resort's main grounds - there are separate indoor hot spring baths for males and females. Outside, five pools offer a mixed bathing experience. But the key feature of the six-month-old resort is the private, in-room hot spring jacuzzis that feature in each of its 107 suites and villas.\n\nThe water used to fill each in-room jacuzzi is piped in from nearby natural hot springs and the water temperature is constantly kept at 38 degrees Celsius, which makes it both perfect for a balmy morning soak and a soothing way to rinse off a long, weary day - as we did after that mountainous trek. Ahh.\n\nThe next day, we repeat the work-reward cycle again, this time meandering along the caves and crevices of Jindao Gorge, a 10km, four-hour trek through verdant foilage. Wild monkeys, gushing waterfalls, turquoise lap pools mystically shaped like hearts and a short boat ride in between complete the Indiana Jones-que adventure.\n\nBut if you're the sort of weekend spa tripper (Chongqing is just a five-hour flight from Singapore) who still wants the buzz of city life, the resort will be able to arrange tours of downtown Chongqing, a 50-minute drive away, where you can pen in retail therapy sessions in destinations such as Hongya Cave. Built in the traditional stilted-house architectural style of the minority Bayu tribe, the recently refurbished complex is today a modern, commercial hive of late night bars, souvenir shops and hot pot restaurants etched into a cliff overlooking the Jialing river.\n\nThe best vantage point to take it all in is on a tranquil sunset river cruise, where you can watch the city slowly come alive at night - blinking neon lights and all. Or, if it all gets too tacky, seek solace from the madding crowd in the luxury boutiques and high-end department stores that make up Jiefang Bei, a pedestrianised network of roads that also serves as the city's central business district.\n\nBusinessmen looking for a quiet extended weekend stay after a long week of meetings in downtown Chongqing can have the resort plan a day trip out to Pianyan Old Town, a stone's throw north of Bei Bei. The 300-year-old ancient town was formerly the business centre of ancient China, but today plays home to a sleepy community of older folk who play high-speed Sichuan-style mahjong on circa-2014 automated mahjong tables. Join them for a round or kick back over a meal of traditional Sichuan delights such as beancurd dipped in chilli oil and spicy pig's ears, as the locals do, on dinner tables set right on the passing streams that criss-cross the town.\n\nA more luxe dinner alternative, however, would be to head back to one of the Banyan Tree Chongqing Bei Bei's three restaurants. Ming Yue serves up international breakfast buffets and Cantonese dim sum, while Jin Yao Xuan is the go-to for the region's signature Sichuan hot pot, served in more hygienic individual hot pots. Those from a generation pre-dating the establishment of the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority will revel in the availability of banned-in-Singapore animal innards such as pig's brains, duck's blood and the kway tiao-like duck intestines, all prepped fresh daily in Jin Yao Xuan's kitchens. For the squeamish, there is the more familiar fine Cantonese fare plated up at Bai Yun which, proud as native Chongqing residents are of their heritage, they will admit is one of China's finer cuisines.\n\nPost-meal, head back to the resort's villas, built in the Min Guo architectural style - traditional Chongqing multi-storey folk houses that are a blend of Chinese and Western elements - and apply the relaxation ritual that has quickly become a daily mantra during our stay at the Banyan Tree Chongqing Bei Bei: Rinse, soak, repeat.\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\n@DebbieYongBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Five companies made six purchases worth $500,000 versus two firms with three disposals worth $60,000. The figures were sharply down from the previous week's five-day totals of 12 companies, 20 purchases and $6.4 million and four firms, nine disposals and $940,000.\n\nBuyback activity remained high with five companies posting 16 repurchases worth $3.53 million, not far off from the previous week's five companies and 18 transactions but the value fell sharply (previous week: $19.26 million).\n\nPopular Holdings\n\nThe publisher and bookstore operator bought back for the first time since August 2013 with 5.194 million shares purchased (April 14-17) at an average of 24.4 cents each. The trades, which accounted for 70 per cent of the stock's trading volume, were made on the back of the 13 per cent drop in the share price since September 2013 from 28 cents. The group acquired 24.959 million shares (Jan-Aug 2013) at 24-28 cents each or an average of 25.7 cents and 1.836 million shares on Dec 20, 2012, at 23 cents. The trades since December 2012 are the group's first repurchases since buybacks were introduced by the local stock exchange in June 1999. On March 14, the company announced a 30.8 per cent drop in third-quarter profit to $8.141 million while earnings in the first nine months fell by 33.2 per cent to $13.422 million (Thursday's closing share price: 23 cents).\n\nGP Industries\n\nConsumer electronic products manufacturer GP Industries bought back for the first time since October 2013 with 240,000 shares purchased (April 15-17) at an average of 48.1 cents each. The trades, which accounted for 77 per cent of the stock's trading volume, were made on the back of the 16 per cent rebound in the share price since January from 41.5 cents. The counter is still down since November 2013's 51.5 cents. The group acquired 11.15 million shares from Jan 16 to Oct 9, 2013, at 43-52 cents each or an average of 50.3 cents and 10.89 million shares from August 2010 to January 2011 at 44 cents to 60 cents each or an average of 56.5 cents (Thursday's close: 59 cents).\n\nSoup Restaurant Group\n\nRestaurant chain operator Soup Restaurant Group picked up where it left off in March with 347,000 shares purchased from April 15 to 16 at an average of 24.9 cents each. The group previously acquired 2.4 million shares from Jan 9 to March 17 at 26.5-24.5 cents each or an average of 25.6 cents.\n\nThe group acquired 8.9 million shares from Aug 7 to Dec 30, 2013, at 16-27 cents each or an average of 20.9 cents. The repurchases since August 2013 are the company's first buybacks since the stock was listed in May 2007. The acquisitions were made on the back of the sharp rise in the share price since November 2012 from 11.8 cents (Thursday's close: 24 cents).\n\nOCBC Bank\n\nThe bank has been buying back heavily this month with two million shares purchased from April 1 to 14 at an average of $9.66 each. It recorded buys in each of that 10-day period. The trades, which accounted for 4.3 per cent of the stock's trading volume, were made on back of the 8 per cent drop in the share price since November 2013 from $10.53.\n\nThe group acquired 14.46 million shares from February to October 2013 at $11.19 to $9.84 each or an average of $10.40. Prior to the buybacks since February 2013, the bank acquired 18.2 million shares from January to November 2012 at $7.92 to $9.52 each or an average of $8.89 and 213.1 million shares worth $1.44 billion from March 2000 to December 2011 at $5.10 to $10.26 each or an average of $6.77 (Thursday's close: $9.65).\n\nSamko Timber\n\nChairman Koh Boon Hong recorded his first on-market trade since September 2012 with 54,000 shares purchased on April 14 at 12.6 cents each, increasing his holdings (direct and deemed) to 56.707 million shares (4.04 per cent). The acquisition was made on the back of the 22 per cent drop in the share price since June 2013 from 16 cents. He acquired 377,000 shares in September 2012 at an average of 12.3 cents. Also positive in the past two months is Sampoerna Forestry with 401,000 shares purchased on March 28 at 12.9 cents each, which boosted its direct stake to 572.655 million shares (40.86 per cent).\n\nThe group acquired 984,000 shares on Jan 13 and 13.309 million shares from April to December 2013 at an average of 15 cents each.

Overall, Mr Wong's stake is up by 18 per cent since the stock was listed in July 2013. His purchases were made at below the IPO price of 20 cents. The company announced its annual results in February with profit down by 97.2 per cent to $110,340 (Thursday's close: 17.7 cents).\n\nHong Leong Asia\n\nNon-executive director Ernest Colin Lee recorded his first on-market trade in consumer products, diesel engines and industrial packaging firm Hong Leong Asia since May 2007 with 10,000 shares sold on April 14 at $1.545 each. This reduced his direct holdings by 20 per cent to 40,000 shares or 0.01 per cent of the issued capital. The sale was made on the back of the 24 per cent rebound in the share price since February from $1.24. The counter is still down since February 2012's $2.12. He previously sold his entire direct stake of 50,000 shares in May 2007 at $2.33 each. That sale was made at a profit based on the initial 50,000 shares that he acquired in May 2006 by exercising options at $1.51 each. Mr Lee unloaded his entire holdings of 43,000 shares in May 2006 at an average of $1.73 each. He acquired 30,000 shares in March 2005 at $1.25 each and unloaded 37,000 shares from October to December 2004 at $1.51 to $1.33 each or an average of $1.36 each (Thursday's close: $1.62).\n\nOverseas Education\n\nPrudential plc bought shares of the private foreign educational services provider at higher than its sale price in September 2013 with a purchase-related filing on April 15 of 238,000 shares at 84.5 cents each. This increased its deemed holdings to 29.148 million shares (7.02 per cent). The group reported a disposal-related filing in September 2013 of 217,000 shares at 76.3 cents each.\n\nPrudential became a substantial shareholder in February 2013 after buying 14.99 million shares at 62.1 cents each, raising its interest from 3.8 to 7.38 per cent. The trade prices were higher than the February 2013 IPO price of 48 cents. Overseas Education announced its year-end results in February with profit up by 9.5 per cent to $22.61 million (Thursday's close: 85.5 cents).\n\nFrasers Centrepoint Trust\n\nSchroder plc unloaded more of retail Reit Frasers Centrepoint Trust with a disposal-related filing on April 9 of 5,000 units at $1.80 each, reducing its deemed holdings to 57.749 million units or 7.0 per cent of the issued capital.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/garcia-marquez-conjuror-literary-magic", "site_title": "Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, conjuror of literary magic", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, conjuror of literary magic\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 18, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nGABRIEL Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, the Colombian novelist whose One Hundred Years of Solitude established him as a giant of 20th-century literature, died on Thursday at his home in Mexico City. He was 87.\n\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez learned he had lymphatic cancer in 1999, and a brother said in 2012 that he had developed senile dementia.\n\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1982, wrote fiction rooted in a mythical Latin American landscape of his own creation, but his appeal was universal. His books were translated into dozens of languages. He was among a select roster of canonical writers - Dickens, Tolstoy and Hemingway among them - who were embraced both by critics and by a mass audience.\n\n\"Each new work of his is received by expectant critics and readers as an event of world importance,\" the Swedish Academy of Letters said in awarding him the Nobel.\n\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez was a master of the literary genre known as magic realism, in which the miraculous and the real converge. In his novels and stories, storms rage for years, flowers drift from the skies, tyrants survive for centuries, priests levitate and corpses fail to decompose. And, more plausibly, lovers rekindle their passion after a half-century apart.\n\nMagic realism, he said, sprang from Latin America's history of vicious dictators and romantic revolutionaries, of long years of hunger, illness and violence.\n\nIn accepting his Nobel, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez said: \"Poets and beggars, musicians and prophets, warriors and scoundrels, all creatures of that unbridled reality, we have had to ask but little of imagination. For our crucial problem has been a lack of conventional means to render our lives believable.\"\n\nLeft-wing perspective\n\nLike many Latin American intellectuals and artists, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez felt impelled to speak out on the political issues of his day. He viewed the world from a left-wing perspective, bitterly opposing General Augusto Pinochet, the right-wing Chilean dictator, and unswervingly supporting Fidel Castro in Cuba. Castro became such a close friend that Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez showed him drafts of his unpublished books.\n\nNo draft had more impact than the one for One Hundred Years of Solitude. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's editor began reading it at home one rainy day, and as he read page after page by this unknown Colombian author, his excitement mounted. Soon he called Argentine novelist Tom\u00e1s Eloy Mart\u00ednez and summoned him urgently to the home. Eloy Martinez remembered entering the foyer with wet shoes and encountering pages strewn across the floor by the editor in his eagerness to read through the work. They were the first pages of a book that in 1967 would vault Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez onto the world stage.\n\nOne Hundred Years of Solitude would sell tens of millions of copies. Chilean poet Pablo Neruda called it \"the greatest revelation in the Spanish language since Don Quixote\". Novelist William Kennedy hailed it as \"the first piece of literature since the Book of Genesis that should be required reading for the entire human race\". Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez was rattled by the praise. He grew to hate One Hundred Years of Solitude, he said in interviews, because he feared his subsequent work would not measure up to it in readers' eyes. He need not have worried. Almost all his 15 other novels and short story collections were lionized by critics and devoured by readers.\n\nGabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez was born in Aracataca, a small town near Colombia's Caribbean coast, on March 6, 1927, the eldest child of Luisa Santiaga M\u00e1rquez and Gabriel Elijio Garc\u00eda. His father, a postal clerk and telegraph operator, could barely support his wife and 12 children; Gabriel, the oldest, spent his early childhood living in the large, ramshackle house of his maternal grandparents. It influenced his writing; it seemed inhabited, he said, by the ghosts his grandmother conjured in the stories she told.\n\nHis maternal grandfather, Nicol\u00e1s M\u00e1rquez Mej\u00eda, a retired army colonel, was also an influence: \"the most important figure of my life\", Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez said. The grandfather bore a marked resemblance to Colonel Buend\u00eda, the protagonist of One Hundred Years of Solitude, and the book's mythical village of Macondo draws heavily on Aracataca. Much of his fiction unfolds in or near Macondo, just as William Faulkner, whom he admired, invented Yoknapatawpha County as the Mississippi setting for some of his own novels.\n\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez moved to Bogot\u00e1 as a teenager. He studied law there but never received a degree; he turned instead to journalism. The late 1940s and early '50s in Colombia were a period of civil strife known as La Violencia. The ideological causes were nebulous but the savagery was stark: as many as 300,000 deaths. La Violencia would become the background for several of his novels.\n\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez eked out a living writing for newspapers in Cartagena and then Barranquilla, where he lived in the garret of a brothel and saw a future in literature. \"It was a bohemian life: finish at the paper at 1 in the morning, then write a poem or a short story until about 3, then go out to have a beer,\" he said in an interview in 1996. \"When you went home at dawn, ladies who were going to Mass would cross to the other side of the street for fear that you were either drunk or intending to mug or rape them.\"\n\nHe read intensely - Americans Hemingway, Faulkner, Twain and Melville; Europeans Dickens, Tolstoy, Proust, Kafka and Virginia Woolf. \"I cannot imagine how anyone could even think of writing a novel without having at least a vague idea of the 10,000 years of literature that have gone before,\" Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez said. But, he added: \"I've never tried to imitate authors I've admired. On the contrary, I've done all I could not to imitate them.\"\n\nStranded in Paris\n\nAs a journalist he scored a scoop when he interviewed a sailor who had been portrayed by the Colombian government as the heroic survivor of a navy destroyer lost at sea. The sailor admitted to him that the ship had been carrying a heavy load of contraband household goods, which unloosed during a storm and caused the ship to list enough to sink. His report, in 1955, infuriated Gen Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, the country's dictator, and Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez fled to Europe. He spent two years there as a foreign correspondent.\n\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez lost his job when his newspaper was shut down by the Rojas Pinilla regime. Stranded in Paris, he scavenged and sold bottles to survive, but he managed to begin a short novel, In Evil Hour. While working on that book he took time off in 1957 to complete another short novel, No One Writes to the Colonel, about an impoverished retired army officer, not unlike the author's grandfather, who waits endlessly for a letter replying to his requests for a military pension. It was published to acclaim four years later.\n\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez alternated between journalism and fiction in the late 1950s. While working for newspapers and magazines in Venezuela, he wrote a short story collection, Big Mama's Funeral, which is set in Macondo and incorporates the kind of magical elements he would master in One Hundred Years of Solitude. From 1959 to 1961 he supported the Castro revolution and wrote for Prensa Latina, the official Cuban press agency.\n\nIn 1961 he moved to Mexico City, where he would live on and off for the rest of his life. It was there, in 1965, after a four-year dry spell in which he wrote no fiction, that Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez began One Hundred Years of Solitude. The inspiration for it, he said, came to him while he was driving to Acapulco.\n\nReturning home, he began an almost undistracted 18 months of writing while his wife, Mercedes, looked after the household. \"When I was finished writing,\" he recalled, \"my wife said, 'Did you really finish it? We owe $12,000'.\" With the book's publication in 1967, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the family never owed a penny again. One Hundred Years of Solitude was sold out within days.\n\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez made no claim to have invented magic realism; he pointed out that elements of it had appeared before in Latin American literature. But no one before him had used the style with such artistry, exuberance and power. Magic realism would soon inspire writers on both sides of the Atlantic, most notably Isabel Allende in Chile and Salman Rushdie in Britain.\n\n\"Reality is also the myths of the common people,\" Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez told an interviewer. \"I realised that reality isn't just the police that kill people, but also everything that forms part of the life of the common people.\"\n\nIn 1975 he published his next novel, The Autumn of the Patriarch, about a dictator in a phantasmagorical Latin American state who rules for so many decades that nobody can recall what life was like before him. In Chronicle of a Death Foretold, published in 1981, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez used journalistic techniques to tell a story, apparently drawn from a real incident, in which the brothers of a woman who has lost her virginity murder the man responsible, Santiago Nasar.\n\nLove in the Time of Cholera, published in 1985, was Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's most romantic novel, the story of the resumption of a passionate relationship between a recently widowed septuagenarian and the lover she had broken with more than 50 years before.\n\nAs his fame grew, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez - or Gabo, as he was called by friends - enjoyed a lifestyle he would have found inconceivable in his struggling youth. He kept homes in Mexico City; Barcelona, Spain; Paris; and Cartagena, on Colombia's Caribbean coast. He dressed fastidiously, preferring a white monotone encompassing linen suits, shirts, shoes and even watchbands.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 18, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nMENTION Vietnam and the likes of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City come to mind. But Dalat? The town located 300km north-east of Ho Chi Minh City sits 1,500m above sea level and is surrounded by pine forests.\n\nIts temperate climate attracts those who are looking for a respite from the tropical heat and humidity of lower lying areas.\n\nIt is no wonder that Dalat native Le Ngoc Khanh Tam and her American lawyer husband, Barry Israel, have decided to make the highland town their home. The couple are also the developers of La Vallee de Dalat, a collection of seven luxurious single-family homes on a slope that overlooks miles of still-bucolic terrain and harks back to the glory days of Gallic design for inspiration.\n\nThey moved into their villa last year. \"We chose this location because of its view, proximity to the city centre, which is five minutes away, and because the topography is ideally suited for a secure, high-end compound for those seeking a quiet and safe environment,\" says Ms Le Tam.\n\nAccording to Ms Le Tam, Dalat has several nicknames, which are indicative of its climate and beauty. \"Some call it the Garden City because the climate is ideal for growing flowers, which are exported around the world,\" says Ms Le Tam. \"And others call it the Honeymoon Capital because it is a romantic mountain destination.\"\n\nAnd yet others call Dalat, La Petit Paris, as a result of the French architectural influence in the area. \"Barry and I wanted to build villas that are consistent with the architectural heritage of Dalat,\" says Ms Le Tam. \"We feel it is important to continue the tradition from an overall design perspective but with modern features one would expect from any high-end development.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Asiatique Design had to meet two goals, one of which was to design the villas to be consistent with the French colonial style. \"We also told them we wanted the design of the houses to funnel the residents and their guests toward the spectacular mountain and valley views,\" says Ms Le Tam. The idea is to have interiors that will pull anyone in the house towards these views. To do this, the architects designed the side of the house facing the valley and mountains to have large verandas on each level, and large windows and sliding doors opening out to the views.\n\nThe couple's 600 square metre villa comes with a master suite, three guest bedrooms and a maid's room. The main floor has a great room that runs the width of the entire house with space for a large living room and dining area. The dining area opens through a large archway into the kitchen. In addition, there is an entertainment and playroom, and a smaller room, which the couple call their cigar room, designed to be a quiet place for relaxation or to enjoy a cigar.\n\nThe interiors were designed by Mr Israel's daughter, Alison Legge, who works with design firm Pagoda House in Singapore. \"I took Alison's overall colour scheme and themes and chose from a variety of furniture, carpets and art that Barry and I have collected over the years, and from designs that our lacquer furniture factory produces for high-end clients around the world,\" says Ms Le Tam. \"Our taste is somewhat eclectic, a result of our travels and of Barry having represented clients from around the world.\"\n\nMs Le Tam cites examples of their collection of Oriental carpets that were mostly purchased in Singapore and India. The solid teak furniture in the master suite, the solid rosewood dining set and Mr Israel's office furniture were custom made in Chiang Mai. Much of the furniture was also custom-made by the couple's factory, Saigon Interiors, which produces high-end, lacquer-finished furniture and accessories for the world's top brands and retailers.\n\nArt-wise, the couple have collected plenty over the years, including hand-carved wood sculptures from the Pacific islands, and Murano crystal pieces from Venice, and a personal favourite of theirs which is a house-and-water scene made entirely out of all parts of a coconut, done by a Thai artist. Mr Israel also collects oil and watercolour paintings from the United States and Europe including works by Salvador Dali and LeRoy Neiman.\n\n\"Our collection naturally includes a number of pieces by Vietnamese artists,\" says Ms Le Tam. \"We are currently waiting for a new piece we commissioned by a young and upcoming artist, which is a pencil sketch copying a photo from the late 1920s, showing the Dalat Palace Hotel as it originally looked.\" The couple are former owners of the Dalat Palace Hotel and Dalat Palace Golf Course.\n\nApart from art, Mr Israel also has a collection of autographed sports photos of some of his heroes, including Mohammed Ali, Jackie Robinson and Sandy Koufax which he proudly displays in the cigar room.\n\nThe couple usually spends three or four days a week in Ho Chi Minh City and weekends from Wednesday or Thursday to Sunday in Dalat.\n\nOne of their favourite spots in the home is the deck off the master suite, which is the villa's highest outdoor spot. \"We like to sit here before bedtime. It is an intimate and incredibly peaceful spot that helps us relax after a hectic day,\" says Ms Le Tam.\n\nThe other is their outdoor jacuzzi, which is a great place to relax at after their game of golf.\n\n\"This is the most fun house either of us has ever lived in,\" says Ms Le Tam, adding that the views make the house. \"The mountain and sky views are constantly changing with the weather. We love sitting on one of the verandas for breakfast or late at night, just listening to the quiet and enjoying the ever-changing sky and mountain views.\"\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\n@TaySuanChiangBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

As parents of three kids ranging in age from 12 to 21 years, we have enjoyed and understand the sentimentality of important moments in our children's lives. The birth of a child is one of his/her first achievements and so how would we celebrate that? What would a really cool Jubilee Baby Gift pack contain? We believe that included in this pack should be items that are durable, memorable, unique and commemorative. Definitely one core item would be a kind of artefact which can be proudly displayed in every household, to remind both parents and kids constantly of the success of this country and the honour of being born in Singapore in such an auspicious and special year. For this we have two suggestions: One would be locally designed pewter or ceramic pieces showcasing major icons of Singapore with the inscription ''Son/Daughter of Singapore'' and ''50 Years of Independence''. To make it even more memorable and superb, the usual white and blue birth certificates for that year should come with a ''Welcome to the World, Welcome to Singapore'' note signed by none other than our PM himself. A simple gesture, but a powerful one nonetheless. As for the rest of the items, it should be things which are useful and practical. Thus we opt for vouchers for baby products, a special locally designed baby T-shirt with a ''Singapore is 50'' theme splashed all over it, and, possibly the most durable of all, a ''Singapore is 50'' aluminium water bottle.\n\nAchal Agarwal\n\nPresident - Asia Pacific Region\n\nKimberly Clark Corporation\n\nSINGAPORE represents a collage of cultures that has grown and developed over the past 50 years to be a clean, safe and happy place to live in. This has been achieved through good governance, promoting family values and racial harmony, and emphasis on education, technological advancement and innovation. For the Jubilee Baby Gift pack for Singaporean children born in 2015, I would select goodies that represent this very fabric of Singaporean society and its history. These would include:\n\n1. A cartoon book illustrated by a Singaporean representing Singapore's history over the past 50 years;\n\n2. Multi-cultural dresses to represent different ethnicities;\n\n3. A scrap book of 50 icons or milestones that represent Singapore, where parents can also record 50 milestone moments of their babies;\n\n4. A limited edition care pack of our latest Huggies diapers and baby wipes to keep the baby clean; and\n\n5. A plant that would grow alongside the baby.\n\nPhilip Brett\n\nPresident, South & Southeast Asia\n\nTBWA\\Asia Pacific\n\nGOLDEN Ticket: Newborn children are given a VIP ticket for Singapore's 100th anniversary celebrations, giving them exclusive access to the event, and showing them as being part of the nation's future.\n\nThe Jubilee Orchid: The Singapore government would commission a special orchid variant to celebrate the nation's 50th birthday, with seeds given only to children born during that year. The parents could then plant these seeds, and tend to the plant that grows alongside their jubilee babies.\n\nThe Flag of Names: The name of each child born during the 50th anniversary year would be taken down and microscopically printed and woven into a large Singapore flag, to be flown from a prominent place, such as Parliament House.\n\nBirth Gifts: For every child born in Singapore during the Jubilee year, the government would send a care package containing aid such as medicines or supplies to an underprivileged baby in another country around the world, born at the same time. The Singaporean child would be given the name and location of the child he or she is linked to, so they would be connected for life.\n\nJoshua Yim\n\nCEO\n\nAchieve Group\n\nINSTEAD of gifts that are of a monetary nature or even practical day-to-day items, I personally feel that the gift should be much more meaningful and be able to create a lasting impact on the child. A lot has been said about the younger generation being complacent and spoilt because they live in a prosperous country and have enjoyed all the creature comforts of modern society their entire life and thus take these things for granted. So with the Jubilee Baby Gift pack, I would suggest that a special package be given to the parents to take the child to visit a Third World country when he or she comes of age, say between 10 and 15 years old. This would give them exposure to how people live in undeveloped rural areas, where food and water are not easily available, for instance. I believe that witnessing such things first-hand would help in character building. The kids' attitudes will hopefully change and they will be able to appreciate how blessed they truly are to be living in Singapore. Hopefully, this could help create a generation with a stronger value system over time and, in turn, lead to a more gracious and caring society. Of course, such an initiative will cost the government a significant sum of money so perhaps a special fund can be set aside in the next Budget for this purpose.\n\nLow Lee Yong\n\nCEO\n\nMHC Asia Group Pte Ltd\n\nI WOULD like to see items that are fun, practical and that also reflect our national identity:\n\n1. Free lifetime insurance (this may be in the form of waived Medishield premiums);\n\n2. Free childhood vaccinations;\n\n3. Tickets for all the parents to attend our 50th NDP or the preview shows;\n\n4. Free yearly family photo shoot starting from birth. After 21 years, make a special album as keepsake. This is to help remind us that every family is the basic unit of Singapore society; and\n\n5. Build a national monument where the photos of all the Jubilee babies are displayed. Follow-up photos at age 21 and 50 years to be curated and displayed alongside - or more likely on a ''digital monument'' by then. There will be special significance to feature stories of their success at Singapore's 100th anniversary.\n\nShawn Balakrishnan\n\nGeneral Manager\n\nThe Hoffman Agency Singapore.\n\nI STRONGLY believe that the gifts should communicate a series of meaningful messages to the next generation on this significant milestone.\n\nThe pack should have all the right spices - our rich heritage, contributions of pioneer generations, as well as the hopes and aspirations of our nation - and inculcate our core values of care, integrity, teamwork, imagination, courage, excellence and service to our nation.\n\nTherefore, the five items I'd pick would include a bedtime storybook, containing short significant stories on the history of Singapore. Second, a baby blanket with our national flower ''Vanda Miss Joaquim Orchid'' as its motif. Third, baby building blocks with alphabets linked to iconic Singapore landmarks. Fourth, a painting done by young artists from one of our local art institutions. And a baby mobile with three-dimensional depiction of local animals and motifs that would hang overhead with sweet songs that would put a smile on any child's face.\n\nI believe the items chosen for the Jubilee Baby Gift Pack should represent birthday gifts to a child on his/her birthday.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPLAN-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\n(and ex-chairman of the National Family Council)\n\nIF I have to pick five items for the Jubilee Baby Gift pack, it would have to be a blanket (to keep the baby warm), a baby hat (to protect the baby from the sun), a set of bowl and spoon (for feeding), a bag to contain most of the items, and to top it off with a SG50 certificate signed by a minister, if not our Prime Minister. All items must have the SG50 logo to enhance their significance and commemorative value. A common denominator in my choice of items is their durability and utilisation value. If they are intended to be gifts, why not go the extra mile to make them novelties of lasting usefulness and value. All the proposed items can be used for several years. They would also be items of memorabilia when they are no longer useful. I would contend that since they are commemorative items in celebration of SG50, their value as memorabilia far outweighs their intrinsic ones. Singapore faces a declining fertility rate. A certificate signed by a Minister, if not our PM, to recognise a newborn in 2015 as an SG50 baby is another opportune time for the government to show our appreciation to Singaporean married couples for helping us to tackle our population challenge. Although a simple gesture, its historical value is immense. 2015 may well turn out to be another ''Year of the Dragon'' as we celebrate SG50.\n\nVenkatraman Sheshashayee\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nJaya Holdings Ltd\n\nI APPRECIATE the efforts of the Singapore50 Committee to make this Jubilee truly special. It is wonderful to see how all Singaporeans are coming together to give ideas on how we can make Singapore's 50th birthday year one that will live in our memories forever.\n\nFor the Jubilee Baby Gift pack, may I suggest something slightly different?\n\nEvery baby born in Singapore, regardless of the year of birth, is fortunate. He or she will be well cared for, will grow up in a secure environment, have access to great schools, enjoy the world's best infrastructure, and can look forward to a rewarding and exciting future.\n\nInstead of a Jubilee Baby Gift pack, may I suggest that the government set up a bank account for every child born in the Fifth Decade of Singapore's life, with an ''angel deposit'' that will help lay the foundation for the child's learning and understanding of the management and growth of wealth? This account and deposit could, in future years, be topped up to commemorate significant events and important achievements, by the child's parents and relatives, the community the child lives in, or even the government. See it as building up a fund that the child will access when he or she turns 16 or 18. This fund could become a college fund, or a building fund, or even help with entrepreneurial aspirations.\n\nSuch a gift will, in my opinion, both celebrate today and help our children prepare for tomorrow.\n\nChris Comer\n\nCEO and Property Developer\n\nCastlewood Group\n\nA Special ''50th Anniversary of Singapore'' birth certificate depicting (around the border) national historical milestones.\n\nA commemorative Singapore dollar coin minted in 2015.\n\nA copy of the 50th anniversary edition of The Straits Times , in a commemorative presentation package\n\nAn engraved silver frame with a photo of the Prime Minister with a personalised message to the newborn child.\n\nA digital storage medium that will stand the test of time loaded with the Channel News Asia documentary ''Days of Rage''.\n\nFor the nostalgia of being born in the year of the nation's 50th birthday, these items should become treasured heirlooms to be passed on from generation to generation. The documentary offers an unrivalled look back at the major events that shaped Singapore to be the country that it is today, showing relationships with its neighbours in the mid-20th century; this could be loaded with other commemorative documentaries produced to depict the birth and life of the nation.\n\nNirvik Singh\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nGrey Group Asia Pacific\n\nCELEBRATING the 50th year of Singapore's independence and the birth of the 2015 Singaporean babies, we should always remember the road Singapore has gone on to reach today. Let's include nostalgic items which Singapore had grown up with such as the iconic Good Morning towel which can be used as a bath towel; the trustworthy 555 Notebook as a baby log book; and the BM2000 Bata school shoes (kids' size).\n\nNot forgetting the hardworking parents too, an OSIM massager would be a great gift to help in tackling the everyday stress.\n\nLast but not least, we should not forget the history of Singapore. Mr Lee Kuan Yew's books on the tribulations and upheavals of Singapore's past 50 years will be an excellent lesson to the next generation not to take things for granted.\n\nPatrick Liew\n\nManaging Partner\n\nGlobal Enterprise Exchange\n\nI HOPE the gift pack will reinforce what is key to bringing up a child - the joy of parenting. It makes all the challenges worth it and, in fact, it is part of the meaning and fulfilment of having a nuclear family.\n\nIn line with this value, it would be good to include a video camera and camcorder and a specially designed photo album, a scrap book, or a digital photo frame album. They serve to capture wonderful memories for the child and help strengthen family bonds.\n\nLet's have a social media site with proper admin control so that parents can share their parenting joy, engage with one another, and provide support to each other. It can also have other resources to enhance the joy of parenting.\n\nA coffee table book should be provided with parenting tips, including ideas on how to bring more fun, laughter and excitement to the family.\n\nLast but not least, provide a gift voucher. The parents should know best what they need as they start the wonderful journey of bringing up a child.\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nPERSONALLY, I'm not in favour of Singapore spending huge sums of money for the Jubilee Baby Gift pack, as I feel such resources could be put to better uses such as alleviating the financial burden of the underprivileged and low-income families in our society. However, if such a gift pack needs to be created and given out, it should not only be commemorative but very practical too, in the hope that it may help boost Singapore's fertility rate, which was 1.19 last year, below the replacement rate of 2.1. For example, babies born in 2015 could be entitled to much higher subsidies for childcare fees, a bigger ''Baby Bonus'', and perhaps even a special bonus every five years until age 20, to be paid directly into the child's CPF Ordinary or Medisave account for future medical and retirement needs. The gift pack could also contain a booklet of vouchers that offer significant savings for parents in the purchase of necessities such as milk powder, diapers and other needful paraphernalia such as baby cots and prams. As for commemorative gifts, perhaps each baby could receive a cast of the baby's footprint along with a certificate or plaque with a special inscription and serial number to mark his or her place in history.\n\nSam Yap\n\nGroup Executive Chairman and Co-Founder\n\nHtwo Investment Holdings Pte Ltd\n\nTHE Jubilee Baby Gift pack is something special for Jubilee Babies, on top of what other babies would get under various existing population policy schemes and initiatives, such as the Baby Bonus.\n\nThe five items I would choose would be:\n\n1. A commemorative gold coin with a short writeup on the significance of the event;\n\n2. A specially commissioned story book on the history of Singapore and its first 50 years, for the parents to read to their children as they grow up. It can be written with young children in mind, with colourful illustrations. This will give the children a true account of our history and encourage bonding, interaction and learning at a young age;\n\n3. A gift voucher of a reasonable amount for parents to purchase baby products and supplies at a few selected stores. This is a practical gift and will help parents to defray some of the costs of raising young children;\n\n4. A Savings Plan Scheme or a Trust Fund Scheme with the premiums partly paid for by the government and parents paying a token sum. This can be cashed out when the Jubilee babies turn 18. The resources can then be used for the children's further education or a youth entrepreneurship project; and\n\n5. A voucher scheme for the parents to participate in various enrichment talks on parenting, childcare and development over a period of two to three years. The vouchers can be used at certain vendors or service providers. Such opportunities for parents will make them better aware of issues and concerns surrounding raising happy and balanced children and understanding their roles, responsibilities and the challenges in the education and care of young children.\n\nDora Hoan\n\nCo-Chairman/Group CEO\n\nBest World International Ltd\n\nI WOULD pick a gold pendant with SG50 engraved on it; a hongbao of $5,000 cash; a hamper of sponsored baby products; an SG50 baby album and special SG50 baby toys. The Golden Jubilee should be a time to remember; what else can make it a more lasting memory than a gold pendant? Of course, we must not forget about the mothers who put in around 10 months of effort for the babies to arrive. So, the gift packs can be the babies' gifts to their mummies and what can be more practical than cash and assorted baby products and toys? After all the hard work, they deserve to relax and take their minds off the financial matters at least for a short time.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That gulf between the \"consumer app\" and enterprise app is about to close.\n\nAs a result, Avanade is investing an \"amazing amount\" into user interface design in order to build \"human interfaces\" for clients, said Mr Slattery.\n\nAvanade is a joint venture company co-owned by Microsoft and consultancy company Accenture.\n\nFounded in 2000, it now has 21,500 employees globally, and generally provides IT consultancy services based on Microsoft's technology to large multinational clients.\n\nIan Jordan, Avanade's Asia-Pacific president, noted that the user interface department has been growing in the region in response to rising demand from clients here. Avanade has hundreds of user interface designers working on apps for clients globally.\n\n\"Three to four years ago I wouldn't have expected us to hire 'experience' designers,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to redesigning desktop apps, more companies are investing in building mobile versions of their enterprise software, thanks to demand from users who want to work on the go, he said.\n\nWith that comes new considerations in how to present these apps for the best productivity gains.\n\n\"Companies are trying to figure out, do I want one big app or many small, single-purpose apps? There are new ways of thinking about it. Smaller apps are catching on in interest, for sure,\" he said.\n\nThese trends are happening across many verticals, even with industrial companies, said Florin Rotar, Avanade's chief technology innovation officer.\n\nHe highlighted one of Avanade's clients - Swedish construction firm NCC, which built a tablet app to allow workers in the field to enter data. Managers can view the findings post- analysis after the data goes through a business intelligence tool.\n\n\"NCC did this because they wanted to attract new workers coming out of school,\" Mr Rotar said. Demand is coming from \"a new generation that is not putting up with the old style\" of enterprise applications.\n\nIt's time companies paid attention to user interface design, given that businesses have long known how important it is to e-commerce.\n\nAccording to the latest Avanade customer study, 56 per cent of companies reported being willing to pay up to 30 per cent more because they had a positive buying experience.\n\nAnd 80 per cent of companies surveyed said they changed at least one business process in the past three years in order to interact better with customers.\n\n\"This is how we see technology evolving. Companies are all trying to redesign work interfaces to fuel better collaboration and productivity within,\" said Mr Slattery.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

How about a human hotel where the cat in charge decides if he wants to greet you or lounge around in an empty banquet hall, arching his neck to show off his Goyard collar?\n\nBut you're not totally ignored as there are enough humans to take care of your needs in the quietly elegant Hotel Bristol on Paris's chi-chi Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore.\n\nClose enough to the main drag of Champs Elysee without being part of the touristy hustle and bustle, Le Bristol has long been the hangout of the discreet who's who. But it has also attracted enough well-heeled regular folk who liked it enough to vote it the best hotel in France in Trip Advisor Traveller's Choice 2014. Classified as a \"Palace Hotel\", Le Bristol served its first guests in 1925 when owner Hippolyte Jamet set out to create Paris's most luxurious hotel in keeping with its gentrified surroundings where saddle maker Hermes and dressmaker Jean Lanvin set up their first shops. As more big fashion names moved in, Rue du Fauborg Saint-Honore became the ultra-luxe street in Paris, while Le Bristol became a magnet for celebrities such as Kim Novak and Charlie Chaplin.\n\nIn 1978, the hotel was acquired by the German Oetker family - they of the popular frozen Dr Oetker pizzas. Since then, it's been through several makeovers and extensions, upping the luxury ante each time. It's also changed cute mascots - from the fluffy garden rabbit named Hippolyte to current pampered house cat Fa-raon, who's a hot favourite with both kids and adults.\n\nHe is of course not the only celebrity in the hotel. Helming the three Michelin-starred restaurant Epicure is Chef Eric Frechon who pulls off elaborate meals for those who want the full dining experience. If not, follow the elegant lunch crowd to the one-starred 114 Faubourg, where Chef Eric Desbordes shows off proficient brasserie fare such as creamy artichoke soup with minced black truffle and foie gras.\n\nBut what really seals the deal is when you finish dinner at a fancy French restaurant and ask them to call you a cab to take you back to the hotel. When the ma\u00eetre d asks where you're staying, you can see his eyebrows rise conspicuously as he then smiles approvingly. And when your cab pulls up in front of the hotel entrance, you can truly say you've arrived - in more ways than one.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Cheah Ui-Hoon\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 18, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nHAVING heard how difficult it is to pair chocolates with wine, oenologist John Wade signed up for a short course, and within six months, exchanged his 40-year wine-making career for a new one in chocolate.\n\nHe migrated over from wines to the \"dark side\" as it were, and named his chocolate atelier accordingly.\n\n\"But there's not a lot of difference between winemaking and chocolate making - it's all about flavour, balance, structure, and using good raw ingredients,\" shares the grandfatherly-looking chocolatier with white hair and a well-trimmed beard.\n\nDarkside Chocolates, on the main street of Denmark, a coastal town in the Great Southern region of Western Australia (WA), is an unassuming store with a simple shopfront. Glass cabinets are filled with trays of chocolate, and the flavours are very unique with a strong local South Australian emphasis. There's Shiraz and Sauvignon Blanc in his wine-filled chocolates, then of course there's lemon myrtle-flavoured chocs (which is very similar to lemongrass except it's fuller bodied and more rounded) and even some filled with blue cheese.\n\nArtisanal stores like Darkside (\n\nwww.darksidechocolates.com.au\n\n), with a strong emphasis on homegrown, homemade products, is one key reason to enjoy a slow drive around Albany and Denmark - just over 400km from Perth or a couple of hours' drive beyond WA's Margaret River, the traditional go-to place for a gourmet and wine-tasting holiday when you're spending a long weekend in Western Australia.\n\nAlbany (and that would be pronounced as \"el\" rather than \"ahl\") is a worthy contender to Margaret River, even if it's a longish (three to four hours) drive or a short plane ride (one hour) out of Perth.\n\nOur media familiarisation group, hosted by Tourism Western Australia, was flown to Albany and we soon knew we had landed in small town Australia, where places are less design-led but full of heart.\n\nWe didn't exactly find out what the main industry here is, but it certainly seems like everyone and their dog is into wine or some wholesome food business and they're all located in picturesque farms, orchards and wineries. When we arrived on a Saturday morning, our Busy Blue Bus (\n\nwww.busybluebus.com.au\n\n) took us straight from the airport to the Albany Farmer's Market held weekly, where I sunk my teeth into a corn cob, at its sweetest and crunchiest when raw.\n\nA visit to the historical Princess Royal Fortress and Military Museum later (mainly for military history buffs, and there's the Anzac Centenary coming up later this year in November), we were trundling along straight and winding country roads to places like the Oranje Tractor winery (www.oranjetractor.com) for a lovely tasting of organic wines and the famed ploughman's platter filled with organic vegetables and products. At Singlefile Wines (\n\nwww.singlefilewines.com\n\n), the feel and look is less rustic, but no less charming as you quaff glasses of wine underneath a portico covered with grapevines.\n\nWinery after winery we visited, the story that emerged was that of Australians breaking away from faster-paced city lives to tap into their inner agriculturists in Albany and Denmark. Former Perth couple, Garry Capelli and Leanne Rogers of The Lake House, had been holidaying for more than a decade in Denmark when they decided to up their stakes and move there, fulfilling their dream of purchasing 100 acres of land and a lake.\n\nWith little experience or knowledge, but armed with business skills, they built up a winery, boutique stay, a range of vino dips and sauces, and even a range of winespa products (\n\nwww.lakehousedenmark.com.au\n\n).\n\nWe didn't just eat our way through Albany and Denmark of course - we didn't have time - but did the requisite outdoorsy stuff that's available in the area like wandering over a rocky granite outcrop at Torndirrup National Park to witness a natural bridge shaped by crashing waves; an exhilarating, exerting climb at Porongurup Range National Park for the three-kilometre return Granite Walk; and a gentler trek to explore the unique tall tingle forest at the Valley of the Giants's Treetop Walk (\n\nhttp://parks.dpaw.wa.gov.au/site/tree-top-walk\n\n).\n\nWhat we thoroughly enjoyed though, after a charming stay at The Dog Rock Motel in Albany (\n\nwww.dogrockmotel.com.au\n\n), is the modern bungalow we stayed in, managed by Cape Howe Cottages (\n\nwww.capehowe.com.au\n\n), which is a real luxurious place in the middle of, well, nowhere with tall trees and bush all around.\n\nLonely Planet listed Australia's south-west region as one of the world's Top Ten regions in 2010, and it looks like it well deserves the recognition - as places like Albany and Denmark are carving out a niche for themselves as a rustic, artisanal retreat.\n\nTime your visit around:\n\nWhile you're in Perth, check out these two off-the-beaten-track tours:\n\nuihoon@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its women's line, Blake & Co, and graphic tees for men, 9fountains, are sold to online retailers such as Zalora in Singapore and Pomelo.com in Thailand. The company also sells to physical retailers across the region, and in Singapore, its clothing is carried at several stores down at Orchard Road.\n\nCo-founder and creative director at Lift12, Andrew Wolf, told BizIT that the startup has devised a methodology to zero in on clothing with the best potential to sell, create those and push them quickly out of the warehouse.\n\nAll of this is based on patterns and trend data coming out of catwalks and refined by buyer behaviour. For Blake & Co's, for instance, Lift12's in-house designer is fed crucial information that will give her a \"framework of success\" within which she can work, said Mr Wolf. The company collects data such as which products are on the front pages of fashion sites and e-commerce pages.\n\nSocial media data such as images and hashtags are trawled and processed. \"You will see different demand trends, and different sizes for different geographies, for example. Some markets prefer dresses, so we'll do more of that. This is pulled into the design process and helps us mitigate some risk on the inventory side, so that we aren't left with a pile of unpopular sizes as well,\" he explained.\n\nWith this, the company is able to release new collections on a six-to-eight-week cycle, beating the average market pace by two to three times, it claims.\n\nThe fast-release cycle is especially important today, because contemporary fast fashion giants such as Zara and H&M turn out new designs off the catwalk as quickly as they can, in order to capture buyers' tastes.\n\nThe company hopes that its learnings based on data crunched will help it replicate some of the processes that have brought success to these larger brands.\n\nThe idea for the platform came from Mr Wolf's early interactions with Gon\u00e7alo Reis, with whom he later co-founded Lift12. Mr Reis was working with e-commerce player, Zalora, and the two met because 9fountains was one of the brands listed on Zalora.\n\nThe two realised that the tees were selling well based on 9fountains' quick response to buying trends. Each month, more tees similar to the best sellers would come from the supplier, and that reaction time was different from other brands, said Mr Reis. He said: \"The composition of the collections is more and more focused each time. Initially, we had seven colours, but black and white tees make up 60 per cent of sales. So we kept testing pricing and design trends against the data.\"\n\nHaving raised a seed round of $700,000 from Singapore-based venture capital firm Silicon Straits in September last year, Lift12 is looking to raise another smaller pool of $300,000 before a larger Series A fund-raising effort at the end of the year.\n\nThe Series A round is Silicon Valley lingo for a startup's first significant round of funding, and usually comes after angel and seed funding.\n\nMr Reis said that the next lump sum is intended to help it churn out sufficient inventory for the growing number of retailers it's working with. He claims that the company is moving towards breaking even soon, already quite uncommon among startups, which often don't focus on profitability so early on. The company is already delivering around 50 per cent net profit, he noted. But the two co-founders' plans don't stop there. If they successfully raise a Series A at the end of the year, 2015 will see Lift12 plunging headlong into a direct consumer model, where margins are much higher than they are for B2B (business to business).\n\nThat step will take far more resources, said Mr Wolf. Going direct to consumers involves much more money spent on marketing, customer service and developing a robust front-end for its website, for instance.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

OCBC's loan book in London has fattened about five times since 2010, given the interest in residential and commercial properties from Singapore developers.\n\nCommercial properties in London command a 5-per cent yield. \"In the context of Singapore, it's very attractive,\" Mr Lee said, noting that commercial properties here have a yield of about 3 per cent.\n\nAlso, commercial leases in London can stretch up to 15 years, compared to a typical three-year rental agreement in Singapore - a source of comfort to developers, added Mr Lee.\n\nInterest is strong in Australia too, where commercial yield is even higher at about 6 per cent, he said.\n\nListed property developers in Singapore have announced plans to expand into these two markets, given pressures on home ground.\n\nHiap Hoe said in February that it would continue its expansion into Australia, having bought an investment property in Perth. In the same month, Heeton Holdings said that it plans to refurbish its recent London purchase, the Enterprise Hotel.\n\nMr Lee expects more construction loans from these two markets - seeing the same growth in absolute-number terms this year - though he noted that these loans are a fraction of the bank's overall loan book. OCBC has the second-largest construction loan book in Singapore after DBS. It booked about $25 billion in building loans last year, up 11 per cent over the year.\n\nProperty developers in Singapore see \"intense competition and sluggishness in the market\", said Mr Lee. Besides fending off competition from Chinese and Malaysian developers, property firms here have had their margins squeezed by the government's cooling measures.\n\n\"Given these dynamics, there is an impetus to go overseas,\" said Mr Lee.\n\nWhile navigating unfamiliar territory, smaller property firms from Singapore and the region hold an ace in hand when negotiating joint-venture deals with foreign developers.\n\nBy bringing in a Singapore bank such as OCBC to the table, these developers offer a valuable credit line from Asian lenders when Western banks, particularly those from London, are shying from construction loans as they repair their balance sheets, said Mr Lee.\n\nHotel Properties sealed one such partnership with London developer Native Land and Malaysia's Amcorp Properties in 2012 to acquire an office building in London for \u00a385 million (S$178.8 million) for redevelopment.\n\nMalaysian developers have played the same hand. A consortium made up of the Employees' Pension Fund of Malaysia, SP Setia and Sime Darby, snagged a 400-million pound bid for London's Battersea Power Station in 2012, beating Chelsea Football Club, which planned to build a new stadium there.\n\nMuch attention has been drawn to the project, since the site of the idle building - which was featured on a Pink Floyd album cover - will be designed by famed architect Frank Gehry.\n\nThe site will become a residential area, with the redevelopment plans backed by funding from Asian banks such as CIMB Group, OCBC, and Maybank.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Participants will form and build ideas in teams and then pitch their prototypes - a mobile app or website - to a panel of judges.\n\nTo facilitate this, the foursome behind BR4C will be teaching participants the skills needed to build their prototype, such as programming and coding methodologies as well as user interface practices.\n\nAbout 50 participants from secondary schools, junior colleges, polytechnics and even international schools have signed up for the event which will be held at HubQuarters@*SCAPE, a dedicated co-working space for youths to develop their entrepreneurial ideas.\n\n\"It's excellent that BR4C is targeting participants in this age group, many of whom are still deciding on their plans for study after high school. The event will help 'demystify' what is required for building apps and running technology businesses, and plant the idea of technopreneurship in their heads,\" Michael Brown, associate professor and vice-dean at the National University of Singapore's School of Computing, tells The Business Times.\n\nDr Brown is one of the judges at Technovation Youth 2014. Fellow judges and guest speakers agreed that the event would benefit Singapore's startup ecosystem in the long run.\n\n\"One of the reasons Silicon Valley is successful is that youths have early access to entrepreneurship communities. They meet entrepreneurs every day and thus feel that starting a business is normal and not a crazy thing to do. What our students need are similar opportunities,\" says Kyaw Lin Oo, founder-CEO of online event management platform EventNook.\n\nSuch events, if held regularly, will ensure that the ecosystem will continually have inquisitive minds and fresh solutions, says Nityanand Rai, co-founder of lifestyle education portal Twofold. \"In the long run, just knowing that there are such events will encourage our youth to explore computers beyond gaming and media devices, and actually create products that will solve real world problems.\"\n\nAside from Mr Chan, the other co-founders of BR4C are Rameez Remsudeen, 17, Muhammad Hisyam Bin Jukifli, 18, and Rachelle Yee, 19.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By May Yip\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 18, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nNOW that Jennifer Aniston has embraced the ancient treatment of cupping, while \"going Paleo\" actually applies to a diet rather than an insult for those prone to imbecility, it's no surprise that the age-old practice of aromatherapy has made a comeback. Today, essential oils are regarded way more seriously than overpriced air fresheners. In fact, they have been adopted to aid counselling sessions, promote concentration and even fend off an outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease. Too good to be true? Try telling that to legions of devotees, and businesses with a nose for aromatherapy's lucrative potential.\n\n\"The recent increase in the use of essential oils is definitely in sync with the growing interest of people in search of a lifestyle improvement, thinking healthier and wanting natural products to live with,\" says Will Halterman, South-east Asia general manager of Young Living Singapore. \"This growing trend is most prominently seen in cities such as Singapore where a stressful and busy work life is seemingly unavoidable.\"\n\nYoung Living is perhaps the biggest success story for the practice, which can be traced back to the use of incenses by the ancient Egyptians in honour of their deities. The US-founded network marketing company retails pure essential oils cultivated and distilled on farms in locations such as Ecuador, France, Oman and the US. Sales have grown a mindboggling 816 per cent since it started its office in Singapore almost three years ago.\n\nAnother aromatherapy company that has been making plenty of cents from natural scents is homegrown chain Mt Sapola. After successful forays into 12 countries, including the US, UK and Bahrain, the group has recently made its debut in Taiwan, 17 years after former civil servant Cheryl Gan decide to pursue her passion for naturopathic aromatherapy.\n\nStarting out as a company selling natural handmade soaps in Thailand, Ms Gan opened her first store here in 2007, and witnessed a huge demand for aromatherapy products. With already 10 stores in Singapore, she plans to add six more outlets to her aromatic empire by the end of this year. She also attributes the rise of alternative therapies such as traditional Chinese medicine, osteopathy and chiropracty to the greater acceptance and availability of aromatherapy.\n\n\"One interesting insight that we received is that the demand for 'natural' and 'ecological' products in body care and food industries has moved from a niche area to a booming market in the recent years,\" says the IT engineering graduate. \"People are more concerned about the increasing use of powerful medical drugs and their side effects, information is easily available with the access of Internet, and consumers are therefore better informed and are more willing to try alternative therapies, especially the use of natural remedies.\"\n\nThat said, conclusive studies on the subject have been limited, one reason being that it's impossible to implement blind tests, since participants are able to whiff out essential oils from placebos. According to Eugene Tay, a psychologist and programme director at PsycHealth Practice, it remains unclear if aromatherapy is effective as a medical intervention in treating conditions such as depression, anxiety or stress-related symptoms. Nevertheless, its other benefits appear promising: inhaling lavender essential oils have been shown to help reduce some symptoms associated with dementia, especially that of restlessness; while another study found that the use of rosemary and lemon helped with cognitive functions in elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease, according to Mr Tay.\n\n\"Within my practice, I use various essential oils as they bring forth a sense of tranquility and concentration,\" says Mr Tay, who is drawn to working with patients experiencing mood-related disorders. \"Some of the common oils used to help focus are that of peppermint or a blend of rosemary with lemon. Usually in my counselling sessions, I diffuse lavender or eucalyptus as they provide a pleasantly delicate scent, which seem to calm nerves and help clients feel more relaxed.\"\n\nSuch mood-enhancing benefits of aromatherapy has led to a host of beauty companies incorporating essential oils in their products. Australian-founded brand Aesop, for example, has enjoyed a strong following in part thanks to its fragrant concoctions such as the best-selling Resurrection Aromatique Hand Balm, infused with botanicals such as rosemary, cedarwood and lavender. It has also recently launched a marketing campaign called Aesop Nasotheque in Australia to draw attention to all things olfactory - from offering \"nose casts\" of customers' sniffers' at certain stores, to an online initiative tracing the historical and cultural associations with the sense of smell.\n\nAnd apart from adding an evocative edge to skincare, essential oils are finding their way into medicine cabinets. The purest extracts - which don't come cheap at sometimes over $50 a pop, are attractive alternatives to synthetic drugs and supplements for modern-day mums, eager to try out more natural treatments on their kids.\n\n\"The first oil I used on my children was Young Living Thieves essential oil and now it's an oil I absolutely can't imagine my life (or their lives) without,\" says Tania Boh, a mother of three who is an aromatherapy devotee. \"I apply it on the soles of their feet every morning before they go to school, after school and before they sleep to keep them protected from bugs in school or public places.\"\n\nA blend of several essential oils including that of cloves and rosemary, the highly popular Thieves Oil is believed by others to support the immune system, and even reduce the duration of certain viruses such as hand, foot and mouth disease, although there isn't any scientific evidence of its efficacy. So is this enthusiasm for oils just another hippy-dippy novelty, or a movement that's here to stay?\n\n\"Essential oils have been around for thousands of years, and were even used in ancient Egyptian times,\" elaborates Mr Halterman. \"And if aromatherapy is something that you can utilise to simply reduce stress, or soothe your body and mind, isn't it already a benefit? Would it then require any further scientific backing to prove that it relieves stress if you feel more relaxed?\"\n\nProbably not, especially if debating the effects of oils in itself would cause much unnecessary stress.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In month-on-month terms, prices rose 0.2 per cent in March, slowing from February's rise of 0.3 per cent.\n\nAnalysts said the cooling of the property market is an initial indication of stabilisation and they expect the easing trend to continue this year.\n\n\"Home price rises will continue to lose momentum this year as we have seen more developers start to cut prices,\" said Liu Yuan, a research head of property consultancy Centaline in Shanghai. \"However, we think the market will finally stabilise, thanks to still strong demand and local governments' possible moves to ease restrictions on home buying.\"\n\nThe property market has lost steam since late 2013 as the authorities tightened controls on speculative buying, and as banks made it harder for home buyers and small developers to get loans.\n\nThere have been other indications of weakness in the sector, such as falling investment and slowing gains in land prices, raising some concern that the sector is becoming a risk to the government's engineered slowdown of the economy. The government has spent more than four years trying to tame record home prices on concerns that they were stoking an asset bubble, and some see the efforts bearing fruit.\n\nBut too sharp a fall in a sector that supports some 40 other industries, ranging from cement to furniture, may set off alarm bells about potential bad debt and drag further on the economy, which marked its slowest growth pace in 18 months in the first quarter.\n\nThe NBS data showed home prices rose year on year in 69 of the 70 cities monitored, unchanged from February. Wenzhou, a centre for private businesses, was the only city where house prices fell in March, dropping 3.9 per cent from a year ago.\n\nOn a month-on-month basis, four cities, including Wenzhou and Haikou in the far south, saw home prices drop, while 10 cities, including Hangzhou and Ningbo, saw prices unchanged from the previous month, the NBS said. Price gains also eased in the country's wealthiest cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, but the four still saw double-digit year-on-year growth.\n\nOfficial data on Wednesday showed marked decelerations in property investment and sales and a contraction in housing starts in the first quarter.

However, the prospect of large job cuts at Alitalia and the airline's debt of at least 800 million euros have been major hurdles in the talks.\n\n\"The position of the Arab group has hardened; some problems have been more markedly underlined than before,\" one of the sources said.\n\nA government source, however, said that Etihad's tougher position could be overcome. \"The government is counting on finding a solution,\" the source said.\n\nItalian Infrastructure Minister Maurizio Lupi told parliament that Etihad had sent a letter to Alitalia on April 16 to set out its conditions for a possible investment.\n\nMr Lupi said it is up to the company's private shareholders - which include Alitalia's creditors Intesa Sanpaolo and UniCredit - to respond.\n\nItalian daily Il Messaggero reported last Thursday that a deal between the two airlines was off because the conditions were not in place, but the sources denied the talks had collapsed.\n\n\"It's part of negotiations . . . It in no way means the deal is over. They have just put tough conditions on the deal,\" a United Arab Emirates- based source said.\n\nAn Etihad spokesman declined to comment. Alitalia also declined to comment.\n\nEtihad chief executive officer James Hogan held talks with Italy's Prime Minister Matteo Renzi earlier this month. A source with knowledge of the talks said at the time that Etihad was considering investing up to 500 million euros in Alitalia and was inching towards an offer.\n\nOut of that investment, 350 million euros would be for a 49 per cent stake in the Italian airline, the source said.\n\nHowever, the source also said that one of the conditions put forward by the Gulf airline was for 2,000 job cuts out of Alitalia's 14,000-strong workforce. Italian media have reported demands for bigger cuts, with Il Messaggero on Thursday citing 3,000.\n\n\"Things are a bit stalled, mainly because of job-related problems.

With a core Tier 1 capital ratio of 10 per cent at end-December under tougher Basel III rules, the bank has transformed its balance sheet.\n\nThe Asian contribution to the group's CIB business is understood to be about 15-20 per cent.\n\nIn Asia, Societe Generale wants to go beyond transactional banking, to strengthen relationships with clients and is willing to commit more capital to lending, said Mr Lambert.\n\nFollowing the 2011 European crisis, many European banks reduced their operations, so while Societe Generale did shrink its financing activities due to de-leveraging, its trade finance business did not suffer, he said.\n\n\"We are one of the top three houses for commodity trade finance, it didn't suffer from de-leveraging,\" said Mr Lambert.\n\nTrade finance is basically short-term in nature, with loan maturities of six to 12 months and the bank was \"always able to commit significant balance sheet to this\", he said.\n\nThe bank focuses on commodities such as oil and gas, metals and coal.\n\n\"We never lost market share; we might have consolidated our market position,\" he said.\n\nThe bank increased its balance sheet by 10-20 per cent to support the trade finance business from last year, Mr Lambert noted.\n\nAnother core strength is in structured products and equity derivatives.\n\nLast year, Societe Generale bought out Credit Agricole's 50 per cent stake in Newedge, their commonly owned joint-venture focused on derivatives brokerage, making it a wholly owned unit.\n\nWith 100 per cent owned Newedge, the bank can fully service institutional clients such as hedge funds. Newedge provides a wide range of trade and post trade services to institutional and corporate clients, in particular through execution and clearing services on listed options and futures contracts on fixed income, foreign exchange, equities and commodities and on over-the-counter markets.\n\nThe CIB team in Singapore employs about 200 people and this may grow to 220 in the next two years.\n\nThe commodity trade finance desk has about 20 staff and another 15 in commodity derivatives.\n\nMr Lambert, who was appointed to his current role in September 2012, said that the big push last year was in North Asia. But this year will see more attention on South-east Asia and China, and deeper involvement in fixed income and project financing.\n\n\"We believe South-east Asia is our big push this year,\" he said.\n\nSociete Generale is a major project finance player on a global scale. In 2012, the bank acted as the mandated lead arranger for the integrated Ichthys LNG (liquefied natural gas) project in Australia, the largest energy project financing globally to date. The total debt is US$20 billion comprising of Export Credit Agency (ECA) direct loans, ECA covered loans, commercial bank uncovered and sponsor loans.\n\nLast year, Societe Generale was the mandated lead arranger for the US$5 billion financing and construction of the Nghi Son Refinery & Petrochemical Refinery complex in Vietnam.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The second capital hike, for 370 million euros, would be part of Hapag-Lloyd's planned debut on the stock market. Vapores will contribute 259 million euros to the first capital increase and end up with a 34 per cent stake in Hapag-Lloyd.\n\nShipping groups have been struggling through the worst slump on record, as they grapple with low freight rates brought by overcapacity and a weak global economy. No 1 carrier Maersk Line, a unit of AP Moller-Maersk, Switzerland-based MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company and France's CMA CGM, have agreed to set up a three-way alliance that could control more than a third of the market. Vapores, majority-owned by the billionaire Luksic family, Chile's richest, has been battling steep losses caused by low freight rates, high fuel prices and expensive leases.\n\nThe business combination is subject to approval by the City of Hamburg's Senate by April 30. Also, according to the terms of the deal, if more than 5 per cent of Vapores' total shareholders exercise withdrawal rights by April 20, the deal will be annulled.\n\nIt is not the first time Hapag-Lloyd, the world's No 5 container shipping company by capacity and burdened by 2.35 billion euros of net debt, has sought expansion through mergers, but deals have proved elusive. Last year, it held talks with German peer Hamburg-Sued over a deal but the parties were unable to agree on terms.\n\nTravel group TUI holds a 22 per cent stake in Hapag-Lloyd and said that that would drop to 13.9 per cent as a result of Hapag-Lloyd's tie-up with Vapores. TUI will not participate in the planned capital increase. TUI, which has long planned to exit shipping to focus solely on tourism, will get priority placement rights for its remaining stake as part of Hapag-Lloyd's planned stock market flotation in 2015, it said in an internal letter, seen by Reuters.

A clearer picture started to emerge of the time around the capsize with the release by coastguards of a conversation between vessel controllers and the ship.\n\nWitnesses have said that the Sewol turned sharply before it began listing. It is still not clear why the vessel turned. It took more than two hours for it to capsize completely, but passengers were ordered to stay put in their cabins.\n\nAccording to the transcript, at 9.25 am, the controllers told 69-year old Captain Lee Joon-seok to \"decide how best to evacuate the passengers\" and that he should \"make the final decision on whether or not to evacuate\".\n\nCaptain Lee was not on the bridge when the ship turned. Navigation was in the hands of a 26-year old third mate who was in charge for the first time in the passage, according to crew members.\n\nThe transcript shows that crew on the ship worried that there were not enough rescue boats at the scene to take on all the passengers. Witnesses said that the captain and some crew members took to rescue boats before the passengers.\n\nCaptain Lee said earlier he feared that passengers would be swept away by the ferocious currents if they leapt into the sea, but he has not explained why he left the vessel.\n\nProsecutor Yang Joong-jin told a news conference in Mokpo, one of the centres for the investigation, that some of the crew said they had not received any safety training. \"We are trying to find out if there is additional negligence,\" Mr Yang told a news conference in Mokpo, one of the centres for the investigation, speaking of the captain and crew.\n\nWhen the captain and two crew members were arrested on Saturday, they were detained by police for 10 days and prosecutors for a further 10. If the new extension request is granted, they could be detained for 30 days. Mr Yang said that prosecutors had also summoned 10 other people to give evidence, including other crew members from the Sewol and officials from the ferry's owner, Chonghaejin Marine Co Ltd.\n\nMore divers managed to gain access to the stricken ship yesterday as guide ropes were installed to help them through the tricky and fast currents in the area, although for many of those waiting in Jindo the recovery was still not quick enough.\n\nRelatives of those listed as missing, but who are now presumed to be dead, clashed briefly with police when about 100 of them tried to leave the island by a road bridge to the mainland to take their protest to the capital city of Seoul.\n\nPolice blocked them and they later turned back. \"Bring me the body,\" weeping mother Bae Sun-ok said of her child as she was comforted by two policemen at the bridge.\n\nMore than 500 parents of the schoolchildren and relatives of other people missing have spent four days and nights cooped up in a gymnasium in the port city of Jindo, which is the centre of the rescue operation.\n\nTempers have frayed over the slow pace of the recovery and frequent changes in information.\n\nPresident Park Geun-hye was booed by some of the relatives when she visited the gym on Thursday. Students at the school in Ansan, a gritty commuter town, set up shrines to the dead and posted messages for the missing.\n\nThe vice-principal of the school, who was on the ferry and survived the capsize, hanged himself outside the gymnasium in Jindo in another blow to the school and his body was discovered by police on Friday.\n\nThe sinking looks set to be the country's worst maritime disaster in 21 years in terms of loss of life. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/4c219200b841ed2e55f927539013894ad696b6b65ffb1f662ef1f6bc511c5193?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Gaining access: Guide ropes were installed to help the divers through the tricky and fast currents in the area. - PHOTO: AFP"}]}

By Justine Moss\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 18, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nFOR those Singapore golf fans who have been experiencing withdrawal symptoms from the lack of professional men's golf tournament, the good news is that it is set to change next month. The European Tour will be returning to Singapore in May after a two-year hiatus - and it will be co-sanctioning The Championship event with the Asian Tour.\n\nFormerly the Ballantine's Championship in South Korea, the tournament will be played out on the Masters Course at Laguna National Golf and Country Club (LNGCC) from May 1-4. The last time that both tours co-sanctioned events in Singapore was in 2012, with the Singapore Open (from 2009 to 2012). And prior to that, between 2002 and 2007 with the Singapore Masters. LNGCC's World Classic course is slated to host The Championship in conjunction with the grand opening of its new Dusit Thani resort hotel in 2016.\n\nThis year's tournament was originally slated to be played in South Korea next month. But, according to David Ciclitira, CEO and chairman of Parallel Media Group, the promoters of the event, when staging issues made it clear that was not going to be possible, he and the European Tour acted quickly and decisively to move the tournament to Singapore.\n\n\"Singapore was selected to host the tournament because it is a world-class venue for international sporting events, including golf, and rose to the challenge to provide an alternative venue in such a short timeframe,\" he explains. \"Peter Kwee (Laguna National owner) and myself have been friends and partners for many years and we've always discussed the possibility about bringing back a European Tour tournament to Singapore some day. When it was decided that we'll hold the tournament in Singapore, Laguna was the natural choice, given our great partnership on the Caltex Singapore Masters previously and more recently the Prudential Causeway Trophy, and I have great faith that this event could shape the landscape of local golf for years to come.\"\n\nThe agreement in-principle is to keep the tournament at Laguna for as long as the event is in Singapore. While Ballantines has decided not to continue its sponsorship, some of the other sponsors for next month's event include Volvik, Audemars Piguet, DP World and Swissotel/Fairmont.\n\nAs originally planned, a field of 156 players will battle it out for a share of the US$1.5 million prize fund, while the event will be beamed to a potential television audience of over 450 million homes in 60 countries. The field will consist of players from Europe and Asia, with six spots in the tournament being allocated to Singaporean players. The latter include Mardan Mamat and Lam Chih Bing. Other confirmed players include British amateur champion Garrick Porteous and American Peter Uihlein, once the world's top-ranked amateur, in addition to a 20-member team from South Korea, including Hong Soon Sang and Kim Do Hoon.\n\nSays Mr Ciclitira: \"It is a bit unfortunate that Singapore has had no men's golf competition for quite some time. As the country celebrates its Golden Jubilee next year, we hope to continue this top tier tournament here in Singapore, to mark this historic occasion and a new era of professional golf in Singapore.\" He continues: \"Furthermore, with the introduction of golf to the 2016 Olympic Games, the availability of more professional-standard tournaments such as the Championship at Laguna National and the Prudential Causeway Trophy, which gives local players the opportunity to raise their international standing is more important than ever. We hope to help place Singapore on the international map for sports, bringing it one step closer to achieving its vision of being a Sports Hub.\"\n\nWith the return of the second Prudential Causeway Trophy (PCT) on the World Classic course in early June, it's going to be a busy couple of months for the staff at LNGCC. A total of 24 top golfers from both Singapore and Malaysia will battle it out for the PCT in a three-day Ryder Cup-style tournament from June 6-8. The inaugural event at Laguna last year saw Singapore triumphing 15 \u00bd to 8 \u00bd. This year the teams will be led by captains Mohd Said bin Abdul Latif for Singapore and M Ramayah for Malaysia, and will compete in a match play format in four ball, foursome and singles games. The addition of a new Prudential Junior Causeway Trophy on June 4 will provide some of Singapore and Malaysia's top juniors an opportunity to play in the format of the Junior Ryder Cup.\n\nSays Patrick Bowers, CEO of Laguna Hospitality: \"With the preparation underway on the World Classic Course to host the second Prudential Causeway Trophy at Laguna National in early June, we had to quickly ramp up to also prepare the Masters Course for The Championship at Laguna National. We have added staff, new equipment, immediately embarked upon fertilising programmes to prepare the tees and greens, and of course, made use of the expertise and help provided by the tournament preparation teams at the European and the Asian Tour. It won't be easy as we all know the severe drought conditions that Singapore has experienced since January - but our team is fighting hard.\"\n\nHe adds: \"Spectators are in for a treat. Both The Championship at Laguna National and Prudential Causeway Trophy at Laguna National continue our plan to offer complimentary spectator access. It is our desire to share competitive golf at the highest levels with Singaporeans and tourists from abroad free of charge and to urge Singaporeans to get out and support their national players. In a unique nod to supporting professional golf in Singapore, the promoter has fought for and achieved five exemptions for Singaporean pros who would not otherwise have qualified. What a fantastic opportunity for them to compete in front of a home crowd against some of the best in the world.\"\n\nThe Championship will take place on LNGCC's Masters Course from May 1-4 while the Prudential Causeway Trophy will be played out on LNGCC's World Classic course from June 6-8.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Initial excitement over the recovery from a deep recession has faded, reflected in a fall of some fast-growing company stocks. Some strategists say that we are now entering the later stages of the economic growth cycle, when safer, more defensive stocks such as utilities and old-line pharmaceuticals take the lead.\n\nThe \"growth\" stocks of the Nasdaq Composite - particularly small technology and biotechnology stocks - led the bull market since it began in 2009. At its low of 3,999 early last week, the Nasdaq Composite was down 8.2 per cent from its March peak, almost at the 10 per cent loss level considered a correction. And for those investors and day traders who buy popular \"momentum\" stocks, the first two weeks of this month were a full-fledged bear market.\n\nIntercept Pharmaceuticals, a biotech company that's developed a promising treatment for liver disease, lost nearly half of its value between March 19 and April 16. Makers of 3-D printers, which some people argue have the power to revolutionise manufacturing, have lost similar increments. Many stocks in the niche of social networking, arguably the most significant commercial trend of the 21st century, also plunged.\n\nFor this small, but influential group of momentum stocks, comparisons with the pop of the Internet bubble in 2000 are apt. As in that year, the sudden rout was prompted by a change in sentiment rather than anything related to the \"real economy\".\n\nSome strategists say that the selling began in biotech and technology exchange-traded funds, the popular alternatives to mutual funds that many investors use to follow market trends. An initial trickle then became a flood.\n\nContrast the rout on the Nasdaq to the performance of the more diversified S&P 500, which was never more than 4 per cent from its record high, and could test that record again next week. Some slower growing, dividend-paying \"value\" stocks such as nuclear power generator Exelon actually rose during the April rout.\n\nTwo gauges from index compiler Russell Investments provide the sharpest illustration of the changes below the surface of the stock market. The Russell 1000 tracks the 1,000 largest US-listed stocks. The growth sub-index of the Russell 1000 was more or less flat for this year at the close on Friday, while the value sub-index was up nearly 3 per cent. That's in marked contrast to the last five years, when the growth sub-indices either led or were neck and neck with the value sub-index. Strategists at one brokerage said that the sudden ascendance of value stocks looks like an inflection point.\n\n\"Since (Federal Reserve chairwoman) Janet Yellen's comment on March 19, in only two of the 17 subsequent trading sessions has growth significantly led value,\" said analysts at brokerage Morgan Stanley, in a research note early last week. \"We determined that rotations this strong, while infrequent, are typically followed by periods where value outperforms.\"\n\nThe market's message has changed from \"things can only get better\" to \"things could be worse\".\n\nTraders had braced for disappointment in quarterly earnings after a bitter winter disrupted work and play for many Americans. Quarterly earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to grow a modest 1.7 per cent on aggregate, according to data from Thomson Reuters. That still counts as a positive surprise. Again, however, traders sold highfliers such as Google in the wake of their earnings and rotated into companies that reported steadier - if less spectacular - growth, such as General Electric and Johnson & Johnson.\n\nThis week, the pattern could be repeated as cyclical companies such as AK Steel and Facebook will likely face higher hurdles as they try to impress investors than defensive companies such as power producer Entergy.\n\nInvestors in economically sensitive stocks will have to hope for a strong showing in March durable-goods orders and weekly unemployment claims.\n\nStill, the broad market's rapid recovery from the rout bodes well for the year. The fact that buyers came back to the S&P 500 around the 1,800 mark and the Nasdaq around the 4,000 mark may establish a \"floor\" at these levels, according to technical traders.\n\nPlus, the original inspirations for the bull market - improving economic and corporate-growth prospects, loose central-bank policy, and relatively cheap stocks - are almost all still in place, said Oliver Pursche, president of money manager Gary Goldberg Financial Services.\n\nIf there is a shadow still hanging over the stock market, it probably looks a lot like Russian President Vladimir Putin. Two months after his initial move in Ukraine, Mr Putin is still keeping the world guessing over his endgame. \"The market clearly has got a floor underneath it as a result of low interest rates and ongoing economic (growth),\" said Mr Pursche. \"Any kind of break through the floor, a 7 per cent, 8 per cent correction would most likely come from some kind of geopolitical shock.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Authorities believe that is the most likely area where the missing jet hit the ocean after disappearing. A series of \"pings\" recorded earlier this month have led searchers to the remote stretch of ocean in the belief that the signals may have come from the plane's black box recorders.\n\nHowever, with no pings received in more than a week and the black box's battery now 10 days past its approximate expiry date, authorities are relying on the drone.\n\nThe \"Bluefin-21\" drone completed its first full 16-hour deployment at a depth of 4.5 km late on Wednesday after a series of technical problems cut short the first two attempts. \"Bluefin-21 has searched approximately 90 square kilometres to date and the data from its latest mission is being analysed,\" the Joint Agency Coordination Centre, the body running the search, said in a statement.\n\nOn Monday, the search coordinator, retired Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, said the air and surface search for debris would likely end in three days as the operation shifted its focus to the largely unmapped area of ocean floor.\n\nHowever, authorities said yesterday that up to 10 military aircraft, two civil aircraft and 11 ships would still search an area totalling about 40,000 sq km. That would suggest searchers, under pressure from the families of those on board the plane, still hold some hope of finding floating wreckage.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Tony Abbott was quoted by The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday as saying that \"we believe that (underwater) search will be completed within a week or so. If we don't find wreckage, we stop, we regroup, we reconsider\".\n\nAsked by Reuters yesterday to clarify Mr Abbott's comments to the newspaper, his office said he was only suggesting that authorities may change the area being searched by the Bluefin-21 drone, not that the search would be called off.\n\n\"They've been looking for 40 days and haven't found anything floating yet,\" Geoffrey Dell, Associate Professor of Accident Investigation and Forensics at Central Queensland University, told Reuters. \"You'd have to start saying there's either nothing to find or let's move elsewhere,\" he said.\n\nAs well as the Bluefin-21, authorities are relying on daily modelling of ocean currents provided by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's Marine and Atmospheric Research unit, which may give clues about how any surface debris may have dispersed.

The facility has purchased about 1,000 leading-edge 300mm chip manufacturing tools from Taiwanese firm ProMOS DRAM fab.\n\nSanta Clara, California- based GF acquired Singapore's flagship chip foundry Chartered Semiconductor for US$3.9 billion in January 2010. \"In 2012, GF announced its Vision 2015 plan to expand its 300mm facility at Fab 7 in Singapore to one million wafers per annum,\" the company's senior vice-president and general manager for Singapore, Ang Kay Chai, told The Business Times.\n\n\"We are in the process of upgrading and converting our Fab 6 from 200mm to 300mm clean room. This is being done in phases to ensure we also protect our 200mm customers' business continuity needs. We are running 200mm and 300mm production lines in parallel in Singapore,\" he said.\n\nGF makes semicon chips for companies that embed them in cellphones, other mobile devices, automobiles, computers and industrial equipment. GF is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ATIC (Advanced Technology Investment Company), the high-tech investment arm of Mubadala, which is the sovereign wealth fund of the government of Abu Dhabi.\n\nATIC has invested US$15 billion so far to create one of the fastest-growing semicon companies in the world. Early this year, it announced plans to commit an additional US$9 billion to beef up its semicon operations. ATIC was set up in 2008, at the nadir of the semicon industry downturn.\n\nIn 2009, for the second time in two consecutive years, the global chip manufacturing industry declined. \"Never before has the semiconductor industry experienced revenue declines in back-to-back years, but this will occur in 2009,\" warned research house Gartner Inc in December 2008.\n\n\"Global semicon revenue is forecast to total US$219.2 billion, a 16.3 per cent decline from 2008. In 2008, chip revenues reached US$261.9 billion, down 4.4 per cent from 2007.\"\n\nIn early 2009, ATIC and AMD formed GF as a joint venture. In March 2012, GF acquired the remaining 8.6 per cent stake from AMD. The company's Singapore site hosts five wafer fabrication plants that make 200mm silicon wafers (four in Woodlands and one in Tampines) and one - called Fab 7 - that produces 300mm wafers. The Singapore sites employ about 6,000 staff.\n\n\"We are upgrading system infrastructure, including factory automation, in our 200mm fabs,\" Mr Ang said. \"We have deployed a mobile robotics solution; set up a standardised manufacturing data platform, and are rolling out energy efficiency processes.\"\n\nGF ranks second globally in wafer fab revenues after Taiwan giant TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) and has overtaken another Taiwanese company, UMC (United Microelectronics Corp).\n\nGF is the only one with manufacturing sites in three continents: Singapore in Asia, Dresden in Europe, and New York in the US. Other players in this space include Samsung Semiconductor, IBM, MagnaChip and Singapore-based SSMC, a joint venture between TSMC and Nasdaq- listed NXP Semiconductors.\n\nSingapore is a key site for GF. \"Singapore has more than 25 years of foundry manufacturing excellence and is the largest manufacturing site in our global footprint,\" Mr Ang said. \"Singapore's foundry expertise and broad customer base in the mainstream semicon market are key reasons ATIC acquired Chartered Semiconductor in 2010.\"\n\nAbout 27 per cent of ATIC's parent Mubadala's total portfolio of US$55.4 billion has been invested in semiconductors. The rest is spread out among acquisitions in real estate, hospitality, aerospace, healthcare, renewable energy and ICT. The global market for semicon chips was worth US$332 billion in 2013, according to estimates from Gartner.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates is Singapore's 14th largest trading partner, with total bilateral trade crossing S$25 billion in 2012. In the Arabian Gulf region, the UAE overtook Saudi Arabia as Singapore's top regional trading partner in 2012.\n\n\"Singapore has brand equity in the UAE,\" Umej Bhatia, Singapore's first resident ambassador to the UAE, told visiting journalists from the Singapore Press Club in Abu Dhabi recently. \"Abu Dhabi has chosen Singapore as one of its four models for development, along with Norway, Ireland and New Zealand in its ambitious 2030 plan.\"\n\nThe writer, BT's former BizIT editor, was a member of the recent Singapore Press Club mission to Abu Dhabi and Oman\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He has been accumulating shares of Pteris, and now controls about 10 per cent of the company.\n\nCIMC holds 15 per cent of Pteris - which runs baggage handling at airports - from a share placement in August 2012.\n\nIt made public its RTO intention in February last year - a deal that involves injecting its subsidiary Tianda Group, a maker of passenger boarding bridges that are used at airports, into Pteris.\n\nA reverse takeover is better understood as a backdoor listing, since it turns a private company into a listed firm without an initial public offering.\n\nThe private company injects assets into a listed company, usually a small loss-making firm or a shell corporation, and the listed company places out new shares to the private firm, making them the new controlling shareholders of the transformed entity.\n\nIn this case, CIMC is expected to hold 75 per cent of the new company once the RTO is completed.\n\nThis is the third backdoor listing led by a Chinese entity this year, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. Last week, Cacola Furniture International announced an RTO involving Goyes Investment Holdings Group.\n\nIf the RTO goes through, the furniture maker will morph into a company that cuts its teeth in livestock breeding as well as meat processing. It also develops property - the popular flavour among Chinese corporates.\n\nHanKore Environment Tech Group is also involved in an RTO linking to China Everbright Water Investments. The Chinese firm is involved in wastewater treatment and solar-power generation.\n\nPteris shares last closed at 12.7 cents on Wednesday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By AMIT ROY CHOUDHURY\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Apr 20, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWHILE the Heartbleed bug is very much in the news due to its sheer scale, it is by no means the only threat or the most dangerous one out on the Internet. A new report says that last year saw an explosion in the number of data breaches, and \"mega breaches\" - breaches exposing more than 10 million identities - increased from one in 2012 to eight in 2013.\n\nThe latest edition of Internet Security Threat Report shows that, in total, more than 552 million identities were breached in 2013, putting consumers' financial information, birth dates, government ID numbers, home addresses, medical records, passwords and other personal information into the hands of cybercriminals.\n\nSpeaking to BizIT, Tan Yuh Woei, Symantec Singapore's country director, put things in perspective. \"One of the key breaches was a credit card security breach in South Korea in December 2013, where 105 million accounts were exposed and sold to marketing firms. Besides the financial impact of data breaches, the damage to a company's reputation and the loss of consumer trust may be irrevocably impaired.\"\n\nMr Tan notes that this ties in with Symantec's Singapore findings that the finance, insurance and real estate sectors face the most attacks by cybercriminals. \"This is no doubt due to how lucrative the financial sector is becoming, where a cost of US$215 is incurred per lost record, as outlined in an earlier report we conducted.\"\n\nThe modus operandi of cybercriminals has evolved and this is in part due to the potential and significant potential payouts from mega breaches. Studies show that one major breach is possibly worth 50 smaller attacks. The potential for huge paydays means large-scale attacks are here to stay. Companies of all sizes need to re-examine, rethink and possibly re-architect their security posture, says Mr Tan.\n\nBesides profitability, there's been a distinct shift in the behaviour of cyber-criminals. This is aided by a combination of increased sophistication and patience, amid an evolving landscape. In 2013, targeted attackers shifted away from the common \"spray and pray\" approach towards longer and more targeted attack campaigns.\n\nThis, says Mr Tan, means that attacks are now conducted in a \"low and slow\" way - a sign that user awareness and protection technologies have driven spear phishers to tighten their targeting and sharpen their social engineering efforts. Spear phishing refers to an e-mail spoofing attempt that targets a specific organisation with the objective of getting unauthorised access to confidential data.\n\n\"The average attack campaign can now last three times longer, contributing to the overall efficiency of the attacks. To increase the rate of success, attackers also consider the impact of real-world social engineering, which combines virtual and real-world attacks,\" Mr Tan notes.\n\nWith Singapore being a hub for many businesses in sectors ranging from pharmaceutical/biomedical to infocomm and banking, there is a greater motive for cybercriminals to cast an eye on the country in terms of the profit factor, says Mr Tan. \"For example, spam was the most rampant in the pharmaceutical industry in Singapore, registering a rate of 76.4 per cent. Such industries have the added appeal of money in their bank accounts and IP (intellectual property) worth stealing, both of which make them attractive targets to cybercriminals\".\n\nAccording to the report, Singapore's Internet security threat profile has seen a slight decline, with a rank of 37th in 2013, compared to a better ranking of 40th in 2012. (The higher the ranking, the lower the threat profile.)\n\nSpam, phishing and malware\n\nIn terms of spam, phishing and malware in Singapore and the top industries affected by them:\n\nGlobally, the US is ranked No 1 in the Internet security threat profile, followed by China and India. When asked about the implications for countries in the Asia-Pacific region with regard to the threat profile of China and India, Mr Tan says companies doing business with their counterparts in these two countries would be faced with increased security risks.\n\n\"These could include loss of trust and reputation, as well as a higher potential of consumers' personal information being compromised - from credit card numbers, to medical records, to passwords and bank accounts. While it will not be difficult to quantify the financial impact of data breaches, the damage to a company's reputation and the loss of consumer trust can be much harder to recover.\"\n\nMr Tan notes that while there are several important steps businesses should take to protect their data, including maintaining a comprehensive and up-to-date security infrastructure, these are a few key best practices:\n\namit@sph.com.sg\n\n@AmitRoyCBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 18, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n\"Sporty performance\" is not a label often used for a model in the Mercedes-Benz range of family sedans. But when it comes to the new C400 4Matic, it seems totally appropriate. The Mercedes-Benz C400 4Matic compact saloon is a high-end variant of the new C-Class line-up that will arrive here later this year.\n\nWhile the entry-level C-Class models such as the C200 and C250 have four-cylinder turbocharged engines to drive the rear wheels, the C400 4Matic comes with a punchy 3.0-litre twin-turbo V6 to send power to all four wheels. The 4Matic permanent all-wheel-drive system splits power 45:55 between the front and rear axles - and this is achieved without the use of regular differential locks. Instead, it relies on a combination of the ESP Electronic Stability Program's drive dynamics and the 4ETS electronic traction system. As a result, 4Matic is lighter than other conventional four-wheel-drive systems, adding just 70 kg to the car's kerb weight rather than the usual 120 kg for other systems. With all-wheel-drive, traction and stability for this small but powerful Merc is increased. And because the 4Matic system is rear-biased, driving pleasure is also increased.\n\nThis C-Class brims with confidence. Its 333 hp and 480 Newton-metres of torque enable lightning fast response to pressure from the gas pedal. Yet the strong torque is deployed with maximum grip. Handling benefits from the newly developed four-link front suspension. Previously a three-link set-up, it improves steering and stability in corners. The rear suspension retains Merc's accomplished five-link set-up, which has been optimised for improved straight line stability. In a first for its segment, the C-Class can be ordered with optional air suspension or AirMatic.\n\nDespite the newfound sportiness of its handling, the latest C-Class is actually more luxurious with a body that is longer and wider but marginally lower, and it has a 2,840 wheelbase that's been extended by 80 mm. Its styling closely follows the design language of the S-Class, both inside and outside. The cabin comes across as being especially opulent, considering its predecessor's conventional and almost basic interior.\n\nWhat also stands out is the level of safety equipment. The new C-Class comes standard with Collision Prevention Assist Plus, which includes autonomous braking in case the driver does not do so to avoid, say, another car or a pedestrian. Other equipment that stand out include an Adaptive Brake with brake priming and brake drying functions, Steer Control steering assist function, Crosswind Assist, Torque Vectoring Brake and Attention Assist. All these make for safe driving. But most of all, they make the C400 4Mati surprisingly an athletic alternative that's fun to drive.\n\nsamuelee@sph.com.sg\n\nSPECS\n\nMercedes-Benz\n\nC400 4Matic\n\nEngine\n\n2,996cc V6 turbocharged\n\nTransmission\n\n7-speed 7G-Tronic automatic\n\nMax power\n\n333 hp rpm\n\nMax torque\n\n480 Nm\n\nTop speed\n\n250 kmh\n\nDistributor\n\nCycle & Carriage\n\nTel\n\n6298 1818\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/vitamin-d-keeps-doctor-away", "site_title": "Vitamin D keeps the doctor away", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nVitamin D keeps the doctor away\n\nStudies show that it helps with bone health, lowers the risk of diabetes and heart attacks\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 18, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nONE would think that most people who live in the tropics will not be lacking in Vitamin D given that there is sunshine all year round. The surprising thing is that a large majority of my patients who live in the tropics do not have sufficient Vitamin D; the main reason being that most of them live in modern cities and spend most of their time in offices. While it is a well-known fact that Vitamin D deficiency leads to rickets, a bone disease in the young, less is known about the need for Vitamin D in adults.\n\nFunctions of Vitamin D\n\nVitamin D is routinely produced by our skin upon exposure to the ultraviolet B (UVB) light of the sun. The Vitamin D in the body behaves like a hormone, and beyond the commonly known effect of Vitamin D on the absorption of calcium from the gut, it has multiple effects at the cellular level with diverse functions such as preventing abnormal cells from multiplying in the large intestine, helping to control the blood pressure in the kidney and helping to control the blood sugar in the pancreas.\n\nVitamin D and bones\n\nFor a long time, doctors were dispensing calcium tablets to postmenopausal women routinely until studies published a few years ago showed that excessive calcium intake, through calcium supplements, was linked to increased incidence of stroke and heart attacks. This was considered to be due to the increased deposition of calcium in the walls of the arteries of the heart and brain resulting in hardening, degenerative changes and narrowing of the arteries. There was also an increased incidence of stones in the kidneys. In the light of these findings, the focus shifted towards ensuring that Vitamin D levels were adequate. Vitamin D when consumed gets converted to an active form that regulates calcium absorption in the body.\n\nDespite the findings of the dangers of excessive consumption of calcium, the mass media is inundated with advertisements on the \"goodness\" of regular consumption of high calcium milk and calcium fortified foods. The current recommendation for those with a healthy diet is to avoid calcium supplements and to take Vitamin D instead for bone health.\n\nStudies have shown that elderly individuals with low Vitamin D levels are more likely to develop fractures and higher doses of Vitamin D intake can reduce the likelihood of fractures.\n\nAn analysis of more than 40,000 elderly individuals, combining the data from 12 studies on the prevention of fracture, found that vitamin D intakes of about 800 IU per day decreased hip bone and non-spine fractures by 20 per cent, while lower dosages (400 IU or less) did not provide any protection. In addition, adequate Vitamin D intake can potentially increase muscular strength, thereby reducing the likelihood of falls, a common problem for the elderly. An analysis from the data of multiple trials found that this benefit was seen only in those taking 700 to 1000 IU of Vitamin D daily and was not seen in those on lower doses.\n\nVitamin D and the heart\n\nMultiple studies, including the Health Professional Follow-Up Study which examined the vitamin D levels in close to 50,000 healthy men for 10 years , found a twofold risk of heart attack in those with low vitamin D levels. Studies have also shown that lower Vitamin D levels are seen in those with heart failure, high blood pressure and stroke. There is some evidence that Vitamin D may have a role in regulating blood pressure and preventing artery damage.\n\nVitamin D and diabetes risk\n\nVitamin D levels also have an association with increased incidence or likelihood of developing diabetes mellitus, a major risk factor for heart disease. Diabetics are commonly found in populations who have low Vitamin D levels or who avoid sunshine. Vitamin D supplementation of 800 IU/day was associated with lower incidence of diabetes requiring oral medication.\n\nA child living in Finland has about 400 times increased risk of developing diabetes requiring insulin than a child in Venezuela. A 30-year study on more than 10,000 Finnish children found that those on vitamin D supplementation since infancy had about 90 per cent risk reduction of developing diabetes as compared to those not on supplements. Other smaller European studies have also showed a similar result.\n\nVitamin D and cancer\n\nThe difference in the incidence of large intestine cancers between those who live in the north and those who live near the equator have led physicians to examine the relationship between Vitamin D and large intestine cancer. Studies have shown that there is an association between cancer of the large intestines and low Vitamin D levels. However, there is no available data yet to demonstrate that Vitamin D consumption will lower cancer risk.\n\nSunshine versus Vitamin D supplementation\n\nIf you are applying sunblock to your skin, unless the sunblock blocks both ultraviolet A (UVA) and UVB light from the sun, you may end up only blocking UVB but not UVA.\n\nIn that case, the Vitamin D forming effect of the sun may be absent but the skin damaging rays of the sun will still persist. Hence, if you apply sunblock regularly on your exposed skin or are a vegetarian, you are likely to have low Vitamin D levels. Food content of Vitamin D is generally low, though fish and eggs have better Vitamin D content.\n\nIn case you start deciding to get more sunshine on your skin , be aware that sunburns and the regular use of tanning machines will increase the incidence of skin cancers especially melanomas, the most serious skin cancer. This is especially so in those who have pre-existing moles, freckles and immediate family members with skin cancers. Melanomas also seem to be more aggressive and are associated with higher death rates in those with Vitamin D deficiency.\n\nIn case you start loading yourself with large amounts of Vitamin D, you may want to know that recent analysis of combined data from multiple trials (meta-analysis) were not able to demonstrate any significant benefits. One of the major drawbacks of meta-analysis is that it combines data from populations who have different base levels of Vitamin D and are of diverse backgrounds, and the studies used for analysis have different aims and different trial designs.\n\nThe main practical point from these results is that one should not be consuming Vitamin D excessively if the body has adequate Vitamin D levels.\n\nIn an article on Vitamin D published this month in the highly regarded Circulation Journal, the authors recommend that if you are deficient in Vitamin D and are at risk of heart attack or stroke, one should aim to achieve normal Vitamin D levels by either appropriate Vitamin D supplementation or increased sunshine exposure. Sunshine exposure is usually less likely to damage the skin if it is in the early morning or late afternoon. The take home message is that Vitamin D deficiency should be avoided but excessive Vitamin D supplementation has not been shown to be beneficial.\n\nThis series is brought to you by Heart, Stroke and Cancer Centre.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And so it was that when Alain Ducasse set foot on the MAD symposium in Copenhagen last year - a convention of chefs from around the world - he reduced culinary stars such as Noma's Rene Redzepi, Momofuku's David Chang and Coi's Daniel Patterson into nervous fanboys meeting the man whose name is practically synonymous with French cuisine.\n\n\"Alain is like one of the godfathers of cuisine,\" says Chef Redzepi. \"I grew up reading his books, studying them meticulously, so to me Alain Ducasse is a big part of the cook I have become.\"\n\nAfter 25 years and over 20 Michelin stars, the 57-year-old chef-entrepreneur continues to chalk up new ventures the way other people collect stamps. In 2013 alone, he closed his restaurant at Plaza Athenee for refurbishment and took over the Restaurant Le Meurice from its departing chef, three Michelin-starred Yannick Alleno. He opened an upscale chocolate boutique, acquired an old bistro as part of a conservation project and was recruited by American space agency Nasa to create special event meals for astronauts (which he had already been doing for the French equivalent CNES since 2006). He's also written a kid's cookbook, is re-opening Plaza Athenee this year and plans to open restaurants in London and a French-Chinese restaurant in Beijing in 2015. That doesn't even include his philanthropic efforts that include teaching underprivileged women cooking skills to improve their lives.\n\n\"All these (projects) are equally important to me,\" says Mr Ducasse. \"They demonstrate our ability to maintain our development even in a difficult economic environment. It means that our strategy - aiming for excellence in all aspects of culinary activities, from hospitality to training, consulting and publishing - is right.\"\n\nWith his finger in so many pies, so to speak, it's no wonder that he's often labelled as a businessman more than a chef. But he begs to differ, citing his interest in food and cooking as his highest priority - it's just that he found a way to build a successful business model in the process. Plus it's not as big an \"empire\" as people think. \"The company is quite average in size,\" he explains, \"and I'm definitely a chef - with very competent people around me taking care of the management aspects.\"\n\nWhen the money part is taken care of, it frees Mr Ducasse to do what he likes best - dabble in his food-related passions. At Le Meurice, which re-opened last September, he and Chef Christophe Saintange took stripped down basics to a luxurious high, with perfect seasonal produce presented as au naturel as possible to reflect his own locavore philosophy. He also introduced the bean-to-bar concept in his artisanal chocolate boutique in Paris's Bastille neighbourhood, where people can see and smell chocolate being made before buying it.\n\nHe also indulged in his passion for old bistros by acquiring Allard, one of three historic establishments he's taken upon himself to preserve for posterity. \"Bistros are iconic of an art of living,\" says Mr Ducasse. \"The Parisian ones, for instance, have their own heritage, often linked to rural families who emigrated in the 19th century from the central region of France to Paris. They have a genuine culinary identity and a very warm atmosphere that I wanted to maintain.\" Fortunately for his bottom line, the three bistros are \"running profitably\".\n\nWith so much attention on international cuisine such as Chef Redzepi's Nordic movement and the Peruvian or Japanese craze, does he fear that French cooking is being sidelined?\n\n\"The blossoming of cuisines - in many countries - is definitely great news for our industry. Does it jeopardise the influence of French cuisine? Surely not. France remains the largest culinary school in the world. Every single day, we welcome and train young cooks from all over the world in our kitchens. Every single day, French cuisine is prepared and served in restaurants throughout the world.\"\n\nIf anything, he reckons French cuisine faces an image issue abroad. But with so many French chefs expanding overseas - Bocuse, Robuchon, Savoy, Gagnaire, etc - as well as successful pastry chefs, \"France may have more chefs exporting their know-how than any other country\".\n\nIf these chefs can work together as a kind of collective, they can boost the image of French cuisine, feels Mr Ducasse. That's why he and 14 other top chefs including Joel Robuchon, Yannick Alleno, Guy Savoy and Anne-Sophie Pic created the cooking school Le Coll\u00e8ge Culinaire de France - \"to promote French culinary know-how in France and abroad, among professionals, amateurs and politicians\".\n\nAlthough he has been opening restaurants all over the world, the one city he has yet to conquer is Singapore. \"Singapore would be a perfect location - there is the clientele and the products\", is his noncommittal reply. \"We look at every opportunity, but there is no rush. We have enough on our plate now. I'm much more interested in quality than in quantity!\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Unfortunately, that also meant he had to cut some songs short by singing only one verse and chorus; or stringing them into a medley.\n\nHence, The Commodores'\n\nBrick House\n\nand\n\nRapid Fire\n\nbecame one sweaty funk workout while My Love was slipped into the end of Easy. Thankfully, his solo hits - the ballads such as\n\nPenny Lover, Stuck on You, Hello, Say You Say Me\n\nand more - weren't subject to any butchering and were sung in full.\n\nFor a show that had more slow songs than fast ones, Richie sure knew how to keep the energy high by leaving his audience in stitches with his cheeky stage banter.\n\nBut if there was anybody who could give Richie a run for his money when it comes to showmanship, it has got to be Andre Rieu, who played the same venue on an equally wet Wednesday evening. The Dutch violinist and conductor put on a classical concert unlike any other, cracking jokes in between the mix of operatic pieces and contemporary pop tunes he performed with his Johann Strauss Orchestra. The set-up looked like your typical classical gig with the orchestra members dressed in their finest ball gowns and tuxedos, the show starting promptly at the advertised time on the ticket, and even an intermission was slotted between the two sets.\n\nBut there's a reason why Rieu is one of the world's most popular conductors - the shaggy-haired 64-year-old makes classical music accessible and is not afraid to break tradition by being a rock star while at it.\n\nThat's why he's managed the rare feat of cracking Billboard's Top 25 Tours for the last five years as a classical artiste while playing an average of 80 shows annually.\n\nLike Richie, he's a crowdpleaser and wowed the audience just before the interval with a rendition of Burung Kakak Tua. And he's not called the King of Waltz for nothing; the moment he struck up Johann Strauss's The Blue Danube, a few audience members promptly got up from their seats and danced to it in the aisles .\n\nHis casual stage antics and easy-listening repertoire might sometimes be frowned upon by his peers and classical music purists - \"pop\" tunes such as\n\nYou'll Never Walk Alone, Time To Say Goodbye\n\nand\n\nMemory\n\nfrom the musical Cats were slipped in between classical pieces\n\nCarmina Burana and Libiamo\n\n- but Rieu has definitely figured out the secret to getting people hooked on a very niche genre.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So why would anyone pick a 420i over a 220i? The 4 Series is the two-door version of the 3 Series, while the 2 Series is that of the 1 Series. In 420i and 220i guise, both get the same two-litre turbocharged four-cylinder petrol engine to drive the rear wheels through a silken eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nWith virtually identical styling cues, including a sleek profile and frameless door windows, it would seem the only difference is that the 420i is a slightly larger version of the 220i.

The cabin may look similar to the 2 Series with its familiar dashboard and materials, but the 420i is more spacious with a calmer ambience because it is quieter, with the cabin well-insulated enough to filter out the noise of the engine.\n\nThe 420i is a recent addition to the 4 Series, which was first introduced here with the 435i. The latter has a three-litre, inline six-cylinder turbocharged engine producing 306 hp and 400 Nm.\n\nThe 420i, on the other hand, only manages 184 hp and 270 Nm. Strangely, however, it is a more involving drive. The steering has more feel, and the car generally feels more reactive. This is probably because at 1,505 kg, the 420i is 80 kg lighter than the 435i, or the weight of one slightly chubby adult.\n\nAt high speed, the 420i's fluidity and balance are impressive. Although this coupe is based on the 3 Series platform, it feels like a different car.\n\nOne reason is that the 420i rides 10 mm lower, with a ground clearance of 130 mm versus a 320i's 140 mm.\n\nAt 1,362 mm in height, the 420i is also 67 mm lower than the 1,429 mm tall 320i.\n\nMore importantly, don't expect the standard 320i to handle like the 420i.\n\nBMW engineered the 4 Series for a more dynamic drive by modifying its springs, dampers, axle kinematics and elastokinematics.\n\nAt the back, the rear five-link suspension gets extra-wide mounts and supports, while the axle subframes are ultra-stiff. The thrust arms also connect the suspension directly to the body to increase rigidity.\n\nSo among the various BMWs with the ubiquitous 2.0-litre turbo, the BMW 420i's balance and refinement set it apart not only as the most stylish version, but also the most grown-up alternative.\n\nsamuelee@sph.com.sg\n\nSPECS\n\nBMW 420i\n\nEngine\n\n1,997cc turbocharged\n\nTransmission\n\n8-speed automatic\n\nMax power\n\n184 hp @ 5,000 rpm\n\nMax torque\n\n270 Nm @ 1,250-4,500 rpm\n\n0-100 kmh\n\n7.3 secs\n\nTop speed\n\n236 kmh\n\nCO2 emissions\n\n139 g/km\n\nAverage OMV\n\n$45,000\n\nPrice\n\n$244,800 (with COE)\n\nDistributor\n\nPerformance Motors\n\nTel\n\n6319 0100\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Earlier, rescue teams hammered on the hull of the upturned vessel, hoping for a response from anyone trapped inside, but did not hear anything, media reports said.\n\nThe vessel, carrying 475 passengers and crew, capsized on Wednesday during a short journey from the port of Incheon to the holiday island of Jeju.\n\nTen bodies have been recovered and 179 people were rescued, according to the South Korean government, leaving 286 unaccounted for and possibly still trapped in the vessel.\n\nGrieving parents accused rescue teams of being slow to react and for lack of information, although government officials said that search efforts had continued through the night.\n\n\"I am really angry with the government,\" said Kwak Hyun-ok, whose daughter was one of 340 children and teachers from one school on the vessel. \"There is no meaning to life without my daughter.\"\n\nThe government said three cranes were being moved to the site of the accident and would arrive today, although efforts were continuing to establish whether there were any survivors on the stricken vessel.\n\nSouth Korean President Park Geun-hye was met with angry shouts, shrieks and wailing from the relatives when she visited a site near where the ferry sank.\n\n\"We will make every effort to rescue up to the last person,\" Ms Park said.\n\nThere is still no official explanation for the sinking, although the government has launched a formal inquiry. The ship, built in Japan 20 years ago, was following a well travelled route. Although the wider area has rock hazards and shallow waters, they were not in the immediate vicinity of its usual path.\n\nState broadcaster YTN quoted investigation officials as saying the ship was off its usual course and had been hit by a veering wind which caused containers stacked on deck to shift.\n\nThe vessel was listing heavily to one side on Wednesday as passengers wearing life jackets scrambled into the sea and waiting rescue boats, according to television footage. It sank in roughly two hours and witnesses and local media showed that just two life rafts from the ship successfully inflated and launched.Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

But this is the easy way out, and there is no guarantee that things could improve for the airline.\n\nFor this reason, no matter how vigorously fee-hungry investment bankers pitch to state-owned Khazanah Nasional - the airline's major shareholder - that it should take the carrier private, now is not the time. Taking Malaysia Airlines private has to be part of a well thought out strategic plan, not an act of desperation in the wake of an unprecedented crisis or because its share price has tanked.\n\nThe weighty decisions facing the airline - how to trim the bloated 20,000-strong workforce, slash cost, fend off nimble rivals, stem sliding yields, build a profitable network and woo customers back - are very much the same now as they were before the ill-fated plane vanished. The solutions will not miraculously turn up just because the carrier is privatised and concomitantly shielded from public scrutiny, cumbersome quarterly reports and bureaucratic layers.\n\nThe airline's formidable union, which has been a stumbling block to current chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya's efforts to revive the firm, will not turn meek just because the firm is no longer publicly listed.\n\nIf privatisation is indeed the magic bullet, then Malaysia Airlines should have been privatised a long time ago. That way, it could have spared itself the three huge cash calls in seven years, more so because they were just band-aids which bought more time but not strength for the waning national carrier.\n\nMalaysia Airlines has changed bosses six times in 13 years and whipped up countless turnaround plans. While some were bold and radical, sadly none was sustainable or fruitful. Surely, if the simpler plan to privatise the carrier and spin off some of its entities and list them separately down the road were \"ideal\", as Maybank Kim Eng Research recently suggested, this would have been done already.\n\nNow is not the right time for that. There is no sharper whip than the public market to instil discipline in a company. Left on its own, with only one kind of investor conversation - a soliloquy no less - it could be easier for the carrier to slip into inertia with lower accountability.\n\nThe embattled airline, mired in red ink, can ill afford that. It ought to stay the course and rebuild itself as a proud flag carrier. Although hurting right now, the airline is still in a position to leverage its strong brand equity and 40-year history once the weight of the current crisis is lifted. It shouldn't be allowed to go dark - not yet, at least.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Chew Hui-Yan\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 18, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nFROM chili crab to cereal prawns, seafood is a firm fixture in Singapore's ever-expanding gastronomical landscape. It would be unthinkable, then, that the likes of red snapper and tiger prawns may cease to exist here.\n\nThe threat of such an occurrence is why the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) wants to raise awareness of the issue. hence, they are organising Singapore's first Sustainable Seafood Festival, slated to take place this June.\n\nFrom June 8-15, eight restaurants including Absinthe Restaurant Francais, Gattopardo Ristorante di Mare and the soon-to-be-opened Seasons Bistro will serve a special menu with seafood supplied by MSC certified distributors such as Indoguna and Lee Fish.\n\nThe MSC label means that the seafood was sustainably caught, allowing ocean stocks to be replenished and the ecosystem to remain in balance.\n\nDiners can look forward to environmentally friendly fare such as Blackened Hake Fish Tacos ($16) at the Seasons Bistro and Marinated Chilean Sea bass ($45) at the Conrad hotel's Oscar's.\n\nThe Hilton Hotel, which recently announced the removal of shark's fin from its menus, will also participate in the festival with dishes such as Salmon Tartare with Watermelon, Marjoram and Raspberries Vinaigrette (from $33) at its restaurant il Cielo.\n\nSupermarket Cold Storage is also set to expand their existing range of MSC certified products and hold promotions at selected outlets during this one week period.\n\nAccording to Elaine Tan, CEO of WWF, Singapore consumes 140 million kilogrammes of seafood a year, most of which comes from neighbouring countries such as The Philippines that form the Coral Triangle.\n\nKelvin Ng, regional director for MSC Asia-Pacific, says that unfortunately, many of the fisheries within the Coral Triangle have not been certified by the MSC.\n\nHe also explains that ultimately, consumers have the power to change that. \"The reason that fisheries aren't taking that step toward getting certified is consumers aren't asking for it. As such, these fisheries won't spend money to get certified.\"\n\nAt present, consumers can get their hands on tamper-proof MSC certified products at supermarkets such as Cold Storage, NTUC and Sheng Siong. Frozen fish fingers and breaded cod fillets are among the options.\n\nFresh seafood however, remains available only to restaurants through selected distributors. \"It's definitely an eventual goal for the MSC to get fresh seafood out to consumers, but it's hard to ask a business to put out products that people are not asking for,\" says Mr Ng.\n\nHe also explains that awareness remains low as restaurants which may use sustainably caught seafood do not get certified by the MSC. Therefore, the MSC logo is not used on menus and customers are left in the dark about sustainable seafood.\n\nBut the executive chef of Absinthe, Francois Mermilliod, explains that becoming MSC certified is not that simple. \"I would love to explore that idea; even now we use as much sustainably caught seafood as we can. However, to be certified by the MSC, you can only use products with MSC labels. As a restaurateur, it's impossible to survive because the variety of MSC certified seafood at the moment is too low,\" says the chef.\n\nHelene Raudaschl, managing director of Indoguna agrees, adding that the variety of sustainable seafood is still very low and priced roughly 15-20 per cent higher than non-sustainably fished seafood.\n\nHowever, other restaurants such as the Seasons Bistro - set to open on May 5 - says that it is looking into getting certified and using the MSC logo on its menus so as to support the movement.\n\nOther efforts to raise awareness by the WWF include roadshows across Singapore and the distribution of a Singapore Seafood Guide - a pocket-sized booklet that helps consumers choose seafood that is generally sustainably harvested. The booklet, first created in 2010 will be available at all participating restaurants during the week-long festival.\n\nDespite the current low awareness in Singapore, Mr Ng is positive that with the up-coming festival, which WWF and the MSC intend to hold annually, it's only a matter of time before things change.\n\nhychew@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The cost of beans used to make chocolate reached a 30-month high last month, forcing confectioners to charge their customers more.\n\nLucy Armstrong, who sells sweets online from England, said that the cost of a 10 kilogramme pack of bulk chocolate she uses to make champagne truffles, pralines and salty caramels surged 18 per cent this year to \u00a359 (S$123). She has raised the price of chocolate Easter eggs by 50 per cent from last year, just before demand picks up for the holiday on Sunday, and she plans another increase in the next six months. \"It's definitely the first time where the chocolate has gone up quite noticeably,\" she said.\n\nCocoa may rally to US$3,210 a tonne on ICE Futures US in New York by the end of December, the highest since July 2011, according to the average estimate of 14 traders and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. That would be up 6.3 per cent from Thursday's closing price and top this year's high of US$3,039, reached on March 17.\n\nThe US price of cocoa butter, the by-product of crushed beans that accounts for 20 per cent of the weight of a chocolate bar, rose 86 per cent in the 12 months through April 11 and is the highest on average for any year since at least 1997, data from the Cocoa Merchants Association of America show. The cost of other ingredients also are rising, after milk reached records this year in the US and Europe and sugar futures rallied 20 per cent from a 43-month low in January.\n\nWhile global bean production will rise for the first time in three years, reaching 4.104 million tonnes in the 12 months that end on Sept 31, that will be less than demand for a second straight year, with processors set to use 4.178 million tonnes, the International Cocoa Organization said.\n\nSupply concerns are being compounded by increasing prospects of an El Nino weather pattern, which can bring dry winds to West Africa, including top growers Ivory Coast and Ghana.\n\nLong-term output deficits are fuelling \"bullish momentum\" for prices, according to an April 3 earnings statement from Barry Callebaut, the world's top processor and biggest maker of bulk chocolate. The \"significant\" increases in cocoa and milk powder costs were passed on to customers, so profitability wasn't affected, chief executive Juergen Steinemann said.\n\nEven with higher prices, global demand is growing, especially in developing markets including Asia. Seasonal sales of chocolate on holidays including Easter and Christmas will jump 5 per cent this year to US$12.7 billion, Euromonitor said.\n\n\"The underlying concern is that there will not be enough cocoa available to satisfy the appetite of consumers,\" said Andreas Christiansen, managing director of Hamburg Cocoa & Commodity Office, a consultant to the confection industry. \"The growing appetite for cocoa or cocoa-based products in emerging markets is what is driving expectations that consumption will outpace production.\"\n\nIn Germany, where per capita chocolate consumption is the highest in the world at nine kilogrammes a year, confectioners will produce 206 million bunnies for Easter this year, 8.4 per cent more than a year earlier, according to the Association of the German Confectionery Industry. .\n\nConsumers in the Asia-Pacific region will eat 1.096 million tonnes by 2018, a 27 per cent increase from last year, compared with a 5 per cent gain over that period in western Europe, the biggest buyer, Euromonitor forecasts. By 2018, eastern Europe will become the world's No 2 consumer, displacing North America, where demand will be unchanged, the researcher said.

In 1975, Teh Cheng Poh was facing the death penalty for weapons possession when Mr Singh, acting as his counsel, appealed to the Privy Council on the grounds that Malaysia's emergency enactments could be subject to judicial review.\n\nThe Council agreed in a landmark decision that is often quoted by constitutional lawyers. But it was a short-lived victory for Teh, for Parliament subsequently changed the law. Soon after that, appeals to the (United Kingdom's) Privy Council were also abolished.\n\nMr Singh also took on cases that others might have avoided. In 1981, for instance, he took on the case of one Michael Cheah in Singapore. Mr Cheah, a pilot in the Singapore Air Force had not saluted the Singapore flag while on parade, explaining to his superiors that he was a Malaysian citizen.\n\nMr Cheah was later charged with an unrelated offence: failing to take care of secret documents and allowing a businessman to photocopy the minutes of an Air Force meeting. Mr Singh defended him in court and won, something he apparently savoured, according to Tiger of Jelutong, a biography on the man by New Zealand journalist Tim Donoghue.\n\nThe lawyer was not afraid of calling a spade a spade, a quirk that often got him into controversy. He attacked the opposition Islamic Party of Malaysia's - an ally of the opposition coalition - idea of hudud (Syariah) law for criminal matters as something that would happen \"over my dead body\".\n\nIt was an oft-quoted comment that led many Muslims to characterise him as anti-Islamic. It came back to haunt him in death. Zulkifli Nordin, a member of right-wing Malay group Perkasa, tweeted that \"God had removed\" Mr Singh because of his opposition to hudud. There have been other insensitive comments, but most Malaysians, from both sides of the political divide, have largely lamented his loss.\n\nFormer premier Mahathir Mohamad, who had Mr Singh detained under the Internal Security Act in 1987, said that the country needed leaders like him, conceding yesterday that \"Karpal Singh had contributed much to the nation\".\n\nPas's Hadi Awang, whose views on hudud had been strongly criticised by Mr Singh lauded the lawmaker as \"a father, a friend, a veteran politician and a lawyer who never stops from fighting for justice and from upholding the rule of law\".\n\nBut, perhaps the politician's real test came in 2005, when his strength of character showed through. Then, Mr Singh was in the back seat of a Penang taxi - again in the early morning - when a car driven by a banker ploughed into the cab.\n\nA year of operations and treatment proved unsuccessful and Mr Singh was left to face life as a tetraplegic, consigned permanently to a wheelchair. Other people might have retired from public life, but Mr Singh continued both law and politics. Indeed, he successfully defended his parliamentary seat twice after the accident, both times with huge majorities.\n\n\"I have to keep doing what I love most - politics and law - to sustain me or else life has no meaning,\" Mr Singh once said, by way of explanation. And, more recently, he confided to a news-portal that \"I want to die in the saddle\".\n\nHe did, in the wee hours of yesterday morning. And it was no small irony that Karpal Singh, the defender of so many people charged with drug offences, was killed by a lorry whose driver had had his urine test positive for cannabis.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Another 212 million will be placed out to international investors, out of which 25.2 million shares have been reserved for POSH's directors, management, employees and business associates, as well as its subsidiaries, joint ventures and its parent, Kuok (Singapore) Limited (KSL), and its other subsidiaries.\n\nKSL was founded by the Kuok family, which together with its related companies are commonly referred to as the Kuok Group.\n\nIn a separate development, Hwang Investment Management and Fortress Capital Asset Management have entered into cornerstone subscription agreements with POSH to subscribe for 85.6 million new shares at the offer price.\n\nPOSH, which has a fleet of 112 vessels in operation and another 154 vessels on order, said that it planned to use the net proceeds of approximately $374.8 million, after deducting costs, as repayment of part of the outstanding amounts under its revolving facilities, which have been used for working capital and capital expenditure purposes.\n\nWith four distinct operating segments - Offshore Supply Vessels (OSVs), Transportation and Installation (T&I), Offshore Accommodation (OA) and Harbour Services and Emergency Response (HSER), POSH's fleet serves offshore oilfields in Asia, Africa and Latin America. It also plans to broaden its fleet diversification, expand into deepwater offshore accommodation and other high-growth asset classes, optimise its charter mix for its OSV and OA fleet, and expand into new markets which offer significant growth potential such as Australia, Indonesia, Latin America and the Europe, Middle East and Africa region.\n\nIn December, the firm's board of directors gave in-principle approval for a capital expenditure budget of about US$291.5 million, mainly for the further expansion of the POSH fleet in the OSV, T&I and HSER segments in 2014 to maintain growth momentum.\n\n\"Our strong parentage and the commitment of our highly experienced management team have built POSH into the largest Asia-based international operator of offshore support vessels and among the top five players globally. We are therefore well positioned to capture market opportunities across all our business segments, maintaining our growth momentum and, in particular, expand into the deepwater offshore accommodation segment,\" said Gerald Seow, CEO and executive director of POSH.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Improvements in mature economies such as Europe and the US have helped offset the more subdued growth in some emerging markets in recent months.\n\nReferencing the JP Morgan-Markit Purchasing Managers Index, Iata noted that the pick-up in business conditions started to slow towards the end of the first quarter of 2014, with growth decelerating in several major economies, most noticeably China.\n\nIn contrast, premium traffic in the North Atlantic market - which accounts for the bulk of international premium revenues - expanded by 3.8 per cent year on year in February.\n\n\"The performance of this market is consistent with improving business conditions in the US and Europe,\" the report said. \"In March, US indicators of business activity weakened slightly - consistent with the global trend and also reflecting harsh winter conditions - but growth remains at the highest levels since early 2013 and the outlook for the economy remains broadly positive.\"\n\nMeanwhile, improving trade growth in the US and Asia is bolstering growth in the North and Mid Pacific market, which rose 5.6 per cent in February.\n\nPremium air travel on the North America-Central America and North America-South America routes jumped 8.5 per cent and 5.1 per cent, respectively, bolstered by a stronger US economy, as well as robust growth in some emerging markets in Central and South America.\n\nWithin Europe, business travel growth was marginal at 1.1 per cent but strong for routes linked to the Far East (8.6 per cent) and the Middle East (8 per cent) as economic activity in the eurozone expands at the fastest pace since mid-2011.\n\nIata also touched on international trade - which is viewed as an indicator of business travel trends - highlighting that increases in protectionist measures appear to be keeping trade expansion at a similar pace to domestic industrial production. In the past, trade expanded at twice the pace of domestic growth.\n\n\"If this past relationship is not restored, rates of expansion in trade could be limited, as could growth in business-related air travel,\" Iata warned.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A simple statement, intriguing, challenging. Makes you pause. And think.\n\nWhy do we like things, people, food, drink? Confining ourselves to food and drink, things we consume, clearly the simple answer to the question, Why I like the wines I like, can be answered thus: Because I enjoy drinking them! That would be my answer. There are other possible answers, of course, depending on the criteria used. My key criterion is \"enjoyment\". But that raises the question: Why do you enjoy them? Very intriguing. It is obvious that different people will have different answers. What do you look for when you drink wine? Translate that into: What do you (personally) actually, consciously and/or subconsciously look for when you drink a wine?\n\nLast night, I had dinner in a Japanese Yakuniku restaurant. The menu centres on beef. Different sources, different cuts, with different degrees of fat. A very good restaurant incidentally, not exactly cheap but then Japanese beef is not cheap. I chose a La Fleur de Gay 1990 to drink with the meal. A rarely seen Pomerol, relatively unknown, but from a great year.\n\nChateau La Fleur de Gay 1990\n\nBought en primeur 1992. Sadly last bottle! Deep very dark red with brownish notes. Lovely fresh and strong aroma of very ripe matured fruit, lots of black truffles against the orangey base. On the palate, silky, rich mouthful of very ripe berry fruit; dense, very firm body, flavours of black coffee, mixed with very ripe orange flavour and shades of black truffles; finishing very complex, and very long. At peak, will hold easily for another six to eight years. Lovely wine.\n\nLa Fleur de Gay did not exist before 1982. In that year, the owners of Chateau La Croix de Gay, Alan Raynaud and Oliver Lebreton, separated the harvest from the three best parcels of Chateau La Croix de Gay and vinified them separately from the rest of the harvest. The resulting wine was bottled under the name of Chateau La Fleur de Gay, cepage 100 per cent Merlot.\n\nLa Fleur de Gay 1990 was very pleasing, very enjoyable. I kept on reaching for my glass after each swallow. Why? This wine exhibits some of the criteria. The first impression I look for after the initial visible (sight) and aroma (smell) is the \"mouth-feel\". This is the total sensory impressions received when the wine is held in the mouth before swallowing. The taste, the weight, the density, and above all, the degree of freshness or otherwise. My mind registers their messages. \"Fresh\" is, for me, the first attribute I look for, and if it is present, the others take their place in the pecking order. Size, weight, sweetness, ripeness, acidity, tannin, complexity, elegance, balance.\n\nIf the immediate impression is \"not fresh\", this is sad. Something has gone wrong with this wine. And then I look for the rest - such as sweetness and ripeness. Even if they register well, the \"not fresh\" is like a sentence of \"guilty\"! Thereafter, I lose interest and decide the wine is not drinkable.\n\nChateau Latour 2003\n\nEn primeur 2004, 160 euros. (Currently 1,200 euros, or S$2,078). The relative prices show one of the two main advantages of buying en primeur. The other advantage is the ability to bring up the wine to maturity under ideal conditions of storage. I thought it was time that the 2003 Firsts needed testing.\n\nThis bottle was drunk at dinner in a hugely popular Cantonese restaurant, very good food, very reasonable prices, no corkage, excellent wine service, right glasses, including even the bowl-shaped Burgundy glass. All the necessary ingredients for \"Why I like the restaurant I like\"! The last two attributes are particularly important for a wine dinner - several wines, enough glasses.\n\nThese wine service-related attributes are not to be found generally, even in the most expensive, most prestigious establishments, whatever the cuisine - French, Italian or Spanish. In the case of this particular Cantonese restaurant, it fortuitously happens that the owner loves wines. Oh, and I almost forgot, one last advantage: the restaurant itself has an impressive collection of excellent wines, mainly French, at very reasonable prices. And one more attraction: nearly always when you go there, you will find one or more of your wine friends also dining there. Which allows for exchange of glasses of wines, and converting the evening into an almost full-scale wine dinner.\n\nBack to Latour 2003. As wine lovers know, 2003 was a very, very hot and dry year, very small diurnal variation of temperature, a very important factor for good fruit maturity. In addition, there are hailstorms in June and July, in Graves and parts of the Medoc. How well are the wines faring today? The short answer: excellently. Amazingly, it turned out to be slightly on the youthful side, but otherwise was unmistakably Latour.\n\nVery dark, opaque, black-red right up to the rim. Bouquet unmistakably Pauillac, loads of cedar, pencil shavings, tobacco and blackcurrant fruit. Palate a big mouthful, impenetrably dense, very thick, very concentrated, very sweet, very ripe fruit but well balanced by a smooth and attractive acidity - the kind of acidity you taste when you have a lemon drop in your mouth together with blackcurrant juice. Almost at peak, lovely wine. This wine is so good and drinking so beautifully now, there is no real need to wait. Just to observe the way it matures, I would keep a few bottles back to await its 20-year age.\n\nHere are two wines, very likeable. Although this week's column talks about Bordeaux wines, the same approach applies to all wines regardless of where they come from.\n\nWhat do I look for? Above all: freshness, on the nose, on the palate, and in the mouth after wine has been swallowed. After the first mouthful has gone down, it should leave the palate clean and refreshed and thirstily waiting for the next mouthful.\n\nThis first impression takes precedence above all else for me. A refreshed palate, still savouring the wine just swallowed, the flavours still lingering on the palate and in the mind, which is in the meantime trying to memorise and analyse the taste. Both the above wines had this effect.\n\nThese are not very demanding attributes. Wine should fulfil two basic functions. It should quench your thirst, it should please you. The first is easy, unless the wine is so out of condition that however parched your throat is, it would be almost self-sacrifice to use the wine to quench your thirst. Better to remain thirsty.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The new model, which will be implemented in 2016, aims to show students' mastery of concepts taught in high school rather than measure skills and words they might rarely or never use in real life.\n\nThe SAT, which has been losing market share to competitor ACT, is repositioning itself as an achievement test, using \"real-world applications\" of math, reading and science to identify students ready for college. In its initial unveiling of the overhaul last month, the College Board said that the mandatory essay portion, added in 2005, will become optional, students will no longer be penalised for wrong answers and scoring will return to a scale of 1,600 from 2,400.\n\n\"This will be the first admission exam that requires students to cite evidence in support of their understanding of texts in both reading and writing,\" College Board president David Coleman and chief of assessment Cynthia Schmeiser wrote in a letter accompanying Wednesday's examples. Every question will go through \"extensive reviews and pretesting\" to assure clarity and fairness, they said. Mr Coleman acknowledged last month that students and their families are sceptical that the SAT and ACT reflect their best work.\n\nUnder the reading portion of the new test, students will be asked to analyse \"relevant\" words in context. One criticism of the current and previous tests has been the use of esoteric vocabulary that a typical 17-year- old test-taker wouldn't use and acquired only through rote memorisation. Sample questions from practice tests on the New York-based College Board's website list word choices including \"sagacious\", \"trenchant\" and \"raconteur\". An example in the new test would have students reading the following passage: \"The coming decades will likely see more intense clustering of jobs, innovation, and productivity in a smaller number of bigger cities and city-regions. Some regions could end up bloated beyond the capacity of their infrastructure, while others struggle, their promise stymied by inadequate human or other resources.\" They would then need to choose what the word \"intense\" most closely means: A) emotional, B) concentrated, C) brilliant, or D) determined. The only correct answer is B.\n\nThat sample question doesn't appear much different from one on the current test, said Chris Falcinelli, founder of Focus Tutors & Test Prep, Brooklyn, New York. \"Less esoteric and more relevant\" means lower level and easier words, he said. \"Is it really bad that a kid might need to know the words 'sanguine' or 'redoubtable' in order to get an 800 on the Reading SAT?\" Mr Falcinelli said. \"The vast majority of problems on the test don't turn on the difficulty of the vocab. They turn on how well the tester has read them.\"\n\nThe math section will measure problem solving and data analysis, including use of ratios, percentages and proportional reasoning. The test will also promote what it calls founding documents, texts relevant to US history or to \"global conversations\", such as a 1974 speech by congresswoman Barbara Jordan, delivered during impeachment hearings against president Richard Nixon, or president Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.\n\n\"The Board is making a genuine effort to improve the test in the sense of making it more relevant to college work,\" said Robert Sternberg, a psychologist and professor at Cornell University who has studied entrance exams. \"To the extent that one wishes to predict freshman-year grades, it probably won't make much difference because the SAT, ACT and all similar tests are really largely tests of general intelligence.\" WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

But to renowned portrait photographer Annie Leibovitz, these pictures of world-famous celebrities just make up one side of her life - the \"assignments\". The other side, is the \"personal\".\n\nBoth are on display at her exhibition,\n\nAnnie Leibovitz A Photographer's Life 1990-2005\n\n, which opens at the ArtScience Museum today, and she insists they form her life as a whole. As she put it in her foreword: \"I don't have two lives. This is one life, and the personal pictures and the assignment work are all part of it.\"\n\nAlmost 200 of Leibovitz's pictures taken over a 15-year period are on show. Colourful magazine covers side by side with black-and-white family holiday photos. In that decade and a half, she has also lived through some major events in her life; such as the death of her father and of her long-time companion Susan Sontag. But in the same period, her three daughters - Sarah, Susan and Samuelle - were also born.\n\nSome of the most notable photographs that fall under the \"assignment\" category feature images of Queen Elizabeth II, the Obama family, Mick Jagger, Leonardo DiCaprio, and a pregnant Demi Moore in the nude. The last photo caused a controversy when it graced the cover of Vanity Fair in 1991.\n\n\"We were all working on different ways to avoid her (looking) pregnant in the picture. And then I said, 'Let's just do something for you.' And we started to shoot, and I said, 'You know, this would be a great cover,' \" says Leibovitz of the photo during a press tour on Wednesday afternoon. \"We knew it was sensational, but didn't realise it would have all this resonance,\" she adds with a chuckle.\n\nBut even after having photographed countless celebrities and influential individuals, Leibovitz reveals that her favourite picture falls under the \"personal\" category - one of her mother, taken in 1997. \"I see my work as a body of work. (The photographs) are all brothers and sisters to each other... But when I get pushed against the wall about what's my favourite picture, I turn to this picture,\" she says, pointing to a black-and-white portrait of her mother titled My Mother At Clifton Point.\n\nIt's not a picture that can be taken every day, because of the level of intimacy and love for the subject, she reasons.\n\nWhen asked if she has ever been not in the mood to take a photo, Leibovitz smiles and fondly brings up the importance of experiencing moments with her kids instead of always trying to capture them.\n\n\"I believe more in spending time with (my kids), and I see (opportunities for) pictures fly by all the time. You don't stop just because you don't have a camera... I've seen some beautiful pictures go away but (at least) I'm there (with my kids),\" she says.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And this came after the NODX rose by a revised 7 per cent (from 7.2 per cent) in February and against market projection of a 3 per cent dip. The latest trade figures were released yesterday by trade promotion agency International Enterprise Singapore, three days after the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) issued the first-quarter's \"flash\" gross domestic product (GDP) growth estimates, which fell short of expectations.\n\nThe economy barely grew - up only a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent - in the first three months (Q1) of the year from the previous quarter, according to the preliminary estimates. From a year ago, it expanded 5.1 per cent, slowing from 5.5 per cent in the final quarter of 2013.\n\nWhile these estimates were based largely on January and February growth data, economists say MTI could still have factored in March's NODX. So it's unlikely they will be revised down just on account of the latest NODX.\n\nOn the contrary, Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Chua Hak Bin still thinks MTI is likely to upgrade its 2014 GDP forecast to 2.5-4.5 per cent (from 2-4 per cent) when the final Q1 GDP appears in May.\n\nCitigroup's Kit Wei Zheng, ANZ's Daniel Wilson and Glenn Maguire and Credit Suisse's Mr Wan see a possible downward adjustment, but Mr Kit and Mr Wan think it will be due to anticipated poor industrial production numbers in March, which are expected to be released next Friday.\n\nThe NODX may be a key indicator, but economists say it may not give the whole picture of external demand.\n\nNoting the continued big divergence between NODX and factory output, Mr Wan and BAML's Mr Chua agreed with MTI that the electronics NODX could have been deflated because activities which previously would have been counted as electronics shipments, such as some electronics design and research, are now captured in industrial production and reflected in services exports. \"As such, external demand might not be as weak as the headline merchandise export number suggest,\" Mr Wan says.\n\nBarclays' Leong Wai Ho and Bill Diviney say that more electronics have been classified under re-exports (NORX) since last year. The NORX marked a year of uninterrupted strong growth with an 18.7 per cent increase in March, extending a 15.5 per cent gain in February.\n\nThis provides a \"cushion\" to overall export growth, said Mr Chua. Mr Wan noted that re-export activity has \"quite a good historical relationship with the wholesale and retail trade component of GDP\".\n\nAccording to Citigroup's Mr Kit, NORX's strong showing suggests the wholesale trade sector continues to benefit from improvement in regional trade. Song Seng Wun of CIMB points out that while the NODX fell in Q1 (-1.0 per cent), it was a smaller drop than in Q4/2013 (-2.1 per cent) and Q1/2013 (-12.5 per cent). This points to the NODX picking up ahead.\n\nEconomists generally think it will happen in the later half of the year, when markets in the US, Europe and Japan continue to recover. But the upwing in these markets must be stronger to pull Singapore along and that's likely to take longer than before, according to them. Except for China and Malaysia, NODX shipments to all 10 major markets fell last month.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The fresh debacle at Terminal 1, used by foreign airlines, came as millions of Filipinos begin travelling for the Easter holidays during one of the hottest months of the year.\n\n\"We ask for your pardon and patience,\" Mr Aquino said in remarks to reporters aired live on national television. The transportation ministry also issued a separate public apology on Wednesday, on the eve of the four-day Easter holidays in the Catholic Philippines that began yesterday, Maundy Thursday. The apologies came amid numerous complaints by irate travellers this week over inadequate air conditioning in some parts of the airport.\n\nMr Aquino said that the air-conditioning system of Terminal 1, the oldest of its passenger gateways, was undergoing rehabilitation and some of the units had to be shut off. He said that while the government had tendered for replacement parts in November last year, deliveries would only start in August.\n\n\"With the strict rules of government, you cannot just order (an air-conditioning unit) today and have it delivered in just 30 days,\" Mr Aquino said as he made the rounds of Manila's ports and air terminals for safety checks. The Manila airport's Terminal 1 was rated as the world's worst as at last year, for the second year in a row, by online travel website The Guide to Sleeping in Airports.\n\nTravellers criticised its \"dilapidated facilities\", dishonest airport workers - particularly taxi drivers - long waiting times and rude officials in the latest rating. The website had yet to issue its 2014 rankings. Manila airport authorities have been renovating the terminal, built in 1981, but say that the ageing building is handling far more travellers than its intended capacity of six million per year. Despite the official apologies, some critics were not mollified, using social media to vent their ire.AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

In the first half of last year, its counter started at 68.5 cents, broke through two key resistances to reach a high of 85.5 cents on April 22, before ending at 72.5 cents on June 28.\n\nReits were enjoying a good run during that period on positive earnings while other sectors languished. CIT had a \"near-term catalyst which created a bit of buzz\", said DBS Group Research equity analyst Derek Tan: the perceived en-bloc sale potential of its freehold Lam Soon Industrial Building on Hillview Avenue. It eventually divested its stake in the building for $140.8 million last July.\n\nYesterday, board chairman Chua Yong Hua said: \"As you can recall, the trust strongly outperformed the benchmark index last year. We were entitled to a performance fee of $27.7 million. The board took the decision to reduce this by 50 per cent to $13.9 million.\"\n\nThis was done in response to feedback from unitholders over the quantum of performance fees in H1 2013, which spiked steeply, up from just $250,000 in first-half 2012 and $3.3 million in the second half of that year.\n\nThe benchmark index he was referring to comprises nine of the largest SGX-listed Reits. As at April 16, these were Ascendas Reit, CapitaCommercial Trust, CapitaMall Trust, CDL Hospitality Trusts, Keppel Reit, Mapletree Commercial Trust, Mapletree Industrial Trust, Mapletree Logistics Trust and Suntec Reit.\n\nDBS analyst Mr Tan said: \"They were being paid a fairly large amount of performance fee. If they take that performance fee, it would have resulted in a very big drop in DPU (distribution per unit). By halving their entitlement, that's what they are trying to eliminate from happening again, which is a pretty good consideration from them.\"\n\nHe added that most other Reit managers typically peg performance fees to net property income or DPU, unlike CIT's pegging of fees to share price, which is \"more subjective because it's not up to them to decide\".\n\n\"Through this revision, even if the share price outperforms going forward, it will now have a smaller impact,\" he said.\n\nA release the trust sent out yesterday evening said that unitholders congratulated the management for listening to them by amending the performance fees.\n\nOn the stock market yesterday, the Reit's units rose half a cent to 73 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

After dipping into the red for much of the afternoon, the index finished a net 0.6 of a point higher at 3,253.8.\n\nJardine Cycle & Carriage's $1.31 or 2.8-per cent jump to $48.23 stood out, though there were also rises in Jardine Matheson and Jardine Strategic which contributed. Turnover was 1.8 billion units worth $1.2 billion and excluding warrants, there were 235 rises versus 202 falls.\n\nAmong the index heavyweights to finish weaker was Keppel Corp, whose shares lost 20 cents at $10.99 with 6.7 million traded.\n\nIn its \"buy\" report on Keppel, Deutsche Bank said Keppel's balance sheet remains robust with net gearing of 0.14 times as at Q1 and it set a sum-of-the-parts target price of $12.20 for the stock. Credit Suisse (CS) maintained its \"outperform\" on Keppel with a $12.70 target while DBS Vickers (DBSV) also reiterated its \"buy\" with a sum-of-the-parts target price of $12.60.\n\n\"Despite its recent outperformance, the stock is still undervalued ... Keppel Corp remains our top pick in the sector,\" said DBSV.\n\nElsewhere within the STI, casino operator Genting Singapore's shares slipped half a cent to $1.315 with 13.3 million done. CS yesterday maintained an \"outperform\" on Genting Singapore, citing Japan's tabling of a gaming Bill as the main reason as the country currently ranks 30th in the world for tourist arrivals.\n\n\"Gaming operators remain hopeful that Japan will approve the integrated resort Bill ... we believe any progress on gaming legislation in Japan could be a major share price catalyst, given the high degree of investor scepticism on the issue.\" CS said Genting's track record here and strong balance sheet would put it in a strong position to compete. It set a $1.70 target price.\n\nAmong penny stocks, Albedo stood out with a 0.5 cent or 21-per cent slide to 1.9 cents that came with 248.5 million traded, prompting renewed speculation that the Johor land deal that earlier this year sent the stock up to 8 cents looks to be off the table. Other penny stocks that were active included HanKore, Armarda and Charisma Energy.\n\nEzion Holdings, which has recently announced a placement and tie-ups with other listed firms, saw its shares rise nine cents to $2.27 with 31.3 million traded. AusGroup, one of the offshore oil and gas firms with an Ezion connection, was also in the top 20 actives list with a two cents rise to 48 cents on volume of 40.4 million done.\n\nOverall, brokers reported that although prices were firmer, retail presence was still lacking. \"The play is on those stocks which have some kind of major positive news,\" said a dealer. \"Otherwise, there's really still no interest.\"\n\nIn Singapore Residential Property Alert on Wednesday, Citi Research looked at recent land bids for a Prince Charles Crescent site.\n\n\"Given that two different developers won the two adjoining sites, the 15-per cent differential in fact belies what developers who participated in both tenders are factoring into their land bid considerations,\" said Citi.\n\n\"Analysing four developers that participated in both tenders, Wing Tai's bid yesterday was 24 per cent below its Sept 2012 win, City Dev's effort was 21 per cent below its Sept 2012 effort, and Frasers/Far East's attempt was 19 per cent below its Sept 2012 try. UOL won on its second try for a piece of Prince Charles Crescent real estate, with a bid 8.4 per cent off its Sept 2012 bid. This moderation in land prices, in our view, supports the government's decision to pull back on the supply lever for 1H14.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Temasek is offering US$850.37 for every US$1,000 principal amount in convertible bonds, and $0.646 for each warrant.\n\nThe convertible bonds, issued in October 2009, carry a conversion price of $2.98. The bonds mature on Oct 15, 2016.\n\nIn reaching its conclusion, Rothschild noted that the implied value of Olam from Temasek's offer price is above the average and median for precedent transactions in the global agri-commodities space, such as Noble Agri and Graincorp, and comparable companies, such as Wilmar International and Bunge Ltd.\n\nThe implied value for Olam is within the range of precedent takeovers in Singapore, such as People's Food Holdings and China Minzhong Food Corp.\n\nRothschild's opinion on the convertible bonds had been expected by the industry.\n\n\"This is market practice and in line with previous transactions,\" said Choo Oi Yee, UBS head of investment banking in Singapore.\n\nThese include Straits Trading's and United Engineers' offers for WBL Corporation.\n\nTemasek on March 14 launched the offer for all Olam shares that it did not already own through its unit, Breedens Investments, in a deal that values the agri-commodities firm at $5.33 billion. The offer closes on May 9.\n\nThe offer price of $2.23 represented a premium of 11.8 per cent over the last traded price before the announcement.\n\nTemasek has said that it intends to keep Olam listed, but has kept the option to reassess its position if the minimum public-float requirement of 10 per cent is not met.\n\nAs at Wednesday, Breedens and its concert parties own 54.8 per cent of all of Olam's issued share capital and 48.1 per cent of its maximum potential share capital.\n\nThe offer becomes unconditional if the consortium receives acceptances with more than 50 per cent voting rights attributable to its maximum potential share capital before the offer ends, or of all issued shares as at the close of the offer.\n\nOlam's shares, which have been trading at between $2.21 and $2.24 since Temasek launched its offer, closed one cent lower at $2.23 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There are numerous \"experts\" from outside the region who are ready to brush off such dangers as overblown, but the reality of what is happening within the region does not justify such complacency. Even as Mr Tanaka suggested that military confrontation is not the aim of the nations concerned, he admitted that the danger of \"accidents\" is high.\n\nData released recently showed that the number of times that Japanese fighter jets are scrambled nowadays to ward off real or imagined intrusions by their Chinese counterparts runs into the hundreds each year. With nationalism running high in Japan, China as well as in South Korea, tensions seem far more likely to increase than to diminish in the foreseeable future. Thus the key question that springs to mind is who, if anyone, has the power to intermediate and ward off a potential crisis.\n\nThe answer is of course US President Barack Obama who is due to visit leading North-east Asian nations at the end of April. In the past it has been possible for the United States to profit from geopolitical tensions in this region in order to enhance its own power. That, however, would now be a very dangerous policy to continue pursuing. Mr Obama needs every ounce of statesmanship and maturity that he can muster to wind down escalating North-east Asian tensions. There were some vaguely promising signs in this direction when US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel visited China recently ahead of Mr Obama's visit.\n\nAccording to a report inThe New York Times, officials in Mr Hagel's entourage discovered that \"uncertainty lies beneath China's show of strength\". Beijing, the report suggested, \"feels besieged\" by hostile neighbours, including Japan, who rely on US forces to back them up. This is clearly true and it is apparent enough that China feels that its growth and influence are being \"contained\" by US-backed powers that also include the Philippines and by Japanese defence pacts with Australia and India.\n\nWhat Mr Obama needs to do is to cease emphasising the importance of the Pacific alliances, and to make clear to Japan in particular that it cannot continue waving its fist aggressively against its neighbours and relying on the US to back up such menacing gestures with force of arms if conflict erupts. The worst outcome of the US president's visit would be if he simply reiterates, or even reinforces, the US commitment to defend the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea against Chinese incursions under the terms of the US-Japan Mutual Security Treaty. This is what some senior Japanese figures hope for but it would be more provocative than productive.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They have finally been prized higher, by the Chinese themselves, as collectibles these days.\n\nHowever, the measure of their value is really mainly only aesthetic, and based on the eye of the beholder, rather than on their antique qualities, says Victor Mun, a collector and former publisher of an art magazine, Dragon Roots, which went defunct in 1995.\n\nVictor and his wife Irene started collecting snuff bottles themselves in the 1980s, sparked by interest among collectors in North America and Europe. \"Westerners were the first to appreciate the delicate art of the snuff bottles and were the biggest collectors from the 19th century onwards,\" he explains. Giving a brief history overview, Mr Mun explains how the art of the decorative snuff bottle had been started during the time of Emperor Kangxi (1654-1722) of the Qing dynasty, and had been contained within the Imperial court for several centuries, explains Mr Mun.\n\nThe emperor favoured them so much he had an exclusive workspace for the craftsmen in his palace grounds.\n\n\"Royal patronage was the only reason for decorative snuff bottles and they would use it as gifts to the lords and high-ranking officials within the Imperial court. It really wasn't something common or shared with the public.\"\n\nEventually though, as ageing artisans were sent back to their villages and hometowns, they would pass on the skills. \"Guangdong, Shandong and Tianjing were such places especially as they supplied the materials for the bottles,\" Mr Mun says. In the beginning of the 20th century and the start of the Republic of China movement, snuff bottles were then increasingly made available to the general Chinese market, and bought also by foreigners who travelled to China for trade.\n\n\"It is during this time when the art of making snuff bottles became more 'democratic', as it drew different artists, and the influx of newer technology also led to a whole variety of designs,\" he adds.\n\nToday, there are a few thousand snuff bottles in the Imperial collection that remain as part of the museum collections in China, but a lot of Chinese snuff bottles are actually in Western collections, Mr Mun noted. In the 1980s, a British couple put on auction their collection of over 1,000 bottles, which was when the true value of the bottles as cultural, historical and art items were being realised. Their miniature sizes belie Chinese culture, as well as China's trade and diplomatic ties with Europe back from the 17th century.\n\nTo get an idea of how late Asians have come into the scene, points out Mr Mun, the snuff bottle societies in China and Taiwan were formed only in the 1990s, and in Singapore, in 2001. \"Before the 1980s, you weren't able to see snuff bottles in museums. China displayed them first, followed by Taiwan,\" he adds.\n\nBut as to how to appreciate them, Mr Mun and his wife note that it's really all about the aesthetics because it's difficult to ascertain the historical styles of the bottles.\n\nThere are some broad styles linked to the different dynasties in the snuff bottles' 400-year history, but most, if not all, styles can be replicated in modern technology. \"So even if there is a mark or word carved at the bottom of the bottle, it doesn't mean it's really from the era of Kangxi or Qianlong and so on,\" he stresses.\n\nCollectors with a practised eye would, of course, be able to better appreciate fine drawings, or carefully done enamel paint on the bottles. In general, the finer drawings and mix of colours on the bottle would indicate higher prices.\n\n\"That's because it's really difficult to have different-coloured enamel paints on a small surface. The colours all have different melting points, and they have to be fired at just the right temperature after they're painted on,\" explains Madam Irene Wong, pointing out a slightly misshapened bottle that had melted slightly during a firing. \"But we had still liked it because of the exquisite art.\"\n\nColoured glass bottles like the emperor yellow are more expensive than painted bottles. Jade and agate bottles are also more expensive than plain glass. \"The most inexpensive style would be the ones with reverse paintings - with paintings done inside the glass - because anyone could learn that skill and reproduce it today. Even so, there are different levels of the artist's skills,\" she explains.\n\nThe Muns are now clearing some of their collection, which they brought to Singapore at the invitation of Wee Wei Ling, the executive director of Asset Management at Pan Pacific Hotels Group and Parkroyal Group.\n\n\"It was too good a collection to keep to themselves so I asked them to share it,\" Ms Wee notes.\n\n\"We just loved collecting and we started buying snuff bottles wherever we travelled - in flea markets in London and Paris for example - for over 20 years,\" says Madam Wong. \"Now that we're retired, we're finally taking stock of our different art collections and paring them down; and also to make space for other acquisitions as our tastes have also changed over time.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Based on the 221,241 sq ft net lettable area or 92.8 per cent share of the building that Keppel Reit owns, the deal size would work out to nearly $520 million.\n\nKeppel Reit was earlier said to have had an asking price of $2,400 psf of NLA. The top floor of the 30-storey office tower is owned by Prudential and half of the 16th floor is held by a private investor. The building is on a site with a balance lease term of about 81 years.\n\nMajor tenants in the building include Prudential Assurance Singapore, UniCredit Bank and Compass Office. Prudential Tower was among the properties that helped contribute a 14.7 per cent year-on- year increase in Keppel Reit's net property income for the first quarter of this year. The asset was valued at $490 million at the end of last year.\n\nCBRE is thought to be brokering the sale.\n\nSome analysts note that the trust is looking to divest itself of Prudential Tower, which is fully let and hence seen at an already optimal stage, to help partially fund a potential acquisition of Keppel Land's stake in Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 3. Keppel Land is the trust's biggest shareholder.\n\nA stone's throw from Prudential Tower, Capital Square - on a site with similar balance lease term - changed hands for about $2,300 psf or $889 million in 2011.\n\nOffice market players generally describe Prudential Tower's pricing as within expectations, given the relatively large quantum involved of more than $500 million, and the dearth of takers for big-ticket properties currently.\n\n\"If the deal size had been smaller, this asset would have fetched a higher psf price especially since this is a Grade A office asset,\" said an investor.\n\nThere is currently a shortage of local buyers for big-ticket office buildings, and most major foreign property funds prefer to purchase office space in other markets such as Japan (where there is positive carry, ie, property yields are higher than financing cost) and Australia.\n\n\"There are embedded risks in the Singapore office market - such as short tenancies, rental market volatility and low yields,\" said an observer.\n\nAnother market watcher pointed out that many of the Singapore office building purchases in the past few years have been by Asian families looking for a place to park their money for wealth preservation.\n\nKOP has been in the headlines lately with a series of investments. In Shanghai, it is expected to begin developing this year a 13.5 billion yuan (S$2.74 billion) mega winter resort. Recently, KOP Group acquired a majority stake in US-based exhibition production and distribution company Victory Hill Exhibitions.\n\nKOP is also involved in the refurbishment of Fort Canning Centre, which will eventually be home to the upcoming private museum, Singapore Pinacoth\u00e8que de Paris, in 2015. The group has also developed high- end residential projects here.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It also would mark Air NZ's re-entry into Singapore after it pulled out in 2006.\n\nThe two airlines said earlier this year their alliance would increase the total number of flights by them between Singapore and Auckland from 12 to 14 per week, stepping up competition on a route that is also operated by rivals such as Qantas. In time, the two Star Alliance members are looking to raise their capacity between Singapore and New Zealand by up to 30 per cent year round, SIA's CEO, Goh Choon Phong, had said previously.\n\nAs part of the deal, the joint revenue-sharing tie-up means that SIA's passengers will have access via codeshare travel to Air NZ's domestic network and selected international destinations.\n\nSimilarly, the Kiwi carrier will be able to widen its reach to markets on SIA's network in Europe, India, South-east Asia and Africa, in addition to cities served by SIA's regional wing, SilkAir.\n\nThere would be \"varying levels of coordination\" between SIA and Air NZ with respect to revenue sharing, pricing as well as coordination on capacity and scheduling, the CCS said yesterday. It added that it had sought feedback from various stakeholders, including the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, the Ministry of Transport, Changi Airport Group, and Vital Shared Services, a department under the Ministry of Finance. It also conducted a public consultation.\n\nThe alliance is contingent on regulatory approvals in both Singapore and New Zealand.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The 2014 total was boosted by the liquidation of the Irish Bank Resolution Corp, formerly Anglo Irish Bank Corp.\n\nThis year may mark a peak for loan sales after deals soared in the first several months, Federico Montero, corporate finance partner at Cushman & Wakefield, said in a statement.\n\n\"We won't see a quarter like this for quite some time,\" Mr Montero said. \"Investor appetite is at an all-time high, with plenty of capital still to deploy.\"\n\nHolders of real estate loans, including Ireland's National Asset Management Agency, are accelerating sales as economies of countries that use the euro show signs of emerging from the worst of the sovereign-debt crisis.\n\nInvestors have set aside as much as 125 billion euros to invest in European real estate and credit linked to property, Cushman & Wakefield estimates.\n\nRoyal Bank of Scotland Group plc, the lender 80 per cent owned by the UK government after a bailout, may sell as much as \u00a311 billion (S$23 billion) of loans in the next three years, according to the report. Permanent TSB, a Dublin- based lender, plans to sell almost 10 billion euros of assets \"in the near future\", the broker said.\n\nLone Star Funds and its partners are the biggest buyers of real estate loans in Europe so far this year, spending 12.9 billion euros, Cushman & Wakefield said.

Instead, it never gets beyond sloppy, unsophisticated and thoroughly predictable, relying on blondes in bikinis, physical comedy gags involving falling over garden hedges and that old standby - gross toilet humour - to grab our attention.\n\nSmart comedies where women take centre stage (such as\n\nBridesmaids\n\n, 2011) or have fully developed characters (\n\nKnocked Up\n\n, 2007) have proven to be successful in the past but it's fair to say that with\n\nThe Other Woman\n\n, the genre is in full regression. Director Nick Cassavetes and screenwriter Melissa K Stack commit the cardinal sin of creating a comedy that is largely devoid of funny moments.\n\nCarly (Cameron Diaz) is a high-powered New York lawyer with a sassy assistant (Nicki Minaj) and a killer sex life but then she discovers that her suave Prince Charming Mark (Nickolaj Coster-Waldau, a long way from\n\nCasterly Rock and King's Landing\n\n) is a serial liar with a penchant for sharp suits and a wife in the suburbs. It gets worse when Kate (Leslie Mann), the ditsy wife, is given to blubbering a lot and latches onto Carly like a lost puppy. Inevitably, they bond over booze and tips on feminine hygiene.\n\nLater, they discover that Mark has mastered the art of time management by cheating on both of them with blonde bombshell Amber (Kate Upton, who doesn't require a costume change from her\n\nSports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue\n\nshoots). Inexplicably, she too has more fun hanging out with the girls than making out with Mark. Meanwhile, Kate's handsome brother Phil (Taylor Kinney) watches with bemusement from his beachfront home (there are no poor people in movies like this).\n\nNaturally, the women decide that revenge is the best therapy and they set about putting the hurt on Mark. Unfortunately, it's the viewer who will feel the most pain as they subject Mark to a series of personal embarrassments while also making sure that his finances take a major hit.\n\nThe cliches are plentiful and the suspense is sorely lacking in\n\nThe Other Woman\n\n. Comedy veterans such as Diaz and Mann should have known better than to sign up for a movie without a decent script but perhaps they were in desperate need of a beach holiday. On the other hand, viewers in search of a good time at the cinema are advised to look elsewhere.\n\nRating: C-\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Guthrie went on to direct two other Shakespeare in the Park productions - Twelfth Night (2012) and last year's Othello.\n\nThis year he works with Scott Graham from Frantic Assembly, which has made its name in physical theatre - combining movement, design, music and text. The two Scotsmen found a similar wavelength, Guthrie quips, even though it's his first time working with Graham. \"I've wanted to since my fiance had been in one of his productions,\" says the London-based director.\n\n\"Graham's collaboration has been incredibly useful as it gives another dynamic to the production which is also a visual spectacle, and the sets are also enormous and bold,\" he says, adding that the set designer, Richard Kent, is a young, exciting designer from the UK. The rest of the creative team are equally impressive - with several Tony and Olivier award-winners among them, such as Rick Fisher (lighting), Mike Walker (sound) and Ruth Ling, Singapore's Young Artist Award winner, who composed the music.\n\nSo the Singapore audience can expect a very physical, almost action-packed Shakespeare play, staged to be relevant - \"it's a very fast-paced piece, with many scene changes, and it's quite political, but its relevance has increased with time,\" describes Guthrie.\n\nIn the story, Antonio, a Venetian merchant, lends money to Bassanio so the latter can court Portia. However, as he doesn't have cash, he acts as guarantor for Bassanio to borrow money from Shylock, a jewish moneylender. Shylock, who bears a grudge against Antonio, however agrees to lend Bassanio money without interest, but if the loan is unpaid, Shylock is entitled to a pound of Antonio's own flesh.\n\nHis grudge is further compounded when Shylock's servant leaves him to work for Bassanio, and his daughter elopes with one of Antonio's friends.\n\nBassanio wins Portia's hand but Antonio loses his ships at sea and forfeits his bond to Shylock, whereupon the moneylender demands his flesh. Portia and her handmaiden disguise themselves as men of law, peruse the contract and declare that while Shylock is entitled his flesh, to his delight - he can only extract it without shedding Antonio's blood. Even more concessions are obtained from Shylock, and it all ends well.\n\n\"The focus here is on the capacity of power over someone,\" reads Guthrie, pointing out that Shylock's greed is probably also fuelled by his sense of betrayal by his daughter and servant.\n\nThe play is contemporised, and Guthrie also read up on the relationships between high profiled daughters and their fathers, for his approach to the play.\n\nInterestingly, Guthrie's directing of Shakespeare plays has only been done for SRT. Last year, he directed a musical and a movie, so he usually works with a wide range of productions. \"I'm interested in good stories and great actors,\". Was he daunted when he started directing Shakespeare? \"Only because I've got such a high opinion of the Bard's plays myself. Ultimately, my job is to create a world and tell a story,\" he concludes.\n\nThe gates will open at 6.30pm for picnickers, and performances commence at 7.30pm.

We feel this would seriously curtail the participation of speculators.\"\n\nContra trading is the offsetting of a buy with a sell within the three-day settlement period without payment for the initial purchase. After netting off the purchase and sale prices, the trader either receives the contra profit or has to pay the contra loss.\n\nMAS and SGX proposed reducing the settlement period in response to claims that contra trading contributed to last October's penny stock crash. The consultation paper had been issued as part of the reforms proposed in the wake of that crash.\n\nAmong the measures MAS-SGX proposed was 5 per cent collateral for all trades. SOR said that since trades which influence price are usually large, it believes collateral should only be for trades above $50,000. Trades below this amount can be seen as relatively insignificant and do not pose any systemic credit risk to remisiers and broking houses, it felt.\n\nTo compensate for not requiring collateral for trades under $50,000, SOR recommended raising the broking fee for these trades from 0.5 to 0.75 per cent.\n\nAs for short-selling, because MAS-SGX has proposed aggregate position reporting for short sales and public disclosure of short positions, SOR recommended removing the need to mark short sales under $50,000 and withdrawing the $1,000 penalty for settlement failures for these trades.\n\n\"Why harass small investors (and turn them away) by imposing a blanket requirement on all, for administrative convenience, when they are not the culprits behind market crashes?\" said SOR.\n\nIn response to the MAS-SGX proposal to impose a minimum trading price, SOR said that if companies fail to meet this price, there should be a viable alternative trading platform for shareholders.\n\n\"At present, Catalist appears as the only suitable alternative platform but it is a poor solution for two reasons: one, finding a sponsor is not easy owing to a scarcity of sponsors, and two, sponsorship costs may also be too prohibitive for ailing firms to bear.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By closing time, over three-quarters of the stock was sold.\n\nMr Ow Yong will be bracing himself for a bigger turnout this year - \"I've overheard some customers saying they are preparing to queue overnight this time!\" - since expanding Vinylicious to a second, bigger unit across its original store. About 40 cartons containing more than 1,500 records arrived earlier this week; and the selection has increased from 101 titles last year to a whopping 300.\n\nIn total, the number of releases worldwide this year will also hit a record of 608 - a sharp increase from the average of around 200, which has been the norm in past years - because of the number of labels that have jumped on the RSD bandwagon this year.\n\nLoo Hong Keong, owner of Retrophonic Records, reckons that can be a bit too much to handle for indie retailers like himself if they were to order everything. \"Even if you take two copies each per title, that's still a lot!\" he says.\n\nLike Vinylicious, his store will also be celebrating RSD this weekend and Mr Loo will be importing about 200 titles from the list. However, he will be rebranding his event as Phonographic Day because it is set to be an arts and music event featuring collaborations between himself and other artists from outside the music industry.\n\nEverything from his Chinatown Plaza shop has been moved out and Mr Loo will be operating a pop-up store over the long weekend instead at an art space in Commonwealth owned by design and creative collective, FLABSLAB. \"We spent three days packing and hope to sell most of the things there so we don't have to carry all three tonnes of equipment and records back!\" he laughs.\n\nA photo exhibition by renowned local rock photographer Eddie Sung and other art displays including live illustrations will run alongside the sales of about 4,000 records and hi-fi equipment at the temporary location, which is about four times the size of Retrophonic's shop space on Craig Road.\n\nRetrophonic's RSD sales will also begin the moment the clock strikes 12 midnight on April 19, making Singaporeans one of the first in the world to lay their hands on these exclusive titles.\n\nLike Mr Ow Yong, Mr Loo is expecting a big turnout at his pop-up store and has introduced an electronic queue system on Retrophonic's Facebook page. In less than five hours since he started it on Monday, more than 30 people registered their interest.\n\nSome record collectors however might be disappointed to learn not all of the titles might make it to Singapore. \"The US and UK markets get priority before Asia and because the quantity of some titles pressed are so small, supplies run out even before any can be allocated to us,\" reveals Mr Ow Yong, when asked why he isn't carrying Washington rock band, Death Cab For Cutie's live album, one of RSD's most hotly watched titles.\n\nMr Loo adds retailers like himself are also blind ordering when they submit their forms. \"When we send in our orders, we don't really know what will be allocated to us; our order list is more like a wish list where we just tick what we want,\" he explains, before admitting even he has yet to see what has been sent to him so far.\n\nBut a full list of the confirmed titles will be posted on Retrophonic's Facebook page by Friday night while Vinylicious has been updating theirs since early this month - so collectors will know in advance what's available.\n\nMr Ow Yong reckons two live albums by Australian psychedelic rockers Tame Impala and English indie band Foals are set to be hot sellers, judging by how quickly their RSD releases flew off the shelves at his shop last year. He also reckons titles by big acts that have broken up, such as REM And Jimmy Page and The Black Crowes, to move fast because of nostalgia; as will a glow-in-the-dark 12-inch version of the\n\nGhostbusters\n\ntheme by Ray Parker Jr.\n\nMr Loo adds that the belated 7-inch single of\n\nPennyroyal Tea\n\nby defunct Seattle grunge pioneer and recent Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, Nirvana, will do equally well.\n\nThe 1993 track from the band's final album In Utero was planned to be released as a single back then but got scrapped after frontman Kurt Cobain's suicide, making this a collectible that has been 20 years in-the-making. He also says a\n\nCollision Course\n\nrecord, a one-off collaboration by rap giant Jay Z and nu-metal heavyweight Linkin Park, pressed on blue vinyl and available on that format for the first time, is set to be highly sought-after.\n\nOn the local front, two acts have timed their releases for RSD. Math-rockers The Observatory will be putting out\n\nBehind These Eyes\n\n, a double coloured vinyl set featuring remixes of tracks from their critically acclaimed 2012 album Catacombs; as will indie band MONSTER CAT's full-length debut\n\nThe Violet Hour\n\n. Another is\n\nPop Yeh Yeh\n\n, a collection of long-forgotten recordings by psychedelic Singapore and Malaysian bands of the 1960s.\n\nSurprisingly affordable\n\nContrary to popular belief that these limited releases tend to be expensive, prices are surprisingly affordable and almost on a par with normal vinyl releases. Mr Loo says the average price for an album will be in the $35-$40 range while Mr Ow Yong adds 7-inch singles will start from as low as $15, though box sets can go up to $250.\n\nStill, not everything is likely to arrive in time for this Saturday. Mr Ow Yong says because of the sheer number of releases this year, the pressing plants are working overtime but are unable to fulfil every order. Hence, it's never too late to pop by to see if your favourite release is still on sale or a newer one has just arrived. \"Until two weeks ago, more titles were still being added and announced - those might come later - so RSD will definitely go beyond this weekend and into the coming weeks as these titles will be available later,\" he adds.\n\nThat is also partially why Hear Records at Burlington Square has no plans to jump on the RSD bandwagon and participate in it because owner Nick Tan feels there is no reason to just restrict record buying to one particular day or weekend.\n\n\"Hear has always been participating in the context that every day is a record store day and we have been bringing people who love music together since we started,\" Mr Tan writes on a note posted on his store's Facebook page, before adding that he will only be carrying a handful of RSD releases.\n\nHe cites the example of a friend who religiously went to queue for RSD releases last year but yet returned to online shopping again after it was over.\n\n\"Getting people back to independent record stores is a long process and not by effort of a day,\" he continues. \"RSD is much more than just getting limited releases; it's about getting people together and to express ourselves as a community.\"\n\ndylantan@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Overall portfolio occupancy was 90.6 per cent in Q1, down a touch from 91.2 per cent in Q4.\n\n\"Looking ahead, we will continue to intensify our marketing and leasing efforts to improve our portfolio occupancy,\" said Mr Xayaraj.\n\n\"In addition, we will look for opportunities to recycle our capital by divesting underperforming assets and use the sale proceeds to reinvest in new acquisitions, pare down our debt and/or distribute capital gains from divestments to our unitholders.\"\n\nThe distribution reinvestment plan will be applied to the Q1 distribution. Unitholders may elect to receive their distributions in the form of fully paid units instead of cash. Unitholders can expect to receive their distributions on May 30.\n\nSabana Reit ended half a cent higher at $1.085 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The idea of a super-intelligent machine capable of human-like emotions was tackled most recently - and to much better effect - in Spike Jonze's Her while\n\nTranscendence\n\n, directed by Wally Pfister and written by Jack Paglen, is simply unable to stir much in the way of an emotional response.\n\nThis is one of those movies with Big Ideas but its ambitions are hampered by poor pacing, an untidy script and a narrative thread that is far too flimsy at best - there are more holes in it than Swiss cheese. A slew of A-listers do their best to energise proceedings but when Johnny Depp spends most of his screen time in two-dimensional form (speaking in monotone and looking out of a computer screen), even he is apt to lose something on the charisma front.\n\nArtificial Intelligence expert Will Caster (Depp) has a beautiful mind and a noble mission in life: he wants to create a computer brain that is self-aware and self-sustaining. Together with wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) and colleague Max Waters (Paul Bettany), he is close to achieving his dream. But anti-technology radicals led by Bree (Kate Mara) view Caster's attempt at \"transcendence\" as a threat to humanity, so they shoot him with a poison-tipped bullet.\n\nWill is a dead man walking but he can still be saved - in a way - by having his grey matter uploaded into the computer that he helped to create. Evelyn is convinced that her beloved husband has returned from the dead, but Max is not so sure. He has long been conflicted by the struggle between technology's promise and its perils. With her husband at her side (or on her computer screen) and the knowledge of the world at her fingertips, Evelyn builds a high-tech underground lab in the desert. Max, however, is kidnapped by Bree and her associates and spends years in a cave.\n\nMeanwhile, fellow scientist Joseph Tagger (Morgan Freeman) and an FBI agent (Cillian Murphy) are also keeping tabs on Evelyn's advanced research and the danger to humanity that it represents. Together with Max - who has teamed with the terrorists - they employ a series of low-tech tactics to rain on Evelyn's and Will's (or his computer-rendered version, anyway) parade.\n\nTranscendence\n\nmay have been able to survive intact up to this point but when an additional element - to do with tissue regeneration and synthetic stem cells - is introduced to the storyline, there really is no way back. Viewers who are governed by logic may also wish to ask themselves why - when the survival of the planet is at stake - only a handful of good guys are on the case, but that would only be risking major disappointment.\n\nRating: C\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

On Tuesday, it rose to a multi-year high of $22.23 as it has become a safe bet given it's low exposure to China.\n\nThe stock has since fallen slightly, and it closed yesterday at $22.07.\n\nThe all-time high was $24.20 on June 1, 2007.\n\nYear to date, UOB is up 3.91 per cent, while DBS Group Holdings is down 1.17 per cent.\n\nOCBC Bank is the worst performer of the three Singapore banks. Year to date, it's down 5.39 per cent, weighed down by the bank's need to raise capital to fund its $6.23 billion acquisition of Hong Kong's Wing Hang Bank announced on April 1.\n\nMarket players said UOB is benefiting from global funds buying Asia and the fact that it has the least exposure to China where growth has been slowing.\n\nInstitutional funds typically buy bank stocks which are regarded as proxies to the economy when they increase allocation to a country.\n\n\"UOB is everyone's safe bet,\" said one analyst.\n\n\"UOB grew the least (of its China exposure),\" said Kenneth Ng, CIMB head of research yesterday.\n\nIn 2013, UOB's Greater China loans including Hong Kong of S$12.3 billion made up 6.8 per cent of group loans.\n\nDBS' Greater China loans excluding Hong Kong of S$47 billion made up 19 per cent of total loans. OCBC's Greater China loans including Hong Kong of S$27.2 billion is 16 per cent of group loans.\n\nIn a February note post-Q4 2013 results, Mr Ng said for two of the three banks, the Greater China exposure is clearly rising, but both have explained that it is almost solely driven by short-term trade loans.\n\n\"If the intermittent newsflow of imploding China trust funds piles up negative sentiments on China, UOB will be deemed the most defensive, as it has the lowest Greater China exposure and a constant eye on liquidity.\"\n\nChina's National Bureau of Statistics said this week that the world's No 2 economy had expanded 7.4 per cent year on year in January-March.\n\nThe figure was lower than the 7.7 per cent seen in the final three months of last year and marks the fourth slowdown in the past five quarters, putting China on track for its worst annual performance since 1990.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The report found that Singapore's strengths lie in an open trade regime, stable political and legal environment, prudent macroeconomic policies, competitive tax rates, a transparent regulatory environment and an efficient judicial framework, which make it the most attractive base for MNCs to do business in the region. Singapore has held the top position since 2012, displacing its rival Hong Kong, which had topped the league table in the report's inaugural year of 2011. This year, Hong Kong dropped to third place, falling behind second-placed New Zealand, after it scored lower for political stability and the rule of law because of China's more pronounced influence on the special administrative region.\n\nChina itself ranked a lowly 11th, losing out to Taiwan, Japan and South Korea, which were ranked sixth, seventh and eighth respectively.\n\nWith the exception of Singapore and Brunei (ranked fifth), the rest of the Asean member states did not fare well in the index. This prompted Mr Vriens to question their readiness for a common market next year. \"It is important to note that the Asean government leaders will declare in 2015 that the Asean Economic Community (AEC) has been achieved, but it is clear that their aims are very ambitious and the reality on the ground is completely different.\"\n\nHe noted that Indonesia had demonstrated a more protectionist and nationalist stance in its economic policies in recent times, and this is reflected in its 15th rank. \"I am not sure how Indonesia's growing protectionism, for instance, will square with the objectives of the AEC,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Four people were confirmed dead after the ferry listed heavily onto its side and capsized in apparently calm conditions off South Korea's south-west coast.\n\nThe Ministry of Security and Public Administration had reported that 368 people had been rescued and that about 100 were missing.\n\nIt later described those figures as a miscalculation, turning what had first appeared to be a largely successful rescue operation into potentially a major disaster.\n\nThe cause of the disaster was not immediately clear.\n\nMost of those on board were children and their teachers from a high school in Seoul on a field trip to Jeju island, about 100 km south of the Korean peninsula.\n\nThere were 462 people and 150 vehicles on board the ferry Sewol, officials said. Witnesses said many people were likely still inside the stricken vessel.\n\nAn official from the Danwon High School in Ansan, a Seoul suburb, had earlier said all of its 338 students and teachers had been rescued safely but that could not be confirmed by the coastguard or other officials involved in the rescue.\n\nThe school official asked not to be identified.\n\nThe ferry began to list badly about 20 km off the south-west coast as it headed for Jeju.\n\nWithin a couple of hours, television pictures showed the ship, Sewol, lying on its port side. Soon after the ship had completely capsized, with only the forward part of its white and blue hull showing above the water.\n\nCoastguard vessels and fishing boats scrambled to rescue those on board, with dramatic television footage showing rescuers pulling passengers in life vests out of the water by hand as their boats bobbed beside the ferry's hull.\n\nOther terrified passengers were winched to safety by helicopters hovering overhead.\n\nThe ferry left from the port of Incheon, about 30 km west of Seoul, late on Tuesday.\n\nA distress signal was sent from the ship early yesterday, the South Korean coastguard said, triggering a rescue operation that involved almost 100 coastguard and navy vessels and fishing boats, as well as 18 helicopters.\n\nThere was no immediate indication of what caused the ship to list and roll on its side, although one witness told YTN television there had been a \"loud impact and noise\" before it started sinking.\n\nHeavy fog had set in overnight off the west coast, leading to the cancellation of many ferry services.\n\nThe coastguard said one person had been found dead inside the sinking ferry.\n\nAn official from the Mokpo Hankook hospital on the mainland said another person had died soon after arriving at its emergency ward.\n\nTelevision and still pictures showed the stricken ferry surrounded by debris, rescue ships, and inflatable lifeboats.\n\nThe ship, which also carries cars and trucks, has a capacity of about 900 people, an overall length of 146 metres and it weighs 6,586 gross tonnes.

While the Cupertino, California-based company is the world's largest music seller through its iTunes store, customers are listening more to Internet services like Google Inc's YouTube, Spotify Ltd and Pandora Media Inc. Apple last year introduced its own streaming service, iTunes Radio, which it plans to expand outside the US this year, people with knowledge of the plans said.\n\nApple is set to preview the latest update of its mobile software, called iOS 8, at its annual developer conference that will kick off on June 2 in San Francisco. The song-identification feature will be integrated into the mobile software in the same way that Twitter Inc's service is currently incorporated, meaning consumers don't need to separately download it. Among the ways it can be used will be through Apple's voice-activated search feature, Siri. An iPhone user will be able to say something like \"what song is playing\", to find out the tune's details, one person said.\n\nThe song-matching feature could boost Shazam, whose app was an early hit and has steered millions of song downloads through iTunes. The London-based company, with more than 90 million monthly users, has been weighing an initial public offering, Shazam chief executive officer Rich Riley has said. Spokesmen for Shazam and Apple declined to comment on Wednesday.\n\nMusic is a key part of Apple's history, with the iPod music player igniting the company's growth more than a decade ago. While the iPhone and iPad are now more important to its business, the company continues to add new features around music. Apple had 63 per cent of the paid digital download market, researcher NPD Group said last year. Download sales fell last year for the first since the iTunes store debuted, according to Nielsen SoundScan.\n\nApple has been exploring other ways to enhance iTunes Radio, a Pandora competitor it introduced last year. The company is preparing to make the advertising-supported service available in more countries, one person said. In contrast, Pandora is only available in the US because of limitations of the licensing agreements it has with music companies.\n\nApple also has been mulling making iTunes Radio a standalone app instead of including it as a feature inside the iTunes store, one person said. A final decision hasn't been made.\n\nEven as song downloads slow, Apple has tried to boost purchases by asking music companies to give iTunes earlier access to their newest music. In exchange, Apple would agree to sell an entire album, which costs more, rather than just individual songs until the CD is released, two people said. While Apple reached such a deal for the release of Beyonce's most recent album, music companies have been reluctant to strike similar agreements for fear of alienating retailers like Amazon.com Inc, and WalMart Stores Inc.

For a start, each side may shortlist a pool of high-quality stocks for the cross-trading.\n\n\"Currently, investors can already trade shares on the other bourse by routing their orders in a round-about way through two different brokerages on both sides,\" said Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) chairman Lee Sush-Der. \"But if there is one single window to trade each others' shares, one layer of brokerage fees is removed and the overall costs will be lower.\"\n\nMr Lee, who was also Taiwan's finance minister from 2008 to 2012, led a delegation to Singapore this week to promote Taiwan's capital market to brokerages, funds, insurance firms and South-east Asian companies.\n\nIt was at his meeting with Singapore Exchange (SGX) chief executive Magnus Bocker on Wednesday when the idea of a cross-border trading connectivity between Singapore and Taiwan was mooted. SGX and TWSE have formed a working group to discuss the specific mechanisms, such as trading, clearing and settlement systems, computer systems and marketing.\n\nWhen approached by The Business Times, SGX said it will continue to strengthen its partnership with its counterparts in Taiwan \"and be open to any opportunity and collaboration that may benefit our shareholders, customers and the Singapore marketplace\".\n\nSGX has a similar tie-up with the London Stock Exchange that allows SGX members to trade FTSE 100 securities on the Singapore bourse's GlobalQuote Board, and LSE members to trade 36 securities of Singapore's leading indices on the London exchange's newly created International Board.\n\nIn its efforts to internationalise faster, TWSE is also wooing Singapore companies to list in Taiwan by way of direct listings or secondary listings via Taiwan Depositary Receipts (TDRs). A few Singapore companies are in the pre-IPO consultation stage with TWSE, Mr Lee said.\n\n\"But encouraging foreign listings is a continual process, while cross-trading of shares is something that can be done in the short run,\" he added. \"Hopefully, by the end of the year, we would have come up with a viable system.\"\n\nTWSE started to internationalise since 2008 with the TDR regime but its efforts have met with limited success. As of last year, less than 7.4 per cent of all issuers on TWSE were foreign companies. Of about 27 TDR listings by foreign companies, eight are from Singapore companies.\n\nGrowth in foreign participation has also slowed in recent years. The market value on TWSE held by foreign investors was 16.3 per cent of the overall market in 2000. It rose significantly to 34 per cent in 2006 but has hovered around that level since. The trading value of foreign investors accounted for 24.6 per cent of the total market last year.\n\nMr Lee conceded that a smaller institutional investor base is a bugbear for TWSE, as retail investors still account for 60 per cent of its securities turnover.\n\nTaiwan's Asian Pay Television Trust listed in Singapore last year as a business trust, while private equity fund MBK Partners was said to be considering a business trust listing for China Network Systems, Taiwan's largest cable television operator, here.\n\nThere is no framework in Taiwan yet for business trusts listings; there are less than eight real estate investment trusts (Reits) listed in Taiwan.\n\nMeanwhile, restrictions on direct listings for mainland Chinese companies are still in place. Mainland companies can only undertake secondary listings in Taiwan via TDRs and use the proceeds for operations in mainland China.\n\nMore deregulation is in TWSE's favour, but political dynamics and the timing of deregulation still depend on Taiwanese regulators, Mr Lee said.\n\nShanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges are planning a direct link that will allow investors in Hong Kong and Shanghai to cross-trade shares. When implemented, Hong Kong investors can buy and sell shares on Shanghai Stock Exchange for the first time outside of China's qualifying schemes.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Interested parties are invited to submit their views and comments to the MAS by July 11.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The last time home value sales dropped in the first quarter was in 2012. New property construction declined to 291 million square metres in the quarter.\n\nChina's broadest measure of new credit in March fell 19 per cent from a year earlier and money supply grew at the slowest pace on record, according to People's Bank of China.\n\nChina's expansion slowed to the weakest pace in six quarters in the January-to-March period, a separate government report showed yesterday, adding to risks of missing an annual growth target of about 7.5 per cent.\n\n\"The big drop in new property construction was a surprise and it shows that developers, mostly non-listed, are concerned about the property market outlook and holding off home- building,\" said Jinsong Du, a Hong Kong-based property analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG. \"Tight credit, with less money flowing in the market, is the main reason for the weakening sales.\"\n\nUnlike his predecessor that imposed nationwide property curbs, Premier Li Keqiang last month said the government will regulate the housing market differently in different cities to take into account local conditions.\n\nAgricultural Bank of China Ltd, the nation's third-largest lender, this month alerted its branches about risks from property lending, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nOnly two banks offered discounts on mortgage lending rates for first home buyers, according to a China Real Estate Information Corp's report on April 9, citing its telephone survey conducted in February, which covered 69 banks in 22 Chinese cities.\n\nInvestment in homes, office buildings, malls and other types of real estate climbed 17 per cent to 1.53 trillion yuan in the first quarter, according to the statistics bureau.

The US and Japan, two of the world's biggest markets tipped to continue doing well after unexpectedly spectacular gains last year, are both in negative territory in 2014.\n\nTech stock valuations are coming back to earth in the US, while investors in Japan have been disappointed by the lack of further stimulus from the country's central bank.\n\nMeanwhile, the unloved markets of yesteryear, such as Indonesia, India, and Brazil, are making a comeback. Even China, the teetering giant investors bailed out of last month, has rallied in recent weeks.\n\nObservers explain the anomaly by saying that some emerging markets have looked cheap by comparison to developed ones in terms of earnings multiples, and a bounce was inevitable after an intense selldown.\n\nBut they caution that the political risk, current account deficits and credit growth problems emerging markets face have not gone away. Election hopes in India and Indonesia have also gone too far, some say.\n\nRuss Koesterich, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist, said in an April 7 note that the week before marked the first time in five months that flows into emerging markets funds were positive, and \"value styles are looking increasingly attractive\".\n\n\"The investor penchant for value seems to have taken them to one of last year's most notable losers . . . this move is not necessarily unexpected, since we have been saying for some time that emerging markets offer compelling long-term value,\" he said.\n\nNikko AM head of Asian equity Peter Sartori said last year's selldown in Asian equities was so severe that there had to be a technical recovery at some point.\n\nAsian equities have outperformed other emerging market commodity exporters such as Russia and Brazil over the past few years as Asian countries are mostly net importers, and benefit from lower prices, he said.\n\nJohn Vail, Nikko AM's chief global strategist, noted that this year's developments have been \"quite surprising\" as he is not positive on emerging markets yet, even though the US has been looking expensive.\n\n\"We think equities will go up, but very mildly this year. It is not worth taking a lot of excess risk,\" he said. \"Valuations rose tremendously last year, they are not bubble-like, but are getting there.\"\n\nYet he said the \"fragile five\" characteristics are still out there - referring to a Morgan Stanley-coined term describing Turkey, Brazil, India, Indonesia and South Africa.\n\nThese countries faced high inflation, weakening growth and growing current account deficits. Their currencies plummeted last year as foreign investors bailed out once the Federal Reserve hinted at tapering its monetary stimulus. Investors preferred to move money to reap potentially higher rates in the less risky developed world.\n\n\"It's not like things that bothered us and many people last year were gone. A significant (issue) is political risk whereby urban classes of all these countries are now demanding more, and at the same time the government can't give them much more.\"\n\nIn India and Indonesia, in particular, markets have rallied on hopes of reformist governments taking over. India is up 8 per cent in Singapore dollar terms this year. The country goes to the ballot box this month and the next.\n\nUBS Wealth Management's regional chief investment officer Kelvin Tay has upgraded India to \"neutral\". \"We believe that in the run-up to the elections, capital inflows will likely continue,\" he said.\n\n\"Offshore debt raising and foreign institutional investments have been strong recently and are likely to remain so, supporting the rupee and MSCI India further.\"\n\nIndonesia is up 20 per cent, but observers are cautious. Markets have come off after PDI-P, the party of Jakarta governor Joko Widodo or \"Jokowi\", garnered fewer votes than expected.\n\nThey say Mr Joko is likely to face problems putting together a coalition to govern, and Indonesian stocks look overvalued with earnings multiples of 24, above its 10-year average of 15.\n\nIn an April 11 note, Deutsche Bank described elections in India and Indonesia as \"more exuberance than substance\". \"No amount of electoral triumph will change civil society's opposition to expansion of mining or fast acquisition of land to proceed with large scale infrastructure development,\" it said.\n\n\"Similarly, getting the support from local governments, headed by opposition parties in many cases, will remain as challenging after the elections as it has been before.\"\n\nThailand is another notable outperformer in Asia, having risen 8 per cent this year. Investors have returned after a selldown following political instability in Bangkok at the end of last year.\n\nThese three idiosyncratic examples do not indicate a shift in sentiment in emerging markets versus developed ones, said Phillip Futures analyst Howie Lee.\n\nHe noted that given the world economy is nowhere near its peak in terms of the business cycle, there could be further upside for developed market equities - though they are looking fairly valued and investors should not expect the massive gains of 2013.\n\n\"Traditionally developed market equities are valued at a premium because of their higher cash flow certainty, stronger business regulations, lower country risk as well as easier access to credit. These qualities are still very prevalent today,\" he said.\n\n\"It will take many years more, at least a decade in my opinion, before emerging markets are able to match developed markets in these aspects.\"\n\nSimilarly, Fidelity chief investment officer Dominic Rossi is keeping a \"very bullish view\" on US stocks. \"Current volatility is a natural consolidation in a longer-term bull market advance that affords buying opportunities,\" a Fidelity spokesman said.\n\nMr Tay of UBS, meanwhile, reckons that the current pessimism on MSCI China is overdone. The market is trading at eight times forward earnings, a 25 per cent discount to its five-year average and regional peers in MSCI Asia ex-Japan. He also likes Taiwan and expects its dominant semiconductor industry to pull the country ahead in the next few quarters.\n\nOverall, the biggest worry in Asia is how productivity gains have slowed and credit intensity has jumped, said HSBC co-head of Asian economics research Frederic Neumann in an April 14 note. \"Sustainable growth requires the former, the wobbly sort is more reliant on the latter,\" he said.\n\nBut a saving grace is likely to be how financial systems are still flush with liquidity, he said. US central bankers are keen to maintain the impression that rates will stay low, Europe is talking about more monetary policy easing, and Japan could start another round of stimulus later this year, he noted.\n\n\"The region needs to prepare for the day that interest rates will climb - that may seem far off, but eventually they will.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its completion is subject to certain conditions being met, including a satisfactory due diligence outcome. It is not expected to have any material financial impact on the group for this year ending Dec 31.\n\nShares of CapitaLand edged up further by two cents to $3.13 yesterday while CMA shares were unchanged at $2.19, after their run-up on Tuesday on news of the delisting offer for CMA.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That means wine lovers here now have access to over 4,000 bottles offered by the family-owned company - including those served at Buckingham Palace.\n\nAnd, while that might sound like awfully expensive wine, BB&R's chairman, Simon Berry, says the reverse is true.\n\n\"Buckingham Palace is not just the Queen's house. It's where heads of state meet, and there's a lot of entertaining done there - whether it's for a reception of 300 people, or for lunch parties of four. So it's a bit like a hotel; you need to have a wide range of wines, (most of which) are probably not the most expensive, in fact.\"\n\nHe would know - as Clerk of the Royal Cellars since 2008, Mr Berry heads a committee tasked with choosing wine for the Queen. No amount of prodding will make him spill on the British matriarch's drinking preferences, though.\n\n\"The most important part of (my appointment) is looking after the Queen and the royal family as we would private customers . . . That includes being incredibly discreet about it - we won't talk to wicked journalists about what (any of our clients) have bought from us,\" says Mr Berry with a grin.\n\nMuch like other foreign firms, BB&R is looking to use the Republic as a launchpad to the rest of Asia. In particular, the company is hoping to grow its presence in the key markets of Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines.\n\nBut the company is also eyeing Singapore for its own domestic market. In addition to the scores of high net worth individuals here - of which there are certainly plenty - BB&R is also interested in cultivating the burgeoning wine scene in Singapore.\n\n\"The Singapore market itself is arguably the most sophisticated wine market in the whole of Asia,\" says Mr Berry, who thinks Japan might come a close second. \"People are now much more interested in niche (bottles). It's not a question of saying: 'Look at me, I'm drinking the same (wine) as all my friends.' It's now a question of saying: 'I know enough about this, and you, my friend, know that I know enough about this. And I'm going to come up with something you've never tried before'.\"\n\nIntroducing customers to rare and fine wine is exactly what BB&R has done in Britain for the past 316 years. And with its new office and tasting room at Amoy Street, the company is now itching to do the same here.\n\nAs part of a series of educational seminars, BB&R plans to fly in some of its eight Masters of Wine, who are best described as wine wizards who have aced gruelling blind-tasting tests. It also wants to reach out to the average Singaporean as well, through affordably priced bottles starting from S$25.\n\nBut for richer millionaire and billionaire folk, BB&R will not disappoint either. Its most expensive offering, a Magnum of 1971 La Tache, Domaine de la Romanee Conti, will set you back a cool \u00a326,500 (S$55,670).\n\nAs a British company steeped in tradition, BB&R has traded from the same shop at No. 3, St James's Street since it was established in 1698. Its colourful history is peppered with anecdotes that are both chilling and charming. For instance, framed at the back of its London shop is an original letter, dated April 15, 1912, informing the company of the loss of 69 cases of wine and spirits that sank while on board the Titanic. BB&R also supplied smugglers with contraband alcohol during Prohibition-era America. But all that history doesn't mean BB&R is old-fashioned, insists Mr Berry.\n\n\"Everyone assumes we must be very ancient and covered in cobwebs and that we haven't moved at all since when we were founded,\" he says, before pointing out that BB&R had its first website up and running in 1994 - a year before Amazon did.\n\nIn addition to being the first wine merchant to launch a website, it also created the world's first online wine trading platform in 2013, known as Berrys' Broking Exchange (BBX). There, wine aficionados can bid on over 4.5 million bottles of wine stored by BB&R, but owned by its customers. The company charges a 10 per cent commission on every sale - about half the rate charged by auction houses elsewhere.\n\nBB&R has also launched iPad and iPhone apps which allow customers to browse through its list of wines and spirits, complete with maturity guides and tasting notes.\n\nPerhaps counter-intuitively, Mr Berry credits BB&R's ability to re-invent itself to the fact that the business has been passed down through the generations. \"There's one thing that new generations of every family do, and it's that they always rebel . . . The children come through, and say: 'Why are they doing it like this, we want to change it.' And that's very healthy for the business, as long as change is coming from people who understand the business through and through,\" says Mr Berry, who has been at BB&R for 30 years and represents the seventh generation of his family.\n\nUnder his guidance, the firm is innovating not just on the technology front, but also in terms of its geographical footprint. With deep roots planted in the UK, BB&R is stretching its reach to other parts of the world, and now has operations in the United States, Dubai, Japan and Hong Kong. Today, Singapore's contribution to BB&R's overall revenue is negligible, while Asia makes up 15 per cent. The company is aiming for that to jump to 50 per cent, with Singapore and South-east Asia making up 30 per cent of that. A daunting task, to be sure. But Mr Berry says the highlight of his job is guiding the business towards its next 300 years - and he's hoping Asia provides the next high.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

His provocative move is said to be the invention of conceptual art, and one of its readings was that art was something you p***ed on. Seventy-seven years later, in 1994, two artists relieved themselves on a replica of Duchamp's Fountain in order to \"restore\" the urinal to its right function.\n\nFrom there, Chinese artist Wu Shanzhuan and his collaborator, Inga Svala Thorsdottir from Iceland, developed their signature Things Rights, patterned after the Human Rights Charter, which contains 30 articles about the rights of things.\n\nWu, 54, is one of the leading figures of the 1980's pre-Tiananmen Square generation of Chinese Conceptualists, and Inga Svala Thorsdottir, 48, started Thor's Daughter Pulverizing Service in 1993, reducing all things back to its powder form.\n\nSince the 1990s, the duo have been known for their intense, research-driven practice, and a peculiar brand of logic and language which challenges the status quo and questions our belief systems.\n\nThey've merged their language-based, historically informed practices, and created such works as To Buy is To Create (1992-2005), a lightbox printed with the titular slogan and a bar code, foregrounding the link between art and consumption and the long tradition of artists transforming everyday objects into works of art.\n\nAlthough Wu was initially reluctant to attend the residency at STPI, he was eventually won over by Thorsdottir's persuasion that they could now investigate a new way and format to present their work. \"We had to think of how we could profit from being here... and finally realised that we could explore the layering of our works since the 1990s,\" explains Wu.\n\nWorking like an archaeologist, but in reverse, the artists decided to layer all the different concepts of their body of work in the past 20 years onto prints so they all merged into one. In this exhibition, viewers need to know, like archaeologists, what they are looking for to best appreciate the duo's works.\n\nThe 30 new works present the artists' evolving humanist ideology in print and paper. They started with the artists' foundational symbol, the Perfect Bracket, as defined by the overlap of both arcs and subversion of common thought for brackets to include or exclude anything.\n\nThis central motif is the basis of their work that continues to evolve into complex geometrical formations and new philosophical insights - as is evident in the polygonal shapes of Seven Circles Little Fat Flesh, What A Form, Little Fat Flesh and infinite tessellations in the Perimeter of Little Fat Flesh series.\n\nFrom there, other symbols of their works have been layered in: the enigmatic arctic fox that embodies the artists' concern of human impact on nature, shopping naked in a supermarket for \"forbidden\" fruit impersonating Durer's Adam & Eve, an obsessive pursuit of Mono-Sex Butterfrogs, and so on. Underpinning the art are the 30 articles derived from Thing's Right(s).\n\nIt's a maze of strange ideas and a peculiar language that have become powerful concepts in their art-making, to open new attitudes.\n\nIn layering the symbols onto printed paper, Wu and Thorsdottir say that they never once thought about how it would come out aesthetically. \"We just knew they would come out fine.\"\n\nThe other thing that pushed their practice was the quality of the facilities at STPI, says Thorsdottir, which gave them the chance to demonstrate their ideas through another medium. She refers to the single colour prints with the Perfect Bracket embossed on them. \"This has been the result of our investigation of the geometric form in the last 20 years,\" she says.\n\nThe artists met in 1991, studied for their master's in Hamburg, Germany together, and have collaborated since. They live and work in Hamburg, Shanghai and Reykjav\u00edk. The Thing's Right(s) pocket manifesto is now available in over 10 different languages - with the second Mandarin version, the Tamil and the Malay versions created at STPI.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its $230 million profit, $22 million or 11 per cent higher than last year, was the largest contributor to group net profit with a 68 per cent share. This was followed by property division with 18 per cent share and the infrastructure division with 9 per cent.\n\nRevenue from the O&M division grew by $217 million (13 per cent) to $1.92 billion. Major jobs completed and delivered during the quarter included the Maersk Intrepid jack-up rig and an FPSO upgrade.\n\nRevenue from its property business improved by $32 million (10 per cent) to $330 million and its infrastructure business was reduced by $21 million (3 per cent) to $736 million.\n\nNew orders for the O&M division won in the first quarter amounted to about $1.9 billion while net orderbook stands at a record of $14.4 billion as at end-March 2014, with visibility into 2019.\n\n\"Growing global energy demand and a stable oil price of above US$100 a barrel continue to support global E&P (exploration & production) spending, which is still expected to grow in 2014, albeit at a slightly slower pace of 6 per cent, compared to 7 per cent the year before. In Latin America alone, E&P spending is projected to rise by 13 per cent in 2014, led by countries such as Mexico.

Conversion to multi-tenancy usually also results in less net lettable area because some space has to be put aside for common area.\n\nStripping away the effect of the straight line rent adjustment, the drop in net property income would have narrowed to 6.9 per cent.\n\nDuring the quarter, the trust completed the acquisitions of 30 Teban Gardens Crescent and 11 Chang Charn Road for $73 million.\n\n\"These two properties will start to contribute from Q2 2014 onwards,\" said Philip Levinson, the trust manager's CEO. \"On the leasing front, we have proactively managed the 2014 lease expiries to spread the weighted average lease expiry beyond 2017.\"\n\nSeven of its properties have head leases expiring in FY2014. CIT said that it would probably lease one property to a head lessee, divest itself of two properties and convert the other four to multi-tenancy.\n\nCIT's gearing ratio stands at 29.9 per cent. Its $50 million three-year Singapore dollar medium-term notes mature next March. The trust expects to refinance this debt ahead of its maturity date.\n\nAs at end-March, CIT had 48 properties in Singapore, with 7.8 million square feet of gross floor area leased to 146 tenants.\n\nIn the stock market yesterday, the trust ended half a cent lower at 72.5 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It was then extended until end-May 2014.\n\nFrom June 1, StarHub customers on the SmartSurf Lite, SmartSurf Value, SmartSurf Premium and SmartSurf Elite 3G plans will pay an additional $2.14 a month for 4G access.\n\nExisting users can opt out of the service by responding to an SMS notification.\n\nCustomers on its SmartSurf HD plan will continue to have free 4G service.\n\nA higher \"usual price\" of $10.70 per month also looms, as the monthly $2.14 fee is pegged as a \"promotional rate\" on StarHub's website. SingTel and M1 also cite a monthly subscription of $10.70 as their usual price.\n\nStarHub's promotional rate of $2.14 will hold \"until further notice\", it said.\n\nOver at M1, a spokesman said: \"We waived our 4G VAS charge as a launch promotion of our 4G network in September 2012. We are currently reviewing our charges with the upgrade of our nationwide 4G network to support speeds of up to 150 megabits per second (Mbps) and the introduction of high-quality voice calls over our 4G network in the coming months.\"\n\nAccording to M1's website, the monthly subscription for the 4G VAS is \"waived until Dec 31, 2014\".\n\nAt SingTel, the telco \"regularly\" reviews its price plans, it said yesterday.\n\n\"Our focus is on enhancing the mobile data experience for our customers by rolling out network upgrades, such as doubling the maximum speed of our 4G service to 300 Mbps later this year,\" its spokesman said.

As with the profit guarantee, he says more could have been done to seek other sources of funds.\n\nBesides promises to review the terms of the RTO and seek out alternatives, Mr Tan gave shareholders new details on his plan to turn the company around should his ouster prove successful. He proposes a revival of Pteris' old subcontractor business model, and the re-hiring of past Pteris management personnel.\n\nShareholders will judge Mr Tan's proposal with their votes at Pteris' EGM next Friday. Shareholders will also get the chance to speak to the current board at a dialogue on Monday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Special flooring soothes legs weary from a long day's work. Ten-foot-high doors offer easy passage between spacious rooms. A high-tech ventilation system eliminates even the worst odours. Most crucially, there's a state-of-the-art hayloft.\n\n\"It's definitely high-end accommodations,\" said Barry Gelbman, deputy inspector and commander of the New York Police Department's mounted unit. \"They're some of the nicest stables I've ever seen.\" This summer, Mr Gelbman will move the unit's headquarters and a dozen of its horses and 20 officers into their new home on the ground floor of Mercedes House, which since 2011 has been home to about 1,000 humans.\n\nAfter a decade, the mounted unit is leaving behind its stables at Pier 76, now a part of Hudson River Park. While there are a handful of stable-centric subdivisions in places such as Colorado, Montana and Florida, Mercedes House appears to be the only corral in the United States inside an apartment building. Even in crowded Manhattan, it is an unusual arrangement. Officers on horseback may seem quaint, but they play an important crowd-control function in Times Square, during parades and at other major events. But the community has been eager for some time to have the police department vacate Pier 76. As part of the Hudson River Park Act of 1998, the horses, along with a police impound lot, were to relocate so the pier behind the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center could become public open space.\n\nIn 2007, Jed Walentas rode to the rescue. Mercedes House was to be his first large project independent of his father, David Walentas, who almost single-handedly developed Dumbo, Brooklyn in the 1990s. Their firm, Two Trees Management, had purchased an 8,100-square-metre Verizon parking lot with plans to replace it with a mix of luxury and affordable apartments. When Mr Walentas had his initial meeting with the community board, he was going to offer to build a school within the 1.1-million-square-foot project, a common salve for large luxury developments.\n\n\"The first thing they asked me about wasn't affordable housing or shadows, it was if I'd build them a horse stable,\" Mr Walentas recalled. \"I thought they were joking.\" He was understandably apprehensive.\n\nMercedes House, as the name suggests, was to be an expertly engineered luxury good, 32 storeys of sleek apartments with more amenities than come standard in an E-class sedan. (Beyond adding cachet, the building's moniker comes from a Mercedes dealership along 11th Avenue, the other ground-floor tenant besides the police department.) To mar that with a mountain of manure presented a serious risk to the nascent project.\n\nBut Mr Walentas said he was open to being persuaded - it helped that his father and mother own a horse farm in Bridgehampton, New York - so he took a visit to Pier 76.\n\n\"They run a first-rate operation,\" Mr Walentas said. \"Between that and my family's experience, we started to get comfortable with the idea.\"\n\nTwo Trees has worked inside decrepit, sometimes toxic industrial buildings and faced numerous City Council and community fights, including a showdown with the historian David McCullough over a project beside the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nDesigning an urban stable within a luxury apartment building was no small challenge, either. \"We're essentially building a barn, which is usually an open-air structure, inside a much larger building,\" said Sebastian Touzet, principal at WASA Studio A, the firm that designed the stables.\n\nThe maze of silver ducts snaking through the ceiling, along with a flotilla of fans, work not only to control any barnyard smells, dander and dust, but also to keep the horses, which are used to living outside, comfortable. \"These are animals, so what's ideal for humans isn't necessarily ideal for horses,\" Mr Touzet said.\n\nBut like humans, they still have to eat and bathe every day without causing a commotion. That custom hayloft was designed to accommodate a week's worth of food, to cut down on deliveries. A special trash bin was installed to deal with the manure.\n\nThere's even a small smithy for working on horseshoes. The signature feature of the space is the corral, which is at the front of the stables. This allows passers-by to spy the horses through small windows along the sidewalk. \"The community has welcomed us, so we want to try and return the favour,\" Mr Gelbman said.\n\nThat the mounted unit needs to shack up alongside hundreds of luxury apartments underscores just how expensive Manhattan land has gotten, as well as how tight city budgets are. Public-private partnerships such as the one between Two Trees and the police department have grown common over the past decade, with public works including schools, libraries and recreation centres springing up inside private apartment towers.\n\nThe clatter of horseshoes on blacktop is already part of the ambience outside Mercedes House. The Central Park carriages regularly use West 53rd Street as a route back to one of their own stables on West 52nd Street just across 11th Avenue. Their hoof-falls could cease if Mayor Bill de Blasio has his way and shuts down the carriage industry. He has taken no offence to mounted police, but some residents of Mercedes House find the practice to be unfortunate.\n\n\"The use of horses in the city is just so sad to begin with,\" said Oksana Harris, who has been living for almost a year at Mercedes House with her boyfriend Omar Niazi. \"But I guess if we have to have a mounted unit, it's pretty cool, and it does make me feel safer,\" she continued. \"I just hope they don't smell.\"\n\n\"Maybe we can host a rodeo,\" Mr Niazi joked. There already has been a horse show of a sort: A few months ago, an event in the lounge featured a pony, said a resident, Jack Gambelini. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

Industry body International Air Transport Association (Iata) said last month that airlines globally expect to make US$1 billion less profit this year than previously hoped, as the Ukraine crisis pushes up oil prices.\n\nResearch firm S&P Capital IQ said in a report last quarter that earnings of flag carriers, especially top-tier airlines, will be pressured by intense competition from low-cost carriers and relatively firm jet fuel prices, even as the Asian airline industry's overall profits for 2014 rise.\n\nJapan Airlines (JAL), Asia's second-biggest airline by market value, is hedging about 40 per cent of its fuel consumption in the 2014 financial year, similar to volumes seen in the previous year, a spokesman of the airline said.\n\n\"Hedging helps us to reduce the risk of volatile and potentially rising fuel costs in the long term. This hedging will be operated monthly,\" the spokesman said.\n\nANA Holdings Inc's hedge ratio for its 2014 financial year is 45 per cent, similar to the 2013 and 2012 financial years, said a spokesman for Japan's largest carrier.\n\nKorean Air Lines generally keeps its hedging volumes around 30 per cent of its annual fuel consumption and this year is no exception, a spokesman said.\n\nThe spokesmen of JAL, ANA and Korean Air declined to divulge price details of their hedges.\n\nConsulting firm Energy Aspects estimates Asia's overall availability of jet fuel at nearly 2.491 million barrels per day (bpd) in the fourth quarter of 2014 versus demand of 2.412 million bpd. The last quarter of a year is typically the busiest for airlines due to holiday travel.\n\nBrent crude has averaged US$108 a barrel so far this year against 2013's average of US$109. And jet fuel has averaged US$121.20 a barrel this year compared to US$126.62 last year and US$125.95 the year before.\n\nAirlines may hedge a big portion of the fuel purchases during the times they believe oil prices will be firm but they'll refrain from boosting hedging volumes substantially. A plunge in prices, though, will draw them out as they will seek to protect against future rises in prices.\n\nCathay Pacific Airways, which consumed 39.5 million barrels of fuel in 2013, did just that in April 2013 when it took advantage of a brief drop in fuel prices to extend fuel hedging into 2016, the Hong Kong airline disclosed with its earnings in March this year.\n\n\"We are currently about 25 per cent covered for 2014 and the first half of 2015 at Brent prices of more than US$94 to US$95 a barrel, and about 11 per cent for the second half of 2015 and the first half of 2016,\" its spokesman said.\n\n\"Our hedging coverage changes over time and depends on different levels of Brent oil prices,\" he said, adding that the airline's hedging coverage ranges from 10 to 60 per cent for the next 12 months.\n\nSingapore Airlines, Asia's biggest airline by market value, which hedges between 20 and 60 per cent of its fuel requirements, went for the cap of 60 per cent for the second half of its financial year that ended in March at US$118 a barrel of jet fuel prices, a spokesman said. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

It will feature treatment rooms, six outdoor spa pavilions and a spa garden.\n\nBeyond the physical renovations, existing staff at the hotel will be trained to meet Sofitel's standards, Mr Issenberg said.\n\nBobby Hiranandani, managing director of Royal Group, said: \"You are going to see a world of a difference from the service standards, to the way the design of the property will be.\"\n\nRoyal Group bought the property for $210.85 million from Hong Kong-based HKR International.\n\nThe resort will have 215 keys including suites and villas, with renovations handled by DP Architect/DP Green Landscape, and interiors by design house MaxStudio.\n\nApart from the resort on Sentosa, Royal Group owns the Sofitel So Singapore, which is expected to open at the end of May.\n\nLocated along Robinson Road, the hotel, which features a boutique design setting, will cater more to those looking for a city experience.\n\n\"We've got two Sofitels, and probably a couple more to come,\" said Asok Kumar Hiranandani, chairman of Royal Group, adding that the hotels would not necessarily be in Singapore.\n\nThe other hotel brands in Accor's portfolio include Pullman, Mercure, Novotel and Ibis. In Singapore, the company has four hotels, excluding the two upcoming Sofitels.\n\nSingapore has been the company's Asia-Pacific headquarters since 2008. Accor moved its upscale and luxury brands headquarters to Singapore this year because it is experiencing the fastest growth for that market in the region, Mr Issenberg said.\n\nAccor's largest growth markets in the region will be China, followed by Indonesia and India.\n\nMr Issenberg said the company's target, set in 2010, was to have 700 hotels in the region by end-2015. It has around 570 currently.\n\n\"I think we will come close, might be a few less or a few more,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is also a company which is well known for its extremely thorough due-diligence process.\n\nFor example, its approach to selecting the planes for its fleet is more than just the stuff of urban legend in the industry. A CEO of a leading international airline once let on that his team, like many others in the industry, often waits to see what SIA does before making their decision on a plane-type. \"Nobody will spend time and money to reinvent the wheel after SIA has engineered it so precisely.\"\n\nA case in point was the A380, whose popularity took off largely after SIA committed to the giant plane and became the first to fly it some seven years ago. And many in the industry still recall how former SIA CEO Chew Choon Seng's remarks about the original Airbus A350 being too narrow prompted the European planemaker to redesign the plane, which is now known as the A350XWB (extra wide body). SIA promptly placed orders for 20 of these planes, and was quickly followed by others.\n\nSo when it was announced yesterday that SIA would be the title sponsor of the F1 Singapore Grand Prix for two years, starting this September, many observers saw this as keeping in character. As one wit noted, SIA may have been interested in the Singapore GP sponsorship for a while, but it decided to let SingTel bear \"the tuition fees\".\n\nThat might seem somewhat harsh to SingTel, which after all has had a good run with its six-year sponsorship, which some estimate to be worth about $100 million. But there is no denying that SIA is stepping in only after the event has established itself as a well-oiled marquee race in the Formula 1 calendar.\n\nToday, the F1 Singapore GP is one of the most popular events on the F1 calendar, attracting around 260,000 spectators over the three race days, and generating more than $150 million in incremental tourism receipts per race. It is estimated that some 250,000 international visitors came to Singapore for the last six races, with many hailing from non-traditional tourism source markets. And the event attracts almost 100 million television viewers from all over the world every September.\n\nAnd here's the thing. Despite its global investments, SingTel is essentially a Singapore-centric entity. On the other hand, SIA is a Singapore company with a critical global profile.\n\nThus, SIA would have studied the costs and benefits of being associated with this event. It would have assessed the boost to its brand and business from having its name emblazoned in lights across TV screens all over the world. Yes, just like the due diligence it does when it picks its planes and plans its routes, SIA would have done its sums carefully.\n\nThe two-year commitment - which is extendable - to the Singapore F1 dovetails nicely with the airline's strategic objectives, be it boosting its cargo business, re-energising networks, rewarding its priority passengers and other customers, or burnishing its branding or market positioning.\n\nWith the inking of the sponsorship, SIA now joins the ranks of some of its keenest competitors, Etihad, Qatar, GulfAir and Emirates, which spend tens of millions on global sponsorship events that range from football and golf to motorsports and sea sports. Last year, Emirates became a global partner with Formula One, signing a five-year sponsorship deal that pushed the Dubai-based airline's total sports sponsorship for 2013 to around US$272 million.\n\nSIA, with almost $5 billion in the kitty, can afford this Singapore F1 ride. Up to now, the company's involvement in sports sponsorship has been somewhat limited and local. Its SIA Cup derby is popular but draws a rather specific crowd. Its other sports involvements have been modest and fly under the radar.\n\nLike most sponsorships, the SIA-SGP partnership is symbiotic. While the Singapore F1 will benefit from the association with a global brand that SIA has become, the airline will leverage on this iconic sports event to further raise its global profile and presence at a time when the competition - via imitation and innovation - is real and serious.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/high-speeds-high-stakes", "site_title": "High speeds, high stakes", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nHigh speeds, high stakes\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Apr 16, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIN June, the Singapore Exchange (SGX) will enjoy a boost in liquidity as lowered fees and new discounts and rebates entice market makers and high-speed traders to set up shop here.\n\nThat's the plan, at least. But depending on who you ask, high-frequency traders are either harbingers of doom for capital markets or herald a new age of liquidity.\n\nThe truth, as is often the case, is a little more nuanced. High-frequency or algorithmic trading can be good or bad for the market, and the answer pivots on two points.\n\nThe first is whether SGX can properly police the new players it wants to attract. And second, will those players find it worthwhile to continue providing liquidity in this market?\n\nSGX this month revealed that it hoped to sign on eight to 10 market makers and 15 to 20 liquidity providers as the exchange prepares to roll out a number of changes to its securities trading fees regime. Among those changes will be lower clearing fees and discounts or rebates for market makers, who have to provide bid-ask quotes, and liquidity providers, who have to trade a minimum value in specific stocks.\n\nThose moves, which are partly aimed at improving the liquidity of the market, come amid intense global scrutiny of high-frequency trading. In the United States, regulators are poised to investigate some of the practices highlighted in Michael Lewis' critical new book, Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt.\n\nSGX, which has been cautiously inching towards opening its doors to high-frequency traders for more than three years since it contemplated a trading engine upgrade, has sought to ease fears by stressing two points.\n\nFirst, the most popular and controversial practices carried out by high-frequency arbitrageurs in the US cannot happen in Singapore. For a start, inter-exchange front-running is a non-starter because SGX is the only securities market in Singapore. SGX will also impose minimum participation hurdles to ensure that the market makers and liquidity providers are providing quotes and trades over a sufficient amount of time.\n\nSecond, SGX president Muthukrishnan Ramaswami has said that the market operator will not allow order types that can create an unfair playing field.\n\nThe first point is correct, and the second is assuring. Traders and investors should therefore take comfort in the fact that SGX is addressing those issues.\n\nBut the best-designed and most well-intentioned rules and regulations are ultimately meaningless unless the last mile of surveillance and enforcement is covered. The market is especially sensitive to this aspect of regulation amid the ongoing investigations into the penny stock sell-off sparked by the collapse of the shares of Asiasons Capital, Blumont Group and LionGold Corp late last year.\n\nDo SGX and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) have the technical know-how to understand the algorithms and technology powering these new players on the block?\n\nFinancial market players are nothing if not resourceful when it comes to finding ways to make money. While the current framework may address the most egregious practices of high-frequency traders, can the regulators stay ahead of a fast-adapting industry?\n\nThe challenge for the exchange is to allow players to make money by exploiting market inefficiencies and injecting liquidity, but to do so without damaging the integrity of the market or hurting retail players.\n\nThere is a valid argument being made that high-frequency trading is a momentum-driven technique that ignores fundamentals. And supporting such an activity does nobody any good.\n\nThat is only partially true.\n\nFundamentals-driven investing is the philosophical gold standard. But there is a role for arbitrage strategies even if they are purely technical in nature because they do remove inefficiencies from the system. Properly regulated, activities which add liquidity to the system should be good for most investors.\n\nSo can a balance be found? Can we enforce a speed limit yet allow an efficient and speedy highway?\n\nThat is part of the ongoing global debate. But in Singapore the stakes are extremely high. Push too much against the high-frequency players and they will abandon or avoid this market.

They agreed that the first amendments to the ILO's Maritime Labour Convention, 2006, (MLC) will protect abandoned seafarers as well as provide financial security for compensation in cases of death and long-term disability due to occupational injury or hazard.\n\nThe amendments were developed over nearly a decade by a Joint Working Group established by the ILO and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in 1998 and will strengthen the 2006 convention. They establish mandatory requirements that shipowners have financial security to cover abandonment, as well as death or long-term disability of seafarers because of occupational injury and hazard.\n\n\"These legal standards will provide relief and peace of mind to abandoned seafarers and their families wherever they may be,\" said Cleopatra Doumbia-Henry, director of the ILO Labour Standards Department. \"In addition, by adopting these amendments to the convention, shipowners and governments are also strengthening its provisions aimed at ensuring a level playing field for quality shipping around the world.\"\n\nUnder the new provisions, ships will be required to carry certificates or other documents to establish that financial security exists to protect seafarers working on board. Failure to provide this protection may mean that a ship can be detained in a port.\n\nAs at March 2014, the ILO's Abandonment of Seafarers Database listed 159 abandoned merchant ships, some dating back to 2006 and still unresolved.\n\n\"The new measures will guarantee that seafarers are not abandoned, alone and legally adrift for months on end, without pay, adequate food and water and away from home,' Ms Doumbia-Henry said. \"They also clearly make flag states responsible for ensuring that adequate financial security exists to cover the cost of abandonment, and claims for death and long-term disability due to occupational injury and hazards.\"\n\nA further set of amendments was also agreed on, regarding shipowners' liability to ensure financial security is provided, certified and inspected, in order to deal with contractual claims as quickly as possible.\n\nThe MLC came into force on Aug 20, 2013 and so far 57 ILO member states, representing more than 80 per cent of the world's global shipping tonnage, have ratified the convention.\n\nFor the shipowners, International Shipping Federation (ISF) spokesman Arthur Bowring said ISF members were particularly concerned to see the new ILO video on the B Ladybug, where the crew has been without financial or welfare support from the shipowner for well over 12 months.\n\nHe said: \"This is the sort of deplorable situation that the new amendments to the MLC, 2006 will help to speedily address. The MLC 2006 is intended to bring social justice and fair competition to the shipping industry and the lack of a specific reference to abandonment in the mandatory instruments of ILO and IMO was an omission that needed comprehensive action.\"\n\nHe added: \"Shipowners have a responsibility for seafarers under their contractual employment arrangements, and the problems created when the seafarers are abandoned needed specific legislative measures. The new amendments not only provide that safeguard but also recognise the role to be played by flag states and labour supply states.\"\n\nMr Bowring said that while only a \"very tiny proportion\" of the world's seafarers experience the despair of abandonment, \"that does not make the occurrence any less serious for the affected seafarers and their families\".\n\nInternational Transport Workers' Federation president Paddy Crumlin said the vote \"represents a genuine turning point for the convention\". He continued: \"It proves that seafarers, shipowners and governments are committed to continuously reviewing the implementation of the MLC in order to ensure that it is a truly global and living instrument for the protection and benefit of all seafarers. Abandonment is a particularly dark stain on the industry and the new amendments are real and concrete relief for seafarers facing that dire predicament.\"\n\nWhether there will be any speedy relief for the B Ladybug crew remains to be seen. Most probably the only help they will get will be from voluntary organisations that still provide a much-needed safety net for the industry. But the amendments should help prevent such occurrences in the future. Therefore, they should be welcome. We will only know how well the financial guarantee system will work in practice when actual abandonments occur after the amendments come into force.\n\nBut really the situation is morally quite straightforward. On the high seas ships are the territory of the country whose flag they fly, and that country benefits from the registration fees it charges the shipowner.\n\nWhen things go very wrong, is it right for the flag state to just stand back and watch? I don't think so, and that is the case whether or not the MLC explicitly puts a duty on the flag state.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With 2013 proforma sales of US$3.5 billion, the combined entity will have a workforce of around 7,000 globally, about 20,000 channel partners in more than 100 countries and a robust IP (intellectual property) portfolio, with approximately 4,500 US and international patents issued and pending.\n\nLast year, Motorola Enterprise clocked around US$2.5 billion in sales while Zebra came in with US$1 billion. Despite its smaller size, Zebra expects to fund the transaction with about US$200 million of available cash on hand and US$3.25 billion through a new credit facility and the issuance of debt.\n\nTracking devices which can connect to the Internet and send data to computers are at the core of what is known as the Internet of Things (IoT). Market estimates reckon that by 2020 IoT will result in US$14.4 trillion in profits for companies worldwide. Zebra's acquisition of the enterprise division of Motorola Solutions could be the first of many such consolidation moves in an industry which currently is dominated by small specialist companies.\n\nZebra hopes to offer end-to-end building blocks to companies which embark on their IoT journey. These include RFID (radio frequency identification) and barcode sensing and enabled handhelds as well as wearable devices for a mobile workforce.\n\nIt would also offer cloud platforms for IoT management and business analytics capabilities.\n\nRod Rodericks, Zebra's Asia Pacific vice-president and general manager, told The Business Times that the combination of the two businesses significantly enhances\n\nthe relevance of the combined entity's prospects for growth. \"Together, we have a full portfolio of technologies to give customers intelligence on their physical assets, people and transactions across the enterprise to drive winning business decisions.\"\n\nForrester Research senior analyst Clement Teo said the acquisition is a strong signal of the role data analytics will play in the near future. \"The move is great for Zebra as it'll be able to distil data streams to improve its supply chain, production processes and even discover new patterns of usage that could open up potential ways for Zebra's customers to sell products and services.\"\n\nAfter the transaction, Motorola Solutions will retain its iDEN product portfolio that was part of its enterprise business and will continue its government business, including its professional commercial radio product portfolio.\n\nMr Rodericks noted that Zebra has already started the integration planning process. \"Our primary objective is to maintain business continuity and have no disruption to ongoing business. In addition, we are providing transparency to all our employees so they understand what is going on and what to expect.\"\n\nGreg Brown, Motorola Solutions chairman and CEO, said yesterday that the company has undertaken a review of its strategy last year and concluded that the synergies between the company's government and enterprise businesses are not as great as the value it could create by being focused on its core government and public safety business.\n\n\"Going forward, we will have absolute clarity of purpose and mission as we serve customers globally with our suite of mission-critical communications solutions. This business is truly distinctive in its industry leadership, strong pipeline position, long-term track record of consistent profitability and cash flow, and an array of growth opportunities.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The banking and property mogul has helped Ezion secure a higher charter rate for a yet-to-begin liftboat contract, according to Maybank Kim Eng analyst Yeak Chee Keong. And the 71-year old, shrewd billionaire appears on the scene just two months after he and his associates picked up a chunk of Malaysian-listed Scomi Energy Services, a firm which provides drilling services to the oil and gas sector.\n\nMr Quek is reported to also own stakes in Malaysia's Sona Petroleum and TH Heavy Engineering and used to own shares in Malaysian-listed Kencana Petroleum and Perdana Petroleum.\n\nFor Ezion, this has been a mighty busy year. It just snagged two liftboat contracts collectively worth US$78.7 million, bringing the total value of jobs clinched so far this year to US$260.3 million.\n\nCorporate activity has also perked up with Ezion having just snapped up stakes in Catalist-listed JK Tech Holdings and mainboard-member AusGroup, a move lauded by analysts as part of an effort to focus on its core liftboat business and spin off the other businesses into these entities.\n\nThe latest deal heralds the coming together of two wealthy entrepreneurs from both sides of the Causeway.\n\nEzion is majority owned by low-key chief executive Chew Thiam Keng, who made it to the 50th spot of Forbes Singapore's rich roster last year.\n\nThe 42-year old bought into a languishing electrical company in 2007 which has since, under his stewardship, morphed into a thriving player in the service rigs market as Ezion.\n\nMr Quek, a familiar name in Forbes most moneyed list, is Malaysia's fourth richest, whose business flagships are finance and property stalwarts Hong Leong and Guoco groups.\n\nOnce Mr Quek is done with scooping up 100 million new Ezion shares, it will give him a 7.7-per cent interest in the firm, the largest stake second only to Mr Chew's holdings.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The A$2.5 billion (S$2.9 billion) project will be funded mostly by the private sector, he said, with first flights expected in the mid-2020s.\n\nA second airport for Sydney was first proposed over 50 years ago, but became mired in political debate before Mr Abbott promised to build one in last year's victorious election campaign.\n\nHe was voted in on a ticket pledging he would be an \"infrastructure prime minister\", targeting infrastructure projects to revive economic growth that sagged as Australia's mining investment boom faded since 2012.\n\n\"It is essentially going to be an infrastructure package for Western Sydney, a long-overdue infrastructure package for Western Sydney, that does also involve an airport,\" Mr Abbott told reporters in Canberra.\n\nWhile the project is designed to bring a straightforward injection of investment and jobs to the area in the near term, implementing it and making efficient use of the extra capacity it brings in the longer term may be more complex.\n\nSydney's current sole airport is Kingsford Smith, operated by Sydney Airport Holdings Ltd in the Mascot suburb, 10 kilometres southeast of the city centre. Under rules governing its privatisation in 2002, Sydney Airport has the right of first refusal to develop and operate a second airport in the city.\n\n\"Basically it's the first right to develop and operate a second airport, but it's something that would be subject to lengthy discussions,\" Sydney Airport's spokeswoman Laura Stevens told Reuters.\n\nTalks between the government and the airport operator may be complicated by the fact that Sydney Airport already has an existing 20-year plan to upgrade Kingsford Smith. That plan was devised to meet forecast demand of 74 million passengers in 2033, nearly double 2013's 38 million passengers.\n\nThe time frame for consultations will be \"a minimum of a year and a maximum of two years\", Infrastructure Minister Warren Truss told reporters in Canberra. \"If they (Sydney Airport) choose not to do so, then that opportunity will be offered to others.\"\n\nAs airlines like the country's flagship carrier, Qantas Airways Ltd, welcomed the move to increase capacity, analysts said that Sydney Airport would either have to adapt its existing expansion plans or face the consequences of being shut out of a major development that could be suited for low-cost carriers keen to grow.\n\n\"I don't see how they could avoid that (working with the government),\" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. \"They (Sydney Airport) operate under government auspices anyway, and taking an antagonistic or competitive approach, I think would ultimately work against them.\"\n\nThe site at Badgerys Creek may lack the appeal of Kingswood Smith's greater proximity to central Sydney, but Mr McCarthy said that the new airport could be developed to be a hub for budget airlines appealing to customers who prize good deals over convenience of access.\n\nThe likelihood of a less-restrictive curfew on flights in and out of Badgerys Creek would be a further positive for airlines willing to operate in less-convenient hours.\n\n\"On the issue of noise, I don't believe this is going to be anything like the problem at Badgerys that it has been at Mascot,\" Mr Abbott said.\n\nMichael Heffernan, an economist at brokerage firm Lonsec, said a second airport was just what Sydney needs. \"The reason we're getting two airports is because it's basically needed, so I don't think there's any necessarily adverse impact given the fact that we've got 10 years to go and population increases.\"\n\nAccording to the latest statistics available, Sydney's population stood at 4.7 million in June 2012, nearly a third higher than 2006's 3.6 million. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

However, Q1's growth was still slightly higher than analysts' expectations, which suggests that Beijing may ease up on further measures to stimulate the economy.\n\nAnalysts had expected growth of 7.3 per cent in the three months to March, after a string of weaker-than-expected data over the past few weeks pointed to a slowdown throughout the economy.\n\nNonetheless most do not anticipate a hard landing, arguing that slower growth is not necessarily bad and will allow for structural reforms.\n\nOfficials at the statistics bureau attributed the slower first-quarter growth data to weak external demand - affected in part by the severe United States winter - a struggling real estate market and structural changes.\n\n\"The growth slowdown is a reflection of China's growth model transformation,\" National Bureau of Statistics spokesman Sheng Laiyun told reporters. \"China can no longer expect double-digit growth.\"\n\nAnalysts say the economy was also affected by capacity cutbacks in the steel and cement sectors as well as tight monetary conditions.\n\nMany now expect further weakness, with some even suggesting GDP growth could slow to 7.1 per cent by the end of the year.\n\n\"Should the current sequential growth rate stay flat at 1.4 per cent quarter-on-quarter then GDP growth should drop to below 7 per cent in Q2. The March data, especially the continued slowdown in fixed asset investment (FAI) growth and falling housing sales, could mean further downward pressure on growth,\" said Qu Hongbin and Sun Junwei, economists with HSBC.\n\nData published yesterday shows that industrial output rose 8.8 per cent in March from a year earlier, compared with analyst forecasts of a 9 per cent increase.\n\nRetail sales rose 12.2 per cent in March from a year earlier compared with expectations for a rise of 12.1 per cent, while January-to-March fixed asset investment was up 17.6 per cent from a year earlier versus market expectations of an 18.1 per cent rise.\n\nPremier Li Keqiang, by setting a GDP growth target of \"about\" 7.5 per cent last March, anticipated the economy, which grew 7.7 per cent in 2013, still had room to slow some more. Faced with rising local government debts and overcapacity, the government is set on steering the economy from investments towards consumption, which means letting go of double-digit growth rates.\n\nMr Li last week reiterated there would be no major stimulus in the coming months. The government took micro measures to boost investment in targeted sectors of the economy in March, a move interpreted as more of a boost for investors rather than a real injection of funds into the economy.\n\nShould growth rates continue to drop, economists expect more such measures as well as some monetary-policy support such as a reduction in banks' reserve requirement ratios in the second half of the year. The government could also relax housing policies at the local government level to support second-tier property markets.\n\n\"Policymakers seem pretty comfortable with the current pace of growth,\" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist at Capital Economics in Singapore. \"I don't think they're going to announce any further significant measures to support growth.\"\n\nDespite the slower-than- anticipated slowdown, economists said the Chinese economy shows no sign of crashing.\n\n\"Overall, this is a good slowdown. Investment decelerated, due to tight credit conditions and capacity consolidation, while consumption was largely stable. It seems that policymakers share this view, based on their recent talk of no big stimulus,\" said Yao Wei, an economist with Societe Generale.\n\nMarkets closed up on the data.

Its demand for resources also means that the commodities supercycle will continue, Mr Smirk believes.\n\nGiving his view on the debate that many are still divided over, he said the supercycle is not over, but is maturing and establishing a new equilibrium between demand and supply.\n\nOn gold, which has defied bearish forecasts to climb 9 per cent so far this year to US$1,310 an ounce, Mr Smirk foresees it recording another year of decline.\n\nGold is expected to reach US$1,025 an ounce at the end of this year in his forecast, though it will climb higher from early next year.\n\n\"We don't have a high inflationary environment, and liquidity is still going to unwind,\" he said. \"I think gold is going to underperform (other commodities).\"\n\nMr Smirk, who is based in Sydney and has been with Westpac since 1999, is the second most accurate bullion forecaster over the past two years, according to Bloomberg.\n\nGold prices will progressively increase to reach US$1,170 an ounce in September next year in his view. \"We see commodities coming through in 2015, and gold following that,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's not a sustainable strategy, more so for a long-term diversified investment company,\" said a seasoned banker.\n\n1MDB, which was set up in 2009 and chaired by Prime Minister Najib Razak, had acquired valuable land in the heart of Malaysia's Kuala Lumpur city centre from the government to build the Tun Razak Exchange (TRX) - a new financial district - and an iconic mixed-development project to attract tourist and foreign investor dollars.\n\nWhile detractors have described the purchases as \"sweetheart deals\" as the actual value of the prime land is far higher than what the fund had coughed up for it, 1MDB's backers say that the deals were done at arm's length.\n\nIn addition, the fund has come under fire for overpaying for the power assets. 1MDB forked out RM10.85 billion for these, mostly old plants nearing the end of their concessions.\n\nThe latest accounts which reveal an impairment loss on goodwill back up the view that 1MDB could indeed have overpaid for these power assets.\n\nThe latest 2013 accounts were audited by Deloitte and signed off at the end of March - the extended deadline for 1MDB to file its returns after they were delayed for several months.\n\nThe fund has since added a few more energy contracts under its belt which could sweeten the mega initial public offering (IPO) of its energy arm, IMDB Energy, slated for later this year.\n\n1MDB clinched a sizeable 2,000 MW, coal-fired power plant project in February, which it has tied up with Japan's Mitsui to undertake. More recently, it secured another contract to build a 50 MW solar plant, Malaysia's biggest non-hydro renewable energy plant.\n\n\"Collectively, these new jobs bring the right mix of assets to the table for a new listing,\" said a banker.\n\nIf the IPO - expected to raise at least US$2 billion - pans out this year, it could significantly swing the needle for Malaysia's IPO activity. It will also be one of South-east Asia's largest new listing for the year.\n\nFor 1MDB, which has some RM11.7 billion in current liabilities, a stalled IPO could carry with it other woes, chiefly in the form of debt repayment headaches.\n\nLooming on the horizon is a RM6.2 billion bridge loan provided by Malaysia's largest and fourth-largest lenders Maybank and RHB Bank, respectively. The repayment deadline has already been extended and now falls due next month.\n\nThe loans were provided to IMDB Energy to part fund the acquisition of the power assets.\n\nMarket observers say that the fund's growing debt obligations are causing some unease in the country's banking circles as well as regulator Bank Negara Malaysia.\n\n\"This is potentially a big risk and it's in everyone's interest to monitor the situation closely,\" said an insider.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth/wealth-investing/managing-spending-during-retirement", "site_title": "Managing spending during retirement", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nManaging spending during retirement\n\nThe key to a successful retirement plan is controlling expenses\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Apr 15, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nADVISERS put a considerable amount of effort into talking to clients about accumulating their life savings. But advisers and their clients tend to devote less thought as to how to spend that money when it's time. Some sort of conversation generally happens when clients approach retirement, but it may need to start happening earlier and become much more sophisticated.\n\n\"If I have US$1 million in my retirement account, how I'm going to distribute it is No 9 out of a total of 10 steps,\" said David A Littell, director of the retirement income certified professional programme at the American College of Financial Services.\n\nMr Littell has actually drawn up a list of 18 risks that people have to consider. These include some you can control - spending too much - and some you can't, such as living longer than expected, needing expensive health care and not being able to work as long before or in retirement as planned.\n\nAdditionally, there is a wave of young and wealthy people - like the beneficiaries of social media companies now selling for millions - who face a similar question. Will the several million dollars they made for being at the right company at the right time last?\n\n\"The biggest problem I see is that people have a hard time connecting a pool of money that they can't understand to a time period they can't quantify,\" said Peter J Rekstad, chief executive of BGM TruNorth Wealth Partners. There are two basic ways to calculate what people can spend, although both are less helpful in practice than in theory. There is the linear calculation, based on a set percentage of the principal taken each year. This is commonly expressed as the 4 per cent rule, although recent research has reduced that number to 3.5 or 3 per cent. It is simple but fraught with risks.\n\nOn the investment return side, it requires people to be lucky and stop working just before their investments are set to rise. If they stop working and their investments fall, they are subject to what is called \"sequence of returns risk\". It means their annual draw is going to be lower if their account value falls.\n\n\"The systematic withdrawal strategy can be inefficient in some environments and dangerous in others,\" said Aaron Thiel, senior wealth planner at PNC Wealth Management. On the spending side, that strategy fails to account for how people spend when they stop working: Freed of the need to go to an office every day, most splurge in the early years of retirement and cut back later. \"I describe the stages of retirement as go-go, slow-go and no-go,\" Mr Rekstad said. That can be a problem for someone who cashes out young. \"The 50-year-old has a much longer go-go period than someone who retires at 68,\" he said. A more advanced method is probability analysis. Advisers often present this strategy to clients by talking about Monte Carlo simulations that test thousands of probable outcomes to come up with the likelihood that a strategy will succeed.\n\nIt is effective but can be difficult for people to understand. Of the many other ways to help people manage their spending when income is not coming in, two in particular try to nudge people into the right behaviour: the time-segmented approach and the use of funded ratios.\n\nThe first works by getting people to think of money lasting for certain time periods: the first 10 years, the next 10 and so on. Mr Thiel says he advises clients to set up a series of accounts that will be liquidated over that period and replaced by the next account. \"A structure like this creates a long-term focus,\" he said. \"It matches assets with current and future liabilities.\" Yet it still requires people to stay on a budget for those years and not spend beyond what the account has in it.\n\nA newer and more dynamic approach is to borrow the concept of funded ratios from the pension fund world. This number is a measurement of the assets in a pension fund versus the payments it will eventually have to make. The closer to 100 per cent it is for a pension, the better.\n\nTimothy Noonan, managing director of capital markets insights at Russell Investments, said using funded ratios with individuals would help take the focus off returns and account balances and put it on how long a person expects to live with the money he has.\n\nThe funded ratio is calculated by doing a present-value calculation of the amount of money someone has saved or will receive - say, from Social Security or a pension - and comparing it with basic and desired expenses and life expectancy. Since it gets represented as a percentage, it gives advisers and clients a way to check how they're doing.\n\n\"When you consider, what percentage of my portfolio is safe to distribute, most people believe mistakenly that it must be related to the amount of my wealth,\" Mr Noonan said. \"But in fact it's related to the length of my life.\" In his book, Someday Rich: Planning for Sustainable Tomorrows Today (Wiley Finance, 2012), Mr Noonan gives the example of a couple trying to calculate their annual spending, having saved US$775,000 by their early 60s and counting on $38,000 a year from Social Security. They're debating between needing US$60,000 a year and US$72,000 a year (including Social Security) for their expected life expectancies.\n\nWith the former, they're 152 per cent funded; with the latter, that number drops to 98 per cent. In his own situation, Mr Noonan, 50, said he was 95 per cent funded if he retired today. In two years, with his earnings and savings continuing, that number rises to 114 per cent. Two more years and it hits 125 per cent. Ideally, he said, people should aim to get to 135 per cent funded, which would insulate them from most shocks.\n\nBut it is still an art, not a science, since people don't know how long they're going to live. To compensate for living longer than expected, Mr Noonan said people needed to continually assess their funded ratio. If it goes too low, and it looks as if they're going to run out of money, the funded ratio would dip below 100 per cent. At that point, people have a choice: reduce spending to get the ratio back up or buy an income annuity to cover basic expenses. Russ Hill, chief executive of Halbert Hargrove, a wealth advisory firm based in Long Beach, California, said using a funded ratio had been effective in high-cost areas where having millions of dollars does not guarantee a comfortable retirement and with young people who have experienced a windfall. \"The reason this is a useful tool is that it reflects the fact that there are no formulas that allow you to say, 'If you use this formula, you'll always be okay,'\" Mr Hill said. \"It's an iterative process. You have to review things. The funded status allows you to deconstruct the elements.\"\n\nAnd it allows for people to know when they have made a mistake. Mr Hill said he had a client in San Diego who sold a lot of technology stock and appeared to have enough money at 50 to not work again. But because the client couldn't stick to a budget, the funded ratio kept dropping, despite his best counsel.\n\n\"The final result was they sold the house in San Diego, moved to Oregon and fired us,\" he said. \"That was a lifestyle change. They had to downsize.\" While you generally can't control how long you live, you can control your spending.

They have therefore decided to consolidate their shareholdings in HPL so as to be in a position to cooperate and implement their shared objectives for HPL and to enhance value over time.\"\n\nYesterday's announcement said 68 Holdings has agreed to acquire 41.91 per cent of HPL, comprising 213.98 million shares at $3.50 each. Of this, 18.44 per cent is from Mr Ong and two companies controlled by him, Reef Holdings and Como Holdings, and 20.16 per cent from Nassim Developments. The remainder is from Mr Ong's wife, Christina; and David Ban and his wife, Pat.\n\nThe offer vehicle is 60 per cent owned by Cuscaden Partners Pte Ltd and 40 per cent by Nassim Developments. Cuscaden, in turn, is 90 per cent owned by Mr Ong. Mr Ban owns the rest. Nassim Developments is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Wheelock Properties (Singapore).\n\nMr Ong, who is managing director of HPL, had set up HPL with his late father-in-law, Peter Fu Yun Siak. Mrs Ong and her three sibilings Peter Fu Chong Cheng, David Fu Kuo Chen and Juanita Fu Su Ying have a deemed interest of about 21.7 per cent in HPL. Mr Peter Fu Chong Cheng has an additional stake of about 7.1 per cent deemed interest, taking his total stake to nearly 29 per cent.\n\nInterestingly, apart from Mrs Ong, yesterday's announcement did not indicate whether 68 has received an undertaking from the Fus to accept the offer.\n\nThe offer will be conditional on the consortium securing more than 50 per cent of the company.\n\nYesterday, Wheelock was up 7 cents at $1.815. HPL rose to $3.53 from $3.13 last Friday. Trading was halted on Monday. Some 2.96 million shares changed hands. Although this is a sharp increase from last Friday's 77,000 shares, they represent just 0.6 per cent of the issued shares.\n\nMarket watchers said this could be a sign shareholders are waiting for the independent financial adviser's view. Or perhaps they believe a counter-offer could be made - from the Fu family that owns nearly 29 per cent of HPL. A clearer picture could emerge in the days and weeks ahead.\n\n68 Holdings intends to retain HPL's listing; however, if the free float falls below 10 per cent, it will reassess its options.\n\nGaining majority control would make it easier for the consortium to realise HPL's potential. The announcement immediately revived talk of HPL eyeing redevelopment of its adjoining assets in Orchard Road - the Hilton and Four Seasons hotels, Forum the Shopping Mall and HPL House. There was previously even speculation that HPL could persuade the authorities to sell to it the Angullia public carpark next door for a bigger redevelopment. Wheelock Place, an office and retail property, is separated from HPL's assets by the Angullia carpark.\n\nSince Wheelock bought a stake in HPL in 2006, speculation has been rife that Wheelock could partner HPL to redevelop HPL's Orchard Road assets.\n\nWheelock estimates the gain on disposal of its HPL shares at $40.15 million. Its total cost of the shares is understood to be about $1.86 per share.\n\nCuscaden Partners and Nassim Developments each has the right to require 68 Holdings to effect a pro-rata in-specie distribution of all its assets to its shareholders on or after the fifth anniversary of the close of offer. If a deadlock occurs, each of them will have the right to require 68 Holdings to effect a distribution in-specie of all its assets to its shareholders on a pro-rata basis.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But they also reckon that minority shareholders who have bought CMA shares since its IPO launch in November 2009 at $2.12 apiece may feel that the offer price could have been sweeter.\n\n\"A delisting would be positive for CapitaLand but the offer price may be insufficient for CMA's minority shareholders to bite,\" said Maybank analyst Wilson Liew.\n\nYet, this could be \"one of CapitaLand's most astute acquisitions\" as it will allow CapitaLand to leverage on CMA's retail expertise while keeping it as a key earnings driver. This will also make it more synergistic for the group to pursue integrated projects that are similar to its suite of Raffles City projects, Mr Liew added.\n\nNRA Capital associate director Jacky Lee noted that \"IPO investors may want to reject the offer if they are still holding onto the shares\", given the small offer premium to CMA's $2.12 IPO price and the one to 2 per cent dividend yield per year.\n\nCMA, which also has a secondary listing in Hong Kong, owns 105 shopping malls valued at $34.3 billion as of Dec 31.\n\nWhile shopping mall operators are increasingly challenged by the booming e-commerce industry in China, CapitaLand's malls are still seeing growth, CapitaLand group CEO Lim Ming Yan told reporters on Monday. He explained that with both CapitaLand and CMA currently listed, there are corporate governance issues to consider when they jointly undertake integrated projects, making it a lot slower to respond to the market, he said.\n\nMost analysts see the delisting offer for CMA as a positive redeployment of cash by CapitaLand, after netting $35.7 million from the sale of its 39.1-per cent stake in AustraLand.\n\nCIMB analyst Donald Chua noted that the biggest benefit to CapitaLand's shares is the potential removal of \"the holding company discount\" since CMA's IPO in 2009. \"Taking CMA private when its operational income is on a rise looks timely too,\" he added.\n\nMacquarie Research analysts Soong Tuck Yin and Brandon Lee are also expecting the discount to RNAV for CapitaLand shares to narrow, given the group is much more simplified without two major listed entities AustraLand and CMA. \"We believe CapitaLand's offer to privatise CMA is fair, given it's only at about an 8 per cent discount to our sum-of-parts valuation of CMA at $2.41,\" they said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/local-market-languishes-privatisations", "site_title": "Local market languishes with privatisations", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nLocal market languishes with privatisations\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Apr 15, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT is only April, but with the privatisation of CapitaMalls Asia, Singapore Land and a cash offer for Hotel Properties Limited, the Singapore market is losing some major property plays. Furthermore, a slew of other solid companies, especially in the exciting food and beverage sector, have also been delisted in recent years. Tiger beer maker Asia Pacific Breweries went to Dutch brewer Heineken. Brand's Chicken Essence maker Cerebos Pacific went to Japanese firm Suntory Holdings. Instant coffee maker Viz Branz was taken private. Even homegrown bar chain Harry's Holdings went to a private equity fund less than two years after being listed on Catalist.\n\nOther venerable companies such as WBL Corporation and Guthrie GTS are also gone. WBL, a conglomerate known as Wearnes, was taken over by United Engineers. Guthrie GTS, a property and engineering group which partly owns Jurong Point mall, was taken private by its Indonesian owners. In the commodities space, Olam International is being taken over by a unit of Temasek Holdings. Coal miner Sakari Resources went to Thailand's state-owned energy giant PTT. Others such as sticker printer Adampak and heavy machinery distributor Kian Ann Engineering have also been delisted. The question may very well be asked: what companies are being brought in to replace them, and will they provide long-term value for shareholders? If there are no new ideas, the local market will continue to languish.\n\nThe latest offer by property giant CapitaLand to take subsidiary CapitaMalls Asia private is not necessarily bad news, for investors can still invest in CapitaLand itself. The company, like others in the beaten-down property sector, is trading at a 30-40 per cent discount to its revised net asset value as estimated by analysts. Still, the rash of privatisation is telling. It's happening because of mediocre valuations and a lack of investor interest.\n\nMany investment houses are keeping neutral or underweight allocations on the country. The Singapore market has been flat with securities daily average traded value (SDAV) at around $1-1.5 billion, compared with more than $2 billion before the financial crisis. Retail investors prefer to buy property assets. International investors have moved on to markets such as the United States, Japan and Europe, or within emerging Asia - Hong Kong, China, Indonesia and India.\n\nIn this climate, privatisations will take place as international players and business owners snap up assets at reasonable prices. Minority shareholders get compensated via a premium. But without good companies to replace them, Singapore loses out. As property veteran Han Cheng Fong noted in a recent forum letter, there is a sense of loss when iconic Singaporean brands and businesses are sold into foreign hands. While Singapore is becoming a destination for real estate investment trusts and business trusts, investors usually hold on to them for their yields over the long term. For now, at least shipping and offshore companies are getting decent valuations and coming on board. There needs to be more, in sectors such as healthcare and tourism, if the market is to shine again.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Revenue rose 2.4 per cent to $20.7 million.\n\nQian Hu was hit by an oversupply of the mass market variety of the auspicious dragon fish in 2012. Since the first half of 2013, prices have stabilised, the company noted. It managed to sell more dragon fish since the second half of 2013 mainly to North-east Asia, especially China.\n\nQian Hu's profit improvement was driven by a 151 per cent increase in operating profit for its fish segment to $304,000. The stabilisation of dragon fish prices yielded strong margins. Its accessories segment, which sells aquarium and pet accessories, recorded a steady 5 per cent growth in operating profit to $438,000.\n\nOperating profit fell 43 per cent to $133,000 for its plastics segment which sells plastic bags to pack fish in.

This has generated around $150 million in incremental tourism receipts per year on average. Meanwhile, SIA has access to a client base of premium travellers, which undoubtedly would prove useful to SGP.\n\nLast year, some 87,500 three-day passes were sold in total to both locals and tourists, who hailed from 116 countries. Typically, visitors come from countries such as Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan and China. However, SGP executive director Michael Roche is keen to develop other non-typical source markets such as India, where SIA is planning to launch a full-service airline this year together with Tata.\n\nWhile the airline declined to comment on the price-tag that will come with being the headline sponsor, it is said to be close to what SingTel forked out during its six-year run as title sponsor. Official figures were never disclosed, but it is believed that the telco paid in the region of $10 million-$15 million per year.\n\n\"It worked very, very well for (SingTel) but in any sponsorship, to try and hold them for a lifetime isn't really a realistic thing,\" reasoned Mr Roche, in response to a question on why SingTel decided to bow out. \"I think SIA can expand it more because they are a global brand whereas SingTel had many diffusion brands that weren't under the SingTel brand - they couldn't take it further. We will still work with SingTel on a local basis to market and get to the Singaporean heartlands.\" In response to queries from BT, SingTel's country chief officer (Singapore), Allen Lew, said: \"We are delighted to have had the opportunity to showcase Singapore to the world, strengthening SingTel as a global brand and bringing the Formula One closer to Singaporeans with our activities, heartland roadshows and SingTel Grid Girls. We are pleased to see that another flagship Singapore brand will be taking over the reins.\"\n\nThe Singapore Grand Prix is now in its seventh year (Sept 19-21) after the nation inked another five-year deal in 2012 to host the race till 2017.\n\nEarlier editions of the race have typically cost some $150 million annually, with SGP - backed by hotel tycoon Ong Beng Seng - putting up 40 per cent and the government, the rest. However, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office S Iswaran had said in 2012 that the cost of hosting subsequent races could come down by about 15-20 per cent. At the time, he pointed out that cost-savings would come from various sources - not just franchise fees, but also operational efficiencies and alternative revenue streams.\n\nShares in SIA closed at $10.45 yesterday, up eight cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

While growth is likely to plateau mid-year at sub-trend levels, we see few domestic policy headwinds, although US Federal Reserve tapering is likely to drive further currency weakness. Other key themes include an export recovery and Debtopia (a credit cycle de-rating in South Asia) which keeps us more focused on North versus South Asia, and cyclicals versus defensives.\n\nAsia's equity markets have been under pressure for some years, largely due to the debt overhang and the rising cost of credit. However, in our view, it is earnings growth that will continue to be key to whether Asian equities rise this year. We see some positives. Based on the 2013 year-end reporting season results, earnings increased in 2013 unlike in the previous year. Importantly, the winds are also set to be fair for this year.\n\nConsensus forecasts among analysts are for 15 per cent earnings growth in Asia ex-Japan in 2014 for non-financials. Korea, China, India and Hong Kong account for more than four-fifths of this growth. While a 15 per cent growth is higher than what has been achieved in the last few years in the region, it is in line with the average since 2002.\n\nValuations in Asia ex-Japan are below longer-term averages, but we see limited scope for re-rating next year. In Japan, we think the big re-rating is behind us, but at similar multiples to MSCI World (with better earnings prospects) we do not expect any significant de-rating. With little change in valuations, earnings have the potential to be the key driver in 2014. Earnings forecasts for Asia ex (13 per cent), and Japan (20 per cent) look sensible if margins come through as forecast. Earnings in Japan have even more scope to outperform.\n\nNonetheless, investors absent from the markets over the past two to three years but now seeking to benefit from the return potential in the equity markets should exercise caution. A few critical factors determine success. Investors should define an investment strategy that fits them, apply a methodical analysis of opportunities and risks, and remain disciplined by investing in a well-diversified portfolio that consistently follows the selected investment strategy.\n\n\"Buy and hold\" is no longer a guarantor of investment performance, and what yesterday generated a good return could be a risk tomorrow. More than ever, an investment process that closely follows global market movements, quickly formulates an opinion and swiftly transfers this opinion to the portfolio is essential.\n\nAlthough we doubt that Asian markets in their own right are a likely source of a substantial global economic downturn in 2014, of course, a full-blown crisis has the potential to undermine our positive forecasts for the region.\n\nIndeed, typically, \"wild cards\" are not prompted by monetary policy shifts but, in many cases, by elections or other political factors. The most significant in the Asia-Pacific might hinge on the actual outcomes from the Third Plenum in China. China has de-rated in recent years to nine times forward PE - a 20 per cent discount to the region.\n\nWe think the Plenum reforms are likely to prompt China to re-rate and so outperform Asia ex-Japan at least for the next few months. By the same token, the opening of the capital account could also lead to a spike in interest rates and significant capital outflows and liquidity.\n\nOf course, implementation remains key. If the Chinese authorities keep up the reform momentum by announcing specific measures on top of the broad reforms outlined, we believe the market is likely to continue to re-rate.\n\nCustomised asset allocation is effective only if it is not undermined by emotional and short-term behaviour. To thrive, investors should adhere to a defined strategy by means of regular rebalancing, unless return targets and risk tolerance have fundamentally changed.\n\nSemi-professional judgment and hopes of short-term profits must not be allowed to lead to the aimless and ineffective shuffling of investments. This tends to result in pro-cyclical buying at the highest price and selling at the lowest price, with risk tolerance not infrequently being over-stretched.\n\nDiscipline is key to success but it is turbo-charged when supported by in-depth local knowledge. In our view, Asia ex-Japan continues to trade below its long-term averages on both price-to-book and forward price-to-earnings. Consensus expectation of 13 per cent year-on-year growth in earnings per share for next year looks very reasonable, and both the underlying revenue and margin forecasts appear to have some upside.\n\nThe writer is UBS chief executive officer for wealth management\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": []}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/trading-halts-better-procedures-needed", "site_title": "Trading halts: better procedures needed", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nTrading halts: better procedures needed\n\nPublished\n\nMon, Apr 14, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTRADING halts are one of the most common occurrences in daily market life and are mandatory when listed companies make material announcements such as mergers, rights issues or placements. Yet despite their significance, it is surprising to see that the rules as they stand today are not at all clear and leave plenty of room for uncertainty and, possibly, even opportunity for unfair profit. It is time the Singapore Exchange (SGX) addressed this.\n\nFirst, according to the exchange's Practice Note 13.1 \"Procedures for Trading Halt and Suspension\", companies can call for a halt at any time and must give the market at least 30 minutes to absorb the information before trading resumes.\n\nNote that there is no specified time between halt and announcement, but this is fair enough - business negotiations sometimes drag on longer than expected and companies cannot be expected to give an exact time as to when the news is to be issued.\n\nHowever, although half an hour after issue is probably just about enough time for the public to study complex announcements, it assumes that everyone has kept their eye constantly on the company announcements page on SGX's website from the time the halt was announced.\n\nIf trading resumes, say, 31 minutes after an announcement is released, then someone who is lucky enough to read a material announcement just after it is posted would have a huge advantage over someone who notices it after 30 minutes.\n\nTo ensure everyone has an equal chance to digest the information at the same time, SGX should introduce an alert or prompt on its website's home page and on dealing screens when releases are despatched after a halt. This may still not afford everyone equal time and opportunity to figure out the implications of the announcements as some investors could miss it if they are not watching the home page, but it would go some way towards levelling an uneven playing field.\n\nSecond, with regard to the lifting of the halt, the field is even more lopsided because there are no guidelines other than the one that trading has to resume at the quarter-hour mark, eg, 9am, 9.15am, 9.30am and so on. Note that in an eight-hour trading day, this results in a possible 32 points between 9am and 5pm when trading halts can be lifted - arguably too many. More on this later.\n\nSince trading halts are lifted at the request of companies with no minimum time period required between the time the request is issued and the time trading actually resumes, it is possible for companies to request that trading be resumed only a few minutes after the request (this is actually the case; the shortest time we found is an absurd 28 seconds).\n\nThose privy to the request or who see it first would then hold a big advantage over those who have to constantly check SGX's website for when the halt might be lifted.\n\nA hypothetical example would better illustrate the flaws in the current arrangements. It is in theory possible for a company to call for a halt at, say, 9.30am on a Monday, issue a material announcement on Wednesday at 10.44am, then file a request at 11.14am that same day for trading to restart just one minute later at 11.15am. Since trading resumed at the quarter-hour mark and since the market had at least 30 minutes to study the release, all requirements have been met.\n\nThe potential for unfair advantage should be obvious. Since the announcement was made two days later, many traders might not have been monitoring the exchange's announcements page and would be at a disadvantage to those who knew of its release or saw it first.\n\nThe same applies to the request to lift the halt since a) nobody other than companies themselves would have any idea when this might be, and b) only allowing a minute's - or a few minutes' - reaction time is not really good form, is it?\n\nAs it stands, the entire procedure is cumbersome and shrouded in uncertainty. Apart from the prompt/alert suggestion earlier, the first step in reducing uncertainty would be to require companies to state when trading will resume at the time when the announcements are made.\n\nThis would immediately reduce the number of company releases from three (request for halt, announcement, request for lifting of halt) to two (request for halt, announcement that incorporates lifting of halt), resulting in a more streamlined and transparent system.\n\nIt would then be worth considering replacing the 32 possible resumption of trading points with just two - either 9am or 2pm. This way the market knows that if a halt has not been lifted at 9am, it simply has to watch for a lifting at 2pm. The ultimate goal has to be to give everyone an equal opportunity to trade on significant information, which does not seem to be the case now.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They might be in healthcare, tourism, insurance and the environment, said Peter Sartori, head of Asian equity at fund manager Nikko AM.\n\n\"Asia is evolving, Asia is changing. This has major implications on how we should invest,\" he said at a media briefing yesterday.\n\nIn 1998, for example, real estate companies took up 20.1 per cent of the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index, while technology stocks took up just 6.4 per cent. Last year, the roles were reversed. Real estate companies constituted just 6.6 per cent of the index and technology stocks 20.2 per cent.\n\nForward-thinking investors in 1998 who realised that Asia was more than real estate and positioned themselves in emerging technology companies like South Korea's Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, and Infosys in India would have done extremely well, he said.\n\nNikko AM manages US$160 billion in assets. Mr Sartori co-founded Asia-Pacific investment manager Treasury Asia Asset Management in 2005. The outfit was acquired by Nikko AM last year.\n\nFour sectoral themes his team has highlighted for investors are healthcare, tourism, insurance and the environment.\n\nThe healthcare sector will be driven by an ageing population in Asia, especially in China and South Korea. Urbanisation will also help demand for health services. As people move to cities and get richer, they will want better access to doctors and hospitals, Mr Sartori said.\n\nMedical tourism into Asia will also drive demand. Five of the top 10 global medical tourism locations are in Asia, Mr Sartori said. \"Common medical procedures like knee and hip replacements cost about a quarter of what they would cost in the US. So people make the effort to fly to Asia,\" he said.\n\n\"Healthcare is not dependent on economic growth and is almost recession proof. We really like that,\" he added.\n\nA lot of healthcare stocks in Asia ex-Japan are small and medium-cap stocks. \"We want to identify these early, hopefully they will stay in our portfolio for the next five to 10 years,\" he said.\n\nTourism, meanwhile, is another steady growth story. Inbound tourist arrivals have grown steadily through the years despite the global financial crisis. Asia-Pacific accounted for 28 per cent of the world's inbound tourists in 2011. In 2013, there were 97 million outbound Chinese tourists, having doubled from four years ago and expected to double four years from now.\n\n\"You see them in Singapore's casinos, shopping at Orchard Road, in Sydney, London. Outbound Chinese tourism is a once-in-a-lifetime change in the landscape of tourism industry,\" he said.\n\nFor insurance in Asia, there is a wide disparity in coverage. The Philippines, Russia, Turkey, Indonesia and China are among the lowest in terms of people covered. \"It is reasonable to expect penetration rates to be closer to developed markets,\" Mr Sartori said.\n\nFinally, on the environment, the Chinese government is realising that it cannot be ignored for economic growth. An emerging middle class wants a better quality of life, he said.\n\nNikko AM overweights healthcare stocks like hospitals, medical equipment and pharmaceutical companies. It also has positions on insurance companies, environmental stocks and discretionary consumer stocks. The positions have been in place in the last one to two years and have contributed to performance, Mr Sartori said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is estimated that it will take the AUV anywhere from six weeks to two months to scan the entire search area,\" said JG Daniel Marciniak, a spokesman for the US Seventh Fleet.\n\nFrom its aborted first mission, the Bluefin-21 produced six hours of data which authorities analysed to find no objects of interest, Lt Marciniak added. The drone was expected to embark on its second search mission yesterday.\n\nThe robot, which takes two hours to descend and another two to return to the surface, as well as several hours to download data, will build up a detailed acoustic image of the area using sophisticated \"sidescan\" sonar. It hopes to repeat its success in finding a F-15 fighter jet which crashed off Japan last year.\n\nIt is capable of spending up to 16 hours scouring the sea floor. If it detects possible wreckage, it will be sent back to photograph it in underwater conditions with extremely low light.\n\nOfficials are focusing their acoustic search on an area equivalent to a medium-sized city - 600 sq km. But the much broader search area off the Australian coast covers about 60,000 sq km, according to the government.\n\nThe deep sea area now being searched, the Zenith Plateau, has never been mapped in detail because it is not in any country's economic zone.\n\nHowever, the sea floor is likely covered in \"foraminiferal ooze\", a sludge formed by microscopic marine organisms, which would show up any large metallic object clearly, James Cook University marine geologist Robin Beaman told Reuters.\n\n\"A sidescan is very good at detecting the difference in the acoustic return of a hard object versus a soft, muddy sea floor,\" he said. \"This is quite a good environment for looking for wreck debris, albeit deep.\"\n\nThe Bluefin's main challenge was to remain within 50 metres of the seabed to ensure the best quality sidescan detection without exceeding its 4.5 km depth limit which could risk damaging it, Mr Beaman said.\n\nMalaysian authorities have still not ruled out mechanical problems as causing the plane's disappearance, but say that evidence suggests it was deliberately diverted from its scheduled route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.\n\nAn aircraft's black box records data from the cockpit and conversations among flight crew and may provide answers about what happened to the missing plane. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

It appreciated over October and November last year, as major currencies declined amid a fiscal impasse in the United States and expectations of further quantitative easing in Japan.\n\n\"However, it weakened following the announcement that the US Federal Reserve would begin to taper its asset purchase program. Geo-political events and the slowdown in China's growth also added to the downward pressure on the S$NEER,\" MAS said.\n\nIt added that more recently, the exchange rate has strengthened slightly.\n\nHSBC head of Asian Currency Research Paul Mackel said that his estimates suggest that the central bank was selling US dollars through most of 2013 and continued to do so in 2014, even though the S$NEER was trading above the middle of the policy band this past year.\n\n\"This hints at a shift in stance whereby the MAS has a preference for a slightly stronger, rather than a slightly weaker currency within the band,\" he said.\n\nHSBC thinks that with MAS' steady exchange rate policy more hawkish than others in the region and its strong external balances, the Singapore dollar should outperform the other Asean currencies.\n\nDespite the challenges of a stronger US dollar emerging with the Fed's ongoing tapering, Mr Mackel believes that Singapore dollar will be one of the better placed currencies. \"After all, Singapore's net international investment position shows the economy as a strong net creditor. And the majority of Singapore's net liabilities are in the form of foreign direct investment, which is traditionally sticky. In contrast, the nation holds significant amount of net portfolio assets, which could be repatriated when risk appetite softens,\" Mr Mackel said.\n\nYesterday, after the MAS decided to leave the slope, width and level of the S$NEER policy band unchanged, the Singapore dollar eased against the US dollar to S$1.2521 at 9pm last night.\n\n\"The speculative community had turned short USD-SGD ahead of the announcement, and appears to be using the decision as an opportunity to exit these positions,\" Standard Chartered analysts said.\n\nMaybank expects that the Singapore dollar could weaken to S$1.275 versus the US dollar by the end of Q2, before closing the year at $1.258.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Only two new projects were launched in March: The Santorini in Tampines and Ascent@456 at Balestier Road - 724 units in all.\n\nThis brings the total launch volume in Q1 2014 to 1,964 units - \"the lowest quarterly launch and sales volume since Q4 2008 and Q4 2009 during the global financial crisis\", said Colliers International's director of research and advisory Chia Siew Chuin.\n\nPropNex chief executive Mohamed Ismail said: \"The tight supply situation is a result of developers adopting a deliberate stance to time their launches and possibly adjust their pricing strategy appropriately before putting their product on the market.\"\n\nJones Lang LaSalle national director Ong Teck Hui added that it can be \"daunting\" to launch new projects in the current difficult market, since new sales launches after the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) framework was imposed have not performed well.\n\n\"Of all the new projects launched after TDSR was implemented, only about a quarter achieved a good take-up of 70 per cent and above, but in subsequent months, most of these projects still struggle to sell their units.\"\n\nThis feeds back into the cycle. \"The unsold units in projects previously launched also act as a deterrent for new launches as it only intensifies the competition amongst projects for a limited pool of buyers,\" he added.\n\nAlthough The Santorini sold only 76, or 13 per cent, of its 597 units in March, it became the top-selling project. Median prices for its sold units average $1,100 per sq ft.\n\nAmid the bleak data, some consultants saw a silver lining in the rest of central region (RCR) and core central region (CCR). Colliers' Ms Chia noted that sales in the city fringes and city area improved 44.3 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively in March - due to homebuyers picking up units from earlier launched projects.\n\nIn the RCR, Eight Riversuites sold 44 units, Guillemard Suites 14 units, and Bartley Ridge 12 units; in the CCR, Hallmark Residences sold 13 units, Liv on Wilkie nine units and Goodwood Residences eight units.\n\nHead of CBRE Research, Singapore, Desmond Sim, said \"realistic pricing\" has helped to move more units in the CCR, where there may be \"probable renewed interest\".\n\n\"This is where we noticed that a large proportion of CCR units have moved, with 150 units sold over a launch of 42 units (in Q1),\" he said. Prices for these units have come down slightly from their original launch prices, but one - Hallmark Residences - saw the steepest discount of about 15 per cent on its launch prices.\n\nAnalysts are expecting buying activity to improve in April, with sales volume likely to climb to 500 to 800 units, going by healthy interest in new projects Commonwealth Towers and Lakeville in Jurong.\n\nOther projects in the pipeline include The Crest and Highline Residences at Tiong Bahru, and The Sorrento at West Coast Road.\n\n\"Now that the TDSR has been in play for nine months, the dust has somewhat settled and buying volume is likely to improve in tandem with the anticipated launch of attractive and well-located residential projects,\" said Colliers' Ms Chia.\n\nMr Ismail said existing launches are still fairly muted compared to pre-TDSR days as buyers become more selective and await more attractive entry points.\n\nBut he believes that the underlying demand for real estate investment is still present, going by the encouraging sales performance of Rivertrees Residences and Riverbank @ Fernvale in the mass market segment, and Hallmark Residences from the high-end segment.\n\n\"Potential buyers could be waiting for good bargains to come, so the key is to find the right price point at which buyers are comfortable with.\"\n\nThe figures exclude executive condos (ECs), a private-public housing hybrid. Including ECs, developers moved 535 units in March, lower than the 787 units in February this year and 3,072 units last March.\n\nURA will release the final Q1 2014 figures on April 25.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Last year, its income from its total SME segment rose 11 per cent over the year to $1.37 billion - with most of it from Hong Kong and Singapore. It expects to grow at the same rate this year.\n\nNow, with OCBC making its $6.2 billion bid for Hong Kong's Wing Hang, it is digging its heels into the China-linked trade financing space. This is especially apparent once the deal is stacked against OCBC's earlier proposal to raise its stake in Bank of Ningbo, which is strong in trade financing, and SME lending.\n\nUnited Overseas Bank (UOB) is also eager to tap into Asian trade, setting up a foreign exchange advisory and trading unit last month that specifically caters to SMEs. But unlike DBS and OCBC, it has been concentrating on trade closer to home. Over half of the profit from its small businesses unit last year came from South-east Asia, including Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia, its annual report showed. This unit - which did not break out its earnings - posted double-digit growth last year.\n\nThe banks' regional push comes as Singapore SMEs are caught up with cost concerns, and are catching up with the government's productivity movement. Other parts of the world and, in particular, China are worried about rising costs too, but the pressure over productivity seems more acute here.\n\nThe Singapore Business Federation's SME survey last year showed that cost reduction dominated the priorities of SMEs here.\n\nMeanwhile, growth in Sing-dollar business loans - most of which go to the construction, finance, and trade-related industries - has eased for three straight months since December.\n\nTo be sure, banks will keep tabs on their turf, and not just for home advantage. For one thing, they are still seeing some growth. OCBC, which competes head-to-head with UOB in targeting small enterprises, said its SME loan portfolio in Singapore last year had grown, though it held steady at 19 per cent.\n\nAnd while counter-intuitive, DBS is eager to help SMEs save money. It has rolled out a working capital advisory programme to help SMEs unlock trapped cash. The bank wants to acquire clients and build its SME base - the service is free, but SMEs need to have a DBS banking account.\n\nAt the heart of it all, as SMEs here undergo a painful time of restructuring, the effort is aimed at raising the quality of SMEs, which works in the banks' favour. Against tougher regulations that cast a bigger spotlight on risk weightage, banks have to be picky on SMEs. Analysts now expect some mergers and acquisitions (M&As) among SMEs here this year, which could lead to bigger, better SMEs.\n\nMeanwhile, the government will now take up the bulk of risk for micro-loans taken by young companies, as announced in the Budget this year. Spring Singapore told BT that its financing schemes are targeted at higher risk borrowers. It disbursed $1.25 billion in loans last year - down slightly from $1.3 billion in 2012 - though it threw its weight behind 14 per cent more SMEs over the year.\n\nWith this, Singapore banks can still keep some skin in the game. And in time, homegrown lenders should be able to tap a pool of more solid Singapore-based SMEs that have the mettle to expand into regional powerhouses.\n\nWhen that comes to pass is harder to say, though it must, eventually. For if the productivity push fails, Singapore will have a bigger problem - at 99 per cent, to be exact.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The deal values the company at 547.4 billion yen, about 33 times projected profit for the year ended March.\n\nSeibu, which had disagreements with its biggest shareholder Cerberus Capital Management, sold the shares at 30 per cent less than an indicative price announced last month.\n\nTakashi Goto, president of the hotel and rail operator, has pushed to proceed with the IPO, while Cerberus said that it wanted to wait for a higher price and ultimately decided not to offer any shares in the sale.\n\n\"I think this is reflective of poor sentiment for Japan's IPO market,\" said Benjamin Collett, Hong Kong-based head of Asian equities at Sunrise Brokers. \"They have to price it lower subject to demand, which makes the chances of the price going up post-IPO higher.\"\n\nThe company is selling 27.826 million shares, an 8 per cent stake, held by its other main shareholders. A total of 18.1 million shares will be sold in Japan and 9.7 million overseas. The company plans to debut on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section next Wednesday, it said.\n\nThe 1,600 yen price compares with the 1,400 yen a share Cerberus paid to buy stock from shareholders last year when it boosted its stake to 35.5 per cent.\n\nSeibu, which isn't selling shares, had planned to price the stock from 1,600 yen to 1,800 yen each, it said last week.\n\nThe transaction comes after Japan Display dropped 15 per cent in its Tokyo debut last month and Hitachi Maxell, an electronics and memory storage manufacturer, fell 14 per cent below its IPO price a day earlier.\n\nSeibu's net income for the year ended March probably rose 4.8 per cent to 16.4 billion yen, or 47.81 yen a share, the company said on April 2.\n\nImperial Hotel, which runs one of Tokyo's largest hotels, trades at about 56 times earnings, while East Japan Railway Co, the nation's biggest train line operator, is valued at 15.1 times, according to the earnings forecasts released by the companies in January.\n\nSeibu, which delisted in 2004, is returning to public markets after Mr Goto prevailed in a fight with New York-based Cerberus last year over strategy and board representation.\n\nCerberus's bid to have executives, including former US vice-president Dan Quayle and former US treasury secretary John Snow, elected to the company's board was voted down at a June shareholder meeting. The two sides brought in lawyers after discussions broke down and only resumed direct talks in December, according to two people familiar with the situation.\n\nCerberus, which owns 35.5 per cent of Seibu, had suggested the company sell its professional baseball team and some less-used train lines. Mr Goto rejected the ideas. He got public support from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, who said in March last year that Seibu plays an important role in public transport and its baseball team has \"a lot of fans\". Seibu is betting on growth at its hotel and real estate businesses as a weaker yen unleashes a tourism boom and the capital prepares to host the 2020 Summer Olympics.\n\nMr Goto focused his pitch to institutional investors on the domestic hotel business, which accounted for 17 per cent of operating profit in the latest reporting period. The group's larger transportation business, which generates almost half of total operating income, is the slowest-growing division.\n\nMr Abe's policies to bolster economic growth by pushing down the yen helped raise inbound visitors to more than 10 million for the first time last year. That's helping Seibu fill rooms at properties such as Shinagawa Prince Hotel, which is triple the size of the Waldorf Astoria in New York.\n\n\"Tokyo is growing and there is a shortage of good hotel space,\" said Edwin Merner, president of Atlantis Investment Research Corp in Tokyo, which manages about US$3 billion in assets. \"They've got some good assets to play with. It has a lot of potential with the right management.\"\n\nOperating income at Seibu's domestic hotel business jumped 49 per cent to 6.7 billion yen in the nine months to Dec 31, while the transportation division's profit on that basis rose 1.6 per cent to 18.7 billion yen.\n\nJapanese stocks are suffering the biggest slump among developed markets this year. The Topix index has fallen 13 per cent this year, emboldening short sellers whose trades made up as much as 36 per cent of daily Tokyo Stock Exchange volume last month.\n\n\"It's a case of bad timing,\" said Minoru Matsuno, president of Value Search Asset Management Co in Tokyo. \"The market isn't good for IPOs currently.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

Currently, the deductible payable for those aged 80 and below for B2 Class wards and above as well as C Class wards is $2,000 and $1,500, respectively. In contrast, the deductibles for those aged 81 to 92 years - who are likely not working - is $3,000 and $2,000, respectively.\n\nThe labour movement has also proposed further tiering of co-insurance to help Singaporeans cope with out-of-pocket expenses, an issue which has been flagged as a major concern.\n\nOn March 1, the MediShield Life review committee recommended that co-insurance rates - or the percentage that patients will have to cover - should come down to 10 per cent for amounts of $5,000 and below, and 5 per cent for amounts above $5,000. NTUC would like co-insurance rates for amounts above $10,000 to be reduced to 3 per cent to help patients with hefty hospital bills.\n\nBesides highlighting the need for a periodic review of MediShield Life every three to five years to ensure its relevance, NTUC urged a review of the duplication of insurance coverage to avoid situations where an employee would have both self-paid insurance and employer-paid insurance.\n\nOther points raised in NTUC's recommendations include having more chronic outpatient treatments being covered under the revised insurance scheme, expanding the Standard Drug List to include new and effective medicines as well as ensuring contributions are made to the Medisave accounts of freelancers and the self-employed.\n\nThe recommendations were based on feedback from eight focus groups that the labour movement held with more than 300 participants, including union leaders, families, youths and pensioners.\n\nAt a press briefing yesterday, NTUC's assistant secretary-general, Cham Hui Fong, said there would have to be trade-offs since greater coverage would inevitably lead to higher premiums. But for those recommendations which the government agrees should be included, efforts can be made to find ways to address the issue of higher premiums.\n\n\"Pre-funding is certainly one scheme that is very welcome because it helps younger people pay more in their younger days than when they're older,\" she added.\n\nIn response to the recommendations, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a release yesterday: \"Alongside the shift to MediShield Life, MOH has, in the past few years, significantly increased subsidies and government expenditure on healthcare. Further enhancements were announced at the recent Budget and Committee of Supply debates.

This was mainly because in the first quarter of 2013, there was a write-back of tax following finalisation of prior years' tax of several companies in Singapore.\n\nWhile property trading is still the key contributor to the group's net profit, its contribution fell 37.4 per cent to $35.6 million due to a high base effect as Phase 6 of The Botanica and Marina Bay Suites were completed last year.\n\nNet profit from property investment was 8.9 per cent higher at $29.3 million on the back of strong office leasing demand. Its fund management profit also grew 14.9 per cent to $13.1 million.\n\nIn terms of geography, profit from overseas jumped 63.8 per cent to $26.7 million last quarter on the back of stronger contribution from China residential projects, namely The Springdale and 8 Park Avenue in Shanghai.\n\nOf the 660 overseas homes sold by Keppel Land in the first quarter, 570 units were in China.\n\nIn Singapore, however, residential sales slowed to 54 units from 59 units a year ago, no thanks to the Chinese New Year holidays and the mortgage limits imposed by the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) framework. These sales came mainly from The Glades at Tanah Merah, a joint project with China's top developer Vanke that has sold close to 170 out of 726 units.\n\nKeppel Land said it will continue to scale up in the core markets of Singapore and China. Its city fringe condominium project in Tiong Bahru, Highline Residences, will be \"launch-ready\" in the second quarter.\n\nIt will also launch the first phase of two residential projects in China - Waterfront Residence in Nantong and Hill Crest Villa in Chengdu - in the second half of this year, and will roll out new units at Seasons Residence and The Springdale in Shanghai.\n\nThe group is also deepening its presence in growth markets Indonesia and Vietnam. It has acquired a prime residential site in West Jakarta, Indonesia, which is expected to yield about 3,000 homes and ancillary shophouses. In Vietnam, the group is looking to launch more units at the Riviera Point in District 7, a popular residential suburb.\n\nKeppel Land's wholly owned fund management arm Alpha Investment Partners has also acquired a site in Taipei through its Alpha Asia Macro Trends Fund II to develop luxury apartments.\n\nShares of Keppel Land closed 1.4 per cent higher at $3.50 yesterday before the group's results were released.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The boat will stop using the towed pinger locator and instead rely on the submersible to find debris as the search for Flight MH370 stretches into the 38th day.\n\nScouring the ocean surface for debris with planes and ships will be called off in two to three days as the chance of any floating material being recovered has \"greatly diminished\", Mr Houston said. An oil slick has also been found in the same area and will be analysed.\n\nThe towed pinger locator pulled by the Ocean Shield heard no further signals after picking up four sounds between April 5 and April 8. Australian officials said yesterday that they are deploying planes to scour about 47,644 square kilometres of water, down from 57,506 sq km on Sunday.\n\nPings heard by Chinese vessel Haixun 01 were analysed and have been discounted, Mr Houston told reporters.\n\n\"At the moment this is really all we've got,\" he said. \"We've got no visual objects, the only thing we have left at this stage are four transmissions and an oil slick in the same vicinity. So we will investigate those to their conclusion.\"\n\nThe Bluefin-21, equipped with side-scan sonar, will be deployed for 24 hours at a time. It will spend two hours descending, 16 hours on the ocean bottom, two hours returning to the surface, and four hours having its data downloaded, Mr Houston said.\n\nIt was to be launched last night and search an area of about 40 sq km to produce a high-resolution, three-dimensional sonar map of the seabed, he said.\n\nThe towed pinger locator can't be operated at the same time as Bluefin-21, which doesn't relay information while diving, Mr Houston said. Data returned by yesterday's search will be used to determine search zones for subsequent sweeps.\n\nAt the search area, the depth of the ocean is \"on the right side\" of 4,500 metres, the maximum diving depth of the submersible, he said. The sea floor is probably covered in silt with a topography that's \"flat and almost rolling\", he said.\n\n\"This is an area that is new to man,\" he said of the ocean bottom in the area. \"We're actually gathering information about the search environment all the time.\"\n\nThe centre of yesterday's search areas is 2,200 kilometres north-west of Perth, with as many as 12 aircraft and 15 ships taking part, Australia's Joint Agency Coordination Centre said. No confirmed acoustic detections have been made over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe black boxes are key to determining why the plane disappeared on March 8 en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur, reversing course and flying into some of the world's most remote ocean waters. The pingers' batteries are now a week beyond their 30-day projected life at full power.\n\nThe Ocean Shield detected two signals on April 5 and two more on April 8, which authorities have linked to the beacons on the Boeing Co 777-200ER's black box recorders. That raised optimism in the search. Hopes faded on April 11 when the JACC said an initial assessment of a fifth potential transmission wasn't related to an aircraft black box.\n\nMalaysia's attorney general is in the UK discussing with officials of the International Civil Aviation Organisation and other legal experts on who gets the custody of the black boxes, when they are found, Malaysia's Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday, according to comments confirmed by his office.\n\n\"I would caution you against raising hopes that the deployment of the autonomous underwater vehicle will result in the detection of the aircraft wreckage,\" Mr Houston said. \"It may not.

Brisbane Airport Corp and Airport Motorway Trust, which finances Sydney's Eastern Distributor toll road, were the next best. The gauge as a whole provided a 2.5 per cent gain, compared with 2 per cent for government debt, 1.9 per cent for financials and 4.3 per cent for US industrial bonds.\n\nInvestors in Australian debt are clamouring for the extra yield and diversity offered by corporate notes as the government looks to spur construction amid a waning resources boom. Notes linked to regulated monopolistic assets with more predictable cash flows are finding favour as issuance by non-financial companies slowed to a pace unseen in almost two years and muted credit demand capped sales by banks.\n\n\"The new deals from infrastructure names, although a rarity this year, have been standout performers in the secondary market, while for financials it's been a bit more mixed,\" said Phil Miall, head of credit research and strategy at QIC Ltd, which manages about A$76 billion (S$89 billion).\n\nNew bond sales are struggling to keep up with demand and a rally in credit has driven spreads on corporate notes to near their lowest level in six years, Bank of America data shows. Non-financial companies including Perth Airport Pty sold A$1.125 billion of notes in Australia in the first three months of this year, the slowest quarter since June 2012.\n\n\"Some of these transport-related borrowers are newer names in the market and their performance may have been helped by the fact that there was a bit of a yield premium on the initial issue, so there was more scope for spread tightening,\" said Anthony Kirkham, the Melbourne- based head of investment management at Western Asset Management Co, which oversees about A$18 billion locally. Mr Kirkham, speaking by phone on April 9, said he continues to favour holding infrastructure-related bonds.\n\nThe yield premium over the swap rate on Perth Airport's new 2021 bond narrowed to 137 basis points yesterday, according to Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd prices, having been issued at a 165 basis-point spread last month.\n\nOther borrowers that have come to market this year include electricity distributor CitiPower I Pty, New Zealand dairy producer Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd and SGSP Australia Assets Pty, a manager of energy networks. The University of Sydney last week made its debut bond offering, selling A$200 million of seven-year bonds.\n\nThe average yield premium over the sovereign rate for non-financial company notes in Australia this month fell as low as 131 basis points, the least since November 2007, Bank of America data shows. The spread over the swap rate reached 112, near the 111 basis-point low touched in March 2013 that was the least since the same month in 2008.\n\nSales slowed this year after A$4.5 billion of deals in the final three months of 2013 that included debuts by Aurizon and north Queensland port operator Adani Abbot Point Terminal Pty.\n\nNon-financial corporate bond sales for the 12 months through December were A$9.81 billion, down 18 per cent from the previous year. Total syndicated bond issuance in Australia, including sales by governments and banks, climbed to A$111.6 billion last year from A$108.6 billion in 2012. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

As investors flock to funds designed to make money even if interest rates increase, Mr Gross's Pacific Investment Management Co (Pimco) is alone among the biggest bond managers in suffering withdrawals from the strategy.\n\nIn a category that's been the most popular choice for fixed-income investors this year, the Pimco Unconstrained Bond Fund, has lost US$2.7 billion to redemptions. Similar offerings from Goldman Sachs Group, JPMorgan Chase & Co and BlackRock have seen a surge of deposits from investors seeking to avoid potential bond-market losses. The Pimco fund has trailed a majority of peers over the past five years, and has lagged behind most rivals over the past year.\n\n\"Pimco has kind of shot themselves in the foot here,\" said Steve Roge, a money manager with Bohemia, New York-based R. Roge & Co, where he helps oversee US$225 million. \"In a new category where there are other choices, why is someone going to look at a fund that has been a bottom performer?\" said Mr Roge, who owns several Pimco funds, but has no money in Pimco Unconstrained.\n\nThe redemptions from the fund are particularly painful for Pimco because bond managers are counting on the flexible strategy to attract money as investors flee traditional funds in anticipation of the end of a bull market in bonds. Mr Gross's Pimco Total Return Fund suffered record redemptions last year after the 70-year-old manager misjudged the impact of the Federal Reserve's move to scale back its bond-buying programme - a mistake echoed by the Unconstrained Fund.\n\nNon-traditional funds\n\nNon-traditional funds attracted US$12.6 billion in the first three months of this year, with offerings from Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and BlackRock collecting a combined US$10.7 billion through March, according to data from Chicago-based Morningstar.\n\nLast year, the US$24.3 billion Pimco Unconstrained Bond Fund was Pimco's best-selling mutual fund as investors added US$8.7 billion. Industrywide, unconstrained or flexible funds as a group collected US$55 billion last year. Intermediate funds, the biggest category of bond funds, which includes Pimco Total Return, saw withdrawals of US$79 billion, Morningstar data show.\n\nThe redemptions over the past year mark a new phase for Pimco, which has more than doubled assets since 2008 as investors fled to the perceived safety of bonds following the financial crisis. As that rally has come to an end, Mr Gross and the Newport Beach, California-based company he co-founded in 1971 have faced their share of challenges this year.\n\nIn January, Mr Gross's heir apparent, Mohamed El-Erian, unexpectedly announced his resignation as chief executive officer and co-chief investment officer. His departure was followed by reports of tension between the two. Mr Gross lashed out at Mr El-Erian in a June meeting as performance stumbled and withdrawals continued, two people familiar with the matter said this year.\n\nPimco Total Return suffered record redemptions of US$41.1 billion last year and lost its title as the world's biggest mutual fund. Clients pulled an estimated net US$3.1 billion from the fund and US$7.3 billion from all of Pimco's US mutual funds in March, according to Morningstar. Pimco's assets under management declined to US$1.94 trillion as at March 31, from a peak of US$2.04 trillion last March. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": []}

Across England and Wales, values rose 2.6 per cent to \u00a3262,594 also an all-time high, amid a lack of property for sale in southern England.\n\nBritain's housing market is being fuelled by strengthening economic growth, record-low borrowing costs and official incentive programmes.\n\nIn London, where cash-rich buyers and overseas investors seeking safe assets are also stoking demand, rising house values are spilling into surrounding areas, according to Rightmove.\n\n\"While much of the growth since October 2007 is down to the boom in London, the ripple effect from the capital means other southern regions are starting to play catch-up,\" Rightmove director Miles Shipside said in the report. \"Supply in much of the south is ridiculously tight.\" The north London boroughs of Brent, Camden and Haringey each saw asking prices rise more than 7 per cent this month from March, Rightmove said. Only Richmond-upon-Thames recorded a decline - 0.5 per cent.\n\nOut of 10 regions in England and Wales, the West Midlands was alone in seeing property values drop. As well as London, the south-east, the south-west and East Anglia rose to all-time highs. Northern regions are on average 6 per cent below their October 2007 levels, Rightmove said.\n\nWhile a 13 per cent increase in the number of properties coming to market over the past year may help to ease price pressures, the imbalance between supply and demand is more stark in the south, Rightmove said. This helped values on average to rise 3.5 per cent in the southern regions in April from March, compared with a 0.8 per cent gain in the north.\n\n\"While there are some hotspots emerging in the north, the momentum is not nearly as fast-paced and the better match between supply and demand means that the market is running at more sustainable levels,\" Mr Shipside said.\n\nThe strength in the housing market, partly fuelled by the government's Help to Buy programme, has prompted Bank of England officials to warn that they are ready to act should values look like they are spiralling out of control. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

This was driven partially by the higher contribution from mobile services, bolstered by a 7.1 per cent increase in postpaid revenue to $145.1 million on greater data usage.\n\nAccording to M1 yesterday, 54 per cent of its postpaid customers are on tiered data plans and of that proportion, 16 per cent of users bust their monthly data usage limits. For the quarter, average revenue for per user (ARPU) in the postpaid segment rose 2 per cent to $62.30.\n\nPrepaid revenue, on the other hand, fell 10.4 per cent to $18.7 million, partially because of lower usage and additional bonus credits given to users in order to encourage top-ups of their prepaid card.

The telco has since announced an early-bird price of $94.16 that is valid until this Thursday.\n\nThis amount, said Mr Wong, is the same as what it cost to subscribe to the last World Cup at the regular rate four years ago.\n\nDuring a lively exchange with four different MPs as they debated the soaring cost of subscribing to the World Cup on pay-TV, Mr Wong said it was unlikely that SingTel would make any money from the month-long tournament.\n\nThe telco has not disclosed how much it forked out for the broadcast rights. Mr Wong said that, based on all the revenue that it was currently receiving for the World Cup, it would not be enough to recover the acquisition costs.\n\n\"This is not a matter of (SingTel) profiting or getting a handsome dividend from acquiring this package,\" he said.\n\nOverall, he noted that the acquisition cost of broadcasting the World Cup matches had gone up by between 20 per cent and 40 per cent around the world, compared with the last tournament in 2010.\n\nIn Singapore's case, the pay-TV operators here are aware that there is a certain range that Fifa looks at before it agrees to sell the rights to broadcast the World Cup.\n\n\"It's a narrow range, but you need to pay that amount of money in order to get the rights,\" he explained.\n\nMr Wong also said the government remained committed to ensuring that major sporting events, in particular those of national significance, are available to all Singaporeans and not just on pay-TV.\n\nThere are many events on the Media Development Authority's (MDA) anti-siphoning list, including four key World Cup matches - the opening game between Brazil and Croatia, the two semi-finals and the final.\n\nWhen asked why MDA did not put all the World Cup games on the anti-siphoning list, he reasoned that pay-TV operators would then have little incentive to acquire the content.\n\nInstead, the cost burden would have to be borne largely by the free-to-air broadcaster, which in Singapore's case would be MediaCorp. Doing so would divert a \"significant portion\" of the funds needed for public service broadcasts.\n\n\"MDA has to achieve a delicate balance. It should not be hasty to adopt populist measures that ultimately backfire, leaving consumers even worse off,\" Mr Wong cautioned.\n\nHe said that the government would be conducting a review of the existing cross-carriage policy - which requires pay-TV operators to share exclusive content with one another - as part of a larger review of the Media Market Conduct Code later this year.\n\nThe anti-siphoning list, which the public was last consulted on in 2012, will also be reviewed in due course, he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He said: \"If we don't change now, we will eventually be forced or penalised to change by regulation. While the market is still good and investment in research and development is still affordable, adjustment is less painful.\"\n\nSince then, Vanke has explored new techniques in developed countries; it has also invested in R&D in Dongguan to study prefabrication techniques. These efforts have paid off in terms of brand equity and lowered the cost of complying with higher green standards, he said.\n\nWhen China launched the non-mandatory green buildings standards known as the Green Three Star (GTS) System in 2007, developers found that it cost them an extra $120 per square metre (psm) to build a GTS project.\n\nBut Vanke's prefabrication technique enabled it to adapt to the requirements of green projects more easily and more cheaply; GTS projects cost the firm only $30 more psm. Mr Wang said: \"By choosing prefabrication earlier on, it was much easier for us to comply with high level green standards.\"\n\nHe lamented, however, about the lack of clarity in green policies in China, where \"green-minded politicians are less likely to be promoted\".\n\nAmid a trend of Chinese developers venturing into overseas projects, Vanke has teamed up with US developers RFR Holding LLC and Hines to develop and market a new high-end residential building in New York.\n\nThe company has also received approval from the Hong Kong regulator to transfer its B-shares in mainland China to H-shares in Hong Kong, marking its exit from the mainland's languishing B-share market.\n\nSome observers expect its Hong Kong listing to take place as soon as June.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It changed its name to SunMoon that year.\n\nA key lender was private equity firm First Alverstone Capital (FACL), which now owns 39 per cent of SunMoon.\n\nFACL was in an investment vehicle known as FACT 2006 along with QAP Capital, held by Mr Tan's sisters.\n\nLast September, SunMoon settled its remaining $24.4 million of legacy debt through a cash and share settlement to creditors.\n\nSunMoon closed at 0.1 cent, down 50 per cent, before the announcement was made.

Much stronger interest lay instead in funds that take on event-driven or pure-equity strategies.\n\nOn the back of more positive sentiment reflected last year, investors expect assets under management of hedge funds to grow at least 12 per cent this year, to hit an all-time high of US$2.8 trillion. This means an additional US$300 billion for the industry, a result of both better performance and new capital inflows.\n\nA large majority of investors expect positive returns for hedge funds this year, with returns forecast to hit about 7 per cent on average.\n\nIn strategy terms, the biggest surge in demand on a net basis came in the event-driven category.\n\nFunds that use such a strategy invest in distressed companies, or try to get onto corporate boards to steer a company in the fund's strategic direction.\n\nIn explaining the demand for the event-driven strategy, the survey noted that current mergers-and-acquisitions activity is at a third of normal levels; it is expected to pick up with stronger business confidence ahead.\n\nThe survey said: \"Financing remains relatively cheap, and corporates are finding it cheaper to buy than build, which typically has a longer payback time.\"\n\nHalf of those surveyed expect the equity strategy to continue contributing the strongest performance among all hedges this year. The equity hedge, also known as the long/short hedge, involves buying undervalued stocks and shorting overvalued stocks.\n\nOn the flip side, net demand for funds that focus on emerging markets' equities and credit fell by about 20 per cent over the year.\n\nThis is Credit Suisse's sixth annual hedge fund investor survey. The more than 500 respondents included family offices and institutional funds, with nearly 90 per cent of them headquartered in the West.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We expect from September and into next year there will be a spike.\"\n\nKhalifa Port, built on a man-made island roughly half-way between Abu Dhabi and Dubai, came on stream in 2012 after Zayed Port, which had been serving Abu Dhabi for more than 40 years, reached full capacity.\n\nThe new port faces competition from other rapidly growing facilities in the region including Dubai's huge Jebel Ali port, which is only about 40 kilometres north along the Gulf coast.\n\nMr Shamisi's projections, however, suggest that demand related to Abu Dhabi's construction projects will keep activity at Khalifa growing for a while.\n\nAbu Dhabi is investing billions of dollars in infrastructure, real estate and tourism to diversify its economy beyond oil.\n\nStrategic projects underway or in the pipeline include the expansion of Abu Dhabi International Airport, the Abu Dhabi Louvre museum and construction of a nuclear power station, where the first reactor is expected to start operations in 2017 and others are planned to follow in 2020.\n\nADPC is owner, operator and developer of Abu Dhabi's civilian non-oil ports and also its industrial zones.\n\nIt is therefore expected to benefit from expansion plans scheduled for industries located in the adjacent Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi, which is projected to provide 15 per cent of Abu Dhabi's non-oil gross domestic product by 2030.\n\n\"Through Khalifa Port, Emirates Aluminium (Emal), for example, receives all of its raw materials and exports its aluminium to all over the world, and now that they are increasing their capacity, this will increase the traffic as well,\" Mr Shamisi said.\n\nEmal's US$4 billion project to boost its aluminium production capacity from around 800,000 tonnes a year to 1.3 million tonnes is ahead of schedule and expected to near completion in mid-2014.\n\nOther manufacturers using Abu Dhabi ports include Emirates Steel, which is projected to import around five million tonnes of raw material in 2014, and plastics and polymers maker Borouge.\n\nKhalifa Port now has an annual capacity of 2.5 million TEUs, which could be raised to five million TEUs in the first phase of the port's development depending on demand.\n\nAbu Dhabi's long-term goal is to increase capacity to 15 million TEUs of containers and 35 million tonnes of bulk cargo by 2030.\n\nAll container traffic was transferred from Zayed Port, in Abu Dhabi's city centre, to the new Khalifa Port when it opened in 2012. Zayed still handles some general cargo.\n\n\"Port Zayed will continue to serve Abu Dhabi but we want it now to focus on cruise vessels,\" Mr Shamisi said.\n\nNinety-two cruise vessels called at the port in 2013 with over 160,000 tourists visiting Abu Dhabi through the port. Construction of a permanent terminal to receive tourist ships is underway.\n\n\"The facilities that are there now are working but are only temporary, and we are working on having permanent facilities for cruise vessels and developing the infrastructure,\" Mr Shamisi said.\n\n\"This is a natural cycle for ports, where the city grows around the port and then the facility reaches full capacity and is transformed into a tourist hub while commercial activity moves elsewhere.\" - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Inflation, however, remains a sticky problem.\n\nIn light of this, the central bank has decided to keep the Singapore dollar appreciating along the same \"modest and gradual\" path it has stuck to since April 2012 - to ward off persistent wage pressures that will push core inflation higher.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) core inflation measure - which excludes more volatile car and home prices - has risen to an average of 2 per cent year-on-year over the five months from October 2013 to February this year, from 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of 2013.\n\n\"This was predominantly due to a more significant pass-through of wages and other business costs,\" the central bank said. And despite the strengthening currency and subdued price pressures abroad, import prices in Singapore dollars also rose slightly in recent months, it said.\n\nMarket economists had accurately predicted both the policy decision, as well as the lower 2014 headline inflation forecast. MAS downgraded this to 1.5-2.5 per cent from an earlier 2-3 per cent given that the large supply of new housing units implies a weaker outlook for imputed rentals and car prices should \"add negligibly\" to inflation.\n\nBut this lower headline inflation forecast remained \"subservient\" to elevated core inflation when it came to the policy decision, as OCBC currency strategist Emmanuel Ng put it.\n\nIndeed, MAS warned that though imported inflation will be benign, domestic costs - particularly wage pressures from the tight labour market - could mean that sequential core price increases will be slightly higher than the historical average this year.\n\n\"Firms are expected to continue to pass on accumulated costs, which could lead to broad-based price increases across the economy,\" MAS said.\n\nThe policy trade-offs of the central bank's decision this round were fewer, as the economy is expected to trot out a modest pace of recovery, notwithstanding the uncertain start in Q1.\n\nAdvance estimates released by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) show that Q1 GDP growth came in weaker than the market had expected, moderating in both year-on-year and sequential terms.\n\nThe economy expanded 5.1 per cent in Q1 compared to a year ago - lower than Q4's 5.5 per cent - as a slowdown in the services sector dragged down gains from the manufacturing sector.\n\nOverall GDP fell short of the consensus forecast. The 18 private sector economists polled by Bloomberg had a median year-on-year growth forecast of 5.4 per cent.\n\nGrowth in the services sector eased to 4.7 per cent compared with a year ago, lower than the 5.9 per cent growth seen in Q4. This was due to slower expansion in the wholesale & retail trade, and finance & insurance sectors.\n\nDespite the slip, Mizuho economist Vishnu Varathan believes that the services sector will remain a key pillar of growth this year. And DBS's Irvin Seah expects Q1 GDP to be adjusted upwards in May, \"given the current conservative estimate in terms of (services') growth momentum\".\n\nThe manufacturing and construction sectors, however, performed better. Manufacturing grew at a faster pace of 8 per cent in Q1, boosted by higher biomedical and chemicals output. The latter benefited from public construction projects, and grew 6.5 per cent year-on-year.\n\nDespite the weaker-than-expected showing in overall Q1 GDP, both the government and private sector economists remain sanguine about growth prospects this year.\n\nNotwithstanding Q1's weaker performance, MAS said that \"the level of economic activity should stay on a broad upward trajectory for the rest of the year\".\n\nEconomists Michael Wan of Credit Suisse and Francis Tan of UOB agree. They say that Singapore's trade-related sectors should expand as the global economy - and particularly the US and Europe - stages a stronger recovery.\n\nStill, the MAS warned that \"overall growth will be capped by supply-side constraints, particularly in the labour market\".\n\nThe government has maintained its 2014 growth forecast of 2-4 per cent, even as it warned that \"the growth profile could be uneven\". Economists' projections are largely at or beyond the upper end of this band, with growth forecasts ranging from 3.5-4.3 per cent.\n\nWhile the next policy review is not due till October, economists from ANZ and Credit Suisse believe the hurdle for easing monetary policy is \"still extremely high\". Mr Wan noted that the tightness in the labour market showed no signs of easing, given that a fresh round of foreign manpower restrictions are due in July, with more to come in 2015 and 2016.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The decision, nine months after Philippine Airlines won the same right, marks the second scaling-back of a March 2010 EU prohibition against all Philippines-based carriers.\n\nThe EU said that it removed all carriers based in Swaziland from the blacklist as a result of \"safety information from various sources and hearings\".\n\n\"When countries do what it takes to ensure the safety of their aviation industry, it is important that the EU recognises these efforts,\" European Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas said last week in Brussels.\n\nThis is the 23rd update of a blacklist first drawn up by the European Commission, the EU's regulatory arm, in March 2006 with more than 90 airlines, mainly from Africa. The ban covers passenger and cargo carriers from nations including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Liberia, Sudan and Zambia.\n\nCebu Air said that its current fleet can't fly to Europe while citing London, Paris and Amsterdam as possible future EU destinations. \"We need to make fleet decisions,\" Cebu Air president Lance Gokongwei told reporters in Manila after the EU decision. He gave no timeline for a decision on starting flights to Europe.\n\nAirline crashes in 2004 and 2005 that killed hundreds of European travellers prompted EU governments to seek a uniform approach to airline safety through a common blacklist. The list, updated generally twice a year, is based on deficiencies found during checks at European airports, the use of antiquated aircraft and shortcomings by non-EU regulators.\n\nIn addition to imposing an operational ban in Europe, the blacklist can act as a guide for travellers worldwide and influence safety policies in non-EU countries.\n\nNations that are home to carriers with poor safety records can ground them to avoid being put on the EU list, while countries keen to keep out unsafe foreign airlines can use the European list as a guide for their own bans. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

But reality kicked in after two years when the startup ran low on funds, and was compelled to introduce pricing. Today, it offers both free and paid live chat plans that are used by over 100,000 websites in 150 countries.\n\n\"2010 was a clear turning point for us. Post 2010, we raised some money from NUS and Spring, and started to offer paid plans. The influx of cash allowed us to hire more designers and engineers, and we reached profitability shortly after,\" said Mr Tay.\n\nSince then, Zopim has seen about 2.5 times growth in revenue and headcount annually. In 2012, it recorded US$1.4 million in revenue and US$289,000 in profits after tax, said sources.\n\n\"Anyone that says starting up a company is easy is lying. But that's where the fun is. The challenges we overcome as entrepreneurs are what makes it rewarding. Paychecks and exits are just a manifestation of overcoming those obstacles,\" Mr Tay said.\n\nThe 31-year-old electrical engineering graduate added that Zopim would not have made it so far if not for the support of NUS and the NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme, of which all four co-founders attended. \"NOC is a brilliant programme that has groomed many entrepreneurs,\" said Mr Tay.\n\nOther startups founded by NOC alumni include mobile marketplace Carousell, as well as digital marketing company Techsailor, which was acquired by India's digital services network, To The New, last July.\n\nThe Zopim acquisition, one of the largest known in terms of value for a Singaporean startup, was completed in March and announced on Thursday night (Singapore time) via blog posts by Zopim and Zendesk.\n\nThe latter also filed for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, in which it seeks to raise up to US$150 million, according to the S-1 filing notes.\n\nFinancial details of the Zopim acquisition - while not disclosed in any blog post or press release - were published in the S-1. Zendesk will make an upfront payment of US$15.9 million to Zopim, and pay out the remaining US$13.9 million in cash and shares over the next two to three years, subject to Zopim staff's continued employment.\n\n\"We are thrilled to add (Zopim) to our family of products ... to accelerate our chat functionality and bring to our users ... an intuitive, transparent, and fun ... product they can use to engage their customers in real-time,\" said Adrian McDermott, senior vice- president of product development at Zendesk.\n\nAs part of the acquisition, Zendesk will be phasing out its own live chat software and concentrating future development efforts on Zopim's \"far superior\" one. Zendesk customers will also get to enjoy a Zopim Lite plan which will come with all Zendesk plans from May. Meanwhile, the entire Zopim team, comprising close to 30 members, will be joining Zendesk but continue to be based in Singapore.\n\n\"It's also worth mentioning that the Zopim team and culture attracted us to the company as much as their product,\" added Mr McDermott.\n\nAccording to co-founder Mr Tay, Zopim is a company that never takes itself too seriously.\n\n\"We look out for people who believe work can be fun and know how to have fun. We also give our employees a lot of freedom and responsibility,\" he said, adding that his job is to provide them with the direction, resources and environment to succeed.\n\nPing pong is also a common feature of the Zopim office. Employees are likely to be engaged in the sport or standing around with beer bottles and cheering the players on, in the middle of the day.\n\n\"Our employees know we assess them based on performance and work delivery, not the facade of doing work. I can say Zendesk is like that too, which was why we felt there was such a huge fit,\" said Mr Tay.\n\nOther notable exits by local startups include the buyout of video streaming site Viki by Rakuten for US$200 million, and that of vehicle classifieds site sgCarMart by Singapore Press Holdings for US$48 million.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

If the match ends in a draw, both CEOs will donate $1,000 each.\n\nThe maximum each CEO will eventually fork out in this month-long tournament is $8,000. And because the donations qualify for tax deduction, using corporate funds would score well for the company.\n\nParticipating CEOs will be featured in BT's daily World Cup page whenever their team plays, along with a short comment on the impending match. These corporate chiefs don't need to know the technicalities of the game; even light-hearted banter amid soccer's most sacrosanct event will not be considered irreverent.\n\nMs McLaren said: \"There's nothing more powerful than getting businesses to work together to make things happen for a good cause.\"\n\nMs McLaren hails from England, works in an American company and is stationed much of the time in the Asia-Pacific, but, reflecting Coca-Cola's global flavour, she picks hosts Brazil to win the Cup.\n\nShe has this message for fellow CEOs: \"We are happy to be part of this and wish for more companies to come forward and support these two worthy charities in a fun way!\"\n\nOne business leader who will throw his hat into the ring is NTUC FairPrice chief Seah Kian Peng, whose heart is with England but is open to be assigned any team. He said: \"I'd be happy to adopt any country, as it is all for a good cause.\"\n\nBT editor Alvin Tay, an avid World Cup fan himself, said: \"What's more, it's a creative way to disburse corporate funds that have been set aside for charity.\"\n\nOnce 32 CEOs have signed up, a draw will determine who adopts which country.\n\nCoca-Cola, an official partner of Brazil 2014, has had a long association with local sport and international mega events, including the Olympics.\n\nBT ran a similar campaign for the 2006 World Cup and raised $128,000 in donations.

However, those prepared to take a longer-term view may want to retain all or part of their shareholdings in GPH, it added.\n\n\"We are of the view that the financial terms of the offer, on balance, are fair from the market share price and historical price-earnings ratio (PER) perspective, but are not so compelling from the net asset value (NAV) perspective,\" said Provenance Capital. The offer represents a premium of about 13.8 per cent from the last transacted price of GPH's shares of 29 cents on March 12 and also values GPH on a PER of approximately 17.9 times.\n\nAs at Dec 31, 2013, GPH's NAV and NAV per share were about $673.19 million and 64 cents respectively, the circular said.\n\nOne of Singapore's largest hotel chains, GPH operates hotels under its \"Fragrance\" and \"Parc Sovereign\" brands.\n\nProvenance Capital also said that the likelihood of competing offers was remote. Mr Koh has given notice that he does not plan to increase the offer price.\n\nTogether with the valid acceptances for the offer so far, Mr Koh and parties acting in concert with him, currently own or control approximately 71.21 per cent of GPH.\n\nThe company's independent directors said that they agreed with Provenance's advice.\n\nThe closing date for the offer is 5.30pm on April 24.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Alternatively, say market watchers, a long-speculated scenario may finally start to play out: Wheelock could participate in a co-development of some of HPL's prized assets in the Orchard Road belt: such as the Hilton and Four Seasons hotels, Forum and HPL House.\n\nThis speculation has been fuelled on and off ever since Wheelock acquired a 21 per cent stake in HPL in 2006 from GuocoLand. It paid $1.80 per HPL share for a total of $171.4 million.\n\nLast year, Wheelock sold its 17.93 per cent stake in SC Global to its chairman Simon Cheong, who took the luxury residential developer private.\n\nWheelock made its request for trading halt on Sunday night while HPL made its request before the start of trading yesterday.\n\nAt press time yesterday, neither company had issued any announcement.\n\nWheelock, which is part of Hong Kong's Wheelock and Co group, was formerly known as Marco Polo Developments.

Firstly, the combined effects of cooling measures and the Total Debt Servicing Ratio framework have softened demand and led to weaker transaction volumes in the private residential market, which have dampened the residential en bloc sales market. Secondly, the government has moderated its supply of residential sites in H1 2014 due to the large pipeline supply - though the cut in land sales is across the board, extending also to commercial and hotel sites.\n\nThe third factor is the interest rate increases, expected to kick in when the United States begins tapering its quantitative easing programme next year, which could raise financing costs and become a drag on investment activity.\n\nAccording to a DTZ Research report released yesterday, in the first three months of this year total real estate investments rose 24 per cent quarter on quarter to $4.7 billion, with residential and office investments accounting for $3.7 billion, or nearly 80 per cent of the overall volume.\n\nMuch of the residential investments were driven by government land sales, which trebled from a quarter ago. Eight residential sites (including five executive condominium sites and a reserve list site at Geylang East Avenue 1) were awarded for $1.9 billion. DTZ included only transactions that were at least $5 million. It also excluded $708 million of transactions in single residential units that cannot be redeveloped or subdivided into more than one plot. The statistics vary among consultants because of different criteria used to define investment sales.\n\nAs for private land sales, according to Colliers, only two residential land parcels changed hands in Q1: 700 Beach on Beach Road from a consortium comprising Hirsch Bedner Associates and Fine Grain Property Consortium (Singapore) which sold for $120 million; and Tee Ventures' acquisition of a plot that houses Longhouse Food Centre on Upper Thomson Road for $45 million.\n\nThe three major office deals in Q1 were OUE Commercial Reit's acquisition of OUE Bayfront for $1 billion for its listing; CapitaLand's sale of Westgate Tower to a joint venture between Low Keng Huat (Singapore) Ltd and Sun Venture Homes for $579 million; and an acquisition of a 50 per cent stake in Finexis Building on Robinson Road by Singapore-based Sin Capital Partners for $124 million.\n\nThis year, the commercial and hospitality sectors are expected to gain more traction among investors, buoyed by an uptick in office rents and the high occupancy rates and healthy room rates that hotels enjoy. The opening of the Singapore Sports Hub this year is also likely to draw more tourists. Among offices, rents for Grade A office space particularly are rising, benefiting from limited new office supply in the central region of Singapore and a generally improved global market outlook.\n\nBut some consultants caution that interest for private commercial and hotel land parcels could be affected by the government's upward revision in development charges for land approved for intensification or higher-value use.\n\nThe Ministry of National Development earlier this year assigned the steepest upward adjustment of 14.6 per cent on average to the commercial sector, with rate increases for hotel use following closely behind at 13.4 per cent.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Colliers and DTZ Research expect total real estate investment volume in 2014 to be between $20 billion and $25 billion, about 13-20 per cent lower than last year's $28.6 billion.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And more than a month since the flight took off, they remain among the few clues that investigators have as they try to piece together what happened.\n\nLast week, the search vessels moved to an area hundreds of miles northwest of Perth, where Australian and Chinese ships have detected multiple \"pings\" consistent with those of a plane's underwater locator beacons - not far from where Inmarsat's calculations helped narrow estimates of the plane's last location. The most recent of those signals were detected on Wednesday and Thursday, prompting Australian officials leading the search to suggest that remains of the plane could be found soon.\n\nThrough it all, the staff in Inmarsat's east London control room have kept constant tabs on the global flow of mobile voice and data transmissions carried by its network of 11 satellites orbiting 22,000 miles above the Earth. Superimposed upon the 21-foot-long map dominating a wall is a colour-coded mosaic of cells, each spanning several hundred square miles.\n\n\"The nature of our system is such that we can direct communications capacity very quickly to anywhere on the globe,\" said Ruy Pinto, Inmarsat's chief technology officer. \"We are designed for that,\" he added. \"So when there is an event that we feel is going to require additional capacity or resources, we have a group of people that gets together and starts diverting resources to provide terminals, radio frequency and power.\"\n\nWhat Inmarsat's system is not designed for is finding a missing jet.\n\nOne of the most surprising elements of Inmarsat's contribution to the search, according to investigators, was that satellite links could even be used to tease out the plane's last known location.\n\nAs a communications company with US$1.25 billion in revenue and 1,900 employees in more than 60 locations, Inmarsat has grown accustomed to playing a vital supporting role in world events, including conflicts and disaster relief. But in the case of the missing Malaysian jet, the company has found itself thrust, somewhat uncomfortably, into the spotlight.\n\nOn a recent day, the cells over geopolitical hot spots like Crimea, Syria and Afghanistan were lit up in pink or yellow. They reflected a heavy concentration of satellite phones and portable broadband terminals in use by various military, media and relief organisations. Busy sea lanes near the English Channel, the Persian Gulf and the Straits of Malacca were tinted a deep green.\n\nMr Pinto pointed out the patch of activity off the Australian coast. But he and the handful of engineers who did the Flight 370 analysis maintained a stoic reserve.\n\n\"There is no sense of a job well done quite yet, but that will probably come later,\" said Mr Pinto, 54, a Brazilian who joined Inmarsat as a software engineer in 1990. \"There is a strong feeling that why we're doing this is to help the investigation and try to help the families. We are very sure that our emotions, whatever they are, are nothing compared to their emotions, and we are very conscious that the story isn't about us.\"\n\nKnown originally as the International Maritime Satellite Organization, Inmarsat was created in 1979 by the 88-member International Maritime Organization, an arm of the United Nations, and charged with providing a seamless global network for basic ship-to-shore voice and data communications, including free emergency services for ships in distress.\n\nOver the next 30 years, its offering expanded to include hand-held satellite phones and other land-based mobile services as well as air-to-ground technology that today is installed on roughly 90 per cent of the world's fleet of transoceanic wide-body jets.\n\nUnlike employees of better-known tenants of an area of east London known as the \"Silicon Roundabout\" - Amazon, Google, Facebook and Intel all have offices nearby - Inmarsat's workers are less accustomed to seeing their company's name in the headlines.\n\nInmarsat was converted into a private company in 1999, and member states were granted shares that many quickly sold or transferred to national telecom operators. Several attempts at a public share offering failed after the global dotcom bubble burst in 2000, and the company was eventually bought by Apax Partners and Permira, two European private equity firms, for an estimated US$1.5 billion. Inmarsat was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2005 in an initial public offering that valued the company at more than \u00a31.3 billion (S$2.7 billion) at the time. Inmarsat's market capitalisation has since nearly tripled, to about \u00a33.4 billion.\n\nMaritime communications still generate more than half of Inmarsat's sales, while land-based services and bandwidth leasing together represent about 30 per cent of revenues. With a 48 per cent share of the world's mobile satellite communications market, Inmarsat is twice the size of its nearest competitor, Iridium of the United States. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

New York and London topped the list for the fourth straight time.\n\nBeijing's standing rose even as record pollution emerged as a risk that may deter talent and investment. Exploiting its role as capital of the world's second-biggest economy, the city passed Seoul and Singapore. The consultants cited growth in the number of international schools, broadband subscribers and museums in addition to increased international commerce.\n\n\"What we've seen over time is strong business activity and heavyweight political influence are a combination of attributes which really propel cities and Beijing is a perfect example of this,\" said Andres Mendoza Pena, a principal at AT Kearney in Chicago. \"We see Beijing continuing its upward trend.\"\n\nThe firm's index, which will be released today, was based on 26 metrics of how well municipalities spawn, attract and retain talent. The top 10 was rounded out by Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Los Angeles, Chicago, Singapore and Washington. Brussels and Seoul dropped into the second 10. Advances by Shanghai and Guangzhou underscored China's rise.\n\nBeijing's move into the tier is unusual, says AT Kearney. Since the debut of the index in 2008, just 23 cities have occupied the top 20 positions. The next 20 have been followed by 28 different locations and 33 cities have cycled through 41 to 60. \"Below the top 10 you can see serious competition,\" said Mr Mendoza Pena. \"As a result, whole cities are improving so they all need to run to keep up.\"\n\nEven at the pinnacle, New York only offers about 60 per cent of a perfect city, the creation of which would require the cherry picking of the best bits from 16 metropolitan areas, he noted.\n\nEurope and the Asia-Pacific each had seven cities in the top 20, ahead of six in the Americas. In 20th place, Buenos Aires became the first Latin American city to feature so high. Despite Egypt's economic woes and political upheaval, Cairo remained the leading city in Africa.\n\nJumping the most was Istanbul, rising to 28th from 37th, while Boston and Zurich fell the most, dropping six positions to 21st and 31st, respectively.

It is also at a 27 per cent premium to the past one-month volume weighted average price (VWAP) of CMA shares and a 20.7 per cent premium to CMA's net asset value per share as at Dec 31.\n\nArthur Lang, CapitaLand group chief financial officer, described it as a \"fair price\", one which reflects an attractive premium for minority shareholders.\n\nThe offer, funded by internal resources and borrowings, factors in the growth of CMA since its listing in 2009 and the dividends paid out to shareholders over the years, he said.\n\nCapitaMalls, which manages 105 shopping malls, derived 43 per cent of its revenue from China last year, 32 per cent from Singapore and the rest, mostly from Japan and Malaysia.\n\nThe deal is immediately earnings accretive to CapitaLand's shareholders and raises the return on equity from 5.4 per cent to 6.7 per cent.\n\nAnalysts responded positively to the offer yesterday; at least one \"outperform\" rating was issued.\n\nStandard Chartered analyst Regina Lim, who reiterated the \"outperform\" call, said investors may switch to CapitaLand from CMA to access the latter's well-differentiated retail platform.\n\n\"We believe the transaction is a good way to redeploy the cash that CapitaLand received from the divestment of Australand,\" she said, in a reference to CapitaLand's March sale of its remaining 39.1 per cent stake in Australia's Australand Property Group for around A$849 million.\n\nOCBC property analyst Eli Lee said the offer price is \"decent\", given that it represents a 21 per cent premium to book value and a reasonable 8 per cent discount to revised net asset value.\n\n\"CMA's shares have mostly traded below its IPO price ($2.12) since its listing in 2009, due to various structural and macro-economic headwinds, and this provides an opportunity for investors to exit at a reasonable valuation,\" he said.\n\nThe trend here and in China now leans towards integrated projects - those comprising hotel or serviced residence, retail, office and residential components; some pure residential players in China have also moved into mixed developments, CapitaLand's Mr Lim observed.\n\nThe individual components of an integrated project complement one another: pre-sales of residential units generate cashflow to fund the shopping malls and offices, and serviced residences provide the traffic to the malls and higher returns for tenants.\n\nIt is not easy for a single business unit like CMA to undertake such projects, he said. Yet, at the same time, having the shopping mall entity listed \"makes it more cumbersome for (CapitaLand) to undertake such projects\".\n\nPost-delisting of CMA, CapitaLand's structure will be further streamlined. The number of listed entities in the CapitaLand group will be cut from eight to six, Mr Lim said. Development activities will be undertaken by CapitaLand, while most of its stabilised assets will be held in listed Reits.\n\nThere will be no downstream offer for the Reits - CapitaMall Trust and CapitaRetail China Trust - where CMA remains their sponsor with respective deemed stakes of 27.6 per cent and 37.1 per cent.\n\nMorgan Stanley and Credit Suisse are advising CapitaLand on the transaction.\n\nCapitaLand's offer for CMA shares will turn unconditional when 90 per cent of all CMA shares are obtained. CMA said yesterday that its board of directors will form a committee to appoint an independent financial adviser to advise the board on the offer.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Once the shake-out or consolidation is completed, conventional wisdom born of experience gleaned from similar routs over the past five years is stocks should resume upward march. Adding to this confidence were the minutes of the recent Federal Open Markets Committee meeting, which reaffirmed the Fed's dovish stance on interest rates.\n\nMaybe so, but it would be a mistake to assume that the US market can quickly add to the half-dozen all-time high records it has set this year and the 50 last year. Those highs were reached without any major moves in the bond market, suggesting there has been no panic selling of stocks and no major flow of money into bonds - yet. This could now be changing. On Friday, the 30-year Treasury yield closed at its lowest since July last year. A fall in yields was to be expected - when stocks plunge, some capital will seek the safe haven afforded by bonds. The motives, however, behind the bond rallies in the two periods may have been different. Nine months ago, stocks were weak because of worries the US economy was growing fast enough to justify the Fed tapering its monetary stimulus, which would have spelt an end to the liquidity-driven rally of the last few years.\n\nThis time, liquidity is not the issue - having given markets ample time to brace themselves, the Fed has now tapered three times since December, bringing its monthly bond purchases down from US$85 billion per month to US$55 billion. So it is likely that this time, it is worry over the recovery that is the problem. In calling for bolder actions to keep growth on track, the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Christine Lagarde last week said the global recovery was \"too weak for comfort\". Separately, in a research report last week, the IMF noted although real interest rates have been declining since the 1980s and are now in slightly negative territory, this has failed to boost the productive investment that is vital in generating demand for labour and capital.\n\nGlobal growth has been slowing since 2010 and the IMF estimates that growth last year was half a percentage point below the long-term average, notwithstanding massive spare capacity. It raised the possibility of \"a prolonged period of very low growth ('secular stagnation') in advanced economies, especially if new shocks were to hit these economies\". It also said its research suggests emerging economies may have sustained enduring damage because of adverse conditions in developed economies. Emerging economies \"are likely to face a more complex and challenging growth environment than in the period before the global financial crisis\", warned the IMF. With such a murky economic outlook, investors should be wary of claims that US equities will rebound quickly. There is still a long way to go before the damage wrought by 2008's US sub-prime crisis is fully repaired.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The record high was in October 1997, when it was 115.6 per cent.\n\nTo tackle the slide in FDs, banks have increased their payouts and no longer insist on huge amounts to earn at least 1.0 per cent.\n\nUnited Overseas Bank pays 1.20 per cent, the highest FD rate in two years, for an 18-month deposit starting at $20,000.\n\nOCBC said that, to earn 1.05 per cent, the customer will have to place fresh funds of between $5,000 and $50,000 for a period of 18 months.\n\nMaybank offers 1.28 per cent for a 24-month FD of at least $60,000, and HSBC, one per cent for a three-month FD and 1.18 per cent for 12 months for amounts from $50,000.\n\nANZ launched a new promotion with its instant-interest time deposit two weeks ago. For $150,000 and above, it is offering 1.10 per cent on a seven-month tenure; the interest is paid in full to the customer's current or savings account the day the funds are placed.\n\nAn ANZ spokeswoman said that when the instant-interest time deposit was launched a year ago this month, it exceeded its new-client acquisition target by 125 per cent.\n\nThe bank has pulled in $190 million in deposits with this product in a year. The average deposit amount was between $200,000 and $300,000, reflecting the bank's target segment of affluent customers, she said.\n\nPhilip Lim, ANZ's head of retail banking here, said: \"With the recent cooling measures on property and cars, clients' perspectives and priorities on discretionary income have shifted, and they are less willing to take risks with complex investments. They are also more cautious with their money and may decide to postpone big purchases in order to channel their finances into safer options such as savings or time deposit accounts, despite the usually low interest rates.\"\n\nHarmander Mahal, HSBC Singapore's head of customer-value management, retail banking and wealth management, said cash deposits have become core to people's financial portfolio as they focus on protecting their capital and preserving liquidity.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Other formats offer a superior music experience.\n\nUnfortunately, almost all players only play MP3. Hence, Pono, and the Pono Music store, offer musicians and listeners a way to create, download and play advanced music files.\n\nWhat is interesting is how Mr Young decided to finance this startup. He launched a Kickstarter campaign.\n\nKickstarter is one of the biggest and certainly one of the best-known crowdfunding platforms. To date, Kickstarter has raised more than US$1 billion in pledges.\n\nMr Young announced the campaign during a SXSW session on March 11. Within 24 hours, he had raised US$1 million in pledges. Within 28 hours, he raised US$2.5 million.\n\nTo date, the Pono campaign has raised over US$5 million in pledges.\n\nThough the concept of crowdfunding has been around for decades (some say centuries), the first online crowdfunding campaign occurred in the late 1990s, when US-based fans of the British rock band Marillion raised US$60,000 to enable the band to tour the States.\n\nSince then, crowdfunding platforms have expanded to several hundred, serving artists, causes and startups around the world.\n\nTypes of crowdfunding\n\nWhat are the different models of crowdfunding? And what does the crowdfunding phenomenon mean to a startup entrepreneur?\n\nCrowdfunding can be broken down into a few specific categories:\n\nSince the site uses PayPal as its payment processor, CauseVox can be used by Singapore-based social campaigns.\n\nAgain, returning to the Neil Young/Pono campaign, at lower donation levels (starting at US$5) donors would receive signed posters, T-shirts, pins and other stuff. At US$5,000, donors get an invitation to dinner with Neil Young himself.\n\nEquity-based crowdfunding is expanding internationally, albeit a bit slower than rewards-based or donation-based platforms.\n\nRegulators (including those in Singapore) have been relatively slow to come to grips with the new investing realities equity crowdfunding platforms bring.\n\nThe rules are still evolving, particularly in the US, as it relates to Title III rules governing unaccredited investors.\n\nWhich is best?\n\nFor entrepreneurs, the expansion of crowdfunding options is good news, and increases their options to meet early-stage cash needs of a startup.\n\nEach platform provides certain benefits to an entrepreneur. For example, for rewards-based crowdfunding, an entrepreneur can raise money without exchanging equity, and without the legal and reporting demands that come with issuing securities.\n\nOn the other hand, as equity crowdfunding platforms mature, entrepreneurs find themselves with a powerful tool to generate larger amounts of money than in rewards-based platforms (that is, for those entrepreneurs who are not Neil Young).\n\nThat said, the rules governing these platforms, and the platforms themselves, are changing rapidly.\n\nOne could easily expect both expansion in the number of countries that host platforms, and contraction in the number of platforms available to entrepreneurs.\n\nIn other words, crowdfunding, and in particular, equity-based crowdfunding platforms, are an exciting and rapidly evolving tool for entrepreneurs, and will change the startup landscape in positive ways.\n\nThe writer is founder and CEO of Strodtbeck & Co.

Poor planning (40 per cent), knowledge and skills (38 per cent), resources and workload constraints (35 per cent) rounded out the top four.\n\nMr Gupta, who is also the South Asia vice-chair for SNIA (Storage Networking Industry Association), says that the top security concerns identified across the region are third party application access (49 per cent) and protection of intellectual property (44 per cent). This points to the need for more advanced technology and intelligence-driven models.\n\nThe importance of having continuous availability of data centre resources needs to be understood in the context of the amount of data that is generated globally. Mr Gupta points out that over the past 10 years, the amount of data that we deal with on a daily basis has increased significantly - or by more than 50 times, according to IDC's Digital Universe study.\n\n\"Machine-generated data is a key driver in this growth. Human capital and data are now the most valuable assets for businesses today.\"\n\nEmerging markets are the biggest drivers of the data boom with China and India alone generating 22 per cent of the world's data. By 2020, there will be approximately 5,247 GB of data for every man, woman and child on earth, Mr Gupta adds.\n\nMachine-to-machine communications, also called the Internet of Things (IoT) is playing a central role in driving big data growth. \"This is forcing businesses to move to the third platform (driven by cloud, mobile, big data and social) through cloud-based offerings and applications as a new way of interacting with customers, accessing new markets and gaining greater competitive advantage,\" Mr Gupta says.\n\nIn order to handle the huge amounts of data generated by IoT, a new type of data centre is becoming more common. Called the software-defined data centre (SDDC), it refers to a data centre where all infrastructure is virtualised and delivered as a service.\n\nThe control of SDDCs is automated by software and the hardware configuration becomes less important. This is in contrast to traditional data centres where the infrastructure is typically defined by hardware and devices.\n\nSDDCs are considered to be the next step in data centre evolution as they provide a solution to support both legacy enterprise applications, new cloud computing services and big data requirements.\n\nHowever, the question is: Are companies ready to adopt SDDCs? Another survey by EMC reveals that the biggest inhibitor to technology adoption is that the business culture is not yet ready for big data. \"This is a concern that businesses will need to overcome as Singapore continues its journey as a progressive economy and EMC is committed to working with businesses here on this transformational journey, ensuring that they have the right tools to handle the most essential business priorities successfully,\" says Mr Gupta.\n\nIn the EMC Asia-Pacific survey, respondents cited a lack of senior executive confidence that permeates organisations globally, specifically concerning readiness around the critical IT requirements of continuous availability; advanced security; and integrated backup and recovery.\n\n\"Reduced investment in these critical areas threatens the ability of IT infrastructure to withstand and quickly recover from disruptive incidents such as unplanned downtime, security breaches and data loss. Thus, companies need to ensure that a proper process is in place to continually monitor and address new risks and threats to the enterprise,\" says Mr Gupta.\n\nStudies conducted by EMC shows that big data is giving rise to markedly improved decision-making in Singapore and is having a significant impact on companies' competitive differentiation and ability to avert risk.\n\n\"Around 80 per cent of Singaporean businesses surveyed reported that better uses of big data will lead to better decision-making. Data protection is a key area of concern for Singaporean businesses as they look to adopting progressive strategies to protect their most valuable asset - information.\n\n\"Singapore companies also need to comply with the new Personal Data Protection Act and the Technology Risk Management regulation for the banking and finance sector which were introduced last year,\" Mr Gupta adds.\n\nHe notes that over the past few years the company has developed a number of products that, together with a workload-agnostic protection storage platform as an anchor, provide a secure storage architecture.\n\nEMC recently announced products and services that enable customers to deliver a complete spectrum of data protection and availability capabilities as consumable service. \"Data protection-as-a-service is a key tenant for establishing effective protection for a SDDC. SDDCs form a bedrock that needs to be in place for organisations to confidently transition to a third platform software infrastructure,\" Mr Gupta says.\n\nHe adds that the ability of technology to support businesses comes useful when businesses face increasing data losses. \"Data growth is inevitable. The more data an organisation creates, the greater the potential of data loss and the greater the need for recovery.\"\n\namit@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It did not say how much the acquisition will cost.\n\nThe deal will be completed in two phases, and is subject to regulatory approval, including that of Myanmar Investment Commission.\n\nThe latest development comes two months after Wilmar's acquisition of Indian sugar refiner Shree Renuka Sugars.\n\nShree Renuka has sugar assets in both Brazil and India, the largest sugar producing countries in the world, where production seasons in the first half of the year complement Wilmar's sugar operations in Australia which start producing in the second half.\n\nThe largest integrated palm oil firm in the world, Wilmar moved into the sugar business in 2010 when it bought Australia's largest raw sugar producer Sucrogen. Since then it has also picked up sugar assets in Indonesia and Morocco.\n\nThe sugar business contributed 7.1 per cent to Wilmar's profits before tax in its 2013 financial year.\n\nWilmar's foray into Myanmar's agriculture sector also mirrors that of other firms in recent months.\n\nSingapore-listed Yoma Strategic Holdings said last month that it will form a joint venture with Swiss agri-commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings to plant robusta coffee in the Ayeyarwaddy region.\n\nMyanmar's agriculture sector is one of seven that could increase the size of its economy by more than four times to over US$200 billion in 2030, said McKinsey & Company last year.\n\nThe consultancy forecast a compound annual growth rate of 4 per cent for the sector between 2010 and 2030, and suggested that the sector's current low productivity gives it \"significant room to grow\".\n\nWilmar's shares fell four cents to $3.41 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So, that is a continuing risk,\" said Mr Tharman, who is also Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister.\n\n\"That's not going to be a short-term phenomenon, that's going to be a continuing challenge,\" he stressed at the close of the IMF/World Bank spring meetings in Washington.\n\n\"It's partly reflecting a change in the structure of global finance with larger capital flows, and also a changed composition . . . with a greater share that has been taken by mutual funds and ETFs, often reflecting retail investors at the other end who tend to be more easily jittery.\"\n\nThis translates to more frequent, more sudden reactions to changes in risk perception - exactly what hit emerging economies last year when their growth slowed and interest rates picked up worldwide as the US Federal Reserve began its move away from its crisis-era easy money policy.\n\nThat shift is one of a number of challenges to global growth which the IMF highlighted during the spring meetings, with \"structural reform\" the byword for adjustments needed in the richest to the poorest economies to adapt to the post-crisis world.\n\n\"We are turning the corner. The global economy is faring better,\" said IMF managing director Christine Lagarde in a press conference with Mr Tharman. At the same time, she cautioned: \"It is uneven, it is too slow, it is too fragile.\"\n\nThe IMF has spelled out reforms needed such as balance sheet repairing for indebted corporations and governments, cleaning up and strengthening banking systems - including in Europe - and improving labour markets especially to create jobs for the tens of millions of unemployed youths around the world.\n\nMr Tharman said that, with investment still weak relative to the stage of recovery, countries need to strengthen their legal and operating frameworks to give private investors more confidence.\n\nAt Saturday's press briefing, the IMFC chairman also reiterated his earlier comments made on Friday that he remains positive that the United States will ratify quota reforms by the end of the year.\n\n\"I say this not just because of the technical space within its legislative calendar that makes it possible but also because of the much greater political consensus that we have seen building within Congress on the need for a strong IMF in the face of what are very obvious challenges in the global economy and to the whole global order. So, it is entirely possible that it will be done.\"\n\nOtherwise there will be disruptive change, Mr Tharman warned. \"We are more likely over time to see a weakening of multilateralism, the emergence of regionalism, bilateralism and other ways of dealing with global problems, and that will not be a better world for all of us, for the US, for members of the IMF. It is really a world that will be less safe.\" - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

But the record turnout at the world's biggest watch fair in the Swiss city of Basel may not translate into another year of bumper sales for the Swiss watch industry, virtually the sole supplier of luxury timepieces which are desired in almost every corner of the planet.\n\nFigures recently released by the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry showed that Swiss watch exports rose to a new high of 21.8 billion Swiss francs (S$31 billion) last year, when the turnout at Baselworld 2013 hit a record of 122,000 visitors. But the increase in watch shipments was just 1.9 per cent above the level in 2012, when exports jumped 10.9 per cent over the previous year. This slowdown has partly led to a more cautious mood among buyers at Baselworld 2014, observers say.\n\nWhile there were more visitors this year, it was noticeable that the number of novelties dished out appeared to be fewer than the past year.\n\n\"Market expectations for Baselworld will be prudent this year,\" Citigroup luxury goods analyst Thomas Chauvet was quoted as saying in Financial Times as the fair kicked off. \"The mood is unlikely to be bullish after a disappointing 2013 performance for the Swiss watch industry.\"\n\nConsulting firm Deloitte, which is upbeat about prospects for the Swiss watch industry, said in a study, Time for the Future, that watch executives were \"cautious about the next 12 months\" as customers, in particular the Chinese, had cut back on their spending given the still-shaky global economy.\n\nDespite the bigger turnout, the number of Singapore buyers at Baselworld 2014 seemed smaller this year - and their stay was shorter. At least one major retail chain is said to have trimmed its orders at this year's Baselworld, where up to 80 per cent of global sales of luxury timepieces are sealed.\n\nBut Michael Tay, executive director of The Hour Glass, Singapore's biggest watch retail chain, cautioned against reading too much into the orders. They are \"indicative but not definitive\" of the industry's performance ahead, he pointed out. He added that some of the cutbacks were because many of the brands had yet to deliver 2013 orders.\n\nSales at The Hour Glass were up for the nine months ended December 2013. Though profits were squeezed, the firm is likely to wrap up its financial year ended March 2014 with record sales.\n\nEven so, Mr Tay said that demand for luxury timepieces remained uncertain. \"The outlook is not great, but there's still business to be done. It will be a year of consolidation and rebalancing of sales.\"\n\nSingapore's Swiss watch imports bounced back from a dip in 2012 to post a one per cent increase to 1.14 billion Swiss francs in 2013. However, the Republic's position among Switzerland's top 10 export markets has slipped from seventh to eighth (see table).\n\nShipments to Singapore in the first two months of 2014 fell 3.7 per cent year on year to 163.2 million Swiss francs.\n\nReflecting the mood of caution at Baselworld 2014, a number of brands are thinking of cutting prices this year - a significant change in an industry where price hikes are de rigeur.\n\nSaid Swiss watch brand Zenith's chief executive Jean-Frederic Dufour in Financial Times: \"Lots of watchmakers are pulling prices down a bit to make sure they are competitive. This trend was already there (at Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie or SIHH) in Geneva, and I can imagine that Baselworld will confirm it.\"\n\nObservers say that the prices of complicated timepieces at the show were more down-to-earth than before, with some of the tourbillons priced as low as 80,000 Swiss francs.\n\nEven exhibitors who have not overtly slashed prices juggled their collections towards less-expensive watches.\n\nThere were also fewer glitzy timepieces on display; there was a return to simplicity and more focus on timeless and classical pieces, in part to cater to the preferences of Chinese customers.\n\nMany analysts are still expecting the industry to grow between 6 and 8 per cent this year, roughly in line with the long-term average. Already, Swiss watch exports have jumped 7 per cent in January-March.\n\n\"After a year of consolidation at a very high level, the sector is again showing signs of a marked increase in the value of exports, in line with forecasts,\" said the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry.\n\nShipments to Hong Kong, the biggest market, expanded 5.1 per cent after a 5.6 per cent decline last year. Exports to China, which slid 12.5 per cent last year, inched up 0.6 per cent in the first two months of 2014.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/one-and-two-tier-governance-systems", "site_title": "One and two-tier governance systems", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nOne and two-tier governance systems\n\nIt is unlikely that companies or even other non-profit organisations will follow SMF's move to a two-tier structure, says WILLIE CHENG\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Apr 13, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIN January 2014, the Singapore Manufacturing Federation (SMF) inaugurated a board of governors to sit above a (largely) elected council in order \"to enhance the federation's corporate governance and accountability\".\n\nMore specifically, the role of this board of governors is to \"mediate and resolve issues, in the unlikely though possible event of serious council disagreements, or in the event where there is an unjustifiable draw on the past accumulated reserves of the federation\".\n\nThe SMF's move to a two-tier governance structure took the sector somewhat by surprise because it runs against the preference in Singapore, the US and most Commonwealth countries for a one-tier governance model.\n\nA two-tier or dual board structure is adopted in quite a few other countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and China.\n\nThe German model, ensconced in German corporation law, comprises an executive board (made up entirely of executive directors) and a separate supervisory board (all non-executive directors). The CEO helms the executive board, and a chairman the supervisory board. This prevents not just conflicts of interest but also too much power being concentrated in the hands of one person.\n\nIn contrast, in the one-tier board structure, both executive and non-executive directors sit together on the same board. The risk of an over-concentration of power is usually mitigated by a separation of powers between the CEO and a non-executive chairman, and a sufficient number of independent directors on the board.\n\nThe arguments for a two-tier structure are that the formal separation of non-executive and executive directors achieves a better state of checks-and-balances, and there is less likelihood of an abuse of power.\n\nThe argument against a two-tier structure is that it can be cumbersome for decision-making, especially where organisations have a need to be nimble and react quickly to market forces. Supporters of the one-tier structure also point to studies that have found greater interaction between executive and non-executive board members on important matters of strategy, performance, standards of conduct and communication with stakeholders - all of which ultimately benefit the company.\n\nSMF's new structure does not exactly follow the two-tier German model. As it stands, the members of its governing board and council are all non-executive, with only certain matters being referred to the former.\n\nAlthough the SMF had initially said its move was the first of its kind, there already exist elements of such two-tier governance in Singapore.\n\nMany country clubs, for example, adopt a two-tier governance structure. Typically, a general committee, comprising a president, captain and other committee members, provides oversight of the club's executive management which, in turn, run the day-to-day affairs of the club. In addition, there are often a chairman and deputy chairman (who may be appointed by the land-owner or lessor of the club) who have limited veto powers over material financial and other decisions of the general committee.\n\nA two-tier governance structure can be particularly useful and pertinent in the case of the country clubs. This is because decisions made at annual or extraordinary general meetings are often carried by a very low percentage (often less than 10 per cent) of the membership and is thus not necessarily representative of the will of the majority of members.\n\nAs a result, resolutions on major matters and elections of office bearers can be effectively made by a very small group of members. In such a scenario and with the negative politics seen in some of the clubs, it can be useful to have a chairman and deputy chairman who can objectively assess and veto decisions that could adversely impact the club's long-term interests.\n\nIn SMF's case, there may have been good reasons for a second tier of governance. After all, it has a large council, currently 33 members (with its constitution allowing for a maximum of 38), and an even larger pool of committee members in its eight function committees and 10 industry groups, all of whom are part of the governance layer above the secretariat. More pertinently, SMF has significant reserves of $20 million, an amount that, in its view, calls for more stringent safeguards.\n\nA notable characteristic of the SMF and the country clubs is that they are non-profit organisations without the pressures of bottom-line accountability, speed of market response, and the regulatory regime of commercial, especially listed, companies, for which a one-tier governance system might be more appropriate.\n\nWhile the SMF is to be commended for taking the road less travelled to improve its governance, in my view, it is unlikely that companies or even other non-profit organisations - SID for one - will soon choose to go down the same route.\n\nThe writer is chairman of the Singapore Institute of Directors\n\nFor more articles, go to\n\nbtd.sg/BMatters\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He said that the proposed RTO undervalues Pteris by discounting the airport logistics systems provider's track record and reputation, which allow it to secure tenders from airports around the world.\n\nHe also believes that the RTO overestimates Tianda's value by basing it on \"one year of high profits\" in 2012. Pteris chief executive officer Peter Zheng challenged the claim, stating that Tianda has posted continuous, increasing profits since 2000.\n\nPteris chairman Lim Joo Boon added that an independent financial adviser had already been appointed to give an opinion on the terms of the RTO, and questioned why Mr Tan chose to requisition an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) when he could have raised his concerns at the RTO EGM that had already been planned for Q3 2014.\n\nMr Tan has also accused the board of insufficient efforts to obtain offers from other RTO contenders or find alternatives to raise cash among a \"tremendous\" range of interested parties.\n\nThe board, however, emphasised that an essential benefit of the RTO is the $90 million club deal Tianda's parent company, China International Marine Containers, arranged with three foreign banks.\n\nBesides the RTO, Mr Tan pointed to Pteris's poor financial performance since 2008 as good reason for the removal of directors he proposed.\n\nBut the board members that Mr Tan has taken issue with were only appointed, at the earliest, in 2010 - from which time they have been fighting the fires they inherited, said Mr Lim. The board also pointed out that only two of them were appointed before Mr Tan himself, and questioned how he absolves himself from blame.\n\nMr Tan will address the board's responses tomorrow at a SIAS dialogue with shareholders, who will vote on Mr Tan's proposal to remove the five directors at the April 25 EGM.\n\nPteris's share price closed unchanged yesterday at 13 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Nasdaq Composite, weighted toward the more richly valued technology sector, is a hair's breadth from an official correction, down 8.5 per cent from its April high.\n\nFor some time, traders have evoked the 1990s dotcom era when talking about 2013 \"momentum\" stocks such as electric car maker Tesla Motors, online travel agency Priceline and biotechnology drug maker Intercept Pharmaceuticals. The last time share prices had inflated that fast, the bears warned, it created the stock bubble of 2000.\n\nLast week, those comparisons seemed apt as losses mounted on the \"momentum\" stocks. Intercept, whose shares had risen ten-fold in the space of a year, has lost roughly 40 per cent of its value in less than a month.\n\nMomentum, it turned out, can be a curse as well as a blessing.\n\n\"If you think about where this started, it was a sector rotation at the end of the quarter,\" said Joe Kinahan at TD Ameritrade. \"The selling momentum on these stocks built as people took profits and now they're like 'I just want to be out and rotate my money elsewhere'.\"\n\nThe beneficiaries of the sector rotation are utility and consumer staple stocks. Both these areas had fallen out of favour during the bull run in late 2013, as investors bet rising interest rates would make the dividend-paying sectors less attractive.\n\nRecently, however, interest rates have stopped rising. That's partly because of statements from the Federal Reserve such as in the minutes of the March meeting released last week. In that statement and elsewhere, the central bank has committed itself to keeping rates low even as it retreats from bond buying.\n\nWith the bond market offering little in the way of yields and most stocks \"taken out to the wood shed\", as Mr Kinahan put it, utilities and other high-dividend stocks have come back into fashion.\n\nFor example, the SPDR S&P Utility sector exchange-traded fund has gained roughly 5 per cent since mid-March, in contrast to the SPDR S&P Biotechnology sector exchange-traded fund which has lost about a quarter of its value over the same period.\n\nNow, the question is: \"Are momentum stocks going to continue to maintain their lead, or will that shift over to more defensive and high quality dividend paying stocks, and we'll find that out through earnings season,\" said Oliver Pursche at Gary Goldberg Financial Services.\n\nReports last week seemed to confirm the change in leadership. High-flying data-security concern Imperva warned that its growth was slowing, sending its shares down by more than 40 per cent.\n\nJPMorgan Chase warned that the go-go days of Fed-supported bond trading were \"tapering\" off alongside the central bank's market activity. General Motors, one of the strongest consumer stocks in recent months, was beset once more by mechanical and sales worries after a recall scandal.\n\nThe only glimmers of hope were the not-as-bad-as feared report from Alcoa and the surprisingly strong report from Wells Fargo, a bank more oriented toward consumer and commercial lending than Wall Street trading.\n\nThis week, a wide range of earnings reports will reveal whether the stock market's shift to a defensive crouch is lasting. If the \"momentum\" areas of the stock market are to regain the upper hand, they'll need a strong showing from industrial conglomerates such as General Electric, banks such as Citigroup and tech giants such as Intel.\n\nBulls argue that the first-quarter reports will positively surprise a market that's overestimated the damage a severe winter and tapering have done to corporate growth.\n\nAu contraire, say the bears, the market had overestimated the potential for corporate growth in the first place.\n\n\"We believe that this slow motion deterioration and narrowing of the rally will continue, and the next six months will be more volatile,\" said Lorenzo Di Mattia of hedge fund Sibilla Global Fund.\n\nThere are also plenty of bearish indicators on charts: the S&P 500 has broken below levels where buyers had emerged in the past; this time of year is traditionally unkind to stocks; and three years is an unusually long period of time without a 10 per cent correction.\n\nUnless the earnings reports exceed growth targets this week, the stock market's streak may soon end.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The expansion includes a second synthetic rubber production line here, as well as an adhesive materials plant - with the latter a forerunner of a major C5 petrochemicals investment plan the company has for Singapore.\n\n\"Singapore is set to become one of the most important business footholds in the group's global business strategy,\" said Zeon Corporation president Kimiaki Tanaka at the opening of its solution styrene-butadiene rubber (S-SBR) plant here. \"We are planning to set up the second S-SBR production line in the near future, followed by the potential C5-related production.\"\n\nElaborating, Zeon Chemicals' Singapore MD, Yuki Hirakawa, told BT that the group expects to make the final investment decision (FID) for the second S-SBR plant here around June this year, with construction of the $100 million facility slated for this year-end to enable commercial production to begin in April, 2016. This will double its S-SBR capacity here to 60,000-80,000 tonnes per annum (tpa).\n\n\"The additional capacity in Singapore is a must, to ensure stable supply for customers,\" he said. \"While demand for S-SBR was relatively soft last year, it's picking up again.\"\n\nS-SBR is a raw material used to make fuel-efficient tyres. And like its Japanese rivals, Sumitomo Chemical and Asahi Kasei Chemicals, which have also set up S-SBR plants here, all the plants here supply to global markets such as the US, Europe and Asia. Other synthetic rubber investors here, albeit for butyl/halobutyl rubber facilities, include Germany's Lanxess and US energy giant ExxonMobil.\n\nOn Zeon's mega C5 downstream plan here - said to amount to as much as $1 billion - Mr Hirakawa said that discussions are still ongoing with a petrochemicals player here on C5 feedstock supply.\n\nBut in the interim, as part of its overall C5 plan, Zeon is now considering proceeding with a 30,000 tpa styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS) plant estimated to cost about $350 million, to produce materials used in adhesives. It will however, need to import isoprene for this.\n\nThe centrepiece of its C5 production plan for Singapore is a Geon Process Isoprene plant, estimated to cost some $650 million, with the facility making use of C5 feedstock to produce 60,000-80,000 tpa of isoprene monomer needed for its SIS plant. But the timing for this GPI investment will hinge on its C5 feedstock discussions, said Mr Hirakawa.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Finances were tight. The group was also involved in a legal situation with an ex-employee claiming $2 million from the firm.\n\n\"There were structural issues, personnel issues. Doctors were in the process of leaving left, right and centre,\" Dr Beng told The Business Times in an interview.\n\nSMG had initially been pursued by Q&M Dental Group, which in Dec 2012 launched a $22.7 million takeover bid, offering 13.23 cents for each SMG share - a 41 per cent premium over its share price of 9.4 cents.\n\nBut in May last year, the dental group pulled out from the deal, citing as a reason a material change in SMG's financial performance.\n\n\"From a morale standpoint, from December when it was announced till May when it broke, there was basically a period of inactivity (in SMG),\" said Dr Beng. \"No one could drive any growth; no one could drive any direction. There was a tremendous amount of uncertainty.\"\n\n\"If you're a smart person - and doctors are very very smart people - they will wonder is this where I want to be? There has to be stability, there has to be confidence.\"\n\nTwo weeks after Q&M terminated the agreement, Dr Beng - a doctor by training who decided to venture into business after five years of practice - acquired 20.4 per cent of the group.\n\nThen, in October, Parkway Holdings founder Tony Tan Choon Keat and CordLife Group co-founder Ho Choon Hou - acting in concert with Dr Beng - bought a 42.2 per cent stake in the group from previous controlling shareholders Cheryl Baumann and her husband Felix Huang Keming for 11.44 cents a share.\n\nThe change in ownership triggered a breach in SMG's banking covenant with RHB Bank, and also the right for private equity fund Kendall Court to require SMG to redeem its 25.5 million redeemable convertible preference shares.\n\nIf the latter were to take place, SMG's current net tangible assets would fall below that required in a banking covenant with Maybank, causing another breach.\n\nThese added to the already-precarious financial situation for the firm.\n\n\"Literally we were living hand to mouth. We weren't sure at months whether we could pay things off,\" said Dr Beng, formerly a managing director for Hewlett-Packard in Thailand. He had to extend a $500,000 loan to the firm in November to shore up its finances.\n\nSubsequently, in late December, SMG announced a rights issue, raising $7.4 million in net proceeds.\n\nComfortable\n\nThe funds raised have enabled SMG to pay off Kendall Court. While the firm is still in discussions with RHB and Maybank over the breach of its banking covenants, they are \"extremely comfortable\" with SMG's current financial position, he said.\n\n\"For the first time I can actually sit back and breathe,\" Dr Beng said as he chuckled. \"From a cash standpoint, we've got more than enough for our needs this year, not just day-to day-operations, but also to fund the various growth initiatives that we're targetting.\"\n\nMorale has gone up significantly, evident in a drop in the turnover of its staff. The legal battles with its former employee have also been resolved.\n\n\"We've systematically gone down the list to take away every single potential risk to the business.... it's really around making sure that the legacy issues don't surface ever again,\" he said.\n\nThe fact that SMG has managed to narrow its loss in the second half of last year bears witness to this turnaround, he added.\n\nExcluding one-off impairment charges made as a result of the restructuring work, SMG was in the red by $0.5 million in the second half of last year, as compared to a loss of $1.7 million in the first half.\n\n\"We've stablilised the ship, and now we're talking about growth,\" said Dr Beng.\n\nHe is bullish about the prospects for the healthcare sector. \"Medical tourism into Singapore is growing fairly robustly. We see anything from 500,000 to 600,000 patients coming (annually) from overseas into the Singapore market.\"\n\nWhile the public medical sector is very succesful, it is also facing its own challenges, such as a hospital bed crunch and long waiting times for patients. At the same time, ongoing investments by major players usch as Parkway Holdings and Raffles Medical Group are \"clear indications that they believe the market will continue to grow,\" he said.\n\n\"We believe that there is such a growth market that there are opportunities for smaller players like ourselves as well.\"\n\nThe new head honcho already has his plans all drawn up.\n\nRecognising that patients go for brand-name doctors in the private medical sector, SMG intends to add a few doctors over six months.\n\n\"We're in the process of establishing an organisation that attracts the very best doctors that we can find in Singapore, and I'm personally very involved in the process,\" said Dr Beng.\n\nHis father Jimmy Beng, an established urologist, has been called out of semi-retirement to support the endeavour. He started practising at the SMG Urologist Centre on April 1.\n\n\"Clearly he's got a strong contact base and a strong network of doctors, which he is going to bring into the SMG fold.\"\n\nAnd while SMG's eye segment used to be its core business, contributing as much as 99 per cent of its revenue in 2006, SMG - which owns the Lasik Surgery Clinic at Paragon - will now invest more in other areas such as oncology, women and children, aesthetics, dental, sports medicine and orthopaedics.\n\nShrinking\n\nThe Lasik market has been shrinking, he explained, though markets within opthamology such as eye diseases and cataracts continue to grow. The business made up 21 per cent of its revenue last year.\n\nAnother area of expansion will be in regional markets. \"We're seeing two to three times year-on-year growth in the number of patients from the Vietnamese, Russian and Cambodian markets,\" said Dr Beng.\n\nSingapore is famous in the region for providing quality care, he added. \"While we are still recognised and famous, we need to take our brands, our technology out into those market places.\"\n\nThe group has signed an agreement with Ciputra Group, one of Indonesia's largest property developers, to start an eye clinic in Jakarta. Both are now in the process of finalising the joint venture, with the centre probably starting in September or October, said Dr Beng.\n\n\"The key thing is finding the right partner. We have the right partner in Indonesia, and we're looking for the right partners in Malaysia, and the regional neighbouring countries. We'll take more and more of our verticals out there.\"\n\nMore tie-ups are in the works, especially as SMG's chairman Tony Tan - the founder of Parkway Holdings, the largest healthcare provider in Southeast Asia - is actively involved in the business.\n\n\"He's got a tremendous network, which is being leveraged in a variety of contexts today,\" said Dr Beng, who interacts with him \"almost every other day\".\n\nThe other major shareholder, Mr Ho Choon Hou, is more a passive investor, but Dr Beng does not rule out a potential partnership between SMG and Cordlife when opportunities arise.\n\nAlready, SMG's share price has climbed 40 per cent this year, ending at 15.7 cents on Friday, compared to the 1.1 per cent increase in the Straits Times Index benchmark. But Dr Beng has his sights set on much more.\n\n\"Do I want to be in a larger business than where we are today? The answer is absolutely. I want to be a lot bigger (than our current $30 million plus market capitalisation),\" he said.\n\n\"We've got a stable ship. It's a ship that's cleaned up, that's free from debt, that's free from all legal battle. And it's a ship we're looking forward to growing significantly.\"\n\nsandrea@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Net property income rose 14.7 per cent to $39.5 million.\n\nThe commercial Reit said yesterday that this was due to improved performances from Ocean Financial Centre and Prudential Tower, as well as the additional income from 8 Exhibition Street in Melbourne, in which it acquired a 50-per-cent stake in last August.\n\nA better performing Marina Bay Financial Centre Phase One - which comprises the office towers 1 and 2 as well as Marina Bay Link Mall - also helped Keppel Reit's share of results of associates climb 12.6 per cent to $16 million.\n\nThe Reit owns a one-third interest in Marina Bay Financial Centre Phase One through a stake in BFC Development.\n\nIn addition, it said it had achieved 100 per cent and 99.8 per cent committed occupancies for its Singapore portfolio and overall portfolio respectively. Its recently completed premium office building in Sydney, 8 Chifley Square, also reported a higher committed occupancy of 97 per cent, with the signing of Natixis Global Asset Management during the quarter.\n\nThe Reit noted that in the last quarter of 2013, office tenants in Sydney and Melbourne continued to consolidate their operations and relocate to the central business district (CBD), while the office market in Brisbane was supported by limited new supply and a bottoming out of new sub-lease space. Leasing activity for smaller spaces in Brisbane's and Perth's CBDs also increased in Q4 last year.\n\n\"The outlook for the group's Australian properties is expected to be stable, given the long weighted average lease expiry of the properties, almost fully committed occupancy levels as well as the fixed annual rental escalations,\" it said.\n\nYesterday, another Keppel subsidiary, K-Green Trust, posted a 9.4 per cent increase in profit for its first quarter ended March 31, 2014, to $3.5 million. This translated into earnings per unit of 0.56 cent, up from 0.51 cent a year ago.\n\nThis was partly due to lower electricity costs, which fell 16.4 per cent to $1.6 million after measures were taken to mitigate their volatility by fixing the price. Savings from the solar photovoltaic system, which generates electricity for plant consumption, also helped.\n\nThe business trust's revenue dipped 1.3 per cent to $16.8 million in the quarter.\n\nThe trust, which has an investment focus on green infrastructure assets, said it expected the performance of its three assets to remain stable, thanks to their long-term concession agreements with Singapore statutory bodies, National Environment Agency and PUB.\n\nIt said: \"Senoko Trust and Tuas DBOO Trust derive most of their income from capacity payments, which offer a stable source of income with little correlation to economic or demographic fluctuations.\n\n\"Ulu Pandan Trust's income is derived in equal parts from availability payments and from NEWater output payments. Demand for NEWater is subject to demand from PUB.\"\n\nThe trust recently announced its intention to expand its investment mandate to cover a wider range of infrastructure assets, and change its name to Keppel Infrastructure Trust.\n\nKeppel Reit ended one cent higher at $1.17, while K-Green Trust closed half a cent higher at $1.045.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The company has appointed Rippledot Capital Advisers as its financial adviser, and its founder David Lam - who owns 32 per cent of the firm - is said to be open towards a takeover offer.\n\nSeveral banks are involved in financing a deal for Goodpack, sources told BT.\n\nThe counter has run up 26 per cent since early March to touch an all-time high of $2.33 on April 4. The counter, which ended at $2.23 on Friday, is now trading at a price-earnings ratio of 18.9 - above its five-year historical average of 15 times earnings.\n\nThe latest round of speculation over possible takeover bids is not new; Goodpack has, over the years, attracted various suitors.\n\nIn 2008, it had hired Macquarie to look at strategic alternatives - from a sale to a strategic buyer to bringing in new investors. At that time, Australian packing companies Loscam and Brambles were reported to be interested in bidding for the firm.\n\nBrambles, which leases wooden pallets, reusable plastic containers and IBCs to the fast-moving consumer goods industry, said on March 20 that while it has engaged in preliminary discussions with Goodpack on several previous occasions, including in the recent past, these did not pro-gress.\n\nNonetheless, its statement that it is \"not currently in active discussions with Goodpack,\" and that it \"will continue to monitor the situation\" has led some to speculate that Brambles has not ruled out the option completely either.\n\nAnalysts attribute Goodpack's appeal to its strong position in a market niche and its global network which makes for a wide economic moat.\n\nGoodpack rents reusable IBCs to tyre manufacturers, chemical and juice producers such as Michelin, Bridgestone, BASF, Campbell and Heinz, for use in transporting their products, replacing the traditional wooden boxes and metal drums used in these industries.\n\nBesides being environmentally-friendly, Goodpack's solutions provide cost savings of about 20 per cent to clients, said Ho Pei Hwa of DBS.\n\nOn top of that, Goodpack has 15 more years to its design patent for the IBC. Coupled with the stickiness of its current clients, and the estimated US$900 million needed in capital expenditure for another player to match Goodpack's fleet size, there are significant barriers to others entering the industry, pointed out OCBC analyst Yap Kim Leng.\n\nThe firm was founded in 1989, when Mr Lam, who was a rubber trader then, saw the need to solve a packaging problem that plagued natural rubber buyers - splinters, sawdust and other debris from wooden crates used to package natural rubber bales were contaminating the commodity.\n\n\"So I thought we should look at something that is easy to pack, environmentally friendly, easy to stack and cheaper than the wood we were buying,\" Mr Lam, now Goodpack's chairman, told The Straits Times in an interview last year.\n\nGoodpack has already made a mark for itself in the natural and synthetic rubber markets, holding about 40 per cent and 32 per cent of the respective market share.\n\nIt is expecting the synthetic rubber business to remain a key growth driver over the next three years, as it sees a healthy pipeline of synthetic rubber plants globally.\n\nMeanwhile, Goodpack has also been making a big push into the automotive parts industry in recent years. It already has over 20 contracts from autopart customers. The firm is also receiving more enquiries and trials.\n\nThe addressable market size in autoparts is more than 10 times the natural rubber and synthetic rubber businesses combined, explained CIMB analyst Jessalynn Chen. \"If they can break into this business, it will allow them to grow a lot faster.\"\n\nA takeover by global private equity operators such as Blackstone - which have strong connections to auto part manufacturers - could also help Goodpack break into the market, she added.\n\nAuto parts manufacturers who are currently trying out Goodpack's system and potentially switching over to it before the second quarter of the next financial year could provide a major upside surprise for the firm, said Mr Yap of OCBC.\n\nAt the same time, the turnaround of the US and European economies looks set to benefit the firm, which had 45 per cent of its revenue from these regions in 2013, he added.\n\nAmong the six analysts covering the stocks, three have a \"buy\" call, while the rest have a \"neutral\" call.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They'll be able to see who's editing a file and exchange messages with other editors, while keeping all the different versions in sync.\n\nThis will be available within applications like Microsoft Word, so that users get to stay within the environments in which they're familiar, while using Dropbox as the glue between them.\n\nDropbox is trying to wedge itself into the corporate space among stalwarts that have established footholds with enterprises. Microsoft and Google, for example, have offered cloud storage behind their office apps for years.\n\nEnterprises are typically more squeamish about moving their data beyond their four walls and into the hands of a third party.\n\nFrost & Sullivan ICT analyst Treepti Jaswal said that the majority of enterprises in the Asia-Pacific still shy away from using third party cloud storage. \"Security is an obvious (issue), as IT departments are concerned about the sensitivity of their data, especially in more conservative countries such as Japan and Korea,\" she noted.\n\nDropbox faces an uphill battle in convincing more corporate users that it's safe.\n\nSecurity software vendor Symantec, for example, has instructions on how companies can block Dropbox.\n\nDropbox's main contender as a standalone cloud storage, Box, has been quicker to address the security piece for enterprises. It has partnerships with enterprise-facing players like Good Technology and MobileIron to offer services such as remote wiping of data, in the event of devices getting lost.\n\nBut Dropbox's place in the enterprise might be hard for corporate IT departments to ignore. According to a recent Ponemon study, 60 per cent of US organisations have employees who frequently or very frequently put confidential files on public clouds like Dropbox without permission. These users also said that corporate controls have been fairly ineffective at restricting their usage of these services.\n\nDriven by its popularity with consumers, Dropbox's new features could provide an extra edge in winning the \"official\" IT departments' stamp of approval.\n\nDespite an almost two-year headstart to the market over Dropbox, Box has about 20 million users, according to recent reports.\n\nSix-year-old Dropbox, on the other hand, has 275 million users, thanks in part to its consumer roots. On its part, Dropbox has been vocal about rearchitecting its backend to support the new security needed to offer dual accounts to users.\n\nOne is controlled by the user, while the IT department still has control over the corporate account. When the user leaves the company, he loses access to corporate files, and companies can also remotely wipe the files off their personal devices connected to Dropbox.\n\nAllowing this involved rebuilding Dropbox for businesses, the company said recently.\n\nThis builds on an administration tool that Dropbox launched last year, which allowed corporate IT departments to set policies for enterprise accounts.\n\nMs Jaswal said that users are getting increasingly comfortable with cloud storage, which will help enterprises warm to online storage in the long run. Furthermore, cost pressures could provide an extra push for some enterprises to get on the cloud, the analyst added.\n\n\"There has been stiff competition from Microsoft Skydrive, Box and Google Drive, especially on particular attributes such as business offerings and competitive price points,\" she said.\n\nAccording to a Businessweek report from last week, Dropbox has 70,000 corporate users. In comparison, Box said in the third quarter of 2013 that it counted 180,000 businesses clients.\n\nDropbox's corporate push is also set against the backdrop of rumours of an impending IPO. Corporate accounts provide better revenue yield compared with consumers, which should help draw more profit for the company.\n\nIf anything, Dropbox's backers certainly believe in its prospects. Last year, it declared a massive US$350 million round of funding that valued Dropbox at US$10 billion. In 2011, it raised US$250 million, at a valuation of US$4 billion.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/technology/axelos-eyes-asia-international-expansion-itil", "site_title": "Axelos eyes Asia for international expansion of Itil", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nAxelos eyes Asia for international expansion of Itil\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Apr 13, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nAXELOS, the new guardian of management and best practices frameworks Itil (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) and Prince2, is planting roots in Asia as it begins its drive to expand the frameworks' adoption more aggressively beyond Europe.\n\nBoth Prince2 (Projects in Controlled Environments, version 2) and Itil were created by the UK government in the late 1980s, and have been updated over the years. Prince2 is a project management methodology while Itil is a set of practices for IT service management (ITSM) that focuses on aligning IT services with the needs of business.\n\nLast year, the UK government decided to tender for a joint venture to be set up with a private company for the assets of Itil and Prince2.\n\nBusiness outsourcing firm Capita won the tender, which gave it 51 per cent of the resultant joint venture Axelos, with the government retaining its share of the rest. Axelos took over the ownership of the intellectual property and administration of the professional accreditation process.\n\nAxelos CEO Peter Hepworth said Itil has two million people certified worldwide. With the mandate to grow the certification's spread globally, Asia's emerging markets are next in Axelos' cross hairs.\n\nHe was speaking to BizIT during a visit to Singapore, where he met business leaders to find out what they wanted from the best practices frameworks.\n\n\"Singapore is one of our main markets in reaching out to the region. There remains a lot to do to localise the (framework) content and make it culturally sensitive,\" he said.\n\nPart of this work will involve adapting the teachings from case studies, to training material, he said.\n\nSingapore's melting pot of cultures and expat community within its landscape of multinational corporations make it particularly interesting to Axelos as a testing ground for the frameworks. Findings from case studies here will go towards executing the best practices in neighbouring countries, as well as larger Asian neighbours such as China, where there lies growing opportunity across the maturing corporate landscape.\n\n\"We are a global business so we will go to the growing world. Singapore is the centre of that, here,\" he said.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of Itil users continues to be in the UK. Based on 2011's book sales, the UK was responsible for 41 per cent of Itil sales, with the United States as next closest market at 20 per cent. Australia, Germany and Canada contributed 7 per cent, 9 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively.\n\nWith the aim to expand Itil globally, Mr Hepworth is chasing a goal to produce a profit for the UK taxpayer to the tune of \u00a3500 million (S$1 billion) over the next 10 years, according to the UK government's announcement upon spinning of Axelos.\n\nThrough exploiting new markets, the aim is to triple revenues in the next 10 years for the best practices frameworks.\n\nCapita paid \u00a310 million up front and will pay a further \u00a39.4 million per year for the next three years to the British government for the formation of Axelos.\n\nThe growth target sounds ambitious, but Mr Hepworth's job may be cut out for him. He pointed out that the frameworks have strong case studies behind them, and it's a matter of translating the application of them to Asian businesses.\n\nMSP (Managing Successful Programmes), another of Axelos' trademark best practices frameworks, was used to deliver the London Olympics, he said. And the United Nations uses Prince2 to track and manage aid and ensure that it is used properly.\n\n\"Many of the lessons are not as affected by culture. It's more determined by the size of the organisation and how effective the training is,\" he said.\n\nAnd Itil continues to grow in relevance for businesses because of how much businesses rely on the IT function. \"This trend keeps increasing, as well,\" he said.\n\nPrior to his appointment as CEO, Mr Hepworth was the head honcho for the UK at large video games publisher, Activision. Before that, he was at large corporations such as L'Oreal and Sara Lee.\n\nHe said the challenges across industries tend to be similar once companies hit a certain size.\n\n\"L'Oreal, for example, is highly structured during its marketing launches. They all seem very creative and glossy, but they are well-managed not to go over budget, and they maintain quality. Behind the gloss and 'cool', the best campaigns are just well-structured,\" he said.\n\nAt the beginning of Itil adoption, most companies just want to make sure their service desks are centralised and managed more efficiently. As the top-level embraces the framework more, they tend to try to marry the service function with IT as a strategy, he explained.\n\nAnd with IT use becoming more important to business functions, there has been more specialised adoption of Itil's teachings in non-IT departments, such as human resources, he said. \"We're starting to examine whether we should branch out to writing a best practices framework for HR service management. Itil has gone beyond IT, for sure.\"\n\nSince Mr Hepworth was employee Number One at Axelos last July, the organisation is 50-strong now, and he plans to make a stronger push on social media, to reach out to new organisations.\n\nPrior to Axelos, there was no social media outreach for the certifications. \"There was no focus to market and advertise, because that was left to channel partners,\" he said.\n\nNow, Axelos has set up dedicated sales and marketing functions, with the aim of communicating the various certifications together with current concerns.\n\nCybersecurity, for example, is one of the hot button topics that companies are concerned with - that he claims Itil's different frameworks can help address.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It hit an intra-day high of 3.2 cents.\n\nIn a release to the Singapore Exchange on Thursday night, Cacola said that under a conditional sale and purchase agreement with investment holding firm Sharp Year Ventures, it is looking to acquire a group which will be incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Cacola was introduced to Sharp Year by an independent third party, Torch Consultants Group.\n\nThe companies under the group to be acquired are controlled by Philippine citizen He Liangping, through Goyes Investment Holdings Group. After a restructuring exercise, Sharp Year - which is owned by Mr He - will be the sole shareholder of the target group.\n\nThe businesses in the target group focus on three sectors - livestock breeding, meat processing and related trading, tourism as well as property development. The combined post-tax profit of the target group's principal subsidiaries was about 110 million yuan (S$22.1 million) for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2013.\n\n\"The company is proposing to undertake the proposed acquisition, pursuant to which the target group with a profitable track record will be injected into the company,\" said Cacola. \"The proposed acquisition is expected to give the company a new lease of life and support the company's application for the removal from the watch-list.\"\n\nIn addition, it could help boost its market capitalisation which could in turn widen its investor base and lead to greater interest from investors, Cacola said.\n\nCacola was placed on the watch-list on March 5 after it recorded pre-tax losses for the three consecutive financial years.\n\nCacola will pay Sharp Year a maximum of 1.32 billion yuan, of which 250 million yuan will be paid in cash and 1.07 billion yuan will be paid through new Cacola shares.\n\nTo fund the cash portion, Cacola plans to carry out fund raising activities - through the issuance of equity-linked notes or otherwise - with details to be announced later.\n\nCacola also plans to conduct a share consolidation of 60 shares into one consolidated share.\n\nAfter the acquisition, Sharp Year will hold 70 per cent of the enlarged share capital of Cacola. As this is above the 30 per cent threshold which will trigger a general offer under the Singapore Code on Takeovers and Mergers, Sharp Year intends to apply for a whitewash waiver so that it won't have to make such an offer.\n\nAn extraordinary general meeting will be called for shareholders to vote on the proposed deal.\n\nIn a separate announcement, Cacola said it has terminated all negotiations and discussions on two deals proposed earlier for the acquisition of gold mines in Guizhou and Hubei, in China. The long-stop dates to execute the agreements under both MOUs lapsed last year and Cacola will no longer pursue the transactions under those MOUs.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

What can be done to raise the levels of service excellence and customer satisfaction?\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Apr 13, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nAndrew J Calvert\n\nRegional Operations Director\n\nSales and Solutions\n\nAchieveGlobal\n\nSERVICE in Singapore is inconsistent. There are pockets of excellence and pockets of, well, mediocrity.\n\nTo raise standards, as business owners and leaders we need to lead from the front. Really, ask yourself, how often do you engage your customers, listen to them and then share that information with your staff? How about listening to your staff - and asking what processes or systems are causing problems that impact the customer experience? Work with them to list those issues that occur most frequently, and ask how you and your employees can ''fix'' the issues to improve the customer experience? Don't forget to do it! Finally, we need to educate our teams about why service is important. It costs five times more to acquire one new customer than to keep an existing one. Dissatisfied customers tell 10 to 16 people about a negative experience (and that's not counting Facebook, Stomp, Blogs, Twitter, etc).\n\nSuhaimi Salleh\n\nCEO\n\nSSA Consulting Group Pte Ltd\n\nI'D say service standards in Singapore are acceptable but not fantastic. A lot more can be done to improve on service and sometimes, it all boils down to training those in the frontline. I was in the United States for vacation recently and one thing I noticed was that the frontline service staff there make the effort to exchange pleasantries, be it the busy Starbucks barista or the supermarket cashier. At the very least they would ask, ''How are you today?'' One waitress at a little brunch joint in Palm Springs even went the extra mile to search for brochures for a nearby attraction just because I casually asked a question about it. In the midst of the hustle and bustle of conducting business or doing our job, it's easy to treat the person you're serving as just another customer or another account on your sales sheet. And it doesn't take much to avoid being too cordial or unfriendly. A smile and some general but sincere pleasantries are all it takes to break the ice. It may be that pragmatism and lack of warmth are Asian traits or that the overwhelming number of foreigners working in the service and healthcare industries lead to communication issues. But this is where training can come in handy. And it's high time employers take service training seriously, especially when there's US$16 billion at play.\n\nVenkatraman Sheshashayee\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nJaya Holdings Ltd\n\nTHERE are three aspects of service - the platform/philosophy, the policies and processes and the people. In Singapore, I believe that the government scores very well on all these aspects. I have never experienced a shortfall in any interaction with any government department.\n\nAlso, I have always had the most pleasant experiences with the people aspect of service, in every nook and cranny - be it in taxis, hotels, hospitals, shops, banks, restaurants, etc. Singaporeans are, in my view, truly service-oriented and go out of their way to help customers and clients.\n\nWhere I have encountered gaps (few and far between) is in the ''policies and processes'' aspect of service. In some organisations, either these are inadequately formed, or they are improperly communicated, leading to situations where frontline staff are unable to make quick decisions, which would resolve the problem cost effectively and leave the customer delighted.\n\nI believe we need to enhance the quality of our policies and processes, leading to increased empowerment of our frontline staff. We also need to invest more in communicating these policies and processes across our organisations, and reiterating the organisation's philosophy continuously so that there are no disconnects through the value chain.\n\nFinally, I believe that it will help Singapore to have a robust customer protection platform (more than what we have today in the form of Case). An empowered and active platform will serve to reassure customers as well as help service providers strive harder.\n\nPatrick Liew\n\nManaging Partner\n\nGlobal Enterprise Exchange\n\nAS the world becomes a networked village, there are three mega-shifts that should warrant your attention and response:\n\n1. Customer service begins before the first contact. Before the first contact, your customers may check you out online and through other sources, especially from people who know you and have worked with you. If your customers are not impressed, it will be harder to develop a healthy and sustainable relationship.\n\n2. Serve the customer's total needs and not just the professional needs. In a networked village, you cannot show interest in one area of the customers' life. You need to meet customer's immediate and evolving needs and, at the same time, exceed their expectations with an edge over the competitors.\n\n3. Provide ahead-of-the-curve and on-demand services.\n\nCustomers in a networked village may not know what they want. They can also be wrong about their real needs. In a fast-changing landscape, they may not be able to keep track of advancements and progress. There may be better solutions and services that they are not aware of. Think - what are tomorrow's service challenges you need to resolve today? What are tomorrow's service opportunities that you can capitalise on today?\n\nToh Han Li\n\nChief Executive\n\nCompetition Commission of Singapore\n\nTHE ability of customers to switch service providers freely is a critical facet of a market economy. That is what drives business to improve their service standards and be more responsive to customer needs. Competition law strives to ensure that innovative and efficient businesses who are able to offer customers better services are not unduly impeded by incumbents. Instead of improving their service quality, the incumbents could seek to collectively boycott better competitors to drive them out or put in place exclusive arrangements resulting in many captive customers, immunisation from competition and potentially bad service delivery. Information transparency in the market place should also be encouraged so as to empower customers to compare service standards and make better informed choices, and ultimately drive businesses to deliver higher service standards in Singapore.\n\nChris Comer\n\nCEO and Property Developer\n\nCastlewood Group\n\nTHE level of service standards can be as varied as the people providing them. Singapore companies deal with an extremely cosmopolitan mix of clientele, from almost every country of Asia as well as every continent. Client expectations vary according to their own geo-socio-economic background, and that same background will vary the levels of good manners extended to those providing the service. We need to break racial stereotyping beliefs held by customers and staff. You should not pre-judge that a person from a specific country will behave in a certain way. You should not judge a book by its cover. If the standard operating procedure is to behave in a certain way to a customer, that must be extended to every customer, regardless of their dress, ethnicity, manners and mannerisms. Companies need to be genuinely motivated to raise their game in service standards in Singapore. Mystery shopping is a major help and then ultimately it's down to training.\n\nFlorence Ng\n\nManaging Director, Founder\n\nStraits Talent Pte Ltd\n\nMEDIOCRE. This sums up my view of service standards in Singapore across all sectors. Leading the pack in mediocrity are the retail, F&B, finance and postal service sectors. A common recurring theme is the lack of interest, or motivation, to think outside of the proverbial box. There is a strong tendency for frontline staff (including hotline customer service officers) to hide behind policies, regulations and past precedence. They usually do not listen very well, appear to be reading from a script and are reluctant to seek to understand the customer. Clearly, this hampers their ability to deliver customer satisfaction. Passion and personal pride in their work is quite often lacking. Whether all this mediocre service is attributable to wage structure, lack of training or job motivation is debatable. What is not debatable is that any change needs to be initiated and supported by managers up the line.\n\nSeah Kian Peng\n\nCEO (Singapore)\n\nNTUC Fairprice Co-operative Ltd\n\nSERVICE standards in Singapore have a long way to go to meet international standards. The same goes for NTUC FairPrice. As a customer-centric organisation, we take a proactive approach towards service excellence. Providing good service is an ongoing journey that requires effort and commitment by management and staff. The organisation's service philosophy must be clearly articulated to forge a common understanding and expectation towards good service. For example, FairPrice's service motto is ''Service from the HEART''. Our staff regularly renew our commitment to service and recite our service pledge before we open our stores for business each day. FairPrice also equips staff with the necessary service skills and knowledge to enhance the positive shopping experience for customers. To motivate service staff and celebrate service champions, recognition and awards ceremonies are organised to affirm all service efforts. Our commitment to Service Excellence has helped us achieve the highest ratings for Customer Satisfaction in the supermarket sub-sector of the CSISG for the past two years and our Service Class certification has been extended again this year.\n\nJohnny Lu\n\nManaging Director, Asia Pacific\n\nGMC Software Technology\n\nGOOD Customer Communication Management (CCM) is a critical component of an outstanding customer experience. Today, customers want to interact with brands how, where and when they want, through print, online or via a mobile device, as they wish. Our experience in Asia has shown us that businesses which emphasise personalised service on a consistent basis will likely see higher levels of customer satisfaction, and Singapore is no different.\n\nExcellent customer service and high levels of customer satisfaction are two sides of the same coin. Brands have to deliver clear, consistent and relevant personalised communications with the same look-and-feel across multiple channels to build brand recognition and customer loyalty that lasts, while keeping costs down and reaching out to new markets and customers. It all boils down to delivering what customers want, when they want it and in the ways they want it, as quickly and reliably as possible.\n\nIngrid Sidiadinoto\n\nManaging Director\n\nUPS Singapore\n\nTHE Singapore government has done a good job in championing national initiatives to promote a culture of service excellence today. This, in turn, builds long-term relationships, extends customer loyalty and trust which helps companies cultivate repeat business. To raise service quality, it is imperative to provide differentiated products and segment-specific solutions to customers across fast-growing healthcare, high-technology and retail industries today.\n\nHelping customers navigate the e-commerce landscape effectively through logistics is also crucial in creating customer loyalty. From market intelligence, faster deliveries, flexible delivery options to hassle-free returns, UPS creates a better overall experience for our customers by focusing on critical differentiators of the online shopping customer experience. Analysis of shopping habits, brand preference, retailer recommendations in our recent ''Pulse of the Shopper'' survey helps businesses raise customer satisfaction standards to capture a larger share of the thriving e-commerce market.\n\nChristophe Duchatellier\n\nCEO\n\nAdecco Asia\n\nSERVICE standards here in Singapore are among the best in the world. The service industry everywhere is no stranger to long hours and tough challenges from discerning customers. To be an outstanding service provider, we have to look beyond service excellence and customer satisfaction. It has to be seen as a long-term partnership, a commitment and not merely a transaction. People relate to and resonate with genuine heartfelt service and, in this increasingly competitive and dynamic marketplace, sadly, organisations have lost some of that personal touch which makes the difference between good and great service. Regardless of the industry, there has to be genuine and sincere dealings and this has to start with senior leaders of organisations. Apart from training and education, the importance of customer satisfaction should be part of the culture and norm of every organisation and not just a nice-to-have but a motto that employees, leaders and managers live by. Companies which practise and value these will see the change that will translate to both happy customers and a healthy balance sheet.\n\nFrancis Fong\n\nManaging Director\n\nSAS Institute Pte Ltd, Singapore\n\nSINGAPORE has always had a reputation for efficient and courteous service, and that still holds true. However, there is huge potential to take customer service to the next level by making it more personal, targeted and relevant. Customer expectations are changing and, today, customers expect businesses to service them as individuals, not as a segment. The potential to elevate customer satisfaction, therefore, lies in the ability to mine customer insights to deliver service or product offerings that are highly personalised.\n\nCompanies like SAS can today help businesses harness Big Data and analytics for a 360-degree view of their customers. Insights derived from the customer's past actions and behaviours - or better yet, how they might act or behave in the future - can help businesses target individual customers with anticipated offers tailored to their preferences and delivered at the right time via their preferred channels. In this era when the customer has more power than ever before, the ability to leverage insight for better service delivery can help businesses make an emotional-level connection with customers that will ultimately translate into lasting brand loyalty.\n\nToru Shimada\n\nManaging Director, Chairman and CEO\n\nRakuten Asia Pte Ltd\n\nAS businesses look for more creative ways to get ahead of the competition, excellent customer service never fails to leave behind a trail of satisfied customers, while helping to raise industry standards. Japanese hospitality is often referred to as the gold standard, and the secret behind it is ''Omotenashi''. This is a popular Japanese phrase that means ''to entertain guests wholeheartedly'', and was used to capture the essence of Japanese hospitality during the candidature speech for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.\n\nOmotenashi is also the driving spirit behind our e-commerce business. To achieve 100 per cent customer satisfaction, we anticipate the needs of customers, and go above and beyond to make them happy. This is integral to building sustainable, long-term relationships with our merchants and consumers, and is a core part of Rakuten's business model to create relationships between merchants, and between merchants and consumers.\n\nLow Lee Yong\n\nCEO & Founder\n\nMHC Asia Group of companies\n\nCUSTOMER service culture begins with society itself - whether people are warm and communicative by nature. Perception of service levels is also affected by individual expectations, which are influenced by society's level of sophistication. Singapore isn't too bad. But I travel the region and frequently encounter sparks of service excellence in places such as the Philippines and Indonesia. So, yes, good customer service can be cultivated through intentional training. But we must also take things in context. For example, in critical healthcare services, where tough clinical decisions need to be made over life and death, you do not expect the medical team to ''please'' the patient and family the same way we do in a retail setting. It is unrealistic to have the same KPIs. The sooner we realise and move away from regarding patients as typical ''customers'', the better the doctors and nurses are able to deliver good, effective medicine without the pressure of being rated poorly.\n\nTeo Lay Lim\n\nSenior Managing Director\n\nAccenture, Asean\n\nCHANGING customer behaviour in the digital marketplace and low levels of customer satisfaction are fuelling a ''switching economy'' - the revenue potential driven by customer switching. Growth is harder to come by in many sectors but the switching economy presents a source of new and profitable growth for companies that choose to play to win. This requires a holistic approach that goes beyond simply implementing customer relationship management technologies.\n\nCompanies need to create engaging customer experiences that today's ''non-stop'' customers are seeking. Done right, customer experiences can become a source of competitive differentiation that pull companies away from competition. Success in the age of the non-stop customer does not all come down to digital; it comes down to knowing how to leverage both the digital and offline worlds in a seamlessly integrated way, giving customers the ability to choose their own experience and maximise control over how they interact with companies. That control extends to their personal information and how companies balance creative use of digital applications with privacy and data security.\n\nRichard Hoon\n\nCEO\n\nI Search Worldwide Group of Companies\n\nNOT good! And if Singapore desires to be a global economy, we have much room for improvement in the service arena. Our younger generation is growing up in a privileged environment where they are constantly being served. With growing expectations and affluence, they become more demanding for service but they have not learnt to serve others. We need to be elegant people first and we will be ready to receive good service. Only when we have served others will we appreciate what it takes to deliver good service. We will then be grateful and appreciative if someone makes an effort to serve us well. A good recipient always enjoys good service! We need a cultural change to become elegant people in a gracious society first. Good service will follow. Training helps but we need the change to come from within us. We will then have the confidence and knowledge that service is not servanthood and that serving one another is a privilege. The service mindset must begin at home.\n\nKevin Wo\n\nSenior Vice-President & Asean MD\n\nAvanade\n\nCUSTOMER experience is the most important factor in a buying decision, so it is natural that service standards will be on the rise - as revealed in Avanade's ''New Customer Journey'' survey which explored the changing sales process. With business buyers in Singapore willing to pay up to 34 per cent more for a product or service that rewards them with an improved customer experience, it is clear why 98 per cent of companies have changed at least one business process in the past three years to improve their customer interaction.\n\nAt Avanade, embracing new technology is part of the equation for improving the customer experience. IT is at the epicentre of this change for businesses, and has played a greater role in the overall customer experience than it has in the past. When companies differentiate themselves to create an engaging experience and to develop lasting customer relationships, it lessens the market pressure to make things differently and moves the business strategy needle from reactive to proactive.\n\nWilliam Chu\n\nPresident\n\nAvnet Technology Solutions Asia Pacific\n\nTHE service delivered is only as good as the people who deliver it and, at Avnet, we have engaged and committed team members in Singapore who care about their customers. As a solutions and services company, people are our greatest asset, and we are committed to ensuring our staff have the expertise, skills and resources needed to accelerate the success of our customers, business partners and suppliers.\n\nCustomer engagement is a continuous pursuit for us; we take great pride in listening and taking action when our customers give us feedback. Last year, when we received suggestions to streamline our feedback loop, we simplified and optimised the measurement process to reduce the timeframe between a problem and a solution.\n\nWith rapid access to insights into our customers' needs and concerns, we can use analytics to make the correct decision. In return our customers have greater engagement and access to Avnet.\n\nPhilip Yuen\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nDeloitte Singapore\n\nSERVICE standards in Singapore have clearly improved in the past few years and many retailers have leveraged technology to build customer relationship management databases and loyalty programmes to better understand and serve their customers. However, there are still areas for improvement, particularly in relation to how organisations provide consumers with a seamless service experience. Customers are becoming more sophisticated and expect the same high quality service across all channels, but many organisations are still focused only on providing the ultimate in-store customer experience. They sometimes neglect to provide this same level of service across their other channels, such as websites, social media or call centres.\n\nTo achieve this, organisations need to take a holistic approach towards customer interaction - including anticipating their preferences and purchasing behaviour - regardless of touch points, which for many companies is a significant investment and a step into the unknown. As they strive to raise the bar in customer service and increase satisfaction levels, more and more of our clients are reaching out to us to assist them in enhancing their overall customer experience across the consumer value chain.\n\nDhirendra Shantilal\n\nBoard Director & Head of Asia Pacific\n\nFircroft\n\nIN order for Singapore to remain competitive, we must raise our service standards across the board. There is plenty of room to do that. Customers should be at the heart of everything the enterprise does. Increasingly, demanding customers expect both value and quality service. Not one or the other. Delivering a consistently high quality level of service will ultimately lead to a more loyal customer base and create brand loyalty which will lead to earnings improvements. To effect real change in service standards, enterprises need to build customer service into the core of their business and not add it as an afterthought. Everyone within the business needs to be groomed to manage client relationships long term. Proper recruitment and retention policies are key. Staff should enter the business with the right mindset, while retention is the secret to grooming staff who build relationships, analyse client behaviour and offer great customer service. Staff should also be recognised and rewarded for the level of service they provide their customers.\n\nTakeo Shimazu\n\nManaging Director\n\nBrother International Singapore\n\nSERVICE has always been a key differentiating factor, especially as business environments homogenise to offer similar experiences. We laud the Singapore government for advocating service excellence within companies and organisations. Programmes and awards such as Workforce Skills Qualifications and Singapore Service Excellence Medallion encourage businesses to enhance service standards and customer experience.\n\nBrother implements a ''Customer-First'' approach in all aspects of our business and this helps to strengthen our relationship with customers. Our motto is ''at your side'' and so we always strive to deliver superior customer experience by differentiating and innovating our service offerings by listening to what our customers say. We want them to be treated with the best service by investing in employee development. Members of our staff undergo training to enhance their skills to remain competitive while incorporating our service values in day-to-day operations.\n\nCynthia Stuckey\n\nManaging Director, Asia Pacific\n\nThe Forum Corporation\n\nWHILE there are some shining exceptions, many organisations in Singapore have quite a way to go when it comes to service excellence. There is also a tendency to mix customer satisfaction with customer service experience when, in fact, they are extremely different.\n\nCementing customer satisfaction requires a service position that is consistent, predictable and viewed as valuable in your customers' eyes. It entails an intentional delivery of the customer promise and defined experience through every single interaction with the company's people, processes, products and services. Forum's research and experience indicate that the key to achieving this is in keeping it simple, practical and on strategy.\n\nFirst, companies must understand what their customers want and expect, and then analyse their own employees' behaviours to modify and align their actions to the expectations and needs of their customers.\n\nSecond, establish the service and experience processes and define the types of behaviour that deliver a satisfying experience at all touch points. The challenge is that information is now flowing to the customer across multiple channels both within and beyond the company's control. It is therefore important to align all channels to the process and behaviours.\n\nThird, train the team to exhibit the behaviour that drives customer satisfaction and loyalty, and engage leaders as champions. In most successful cases we've seen, leaders receive a significant amount of capability development to learn how to observe, manage and execute a consistent customer experience - as much as, if not more than, the rest of the frontline staff.\n\nFinally, implement a customer experience scorecard that will enable management to track types of behaviour versus activities on a sustained basis.\n\nJoshua Yim\n\nCEO\n\nAchieve Group\n\nIF we benchmark Singapore as a First World country, then I believe there is a gap in our service standards compared with other advanced nations which generally deliver very attentive and engaging service. It is easy to understand why this is so. For starters, it is a structural problem associated with the social perceptions of certain frontline jobs being unglamorous. This is further worsened by a lack of training in this area. Being seen as not glamorous, many Singaporeans do not wish to take on these jobs - which then go to those who do not come from a high academic background and may not be well trained. We also depend a lot on foreign workers for such frontline work and many come from Third World countries, even rural areas, so we cannot expect them to immediately transform themselves to perform at First World service standards. Naturally, they require training but, being on short-term Work Permits and S-Passes, companies generally hesitate to invest in training them up. Traditionally, these frontline service jobs (save for financial services) are viewed much less glamorously in Singapore than in Europe or the United States, thereby worsening the phenomena of low service standards here. Companies ought to send their staff - whether Singaporeans or foreign workers -for aggressive training and skills upgrading. They should also roll out customer-centric initiatives such as the ''mystery shopper'' audit and customer satisfaction surveys. I have personally encountered certain food and beverage outlets and hospitals that really invest in training their people and the difference in service delivery is very evident. I believe the only way to plug the customer service gap within the Singapore landscape is through training and there are no two ways about it.\n\nUltimately, there must be a shift in paradigm over the next generation so that the general public will one day view these frontline positions as professional equivalents, just as they do in Western Europe and North America. Otherwise, it will continue to be a challenge to attract Singaporeans to take on these positions.\n\nChris Wei\n\nGroup CEO\n\nGreat Eastern Holdings\n\nIN this day and age of rising consumer expectations and higher customer demands, companies need to find new and innovative ways to raise the standard of service excellence and to consistently delight customers to build sustainable customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nAt Great Eastern, we place customer relationships at the very core of our business strategy. Central to our customer-centric culture is our fundamental belief of spending time with customers to glean insights. This was the primary motivation behind the setting up of our imaGEnation Studio in 2012. Through the work done at the studio, we have obtained new insights into our customers' lives, and attempted to re-imagine and re-design the insurance experience so that it can be more meaningful for our customers.\n\nWe believe in fostering a culture of service excellence where, collectively, we treat our customers with respect, consistently create and deliver superior value and service as well as professional advice. We understand we are not perfect and that there is always room for improvement, thus we work hard to communicate proactively as well as address promptly customer concerns and feedback.\n\nTo earn the trust and loyalty of our customers, we must remain committed to the belief that it is our collective responsibility as an organisation, from top management to employees to our distribution force, to create positive ''moments of truth'' each time, every time.\n\nChris Mead\n\nRegional Director\n\nHays in Singapore & Malaysia\n\nPROFESSIONAL firms are very focused on providing great service and we believe that jobseekers and employers in Singapore should expect world class service too. They should be able to deal with a recruiter who uses world best-practice, with processes that have been developed and validated in line with quality assured standards so only proven methodologies are used.\n\nAs testament to this, in January 2014, Hays in Singapore was awarded the world-leading ISO 9001:2008 certification in recognition of a management system conforming to world-leading standards.\n\nUsing external measures such as ISO enables companies not only to benchmark themselves against a global standard but it also means they have to think about how they embed high levels of service across the business. It has certainly worked for Hays as we have held this accreditation for 20 years in the region and, through continuous improvement, we remain committed to providing the best possible service.\n\nHugues Delcourt\n\nCountry Executive, ABN Amro Bank NV Singapore and\n\nCEO of ABN Amro Private Banking Asia & Middle East\n\nFIRST-RATE service excellence requires a total approach. In other words, excellent customer service is the result of all of the components being in place - the right culture, good people as well as good systems and processes. My experience in Singapore of customer service standards, whether in the public or private sectors, over the past three years has been mostly a happy one and, on some occasions, I have indeed been delighted beyond my expectations.\n\nThere is one area where we in the services or people industries should be mindful of and that is to continue improving the English proficiency levels of our employees as part of raising the bar in service excellence. Singapore is to be lauded as one of the early adopters post-independence of English as the language of business and commerce, as well as for instruction in schools. This strategy has paid dividends as Singapore is known for one of the highest English literacy rates in the region. With Singapore ranking among the world's most sought after global cities to live, work and play in, now more than ever there is an important need to inculcate and sustain in our employees fluency and proficiency in English for effective communication with customers who have high expectations of the Singapore brand. Effective communication with our customers is not just about grammar or textbook accuracy. It is about conveying one's message or intent with clarity and a sense of context.\n\nMike Raines\n\nPresident and CEO\n\nAIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte Ltd\n\nTHE Singapore customer has high expectations of the businesses they interact with and it appears that organisations do try to meet these expectations with a high level of service. The government also serves to protect the consumer through various laws and regulatory bodies. In order to ensure or raise service excellence, organisations should implement automated customer satisfaction measures to ensure that the monitoring of customer service is an everyday part of their business. AIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte Ltd implemented the automated Net Promoter Score (NPS) in 2008 to consistently track the satisfaction of our customers, agents and brokers at various touch points during the insurance cycle. It is through daily monitoring of feedback that we are able to ensure we continue doing what works and address any areas for improvement. As the market develops, we are committed to serving the customer in the best way we can and keeping our ear to the ground to always ensure their voices are heard.\n\nPatrick Linden\n\nCEO\n\niBUY\n\nIN line with its swift advancement and economic miracle status, industries in Singapore have historically placed a premium on efficiency.\n\nWhen an individual's definition of service is, however, tied to expecting a personal and fulfilling experience, there is definite room for improvement.\n\nLocally, we have a tendency to define customer service in numeric terms, whether it be response times or the number of complaints, e-mails or calls attended to within a certain period.\n\nThese metrics are undoubtedly important but, in the process, other important factors become undervalued. Within a more structured corporate setting, such as at DEAL.com.sg, service excellence and customer satisfaction can be improved by guiding service staff through formal and professional training, rewarding outstanding service, facilitating open feedback loops to encourage recommendations for improvement and clearly defining performance expectations of staff from the outset. As they say, if you chase perfection, you'll catch excellence.\n\nTan Poh Lan\n\nCEO\n\nFortis Healthcare Singapore\n\nWHILE I have confidence in the quality of our service standards, there is certainly room for improvement and areas where we need to keep up with our regional counterparts. This is especially so for service industries where options are aplenty and competition is fierce, providers need to take extra effort in ensuring service excellence at every possible customer touch points. Specific to healthcare where expectations for quality service is high and demanding, the intangibles will no doubt shape the overall experience for patients and their next-of-kin. At Fortis Healthcare Singapore, we believe that good service is the lifeblood of any business. Both Fortis Surgical Hospital and RadLink Diagnostic monitor our patients' feedback very closely to ensure we are on track to achieving optimal patient satisfaction. As every patient and condition is different, we believe that extending personalised service offering is the key defining factor in delivering service excellence.\n\nMax Loh\n\nCountry Managing Partner\n\nErnst & Young LLP\n\nOVERALL service standards in Singapore have been on the rise in recent years despite lagging other developed economies. At the heart of service excellence are the people. The service provider must have a genuine desire to serve and delight; an appreciative customer is one of the strongest motivators of excellent service. In other words, ''give and you shall receive''. Even as continued investments in incentives and training - both at the national and corporate levels - to promote service excellence across sectors will be vital, we need to foster a society that values and respects service jobs. Companies must also recognise that meeting customer expectations is a mere baseline, and may not be sufficient to drive customer loyalty. With increased consumer sophistication, heightened awareness and accessibility to a range of possibilities, and changing expectations of service experiences given the rise of digital, service providers have to continually find new and innovative ways to keep the customer engaged.\n\nRobin C Lee\n\nGroup COO\n\nBok Seng Group\n\nSERVICE industries have always played a critical role in the economy of Singapore, a country whose sole resource is its population. In fact, the workforce size of the service sector has increased immensely in the past two decades and continues to grow. Therefore, attention to detail and great service quality is becoming more important than ever and a key aspect to consider when a company wants to position itself more successfully in the marketplace. Unfortunately, despite all the talk and hype about excellent service, I feel that the standard of service in Singapore is still lower than its global competitors. It is often easy to push the blame solely to service staff, but oftentimes the culprit behind the lower quality can also be customers who do not show respect or appreciation when being served. Good service can and should be reciprocated in terms of respect and appreciation in both monetary and non-monetary forms. This is not an excuse, but rather a gentle reminder to customers that service staff are people as well with feelings and emotions. However, this does not diminish the effort we as a company put into providing excellent service and we will continue to do so to the best of our ability. At the same time, when companies are way too eager to boost earnings through productivity, it can often be at the expense of lower quality service: Less staff, lack of attention, the absence of the human touch. I believe that excellent service is the responsibility of the service staff first and foremost, but it wouldn't hurt for customers to appreciate the service provided. Only good can come out from this symbiotic relationship.\n\nDavid Low\n\nCEO\n\nFuturistic Store Fixtures Pte Ltd\n\nI FEEL our service standards in the F&B and finance sectors have been compromised in recent years. With rising costs of rental and new regulations on foreign talent impacting operation costs, it is possible that service staff are overstretched with additional duties and responsibilities resulting in slackened service standards and attitudes. With Singapore being positioned as the wealth management hub of Asia, we have to ensure that the service standards of our financial advisers, for instance, are in line with the hub status. My own experience finds otherwise. There is a seeming lack of knowledge sharing and detailed explanation of financial instruments, making risk and benefit analysis less than adequate for making investment decisions. The sales-driven attitude overshadows any authenticity in serving and meeting the client's needs. Apart from customised staff training catered to each specific industry and role, a focus on corporate culture is important to drive home the message of serving with passion. KPIs and monetary incentives could be pegged to not just tangibles but intangibles in the form of positive customer feedback to encourage dedication in providing utmost customer satisfaction with each transaction. Start from the recruitment stage in identifying the appropriate personality and talent, to continuous training and cultivation of corporate values. I look forward to seeing more pleasant surprises in the next customer satisfaction index report.\n\nToby Koh\n\nGroup Managing Director\n\nAdemco Security Group\n\nSERVICE levels have generally improved in recent years. Companies have put in conscious effort and resources to boost client satisfaction. This stems from the competitive business arena in Singapore. Client retention strategy is of utmost importance for all businesses. The government has been encouraging the use of technology to enhance service delivery. In Ademco, we have invested heavily in technology to improve client experience with us. Engineers at a client's site have tablets with mobile broadband connectivity so as to allow service to be delivered in a timely fashion to enhance client experience. Every visit to a client site is followed by requests for feedback via a client satisfaction survey. This serves to keep a constant tab on the level of service that we are providing. Nonetheless, despite all the deployment of technology, having a service mindset is imperative. We have seen on many occasions where a sincere pleasant disposition with a smile will win the client over. And this positive service attitude can only be effective when one understands and appreciate good service.\n\nPhilippe H J Huinck\n\nRegional Managing Director, South and South East Asia\n\nInternational SOS\n\nSINGAPORE should be congratulated for having improved its customer service index score for 2013. It is definitely a huge milestone for us and we should continue to strive towards service excellence and raising the levels of customer satisfaction.\n\nI believe that driving service excellence starts from the top of an organisation. The senior management needs to set the culture and cascade this to its employees. From recruiting talents with the right attitude, giving them the necessary infrastructure and support at work to improve their productivity and service delivery, equipping them with quality training, to recognising and rewarding them for delivering excellent service, these are just some examples how an organisation can raise the levels of service excellence and customer satisfaction.\n\nAt International SOS, part of our recruitment process is to identify talents who embrace our company values. We hire staff with not only the relevant expertise but who also, at the same time, show passion in their profession, and who can care for our clients and the company. For example, when we do at times make mistakes at work, we put even more effort into making sure we do not make the same mistake twice. Our focus is on fixing the one complaint we get rather than on celebrating the 20 compliments we receive.\n\nThe company also leverages on technology and automation. We have invested in a customised IT infrastructure and developed our own service provider platform. The platform is used at our Assistance Centres, aimed at delivering timely, quality service to our clients. Our employees are also equipped with regular training sessions, enabling them to continually upgrade and update their skills. Last but not least, being a company with a global footprint, we also share Singapore's best practices on service excellence across the regions.\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nIT depends on which sector one is referring to. For example, it is common knowledge that service standards in the food and beverage industry generally leave much to be desired. This is mainly due to the acute manpower crunch that businesses in this sector face, where employers have little choice but to fill frontline positions with foreigners and part-timers such as students. These groups usually take on the jobs with a short-term view and thus we can understand how the transient nature of such roles often translates to poor service rendered, due largely to a lack of training. As for other areas such as customer service in call centres and professional services such as finance, I believe Singapore's service standards are relatively high due to the skilled workforce. To raise the levels of service excellence and customer satisfaction, I would strongly recommend sending employees for more training programmes as knowledge builds confidence and improves efficiency of service delivery. Companies should also work towards instilling the ethos of service excellence as a key pillar of their corporate culture and implement programmes that offer incentives to staff who deliver great service, as these would help service staff take greater pride in their jobs. However, where the F&B industry is concerned, the situation is a lot more complex. Staffing problems are at the root of poor service in F&B and this manpower shortage is now exacerbated by the tightened quota on the number of foreigners that can be hired. The industry itself needs a lot of restructuring and perhaps a paradigm and cultural shift is required. For example, I understand that some of the F&B industry associations have been looking into this problem for some time now and one proposal is to raise the professionalism and perception of jobs in F&B. This will require a paradigm shift for significant change to begin here. In the meantime, businesses in this sector will need to find much more innovative ways to attract and retain the right people. From a macro perspective, this issue could also be tackled on a national level so that service excellence becomes a part of our Singaporean identity, just like how Thailand has come to be known as ''The Land of Smiles''.\n\nDora Hoan\n\nCo-Chairman/Group CEO\n\nBest World International Ltd\n\nI THINK there is room for improvement in service standards in Singapore. Every Singaporean must do his or her part to give a foreigner or tourist a good service experience. We can do so through our educational system and through upbringing. There is a need for families to inculcate the need to provide excellent service, especially since Singapore relies on tourism to grow our economy. We can learn from the Japanese - they have good service standards because it's in their blood (taught by their families) to provide good service. Besides that, companies can provide training not just for frontline staff but also the rest of the staff, so that good service attitude is a strong attribute across the firm. Additionally, companies can also reward frontline staff to motivate others.\n\nCheng Heng Chew\n\nCountry Manager\n\nAmerican Express Singapore\n\nGIVEN that the services account for about three quarters of Singapore's GDP, improvements in service standards have no doubt benefited the economy and the lives of Singaporeans. Even as the public and private sectors focus on lifting service standards, challenges including talent recruitment remain.\n\nAs a global service company, upholding our brand promise to deliver world-class service and personal recognition to card members, partners and customers is core to our business and close to the heart of all employees. Instilling a service culture is the foundation to great service, and great service starts with the people who deliver it. We hire people who are passionate about service, empower them and give recognition when they go above and beyond customer expectations. Knowing what our customers think after every interaction is important, and we measure how well we are doing by asking our customers if they would recommend American Express to others based on their experience with us. Highly satisfied customers have strong engagement with our brand. They spend more with us and remain loyal. That is why service is a competitive differentiator no brand can ignore.\n\nGurpreet Dhillon\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nReligare Health Trust\n\nFINANCE and healthcare are two sectors named as having seen their consumer satisfaction levels drop. The mention of Healthcare comes as a surprise, given the continued praise we hear both generally and within the healthcare sector of the continually improving standards here in Singapore and across Asia. Singapore remains an important medical tourism destination, with service quality being one key reason, along with the standard of care and level of healthcare expertise. Service excellence relies heavily on the human touch for the customer or patient to feel at ease. It is difficult given how desensitised we have become with the convenience of technology. There needs to be a focus on adapting technology and technological advances into better care for patients not only in medical terms but also responsiveness and service standards.\n\nLawrence Koh\n\nFounder and Managing Director\n\niFly Singapore\n\nSINGAPORE'S service culture has certainly improved across the different business sectors. However, it is often inconsistent between firms within the same industry and, in most cases, still has a long way to go to catch up to standards overseas. This is largely due to the lack of corporate governance to ensure a sustainable service excellence model. Firms should first identify key pillars and set clear goals with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to create an excellent service environment for their business. This model should provide and support the delivery of excellent customer service that is not only consistent but sustainable. This should include incentives tied to the KPIs and constant training for employees. An effective feedback loop system will also ensure that customers' needs are addressed promptly and accurately.\n\nLastly, managers including senior management should always keep their ears on the ground and make sure they understand the ground issues first hand and listen to what their stakeholders (both customers and frontline staff) are saying to them. With a tighter feedback loop, brands can increase affinity with all stakeholders and progressively produce better offerings that meet and exceed expectations.\n\nBarathan Pasupathi\n\nCEO\n\nJetstar Asia Airways Pte Ltd\n\nAT Jetstar Asia, we place our customers at the centre of everything we do. Happy customers increase customer satisfaction scores and set the business up for long-term success. We have seen repeated success from our investment in raising the bar on service standards and performance in the low-cost carrier (LCC) market as we continue to be the standard for everyday low fares, fun travel and great value in Singapore.\n\nService standards are on the uptrend in Singapore with banks adopting innovative banking solutions, hotels and restaurants investing in brilliant facilities and even taxi companies adopting booking applications. However, with the workforce focused on academic excellence, many are shunning roles in the service sector. The added pressures of constrained resourcing has also resulted in tightening training lead times, resulting in slipping standards of service. This is most evident in restaurants, bars and hotels. Singapore is lagging behind compared with their counterparts across South-east Asia.\n\nIt is Jetstar's mission to consistently offer hassle-free and enjoyable experiences from the time a customer books through to the moment they collect their bags. To this effect, Jetstar is the first airline in the region to introduce a customer charter which reinforces our commitment to customer service. The Jetstar Customer Guarantee affirms our commitment to excellence in customer service and reflects ongoing improvements the airline has been putting in place for customers.\n\nIn terms of innovation and technology, we are constantly improving our quality in service standards through first contact technologies. Just last week, Jetstar Asia launched a new 24-hour virtual assistant service on the Singapore website to offer customers the best in online self-service technology. The service called Ask Jess answers online queries on including booking, baggage and seating like a real call centre agent. However, customers who choose to may also use the call centre, live chat at Jetstar.com, Facebook or Twitter.\n\nOrganisations should take a deep and honest review of how they are communicating, engaging their company values and empowering frontline teams to foster service excellence. Depending on the type of business, innovation and relevant technologies may raise standards and productivity to make the customer experience positive especially during problem resolution. Businesses need to attend openly and promptly to issues to win the trust and reliability of the customer, an element that is critical to customer satisfaction.\n\nDavid Leong\n\nManaging Director\n\nPeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd\n\nSERVICE excellence is a demanding endeavour that demands a national level mindset orientation. It starts with ''how to'' delight customers, tourists and neighbouring countries' perceptions of Singapore. Service excellence is the softer side of business. Not just plain efficient transactions but building on an experience - positive experience. Hardware, infrastructure and iconic buildings can be emulated and copied quickly with money but service excellence cannot be built in an instance with money. It is as much cultural as it is social and it must be built into the national psyche.\n\nSingapore must up the service quotient to remain competitive since the service industry is one of the economic dynamos in Singapore. Such attitudinal change and influence must begin with every individual. This must be ingrained right from one's schooldays.\n\nEventually excellence in service delivery will set apart the winners from the losers. Not how much hardware but how the hardware is put together with the correct attitudes - a service attitude. Even our Singapore Changi Airport has Changi Experience Agents whose role is to delight passengers and to generate positive ''feel-good'' points for Singapore.\n\nMike Muller\n\nPresident, Asia Pacific\n\nAvaya\n\nSINGAPORE service standards have improved steadily over the past few years. As a service economy and a business hub, it is believed that a nation's success depends largely on its ability to ensure high service quality and a seamless user experience. Information sharing and availability of new media channels make it easier to share information. In today's age, customers are also far more informed, aware and connected. A recent Avaya Customer Experience survey reveals that four out of five customers are likely to switch brands with bad experience. Research also shows that 70 per cent of customers are willing to pay at least 10 per cent more to a company that provides better cross-channel service experience. And as the communication landscape evolves, social media explosion is finding its way into the customer service world, challenging companies to interact with their customers in ways they had not considered before. Customer ''experience'' is also no longer the preserve of customer service departments alone. To stay competent, businesses will need to consider leveraging Customer Experience Management strategies that can help integrate and optimise each interaction with the customer. Unified and simplified multi-channel self-service options available today can ensure proactive engagement on a single software platform and can offer greater visibility, insights, control and an integrated, omni-channel customer experience.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A deal is expected to be completed in the third quarter, Holzminden, Germany-based Symrise said in a statement. It expects the acquisition to be earnings accretive from 2015.\n\nChief executive officer Heinz-Juergen Bertram is seizing the opportunity to acquire one of a limited number of larger targets in the flavours and fragrance industry to accelerate its growth and access natural raw materials. The purchase of Vannes, France-based Diana also adds a pet-food additives business whose earnings are more resilient to the ups and downs of consumer spending.\n\n\"Although Symrise's interest in Diana was flagged in the media in February they will have some explaining to do in this morning's analyst call because Diana's biggest business is pet not human nutrition and the price is punchy,\" Adam Collins, an analyst at Liberum, said in a note.\n\nThe Symrise deal values Diana at about 14 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, which totalled about 425 million euros in 2013, with margins of about 21 per cent.\n\nThe combined business will have pro-forma sales of nearly 2.3 billion euros, Symrise said. Market leader, Givaudan of Switzerland, generated the equivalent of 3.6 billion euros in sales last year, according to Bloomberg data.\n\n\"The proposed acquisition represents a major milestone for Symrise right after our 10th anniversary, and is fully in line with our strategic objective to further accelerate profitable growth,\" Mr Bertram said in the statement.\n\nThe flavours and fragrance industry is dominated by four leaders, a group that also includes closely held Firmenich International SA of Switzerland.\n\nAnother forthcoming opportunity is Wild Flavors GmbH. Owner Hans-Peter Wild and buyout firm KKR & Co are exploring strategic options including a sale of the maker of flavourings for food and beverages, people with knowledge of the matter said in January.\n\nThe French company's offering spans food additives based on natural vegetable and animal-based products and colourings used in beverages, sweets and sauces. It's expanded into the nutraceutical market, where nutrition and ingredients are formulated to try to prevent and combat diseases. Last month, Diana agreed to collaborate on cancer research with the Oregon Translational Research and Development Institute, providing expertise on plant cell cultures.\n\nMr Bertram may need to convince some investors that diversifying into the pet-food business is the correct path to take, Mr Collins said. His likely rationale will likely be that both businesses use natural ingredients and have the similar dynamics, and that Diana will benefit from Symrise's global network, the analyst said.\n\nStamford Partners LLP acted as the sole financial adviser to Symrise on the deal.

Closed on Sun\n\nSO here's what I think Alpine cuisine is. Cheese fondue. Served by a milkmaid named Heidi who spent the morning squeezing the udders of family cows Ursula and Matilda, before sitting down to a hearty meal of boiled meat and potatoes, stone-hard bread with rendered bacon fat, strudel for dessert, washed down with apple cider and grog.\n\nNo, I don't know what alpine cuisine is.\n\nZOTT'S, on the other hand, is eager to enlighten you at its over-the-top, stylised temple to European mountain cooking in Amoy Street. Except that what strikes you first isn't the food, but how the owners have managed to squeeze a fine dining restaurant, art gallery and cow theme park into the very narrow confines of this restored shophouse - all in meticulous, elaborate (expensive) fashion.\n\nStep into the cool, gunmetal grey interior with its artfully positioned lighting, and giant oil paintings leap out at you from your left, behind protective glass walls. Russian artists, you're told, even though you don't ask. They're all for sale and you're given a catalogue - even though you don't ask.\n\nJust in case your living room could use a Satanic metal sculpture of a horned horse nuzzling/about to eat an ugly pink baby. The glass-encased ox head that fronts the open kitchen is apparently the taxidermied pet of the owner, Christian Zott (hence the restaurant's name), but we forget to ask if that's for sale too.\n\nIf someone introduces a restaurant bathroom of the year award, ZOTT'S restroom would win, hooves down, for its fantastical/ludicrous rendition of alpine sanitation. A massive bovine peers at you through the mirror, as cowbells ring, cows moo and yodellers, well, yodel, in the background. I can't say for sure, but I think I heard a cow cough in mid-moo.\n\nYou really have to give it to them for their painstaking attention to detail. In a sea of cookie-cutter grunge-cool designer eateries which have to make do with limited resources, ZOTT'S stands out for its no-expense-spared approach. That extends to the menu, too, which takes the form of a heavy hardback that chronicles the concept and geography of the cuisine on offer. Just don't over-think the whole alpine concept - it's a loose interpretation that includes all of Europe's mountainous regions from Germany to France, Italy and Switzerland, so just about anything goes.\n\nChef Lorenz-Maria Griesser's cooking leans towards Bavarian and Austrian multi-syllabic specialities such as Kaiserschmarrn (souffle pancake), Tellerfleisch (beef done three ways) or Geshmorte Lammschulter (lamb shoulder). So being the alpine troupers we are, we order: Bouillabaise. A traditional Provencal fish stew originating from the port city of Marseille, says Wikipedia. According to our heavily accented ZOTT'S server, we gather that water from the mountains flows into the Mediterranean, so you know, it's technically alpine.\n\nNever mind. It's delicious. Even though at $87, you're subsidising the airfare of the red mullet, sea bass, scorpion fish (rascasse) and turbot which are all flown fresh from their home waters because the restaurant wants to ensure full authenticity of the dish.\n\nApart from the strong flavour of the mullet, the rest of the fish add to the delicate body of the seafood bisque that is further pumped up with the accompanying rouille and baby baguette slices.\n\nWe're pretty impressed with Chef Griesser's sure hand and innovative approach, as in the Carpacio d'Espadon ($28), where lightly marinated raw swordfish is adorned with salmon roe and a whimsical \"apple creation\" where pureed frozen apple is shaped to look like the real thing complete with red gelatin skin. The light ice cream-like mixture adds a mild sweetness to the savoury, slightly fishy swordfish sashimi.\n\nAlso a winner is the Suedtiroler Apfelsuppe ($26) - a creamy apple soup made from a blend of fruit, chicken broth and tomatoes, poured over a silky-textured slab of lightly smoked Arctic char, tiny balls of very sweet apple and pebble-like potatoes. The mouth feel of fish and barely discernible saltiness works in tandem with the sweet-savoury, lightly thickened broth.\n\nThe Bondage Chicken hints at a macho specimen trussed up and carted to your table, but the puny partner in this tryst speaks volumes of how big really is better. Do you want to pay $36 for a pigeon-sized bird with no alpine affiliation? Even if cooked rotiserrie-tender with a scant flavour of Bavarian paprika and curry powder seasoning? Upsizing is perhaps in order here.\n\nWe do, however, wish that Kaiserschmarrn ($24) could replace souffle in the cooking lexicon because it takes the airiness of the latter and the fluffiness of a pancake and creates dessert heaven dusted with powdered sugar, served with vanilla ice cream and stewed plums. If you prefer desserts you can drink, we recommend the boozy milkshake masquerading as a buttermilk cocktail ($24) that you drink out of a horn.\n\nDining above sea level comes at a premium at ZOTT'S, so it's up to you to decide if the change of scenery is worth it. You can also argue till the cows come home about the definition of alpine cuisine but we're happy to give ZOTT'S its due for believing in itself and putting its money where its mouth is.

By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 11, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nBMW's M Performance range is attractive because it promises good performance with everyday driveability, and one especially enticing model is the M235i.\n\nSlotted between a normal BMW and an M car, the BMW M235i Coup\u00e9 looks and feels more special than a conventional Beemer but is otherwise devoid of any hard-core overtones.\n\nThis extends to its styling, where the small and sleek two-door model gets subtle tweaks like an M front apron and grey door mirrors. It also wears a small M badge on its front fender and 18-inch M light alloy wheels. The latter is a mixed set with fatter rear tyres and rubber that was developed specially for the car by Michelin.\n\nInside, there are front sports seats and a thick-rimmed M steering wheel for the perfect driving position, unless of course you're an NBA player.\n\nThe meters look no different from a conventional BMW's although they are. But one cool feature stands out - a virtual image of the M235i badge in full colour at the bottom of the instrument cluster when the engine is running.\n\nUnder the hood is BMW's familiar 3.0-litre straight six turbocharged engine. But unlike the versions in the 335i or 435i, the M235i's unit has been upgraded by the M division.\n\nAlert and enthusiastic\n\nIts usual cast iron crankshaft has been replaced by a stronger one made of steel, and the engine mapping is new. The cooling system is also improved.\n\nWith 326 hp and 450 Nm instead of the usual 35i engine's 306 hp and 400 Nm, the just under 1,500 kg M235i is a potent package. With so much extra torque, the small coup\u00e9 feels so alert and enthusiastic.\n\nThe familiar eight-speed Sport automatic transmission drives the rear wheels with the same rapid shifts using the electronic gear lever or the steering wheel-mounted shift paddles.\n\nIn keeping with the understated nature of the M Performance line, the M235i has a low but purposed exhaust growl. It does get deeper further up the rev range but it is never intrusive.\n\nAs with other BMWs, there is the option of Eco Pro, Comfort, Sport and Sport+ driving modes.\n\nEach modifies the accelerator mapping and steering characteristics accordingly, with Sport mode tightening the steering, making it more reassuring at speed but at the same time also reducing the feedback you would normally get in Comfort setting.\n\nPerhaps the nicest aspect of the M235i is that it can be driven hard or normally. Most cars are able to do one or the other well, but rarely both.\n\nThe M235i offers both options - sporty driving pleasure when you're feeling aggressive, or a relaxed driving style when you're more chill.\n\nThe firm fixed rate dampers mean that handling can get a bit choppy if you start thrashing it but the M235i will settle down as soon as you do too. Because of all these attributes, it is the refined alternative.\n\nsamuelee@sph.com.sg\n\nSPECS\n\nBMW M235i Coup\u00e9\n\nEngine\n\n2,979 cc inline-6 turbocharged\n\nTransmission\n\n8-speed automatic\n\nMax power\n\n326 hp @ 5,800-6,000 rpm\n\nMax torque\n\n450 Nm @ 1,300-4,500 rpm\n\n0-100 kmh\n\n4.8 secs\n\nTop speed\n\n250 kmh\n\nCO2 emissions\n\n176 g/km\n\nAverage OMV\n\n$47,000\n\nPrice\n\n$258,800 (with COE)\n\nDistributor\n\nMunich Automobiles\n\nTel\n\n6899 6996\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Those LCCs may also attempt to hog the preferred time slots at KLIA2,\" it said in a note recently.\n\nAirAsia X chief executive Azran Osman-Rani, when asked on the issue, said on the sidelines of the Entrepreneurs' Conference TEC2020: \"I think it's best to speak to (AirAsia chief executive officer) Aireen Omar because we're doing this as a group.\"\n\nAirAsia executive chairman Kamarudin Meranun had earlier said the group would, at one point, be moving its commercial flight operations to the new terminal but could not confirm the exact date.\n\n\"What I can confirm is that we will move (to KLIA2) when everything is okay.

Dishes and techniques from the past are almost non-existent. But restaurant manager, Patrick Ng, says they were compelled to recreate traditional cuisine using basic ingredients with the right techniques after often hearing people reminisce about food from the past, and how it tasted better. As such, after months of thorough research and experimentation, Man Fu Yuan will be offering customers \"a taste of nostalgia\".\n\nBut the nostalgia occurs even before the menu-tasting. It begins the moment you step onto the hardwood flooring of the newly refurbished Man Fu Yuan, located in the heart of Bugis, a heritage-rich district, where you are greeted with a combination of Peranakan-inspired louvred windows, rich tapestry and tabletop ceramics - an authentic setting that subconsciously throws you back to the precious golden days governed by rich traditions and strong culture.\n\nThe establishment has a seating capacity of 100 in the main dining room with four private rooms and four semi-private rooms accommodating up to 72 people - catering to business luncheons, family reunions and intimate dinners.\n\nYou are recommended to begin your fond trip down memory lane with the double-boiled winter melon with seafood soup. The clear and delicate soup, light on the palate, comprises prawns, scallops, crabmeat, conpoy and duck steamed and served in a whole winter melon, setting the bar for the rest of the meal up high.\n\nAs a follow-up appetizer, try the Hong Kong style steamed pork belly in shrimp paste. The pork belly is slathered in steamed fermented shrimp paste from Tai-O, a fishing town in Hong Kong, almost synonymous with its iconic shrimp paste, where for years it is prepared traditionally by indigenous methods, producing a strong aromatic flavour that enhances the meat.\n\nDuring its experimentation process, Man Fu Yuan had tried making the dish with a handful of different shrimp paste brands before settling on the current, which most robustly brings out the flavour of the dish, says Mr Ng.\n\nYou may wish to pair your dishes with thoughtfully selected teas, a unique Man Fu Yuan offering. A hot cup of tea is an almost indispensable component of both ancient and modern Chinese cuisine. And Man Fu Yuan acknowledges this fact with its tea-infused menu, which most recently includes a co-creation by Mr Ng and Man Fu Yuan's Chinese executive chef, Kwan Yiu Kwan - the tea-smoked pork belly char siew - pork belly marinated in a combination of Chinese rose wine and barbecue sauce, and prepared by combining Cantonese roasting methods with a Szechuan technique of smoking the char siew, producing flavourful and succulent char siew delicately infused with the smoky aroma of Royal Red Robe tea, and finished off with a mouth-watering maltose glaze.\n\nWith char siew, the meat that you use needs to be sufficiently fatty to ensure that it remains succulent, but eating a lot of fatty meats tends to be a little heavy on the palate, says Chef Kwan. To counter this, Man Fu Yuan concocted a unique method of smoking the meat with tea after it has been barbecued, which adds another dimension to the overall taste.\n\nThe six treasures seafood, another highlight in \"A Taste of Nostalgia\", is a classic throwback to banquets in the '60s, comprising scallops, fish and lobster lightly pan-fried, and topped with crabmeat. The dish comes with deep-fried salted egg yolk, king prawns and braised abalone. Perhaps it had been one of the items at your own wedding banquet dinner, and Man Fu Yuan is offering you the chance to revisit those precious golden memories.\n\nIn many ancient cultures, animal fats were the only way of obtaining oil for cooking and were commonly used. But over time, the introduction of alternative cooking oils has led to a reduction in the use of lard.\n\nNow, lard makes its comeback with Man Fu Yuan's steamed fish head with home-made black bean sauce. The morsels of lard studded onto the dish are a simple addition that is not commonly associated with luxury cuisine, but adds an irreplaceable depth of flavour to the dish.\n\nAt the restaurant, lard is also served with egg noodles. So unique and flavourful is lard that the restaurant wants you to appreciate it fully, with minimal culinary distractions.\n\nAs such, according to Chef Kwan, the restaurant had experimented with different types of noodles, sourced from places such as Thailand and Hong Kong, and tested with different cooking and cooling durations, which affect the overall texture and consistency of the dish - a time-consuming but necessary step in creating the menu - before finally offering duck-egg noodles, served with first-pressed soy sauce and topped with crisp-fried lard.\n\nIt may sound enticing, but you might still find yourself in a bit of a pickle as there are other noodle offerings on the menu with similar history-rich promises, such as traditional wanton noodle, a mainstay in Cantonese cuisine, and flat rice noodles with river prawns drenched in roe-infused sauce.\n\nOther dishes, too, will grab your attention - the mixed beef stew with handmade beef balls and the tender imperial chicken poached in a flavourful broth and served with minced ginger - both bursting with endless potential to recreate unforgettable memories of yesteryear.\n\nMan Fu Yuan\n\nInterContinental Singapore\n\n80 Middle Road, Level 2, Singapore 188966\n\nTel: 6825 1008\n\n6338 7600\n\nEmail:\n\nintercontinental.dining@ihg.com\n\nOpen from 11.45am to 3.30pm for lunch from Monday to Saturday, 11am to 3.30pm on Sunday and Public Holiday, 6.30pm to 10.30pm for dinner\n\nReader's Promotion\n\nComplimentary Tea-smoked Pork Belly Char Siew with minimum $100 spend (usual price: $24).

Through direct sales efforts, along with the help of our dealer partners, we have delivered six new boats in the region, including two boats in Singapore, and we are thrilled with this result.\"\n\nIndeed, the growing wealth in the region has fuelled the demand for luxury items, including yachts. The Wealth-X and UBS World Ultra Wealth Report 2013 released earlier this week showed that there is a growing interest in yachts among the region's 4,690 ultra-wealthy individuals, who have a combined net worth of US$625 billion.\n\nWealth-X chief executive Mykolas Rambus highlighted this at the Asia-Pacific Yachting Conference 2014 here on Tuesday. He pointed out that superyacht owners are generally 30 per cent wealthier than owners of private jets, and that only 7 per cent of luxury asset spending in the region went towards yachting last year versus the global average of 16 per cent.\n\nAlso helping the industry here is the fact that the yachting clients in the region are generally younger than the global average and are receptive to new lifestyle experiences.\n\nMr Treadwell said that with the luxury boat markets in the West slowing down since 2008, companies are now seeking new markets. Since Asia needs one proper boating show to rival that of its Western counterparts, Singapore, with its infrastructure and connectivity, was the obvious choice. He added that even buyers from China come here to purchase their boats.\n\nBT reported last week that Grand Banks has decided to unveil its strongest line-up ever with three new luxury motor boat designs.\n\nSimpson Marine announced their largest display to date at the SYS, including two luxury yachts from Italian-designed yacht brand Monte Carlo Yachts.\n\nPaul Whelan, general manager of Simpson Marine, said: \"We definitely foresee better sales at this year's Singapore Yacht Show with 2014 starting off on a good note. Yacht sales this past year have been upbeat for Simpson Marine with nearly 30 new and used boats sold in the 12 months to January 2014.\"\n\nThe interest is also growing with local companies. Hong Seh Motors, the distributor of Maserati cars in Singapore, has also been distributing Riva boats and Cranchi yachts here. Yesterday, it announced its appointment by the Ferretti Group as the exclusive authorised dealer for Ferretti and Pershing yachts in Singapore. Its new office is strategically located at One\u00b015 Marina Club.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 11, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nFOR a few more dollars over the already competent Golf GTI, the high-performance Golf R promises 60 more horses and four-wheel-drive. $30,000 to be exact. But is it worth the extra cash?\n\nAt first glance, the Volkswagen Golf R looks like a snazzier GTI, with cosmetic differences such as a more distinctive front end and two pairs of chrome tailpipes - a first for the Golf R.\n\nUnder the bonnet is an almost totally re-worked version of the GTI's 2.0-litre turbocharged engine, with a newly designed cylinder head and heavily modified or completely redesigned components. Much work has been done to it so that it is almost a bespoke motorsports unit.\n\nThe end-result is that its 280 hp and 380 Nm has 60 hp and 30 Nm higher than the standard GTI power plant. It is also mated to a six-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox but, unlike the front-wheel-driven GTI, the Golf R has 4Motion permanent all-wheel-drive.\n\nThe R employs a fifth-generation Haldex coupling, which mostly delivers the available torque to the front wheels but is also able to direct about 95 per cent to the rear wheels if necessary.\n\nAs a result of all this torque and traction, the Golf R accelerates from zero to 100 kmh in 5.0 seconds, or significantly speedier than the GTI's 6.5 seconds.\n\nIt helps that at 1,420 kg, this latest incarnation of the R is 46 kg lighter than its predecessor and only 50 kg heavier than the two-wheel-drive GTI.\n\nWith such a healthy power-to-weight ratio, the Golf R is incredibly nimble. Floor the gas pedal and feel the rear end squat as it blasts off with a deliciously muted exhaust burble at each gear change.\n\nIts agility is enhanced by the progressive steering feature, which is standard. This reduces steering effort in tight turns and feels completely natural.\n\nSharper 'turn-in'\n\nAnother driving aid is XDS+, which brakes the inside wheels of both the front and rear axles for a sharper \"turn-in\" when cornering fast.\n\nThe Golf R suspension comes with DCC dynamic chassis control as standard and it rides five mm lower than the GTI, which itself is already 15 mm lower than a standard Golf.\n\nDCC's adaptive dampers work with the Driving Profile Selector to offer five driving modes - Eco, Comfort, Normal, Race and Individual. Race mode is, of course the most extreme, with stiffer damping, increased engine response and delayed shift points.\n\nAll these sound nice on paper but the most visceral effect of Race mode is how alert the sure-footed Golf R becomes. It nips and darts in traffic with ease, always with ample torque bubbling away.\n\nIn sharp turns and sweeping corners, you can put the power down without wheelspin or understeer.\n\nAnd the best part of all is that the R remains completely controllable throughout.\n\nSo is it worth the premium over the GTI? Definitely.\n\nsamuelee@sph.com.sg\n\nThe Volkswagen Golf R is incredibly nimble.

A year ago, when subsidiary TEE Land had yet to be listed, a $52,000 loss was attributed to minority interests.\n\nAlthough cost of sales shrank 33.8 per cent to help turn a 29.5 per cent fall in revenue to $37.4 million into a 6.1 per cent gross profit increase, operating and administrative expenses surged 39 per cent to $6.1 million, which sent operating pre-tax profit back into a 5.1 per cent decline.\n\nFor the nine months ended Feb 28, net profit for TEE fell by 53.7 per cent from a year ago to $3.1 million, despite a 22.4 per cent jump in revenue, because of margin compression and non-controlling interests.\n\nAnalysts said construction companies are feeling the heat from rising costs, and are seen deploying ways to rein in the margin squeeze. Faced with softness in the residential market, some are also hedging the downside by diversifying their business.\n\nDBS analyst Alfie Yeo said he expects higher construction costs as companies now need to invest in better technology to seek more efficient processes and achieve better productivity in the long run.\n\nUnder new rules by the Building and Construction Authority, new projects at selected government land sale (GLS) sites will require the adoption of productive technologies and pre-fabricated components from the second half of this year.\n\n\"Construction margins are likely to compress as contractors grapple with rising labour costs and increasing legislation for pre-fab requirements,\" said OCBC analyst Eli Lee.\n\nHaving benefited from the rebound in the housing market after the last financial crisis, companies like Lian Beng are now looking to diversify their business portfolios into related segments such as worker dormitories, construction materials and commercial property development, Mr Lee observed.\n\nBesides having a greater interest in commercial and industrial projects that provide recurring income, Lian Beng is looking to develop property overseas in China and Cambodia through newly formed joint ventures. It also plans to set up a new pre-mix plant by the end of this year.\n\nConstruction companies like Tiong Seng and Koh Brothers are already ramping up their production of pre-casts. Others are re-calibrating their strategies amid softness in the residential market.\n\n\"We are aware of the ongoing challenges in the real estate market,\" said CK Phua, chief executive and managing director at TEE group.\n\n\"However, we will stay focused on identifying sites that have good potential in realising long-term value for our stakeholders, both locally and regionally.\"\n\nTo help finance its regional expansion, TEE has proposed a bonus issue of up to 197.2 million free warrants - on the basis of two warrants for every five shares - with the right to subscribe for one new share at an exercise price of 25 cents.\n\nTEE group's exposure to the real estate market is mainly through its 70 per cent listed subsidiary TEE Land.\n\nThe group's total order book of about $271 million comprises $196 million from the engineering business in Singapore and the region, and $75 million from its associates' telecommunication engineering and wastewater treatment business in Malaysia and Thailand.\n\nMr Phua said the group is confident of the long-term prospects of the wastewater treatment industry. Having inked a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Guangdong Wanlv Environment Engineering Co Ltd to jointly explore municipal infrastructure and environment projects in Guangdong province, the group hopes to conclude this partnership with an actual transaction in the future, he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Twelve companies recorded 20 purchases worth $6.4 million versus four firms with nine disposals worth $940,000. The number of companies and trades on the buying side were down from the previous week's 15 firms and 29 purchases. The buy value, however, was slightly up at $6.2 million. The sales, on the other hand, were not far off from the previous week's four companies, 10 disposals and $700,000.\n\nBuyback activity was flat with five companies posting 18 repurchases worth $19.3 million. The number of firms and trades were consistent with the previous week's six firms and 18 repurchases. The value, however, was sharply down from the previous week's turnover of $29.1 million.\n\nThere were several significant corporate shareholder trades last week with buybacks in Hotung Investment, insider buys in Megachem and Tye Soon and a director sale in International Healthway Corp. On the funds' side, Keppel Corp, Broadway Industrial and Mapletree Greater China Commercial Trust made purchases.\n\nHotung Investment Hldgs\n\nVenture capital firm Hotung Investment bought back for the first time since July 2013 with 2.414 million shares on April 10 at 16.1 cents each, on the back of the 10 per cent rise in the share price since December 2013 (14.6 cents). The counter is also up since September 2013's 14.2 cents. The group acquired 1.14 million shares (June to July 2013) at an average of 14.8 cents each and 22.6 million shares from April to December 2012 at an average of 14.7 cents each.

Mr Chew purchased 50,000 shares on April 10 at 30 cents each, which increased his direct holdings to 45.842 million shares or 34.39 per cent of the issued capital. He also has deemed interest of 434,296 shares or 0.33 per cent.\n\nMr Chew acquired 26,000 shares on March 27 and 24,000 shares on March 4 at 30 cents each, having acquired 317,000 shares (April to October 2013) at an average of 29.2 cents each and 35,000 shares (October to December 2012) at an average of 26.7 cents each.

The acquisition was made on the back of the 20 per cent drop in the share price since March from 35 cents. Despite the fall in the share price, the counter is still up since October 2013 from 23 cents. He had acquired 454,000 shares (June to July 2013) at an average of 29.3 cents each and 830,000 shares (November 2004 to September 2007) at 15-25 cents each or an average of 19.3 cents each. The stock rose by an average of 11 per cent three months after Mr Tan bought shares based on 11 acquisitions since 2004. The stock recorded a price gain three months after on 73 per cent of those purchases. The counter last closed at 26 cents.\n\nTye Soon Ltd\n\nExecutive director Kelvin Ong Eng Chian recorded his first on-market trade in automotive components and consumer products distributor Tye Soon Ltd since October 2010 with 98,000 shares purchased on April 3 at 18 cents each, increasing his direct holdings by 10 per cent to 1.100 million shares or 0.42 per cent of the issued capital. This was made on the back of the 30 per cent rebound in the share price since January's 13.9 cents. Despite the rebound, the counter is still down since February 2013's 31 cents. In October 2010, he acquired 177,000 shares at 12 cents each and 150,000 shares in May 2009 at 6 cents. Although Mr Ong has recorded only two purchase-related filings in the past, the stock rose by an average of 19 per cent three months after and 17 per cent six months after he bought those shares in 2009 and 2010. The counter closed at 19.3 cents on Friday.\n\nIntl Healthway Corp\n\nNon-executive director Eric Wong Ong Ming recorded his first on-market sale in integrated healthcare services and facilities provider International Healthway Corporation since the stock was listed in July 2013 with 60,000 shares sold on April 7 at 31 cents each. The trade reduced his deemed holdings by 88 per cent to 8,000 shares. He also has direct interest of 31,000 shares or 0.002 per cent of the issued capital. The sale was made on the back of the 16 per cent drop in the share price since November 2013 from 37 cents. The counter is also sharply down since July 2013 from 42.5 cents. The director previously acquired 1,000 shares in July 2013 at 42 cents each. Mr Wong's trade prices were lower than the IPO price of 48 cents. The counter closed at 31 cents on Friday.\n\nKeppel Corp\n\nAberdeen Asset Management resumed its positive track in shipping, property, and infrastructure firm Keppel Corporation after selling shares in February with a purchase-related filing on April 9 of 816,000 shares at $10.98 each.

Prior to that sale, the fund manager reported a purchase-related filing in August 2013 of 90,000 shares at $10.31 each and an initial filing in January 2013 of 438,000 shares at $11.16 each, which raised its interest to 5.02 per cent. Overall, Aberdeen's stake is up by 20 per cent since that initial filing in January 2013. The stock closed at $11.13 on Friday.\n\nBroadway Industrial\n\nDelta Lloyd Asset Management NV recorded its first notice in precision-machined components and foam plastic solutions provider Broadway Industrial since August 2013 with a purchase-related filing on April 7 of 184,000 shares at 26.5 cents each. The trade increased its deemed holdings to 37.610 million shares or 9.03 per cent of the issued capital. The filing was made after the stock rebounded by 18 per cent from 22.5 cents on March 19. The counter is also up since December 2013 from 21.5 cents. The group had reported a purchase-related filing in August 2013 of 100,000 shares at 21.6 cents each, a purchase-related filing in February 2013 of 855,000 shares at 36.1 cents each and an initial filing in November 2011 of 65,000 shares at 33 cents each, which raised its interest to 5.0 per cent. Overall, Delta Lloyd's stake is up by 81 per cent since that initial filing in November 2011. The stock closed at 28.5 cents on Friday.\n\nMapletree Greater China CT\n\nTemasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd recorded its first notice in real estate investment trust in Mapletree Greater China Commercial Trust since March 2013 with a purchase-related filing on April 2 of 200,000 units at 81.5 cents each. This increased its deemed holdings to 912.682 million units or 34.0 per cent of the issued capital.\n\nThe filing was made on the back of the 16 per cent drop in the unit price since September 2013's 96.5 cents and May 2013's $1.14. The group previously reported a purchase-related filing on March 13, 2013, of five million units at $1.05 each. Temasek had initially subscribed for 873.250 million units or 32.8 per cent of the issued capital in the IPO at 93 cents each.\n\nAlso positive this year are chairman Frank Wong Kwong Shing and non-executive directors Hiew Yoon Khong and Chua Tiow Chye. Mr Wong purchased 625,000 units on Feb 7 at 80 cents each, which increased his deemed holdings by 156 per cent to 1.165 million units or 0.04 per cent. Mr Hiew purchased 310,000 units on Feb 17 at 80.5 cents each, which boosted his deemed stake by 17 per cent to 2.180 million units or 0.08 per cent.

For the week, the index lost 14 points or 0.4 per cent.\n\nJardine Cycle & Carriage has been in the limelight for about three weeks now following a query and \"Trade With Caution\" notice issued by the Singapore Exchange (SGX) in mid-March. On Thursday, it crashed 6 per cent after investors were apparently disappointed with the results of the Indonesian elections. Its rebound yesterday - together with the rest of the Jardine group - supported the STI.\n\nThe entire Jardine group, whose listing in Singapore is a secondary one, has been in the news because of question marks over its listing status here once it applies to downgrade its London listing from premium to standard. There are also question marks over its continued inclusion in the STI if it does not have a primary listing elsewhere as this raises governance issues.\n\nIn the penny segment, JES International announced mid-week that it has put on hold a mining project in China and is moving into the African forestry business by buying 51 per cent of Scibois Co Limited, which has a 75 per cent stake in a timber extraction firm.\n\nJES also said that once the second stage of the deal is completed, Scibois will provide a profit guarantee of US$170 million in accumulated net profits before tax in the four years after the acquisition. JES shares fell 4 cents or 31 per cent over the week to 9.1 cents.\n\nElsewhere, IT firm JK Technologies and oil and gas firm AusGroup benefited from deals with oil and gas company Ezion Holdings. JK Tech said it is diversifying into the oil sector thanks to Ezion, which is taking a 29.8 per cent stake in JK Tech. Over the week, JK Tech shares more than trebled from 15 cents to 47 cents.\n\nAusGroup is joining hands with Ezion, which has taken a 6.9 per cent stake in AusGroup via a memorandum of understanding to collaborate in various areas. These include providing logistics supply chain and related support services in Australia.\n\nAusGroup's shares jumped 7.5 cents or 18 per cent over the week to 49 cents, while Ezion's shares lost 5 cents at $2.09.\n\nNot all penny stock movements were upwards though - Blumont Group's shares came under pressure once it announced that its chairman designate, Alexander Molyneux, will not be buying a 5.2 per cent stake at 40 cents per share as was announced last October.\n\nBlumont is one of the nine companies whose senior management is helping the Commercial Affairs Department with investigations into possible breaches of the Securities and Futures Act. The stock once traded above $2 - this week it fell 1.2 cents or 26 per cent to 3.5 cents.\n\nAmong the top percentage gainers and actives yesterday was Cacola Furniture, which was placed on SGX's watch-list in March after reporting three consecutive years of losses. The company has announced a share consolidation exercise - 60 into one - and a deal with a diversified China company with interests in livestock breeding, tourism and property development. Cacola's shares yesterday surged 1.6 cents or 123 per cent to 2.9 cents with 152 million shares traded.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It summarises key inspection results from audits of public companies, including systemically important financial institutions.\n\nIFIAR's report showed that - for inspected audits of listed public interest entities, or public companies - the main areas of deficiency were in auditing fair value measurements, internal control testing, and procedures to assess the adequacy of financial statement presentation and disclosures.\n\nFor the audits of systemically important financial institutions, including global systemically important banks, the key deficiencies were in auditing of allowance for loan losses and loan impairments, internal control testing, and auditing of the valuation of investments and securities.\n\nThese inspection findings are deficiencies in audit procedures that indicate that the audit firm did not obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support its opinion.\n\nIFIAR's report also found that the audit firms' own quality control systems had the highest number of inspection findings in the areas of engagement performance, human resources, and independence and ethics requirements.\n\nThe audit firms covered were the six largest international audit firm networks, ie the Big Four - Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC - as well as BDO and Grant Thornton.\n\n\"The survey makes clear that these important inspection findings are prevalent across many nations and firms,\" Mr Ferguson noted. He added that IFIAR has taken steps to improve global audit quality, including meeting global network audit firm leaders to discuss inspection results and actions the firms will take to show demonstrable improvement in audit performance. It has also used the survey results in members' home countries to inform their respective inspection and standard-setting activities.\n\nOf the global audit firm leaders, Janine van Diggelen, IFIAR vice chair, and head of the Audit & Reporting Quality Division at The Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets, said: \"The firms should develop robust root-cause analysis to gain a clearer understanding of the factors that underlie inspection findings and to take appropriate remedial actions.\n\n\"Only with a thorough understanding of the underlying factors that have led to findings can audit firms take appropriate measures. These measures should be aimed at improving their auditing techniques, as well as their oversight policies and procedures, but also consider the cultural and behavioural influences in the firms that were relevant to the deficiencies. Both audit firms and regulators must do more to improve audit quality.\"\n\nIt was also announced at the Washington meeting that Singapore's Acra has joined IFIAR's Investor and Other Stakeholders Working Group (IWG) that engages investors and other stakeholders with an interest in improving audit quality.\n\nAcra's chief executive, Kenneth Yap, said of the regulator's inclusion: \"It is vital that we ensure audit and audit regulation continue to provide value to investors. We look forward to encouraging greater participation from investors, audit committees and other stakeholders in the drive to improve audit quality.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Debbie Yong meets up with them\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 11, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nShen Tan\n\nUjong\n\n#01-10 Raffles Hotel Arcade\n\n1 Beach Road\n\nOpens end April\n\nA YEAR after her modern-Singaporean restaurant Wok and Barrel closed on Duxton Hill, Shen Tan is back - and she's more passionate about Singaporean flavours than ever.\n\nHer latest restaurant project Ujong will open by month's end in the 90-seater (alfresco tables seat 60) space previously occupied by Empire Cafe in the Raffles Hotel.\n\nPulau Ujong was the name for Singapore in the third century. Ujong means \"the end\" or \"the corner\", quite aptly, as the restaurant is snuggled away in the corner of the hotel facing Raffles City Shopping Centre. According to Ms Tan, Ujong is a return to her roots - in more ways than one. The Raffles Hotel was a place the 41-year-old frequented while growing up as her mother used to work in a travel agency within the hotel. \"It's an honour to be able to cook in such an institution,\" says Ms Tan, who spent her year-long hiatus working on consulting and pop-up dining projects, as well as reading up on the origins of local dishes.\n\nDecked out in vintage wood, glass panels and marble dinner tables from the unit's former tenants, Ujong will be about \"all that represents what Singapore was, is and will be\", adds Ms Tan. Her menu will marry old-school classics with modern interpretations of familiar favourites. Everything will be made from scratch where possible and entirely MSG-free.\n\nFor breakfast, nibble on carrot cake terrine - steamed layers of lap cheong, dried mushroom, lard and shallots and served with sambal and kecap manis on the side - hae bee hiam-stuffed chee cheong fun or kaya sticky buns slathered with home-churned kaya. Or fill up on more substantial bites such as traditional nasi lemak and claypot rice for lunch and dinner. Mains will cost below $20.\n\nExpect a smattering of Wok & Barrel revivals too, including the bak chor mee pasta, chendol and her signature dessert of puloh hitam cake lashed with coconut ice-cream.\n\nSays Ms Tan, who helms Ujong under fast-expanding F&B group Caerus Holdings, which also runs Lady M and restaurant Nuvo, here: \"Being part of a bigger group has helped a lot in terms of resources, I don't have to worry about a lot of things such as our reservations channel or hiring service staff. It gives me more time to concentrate on the kitchen and the food.\"\n\nJean-Philippe Patruno\n\nUna\n\n1 Rochester Park\n\nOpens Monday\n\nBORN to a Spanish mother and an Italian father and raised in the south of France, Jean-Philippe Patruno was once deemed not Spanish enough to cook Spanish food, not Gallic enough for French cuisine and not sufficiently English to plate up British grub, despite his 22 years of living and cooking in London.\n\nWhich is why, when his latest restaurant Una opens next week, instead of limiting himself to a particular cuisine, he intends to send out category-defying plates that bear imprints of his mixed heritage.\n\nSpanish for the number one and Latin for \"coming together\", Una is - fittingly - a fine dining restaurant, tapas bar and wedding venue bundled in one lush venue. It is owned by the One Rochester Group and takes over the black-and-white colonial bungalow formerly occupied by the group's eponymous flagship restaurant.\n\n\"Singapore is a multi-cultural society with people coming from many different backgrounds, like myself,\" says Mr Patruno of his decision to stay on in Singapore even after the closure of Bomba, the Spanish restaurant he helmed under the Epicure group. He moved to Singapore with his wife and two children in 2012 after heading restaurants such as Quo Vadis, Barafina and Fino in London.\n\nBesides crafting \"food made with fine dining-standard ingredients\" - such as Scottish scallops cooked la plancha and served with braised veal cheek - on the smartly decked out 110-seater ground floor of Una, Mr Patruno has also plugged in a 60-seat tapas bar on the building's second floor, to cater to the growing appetite for small plates. Both venues can be booked separately for private events.\n\nAccordingly, six signature concoctions stirring in regional spirits such as French pastis, Spanish sherry and Italian campari and grappa front the cocktail list, while beers and wines will be sourced from the three countries too.\n\nSays the 43-year-old chef who has been cooking since he was 14: \"I wanted to work with someone who has a long-term vision, not just to open a restaurant for the next six months to a year, but for the next five years or more. And One Rochester has that kind of vision.\" Blueprints for further projects with the group are still being sketched, he hints.\n\nChung Ho Shi\n\nRoyal Pavilion\n\nPark Regis Hotel\n\n23 Merchant Road\n\nEVEN at the age of 62, head chef of two-month-old Royal Pavilion restaurant Chung Ho Shi believes there's still plenty for him to learn in the kitchen.\n\nSo, when the opportunity came for him to head to Shanghai to helm the Spectrum Chinese Restaurant in the Millennium HongQiao Hotel in 2009, he jumped at it.\n\nNever mind if the Hong Kong native then held the enviable title of executive chef at the Golden Peony in the Conrad Centennial Singapore, one of the better regarded Cantonese restaurants in town. Mr Chung, who had been working there for nine years, recalls: \"I felt that it was a good opportunity to broaden my horizon and experience. I could bring my knowledge to the emergent market and at the same time obtain new experiences.\"\n\nHis overseas posting also gave his team at the Golden Peony a chance at promotion within the kitchen, he adds.\n\nHe returned to Singapore last year to set up Royal Pavilion with the Park Regis Hotel group, where he now heads the culinary team of more than 20 chefs.\n\nBesides signature dishes that have stayed with him throughout the years, such as the baked spare ribs wrapped with bacon, and baked fillet of cod with teriyaki honey sauce, the menu at Royal Pavilion also folds in new cooking insights gleaned from Mr Chung's stint abroad, such as the bold use of curious new ingredients such as the macalan root in his double-boiled soup with fish maw, or the use of vinegar as a marinade in his shredded jellyfish with garlic vinaigrette.\n\nTo suit diners seeking the clean flavours of traditional Cantonese cooking, all dishes are prepared with minimal salt and oil and contain no preservatives or artificial colouring.\n\nVictor Caballe Molina\n\nThe Study\n\n49 Keong Saik Road\n\nTHE saying that when one door closes, another one opens may be an old line for some, but for The Study's new head chef Victor Caballe Molina, it is a happy cliche.\n\nThe Barcelona native not only swiftly landed himself a new job after his previous employers wound down their Singapore restaurant in January, he also checked off a major item on his bucket list too.\n\n\"I always wanted to be a head chef one day, and now I've become one earlier than I expected,\" says the 30-year-old who moved to Singapore in 2012 as the sous chef of defunct Spanish restaurant Bomba. Prior to that, he spent six years working in top London restaurants such as Newman Street Tavern, The Penthouse and Quo Vadis, where he met Bomba head chef Jean-Philippe Patruno, who offered him the posting to Singapore.\n\nIt was also during his time in London that he met The Study's executive chef Andrew Walsh, who was a regular diner in his restaurant and subsequently got him to join The Study.\n\n\"I'm learning a lot about menu costings. I'm a lot busier than before but also much happier,\" says Mr Caballe Molina, who had to hire his kitchen team of six entirely from scratch over two weeks. \"Even after working for 15 hours, I can take a long cycle home and feel great about my day.\"\n\nBesides assisting in the rebranding of the 30-seater space from gourmet comfort food joint Keong Saik Snacks to the casual, British-inspired The Study earlier this year, Mr Caballe Molina has also fashioned a new menu by offering twists on classic British dishes such as the fried snapper served with duck fat chips and grilled lamp chops served with shepherd's pie.\n\nAn expansion of the brunch menu to include family-friendly fodder such as French toast, pancakes and yoghurt muesli will be rolled out next month.\n\nDaniele Sperindio\n\nOpen Door Policy\n\n19 Yong Siak Street\n\nOPEN Door Policy (ODP) may be your trendy neighbourhood bistro, but the technique and thought that goes into its food is of the same standard of that applied at progressive restaurant, The Tippling Club.\n\nThat, according to new head chef Daniele Sperindio, was exactly what drew him to the job. The 27-year-old native of Genoa in Italy clocked time in casual and semi-fine dining Italian restaurants in Paris, Monte Carlo and Miami before moving to Singapore to take up the post of sous chef at Italian restaurant Alkaff Mansion in 2012 and later, as the Da Paolo Group's executive chef and restaurant manager.\n\nStill, he was hankering to try his hand at something beyond the Italian cuisine he grew up with, so he knocked on The Tippling Club's door earlier this year and was offered the head chef position at ODP in January.\n\nThree months in, he's already whipped up a fresh new menu reboot at ODP by fusing Asian spices with his Italian roots and Tippling Club chef-owner Ryan Clift's Australian flair.\n\n\"Now I get to use all the ingredients that could never be used in a traditional Italian restaurant,\" he reveals with a boyish grin, such as freshly grated wasabi or the coiff of green mango salad that sits atop his slow-braised red curry shortribs.\n\nFrom a single pasta dish before, the new menu currently features home-made pastas such as sweet potato gnocchi served with iberico pork belly and chorizo-filled tortelli, along with two stunning risottos made with beetroot and feta cheese or confit calamari and poached pear.\n\n\"But we don't want to be too Italian - this is not an Italian restaurant,\" he says.\n\nSufian Zain\n\nEmber\n\n50 Keong Saik Road\n\nSTARTING a restaurant from scratch is a logistical nightmare in these labour-strapped and rent-inflated times, so getting on board a steady sailing industry stalwart was a no-brainer for chef Sufian Zain.\n\nNever mind if Ember is practically synonymous with outgoing chef-owner Sebastian Ng, who has been with the restaurant since it was first founded in 2002. Mr Sufian isn't daunted.\n\nThe 36-year-old Shatec-trained chef spent the last month training in the cold and hot sections of the kitchen under Mr Ng and will fully take over the reins when the latter leaves at the end of the month.\n\nMr Sufian, after all, is no lightweight on the cooking front. After starting his career as a commis cook in Les Amis, he held stints at The Cliff and now-defunct Amuse Bouche before joining Iggy's in 2004, where he worked his way up to executive chef. He was later one of three executive sous chefs who led the opening team of Australian celebrity chef Tetsuya Wakuda's Waku Ghin restaurant at the Marina Bay Sands, which he left earlier this year to join Ember.\n\nSays the soft-spoken chef of Ember's stove burners: \"Working at Ember reminds me of my early days working at Les Amis. At Waku Ghin, everything was spacious and modern, like its induction ovens, but I like to perspire over the stove in an 'old school' kitchen through a busy service - you get a greater sense of satisfaction.\"\n\nAs for whether he will get the freedom to create a name for himself, Mr Sufian believes this is something that will come in time - and gradually.\n\nTo not abruptly rock the boat, Mr Ng's signature dishes such as the roasted pork belly and duck breast will be kept on the menu, while Mr Sufian's new creations - similarly Asian-tinged European dishes such as the scallop carpaccio dressed with rice wine vinegar, daikon and rocket he's been tinkering with - will be first introduced as lunch specials before a menu revamp around mid-year.\n\n\"Besides the challenge of trying to keep Sebastian's regular followers happy, my goal is to attract a pool of new customers in too,\" says Mr Sufian.\n\nToni Robertson\n\nMandarin Oriental Singapore\n\n5 Raffles Avenue\n\nRARE is the female executive chef in Singapore, rarer still one who heads up the kitchens at one of Singapore's leading five-star hotels. But the Mandarin Oriental's new executive chef Toni Robertson is taking it coolly in her stride.\n\n\"I've never considered myself to be a 'female chef', just a chef. That has been my coping mechanism throughout my career and it has worked very well for me. I simply do not allow that distinction to be made internally,\" says the Mandalay-born American in her late 50s.\n\nIn fact, she's done it all before. Raised in the United States, where she migrated to as a teenager, Ms Robertson made her Asian homecoming in the 1990s as the executive chef of Pan Pacific Hotel in Singapore, where she helped to open now-defunct Tuscany Ristorante.\n\n\"There were no female chefs heading major F&B programmes here then. I was the first. I always joked that they probably thought 'Toni' was actually a 6 ft tall Italian guy when they hired me,\" she quips. Physical stature regardless, her resume will tell you that she is anything but a pushover.\n\nAfter eight years in the US Air Force as a medic assigned to emergency rooms, she spent a further five years in the National Guard, during which she was offered a posting to Germany. It gave her a base to travel and eat extensively through the food capitals of Europe.\n\n\"I would come home and try to duplicate what I had eaten in those wonderful restaurants. On the weekends, I would cook at home for friends, other airmen who would otherwise have been eating in a mess hall,\" she recalls. \"I would not be the successful chef I am today without the discipline and leadership skills I learned in the military.\"\n\nYet she is no drill sergeant in the kitchen, she disclaims. \"I'm 5' 2\" tall, female and Asian. Nobody is going to mistake me for 'fierce' and that truly is not my management style. I try to lead by example,\" she says.\n\nAt the Mandarin Oriental, besides more immediate plans such as working on the revamp of the hotel's Italian restaurant Dolce Vita to focus on more classical and upscale cuisine, and building an artisan food supply chain of independent organic farmers and local fishmongers to obtain better ingredients for the hotel, two other causes close to her heart are creating an Asian identity and offering internship programmes, scholarships and seminars to attract more women to the industry.\n\n\"We do not want to just duplicate what we see in Australia, London or New York. We want to offer that standard but retain elements of our Asian identity that make us unique in our own right,\" she says.\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was due in part to a weaker-than-expected performance from its offshore support services business and the absence of one-off gains of US$30 million last year from sale of assets, the oilfield services company said yesterday.\n\nRevenue rose 22 per cent to US$300.4 million, largely due to an increase in revenue at its subsea services division, EMAS AMC. But this was partially offset by a decrease of US$6.2 million in revenue from its offshore support services division, EMAS Marine, which also saw weaker gross profit margins.\n\n\"In terms of the offshore services division, there were a couple of factors that affected its gross margins,\" said Eugene Cheng, Ezra group chief financial officer. \"One is that there was an increase in operating costs because of higher than expected maintenance costs, and secondly, there was weaker utilisation of the smaller vessels of the OSV (offshore support vessel) segment.\"\n\nTo boost its offshore services segment, Ezra unveiled a new senior management team at EMAS Marine. Bennett Neo and Mike Wallace joined as CEO and chief operating officer, respectively, at the beginning of 2014.\n\n\"We feel that we finally have a good team together again,\" said Ezra group CEO and managing director Lionel Lee, \"and we should not have the issues that we had in the last year. So we have finally been turning things around for (EMAS) Marine.\"\n\nThe subsea business has contributed significantly to group revenue over the last three months and chalked up three consecutive quarters of operational profitability. Ezra said that it expected to earn more from this division as its flagship vessel, the Lewek Constellation, would head to West Africa for its first project next quarter.\n\nThe group also said that it had received a letter of agreement from Noble Energy for the vessel to install pipelines for its Gunflint Project in the Gulf of Mexico next year.\n\nThe group has secured more than US$300 million of subsea projects since the beginning of this year, with the subsea backlog standing at more than US$1.4 billion to date. Ezra's order book stands at more than US$2 billion, the bulk of which is expected to be executed over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nFor the six months ended Feb 28, net profit declined 29 per cent to US$25.9 million, while revenue increased 22 per cent to US$640.3 million. The group earned 2.66 US cents per share for the half year.\n\nIn the stock market yesterday, the counter closed half a cent lower at $1.07.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These declines offset revenue increases in SPH's other business segments. Property revenue rose 3 per cent year on year to $51.7 million, thanks to higher rental income and full occupancy rates for the retail assets under SPH Reit - Paragon and The Clementi Mall. Boosted by contributions from the exhibitions, online classified and radio businesses, revenue from the group's \"other businesses\" doubled to $15.4 million.\n\nBut SPH said that its newspapers and magazines arm is implementing initiatives that will yield annual savings of $19 million when completed. These initiatives also enabled the group to contain its operating costs in the quarter, SPH said.\n\nFor instance, to raise efficiency and reduce printing costs, the group removed one press-line. But this meant a one-off impairment charge of $9.9 million.\n\nThis one-off charge and an 18.2 per cent increase in staff costs, caused total costs to rise 13.7 per cent to $228.3 million in the quarter. Staff costs rose as a result of higher bonuses, including a one-off special bonus for the prior year, arising from the Reit's profit, as well as an incentive to drive growth.\n\nSPH has said that a total of 300 positions would be eliminated over time, as a result of an extensive organisation review to sustain the core print business. The group has strengthened its digital capabilities with the formation of a digital division, and another focusing on digital media strategy and analytics. Seventy new positions have been created as a result.\n\n\"Having completed our organisational review, the group is now embarking on its transformation from a position of strength. With a leaner and more agile organisational structure in place, the group is well placed to respond to rapid changes in the media industry and structural shifts in consumer behaviour, and to pursue growth opportunities,\" said SPH chief executive officer Alan Chan.\n\nFor the half year, net profit dipped 0.4 per cent to $170.1 million. Operating revenue edged up 0.5 per cent to $607.2 million.\n\nEarnings per share were five cents for Q2 and 11 cents for the half year, both unchanged from the corresponding periods a year earlier.\n\nNet asset value per share was $2.17 as at end-February, down from $2.19 at Aug 31, 2013.\n\nSPH has declared an interim dividend of seven cents a share, unchanged from a year earlier, which will be paid on May 23.\n\nSPH shares closed flat at $4.22 yesterday, before the results were announced.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its Bluetooth-controlled Edifice watch connects to smartphones, and can adjust to time changes as smoothly as the device in your pocket; its new G-Shock model can synchronise with the time signals broadcast by radio stations or satellites.\n\nHarald Schroeder, Casio Europe's head of marketing, told AFP: \"We expect huge demand because people nowadays look for this technology more and more, so we are very confident.\"\n\nAsian tech giants such as Samsung, Sony and Huawei have also unveiled new connected timepieces in recent months.\n\nThe Swatch Group teamed up with Microsoft a decade ago to produce Paparazzi - what it claimed was the pioneer of smartwatches. It proved to be a flop.\n\nSwatch's chief executive Nick Hayek told reporters recently that smartwatches raise more problems than mechanical timepieces. These include their limited battery life and the fact that they are \"trackable\" by the National Security Agency and other intelligence services.\n\n\"People don't want these complications,\" he added.\n\nStill, TAG Heuer's Mr Linder sees reason to keep an eye on developments, because the technology has the power to reshuffle the deck - just as Apple did when it dethroned the reining mobile phone companies with its iPhone.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/heavy-metal", "site_title": "Heavy metal", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nHeavy metal\n\nNew gold and platinum timepieces vied for attention at Baselworld 2014, where watch lovers also found standouts crafted out of stainless steel, ceramic, and titanium. Chuang Peck Ming reports.\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 11, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHERE was enough gold on display to light up the dark halls of Baselworld 2014 last week - almost blinding the record 150,000 visitors at the world's biggest watch and jewellery show. So it was pretty smart of Patek Philippe to steal the show with an alternative display of steel timepieces at this annual fair, where about 80 per cent of global sales are sealed.\n\nThe two steel watches launched - Annual Calendar Chronograph and Nautilus Travel Time Chronograph - backed by the Patek Philippe pedigree, were among the key exhibits that stood out in a sea of gold and platinum timepieces at the week-long exhibition, held since 1917 in the Swiss city of Basel.\n\nAll of the 1,500 exhibitors from over 40 countries - dominated by the Swiss, of course - had plenty of new watches in precious metals to show off this year. Rolex's star piece was an updated version of its red and blue GMT-Master II which first appeared in 1955 in steel. The new version of the travel timepiece, fitted with the ceramic bezel Rolex has put on all its sports watches since 2005, is in white gold.\n\nChopard made much of the fact that its new L.U.C. Tourbillon Fairmined is created entirely from \"Fairmined\" gold. Small miners produce this gold in ways friendly to the environment - and miners are paid fairly. Yet apart from the positive spin given to it, Fairmined gold is no different from conventional gold.\n\nPlatinum also made a big showing at Baselworld 2014. Omega, which rarely launches new models in this noble metal, has a platinum version of not one but two novelties in its extensive offerings this year - the Seamaster 300 Master Co-Axial and the Seamaster Planet Ocean Orange. The Seamaster 300 is among the first to be powered by Omega's breakthrough anti-magnetic movement, which is to be fitted in all Omega watches by 2019.\n\nBreguet, which shares with Omega the same parent - the giant Swiss Swatch group - took its invention, the gravity-defying tourbillon, to a higher level with the Classique Tourbillon Extra-Plat Automatique 5377. This is the world's slimmest automatic tourbillon - 7.0mm thick - and, fittingly, has a platinum case because it's Breguet's 2014 pride and joy.\n\nBulgari, in an aggressive push for its Octo line, claims the title for thinnest hand-wound tourbillon with the Octo Finissimo Tourbillon, a flying tourbillon that's only 5.0mm thick - and in platinum.\n\nOther notables in platinum at Baselworld 2014 include independent watchmaker De Bethune's futuristic Dream Watch; Glashutte Original's Senator Chronograph Panorama Date; and Ulysse Nardin's Jazz Minute Repeater.\n\nShowcased at Baselworld 2014 were also many timepieces in materials other than gold or platinum. Omega's limited edition Speedmaster Professional \"Moonwatch\", marking the 45th anniversary of the 1969 moon-landing, is a titanium version of the watch which the astronauts wore on that historic occasion.\n\nTAG Heuer celebrated the 10th anniversary of its Monaco V4 - a watch powered by the world's first belt-driven movement - with the Monaco V4 Tourbillon, an avant garde timepiece that is the world's first tourbillon to be driven by micro belts. Its case is made from space-grade black titanium.\n\nAt Blancpain, another Swatch brand, chief executive Marc Hayek (also CEO of Breguet and Jaquet Droz) liked to show visitors the black ceramic variation of the new Fifty Fathoms Bathyscaphe Chronographe, a flyback chronograph that succeeds last year's Fifty Fathoms Bathyscaphe which remembers the 60th anniversary of the brand's iconic diving watch.\n\nBut while titanium and ceramic are increasingly used in watchmaking, they are, unlike gold and platinum, still high-tech materials that can turn out to be more interesting. Rolex has done what it claims to be the impossible by creating a blue and red ceramic bezel for the GMT Master II. Omega has similarly produced an orange ceramic bezel for the Seamaster Planet Ocean Orange.\n\nSteel is more common than gold and platinum in watches, but that's true only for watch brands at lower price points. Longines' new commemorative Conquest Heritage 1954-2014 in steel is priced at just $2,390. You don't find an equivalent at that price among brands like Omega, Patek or Rolex.\n\nThe two new steel Pateks are priced around $70,000 each. And they will be in demand despite the stiff prices.\n\n\"Steel and complications are a rare combination in Patek Philippe's collection, so this is raising a lot of interest,\" Patek's president Thierry Stern explains.\n\nThe Annual Calendar Chronograph will be also Patek's first annual calendar chronograph with a steel bracelet, while the Nautilus Travel Time Chronograph is the most complicated timepiece in the iconic Nautilus line - and you can't get that in gold or platinum.\n\npeckming@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 11, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nHEDRICK Kwan is like the magazine article you read at the hairdresser's about green living come to life. While you go home and make dinner out of meticulously cut carrot stars and shaved asparagus, he's taking the trimmings you would normally throw out and turning them into vegetable stock.\n\nIf you say you don't know how to do that, he'll tell you. One part vegetable peels and one part water; boil over the lowest fire for two hours; filter and freeze to use anytime.\n\n\"The stock is tasty and the vegetable bits that are technically still edible do not go to waste,\" says Mr Kwan, who runs Plantvisionz, a gardening business.\n\nEven then, the trimmings are not thrown away after cooking. Mr Kwan uses them as fertiliser for his clients' gardens.\n\nHis pet guinea pig's poop does not get thrown out either. Mr Kwan uses it to fertilise his vegetable garden filled with rocket, kailan and mizuna. It doesn't end there. The coffee grounds from his morning brew also give his vegetables a varied diet, along with the shells of bean sprouts. \"It is all natural fertilizer,\" he says. His vegetables are grown in plastic containers from Ikea, and hung just outside the kitchen window.\n\nAnd when he is unable to use the poop as fertilizer for his vegetables, because there is just so much he can grow at a time, he throws them near bushes in public spaces: \"It is free fertilizer for the plants,\" he quips.\n\nMost people reuse old newspapers, but Mr Kwan goes a step further. Rather than dumping past assessment papers belonging to his sons into the recycling bin, they are used to line the family cat's litter box.\n\nInstead of splashing out on fancy storage containers, he reuses empty plastic bottles to store legumes and spices. \"Why spend money on buying Tupperware when these are just as good,\" he says.\n\nMr Kwan, 37, says he has been 'green' since his university days, where he studied production horticulture at the University of Queensland. Plants and living greens have always been his passion.\n\nHis lifestyle of living sustainably extends even to his apparel. \"Nearly 80 per cent of my clothes are second hand pieces,\" says Mr Kwan, who shops at flea markets, thrift stores, and online second hand goods sites such as Gumtree and Carousell. \"The pieces are often still of good quality and I am getting them at a steal.\"\n\nHis two young sons wear hand me downs, and their toys are also second hand. \"Some of the items that they have outgrown, such as bathtubs, are later given away to other people who may need them more,\" says Mr Kwan.\n\nBesides running his business, Mr Kwan is currently working with Dunman High Students on foraging. \"It is about going back to prehistoric days, when people foraged for food, before agriculture came about,\" he says.\n\nHe takes the students to forage through the school compound searching for edible food. \"We have found about five species of edible weeds,\" says Mr Kwan. \"For now, we are just doing a survey of what we can find, and later we will decide how best they can be consumed.\" He plans to bring the students out of school to East Coast Park, and to areas along the Green Corridor, such as at Bukit Gombak and Kranji to forage. Mr Kwan also intends to write a book on edible weeds of Singapore.\n\nThrough his business, Mr Kwan encourages other homeowners to grow their own food. He does this by selling wall planters, which come in a hard box container or fabric form.\n\n\"Both are mounted on the walls, which means you don't need any land space, or a large amount of space for that matter,\" he says.\n\n\"The planters look aesthetically pleasing and they are easy to maintain too.\"\n\nHe also advises clients on what types of vegetables to grow, such as sweet potato leaves, rosemary, eggplant and even tomatoes, and how to keep them alive. Those who don't want vegetables growing on their walls can opt for table sprouters that Mr Kwan sells. All it takes is to throw some legumes into the container with water, and the sprouts will start growing.\n\nMr Kwan says he practices green living because \"I see it as part of who I am - I love recycling of organic matter and to stretch my dollars, most importantly.\"\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nReduce, re-use, recycle, refuse\n\nWHENEVER Tan Hang Chong orders a drink at a cafe, kopitiam or fast food restaurant, he always watches the guy behind the counter very closely. Not that the environmental educator is afraid that his drinks may be spiked. He just wants to make sure the server doesn't put a straw in his drink.\n\n\"I refuse to use drinking straws,\" he says. \"It's not an easy habit to apply because most service staff never fail to put a straw into the drink.\"\n\nShould his drink still come with a straw, Mr Tan will accept it, but whenever he can, he stops the staff from doing so. \"Some think I am queer,\" says Mr Tan, 41. \"I explain to them why I don't need one - it is simply not environmentally friendly.\" He has no qualms about drinking from a cup, since not many do that now. \"Everyone should be able to drink directly from a cup.\"\n\nWhen it comes to green practices, most people Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. But Mr Tan has an additional 'R' which he practises - Refuse. \"I refuse to take things that I don't need,\" he explains.\n\nJunk mail fliers are something that he does not need either, so he informs Singpost not to deposit them into his mailbox.\n\nMr Tan tries to live a zero waste life. For example, he bring his own bags when he goes shopping. \"I try to eat with my hands whenever possible, otherwise, I'll bring my own cutlery,\" he says. \"I always carry my own bottle of water with me.\"\n\nWhenever he can, he will swirl some water over his plates and drink up the water, so that there will be less cleaning to be done. \"It is about reducing wastage at the highest level,\" he says.\n\nWhen it comes to ordering food, he orders just enough. \"Get the appropriate serving size, and don't over order so as not to waste food,\" he says.\n\nMr Tan does away with not just the air-conditioning when at bedtime, but even the fan as well. And forget hot showers, cold showers are the way to go for him, \"maybe it is because I'm cold-blooded\", he jokes.\n\nThe Assistant Honorary Secretary of the Nature Society (Singapore) says being a boy scout for 10 years influenced his passion for sustainable living. \"I learnt how I should leave the world a better place than when I first came into it,\" says Mr Tan, who naturally doesn't believe in changing gadgets to keep up with technology, but is happy to use a recycled phone.\n\nAnd it was also during geography lessons in school that he learnt about sustainability. \"I was already green even when it wasn't the in thing yet,\" he says.\n\nBeing green he says has to be habit forming, so he suggests taking small steps. \"This can be as easy as choosing to take public transport more often instead of driving,\" he says. \"Or if you are moving around in the neighbourhood, why not cycle?\"\n\nRather than wash a small load of laundry, he washes his clothes only when there is a full load. Mr Tan also practises bulk buying. \"But only bulk buy things that you need, and not just because it is cheaper.\"\n\nStudies have shown that raising animals for food requires massive amounts of land, food, energy, and water. Armed with this knowledge, Mr Tan has decided to cut down on his consumption of meat. \"I call myself a social omnivore,\" he says. When he is dining on his own, he goes vegetarian. \"But during meals with other people, and instead of inconveniencing everyone, I will eat meat, but only as a last resort.\"\n\nSingapore, he feels, still has some way to go when it comes to sustainable living. His pet peeve: littering. \"When people don't care about the impact of littering, they are unlikely to care about other bigger environmental issues,\" says Mr Tan.\n\nHe doesn't hesitate to remind anyone who he sees littering to pick up what they have left behind. But rather than take the confrontational approach, he crafts his message carefully. \"I assume they may have dropped something by accident, and hope they kick the bad habit out of embarrassment.\"\n\nOther areas where Singaporeans could do with improvement include more knowledge about food wastage, and dealing with household toxic wastes, such as the proper way to discard batteries, and paint.\n\nHis job involves nature guiding and it is during these sessions that he also spreads the sustainable living message.\n\n\"In leading by example, others have also started green practices,\" he says. \"My goal isn't to change the world, but to know that I have followed my values.\"\n\nMaking her own\n\nAMONG her friends, Militza Maury is known as the woman who makes her own, rather than buy off the shelf.\n\nWhat does she make? Anything from body creams, to facial scrubs, bath teas, household cleaners and even her own version of Play-Doh.\n\nMs Maury mixes flour, water, salt, cream of tartar and cooking oil in a saucepan, then cooks it over low heat until it all clumps into a ball. To give the play-dough some colour, she mixes beetroot powder, spinach powder and cocoa powder into the dough.\n\nHer daughters, Maria, six and Meabh, three, know that when they want some play-dough, they have to make their own.\n\nThe 35-year-old is the founder of Little Green Dot, www.ourlittlegreendot.com, a website where she shares her experiences about cutting out excess and simplifying her life. She started her website two years ago, but her switch to a more sustainable lifestyle began four years ago.\n\nThe doting mum was caring for Maria and was on the hunt for natural baby care products and organic baby food. \"Some of the things I wanted to use for my baby were not available in Singapore, or they were way too expensive,\" says Ms Maury.\n\nSince she couldn't buy them, she decided to make them. The first thing she made was a bath tea, using half a cup of loose herbs and a cup of boiling water. The herbs are allowed to steep in the hot water for 15 minutes before pouring the tea into the bath. Ms Maury recommends using chamomile tea for a relaxing bath, or white tea to help detoxify skin.\n\nSeeing how she could make her own baths rather than buy off the shelf, she began studying product labels to see what she could recreate in her kitchen.\n\n\"Often consumers are paying a fortune for regular products, but by making your own, it is less costly and you know what goes into it,\" she says.\n\nMaking her own products is also her way of cutting out excess. Ms Maury recalls that her bathroom used to be filled with half-empty bottles of products, but that is no longer the case, as she makes what she needs and she knows what works best for her skin. \"There is minimal stuff now,\" she says.\n\nThe family no longer uses chemical cleaners in the home. Instead, Ms Maury uses a simple mixture of vinegar and water, and some essential oil to create her own household cleaner.\n\nShe adds that there is a lot of joy and fulfilment in making her own products to use at home. The website was started as a way for her to share her detailed, east-to-follow recipes with anyone who is interested.\n\nWhile she has mastered making her own beauty and household products, Ms Maury now wants to venture more into food, such as learning how to make her own breads and jams.\n\n\"By making bread on my own, it helps me connect with the things that I need. There is more respect for food, and less excess or wastage,\" she says. Also in the pipeline are plans to learn composting and to start her own edible garden.\n\nShe says that living green took a lot of effort in the early days. She cites how she would constantly forget to bring her own bag when out shopping. But when she began making things on her own, her perspective to sustainable living change, and being green became natural to her.\n\nMs Maury also conducts a workshop called Green Living, where participants look at everyday conventional products used in the home and find safer and more natural alternatives.\n\nTo help others jump on the green bandwagon, her website lists a directory of shops which offer green products.\n\nShe plans to build up this directory, and to work with businesses on how they can better connect with consumers. The plan is for each business to have its own page on her website, which will carry product information and recipes.\n\nGarbage enzymes\n\nSTEP into housewife Hope Yang's home off Yio Chu Kang Road, and you will notice large plastic containers with bits of vegetable ends floating in liquids of various colours. Those strange-looking bottles are Ms Yang's way of living naturally.\n\nSome of the bottles contain what she calls garbage enzymes. She learnt how to make them back in 2009, after hearing about them at a dinner party.\n\nTo make a batch of garbage enzymes, she mixes a litre of tap water with 100g of brown sugar, then throws in 300g of fruit and vegetables, anything from the core of a pear to the top ends of a radish, and even the seeds from a capsicum.\n\nThe mixture is stored in a plastic container and left aside for three months to ferment. She recommends using a bigger plastic container over a small one as gas will build up over time during fermentation. After three months, she strains the liquid into a clean container. Ms Yang emphasises that all utensils and ingredients used must be clean, otherwise the batch of enzymes will be contaminated.\n\n\"The enzyme will smell a little sour, which is fine. But if it smells like trash, you should bin it,\" she says. The colour of the enzyme will vary depending on the type of scraps thrown in.\n\nMs Yang, 60, mixes the enzyme into her hand soap and shampoo - one part garbage enzyme, to one part hand soap or shampoo and 10 parts water. \"After using it several times, I find that my hands have become softer and there is less dead skin to scrub away when I go for my manicures. My home-made soaps and shampoos are definitely kinder to the skin.\"\n\nShe also uses the garbage enzyme for cleaning the floor. She adds one to two tablespoons of garbage enzyme to a pail of water. \"Let the mixture stand for 15 minutes before use. This allows the enzyme to work into the water molecules for better effectiveness,\" she says, adding that she has cut down a lot on the use of chemical cleaners.\n\nMaking garbage enzymes is her way of using up food scraps. But she does take it a step further. \"After fermentation, the vegetable scraps are not thrown away, but I bury them in the soil, and they help my plants grow better too,\" she says. And she uses only recycled containers for her garbage enzymes.\n\nOver the last three years, she has taught many friends to make garbage enzymes. While she has the garbage enzyme recipe down pat, Ms Yang is now experimenting with fermenting rice water.\n\nInstead of throwing away the water that is used to wash rice, she stores the water in a container, and keeps it for at least three days. The fermented rice water, together with unwanted filtered coffee grounds, are fed to her plants. The natural fertiliser seems to be doing wonders. Pointing to a chiku tree outside her home, Ms Yang says it is twice the size of another tree nearby. \"There's no need for chemical fertilisers when what's usually thrown out works just as well,\" she says.\n\nMs Yang is also experimenting with another use for the fermented rice water, by using it on her hair. The method is practised by the Yao minority ethnic women from Huangluo Village, in Guangxi Province, who have extraordinarily long black hair even in their senior years.\n\nAfter shampooing her hair, Ms Yang dip a sponge into the fermented rice water, then applies it over her hair. No rinsing is needed after that. Since experimenting for a month, she has noticed that she has less grey hair, and her hair is stronger.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That growth will come,\" he said.\n\nThe prize, however, lies not in the smartphone but the data that a user consumes through it. Now, about 28 per cent of the associates' users subscribe to data services. Mr Chong expects this to grow to 35 per cent by the end of SingTel's financial year.\n\nThe SingTel-Samsung partnership has been forged at a time when SingTel's associates are rolling out their respective 3G networks across the region, while smartphones have never before been so cheap - hardly a coincidence. Samsung, in particular, is notable for its phones that span almost the entire spectrum of affordability and pocket size requirements.\n\nPaul O'Sullivan, CEO, Group Consumer, SingTel, yesterday called this culmination of factors a \"pivotal moment\".\n\n\"For many of these people, that will be their first-ever access to the Internet,\" he said.\n\n\"When you give somebody a new piece of technology, you have an opportunity to persuade them to change an old habit and swap it for a new one . . . we want to give people a reason to start using data.\"\n\nIn Singapore and Australia, where mobile usage has matured, the markets' sophistication has brought a different set of issues. In these two markets, the largest source of growth on the network for SingTel comes from video usage, said Mr O'Sullivan.\n\nFor SingTel, this means using analytics to run \"smarter networks\" to keep up its end of the bargain where customer experience is concerned, he said.\n\nAt the same time, the sheer number of things that users now expect to be possible with a smartphone means that SingTel will have to reinvent a lot of its dealings with customers.\n\nSome of this - termed a \"digitisation\" of its business - is already under way through apps that allow users to control their roaming data usage overseas, for example. \"You are going to see more of that over the next few years . . . our goal would be to allow you to do many of the functions off the screen that you have to call a call centre for today,\" Mr O'Sullivan said.\n\nAlthough rarely seen together in public, the CEOs of SingTel's regional associates frequently collaborate. In the coming years they will look at customer analytics, creating digital content and global partnerships, among other things. Next week, they will hold one of their many meetings in Beijing to discuss cooperation - doubtless a process too important to be \"digitised\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Part of the payment will depend on the Sydney-based Palm Beach's FY2014 and FY2015 performances.\n\nThe transaction is subject to Grand Banks shareholders' approval. Assuming all conditions are met, Grand Banks will issue Mr Richards 11.03 million new shares at S$0.2126 each, which he must hold for at least two years from completion of the transaction. This will give him a 6 per cent stake in Grand Banks' enlarged share capital (from 173 million shares to 184.03 million).\n\nGrand Banks said the transaction would strengthen its position as a global company with two world-class brands that are well represented in the leading markets of North America, Australia, Asia and Europe.\n\nThe acquisition could also strategically help Grand Banks with its current problems - it has been placed on SGX's watch-list since December 2011 and was told that it had to have $40 million in market capitalisation and achieve pre-tax profits within a two-year deadline or face being delisted.\n\nThe group had applied for an extension beyond last Dec 5 to meet the requirements for removal from the watch-list and has been given until the end of its current FY (June 30).\n\nGrand Banks acting CEO Peter Poli acknowledged that the deal with Palm Beach will certainly have an \"immediate impact\" on its position with SGX's watch-list.\n\nLast November, Grand Banks had completed a rights issue of one share for every two held, enlarging its share capital base to 173 million shares and increased its market capitalisation to $38 million, making this SGX requirement a more attainable goal.\n\nOn the profitability side, things may be a little more challenging. Despite Grand Banks recording its first profitable three months since 2009 for its second quarter last December, the group still sought ways to increase revenue and profits. It had already highlighted in a note to SGX on Jan 25 this year that it \"remains on the lookout for investment opportunities to widen its market reach and broaden revenue streams\".\n\nIn that same statement, Grand Banks noted that it had not received as many orders as expected from the Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show in November despite an improving US market. Its orderbook as at the end of 2013 declined to S$9 million, from S$16.8 million a year earlier.\n\nNot surprisingly, Mr Poli told BT that two of the criteria that they were looking for in a target company were a profitable company and one that would help provide more orders for its Malaysian factory.\n\n\"We were looking for someone who was either outsourcing production or who had smaller facilities and was increasing capacity,\" he said. \"We were looking at that as an opportunity for us to potentially build new models.\"\n\nGrand Banks shares closed half a cent higher at 22 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

From just 10 players when founder Eddie Chan started it two decades ago, it has now grown to 300, making it Singapore's biggest community of jazz lovers.\n\nBased out of Thomson Community Club, it's made up of both professional and amateur musicians who form the two acts - Thomson Big Band and Thomson Swing Band - under the club. Mr Chan says anybody living in Singapore can join TJC so its members not only hail from every part of the island but also include expatriates. Rehearsals take place every Sunday and public jam sessions are organised on alternate weeks to encourage fellow enthusiasts to explore their love of the genre.\n\nOver the years, TJC has grown to become a local jazz institution and built a loyal following through regular public and private performances. Mr Chan, who is a retired architect and owner of the popular but now-defunct jazz club Southbridge Jazz@7atenine, says its annual big band bash at the Botanic Gardens attracts a crowd of 5,000 and TJC has played in international jazz festivals in Japan, India, Australia and more.\n\nIt also keeps strong ties with other professional jazz musicians here, like Jeremy Monteiro, who's not only an honorary club member but has also written arrangements and performed them.\n\nTJC's swinging repertoire has also caught the ears of other international jazz greats and performed alongside the likes of Paquito D'Riviera, Harold Mabern, Renee Rosnes and Ernie Watts here and abroad. The Thomson Big Band even has a CD release, On a Little Street in Singapore, to its name.\n\nNext Sunday, the club is set to mark its 20th anniversary with a brassy double bill at the Esplanade Concert Hall; joined by special guests from Singapore and the United States - vocalists Alemay Fernandez and Greta Matassa, bassist Christy Smith, and trumpeteer Greg Glassman. Mr Chan says the idea to form TJC came about when the former Singapore Broadcasting Corporation Jazz Orchestra was disbanded and he wanted to revive the big band jazz scene.\n\nThe idea was also to promote an appreciation of jazz and provide the facilities for jazz music-making. Besides Thomson Community Club giving the club a homebase, it earns its keep by playing shows and is financially self-sufficient.\n\nThe initiative is paying off; while there are other ad hoc jazz groups in the scene, none is as well-established as TJC, says Mr Chan. \"The jazz scene has (also) grown over the years due to the development of music education in schools and colleges,\" he adds.\n\nBig Band Magic: 20 Years of the Thomson Jazz Club takes place at the Esplanade Concert Hall on April 20 at 7.30pm. Tickets at $25 and $15 (concession) available from Sistic and at the venue. For more info on TJC and its line-up of activities, check\n\nwww.thomsonjazzclub.com\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Should users change their Web passwords immediately or wait until sites have fixed the problem?\n\nChanging a password before a site has dealt with the coding flaw, called Heartbleed, means the new password could be vulnerable, and the user will have to pick another password when it is fixed. But changing a password is a minor inconvenience compared to getting personal information like credit card numbers stolen.\n\n\"It certainly can't hurt to change your password now and then again next week,\" said Brian Krebs, a security researcher. \"That's not the biggest hardship in the world. It's a very simple thing to do and gives you a little peace of mind.\" The extent of the problem was still unclear on Wednesday. The researchers who discovered the flaw - a simple error in a Web security measure called OpenSSL - said on Monday that up to two-thirds of websites could be affected. Other security experts said the number of sites could stretch into the hundreds of thousands.\n\nBut some Internet, banking and retail companies said they were never vulnerable because they didn't use that type of security software or said they had already repaired the bad code.\n\nGoogle, Facebook and Yahoo confirmed they had been affected by the OpenSSL flaw and had applied fixes to their systems. Security experts said Yahoo users, in particular, should change their passwords, because that company had not completely patched its software until after the flaw became public. On Tuesday afternoon, while looking for vulnerabilities, researchers reported that they had been able to capture user names and passwords from Yahoo.\n\nMany of the country's largest retailers, like Amazon, Walgreens, Nordstrom and Target - which suffered an enormous data breach of its own late last year - said they were not affected. Nordstrom said it would post a statement on its website making clear that it had not been affected, along with tips about keeping information safe online.\n\nNonetheless, security experts said consumers should change their passwords at any site that holds sensitive data, especially because most people tend to use the same passwords on many sites. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

But campaigners fear the tower will simply be demolished because it will be impossible to dismantle it and put it back together again.\n\nIt is the first time a campaign to save a historic building has received such a wide public following, not just from among architecture enthusiasts.\n\nGovernment and city officials are set to meet campaigners for talks on the tower this week that may decide its future. The campaign is not just about saving Moscow's crumbling early Soviet architecture, but also about people having a say in government decisions.\n\n\"We have to learn how to say no,\" said Moscow resident Anna Chernobylskaya, holding a placard at a recent protest under the tower.\n\nVladimir Shukhov, a gifted engineer, built the tower to give Soviet Russia a strong radio signal. At 148 metres, it was Moscow's tallest structure until the 1960s.\n\nThe conical telescope-like design was built with each section lifted into place from the inside. Its slanted supports used the minimal amount of steel.\n\nWhile often compared to the Eiffel Tower, its design is purely functional.\n\n\"It's absolutely ascetic but at the same time very beautiful,\" enthused Alexandra Selivanova, head of the Centre of the Avant-Garde at Moscow's Jewish Museum, who updates a Facebook page on the tower and has organised several protest events.\n\nThe Shukhov tower's owner, the Communications Ministry, says its poor, corroded condition means it must be dismantled, after which it could be rebuilt elsewhere, with proposals including moving it from its southern Moscow neighbourhood to Sevastopol, Crimea's Black Sea fleet base and territory annexed last month from Ukraine.\n\n\"It's the same thing as saying the Eiffel Tower is surrounded by buildings, let's move it to Marseilles,\" said the engineer's great grandson, who is also named Vladimir Shukhov. \"As all specialists say, the tower can only be taken down one way, sawing it down, and after that the monument will be destroyed,\" he said.\n\nHe said the tower apparently fell victim to the interests of developers who have set their sights on the neighbourhood dotted with several other Constructivist buildings in various states of disrepair.\n\n\"This is about redeveloping this whole area,\" he said. \"It's billions (of dollars).\"\n\nArchitects Norman Foster of Britain and Rem Koolhaas of the Netherlands and Nicolas Serota, the director of Britain's Tate Galleries, were among thousands to sign a petition asking President Vladimir Putin for the tower to be restored in situ.\n\nBut Ms Selivanova said it was not just the architectural community that signed the petition; there were many average people who even posted \"selfies\" snapped against the landmark's silhouette in an online campaign.\n\n\"We've collected almost 5,000 signatures just from ordinary Muscovites,\" she said.\n\nThe tower is a leading example of the Soviet Constructivist movement of the 1920s and 1930s which focused on function and experimented with new geometric forms, a pioneering aesthetic that eventually inspired generations of architects around the world.\n\nSmaller campaigns are underway to save Constructivist buildings because they are generally in a very poor state of repair after decades of neglect or else are being remodelled in a way that ignores their historic significance. Many have already been torn down by developers and replaced with new buildings.\n\nThere is meanwhile a family versus government row over the private house of architect Konstantin Melnikov, built in the late 1920s of two vertical cylinders dotted with hexagonal windows.\n\nMr Melnikov's artist son Viktor, on his death in 2006, left the house to be turned into a state museum, and it remains perfectly preserved, even with pencils in original boxes still on Mr Melnikov's desk in the airy studio space. But the house is caught up in a complex dispute between family members and culture officials over its future, which has prevented its opening to the public.\n\nViktor Melnikov's daughter and the will's executor, Yekaterina Karinskaya, is living in the house packed with paintings and antiques, and says she does everything from paying heating bills to clearing snow.\n\n\"It's a phenomenon of unique architecture, unique spirit,\" she told AFP during a rare tour. \"When you come through the gate, you enter a completely different time.\"\n\nThe Culture Ministry says it will turn the house into a branch of the Moscow architecture museum, but Ms Karinskaya wants it to become a museum of its own. While the conflict has dragged on for the past decade, the building is deteriorating. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/travelling-chefs", "site_title": "Travelling chefs", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nTravelling chefs\n\nThree of the world's top restaurants are relocating - actually packing up and moving to a different country. Two of them speak exclusively to BT about what they're doing and why. By Jaime Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 11, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHEY have all topped the Restaurant Guide's World's 50 Best list at one time or another. El Cellar de Can Roca is the current number one, pipping Noma from the hot spot it held for three years running. Fat Duck, in turn, was number two from 2006 to 2009 (it never reached number one on that list, and went into free fall after 2010, although it's always retained its three Michelin stars).\n\nWhen you're idolised as the culinary Holy Grail, what else can you do to up your game? Perhaps in the same way that great minds think alike, the chefs of all three restaurants have taken on what could well be the ultimate culinary challenge - they're closing shop and relocating in a totally different country. Not for good, but long enough to make an impression, and it won't be long before it becomes a trend.\n\nThe Roca brothers of El Celler de Can Roca were the first to start the ball rolling last December. They quietly announced on their blog that they would spend the whole of August in South America to kick off its Roca and Roll World Tour 2014. But this news was eclipsed just two weeks ago, when Noma's Rene Redzepi and The Fat Duck's Heston Blumenthal announced within days of each other that they would be relocating their restaurants next year - two months in Tokyo for Noma and six months in Melbourne for The Fat Duck.\n\nThere are several reasons why the chefs would do something as drastic as that - getting out of their comfort zone; learning about new ingredients and culture; stretching their cooking limits. But at the same time, their standing in the industry means they are able to do it with little, if any, financial risk. For Blumenthal's The Fat Duck in the UK, it was a winning solution. The 17th century former pub that the restaurant in Bray, Berkshire, occupies needs extensive refurbishment. Rather than lay off his staff and hope to re-hire them after, Blumenthal struck a deal with Crown Resorts in Melbourne to relocate to its Towers hotel for the duration. The arrangement is such that after The Fat Duck moves back to Bray, Blumenthal's Dinner by Heston will take its place as the hot London eatery's Australian outpost.\n\nEl Celler's World Tour, in turn, is sponsored by Spanish bank BBVA, and has no impact on the restaurant in Girona, north of Barcelona, because it is closed the whole of August anyway, for summer vacation. And while Redzepi will only reveal details of his partners in June, it's understood that it is a venture with acclaimed Japanese chef Yoshihiro Murata.\n\nWith the money part out of the way, the chefs can just focus on their cuisine, and for Redzepi, it is the opportunity of a lifetime. In an exclusive interview, he shares his fascination with the land of the rising sun.\n\n\"The first time I went to Japan, there was a lot of debate in Denmark about whether we could develop our own cuisine,\" he says. \"People were asking questions like, 'What value would it add to us? Wouldn't it all just be a mirage?'. I was thrilled when I was invited to visit. I had always been inspired reading about such an ancient food tradition, but going there and seeing it firsthand - it was beyond any written word.\n\n\"It felt so alive. Even though you were eating dishes or ingredients that were conceived hundreds of years back, they still felt of the moment. The variety of produce, the preparations - just imagine the countless recipes and techniques that have been developed for the soybean! It's truly mind-blowing what dedication and persistence can do, and it fuelled me even more in my work at Noma.\n\n\"In comparison, what you see in Denmark makes us feel like infants, with Japan as a wise elder. Don't get me wrong: I believe we have lots of quality. I believe our ingredients are world-class. But I also really truly believe that there's a lot for us to learn from exploring a place like Japan.\"\n\nWhile Noma's concept heavily emphasises foraging, Redzepi is unsure if they will do the same in Tokyo. \"I've already been twice during winter to seek out ingredients and to play around with them, as a lot of it is quite different from what we have at home. We already have connected with some farmers and we've been told it won't be a problem finding foragers.\"\n\nThe move to Tokyo certainly makes Noma's much-publicised 10-day pop-up restaurant in London's Claridge's hotel in August 2012 a walk in the park. \"There's no question that it's a whole different game this time,\" says Redzepi. \"Leaving the western world and going into a completely new culture, to be in a country where most of the time people don't understand what you're saying, and vice versa - there are countless challenges ahead. But the reward of being in Japan and exploring a new place, and being able to do it together as a team, is already making all the trials and tribulations worth it.\"\n\nDuring the Tokyo stint, Noma will be closed, as the entire staff will be relocated. He will take the opportunity to do some improvements to the premises, particularly to add a fermentation section - his latest obsession.\n\nIn fact, the whole relocation idea came about because Redzepi wanted to further his knowledge about fermentation and one way was, like young chefs, to stage (take on unpaid work) in Korea or Japan. But that would have been unthinkable given his status and responsibilities. So it was on to his other idea - something he had been dreaming about for years and is about to become reality.\n\nWould he, like most Japanese food fanatics, become so fixated with the country that he would consider staying permanently? \"I have to be honest - it's a question I can't answer,\" he says. \"Given that I'll be having my third child in a few months, the thought of being in Japan sounds unrealistic.\" Even so, \"after our tenure is finished there, the whole staff has five weeks of vacation to explore Japan and the area further. So everyone will really have time to dig deep into this exciting place.\"\n\nThat love of travel and exploring new environments is also what spurred Joan Roca to agree to move his restaurant to Latin America for five weeks beginning in August. Speaking from his restaurant's lounge area in Girona, he says through an interpreter: \"We're always being asked to take the restaurant to other cities but we can't do that and replicate the same quality. But we also want to travel and show the rest of the world what we do, so this is a chance to do that and be true to our cuisine.\"\n\nUnder the agreement with Spanish bank BBVA, the team will spend four to five days in various cities in Mexico, Colombia and Peru. \"We'll be seeking inspiration using the local produce, we'll learn and teach and it's also about rewarding our team for all their hard work.\"\n\nThe aim, he says, \"is to highlight the value of small producers who are not in the circuit - and help them to showcase their authentic and interesting products, eg. those grown by indigenous tribes. It's also part of the bank's social responsibility programme. Another aspect is to help young people. They get grants from the bank and we take them in and give them training.\" The agreement with BBVA will last three years, but it has yet to be confirmed where the El Celler team will go next year.\n\nRoca acknowledges that being voted the world's best restaurant has opened up a whole new world of opportunities like this. \"Being number one was never a goal we set for ourselves and it should never be for anyone because it's difficult to rate and judge restaurants. But it's great that it has happened like that because it puts us on the map and also boosts the local economy as well.\"\n\nWhat with The Fat Duck's Blumenthal also hoping to explore Australian ingredients, will this lead to a new trend of chefs heading off to new, unexplored territory?\n\n\"I don't know whether it will be a trend, but I can tell you that it can be extremely gratifying,\" says Redzepi. \"When we left London, we were extremely tired, but it was genuinely piles of fun and a great experience connecting to a different place for a little while. I do think, though, that going to a place where it's so different from the Anglo-Saxon world will be on a completely different scale in every respect.\"\n\njaime@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However, prices have continued to hold - due to a limited supply of shophouses and most owners taking a longer-term horizon and having holding power.\n\nCBRE's analysis of caveats data shows that 26 shophouses changed hands for a total $118.4 million in the first quarter of this year, down from $149.3 million in Q4 last year and $197.2 milion in the preceding Q3. In Q1 and Q2 last year the figures were $463.7 million and $458 million respectively, reflecting the buoyant market pre-TDSR. CBRE's analysis covered only shophouses on sites zoned for commercial use.\n\nShophouse transactions weakened to $346.5 million in the second half of last year from $921.7 million in the first half - resulting in a full-year figure of $1.27 billon, down from $1.38 billion in 2012.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

An Epson-sponsored survey on restaurant and cafe services in Singapore also showed only 3 per cent of the survey's respondents reporting \"excellent\" service.\n\n\"The new offering includes a range of innovative technologies, including wireless ordering capabilities to reduce customer wait times at every step of the process, leading to smoother work flow, streamlined operations and improved productivity for our service industry customers,\" said Ng Ngee Khiang, general manager of business systems at Epson.\n\nThe TM-i Series products range include the TM-T88V-DT, a built-in server-cum-printer technology that offers cloud-based services such as data analytics, loyalty programmes, coupons, rewards and digital receipts. It enables users to control other printers and major POS peripherals through the Web and back up information to ensure uninterrupted operations even without Internet connection.\n\nWith the series, customers can place their orders and reservations even before entering restaurants and check out as quickly as the TM-i Series products, all designed to be compact in order to save space, connect all mobile devices and applications via Web connection to quickly process customers' orders and receipts. This allows business owners to have faster turnaround rates and tackle the manpower crunch by enhancing worker productivity.\n\nThe products also enable service staff to establish more personalised relationships with customers as the latter's queries, needs and loyalty services can be attended to immediately given the integration of mobile smart devices with the Series.\n\nCompanies such as Softbank Hiro, a Japanese mobile phone shop, and Kushi, a local Japanese dining bar, have utilised the TM-i Series' products since last year and have attested to the system's effectiveness, according to Tan May Lin, general manager of Epson Singapore.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Cargill is said to have signed a lease for close to 50,000 square feet on slightly over two floors.\n\nThe monthly rental is understood to have crossed $9 per square foot (psf).\n\nSwiss private bank Bordier & Cie is also thought to be on the verge of inking a lease for about 11,000-12,000 sq ft - or half a floor - in the building. It is expected to move out of its current location at GB Building along Cecil Street.\n\nA serviced office operator is also in discussions to lease a floor at CapitaGreen, according to market talk.\n\nCargill will be exiting The Concourse along Beach Road, where its lease is understood to run out in the third quarter of next year. Singapore is the regional hub of Cargill in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nIt established its Singapore office in 1981 and its team here comprises about 500 employees, according to the group's website. Four of Cargill's business units are headquartered in Singapore alongside a number of regional and global trading desks.\n\nCapitaCommercial Trust has a 40 per cent stake in the CapitaGreen project, which will have about 700,000 sq ft of net lettable area.\n\nIn January this year, Lynette Leong, CEO of CapitaCommercial Trust Management Ltd, said that as a wish-list, the trust hoped to pre-lease at least half of this space before its completion in Q4 and then fill up the rest of the building later to capitalise on rising office rents.\n\nMs Leong had also said then that the group would be very selective on its first few tenants in the building, as they are expected to be \"loss leaders\" vis-a-vis the $12-14 psf - on a stabilised basis - monthly rental target assumption for the project. \"If we have to drop rents to attract them, we might as well attract very good names so that they can help us in the leasing momentum,\" she said during the group's Q4 2013 results briefing.\n\nCBRE is the marketing agent for CapitaGreen.\n\nTwo podium floors will have about 25,000 sq ft each while the other levels will have 22,000 sq ft per floor. The environmentally friendly development will feature a large expanse of greenery as well as sky terraces on levels 14 and 26. About 55 per cent of its facade will be covered by living plants, while a cool void at the centre core of the property will permit air flow throughout the building, regulating the building's temperature.\n\nPremium and Grade A office rents in Raffles Place and New Downtown continued to climb in Q1, according to a recent report by Colliers International. The quarter also saw office vacancies shrinking and firms taking a proactive approach to reviewing expansion and relocation options to lock in rents before they rise further.\n\nIn the business park arena, Canon has inked a lease for 150,000 sq ft at Galaxis at Fusionopolis Phase 5 in one-north. Galaxis is expected to be completed towards year-end, in time for Canon to make a move from Keppel Bay Tower in the Harbourfront area, where its lease expires in late 2015.\n\nBT understands that the business park space at Galaxis will cost Canon $5-6 psf a month - at least 20 per cent below the rent it would have had to pay on a lease renewal for the 90,000-plus sq ft office space it occupies at Keppel Bay Tower.\n\nAnother major tenant is believed to have signed up at Galaxis for about 70,000 sq ft. Sources suggest this is likely to be an IT company, perhaps Oracle.\n\nChris Archibold, Jones Lang LaSalle's head of markets, said both the office and business park leasing markets have got off to a strong start this year. \"There's quite a lot of activity around new buildings that will be completing this year. Vacancy levels in existing office buildings owned by the major office landlords are very low - mostly below 3 per cent. Occupiers on the expansion trail include companies in the social media/IT, pharmaceutical and fast-moving consumer goods sectors.\"\n\nAgreeing, Colliers International's executive director of office services Marcus Loo said: \"Optimism has returned to the Singapore office market and there's definitely a feel-good factor among landlords.

Imports slipped 11.3 per cent, reversing a 10 per cent rise in February. The trade surplus for the month rebounded to US$7 billion from a US$23 billion deficit a month earlier.\n\nMarkets had expected a growth of 4.2 per cent in exports and 2.8 per cent in imports.\n\nA Customs spokesman said in a statement following the release of the data yesterday: \"Currently, our foreign trade is indeed having some difficulties.\"\n\nThe spokesman added that China's foreign trade has had its competitive advantages in traditional trade eroded as a result of negative factors in play, such as the rising competition posed by neighbouring countries and increasing trade friction with major trade partners.\n\nHowever, the setback will be \"temporary and short-lived\", said the spokesman: \"We cannot jump to the conclusion that our foreign trade is having a recession.\"\n\nA closer look at the figures does yield a slightly less downbeat picture, however.\n\nTrade data in China is notoriously difficult to interpret, and this has not been the first time analysts have been caught by surprise. Companies are known to over-invoice to Hong Kong to disguise the transfer of investment funds, which artificially boosts export figures.\n\nAnalysts say that this is one reason explaining the weaker-than-expected export figures, given that last year's base figure had been unexplainably high.\n\nTaking this into account, analysts say exports are actually on the rise. Yao Wei, a China economist with Societe Generale, said: \"Excluding Hong Kong's numbers from total exports, the year-on-year growth rate would have been 6.7 per cent in March. That is not bad at all!\"\n\nHer estimations are in line with calculations by other economists.\n\nLooking ahead, exports could continue to grow as the global economic landscape brightens.\n\nThe import picture is more downbeat though, say analysts, with demand being hit by recurrent tightening measures by the central bank and reflecting the slowdown of the Chinese economy in the first quarter.\n\nHSBC economists Qu Hongbin and Ma Xiaoping said in a research note yesterday: \"In contrast to last month, it was perhaps the sharp fall in imports that surprised the most in the March data. Part of this would have been due to front-loading and falling commodity prices. But the slowdown in domestic Chinese demand in Q1 is also evident.\"\n\nThey added that despite the distortions in exports, the trade data remains disappointing overall. First-quarter data is due out next week, and many economists have now trimmed their estimates and are expecting growth falling to as low as 7.2 per cent.\n\nAs increasing signs point to a permanent slowdown in the economy, Beijing last week revealed a series of measures to support growth. Though most of these had been previously announced in the five-year plan, they were interpreted by investors as a gauge of confidence in the markets. Investments will be concentrated in the housing and railway sectors, the government said.\n\nThe central bank has also shifted its policies; after two consecutive months of withdrawing cash from the financial system, it made a small injection of liquidity this week to support lending. But analysts say no major stimulus like the 2009 one is expected for now. The full-year growth target has been fixed at \"around\" 7.5 per cent, in a sign that the government is comfortable with slower growth.\n\nYesterday, Prime Minister Li Keqiang reiterated that China's leaders aimed to keep economic growth within a \"reasonable range\" this year and added: \"We will not resort to short-term strong stimulus policies just because of temporary fluctuations.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But the Braddell Heights Symphony Orchestra (BHSO) is out to challenge that; their goal, after all, is to make the music as accessible as possible to anybody, as it plays a mix of everything from Handel to Hollywood film scores at its concerts.\n\n\"When audiences come for our concerts, they know to expect a down-to-earth, relaxed ambience in which to enjoy music,\" says BHSO's general manager, Daniel Heng.\n\nFrom a small string ensemble that planted its roots at the Braddell Heights Community Club (BHCC) in 1986, the BHSO has since grown into a full-fledged symphony orchestra with over 70 members from all over Singapore. It has also garnered a sizeable following, thanks to its outreach programmes such as their masterclasses, open rehearsals, and cosy chamber concerts held at the Community Club which are used to reach out to the public.\n\nBut it wasn't always easy, especially back in the 1980s when there wasn't much push for the arts and classical music wasn't as popular as it is today, says Mr Heng. \"Many CCs were apprehensive about the idea as it had never been done before; BHSO was able to take root in BHCC because of the support of the constituency and, in particular, the then-MP, Goh Choon Kang,\" he adds.\n\nA combination of funding and donations from both government and private organisations help to keep BHSO running through the years but the biggest contributors, according to Mr Heng, are its diverse group of players who come together, rain or shine, every Sunday afternoon. From teenagers to retirees, a banker to a student who holds a grade eight in four instruments, BHSO's members come from all walks of life.\n\nIt also helps nurture young talents by giving a platform to budding instrumentalists to take centre stage and make their orchestral debut through its Singapore Gifted Young Musicians programme, which is integrated into each concert season.\n\nIts Coming Home concert this Sunday, which kicks off BHSO's 2014 concert season, perhaps best sums up what the orchestra stands for and champions. It marks the homecoming of Singapore-born cellist Noella Yan - the youngest and only Singaporean to be accepted into the Purcell School in London when she was only 13 - who will perform the world premiere of Concerto for Cello and Orchestra, written by Bernard Tan, a physicist-engineer-composer who possesses strong music credentials despite his non-musical academic background.\n\n\"Premiering Prof Tan's cello concerto is particularly special to us, because it encapsulates the diversity of interests in the orchestra from composer down to players,\" notes Mr Heng. \"This, to the orchestra, is about the passion for music that transcends the diversity in backgrounds, nationalities, and careers; it's a passion that burns no less brightly despite few of us being full-time musicians.\n\nComing Home, which will also feature Schubert's 'Unfinished' Symphony and Tchaikovsky's 5th Symphony, takes place at School of the Arts Concert Hall this Sunday, April 13 at 5pm. Tickets from $13-$22 (excluding booking fee) are available from Sistic. For more info, check\n\nwww.bhso.org\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Some expressed concern the rate forecasts \"could be misconstrued as indicating a move by the committee to a less accommodative reaction function.\"\n\nUS stocks rallied the most in a month while Treasuries pared declines after the minutes eased concern about the timing of future interest-rate increases. Even after rates rise, officials said last month, they might have to be kept at levels considered below normal for longer because of tighter credit, higher savings and slower growth in potential output.\n\nThe minutes reinforced Janet Yellen's message at her debut press conference as chair last month that the interest-rate forecasts of policymakers - which are displayed as a series of dots on a chart - are less important than the Fed's post-meeting statement.\n\n\"She was pretty blunt about it, saying 'Pay attention to the statement, don't look at the dots', \" said Josh Feinman, the New York-based global chief economist for Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management, which oversees US$400 billion. \"They knew this could be a source of confusion with the dots moving up, and they were thinking about how to manage that.\"\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 1.1 per cent to 1,872.18 at Wednesday's close. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed one basis point to 2.69 per cent.\n\nTreasury yields jumped last month after policymakers predicted that the benchmark rate would increase faster than previously forecast and Ms Yellen said that rates might start to rise \"around six months\" after the Fed ends its bond buying.\n\nThe Fed last month reduced the monthly pace of purchases by US$10 billion, to US$55 billion, and repeated it is likely to continue paring the programme in \"further measured steps\". \"Members agreed that there was sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labour-market conditions,\" the minutes showed. The FOMC next meets on April 29-30.\n\nThe committee last month scrapped its pledge to keep the main interest rate low at least as long as unemployment exceeds 6.5 per cent, saying that it will look at a broader range of data when considering when to increase borrowing costs. Fed officials predicted that the benchmark interest rate would rise faster than previously forecast.\n\n\"While there was general agreement that slack remains in the labour market, participants expressed a range of views regarding the amount of slack and how well the unemployment rate performs as a summary indicator of labour market conditions,\" according to the minutes.\n\n\"Several\" participants saw reasons to suggest \"there might be considerably more labour market slack than indicated by the unemployment rate alone\". - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

To encourage recording orders on the exchange, settlement fees for the transfer and onward settlements recorded on-exchange will also be standardised at $30 per settlement instruction. At the same time, off-exchange transactions will face a charge of 1.5 basis points of the settlement value, with a minimum of $75 per settlement instruction.\n\nMarket makers and liquidity providers will also enjoy reliefs specifically targeted at them. In general, market makers who provide prices for less liquid stocks will be entitled to higher discounts.\n\nMr Ramaswami said that the initial plan is to limit the market-making and liquidity provision incentives - mainly through fee rebates and discounts - to shares that are trading at 50 cents apiece and higher, or whatever the Mainboard's minimum trading price is following an ongoing public consultation. Those thresholds will be continually reviewed.\n\nThe market makers and liquidity providers will be \"old fashioned\" algorithmic traders who will chiefly provide a steady stream of bid and ask prices in the market, Mr Ramaswami said.\n\nThe more controversial high-frequency trading that has sparked criticism and investigations in other markets such as the US is unlikely to take hold in Singapore, he added.\n\nThat is because a lack of multiple trading venues - SGX is the only securities market in the country - takes away a key source of arbitrage.\n\nSingapore will also be steadfast in disallowing order types that could create an uneven playing field, such as \"Hide Not Slide\" orders in the US that let traders hide their order prices in certain circumstances.\n\n\"Time-price priority is sacrosanct,\" Mr Ramaswami said.\n\nKenneth Ng, head of research at CIMB, said that it remains to be seen how much of an impact the market makers and liquidity providers will have on actual trading turnover in the market. Fundamentally, creating a market for a stock is a different matter from having people actually wanting to trade in that stock.\n\n\"Getting the market makers is only the start of the game,\" Mr Ng said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But investor sentiment seems to be warming after the end of the first quarter. Data from EPFR Global points to a revival of interest among institutional investors even though retail redemptions continue to outpace inflows. The first quarter's overall picture, however, isn't pretty. Net redemptions out of emerging market equity funds exceeded US$41 billion compared with net inflows in the same period in 2013 of nearly US$30 billion. Over the past 12 months to April, the US market has returned 19 per cent based on the S&P500 compared with minus 0.11 per cent for emerging-market equities. This year, however, developed and emerging equities are treading water.\n\nTo be sure, emerging market valuations are attractive. Based on the price/earnings multiples, they have been trading at a discount of more than 30 per cent compared with mature markets in recent weeks. But most strategists remain cautious. Political risk is a concern as a number of countries go to the polls this year, including Brazil, Indonesia and India. Economic indicators remain mixed. China's PMI edged up slightly in March, but not enough to dispel concerns about an impact of a slowdown on the rest of the region. Elsewhere, the Institute of International Finance highlights a significant rise in the debt load of emerging-market corporates, from just over 55 per cent of GDP in 2007 to around 80 per cent currently. China's corporate debt to GDP ratio is now the highest in the world, it says, at 145 per cent, while South Korea's is at 110 per cent. It notes that debt-loaded emerging corporates are ill-equipped to deal with the challenges of slower growth and rising interest rates.\n\nInvestors are often urged to be contrarian, but in the current circumstances it may be prudent to wait or drip-feed one's investment into the region. Capital outflows - the bane of emerging market assets - are yet to run their course, and today's attractive valuations could get even more compelling in the near term. Yet another risk is higher interest rates. A simulation by the International Monetary Fund, which posited a 25 per cent rise in borrowing costs and a 25 per cent drop in company earnings in 15 countries, found that emerging market companies accounting for 35 per cent of outstanding debt could find debt servicing a challenge.\n\nIn times like these, investors should embrace what some experts call the only free lunch in finance - diversification. By investing in corporates in the mature markets of the US or Europe, one can still get exposure to emerging economies as many global corporates have substantial footprints in those markets. Investors also benefit from greater liquidity, corporate governance and lower volatility. To be sure, emerging markets' long-term growth prospects are promising.

Mourinho, the self-professed \"Special One\", produced yet another stroke of genius as he got his tactics spot-on.\n\nHis team, Chelsea, looked a shadow of the side that lost so shambolically to Paris Saint-Germain last week. With the French side boasting a 3-1 lead from that match, the Blues knew what they had to do in Tuesday's return clash: score at least twice, and don't concede.\n\nThey kept their nerve and did exactly that. When the second and decisive goal was scored by Senegalese striker Demba Ba right at the end of normal time, Mourinho - usually the calmest figure around - seemed to lose his marbles.\n\nThe silver-haired Portuguese displayed an astonishing burst of speed as he raced down the touchline to the corner flag, joining in his players' jubilant celebrations. Sure, there was still the small matter of seeing out the final minutes of the game, and Mourinho made sure his charges held on for the win.\n\n\"I had to go there because it was the only chance I had to tell them what we had to do in the last few minutes,\" Mourinho said shortly after the final whistle.\n\n\"But I showed you I could run,\" he said, smiling wryly.\n\nOver in Bavaria, just 24 hours later, there was little space for Moyes to run or hide. With his Manchester United going through a horrid domestic campaign, surrendering their defence of the Barclays Premier League (BPL) crown without a fight, the Red Devils' entire season boiled down to this second-leg battle with the reigning world and European champions, Bayern Munich.\n\nWith the tie delicately balanced at 1-1 after a thriller at Old Trafford last week, Moyes sent out his team with two simple objectives: grab that crucial away goal, and don't make any silly mistakes.\n\nManchester United got the first part of the plan done. Defender Patrice Evra stunned the Allianz Arena into silence when he thumped in the sweetest of volleys into the top corner of the net past German goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.\n\nGame on. The onus was back on Pep Guardiola's shell-shocked Bayern team to strike back fast. And boy, how they reacted.\n\nLike a wounded animal, Bayern roared back to life almost immediately. Just 22 seconds after the restart, Mario Mandzukic levelled the scores. With the wind knocked out of United's sails, Thomas Muller and the red-hot Arjen Robben put the result beyond doubt.\n\nA visibly deflated Moyes, slumped in his chair, knew the game was up. His first season in charge will end trophyless. It is also highly unlikely that United will play in next season's competition, given that they are seven points and three rungs away from the final Champions League berth in the BPL standings.\n\nHis post-match comments summed up the Herculean task that awaits him in the summer, when he gets down to rejuvenating his ageing squad.\n\n\"We have got to rebuild and our focus is to get a team that can get back into this competition. It is a great competition - we have really enjoyed it - and there is no shame in going out to Bayern Munich,\" said the Scot.\n\nThat remains his candid assessment, but whether United's American owners, the Glazer family, thinks likewise is another matter altogether.\n\nMoyes has more than five years to go on his contract, and it is still a big question mark whether he will get to see it through.\n\nFor Mourinho, his twin assault on domestic and European glory remains alive. The Blues are still in the running for the BPL title, just two points behind leaders Liverpool with only five games left.\n\nAnd if Mourinho is to win a third Champions League crown with three different clubs, he must first pull out his bag of tricks again and guide Chelsea to victory over Atletico Madrid - the conqueror of Barcelona - in the semi-finals later this month. Assuming he does so, either Bayern Munich or Real Madrid lie in wait in the grand final in Lisbon on May 24.\n\nMourinho has seen and done it all on the biggest stage of them all. He won't fear any of those teams, having watched Chelsea get a second bite of the cherry after many had written them off following the quarter-final first-leg defeat in Paris.\n\nNow in his second stint as the Blues' boss, Mourinho wants to cement his legacy further as one of the most successful managers \"The Beautiful Game\" has ever seen.\n\nOver in Manchester, Moyes can only reflect and wonder what could have been. He will hope to be given enough time and resources to steady his sinking ship. One season out of Europe's elite club competition will be considered a travesty. A time-out longer than that would be unthinkable.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He smiles broadly, happy with the effect he's produced, and walks away to greet another group of guests at the Prudential Malaysian Eye exhibition at MAP @ Publika, a gallery in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe Prudential Malaysian Eye - a collaboration between life insurance company Prudential and Parallel Contemporary Art, which founded the Global Eye programme - is breaking new ground with its comprehensive survey exhibition of contemporary Malaysian art.\n\nSpread across two galleries, it features some exceptional works by 21 emerging and established artists. The accompanying publication, titled Malaysian Eye: Contemporary Malaysian Art, is even more comprehensive, listing 75 contemporary artists that range from the hottest auction names to the lesser-known artists working under the radar of recognition.\n\nBarry Stowe, chief executive of Prudential Corporation Asia, says: \"There's no better way to understand the heart, soul and spirit of any community than to observe what its artists are saying through their art. Hence, the curators looked across the spectrum of Malaysian art.\"\n\nSince the Asian art boom began with Chinese art in 2007, it has spread to other countries such as India, Indonesia and the Philippines. Prices have increased exponentially for works by their top artists.\n\nBut the Malaysian art market has remained firmly outside of the global hubbub and values have remained relatively low. Despite the strong talent that exists and is now on display at the Malaysian Eye exhibition, as well as a thriving local auction scene, few efforts have been made to introduce the art to an international audience.\n\nAmong the 75 artists featured in the Malaysian Eye book, several talented emerging artists are featured, whose mid-sized works are priced on the lower end, between RM5,000 (S$1,940) and RM10,000 (S$3,868). They include Zelin Seah, Hasanul Isyraf Idris, Khairuddin Zainuddin and Sun Kang Jye. For art lovers less interested in speculating in art than simply collecting beautiful art, Malaysia presents a good hunting ground.\n\nTo complement the main exhibition in MAP @ Publika, a satellite exhibition is also being held at the lobby and lounge of Ritz Carlton, Kuala Lumpur. Here, you'll find a portion of the works for sale, including a Cheong Tuck Wai painting that's going for RM2,200, and an Ahmad Shukri Mohd work at RM17,000. Last year, Cheong won the Gold Award at the UOB Painting of the Year 2013 competition (Malaysia).\n\nThe curators, who picked 75 artists for the book from hundreds of portfolios, are Serenella Ciclitira, wife of Mr Ciclitira; Nigel Hurst, Saatchi Gallery CEO; and Johnson Chang Tsong-Zung, founder and director of Hanart Gallery.\n\nMrs Ciclitira is often credited as being the \"Eye\" of the Global Eye programme. She says: \"I've gone to hundreds of international art fairs and I've never seen a single Malaysian artwork on display. That is why we wanted to carry out this project here. There are several skilled artists whose works deserve to be seen and appreciated internationally.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the main Prudential Malaysian Eye exhibition at MAP @ Publika features strong works, including the evocative paintings of Phuan Thai Meng and Kow Leong Kiang, the massive video projections on paintings by Hasnul Jamal Saidon, and the strong conceptually-driven pieces of Sabri Idrus. Works by auction regulars Chang Fee Ming and Ahmad Shukri Mohd, and rising stars such as Chong Ai Le and Azrin Mohd, are also on display.\n\nNazli Aziz, the director of the local Galeri Chandan and the Malaysian adviser to the Prudential Malaysian Eye project, says: \"For any city, the mark that it's arrived is not in the tall buildings, but in its vibrant contemporary culture. Look at cities like Hong Kong, Dubai and Singapore: It always begins with a trading post, then the tall buildings, then the capital markets, and finally... the contemporary art museum. Malaysia doesn't focus on the intangibles. We haven't quite arrived at the realisation that soft power - culture and art - is extremely important in branding the country to the world. Let's hope the exhibition can go some way in creating the awareness of the importance of art.\"\n\nSince 2007, the Global Eye programme has held similar survey exhibitions in other countries, including Indonesian Eye (2011), Korean Eye (2012), and Hong Kong Eye (2013). Altogether, they have attracted some two million visitors. The accompanying books (titled Korean Eye, Indonesian Eye, and so on) have become must-have guides on the art scenes of these countries.\n\nNext up, the team is coming here to embark on a Singapore Eye project. But details will be revealed only in the latter half of the year.\n\nThe Prudential Malaysian Eye runs at MAP @ Publika at Jalan Datumas in Kuala Lumpur from now till April 30, 2014. A satellite exhibition is also taking place at the Ritz Carlton Kuala Lumpur, where some works are for sale.

And, the more than 200-metre-long vessel was built by Keppel FELS at its shipyard in Singapore.\n\nThe Maersk Intrepid is the first in a series of four newbuild ultra-harsh environment jack-up rigs to enter Maersk Drilling's fleet in 2014-16. They represent a total investment of US$2.6 billion.\n\nWith a leg length of 206.8 metres, they are the world's largest jack-up rigs and are designed for year-round operation in the North Sea, in water depths of up to 150 metres.\n\nThe first three jack-up rigs, including Maersk Intrepid, are from the Keppel FELS shipyard for delivery in 2014-2015, and the fourth will be delivered from the Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering shipyard in South Korea in 2016.\n\nKeppel FELS began building the DNV (Det norske Veritas)-class rig last year. With a rated drilling depth of 12,000 metres, the Maersk Intreprid is well-geared to drill in ultra-harsh environments and can accommodate up to 150 crew in one-man cabins.\n\nThe development is another feather in the cap of Keppel. In 2013, Keppel Offshore & Marine (Keppel O&M) delivered 22 newbuild rigs, 21 of which were built by its subsidiary, Keppel FELS. This was a world record as it is the largest number of rigs to be delivered by a single company within a year.\n\nKeppel O&M has delivered more than 40 per cent of the jack-ups to enter the market from 2000 to the first quarter of 2014. It has also delivered more than 30 per cent of the semisubmersible rigs to enter the market in the same period.\n\n\"Keppel and the Denmark-based Maersk are long-time partners. Our collaborations span the design, engineering, repair and construction of a variety of rigs and ships,\" a spokesman for Keppel told The Business Times.\n\nKeppel and Maersk Drilling have joined hands to build 12 new rigs to-date. The first of Maersk Drilling's ultra-harsh environment jack-up is expected to be deployed next week to commence a four-year contract with Total E&P Norge.\n\nThe Maersk Intrepid will be drilling the demanding wells on the Martin Linge field development in the Norwegian North Sea. The estimated value of the firm contract is US$550 million with the possibility for extension of four one-year options.\n\n\"We are opening a new chapter in Maersk Drilling's Norwegian history. We have invested in the Maersk Intrepid and its three sister rigs in order to continue to grow and leverage our market leading position in Norway,\" said Claus V Hemmingsen, CEO of Maersk Drilling and a member of the Executive Board of the A.P. Moller - Maersk Group.\n\n\"The Maersk Intrepid is the first of the four rigs being delivered and I am very pleased that it is going to Norway to work for one of our key customers, Total E&P Norge AS,\" he said.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Even disappointing trade data from China failed to dent market optimism.\n\nThe SGD has strengthened 1.2 per cent against the greenback year to date, said Saktiandi Supaat, head of FX research at Maybank global markets. From the lowest point of 1.2830 touched in January, the local currency has appreciated 3 per cent.\n\nThe SGD had tanked less than three weeks ago, falling almost one per cent, after comments by US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen that interest rates might rise earlier than expected.\n\nBut Wednesday's minutes from the Fed suggested that rates might stay put for a while yet, giving fresh impetus to the latest rally.\n\n\"On the surface, China's trade data looked disappointing, but Tommy Xie (our China economist) does not think the March export data looks as bad as what the headline suggested,\" said OCBC Bank economist Selena Ling.\n\nChina's March imports slumped 11.3 per cent year on year to US$162.4 billion while exports fell 6.6 per cent to US$170.1 billion, against market expectations of an increase in trade numbers.\n\n\"In particular, he attributed it to the high base effect (exaggerated by fake trade and arbitrage flows in Q1 2013) and expects China's export growth to reaccelerate in Q2, given the US and EU recovery is on track,\" said Ms Ling.\n\nNotably, China's export growth to G-3 economies actually rebounded to 6 per cent from a contraction of 12.5 per cent in February, she said.\n\nRegional currencies, too, have risen faster as emerging markets came back into play.\n\nEdward Lee, Standard Chartered's regional head of research, South-east Asia, said the rally against the US dollar was not confined to the SGD.\n\n\"In fact, if we compare Asian currency performance against the USD on a year-to-date basis, the SGD ranks sixth among eight Asian currencies that rallied against the USD so far this year,\" he said.\n\nThe ringgit is up by more than 1.73 per cent year to date, while the rupee is almost 3 per cent higher. The rupiah was up by almost as much as 15 per cent earlier this month but has since fallen to about 7 per cent because of disappointment over the smaller win by the opposition Indonesian Democratic Party - Struggle in parliamentary elections on Wednesday.\n\n\"A key driver for the weak USD (and concomitantly stronger SGD) is the inability of US Treasuries yields to break higher,\" he said.\n\nSince the beginning of January, US 10-year yields have fallen from more than 3 per cent to 2.65 per cent on the back of poor US growth data affected by extremely harsh winter conditions in the United States this year, said Geoff Kendrick, Morgan Stanley's head of Asian FX rates and strategy.\n\n\"This dollar weakness provided support to EM currencies in Asia in Q1 2014, especially those with higher external funding requirements,\" he said.\n\nMaybank's Mr Supaat said the USD had been sold off on talk that yield-hungry traders were shifting from developed markets to emerging markets.\n\n\"The carry trade will continue over the next few months . . . traders are trying to take position in between Fed announcements . . . which at times are coming out with contradictory messages,\" he said.\n\nThe carry trade happens when traders borrow from low interest-rate currencies, in this case the US dollar, to invest in higher yielding currencies.\n\nMorgan Stanley's Mr Kendrick said risks from China had abated with the RMB band widening and the recent announcement of growth stabilisation measures from China.\n\n\"At the same time, US yields continue to stay depressed causing a broadbased sell-off in the US dollar. The SGD is benefiting from both these factors over the past few weeks,\" he said.\n\nLeif Eskesen, HSBC's chief economist for India and Asean, reckons the strengthening of the Singapore dollar and other regional currencies since earlier this year partly reflects the combination of a dovish Fed and soft US economic data.\n\n\"Specifically for Singapore, a factor is also the upcoming monetary policy meeting and the expectation that MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) will continue with its current tightening stance,\" he said.\n\nAdded Mr Kendrick: \"SGD will continue to be driven by the global risk environment in our view - weakening if risks from China re-emerge and strengthening if we continue to remain in the weaker dollar, high-liquidity environment.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Since the first free election in 1999, parliaments have developed an unsavoury legacy of becoming a hotbed of corruption. One example is the 73 members of the country's House of Representatives who have been jailed by the Corruption Eradication Commission since the watchdog's inception in 2002.\n\nThe comments may also reflect a strategic blunder. By waiting until mid-March to name Mr Widodo as its preferred presidential candidate, there was precious little time for him to put his stamp on a party closely associated with its chairwoman, Megawati Sukarnoputri.\n\n\"Voters still prefer Jokowi as president, but they didn't associate him to the PDI-P,\" says Fauzi Ichsan, managing director and economist at Standard Chartered in Jakarta.\n\nVote sampling showed that PDI-P will likely win little more than 20 per cent of the popular vote at Wednesday's election that chose more than 19,000 lawmakers for local legislatures, as well as the House of Representatives (DPR) in Jakarta. That put them ahead of Golkar, headed by Aburizal Bakrie, which took 15 per cent and the Great Indonesia Movement Party, headed by former general Subianto Prabowo, with 12 per cent. Official results are due on May 6.\n\nEven so, it was a far cry from the 30 per cent the PDI-P reckoned it would win with Mr Widodo as its leader. Opinion polls had suggested that the party could win much more. But that sort of performance hinged on a large turnout of around 67 million young voters under the age of 30, including some 30 million voters casting a ballot for the first time who have no memory of dictatorship under former president Suharto. Pollsters had forecast before Wednesday's election that as many as half of them would not turn up.\n\nDaniel, 24, who would only give his first name, was one of those who did turn up at the polling station. He said that a sense of civic duty compelled him to cast his ballot, though he did not know any of the names of the 36 candidates running for the DPR, as well as for the less powerful Regional Representative Council and for local assembly.\n\n\"It'll be easier to vote for president. I know him,\" Daniel said of Mr Widodo.\n\nUnder the country's election rules, parties or coalitions with at least 20 per cent of the seats in the DPR or 25 per cent of the popular vote can field a candidate. The PDI-P will likely now have to form a coalition to cobble together the needed support to put Mr Widodo's name forward.\n\n\"The PDI-P didn't expect to be in this situation,\" Mr Ichsan said.\n\nNeither did investors. The rupiah gave up more than a week of steady gains on confidence that the PDI-P would post a big win. The rupiah lost 0.5 per cent, falling to just under 11,500.\n\nThe undercurrent among many voters here this week was frustration with the political parties. Few, they said, bothered to talk about the single biggest issue for most: corruption.\n\n\"Jokowi is a good man,\" said Iwan Kurniawan, a 42 year old driver. \"But just because he is the leader of PDI-P doesn't mean all PDI-P are good men.\"\n\nHe says that he is likely to vote for Mr Prabowo in July, because he wants Mr Widodo to remain in his current position as governor.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Viewers who enjoy the occasional what-just-happened cinematic moment will have sufficient material for post-movie discussion here - and chances are they still won't be able to figure the whole thing out.\n\nDirector Villeneuve, who portrayed the desperate lengths to which an ordinary man would go to save a loved one in the disturbing thriller Prisoners (2013), pulls out all the psychological stops in his unconventional new film, based on the novel The Double by Nobel Laureate Jose Saramago. This time, it's about the mysteries of a fragile mind and the games that play out inside our minds as well. It's probably worth emphasising that this is the sort of movie that's more suited to film festivals than your local multiplex.\n\nHeavily bearded and permanently dishevelled college professor Adam Bell (Jake Gyllenhaal) leads a life that's been dulled by the daily grind of history lectures to his students, punctuated by bouts of rough sex at night with his girlfriend Mary (Melanie Laurent). It's a pattern that repeats itself until his curiosity is aroused one evening when he watches a rental DVD and spots a minor character that looks exactly like him.\n\nAdam embarks on a quest to locate and get under and into the skin - so to speak - of the lookalike, whose name is Anthony St Clair (Gyllenhaal again), an aspiring actor with a heavily pregnant wife (Sarah Gadon). His task is made simpler because Anthony also lurks on the fringes of normalcy. Some nights for instance, he visits an illicit voyeur's club where naked women parade on stage, catering to the perversions of assembled onlookers. One act involves a giant tarantula served on a silver platter. It's a creepy yet alluring scene, and spiders will prove to be a recurring theme in the movie.\n\nThe deliberate pace, gloomy soundtrack and yellowish hues that Villeneuve frames the Toronto skyline contribute to the overall bleakness of Enemy, although there are moments when the mood is lifted a little, as when Isabella Rossellini - one-time muse of David Lynch - makes an oddly reassuring appearance as Adam's mother. The realistic, psychologically intense movies of directors such as Lynch (Blue Velvet, 1986) and David Cronenberg (Naked Lunch, 1991) come directly to mind as relatable precursors to Enemy.\n\nGetting to grips with a disturbing metaphysical thriller where nothing is ever what it seems isn't easy and Enemy, written by Javier Gullon, will prove to be a difficult challenge for filmgoers. Gyllenhaal, minus the facial tic that was such a distraction in Prisoners, gives a convincingly edgy performance of a troubled man on the verge, but it isn't enough to salvage the movie. An inkling of what's to come is provided by a cryptic message that flashes across the screen at the beginning: Chaos is order yet un-deciphered. By the end, the only certainty is that everything - this film included - is one big mess.\n\nRating:\n\nC\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Rachel Loi\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 11, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTO landscape architect Brendan Moar, the idea of show gardens is just a little bit peculiar.\n\n\"They are such a different beast to the normal gardens I am so used to,\" says the boisterous 44-year-old Australian who lives in Sydney. \"The plants aren't really growing - they're just sitting there. But you gotta make it look like a real garden, so it's quite an art form,\" he explains with a laugh.\n\nIronically, he has a natural flair for it, because he won big at the Australian Garden Show last year despite it being his first-ever attempt designing a show garden. He took home a Gold Medal, and awards for Best in Show as well as the People's Choice.\n\nBut he isn't taking his success for granted, as he admits he still has a lot of work to do to prepare for the upcoming Singapore Garden Festival in August this year.\n\n\"It's my first time doing a garden here, so it's quite daunting to get around and see what Singaporeans are exposed to every day. And I've noticed there's a really high level of design here!\" he says.\n\n\"In Australia you wouldn't find this level of planting and attention to detail in the streets. Here all the amazing plants I see in the nurseries are everywhere in public spaces. So you're a hard audience to design for, because you've seen it all.\"\n\nSo far, the concept for his festival show garden is still a work-in-progress, he reveals. But at the very least, Mr Moar intends to maintain his personal style - a balance between plants and architecture, and a contrast of simple elements against complicated ones.\n\nAt the same time, he is also keeping one clear vision in mind - the design must be catered to the local audience.\n\nThat's because to him, the most important thing about garden design is that audiences have to be able to connect with it. He explains: \"When you're designing a garden in Singapore, it has to look like it belongs. As opposed to recreating a part of France in the middle of Singapore - that will just look a bit like Disneyland.\"\n\nTo make people actually like his garden after connecting with the design is an entirely separate issue altogether. That's something which can't always be described with mere words, he says.\n\n\"Everything I say on this topic often sounds esoteric and lofty, but that's because I'm so driven by the mood in a garden. I could describe what my garden is made of, but what I'm aiming to do is to create a feeling and an emotional response. Just like a work of art, it's all about a person's response,\" he adds.\n\nAccording to Mr Moar, his gardening career began at the age of 17, all because of an intense dislike for studying. He would while away his time in the afternoons doing anything else that he could find, but after running out of \"terrible daytime TV\" to watch, he found the next best thing was to rummage around in his family's garden.\n\nA little like a fairy tale, he fondly recalls: \"It was somewhere amongst the azaleas that I got hooked, even though I didn't really know what I was doing.\"\n\nMr Moar eventually went on to study landscape architecture in university, and later he worked as a TV host for various Australian design-related programmes like Dry Spell Gardening, The Renovators and Moar Gardening.\n\nWhen asked where he gets inspiration for his designs, Mr Moar explains that most of them simply come to him in the course of everyday life.\n\nPointing at a few horizontal black scratches on a white wall in front of him, he says: \"Say I had a design problem that I haven't been able to work out, so I shelved it in my subconscious. Seeing those scratches might be as likely to trigger something as seeing one of the world's greatest buildings.\"\n\nAlthough taking part in the Australian Garden Festival started out as a favour to a friend (the organiser), Mr Moar admits he is finally starting to enjoy doing show gardens, because their temporal nature gives him a chance to have a little fun.\n\n\"It's a chance to make a little piece of magic. All this work goes into it, the garden gets created, and then it disappears. It's a moment of fleeting beauty which happens so often in nature. Flowers are ephemeral - they're here, you see them, they make you feel a certain way, and then you go on. And that's how I feel about these show-gardens now,\" he says.\n\nrachloi@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So the Australian-led search is racing to determine an exact location before sending down a submersible to plumb the Indian Ocean depths.\n\nThe Perth-based Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) said that the latest ping was detected yesterday afternoon by an Australian air force P-3C Orion surveillance plane, which has been dropping dozens of sonar buoys into the remote waters of the search zone.\n\n\"The acoustic data will require further analysis overnight but shows potential of being from a man-made source,\" JACC chief Angus Houston said in a statement.\n\nThe Australian ship Ocean Shield, bearing a special US Navy \"towed pinger locator\", is now focused on a far smaller area of the Indian Ocean 2,280 kilometres north-west of Perth where it picked up two fresh signals on Tuesday. Those transmissions matched a pair of signals logged over the weekend.\n\n\"When you put those two (sets of pings) together, it makes us very optimistic,\" US Seventh Fleet spokesman William Marks said on CNN, adding that the search was getting \"closer and closer\".\n\n\"This is not something you find with commercial shipping, not something just found in nature - this is definitely something that is man-made, consistent with what you would find with these black boxes.\"\n\nCmdr Marks said that he expected the pings to last \"maybe another day or two\" as the batteries powering the black box beacons fade after their normal lifespan of about 30 days.\n\nNo floating debris from the Malaysia Airlines aircraft, which disappeared on March 8 with 239 people aboard, has yet been found despite days of exhaustive searching by ships and aircraft from several nations.\n\nMr Houston said that the high-tech underwater surveillance was meant to define a reduced and more manageable search area in depths of around four kilometres, but he acknowledged that time was running out.\n\n\"I believe we are searching in the right area but we need to visually identify the aircraft before we can confirm with certainty that this is the final resting place of MH370,\" he said on Wednesday.\n\nHe again urged against unduly inflating hopes, for the sake of the families of missing passengers and crew who have endured a month-long nightmare punctuated by a number of false leads. But he voiced renewed optimism.\n\n\"They (experts) believe the signals to be consistent with the specification and description of a flight data recorder,\" he said.\n\nNo other ships will be allowed near the Ocean Shield as it must work in an environment as free of noise as possible, but up to 10 military aircraft, four civil planes and 13 ships were to have taken part in surface searches in the region yesterday, the JACC said.\n\nMr Houston said that it would not be long before a US-made autonomous underwater vehicle called a Bluefin-21 would be sent down to investigate, but has cautioned that it will have to operate at the very limits of its capability given the vast depths involved. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

It will be closed through Friday at least,\" said Mike Reed, chief of prevention for the Coast Guard's upper Mississippi River sector.\n\nA vessel towing 15 barges upriver hit the bridge on Tuesday, damaging a portion of the protective pier. The bridge was not structurally damaged and reopened to train traffic by 6 pm CDT (2300 GMT) on Tuesday, said Canadian Pacific spokesman Ed Greenberg. \"There were no trains on or near the bridge when the accident took place,\" Mr Greenberg said.\n\nBut the Coast Guard's Mr Reed said the river will remain closed to barge traffic until the pier is repaired and it is determined that no debris will hamper vessels from passing.\n\nThe barges involved in the accident were transporting dry cargoes, Mr Reed said, adding that he did not know exactly what they were shipping.\n\nIt is common for barges to carry fertiliser or salt upstream and ship grains downstream. The river is the main shipping route to ports along the US Gulf Coast, where roughly 65 per cent of corn, soybeans and wheat are exported.\n\nOnly one tow was waiting to pass the closed section of the Mississippi River at Sabula, Mr Reid said.\n\nThe traditional start of the shipping season has been delayed by about two weeks on the upper Mississippi River. Ice on Lake Pepin, located just south of the river source at Minneapolis, was too thick for barge traffic and it could be a week or more before it is passable. \"No one is talking about making a run at Lake Pepin yet,\" said a barge trader in Minneapolis. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Most crude exports are banned and the 13 ships that can legally move oil between US ports are booked solid. The federal Jones Act restricts domestic seaborne trade to vessels owned, flagged and built in the US and crewed by citizens.\n\nThe glut will make prices of benchmark West Texas Intermediate oil US$13 a barrel cheaper than Brent, the international benchmark, later this year from about US$5 now, according to Bank of America Corp forecasts. The EIA forecasts the average gap for this year will be about US$9.\n\nCompanies built and reversed pipelines that helped carry a record amount of oil to the Gulf Coast from the Midwest last year. Total US production reached 8.23 million barrels a day last week, the highest level since May 1988.\n\nMeanwhile, a 1975 law bans most overseas US crude shipments. While supplies to Canada, one of the exceptions allowed, have risen to a record, the US exports 3 per cent of the oil it produces, Energy Department data show.\n\nMariners' unions and domestic shipping companies say the Jones Act is critical to national security. Lawmakers are discussing ways to extend rather than curtail it, such as by requiring liquefied natural gas exports to go on US ships.\n\nEven as Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the senior Republican on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, added her support to Exxon Mobil Corp's call to lift restrictions on crude exports, other lawmakers in Congress say they're concerned shipments would increase petrol prices at home.\n\nThe glut may start to shrink in the second quarter as refineries ramp up to meet summer petrol demand. Plants on the Gulf Coast handled a record 7.92 million barrels a day of crude last year, equal to almost 80 per cent of Chinese consumption in 2012, according to data compiled by the IEA and Bloomberg. Refinery runs in the region rose by 167,000 barrels a day to 8.22 million last week, EIA data show.\n\nSwelling inventories may also be curbed by falling crude imports, which last year averaged the lowest since 1996. US refineries also exported a record 3.1 million barrels a day of petrol, diesel and other petroleum products last year, EIA data show. The US allows product exports.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute, which represents the US oil and gas industry in Washington, is developing legal challenges to the crude export restrictions. Overturning the 1975 law would allow the US to ship 1.5 million barrels a day and become one of the 10 largest crude exporters, according to JBC Energy, a Vienna-based consulting firm. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The move by Silchester also meant UIC having to acquire more than 9 per cent of outstanding shares for the delisting to take place.\n\nEarlier, UIC would need to secure only just above one per cent of the shares from the free float as Silchester's substantial 8.16 per cent stake was not deemed to be part of the public float under SGX listing rules. Under Singapore rules, it is deemed that a company needs to delist if less than 10 per cent of its shares are in the public float.\n\nWhile UIC will still be able to seek a voluntary delisting of SingLand if it does not garner sufficient shares in SingLand, the move by Silchester has raised the question of whether the exit offer was fair.\n\nLooking at the way the share price of SingLand has responded to the offer, it would appear that investors do not agree with the offer price of $9.40 a share. SingLand shares have been trading above the offer price on most days since the offer date. This would defy logic given that UIC has already said it will not revise the offer price.\n\nWhen considering the fairness of a takeover offer, the independent financial adviser typically looks at past transactions over one year.\n\nWhile this is common market practice, the outcome in this case is a list of companies across vast industries that are not exactly comparable. The delisting of some Chinese companies last year also skewed the list somewhat with their lower offer premiums.\n\nEven going by this not-all-perfect list of comparables, the offer premium for SingLand is lower than the median seen for successful delisting offers and privatisation offers last year.\n\nOffer premiums\n\nIf one were to narrow the list to purely Singapore-based developers that have delisted in the past few years, the companies making the list would be MCL Land, Allgreen, and SC Global.\n\nBy comparing the offer premium for SingLand with the offer premiums for these companies, it would appear that UIC's offer price for SingLand represents a measly premium of 11.2 per cent over the last transacted price before the offer date, compared with the takeover offer premiums of 25.6 per cent for MCL, 39.13 per cent for Allgreen and 49.4 per cent for SC Global.\n\nThe premium gap would be wider when we look at the offer premium over a one-year volume weighted average price (VWAP). It would be 7.85 per cent for SingLand, compared with 30.2 per cent for MCL, 43.2 per cent for Allgreen and 71.1 per cent for SC Global.\n\nArguably, market conditions are now different from those prevalent when the takeover offers for the other property companies were made. But the softening property market sentiment should already have been priced into the share price of SingLand. Hence, it would not be fair to say that a smaller offer premium is justified because of weaker market conditions.\n\nThe starkly smaller premium for SingLand becomes less justifiable when one considers that shares of MCL, Allgreen and SC Global all had a strong run-up of more than 50 per cent over the preceding one year prior to their offer dates - this again reinforces the argument that stronger market conditions then were priced into the shares of those property counters.\n\nIt could be that MCL, Allgreen and SC Global's larger free floats at the time of their delistings meant that a more compelling offer was required to gain sufficient acceptances from shareholders.\n\nBut the rather small pool of public investors in the case of SingLand should still deserve their fair share of returns for having stuck with the company through past property cycles.\n\nMinority shareholders of SingLand risk being worse off holding illiquid stocks if they choose not to accept UIC's offer by the close of the offer. They are perhaps better off accepting the offer and use the cash to buy into a higher yielding property stock.\n\nMore time\n\nYet, at the same time, they are finding the exit offer from UIC less appealing, relative to the gains of shareholders of other property developers that delisted.\n\nUIC probably realises that minority shareholders need more time to decide on the offer when it extended the closing date for the offer from April 7 to April 21.\n\nBut whether it realises how its offer is viewed by other investors remains a big question mark. Hopefully, the exit of SingLand from the Singapore bourse will not leave shareholders with a bitter aftertaste when it is within UIC's means to make the parting sweeter.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

More than half the tickets have already been sold since they went on sale last week.\n\nThe Taiwan-based star reveals that performing on the Singapore stage is in fact more nerve-racking than performing elsewhere. \"Because this is my hometown, I feel way more nervous,\" she admits, though she doesn't dismiss nerves as a bad thing and instead believes they are vital to putting on a good show. \"I try to preserve the nerves; I feel that once you tell yourself you can relax, that's the biggest mistake.\"\n\nKepler, released in February this year, is her first album since 2011 and its theme, conceptualised by Sun herself, is inspired by the 17th-century astronomer Johannes Kepler. Incidentally, the word, \"Kepler\" on the tour's promotional poster features Sun's handwriting.\n\nThe new mother adds there's a new side of her to be found in the collection of songs too. \"This album has been a really big gift to me; these new songs are very different from the others because they're not just about romance and being happy all the time,\" Sun beams.\n\nThe Stefanie Sun 2014 Kepler World Tour will take place on July 5, 8pm at the National Stadium.

A total of 39 honours were handed out on Monday night at the Pan Pacific Orchard Singapore.\n\nChef Yves Schmid, executive chef of The Senso Group, felt that the restaurant won because of \"a combination of factors: the understated elegance of our premises, attentive and efficient service, high-quality ingredients, and the marriage of innovation with tradition - something needed in a contemporary Italian restaurant nowadays.\"\n\nRestaurant manager Christopher Soh of Cherry Garden, famed for its Cantonese cuisine, added that the award was an honour for the team and a motivation to work even harder to create innovative new menus paired with the hotel's top-notch service standards.\n\nAn external panel comprising ambassadors and head honchos who visited incognito, critiqued the restaurants from a shortlist compiled by veteran food critics such as The Straits Times' Tan Hsueh Yun and Wong Ah Yoke and Lianhe Zaobao's Dr Ng King Kang.\n\nRestaurant Andre emerged as Restaurant of the Year for the second year, while other key awards such as the Best Dinner Experience went to Jaan in the Western category and Shinji by Kanesaka in the Asian category. The Best New Restaurant Award went to Bacchanalia (Western) on Coleman Street and Hashida Sushi (Asian) at Mandarin Gallery.\n\nPointing out that this year's list of winning restaurants also includes casual dining concepts reflective of the current dining landscape in Singapore, Sylvester Ng, editor of The Peak Selections: Gourmet & Travel, said: \"As the restaurant scene gets more vibrant with new players and ever-changing concepts to cater to more discerning palates, it has also brought about a delicious diversity.\"\n\nThe Peak Selections: Gourmet & Travel is an award-winning tri-annual publication of luxury magazine The Peak which is published by SPH Magazines.

For a while, every time Ms Lord, a 32-year-old band promoter in Arlington, Virginia, posted a photograph on Instagram from her studio apartment, she was reminded of their existence.\n\nSelect filter. Write caption. Name location.\n\nIt was during that final step in uploading her photo that a list of places nearby would pop up - not just the names of businesses in the area, but nicknames people had given their homes. Hell and Namaste, Om shanti were always near the top.\n\nCourtesy of geotagging software, Ms Lord was being introduced time and again to two of her closest neighbours and their diametrically opposed outlooks on life.\n\n\"I know it sounds silly,\" she said. \"But it made me sad to think there were people living in Hell so close by.\"\n\nThen again, she added: \"Everywhere I go, it's Om Shanti, Shanti, Namaste. I am a yoga person, but it's, like, 'OK, really?',\"\n\nAs it turned out, Ms Lord's tranquillity-loving neighbour in Namaste, Om shanti had also found herself pondering Hell, which had mysteriously disappeared.\n\n\"I definitely wondered, is someone in trouble?\" said Shelley Tidmore, 35, a health and lifestyle coach, who watched the Foursquare check-ins into the underworld from her carefully named home: Namaste, Om shanti refers specifically to her yoga space, while her bathing area goes by Princess Shower, Heaven on Earth. (No photos there, only check-ins.)\n\nWhen referring to her home as a whole on social media, she calls it Apollo's Palace of Wonder, in homage to her hairless cat.\n\nIn an odd twist of 21st-Century life, the location updates that are an integral part of social media like Instagram, Foursquare and Facebook seem to have resurrected a tradition of the moneyed elite: home naming.\n\nModest suburban houses, tiny urban apartments and a variety of other kinds of residences - unimposing places where no one would ever bother to hang anything so formal as a sign - now have their own digital placards, offering a glimpse of who lives there, how they see themselves and how they want others to see them.\n\nThere is no comprehensive map of all the geotagged homes in the world, but if you know where to look, they're everywhere.\n\nTake a meandering bike ride through New York City, posting to Instagram as you go, and Zach and Tom's Crooked Castle in the Sky, Hidden Shadow Village and Team Dying Alone HQ may emerge as suggested locations.\n\nOr simply scroll through the social media streams of Facebook or Instagram and you may happen upon a video of a party tagged to Candyland, the home of Jeremy Bowditch, 30, a freelance photographer, or an image of sunflowers that leads you to the Habitat, the Chicago residence of Anjali Pinto, 25, another freelance photographer.\n\nAll of this is ages away from the origins of the tradition, which lives on in its original form in many places, as Donald Trump discovered to his dismay several years ago when he renamed Menie House, a 14th-Century manor in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, MacLeod House in honour of his mother, Mary MacLeod, and was accused of erasing 700 years of Scottish history. (Trump's critics took issue with his assertion that it was \"a fairly minor change\", as his spokesman characterised it in The Sunday Times.)\n\nIn the United States, home naming peaked more than a century ago, said Thomas Hubka, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee architecture school.\n\nAnd unlike in Britain, where even modest homes often have names, it was the province of the very wealthy.\n\nBut Frank Hebbert, an urban planner working on a project to map the historical names of every residential building in New York City, said that what's happening now is very different: \"What you are seeing is that people are treating their homes more like the rest of their digital identity.\"\n\nThis means not only that \"it's extremely customisable,\" he said, but also that there is a new order when it comes to what impresses.\n\nOnce, an engraved placard with a British or French name or the surname of a well-known family was a sign of prestige; now what matters is digital savvy.\n\n\"What you see with the digital naming,\" Mr Hebbert said, \"is that if I want to give my apartment a Hawaiian-themed name, I can do that, and I use that as social currency.\"\n\nAs Ms Lord, the band promoter, said: \"It's all smoke and mirrors. That's what I love about it.\" - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

The building, with a bronze, stone and glass facade, will attempt to reflect some of the Nobel aspirations, according to the winning architecture studio.\n\n\"It has a certain classical simplicity and solidity,\" British architect David Chipperfield said. \"It tries to find a balance between being solid on the one hand and transparent on the other.\"\n\nTwo-thirds of the project's budget are already secured by private donations.

The late artist was one of those who benefited from the Land Transport Authority's Art in Transit project - perhaps the single most effective way of showcasing local artists.\n\nHis large woodcut mural for the Esplanade station makes one think of a bygone era - both because of its subject and the mode of art-making, but it was in fact one of the last works by the Singapore-born second-generation artist who died in 2008, at 72 years of age. It was also his only commission and monumental work in Singapore.\n\nLim's behind-the-scenes perspective of the Chinese opera at the Esplanade Station is iconic in many ways which will be evident at the retrospective of some 60 works now showing at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (Nafa). Lim Mu Hue: The Inventive Life is the first major exhibition on the artist after his death, and the works on show - featuring his sketches from his days as a student at Nafa, right up to his works in the mid-2000s - lifts the veil of this artist's talent and versatility, and also avant-garde experiments of his time.\n\nBesides the woodcut work that he's known for and championed, especially noteworthy are Lim's charcoal and pastels on paper work, and his oils on wood.\n\nHis eldest daughter, Lim Chwen, 48, worked closely with her father in his latter years and has no doubt that her father had a calling as an artist. \"He was working right up until his death,\" she relates. \"And he never stopped drinking (beer) and smoking, even though he had esophagus cancer. 'The doctor says my lungs are fine', he used to say,\" she adds.\n\nHis home was his studio, and Lim always included his children (three from his first marriage, and one from his second wife after the death of his first) in his work, she shares, recalling how she had grown up with many artists coming and going from their home.\n\nLim was a graduate from Nafa, where he studied under teachers Georgette Chen and Cheong Soo Pieng. He later taught at Nafa for a while, and was also the art editor at Nanyang Siang Pau from 1969 to 1972 until he left to run a colour separation business.\n\n\"But in the 1990s, we persuaded him to give up his business and just concentrate on his art,\" she chuckles, reminiscing about the difficult years for the family when most of Lim's art sales would be used to prop up his business. He finally practised art full-time from 1992.\n\nLim's drawings of koi sold best, and there is a small selection of these works on exhibit. \"These were really his bread-and-butter drawings, as they were popular with businessmen - he didn't care much for it,\" explains Lim Chwen, a web designer based in San Francisco.\n\nThey might be commercial but one can appreciate the lithe and fluid drawings of fish, done with coloured chalk on paper. As for Lim's woodcut works - his first major exhibition in Singapore was in 1966, for the iconic Six Men show. There were a few more solos after that, including two in Kuala Lumpur in 1973 and 1992, and one in Taiwan in 2004, California in 2004, and in Penang in 2006.\n\n\"In fact, the shows in Taiwan and California sold well, and he was very much encouraged by it, which led him to hold an exhibition at the Hainan association in 2005 - his last show in Singapore,\" says Chwen.\n\nLim championed woodcut because it was a dying art form in the 1950s-60s, and he was trying to revive it, to little avail though, given that the last iconic exhibition in Singapore was the group exhibition in 1966. \"But it also has to do with his passion for puppet theatre. He mirrored his carving and time to do the woodcuts with the puppet masters who took time to make puppets,\" shares Chwen.\n\nConceptually, the woodcut of the Chinese opera scenes and puppet theatre was also his philosophical view of how the \"real life\" of puppet theatre were the folks behind the scene rather than the performers. This can be seen in \"Backstage\" - a woodcut made in 1960 and printed in 1966.\n\nAfter his passing in 2008, the family decided to donate most of Lim's works to the NUS Museum (which also has an exhibition of his works now), and planned for this exhibition only after the fifth anniversary of his death to honour his legacy.\n\n\"He had left behind so much... and it was difficult for us to manage it, so we decided to donate it because my father was an art educator, and the institutions could better use it for future generations,\" she explains, adding that she's learnt so much more about her father's work because of the research done by the curators.\n\nSingaporeans have that one large mural to remember Lim by, but no art lover should miss the retrospective at Nafa, and also the capsule exhibition at NUS Museum which offers a fascinating insight and showcase of a Singapore artist.\n\nLim Mu Hue: The Inventive Life is on until May 18, at Lim Hak Tai Gallery, 80 Bencoolen Street, Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts Campus 1, Level 1. The gallery is open from 11am to 7pm (Tues to Sun), closed on Mondays.

Until then, Albedo said that the agreements remained valid and legally binding. It further added that the deal had not been terminated and that due diligence on the acquisition had begun.\n\nThe deal originally involved injecting seven parcels of land in Gelang Patah, Johor, spanning 268 hectares for $774.14 million. Albedo was to issue 34.55 billion new shares at 2.24 cents a share to pay for the land, which is earmarked for commercial, industrial and residential projects.\n\nIn December last year, it bumped up the planned acquisition through a supplemental agreement to another six plots of land covering 211 hectares, also in the vicinity of Malaysia's booming southern corridor. This doubled the deal size to $1.86 billion. This time, Albedo said that it would issue 39.5 billion shares at 4.7 cents a share to pay for the land.\n\nThere was very little not to like about that deal. Albedo, founded by chief executive Tai Kok Chuan, is not in the best of financial health, owing to its waning steel trading and distribution business. Revenue has been slipping; in the year ended December 2013, revenue fell 14 per cent and the firm continued to remain in red ink with a $1.17 million loss.\n\nThe Iskandar proposition for Albedo was therefore considered a life-line deal that would transform it from a dull and moribund steel company to a dynamic property builder.\n\nUnfortunately for Albedo, the deal hit a snag last month for reasons still not publicly known when Mr Tan's representatives asked to mutually terminate the plan in late March.\n\nAlbedo's latest announcement reveals that it is trying to keep the deal alive, but business publications in Malaysia hint that Mr Tan may be eager to can the deal.\n\nThe question is, should Mr Tan, a seasoned entrepreneur whose flagship firm is Malaysian-listed Tropicana Corp, walk out of the deal with nary a public statement?\n\n\"It's not fair. Of course, he's not legally bound to say anything but for such a big deal, it would help if there was some clarity from the Malaysian side on the deal's status,\" said a fund manager.\n\nAlbedo shares, which resumed trading yesterday afternoon following a trading halt on Wednesday pending the announcement, fell 13 per cent to 2.7 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But that didn't stop Adrian Cheong, 38, from starting The Philharmonic Winds in 2000 simply because he has a personal affinity for wind instruments.\n\nIn fact, Mr Cheong, who is now also the president of the ensemble, explains he's attracted by their versatility and unique sounds which help the orchestra expand their repertoire.\n\n\"We make it a point to do different kinds of music, like our Circus Maximus (by American composer John Corigliano) at the Esplanade Concert Hall last December, and then switched it around by performing some Hokkien songs in Tampines this March,\" he explains.\n\nMr Cheong himself has been playing the trombone since his secondary school days, and he decided to form the group together with some friends after they each graduated from their respective universities as a way of continuing their interest.\n\nTheir first concert in early 2001 was held at the Victoria Concert Hall, with some 40 performers in the ensemble.\n\nSince then, The Philharmonic Winds has come a long way - doubling to around 80 members - and even snagged some international awards such as a Gold Medal at the World Music Contest in The Netherlands in 2005, and second prize at the Certamen Internacional de Bandas de Musica - an international wind band contest in Spain last year.\n\nBut despite their accolades, Mr Cheong insists that competitions were never a main focus for them. \"It's really a 'by the way' kind of thing,\" he says.\n\nInstead, his vision for the orchestra is mainly to raise the profile of the wind orchestras and show more people what the instruments can do, while at the same time providing more opportunities for people who study music to have a platform for performing.\n\nAnd while it hasn't been an easy feat to juggle regular practice sessions with his full-time job as a corporate communications manager, Mr Cheong has stuck to his guns for the last 14 years simply because music has become an ingrained part of his life.\n\n\"It's almost an addiction, in a way,\" he says sheepishly. \"People have different hobbies, like sports for example - why some people run 40km, I'll never know. But I know they are passionate, and for us, making music is our passion. It just so happens that our medium is wind band music,\" he adds.\n\nFor more information, log on to\n\nwww.philharmonicwinds.org\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The two-for-five rights issue at two cents a share saw Mr Ching take up over 17 million rights shares, and an additional 15.2 million unsubscribed shares of Algotech, the vehicle through which executive chairman Philip Soh controls the company.\n\nMr Ching had earlier invested $5 million in Artivision via a convertible loan, at the conversion price of 20 cents per share, for 25 million shares. Subsequently, he purchased further shares in the open market, to increase his stake to over 43 million shares or 6.8 per cent of Artivision. His cost is estimated at about 15 cents per share. But this average would come down somewhat following his latest purchase of 32 million rights shares, which raises his Artivision stake to almost 76 million or 8.6 per cent. Mr Soh's stake is diluted to 23 per cent via 208 million shares, from almost 28 per cent via 175 million shares prior to the rights. All this comes after Artivision undertook a rights issue of up to 273.4 million new shares to raise gross proceeds of $5.46 million.\n\nMr Ching is now a non-executive director of Artivision. Still, at current levels, Artivision is far below its February 2012 highs of around 31 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Under the cross-carriage rule, exclusively obtained content must be made available to qualified competitors to cross-carry upon request.\n\nStarHub is already cross-carrying BPL matches from SingTel's mio TV under the cross-carriage rule, and will do the same with the 2014 World Cup in June.\n\nIf M1 qualifies to do the same, it will also be a contender to air these sporting events and any other content obtained exclusively by its competitors.\n\nThis is a big \"if\", for even after MiBox adds 10,000 subscribers to its fold, M1 will still need to apply for a nationwide Internet Protocol TV licence before it can apply to be a qualified receiver of cross-carriage content. How soon it can clear these regulatory issues and related technical requirements is anybody's guess.\n\nApproached by BT yesterday, M1 did not comment on the MiBox activation numbers, but said that take-up of the service since its launch last July has been \"encouraging\".\n\n\"We will seek regulatory approval to cross-carry exclusive content when we meet the criteria. This will enable us to offer content such as World Cup if it is made available under cross carriage,\" an M1 spokesman added.\n\nWhile M1 CEO Karen Kooi had said last October that MiBox might hit 10,000 subscribers by the middle of this year, the fledgling service appears to have set its sights above the 10,000-subscriber mark.\n\nLast year, M1 took delivery of 12,000 MiBox units, according to its supplier, set-top boxmaker Vodoke. In January this year, M1 is said to have ordered another 4,000 units, for delivery next month.\n\nEven before this development, M1 had made its BPL ambitions clear. Last July, M1 said that it had approached SingTel in order to better understand the technical requirements of cross-carrying exclusive content.\n\nWhile MiBox does not offer mainstream content such as HBO or National Geographic, gaining access to live football content might help it to crack a new market niche, one populated by cord-cutting viewers that do not watch conventional pay-TV, but want to watch football.\n\nAccording to Vodoke's CEO Michael Toh, 67 per cent of households that have subscribed to MiBox do not have a subscription with StarHub or mio TV.\n\nMiBox's entry will muddy the waters a tad for the two larger incumbents, StarHub and mio TV.\n\nThey will have to take into account MiBox's subscription fee of $8.56 and $12.84 for M1 fibre customers and everyone else, respectively, for a two-year contract.\n\nFor mio TV, MiBox's access to football content could encroach on the former's positioning as the home of the beautiful game.\n\nAt the same time, StarHub will no longer be the sole alternative for someone who wishes to watch the BPL or World Cup without subscribing to mio TV.\n\nEven beyond football, MiBox's entry into the cross-carriage stakes means that it could become a beneficiary of all kinds of other content negotiated on an exclusive basis by StarHub and mio TV.\n\nFor now, MiBox's reach is somewhat limited, in that the service is only available to homes that are fibre-ready. At the same time, regulatory criteria will have to be met. But those hurdles, like most other advantages that the incumbents have, will eventually be things of the past.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

What is behind these increased calls for gender diversity?\" Mr Gerald said, in an exclusive interview with The Business Times.\n\n\"Are we in a situation where women are putting up their hands, applying for positions on boards, and being rejected? I don't believe so. We need to first understand the situation, before we start crying foul.\"\n\nMr Gerald set up SIAS almost 15 years ago, to empower, educate and champion the rights of the investor community here.\n\nYesterday, he said that women do indeed lag men, in terms of their representation on boards, especially in Asia. But he added that this had more to do with women traditionally being less represented in senior and management positions in the workplace and being less forthcoming about wanting to serve on boards, because of family or other concerns, than it has to do with companies not wanting to appoint them.\n\n\"What Singapore needs to do is to first set up a register of women directors. Women, who are capable of being directors, of discharging the duties of a director, can put their names on this register if they wish to serve on boards. They can state their qualifications and even their preference for the kind of board they wish to serve on, the type of industry the company is in.\"\n\nMr Gerald suggested that such a register could be maintained by the Singapore Institute of Directors (SID) or the Singapore Exchange, or an independent women's organisation.\n\n\"Then, the effort could be made to reach out to listed companies, to see if they're looking for women directors; they could then use the register to see if there's someone who fits their requirements.\n\n\"Then, if these women - who put themselves up - are being rejected by boards and listed companies, or not given due consideration, that's when the task forces and other lobbyists can push their point about there being a need for greater gender diversity here, and they would then have the credibility to do so.\"\n\nHe also felt that gender diversity should not be a best practice guideline in the Corporate Governance Code or mandated in any way.\n\n\"The hands of the nominating committee (of the board) should not be tied that way. If shareholders want more women directors on their boards, or feel their boards are male-dominated, then let them speak up; let it come from the ground. Politics should not have a part in the boardroom.\"\n\nThe issue of gender diversity on boards has received much attention around the world in recent years. In Singapore, the Diversity Task Force, appointed by the government, recently released a study showing that women are under-represented on boards, while the NUS Business School released an annual report on such representation.\n\nMany corporate governance advocates and boardroom consultants feel, however, that true board diversity - where directors bring a range of experience, expertise and viewpoints to the board - is of greater benefit than gender diversity alone.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Cat A - for cars below 1,600cc and 130 hp - slipped $1,202 to $77,400, while Cat B - for cars above 1,600cc or 130 hp - climbed $1,604 to $84,504.\n\nCat E - the open category which currently tracks Cat B - inched up $99 to $84,100.\n\nMeanwhile, Cat D - for motorcycles - rose $200 to $4,489.\n\nThe sales manager of a volume dealership said that the Cat A premium would have fallen more if not for the strong demand for Mercedes-Benz CLA180 and A180 luxury models. \"After the February re-categorisation of Cat A, many models were forced to migrate to Cat B because of their higher engine output, so that should have resulted in a softening of the Cat A premium,\" he explained. \"Unfortunately, Mercedes-Benz still has three Cat A models.\"\n\nMore interesting, according to him, is the profile of these new Merc buyers. \"They are upgraders and they come from everywhere,\" he said. \"Toyota, Nissan, Honda, you name it, they're now moving over to the Mercedes brand.\"\n\nThe continuing healthy demand for cars despite the high COE premiums and the loan curbs is also apparently reflected in Cat B, said some dealers.\n\n\"The Mercedes-Benz E-Class, the BMW 5 Series and the Lexus ES are still receiving good orders,\" said the managing director of a luxury dealership. \"Even Jaguar and Volvo are seeing steady demand.\"\n\nHe attributed this to \"pent-up demand from wealthy people\".\n\nHe added: \"But it's also because the COE quota is small, so it doesn't take much to keep the Cat B premium up.\"\n\nLooking ahead, he believed the premium will be sustained \"at around this level\" for the near term. \"Any fluctuations should be in a narrow band,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/king-schmaltz-plays-waltz", "site_title": "King of schmaltz plays the waltz", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nKing of schmaltz plays the waltz\n\nCharismatic Andre Rieu conducts a 60-strong orchestra that excels in 'light music', writes GEOFFREY EU\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Apr 10, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nHE performs in sold-out stadiums across the globe, has dozens of CDs, DVDs and TV specials to his name and over a million followers on Facebook. With his shoulder-length curls and rock-star demeanour, 64-year-old Andre Rieu looks every inch the music celebrity - except he wears designer tuxedos on stage, his instrument of choice is an 18th-century stradivarius and his signature tune is the Blue Danube Waltz, composed in 1866.\n\nChances are you may not have heard of Rieu's band but the 60-strong Johann Strauss Orchestra is an essential part of every large-scale performance, together with dozens of singers and dancers in period costume - and oh yes, the horse-drawn carriages that make for an entrance to remember.\n\nIt's unclear if the horses will be in Singapore when he performs here for the first time next week, but the audience can expect Rieu to put on a show of epic proportions all the same.\n\nHis concert tours - featuring classical music, hits from musical theatre, the pop music lexicon and the \"light music\" waltzes for which he is famed - are extremely successful and regularly ranked among the top revenue-making acts by Billboard magazine, alongside conventional pop and rock groups.\n\nRieu has been accused of lowering the tone of classical music by making it accessible to the polo-shirt-wearing masses (dancing in the aisles at his concerts is not unheard of) and detractors have referred to him as the King of Schmaltz - not coincidentally a word that rhymes with waltz. Given the adoring fans and the level of success he's enjoyed since his first concert in 1988 however, Rieu will most likely be the one who has the last laugh (and the last waltz too).\n\nThe Dutch-born Rieu, who first took up the violin at five and had a conventional classical music education, shares the stage with a collection of international soloists and describes his extravagant, close to three-hour show as a musical journey around the world inspired by Johann Strauss, the 19th-century Viennese composer and the original King of Waltz.\n\n\"I play the lead violin and I conduct my orchestra and chorus and the soloists,\" says Rieu in a recent email interview. \"What makes it so special is the positive energy, the fun and the special connection we have with our audiences. I interact with them, I talk about the music and I tell little stories about my life.\" His music has a healing effect, he adds. \"We play 'music without problems' - I've had enough drama in my life, I don't need it on stage.\"\n\nWhat drama there is on stage is carefully choreographed, of course. \"I love to be creative, not just in the musical sense,\" says Rieu, who designs the costumes himself. \"Aren't you sometimes bored when you see 'normal' classical concerts? Some of them are so dull - why not add visual elements to emphasise the music?\" He adds, \"My father was a conductor and used to dress his musicians in Mozartian costumes during carnival season and the audiences loved it - maybe I inherited this from him.\"\n\nYears of routinely performing in front of huge audiences in castles (his own), famous concert halls and massive open-air stages haven't prevented Rieu from thinking even bigger - he has said he'd like to perform someday at the North Pole and even on the moon. Closer to reality, he does have a violin that most professional musicians can only dream of owning, made in 1732 by Stradivarius himself. \"I love this instrument, it reminds me of the opera singer Maria Callas - very passionate, he says. \"I used to play one from 1667, which was one of his first, but it was too small for me so I gave it to a young girl from Korea.\"\n\nThe first concert he ever saw - when he was three or four years old - also had a lifelong impact on Rieu.\n\n\"My mother took me to a concert where my father was conducting the symphony orchestra and for the first time in my life I heard that wonderful sound and saw all the bows going up and down at the same time. That made a huge impression on me and I wanted to be part of it.\"\n\nRieu cites his wife of 39 years Marjorie as the most important influence in his life - she introduced him to the joys of ABBA, after all - along with his first violin teacher, an 18-year-old blonde beauty. \"I was five years old and immediately fell in love with her - so I practised a lot, just to impress her.\"\n\nA few years after that, the eight-year-old Rieu experienced his true eureka moment. He was at one of his father's concerts and the audience was suitably respectful of the evening's programme of Beethoven and Mahler.\n\n\"But when his orchestra played the encore, something changed,\" says Rieu. \"People suddenly started to smile, it was magical - it was Strauss's most famous waltz By the Beautiful Blue Danube. Since then I have adored the waltz, because it can reach people in a way other music forms cannot.\"\n\nAndre Rieu and His Johann Strauss Orchestra Concert perform 'live' at the Singapore Indoor Stadium on Wednesday April 16 at 8pm.

Some plans are already in the works.\n\nIt recently formed a wholly owned subsidiary in Malaysia to manage the supply of granite and aggregate and set up its own fleet of tugs and barges to transport construction materials from overseas to Singapore.\n\nMr Ong said he hoped to sell 50 per cent of this granite supply to third parties.\n\nLian Beng is also planning to set up a new pre-mix plant by the end of this year, Mr Ong said, though exact details are not fixed yet.\n\nMr Ong said construction costs will rise given the new government requirements for developments at selected government land sites to use productive technologies and prefabricated components in new projects.\n\nBut Lian Beng will price in the higher construction costs into contracts with developers. For projects where Lian Beng is the developer and construction company, the group will factor in the higher costs through lower price bids for land sites from the government, Mr Ong said.\n\n\"We will still continue to tender for projects with better margins and go for projects with recurring income,\" Lian Beng executive director Ong Lay Koon said.\n\nOn that front, Lian Beng is interested in more commercial and industrial projects, she said.

According to industry officials, the shares were taken up by Malaysian funds, 60 per cent, and North American funds.\n\nSeadrill had a small interest in the Malaysian firm but increased it to 12 per cent after SapuraKenchana forked out US$2.9 billion in cash and shares early last year to acquire Seadrill's overseas rigs' tender business.\n\nThe deal seems fair by all accounts as another significant shareholder, Mokhzani Mahathir, had sold down 2 per cent late last year at the same price of RM4.30 a share. Mr Mokhzani still holds 10 per cent of the oil and gas firm.\n\nOn another level, both sales could be construed as profit-taking as SapuraKencana shares have appreciated tremendously over the last year. Even so, yesterday's dip in the firm's shares and the fact that Seadrill had been replaced by other institutional funds must have reassured investors.\n\nIn any case, Seadrill chairman and major shareholder John Fredriksen said in a statement on Wednesday that Seadrill had entered into a lock-up arrangement for its remaining stake in SapuraKencana, and would \"remain as a long-term strategic investor in the group\".\n\nAmResearch agreed. \"We believe that should Seadrill eventually dispose of its entire stake in SapuraKencana, it will be gradual given that Seadrill has a strong business relationship with the group through 50:50 joint ventures in six pipe-laying flexible support vessels, each potentially worth US$300 million,\" it said in a report yesterday.\n\nThe research house remained bullish on the stock. \"We maintain our buy recommendation on SapuraKencana with an unchanged fair value of RM5.70 a share, based on an FY15 PE of 22 times, which is the 2007 peak achieved by Kencana Petroleum.\"\n\nThe oil firm has been one of the biggest growth stories of the exchange largely because of the allure of the Malaysian oil and gas sector which has continued to receive large amounts of private investment.\n\nAfter its Seadrill rig purchase, the firm acquired Texas-based Newfields International oil and gas assets in Malaysia, vaulting it into the business of exploration and production and, given the reserves of Newfields' assets, making it the country's fourth largest oil and gas producer after Petronas, Shell and Exxon.\n\nIt has been a whirlwind rise for SapuraKencana. It was created only in 2012 through the merger of SapuraCrest Petroleum, owned by tycoon Shahril Shamsuddin, and Kenchana Petroleum, owned by Mr Mokhzani, a son of former premier Mahathir Mohamad, and his Chinese partners.\n\nBut successive share issues - for acquisitions - have pushed the firm's share base to over 5.9 billion units and the controlling shareholders have been diluted. Currently, there are four significant shareholders: Mr Shahril (17 per cent); the Employees Provident Fund (11 per cent); Mr Mokhzani (10 per cent), and Seadrill (8 per cent).\n\nIf AmResearch was bullish, CIMB was positively euphoric. Advising investors to \"accumulate\" the stock in an April 7 report, the bank pegged its target price at a whopping RM6.75 a share.\n\n\"SapuraKencana is the most dynamic company in our oil and gas portfolio, supported by a robust order book of RM25.4 billion (S$9.8 billion) which is set to expand as the company builds its capabilities in the key businesses,\" said CIMB.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It achieved some attention through the movie Cold Mountain, but it's hardly heard much outside otherwise.\n\n\"Shape-note music is a living tradition, and it is based on a social singing tradition rather than choir singing,\" explains Eriksen, who will be in Singapore for The Esplanade's Sacred Music Festival at the end of the month.\n\nThis shape-note music can be found along the eastern seaboard of the United States and goes back to the 1600s, he explains. Its original proponents weren't trained in classical music, and learnt music by ear. In shape-note music, much of the harmony is based on melody rather than chord progressions, he elaborates. \"Which is why it sounds like ballads.\" Eriksen lives in Western Massachusetts, but spent much time in the Appalachian in Alabama and Western North Carolina to study the music there. He was also in South India learning the veena and voice, and also Europe, namely Bosnia, to learn its pop music.\n\nIn short, he is the embodiment of the kind of multicultural influences on American music, and armed with a formal degree in musicology, is also fascinated with how musical influences have travelled in the world. \"I've often wondered how bagpipes travelled from India to Scotland,\" he shares, adding that the earliest bagpipe was found in India.\n\nThe historical and cultural connections in music are interesting, such as the similarity in instruments such as the American folk lap and hammer dulcimers to Asian stringed instruments.\n\nGrowing up with music-loving parents, the 40-something Eriksen caught the music bug early on. His very first gig was in punk rock before seguing into folk and world music. \"I still love the electric guitar, but I don't have much time for it these days,\" says the former frontman of Cordelia's Dad (folk-noise), Northhampton Harmony (shape-note quartet and Zabe i Babe (Bosnian folk and pop).\n\nIn Singapore, he performs with Zoe Darrow on the fiddle and Peter Irvine on percussion, in a band called The Trio of Pumpkintown. Of late, he's been more willing to experiment, Eriksen shares. \"I've been singing South Indian music for almost 30 years, it's natural that I'm influenced by it,\" he adds.\n\nOne highlight of his music career was perhaps to be handpicked as a consultant for Anthony Minghella's Cold Mountain - where he sung solo and also got together shape-note singers for some of the recordings.\n\n\"It turns out that there are very few male shape-note singers out there, and my name came up when they were looking for someone who could sing old ballads,\" he says, matter-of-factly. One of the thrills was to have his own infant son make a cameo appearance in the movie, he adds.\n\nBut as for the richness of shape-note music, it's still a strong musical tradition in the Appalachians because of the large families who sing them, and also outside influences the people bring in when they go out and return.\n\nTwo of the more well-known songs on Eriksen's playlist will be Wayfaring Stranger and Amazing Grace, which are unique combinations of European, African and Native American influences, he shares. \"It's a very different version of Amazing Grace... I hope the audience will like it.\"\n\nTim Eriksen and Trio de Pumpkintown will perform Folks Hymnody from the Eastern United States & the Appalachian Mountains on April 25, 7.30pm at The Esplanade Recital Studio.

We are willing to cooperate,\" Vanke president Yu Liang told a real estate forum in Hong Kong yesterday.\n\n\"We will make some big moves in M&A and equity investment,\" Mr Yu added.\n\nIn February, China's decision to sell a stake in a subsidiary of Sinopec Corp, Asia's biggest oil refiner, signalled more privatisation of its bloated state-owned sector will take place soon.\n\nVanke's comments come just a month after it said property prices in some Chinese cities are overheating. Weaker home price data and reports that developers have cut prices have also rattled investors.\n\nVanke has joined a host of Chinese developers in venturing overseas at a time when tighter liquidity is fuelling worries over the outlook for China's property market.\n\nMr Liu said Vanke's total overseas investment for the next five years would not exceed 10 per cent of the company's overall investment over that period.\n\nIn February, it announced it would team up with US developers RFR Holding and Hines on a residential tower in New York that will target high-end customers, its second project in the United States after it tied up with Tishman Speyer last year on a project in San Francisco.\n\nVanke also has investments in Singapore and Hong Kong.

The current fashion in wine is Burgundy - \"Burgundy Burgundy, everywhere... Nor any drop (of Bordeaux) to drink!\" - with apologies to Samuel Taylor Coleridge.\n\nRhone wines? Virtually neglected. To our loss. It was not always so. I am reminded of the time when Gerard Jaboulet was still alive. His annual visits to present the latest vintage of his wines, in particular Hermitage La Chapelle, kept local interest in Rhone wines very much alive. He was a great, and the most generous, of wine-men.\n\nI mentioned Chateau Rayas of Southern Rhone in this column many moons ago and his Cote du Rhone La Pialade a couple of weeks ago. This week it is the second wine to Chateau Rayas, Pignan. It is a little less rare than Rayas but nonetheless if you see one available just grab it. Ask for the price after you have it in your hands; yes, it is very affordable.\n\nPignan 2003\n\n100 per cent Grenache, like Rayas itself. Dinner at a Cantonese restaurant recently.\n\nVery dark red, with just a touch of brown at the edges. Attractive nose, very fresh, ripe fruit, berry and citrus fruit; mouth-filling palate, perfectly ripe berry fruit, dried fruit, cassis and black coffee. Most impressive were the taste of perfectly ripe fruit and black coffee and the long finish accompanied by great freshness which left the palate clean and fresh. A lovely wine, still youthful and capable of further development. Another four to six years.\n\n\"Pignan, made from a selection chosen after the Rayas selection has been made, can also be a terrific wine.\" (Robert M Parker, Jr. 'Wines of the Rhone Valley') Pignan is not just a lovely wine; it is great value for money. This 2003 is 10 years old, still so fresh. It could go on for another 10 in its present form. When one reflects that Pignan 2003 today costs 80 to 100 euros (S$138 to $173 ) a bottle compared to Rayas at 300 euros, it pulls you up short.\n\nThe relationship price-wise is similar to that between a Bordeaux First and its second wine, vide Latour and Les Forts. For a Chateauneuf-du-Pape that is a very startling bit of news. Mention Chateauneuf-du-Pape and in the past no one could ever imagine that there could be one which carries the same price as a Bordeaux First Growth.\n\nSadly the owner and wine-maker of Chateau Rayas, Jacques Reynaud, passed away in 1997.\n\nEgon Muller-Scharzhofberger Riesling Spaetlese 1999\n\nA white for a change and a German white. From one of Germany's finest winemakers, Egon Mueller Jr.\n\nLight golden yellow, a little darker than usual due to its 15-year-old age. Beautiful nose, restrained, well-mannered, light fruity. On palate, lightly sweet and fruity, balanced by delicate acidity and good minerality. A lovely drink to wash down the pepper crabs.\n\nWe tend to give too little thought to any whites apart from white Burgundy. Our loss. But it would be folly to accompany pepper crabs with a Puligny for instance.\n\nThe pepper would kill it. Sweetness is needed to assuage the tongue still smarting from the pepper. Hence a Spaetlese and not a Kabinett, which would not be sweet enough.\n\nAn Auslese could do. I have not yet tried it with pepper crabs. It may be too sweet for some palates not accustomed to accompanying food with sweet drinks. Will take the next opportunity to do so. (With a Spaetlese standing by!)\n\nPuligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clavoillon 1988 magnum, Domaine Leflaive\n\nPurchased London, Sept 1992. Leflaive is for most wine-lovers the finest producer of the Puligny group of white Burgundies. The Domaine makes three Premiers Crus, Clavoillon, Pucelles and Folatieres.\n\nThe finest of the three is Pucelles, and deservedly the most popular. Clavoillon is very different from Pucelles, a little broader in breadth and thicker in texture as opposed to Pucelles.\n\nA deep but slightly burnished golden colour with a glorious bouquet of very mature ripe wine, rich almost honeyed. On the palate a big wine, with good ripeness, density and concentration. A little blunt edge, good clean longish finish.\n\nBeing a magnum, and from a vintage, 1988, which notoriously takes an age to mature, preferably at least 10, I put it away out of sight. On second thoughts now after drinking it, I think it would have shown better if it had been opened five to seven years earlier. It was fresh all right, but only just.\n\nOne could say it was beginning to turn the corner although it drank beautifully, but I think it would have drunk even more beautifully five years ago.\n\nIncidentally I decanted this magnum about two hours before it was served. I prefer to decant old white Burgundies as (1) it gives the wine more time to breathe and to aerate itself; and (2) it shows off its glorious golden colour.\n\nDomaine Leflaive produces all three Puligny Premiers Crus, Clavoillon, Folatieres, and Pucelles. Of these the decidedly most popular and the finest is Pucelles. Clavoillon is rarely seen - an ugly duckling? Folatieres is also hardly seen, it being the smallest production-wise.\n\nAged white Burgundy is even more rarely seen, at least here in Singapore. I am not sure why. I personally prefer to age my white Burgundies. For Village five to six years, Premiers Crus at least eight to 10, preferably more, and for Grand Crus 10-plus years. If younger wines are needed, the Bourgogne Blancs and even the Macons are perfect for that.\n\nAt last, Bordeaux!\n\nChateau Haut Brion 2002\n\nPurchased en primeur 72 euros/bt, June 2003\n\nA good deep colour, still very red, with just a touch of brown at the edges. Beautiful aroma, very Bordeaux - cedary blackcurrant! On the palate, not a big wine, simply a very elegant slightly reserved gentlemanly wine; of medium density and weight, but well balanced. Blackcurrants, cassis and cedarwood, good ripeness, with just a touch of black coffee, very delicately complex, and a gentle lingering finish.\n\nVery typical Haut Brion. 2002 vintage, like 2001, coming on the heels of 2000 was not well received. Clive Coates gave it a rating of 1.5/20 for Graves, Margaux; 17.5/20 for St Julien, Pauillac & St Estephe. This bottle was beautiful, well exemplifying the faith one can have in the great properties, that whatever the vintage they will produce the best possible wine worthy of the property.\n\nBuying wine is rather like shopping for your daily food. You go to your favourite grocer, butcher, fishmonger and supermarket. You know what you want, you know the brands that are reliable, and you stick to them. And you are hardly ever disappointed.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But definitely, there is a situation for the large PSVs, where the order book is 37 per cent of the existing fleet. That might take some time to get rid of.\"\n\nHe said the resulting low utilisation rate and, hence, softer day rates would be in force \"for maybe 18 months or two years\".\n\nMr de Chateauvieux suggested that in the shallow-water segment, the demand-and-supply situation for PSVs and anchor handlers was generally well-balanced; less than 7 per cent of these vessels are on the order book, compared to the existing fleet.\n\nThe subsea market has no oversupply problem; it is still a growing market and, with the high barrier to entry, the threat of overcapacity will be minimised.\n\n\"It is a market where the unit investment is more than US$100 million. Therefore, it is less of a market where people will come on a speculation basis. So it is more professionally managed,\" he said.\n\nJaccar Holdings, the largest shareholder of offshore services provider Bourbon, is already using dual-fuel carriers, which means these vessels use liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a fuel where applicable.\n\nMr de Chateauvieux added that while using these carriers made sense, especially if they operated in Emissions Control Areas (ECAs), he was open to consider using dual-fuel technology for his offshore-support vessels (OSVs), but not on bunker vessels.\n\n\"Others in Norway have also done so, so we are learning as well,\" he said.\n\nThe Singapore Maritime Lecture is the anchor event of the ongoing Singapore Maritime Week, led by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This represents about one-third of Hong Kong's clearing volume.\n\nAs at April 8, 2014, the accumulated yuan clearing amount has exceeded 10 trillion yuan.\n\nClearing volume with mainland China of 640 billion yuan was recorded, it said.\n\nCurrently, 73 banks have opened yuan clearing accounts in Singapore, with clearing services covering 33 countries and regions.\n\nICBC Singapore's total assets and yuan deposits have seen a two-fold increase since the beginning of the year, it added.\n\nIn addition to providing secure and efficient clearing services to participating banks, ICBC Singapore offers yuan treasury products and liquidity support.\n\nIt will continue to introduce new products and new services, including the rollout of RMB bank notes delivery and developing RMB bond issuance, facilitating the bond proceeds and redemption as an agent.\n\nICBC Singapore last year issued the largest \"Lion City\" bond issuance. The two-year two billion yuan bonds priced at 3.2 per cent received orders hitting 5.2 billion yuan.\n\nThe issue by ICBC Singapore, wholly owned by ICBC, China's largest bank, was the first by a Chinese entity to issue a yuan bond cleared here.\n\nThe bank is also collaborating with Singapore Exchange to conduct research and development of RMB futures products and is planning to roll out USD/CNH and USD/CNY futures in July.\n\nSaid Mr Zhang: \"The bank will leverage on the strength of the group in RMB business. This will also help Singapore compete in the offshore RMB markets.\"\n\nWhile regulators downplay the rivalry among the various offshore yuan hubs, market players want to grab as much share as they can in the internationalisation of the currency of the world's second-largest economy.\n\nHong Kong is the undisputed market leader in the offshore yuan stakes but Singapore is banking on its edge as a financial centre and third-largest foreign exchange centre in the world - after London and New York - and the largest in Asia.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

When completed, it will have four dry docks, including one of the largest modern-designed docks in China.\n\nBesides shiprepair and conversion capabilities, the shipyard will also build offshore rigs, including jackups and semi-submersibles, said Keppel O&M yesterday.\n\nThe agreement is conditional on the completion of the on-going financial restructuring of Titan and the resumption of trading of its shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, said Keppel.\n\nKeppel O&M's chief executive Chow Yew Yuen said: \"The offshore oil-and-gas market in China has been growing significantly, and there is increasing demand for high-specification rigs and production vessels. At the same time, China is a market which has strong preference for China-made products.\"\n\nThe company has one other shipyard in China, Keppel Nantong, which undertakes specialised shipbuilding and offshore fabrication.\n\nBoth Keppel and Titan say they are optimistic about the growth potential of China's offshore and marine industry.\n\nChina's dependence on oil-and-gas imports increased from 43 per cent to 56 per cent in 2012, and is expected to go beyond 60 per cent in the coming years.\n\nWith its oil production on land having reached a plateau of 200 million tonnes annually, China is looking to expand its offshore oil-and-gas production to meet rising domestic energy demands. Offshore oil-and-gas production is targeted to double to 100 million tonnes a year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However, when they tried to enter the National Arts Music Competition a year later, they were told an ensemble of 20 musicians was required.\n\nTwelve more musicians were promptly recruited before the group went on to bag top prize in their first competition. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\n\"After that, we realised that we wanted to keep this up and become serious so we kept the musicians - mostly graduates from Nafa - and made 20 our standard size,\" says Dedric Wong, co-founder and general manager of Ding Yi.\n\nAlthough some musicians have come and gone, the majority have stayed on out of interest and Mr Wong, 27, admits that the decision to go pro after the competition has brought its fair share of challenges - mostly financial.\n\nAlthough Ding Yi has received two grants from the National Arts Council - the first in 2011 amounting to about $235,000 and a second, more major grant of $700,000 last year - he reveals that financial sustainability remains the biggest obstacle because the following for Chinese chamber music is rather niche.\n\n\"The first grant allowed us to build the company's foundation but the one from last year made a bigger difference. It allowed us to develop an administration,\" says Mr Wong. \"We (also) treat our musicians like professionals; paying them a salary. The other big cost comes from marketing concerts that we hold and inviting special guest musicians to perform with the company.\"\n\nAs the grant expires in about two years and chances of renewal are uncertain, Mr Wong says that the company is stepping up efforts to get its music heard by the masses, so in the worst-case scenario, they can still remain self-sufficient .\n\nTo raise their profile, Ding Yi organised the inaugural International Chinese Chamber Music Festival 2013 in Singapore; and is currently keeping itself busy with a line-up of programmes for the year.\n\nThe most immediate is a concert at the Esplanade next week entitled Virtuosos of Chinese Music, which will feature world-renowned musicians Yang Wei, Jiang Ke Mei and Wang Wei.\n\nMr Wong also expresses the importance of creating productions that are unique and attractive to the public. \"We need programmes that will sell and promote Chinese music. We're also concentrating on more original productions such as a multimedia concert with music composed by a local composer and incorporating calligraphy,\" he says.\n\nVirtuosos of Music will be held on April 19, 5pm at the Esplanade Concert Hall.

Limitless offered banks 200 million dirhams (S$68 million) in cash towards the payment, they said. The company wants to delay the repayment by a year.\n\nProperty prices in Dubai, one of seven sheikhdoms that make up the UAE, rose as much as 43 per cent last year, according to Cluttons LLC data on Bloomberg, amid a surge in trade and tourism.\n\nThe momentum cut the cost of borrowing for real estate companies including Emaar Properties PJSC and Nakheel PJSC, and prompted Damac Real Estate Development to sell US$650 million in a debut sukuk sale this month.\n\n\"Having a deferral so early after the restructure is not a very positive sign,\" Apostolos Bantis, a credit analyst at Commerzbank AG, said by phone from London. \"Growth in the emirate is not yet phenomenal enough to bring recovery to everyone.\"\n\nIn October 2012, Limitless announced it had signed a deal to extend a loan (due 2010) after two years of negotiations with creditors. The company is revisiting its business plan, chairman Ali Rashid Lootah said in London this week, and will speak to banks about the maturity.\n\nLimitless developments include mixed-use projects in Moscow, Vietnam and Dubai's Jebel Ali area, according to its website. A sale of land in Jebel Ali is among options being considered by the company, Lootah said April 7.\n\nA spokeswoman for Limitless said in an e-mailed statement on Tuesday that talks between the company and its lenders are private.\n\nDubai's improving economy is making life easier for developers and the banks they borrow from, which should make lenders more open to Limitless's proposal, according to Amol Shitole, a Bangalore-based analyst at SJS Markets Ltd.\n\n\"Things have changed in the last couple of years, and real estate companies are doing better,\" Mr Shitole said by phone yesterday. \"Thanks to the strong liquidity in local banks, lenders are more open to meet the requirements of these companies.\"\n\nDubai's economy expanded 4.9 per cent in 2013, the fastest pace since 2007. The cost of insuring the sheikhdom's debt against default fell to 165 basis points on Tuesday, near the lowest in more than five years.\n\n\"Limitless is a smaller company than the others,\" Mr Bantis said. \"Maybe the terms they secured were not as generous, so they feel more pressure right now.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

The floor is leased until year-end to a law firm.\n\nThis means Arch Capital will be exiting the 999-year leasehold office tower, having sold all its space on the 13th floor via four smaller strata units adding up to 13,110 sq ft between late 2012 and early 2013 at prices ranging from $2,920 psf to $3,150 psf.\n\nArch bought the two floors from Ho Bee for $2,550 psf in 2011.\n\nLast year, all six strata units on the 17th floor were transacted - at between $3,126 psf and $3,500 psf; the top end of this price range was for an 883 sq ft unit. The average price achieved for the floor (totalling 13,132 sq ft) worked out to $3,210 psf.\n\nThat space was sold by a partnership between Buxani Group and a group of investors advised by Seychelles-based Capital Management Group.\n\nThe same partnership is understood to be in discussion to sell the entire 18th floor to one buyer. The 13,132 sq ft space comprises six strata units leased to three tenants with lease expiries between late 2015 and early 2016.\n\nAs for the 14th floor, market talk is that there were indications of higher psf prices being offered for individual units on that floor though Arch preferred to divest all the four units to a single buyer - which makes sense as the entire space is leased to a single tenant.\n\n\"Buyers with $39 million to spend will pay a lower psf rate than the guy buying a quarter of a floor,\" said the head of investment sales at a leading property consulting group. \"To compare apples with apples, the trend line is still intact. On a whole-floor basis, office prices at Samsung Hub are still trending up, albeit at a moderate pace.\"\n\nThe latest full-floor deal - $3,030 psf for the 14th floor - is higher than the $3,000 psf achieved for the previous full-floor sale in the building, involving the 16th floor in late 2012, especially taking into account that the latest transaction involves a lower office floor (which typically commands a lower psf rate) and an inauspicious-sounding number in Chinese. The 16th floor transaction was in turn higher than the $2,800 psf that the entire 20th floor fetched in 2011.\n\nHad the 14th floor just transacted been vacant, a new benchmark may have been achieved (on full-floor basis) at Samsung Hub, suggest property agents.\n\nMarket watchers say the most aggressive buyers generally for completed strata office space today are those who want to use the premises in the near future. Such space tends to be more marketable as it appeals to this buyer profile.\n\nAn office floor that has a long-term tenancy may get sidelined as it would draw pure investors who tend to be less aggressive - given the higher entry price today and worries about interest rate hikes.\n\nOffice prices in Samsung Hub - on a whole-floor basis - have climbed from $2,125 psf on the lower levels (Levels 8, 9, 10 and 11) in 2010 to slightly above $3,000 psf currently as seen in the 14th floor transaction.\n\nThe Grade A office tower is regarded as one of the best quality, strata office plays in the prime Raffles Place financial district, especially given its rare 999-year leasehold tenure.\n\nOther completed quality CBD office buildings popular among strata investors include the 99-year leasehold Suntec City and Springleaf Tower. Upper floors in both developments command sea views.\n\nAt newer developments under construction such as the 99-year leasehold SBF Center along Robinson Road/Cecil Street, office units are said to have changed hands recently for as high as $3,550 psf for both part floors and full floors on upper levels of the 31-storey project.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That brings to four the number of pings found in the area.\n\nBut two US Navy officers told Reuters yesterday that while the pings had been found within a 1,300 square kilometre area, they were not confident that they represented recurrence of the same signal.\n\n\"I'd say they are separate acoustic events,\" said US Navy Captain Mark Matthews, citing the fact that the pings were not close together.\n\n\"There has been variability in the geographic position which leads me to be less optimistic than I would be if I could consistently reacquire the signal so that I have a nice, small geographic area to focus the autonomous under water vehicle search on,\" he added.\n\nThe process of teasing out those signals from the cacophony of background noise in the sea is a slow and exhausting process, experts say.\n\nOperators must separate a ping lasting just 9.3 milliseconds - a tenth of the blink of a human eye - and repeated every 1.08 seconds from natural ocean sounds, as well as disturbances from search vessels.\n\n\"The ocean is a noisy place,\" said Mike Davis-Marks, former commander of a sister vessel to British hunter-killer submarine HMS Tireless which has been dispatched to assist in the search. \"There is noise from everything, whether it's the ambient noise of the weather at the surface, or marine life like whales or the snapping noise of shrimps, not to mention other sea transport and low-flying aircraft.\"\n\nAlthough the batteries in the black box recorders are thought to have a lifespan of roughly 30 days, officials have said they can last for as long as two weeks beyond that time.\n\nThat meant the search was becoming even more of a race against time, said Mr Houston. \"I mean, we are looking at this stage for transmissions that are probably weaker than they would have been early on because the batteries of both devices are passed their use-by date and they will very shortly fail,\" he explained.\n\nAn autonomous underwater vehicle named Bluefin-21 is onboard the Australian navy vessel the Ocean Shield, which is helping in the search, and it could be sent to look for wreckage on the sea floor once the search area is narrowed down. The search could be conducted at a depth of about 4.5 km, the outer reach of the Bluefin's range.\n\nFurther complicating matters, Mr Houston said, is that the ocean floor there is believed to be covered in a thick layer of silt that could further obscure what is already expected to eventually be a technically challenging visual search.\n\nDespite the new signals, Mr Houston insisted that search teams should exhaust the capability of planes and vessels before deploying underwater vehicles.\n\n\"Bear in mind, that the time spent on the surface we're covering six times more area and any given time than we'll be able to do when we go underwater,\" he added. \"So with the batteries likely to fade or fail very shortly, we need to get as much positional data as we can so that we can define a very small search area.\" - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The capital gain on bonds, excluding interest, has been 46 per cent while Spain's IBEX 35 stock index has jumped by 79 per cent and was recently up by as much as 85 per cent. Such is the euphoria of yield-hungry US and other foreign investors that five-year Spanish debt, currently trading at 1.73 per cent, briefly dipped below five-year US Treasuries, last week. eDreams Odigeo SA, a large Spanish online travel reservation company was listed this week, the first initial public offering in three years. The stock fell sharply on its market debut, but its market capitalisation was still as much as 1 billion euros (S$1.73 billion).\n\nA threat to fund manager enthusiasts of euro and European securities would be potential dimming of rose-tinted spectacles in Spain. To be sure, the nation's economic and financial facts remain bleak even though the spin from the government, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and several US and European investment banks is \" continued recovery\".\n\n\"Spain has turned the corner. Growth has resumed in the second half of 2013 after more than two years and unemployment and employment are now gradually improving,\" said Olivier Blanchard, chief economist at the IMF. \"Financial and economic conditions have improved significantly. In fact, Spain's exports have grown faster than Germany's since the crisis - helping to post a current account surplus for the first time in 20 years.\"\n\nImprovements to the financial health of banks, more flexible labour markets and stronger controls of government and regional spending helped pave the way to a stronger economy and improved business confidence, according to Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF.\n\nMoreover, there are anecdotal reports that foreigners are again buying property in the depressed real estate market. Foreign direct inward investment fell from around 52 billion euros in 2008 to around 7 billion euros in 2009, but it recovered to 30 billion euros in 2013.\n\nAlthough Spain's economy has revived, the scale is tiny and the improvement comes from an exceedingly depressed base.\n\nSpanish bulls remark that industrial output rose 2.8 per cent in February after increasing in the preceding three months. The production increase this year, however, followed 20 months of declines and both production prices and new orders continue to fall. The country is experiencing deflation as Spanish consumer prices dipped 0.2 per cent in March. The fear is that both producer and consumer deflation will cause companies to delay employment-creating direct investment.\n\nJob creation is essential considering that the overall unemployment has only fallen by 1 percentage point to 26 per cent and youth unemployment from 57.4 per cent to 56.6 per cent. It is therefore hardly surprising that Luis Mar\u00eda Linde, a European Central Bank (ECB) board member and the governor of Spain's central bank, said last week that quantitative easing (QE), notably more monetary easing, may be necessary to counter deflation.\n\nThe IMF and government point out that debt is falling, but it is still at uncomfortably high levels. Government debt as a proportion of gross domestic product is 86 per cent and including bond redemptions, the government borrowing requirement is a hefty 242 billion euros. This includes 133 billion euros of medium and long-term debt, of which only a quarter so far has been issued to the market.\n\nAlthough the IMF says that the finances of Spanish banks has improved, it admitted in a recent report that they were major buyers of Spanish government bonds and could thus be vulnerable if bond yields rose.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A day later on Friday, AusGroup called for a trading halt and responded that \"a party\" had informed the company that it had bought a substantial 6.9 per cent stake and that it was verifying the information.\n\nThat party, as the market got to know later through a Tuesday filing to SGX, happened to be Ezion. AusGroup shares resumed trading just before noon yesterday; buoyed by the news, the counter finished 23 per cent up at 51 cents.\n\nThe exuberance wasn't mirrored in Ezion's shares, which fell 0.5 per cent to $2.10.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With 90 per cent of the vote counted, PDI-P had 19.8 per cent, based on a tally by Lingkaran Survei Indonesia (LSI) shown on TVOne. LSI has monitors at polling stations during the vote count, with final results not due from the General Elections Commission, or KPU, until May 9.\n\nGolkar, the party of tycoon Aburizal Bakrie, 67, had 14.6 per cent of the vote and Gerindra, whose candidate for president is former general Prabowo Subianto, 62, had 11.8 per cent, according to LSI. The Democratic Party of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono stood at 9.7 per cent, it said. The country's five Islamic-based national parties looked to have grabbed a combined 32 per cent share of the national vote, performing slightly better than in the last parliamentary election in 2009, according to a quick count by think-tank CSIS.\n\nMore than 185 million people were eligible to vote yesterday for the 12 parties contesting across the South-east Asian archipelago, the world's third-biggest democracy. With parties needing 20 per cent of seats or 25 per cent of the total vote to stand a presidential candidate on their own, the count suggests PDI-P will now start the process of forming a coalition. Jakarta Governor Widodo, 52, known as Jokowi, leads opinion polls for president.\n\nMr Widodo may have to align with parties he hoped to exclude from a coalition, according to Marcus Mietzner, an associate professor at the Australian National University in Canberra and author of \"Money, Power and Ideology: Political Parties in Post-Authoritarian Indonesia\".\n\n\"Instead of a small, effective coalition centred on a strong PDI-P, he now faces the prospect of a fragmented, multi-party coalition,\" he said by email. \"The dynamics of the presidential race itself remain unchanged: exit polls taken today demonstrated that Jokowi would have won the elections with a large margin.\"\n\nPDI-P had 19 per cent of the vote, ahead of Golkar on 14.8 per cent, according to polling company Saiful Mujani Research & Consulting, based on results from voting booths in its survey. Other polls showed PDI-P at less than 20 per cent with a narrow lead over Golkar.\n\n\"We don't want to talk about coalitions, we want to talk about cooperation to resolve the big problems of this big nation,\" Mr Widodo said in a broadcast on Metro TV. He was then joined in a panel by former vice-president Jusuf Kalla of Golkar, State-Owned Enterprises Minister Dahlan Iskan, of the Democratic Party, and Jakarta Deputy Governor Basuki Purnama, of Gerindra.\n\nA Roy Morgan poll of 1,965 people released on April 4 had showed PDI-P would be the only party to meet the presidential threshold, winning 37 per cent of seats, up from the almost 17 per cent it now holds. Golkar came in at 17 per cent and Gerindra at 14 per cent.\n\nRupiah forward prices reversed an early gain to decline as much as 0.5 per cent yesterday as the preliminary estimates were released. Indonesia markets were closed yesterday and will reopen today.\n\nThe result shows an absence of the \"Jokowi effect\" that may have come because PDI-P didn't do a good enough job of associating him with the party, said Paul Rowland, a political analyst based in Jakarta who was formerly Indonesia country director for the National Democratic Institute, a non-government advocacy group.\n\n\"I think it would be a serious disappointment for them if they fall short of 20 per cent of the seats in the house,\" Mr Rowland said. \"It may mean that you have a two-round election instead of a single-round presidential election.\"\n\nThe Democratic Party of Mr Yudhoyono, who is unable to stand again after two terms, was forecast to get 10 per cent of seats in the election, the Roy Morgan survey found, down from about 26 per cent in 2009. Mr Yudhoyono governs with a coalition of five other parties.\n\nStocks and the rupiah rallied after Mr Widodo's candidacy was announced last month, on optimism he will get things done on issues from infrastructure to tax collection, to bolster South-east Asia's biggest economy that grew at the slowest pace in four years in 2013.\n\nLawyer Heri Marwan, 49, voted for PDI-P in Bandar Lampung, a city in southern Sumatra island and the main port for the country's coffee exports. The election is Indonesia's fourth since the fall of dictator Suharto in 1998.\n\n\"As an opposition party PDI-P rejected many non pro-people policies, that is a good show of their commitment as a party for the grassroots,\" he said. \"We can see that when they rejected the fuel price increase.\" In a nation where the major parties have similar views on issues from the economy to resource management, party campaigns focused on pushing individuals rather than laying out policy platforms.\n\n\"It is too often not about voting for the best, but for the least bad,\" said Leony Aurora, a 35-year-old environmental consultant, as she prepared to vote in the city of Bandung on Java island. \"I want to make sure that we'll at least have a candidate I could vote for in the presidential election,\" she said. \"Where the country is going is really up in the air.\"\n\nSome Indonesians chose not to vote. Yossie, 53, who works as a finance official for a company in Bandung and goes by one name, said she went on holiday instead in Bali.

But if we can get the High Speed Rail between Singapore and KL built, whether it is (by) 2020 or whether it is a bit later, I think it will make a very big difference to the connection between two very vibrant cities, in the way you can do business together, in the way you can travel up (and) down, the convenience of it,\" he said.\n\nSingapore and Malaysia have set a 2020 deadline to complete the 320km to 340km rail project, which will shuttle passengers from Singapore to KL in just 90 minutes.\n\nKey areas such as how the HSR will be built, the engineering involved, the financing models, governance and legal framework have all yet to be worked out, said Mr Lee.\n\n\"These are all very complicated to do even in one country, but to do in two countries, and to work it all out in what would be quite a compressed time frame, I think will test our teams,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked by a Malaysian editor if Singapore and Malaysia would select a committee to run the project or if a private company would do so, Mr Lee would only say that this was another issue that would need to be addressed.\n\nIn the wide-ranging session, Mr Lee was quizzed on issues including the political turmoil in Thailand, the haze problem that plagues South-east Asia every year, and his experience with the use of social media such as Facebook.\n\nWhen asked about his own political future and how long he planned to remain as Singapore's prime minister, Mr Lee said that leaders should stay as long as they are able to make a contribution.\n\n\"In Singapore, we pay a lot of attention to succession planning and making sure that we have a new team ready, and new leaders who are capable of taking charge, so that the country can move ahead and the leaders can be in sync with the country,\" he said.\n\n\"I can't say exactly how long I am staying, but I am 62 years old and that's not young,\" said Mr Lee.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Also in the works from the Singapore investment firm is a retail bond offering in the near future.\n\nTemasek yesterday launched Astrea II, a co-investment vehicle with broadly diversified holdings in 36 private equity funds.\n\nTemasek is the single largest investor in Astrea II, at 38 per cent; ARDIAN, formerly AXA Private Equity - a global private investment company and leading secondary fund manager - is one of the six co-investors in Astrea II.\n\nThe name of Temasek's latest SPV references that of its first, Astrea - through which it securitised its investments in 46 private equity (PE) funds in 2006. Astrea I bought Temasek's interests in the funds, then sold around US$810 million in equity and 15-year, floating-rate debt securities to sophisticated investors, including financial institutions.\n\nExplaining the firm's decision for another such vehicle now, Temasek's head of Enterprise Development Group, Dilhan Pillay Sandrasegara, said: \"Launching Astrea I in 2006 gave us an opportunity to start exploring how to broaden our co-investor base, starting with long-term institutional investors. With the world recovering from the troughs of the global financial crisis, we assessed that it was timely for the next Astrea co-investment product, and are now very pleased to have six high-quality and like-minded long-term institutional co-investors with us in the Astrea II portfolio.\"\n\nLike Astrea I, Astrea II comprises a carefully selected portfolio of good quality private equity funds, balanced across vintages, geographies and sectors, Temasek's press release yesterday added.\n\nTemasek did not reveal further details of the SPV yesterday.\n\nBut Mr Sandrasegara did say: \"Temasek will remain actively engaged with the PE funds that have been injected into the Astrea II platform. Outside of Astrea II, we continue to manage a large and growing portfolio of private equity fund interests. We are very pleased with the excellent relationships we have with the General Partners (GPs) of these top quality PE funds. We have stepped up our engagement with them, especially over the last couple of years, to explore new opportunities and models for private equity investments. Our strategy for investing in private equity funds is, and will continue to be, an important complement to Temasek's direct investing activities.\"\n\nLike Astrea I, the second offering also appears geared towards the upper echelons of the investing community, ie the high net worth individuals and the more sophisticated investors.\n\nStill, it is clear that Temasek is keen to broaden its investment base, with a view to including other tiers of retail investors in future, especially with its plans for a retail bond issue soon.\n\nLee Theng Kiat, president of Temasek, said: \"One of Temasek's long-held aspirations is to have long term-minded retail investors, especially retail investors in Singapore, co-invest alongside us. We are naturally mindful of their risk-return preferences. This is why we hope to start by offering Temasek Bonds to retail investors, when there is a suitable opportunity to do so, and phase in higher risk return investment opportunities at a later stage.\"\n\nHe added: \"Platforms such as Astrea I and Astrea II are part of our phased approach to developing co-investment products. They help us test market interest and fine-tune our thinking and product positioning for eventual participation by retail investors. When we are ready to launch suitable products for the retail market, we hope that retail investors in Singapore will welcome such opportunities to co-invest with us.\"\n\nThe news was welcomed by David Gerald, president and chief executive of the Securities Investors Association (Singapore), the main retail investor lobby group here.\n\n\"Retail investors are always looking for better returns in safe investments, and I'm glad that Temasek is casting its net wider to include the retail investor base. I support this initiative,\" said Mr Gerald.\n\nTemasek's portfolio value was $215 billion as at March 31, 2013, and it remains primarily a direct equity investor with about a tenth of its portfolio in third party managed funds.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

About 300 people who work in back-office roles will be affected, the person said. Barclays declined to comment in an emailed response.\n\nIt follows a similar move by the bank earlier this year when it exited Changi Business Park, another suburban office in the island-state, and relocated about 200 employees to the downtown office. Antony Jenkins, who replaced Robert Diamond as the London-based bank's chief executive officer in 2012, is eliminating 12,000 jobs to curb costs and boost profitability.\n\n\"If you don't have the size or scale, it's better to be operating from one building,\" said Donald Han, managing director of Chesterton Singapore, a real estate consultancy. \"The decision could be one of scale, one of efficiency and of being able to consolidate under one roof despite current rentals being higher at MBFC.\"\n\nMonthly rents at Marina Bay Financial Centre are now S$11 to S$12 a square foot, compared with around S$10 to S$11 per square foot when Barclays moved into the building in 2011, said Mr Han. The bank may have gotten a \"big discount\", considering the size of the space it leased, he said. That compares with as much as S$8 to S$9 per square foot monthly rent, including disaster recovery and data centres, at the building in Tampines, from which Barclays is vacating, he said.\n\nOnce the move from Tampines is completed, Barclays, which runs businesses including corporate banking and wealth management, will have a total of two offices in Singapore, including One Raffles Quay, also in the Marina Bay area.\n\nIt occupies about 290,000 square feet at Marina Bay Financial Centre, part of the 360-hectare Marina Bay development that Singapore started building in 2005 on reclaimed land located in the southern part of the country. It has another 96,000 square feet at One Raffles Quay, according to Barclays.\n\nBarclays had 4,700 staff in Singapore, according to data provided by the bank in September 2012. In October last year, it employed 3,500 full-time employees, according to a press release marking 40 years in Singapore.\n\nReturn on average equity at Barclays' securities unit, a measure of profitability, fell to 8.2 per cent last year from 13 per cent in 2012, compared with Mr Jenkins' target of at least 11 per cent in 2015.\n\nCompensation as a proportion of investment banking revenue rose to 43.2 per cent last year from about 40 per cent the previous year. That compares with the 35 per cent target Mr Jenkins set for 2015. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

The airline chose to expand Germanwings rather than surrendering the routes to the likes of low-cost carriers Easyjet and Ryanair Holdings, she said.\n\nLufthansa is in the process of shifting large parts of its European network to Germanwings after years of losses on shorter routes outside the main Frankfurt and Munich hubs. Europe's former flag carriers have struggled to make money on short-haul, with Ryanair and Easyjet offering lower fares, coupled with a fresh focus on service that makes them more attractive.\n\nGermanwings is \"very, very well positioned\" in the domestic market as the unit manages a high frequency of flights from various regional airports, Ms Menne said. In Hamburg, Germanwings will have more competition after EasyJet recently opened a base. Germanwings will add Rome and Prague as well as Thessaloniki, Greece and Toulouse, from the city this year.\n\nLufthansa's Brussels Airlines unit, in which it holds a 45 per cent stake, faces strong competition from Easyjet, Ryanair and Vueling Airlines at its home base, Ms Menne said.\n\n\"The fight of low-costers at the same location will have an impact on Brussels,\" the CFO said. \"We had planned a break-even in 2015, we must see how the competitive situation evolves in Brussels.\"\n\nBrussels posted a loss of 21.95 million euros (S$37.85 million) last year, after a deficit of 59.9 million euros in 2012. Lufthansa has the option of buying the remaining 55 per cent in Brussels by 2017, Ms Menne said.\n\nFollowing the worst strike in Lufthansa history last week, the management plans a \"swift solution\" with pilots on pension pay, Ms Menne said. Whether the expected \"high double digit million\" cost from the strike will hurt full-year remains to be seen, she said. It will resume talks with Vereinigung Cockpit pilots union today, airline spokesman Christoph Meier said on Tuesday.\n\nFor now, Lufthansa will stick to its target to lift operating profit to 2.65 billion euros by 2015, Ms Menne said. The company earned 697 million euros in operating profit for last year, it said on March 13.\n\nThe three-day pilot strike, which ended last Friday, could do \"a real damage\" to the company if passengers refrain from booking Lufthansa in the coming months as they fear disruptions, Ms Menne said.\n\nLike European rivals, Lufthansa has pursued cost and revenue sharing pacts, teaming with United Continental Holdings on trans-Atlantic flights, All Nippon Airways in the Germany-Japan market and seeking a deal with Air China. The company is optimistic that it will reach a joint venture agreement with Air China \"in the medium term\", Ms Menne said.\n\n\"It is very complex, as we need to agree on routes, conditions and there are also cartel issues, which in the Chinese context is a rather long-term issue,\" she said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Similar to established players Kickstarter and Indiegogo, Crowdtivate will be a platform for entrepreneurs and artists to get financial help from just about anyone with money to spare.\n\nThis platform will be jointly managed by Star-Hub i\u00b3 and its partner, Crowdonomic - a local technology solutions and strategic advisory firm.\n\n\"Crowdfunding is an extremely popular way for the global community to connect with artists and entrepreneurs, and for them to participate in bringing great ideas to life,\" said Stephen Lee, head of Star-Hub i\u00b3. \"With Crowdtivate, we aim to tap into a continuous source of innovative and creative ideas from local inventors, and ultimately help them grow as a future business or incorporate them into our service platforms.\"\n\nWhile other crowdfunding sites might stay out of the development process, Crowditivate plans to be more involved.\n\n\"We may even invest in, form a partnership with or bring the start-ups to overseas markets through our telco partners in Asia Pacific,\" StarHub's Mr Lee said.\n\nThe top three monthly Crowdtivate campaigns will receive exclusive assistance, including access to test users, marketing support, startup funding and free software development, among other things.\n\nCrowdtivate, now in its beta launch phase, will be open in May for supporters and backers to examine and fund projects that catch their fancy.\n\nYesterday, SingTel also announced that it is marshalling its venture capital (VC) troops under a regional umbrella, called Innov8 Sparks.\n\nThis regional alliance builds on the existing work of SingTel Innov8, a corporate VC fund that was set up in 2010 with an initial fund size of $200 million.\n\nNow, Innov8 Sparks will bring together the VC funds from SingTel's associates - Thailand's AIS The Startup, the Philippines' Kickstart Ventures by Globe, Australia's Optus-Innov8 Seed and Indonesia's Telkomsel Teman-Dev - as founding members alongside SingTel Innov8.\n\n\"Innov8 Sparks will provide assistance to eligible start-ups to expand outside their respective home markets, into Australia, Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand,\" SingTel said yesterday. \"Start-ups in the Innov8 Sparks programme will have access to working space, introductions to local partners and start-up communities, as well as local market information and resources.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The nation is emerging from a six-year economic crisis that almost forced it to leave the euro.\n\n\"There has been a huge shift in sentiment and, after sniffing around for quite a while, investors are now anxious to dig up Greek opportunities,\" Mr Taprantzis said. \"Look how stocks have performed.\"\n\nThe Athens Stock Exchange General Index has jumped 175 per cent since reaching a 22-year low in June 2012 and the economy is set to grow this year for the first time in seven years. The country's bonds returned 23 per cent in the first quarter, the best among 34 sovereign debt markets tracked by Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.\n\nGreece is selling everything from land to ports and airports as part of a 240 billion euro bailout from Europe and the IMF. The asset fund has a mandate to raise 11 billion euros by 2016. The original target after the first bailout in 2010 was for 50 billion euros by 2015.\n\n\"It is a buyers' market, with low price levels that will allow for strong potential capital gains,\" said Spyros Raptis, manager of valuations and planning at Athens-based real estate adviser Redvis. \"The expected economic recovery and growing activity will definitely lift up real estate returns.\"\n\nLast month, the fund agreed to sell Hellenikon, a former airport site that's almost twice the size of New York's Central Park, to a group of investors led by Lamda Development for 915 million euros. In December, the fund and the National Bank of Greece SA accepted a 400 million euro bid from the Jermyn Street Real Estate Fund IV for 90 per cent of Astir Palace, a luxury seaside hotel complex in an Athens suburb.\n\nPangaea REIC, the real estate investment trust owned by Invel Real Estate Partners and the National Bank of Greece SA, aims to raise about one billion euros by the end of 2014 to invest in Greek and Italian real estate assets.\n\n\"Apart from privatisation plans, we are identifying signs of growing activity in the field of indirect real estate investments,\" Mr Raptis said, \"The plans of Pangaea as well as other deals show that investors have started to consider their positions in the Greek market.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

Five US carriers - American, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and United Continental Holdings - have said disruptions from snow and ice storms forced them to cancel at least 78,000 flights collectively.\n\nUnited disclosed after markets closed on Tuesday that it cancelled about 35,000 flights in the first quarter, most of them at regional carriers.\n\nIt added the weather-related flight cancellations hurt passenger revenue per available seat mile, or unit revenue, which decreased between 1.5 and 2.5 per cent compared with the 2013 first quarter.\n\nDelta said earlier this month that it cancelled 17,000 flights in the first quarter, reducing profit by US$55 million and shaving US$90 million from quarterly revenue. Delta cut its operating margin forecast to 6.5-7.5 per cent from 6-8 per cent, but said that measure would still top the year-earlier first quarter's 3.5 per cent.\n\nRobert Mann, an aviation consultant in Port Washington, New York, said new US rules requiring more rest for pilots also spurred cancellations. He said the shift of the Easter holiday to April this year from March in 2013 would likely hurt the first quarter while aiding second-quarter results for airlines. \"The demand environment looks pretty strong,\" he said.\n\nJP Morgan analyst Jamie Baker cut his first- quarter profit estimate on American to 51 US cents a share from an earlier 63 US cents, citing the carrier's revised forecast. He raised his second-quarter estimate to US$1.65 from US$1.48, citing strong demand.\n\nAmerican Airlines, formed by the December merger of AMR Corp and US Airways, also said on Tuesday that it would eliminate free checked bags for passengers with full-priced economy tickets and make other changes to its baggage and loyalty programme mileage redemption policies.\n\nThe carrier said the no-free-checked-bag policy would also apply to travellers redeeming AAnytime miles under the American loyalty programme. Some higher-level frequent fliers in the American and US Airways loyalty programmes will be allowed one less free checked bag, it added.\n\nAt the same time, American is lowering the amount of miles required for loyalty programme members to get free travel to 20,000 miles one way from 25,000 miles for most of the year. For some of the busiest travel days, such as the Sunday after Thanksgiving, 50,000 miles will be needed for frequent fliers to redeem free flights. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The capital-boosting exercise comes amid its acquisition of Hong Kong's Wing Hang Bank for $6.23 billion announced on April 1; it is also the last of the three local banks to issue Basel III-compliant capital.\n\nDarren Tan, OCBC chief financial officer, said that the issuance was expected to qualify as Tier 2 capital under the Monetary Authority of Singapore's Basel III framework, and will improve its total capital adequacy ratio (CAR) as at Dec 31, 2013, by about 0.8 percentage point.\n\n\"It augments our capital position and places us well to capture growth opportunities, which include the possible pre-conditional voluntary general offer to acquire Wing Hang Bank,\" he said.\n\nOCBC has said that it would raise capital and maintain CAR at prudent levels post-acquisition. Its total CAR will fall to 12.5 per cent from 16.3 per cent prior to any capital raising.\n\nLast month, OCBC redeemed $712 million of Tier 2 subordinated notes. This redemption was undertaken to improve the capital efficiency of our \"old-style\" capital instruments, he said.\n\nOCBC has a redemption option in November this year for an outstanding US$500 million of 4.25 per cent Tier 2 subordinated notes. Regulatory approval for the redemption of these notes will be required, he said. \"Should we look to redeem these notes, we will make the relevant announcement closer to the redemption date.\"\n\nUnder Basel III rules, bank investors must share the burden in the event of a bank failure before public money is used to rescue the bank, which means that the bonds have a loss-absorbing feature.\n\nUnited Overseas Bank (UOB) was the first Asian bank to issue Basel III bonds, beginning in July last year, with $850 million of perpetual securities. It followed up in November with $500 million of perpetual securities. Both deals qualified for Tier 1 capital. Last month, UOB raised US$800 million from subordinated bonds that qualified as Tier 2 capital under the Basel III framework.\n\nDBS Group Holdings launched its maiden Basel III issue in November - $800 million of perpetual securities.\n\nYesterday's sale by OCBC was priced at 99.4 per cent with a coupon of 4 per cent per annum from the issue date to the call date on Oct 15, 2019. If the notes are not redeemed on the call date, the interest rate from the call date to the maturity date on Oct 15, 2024, will be reset to a fixed rate per annum equal to the aggregate of the then-prevailing five-year US dollar mid-swap rate and 2.203 per cent. Proceeds from the issuance will be used for general corporate purposes of the bank, said OCBC.\n\nHSBC, JP Morgan (SEA) Limited, Merrill Lynch (Singapore) Pte Ltd and OCBC Bank were joint lead managers and joint bookrunners for the issue. Orders for the issue reached US$4.3 billion, with investors from Asia making up 44 per cent, the US (40 per cent) and Europe (16 per cent).\n\nThe majority of investors were asset and fund managers which took 68 per cent of the deal, while insurance and private banks got 10 per cent each, and sovereign wealth funds and banks picked up 8 per cent and 4 per cent respectively.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Fitch Ratings, the rating agency that downgraded the outlook for the Malaysian sovereign last July, has been sufficiently concerned to flag household debt as a downside risk for future bank ratings.\n\nBut the available data indicate otherwise, signalling that macro-prudential measures instituted by both the central bank and the government are actually working. Although its absolute quantum remains distressingly high, growth in household debt has eased to its slowest pace since 2010. Not if you go by the absolute percentages though. Total household debt inched up to 86.8 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2013 from around 80 per cent in 2012.\n\nBut what's notable is that the rise had more to do with the sharp fall in nominal GDP growth last year - to 4.6 per cent, from over 7 per cent in 2012 - than any rise in borrowings. In fact, growth in household borrowings declined to 11.7 per cent in 2013 from 13.5 per cent in 2012. The central bank now also has more powers to deal with runaway debt. The Financial Services Act, which gives Bank Negara Malaysia more oversight over non-bank financial enterprises (NBFEs), came into force in the middle of last year. NBFEs, which have captured around 58 per cent of the personal loans' market, have driven the spike in personal loans. But the Act has allowed Bank Negara Malaysia to stem the NBFE boom. As a result, lending to households by these institutions, such as Bank Rakyat and the Malaysian Building Society, halved in 2013.\n\nFully 44 per cent of household credit is in mortgages - a reasonably safe bet - while 18 per cent go towards vehicle financing, which is less safe but still well collateralised. Moreover, growth in household credit, as a proportion of all credit, is also moderating, declining to 11.7 per cent in December 2013 and then further to 10.3 per cent in January 2014. The property market cooling measures undertaken by the government - including higher property gains tax and higher thresholds for foreign buyers - are also working. Developers grumble that a significant number of home buyers now fail the tighter guidelines. That should be taken as a good sign as far as cooling a potential asset bubble is concerned.\n\nFinally, the quality of household loans remains sound. Both the impaired loan ratio and loans in arrears continue to trend down. At the same time, total household assets over the last 10 years have also expanded, growing at an average annual 10.4 per cent to 322 per cent of GDP as at end 2013.\n\nSo why the doom and gloom? It could stem from the generally negative view of Malaysia among overseas analysts. Markets are also sceptical of Malaysia's resolve to tackle long-standing financial problems, including chronic budget deficits, growing national debt, waste and corruption. These issues will take a while - and lots of political will - to deal with. Meanwhile, concerns about Malaysia's household debt are overblown.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is 82.6 per cent higher than a month ago but 22.5 per cent lower than in March last year.\n\nMarket watchers note that the improved numbers suggest pent-up demand in March after the festive months of January and February. But they say it is too early to cheer as the latest data merely reflects a stabilising market since the cooling measures late last year.\n\nThe month-on-month increase in resale prices in March \"mustn't be read as significantly improved buyers' sentiments for resale homes, and neither can it be construed as possible turnaround in price performance and confirm price recovery for resale homes in 2014\", said Ong Kah Seng, director at R'ST Research. There is still an \"overall cautiousness lingering\", he added.\n\nResale prices in Core Central Region (CCR) and the RCR improved during March, climbing 0.3 per cent and 1.3 per cent respectively. But resale prices in Outside Central Region (OCR) continued to soften last month with a 0.1 per cent decline.\n\nERA Realty key executive officer Eugene Lim noted that OCR is most affected by new supply from more projects obtaining the temporary occupation permit (TOP). \"In addition, the slew of cooling measures collectively affects the typical purchaser of suburban properties as they may not be as financially mobile as higher-end purchasers.\"\n\nRental prices also came down last month even though rental volumes increased. An estimated 3,087 units were rented in March, 27.8 per cent more than in February, but rental prices came down by 0.9 per cent month on month.\n\nWhile rental price declines were observed islandwide, they were most pronounced in the RCR, where rental prices fell 1.4 per cent month on month.\n\nLeasing competition is expected to heat up as newly completed private homes are put up for rent, property consultants say. More than 17,000 private residential units are expected to be completed this year, which will be the highest number since the Urban Redevelopment Authority started keeping these records in 1996. This will also be 75 per cent higher than the long-term average in the last 18 years.\n\nMr Lim noted that there was still demand for rental but landlords have to be more realistic to compete for tenants. \"It is now a tenant's market and location is all the more important. Those properties that are near MRT are highly preferred due to convenience,\" he said. \"In addition, new apartments are preferred compared to older ones.\"\n\nSRX's new forward looking indicator - TOX or median transaction over X-value - ended at a negative $13,112 in March after fluctuating in the negative territory. This suggests that median transacted price was lower than the X-value, which is the estimated value of the unit based on past transacted prices.\n\nThere may be subsequent months where resale transactions include newly completed units that are smaller and have higher per-square-foot pricing.\n\nResales of such units may cause an \"ad hoc\" increase in the median resale prices, which is not sustainable, Mr Ong said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The global average net worth of superyacht owners is US$680 million, against US$520 million for private jet owners.\n\nThe challenge for the yachting industry, however, is that while nascent, South-east Asia's sea-faring market is still largely underdeveloped.\n\nOnly 7 per cent of luxury asset spending in the region went towards yachting last year; the global average is 16 per cent.\n\nMoreover, there is a high financial threshold for yacht purchases, which creates a challenge for the industry, given that the liquidity of South-east Asia's ultra-high net worth individuals is lower than the global average.\n\nFor instance, superyacht owners are predominantly self-made men in their 60s, with an average liquidity of US$117 million; their yacht holdings are worth at least US$20 million - US$8 million more than for aircraft owners.\n\nThe two-day Asia Pacific Yachting Conference 2014, which ends today, is being held in conjunction with the Singapore Yacht Show.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Following a proposal to re-allocate $5.2 million of proceeds from the FY2013 fund-raising, CCM will have $10.8 million available for investments in property development.\n\nCCM will be exploring property development opportunities in Western Australia, and plans to invest $5.5 million from the FY2013 fund-raising to buy a 55-hectare parcel of land in Houston, Texas through a 60 per cent-held US partnership.\n\nChan Heng Fai, a CCM executive director, and Hengfai Business Development (HBD), which Mr Chan fully controls, will give an irrevocable undertaking that they will subscribe for their full pro rata entitlement of 680.88 million rights issue shares and up to 39.12 million of excess rights shares, subject to availability.\n\nAs HBD will grant a loan of $3.6 million to CCM, Mr Chan intends to set off the loan against the amount he needs to pay to subscribe for the rights issue.

But DBS is not backing down and is confident of its risk management in the area of trade finance, said Tom McCabe, head of global transaction services at DBS.\n\nThe fastest growth for DBS's transaction banking is from China, and among the three homegrown banks, DBS has the highest exposure - its China-linked loans make up 35 per cent of its loan portfolio.\n\nThe fears over China, especially following its first-ever default on an onshore corporate bond, have to be measured against the large number of defaults in the US, and against the huge amount of trade flow into and out of China, he told The Business Times in an interview last week.\n\n\"One or two defaults is getting such huge headlines in China, but that's frankly part of a healthy business environment,\" said Mr McCabe.\n\nDBS has a trade-loan book of about $60 billion, and will boost it further on the back of the US$580 billion in Asian trade growth that is expected this year. \"For me to grow at 10 per cent . . . it is a drop in the bucket,\" said Mr McCabe, adding that such growth would not be reckless \"in any means\". By lifting margins this year, he could see \"mid-teens\" profit growth this year that does not involve taking on any new risks.\n\nSouth-east Asia's largest lender is focused on cherry-picking its clients, with about 60 per cent of its transaction services revenue of $1.5 billion last year - which grew 5 per cent over the year - from multinational clients. These include giant commodity houses and global oil companies expanding into Asia.\n\nWhen it comes to trade loans, DBS will only offer them to suppliers that are essential to a customer's operations. It also snaps up Chinese clients in growth industries such as the supply of automotive and medical tools, said Mr McCabe.\n\nCritically, DBS is committed to working only with the top four banks in China, and some second-tier mainland banks, he added. This is important, since trade finance via the issuance of letters of credit (LCs) is typically a bank-to-bank affair, with one bank representing the importer, and the other representing an exporter. The importer's bank pays the exporter's bank - usually out of an established credit facility - after verifying the relevant trade documents on behalf of their clients.\n\nDBS also bills itself as a strong player in the commodity financing space, which is widely regarded as riskier than plain-vanilla LCs. Banks such as DBS protect themselves by taking ownership of the commodity during the financing period, said Mr McCabe.\n\nThis allows them to sell the commodity in the event of a default, though banks have to hedge their position in the commodities, which are usually volatile in price. The average tenor of its trade assets is about four months, Mr McCabe added.\n\nDBS can command such clout with large global corporations and top-rated banks in China because of its strong balance sheet - reinforced by stricter rules put out by regulators than what are prescribed by the Basel III framework - he said.\n\nMr McCabe was blunt about the competition, saying that many banks do not have a strong capital base.\n\nThis does not mean that the heat is off. On the contrary, several Western banks are returning to trade finance that is short-term in nature, and does not eat up capital. The fees that come with such services make up a big part of the transaction banking business, and can offer a steady stream of income if managed well, unless long-term trade flow slows drastically. This contrasts with income linked mainly to movements in interest rates and the markets, which can be more lucrative, but is also lumpier.\n\nBehind closed doors, global banks that have trade finance traditions have wondered if newer entrants such as DBS have the expertise to handle complexities behind trade finance.\n\nBut DBS - at the leadership of CEO Piyush Gupta and head of institutional banking group Jeanette Wong - seized the space vacated by Western banks in 2010, and hired several experienced trade-finance bankers, noted Mr McCabe.\n\nHe was part of that aggressive hiring process, having joined DBS that year after 12 years at Standard Chartered Bank, where he was last the global head of product management for transaction banking.\n\nDBS is now third among all trade finance banks in Asia after HSBC and Citibank, with a market share of about 10 per cent, said an East & Partners report this year.\n\nWith greater competition on the horizon, DBS wants to snag more SME clients from the region, and a big part of that strategy will come from a working capital advisory programme. Announced last month, this will be used to benchmark a client against a database of over 50,000 companies, and according to Mr McCabe, is a service typically offered by consultancies.\n\nThe comparison will involve working on issues such as capital ratios and cash conversion cycles.\n\nDBS expects this to be most significant for SMEs with annual sales of over $20 million, which are not approached by large global banks since they \"don't have the time to talk to them\", said Mr McCabe. \"This will be an absolute game changer for us,\" he said. \"From a risk point of view, do (we) have to chase riskier deals? No we don't.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The final price will be equivalent to 1.15 times the 2014 book value of Noble's agricultural business. Based on Noble Agri's audited book value of US$2.8 billion for FY2013, the deal values it at US$3.22 billion.\n\nThe prospect of a deal with Cofco has fuelled Noble's share price by more than 20 per cent since the start of the year. Noble shares gained 10 per cent in the two days since the announcement was made, hitting S$1.32 a share. The last time Noble shares were trading around S$1.30 was back in October 2012. The US$1.5 billion deal came as a pleasant surprise for investors since the market valuation for the loss-making agribusiness was closer to US$700 million when Noble first contemplated a separate listing.\n\nHowever, as the initial euphoria begins to settle, Noble shareholders are left wondering if the company could hold out for more. They can't help but compare the deal to the 1.4 times seen in the tender offer made in March by Temasek Holdings, Singapore's investment group, for Olam - Noble's closest rival on the Singapore Exchange. Temasek has offered S$2.23 a share, valuing Olam at S$5.3 billion.\n\nBut apart from the fact that Noble and Olam share the same agricultural space, is it fair to compare the two deals?\n\nOn the one hand, defenders of the Noble-Cofco deal argue that the difference in valuation reflects the fact that Noble's agribusiness is loss-making, while Olam is profitable. The former contributed US$15.50 billion in revenue but lost hundreds of millions in 2013 for the group. In contrast, Olam made S$348.6 million in net profit excluding exceptional items and generated S$20.80 billion in revenue for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2013.\n\nOn the other hand, others have stressed that the intent of Cofco and Temasek is different.\n\nIn Olam's case, Temasek is merely a financial investor that already has a 24.6 per cent interest at the time of offer. It is buying Olam shares, presumably because it sees value in agricultural trading.\n\nIn Noble's case, state-owned Cofco has a larger agenda. It needs to ensure the security of China's overseas food supply. This is evident in its shopping cart, which includes its purchase of a 51 per cent stake in Nidera BV, a Dutch grains trader, for US$1.289 billion in February for better access to grain-growing regions such as Latin America and Russia. For US$1.5 billion, Cofco will be able to minimise its exposure to the global price volatility and source key commodities directly, eliminating intermediaries.\n\nSo arguably, given the importance of Noble's assets, which include a vast network of ports and commodity terminals, to Cofco, could Noble hold out for more?\n\nIt is hard to say. But what's clear is that for now, it seems Noble needs Cofco just as much as Cofco needs the former and the market has embraced this.\n\nWith Cofco taking a 51 per cent stake, Noble is not bailing out entirely of its agribusiness. Instead, via the new joint venture, it is able to cut its exposure to its loss-making operations while sharing in a potential recovery. With Cofco, Noble has secured a conduit to China, the world's biggest consumer market. As an analyst succinctly pointed out: Noble provides the pipeline and Cofco brings in the volume. Cofco will ensure the relevance of Noble's assets which include four sugar mills in Brazil, soyabean crushing plants in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, and grain silos in Ukraine, alongside a vast network of ports and commodity terminals.\n\nWith Cofco, Noble is roping in a partner with deep pockets to take over its smallest business division. The joint venture will take on the US$2.5 billion net debt of the agricultural business, significantly cutting Noble's debt which stood at US$4.9 billion end-2013. With a higher credit rating than Noble, Cofco as a partner can only be credit positive.\n\nThe fresh funds provide more flexibility for Noble to take its agribusiness, as well as energy and metals operations, to the next level, something the market seems to be waiting for with bated breath.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The MPA stepped up its vigilance over the industry and some bunker operators, their staff and quality and quantity surveyors were prosecuted and convicted. Some bunker operators had their licences suspended.\n\nAccording to an MPA technical officer, the current \"sounding\" method used across the industry involves the manual measuring of the depth of the tank to calculate its volume. Using basic mathematics, the mass of the tank is then calculated from this volume. This is where the problem comes in.\n\nThe \"sounding\" system allows room for human error in measurement, which in many cases has proven to be intentional. A mere error of a few centimetres in measuring the tank will result in different volume and mass figures of the tank and thus, the amount of fuel delivered and the cost to the shipowner.\n\nThe new MFM method removes the human intervention involved in the process as the mass flow meter will now automatedly measure the mass of the bunker, without calculating volume. This automated process will also allow the bunkering process to be more efficient and productive as less manpower is required.\n\nUsing the MFM system for bunker delivery allows ships to enjoy up to three hours or 25 per cent time savings per bunker delivery. With greater efficiency in bunkering operations, the bunker craft operators can optimise their turnaround times and bunker more vessels.\n\nAlthough the MFM process is not new as it has been used selectively in several ports, Singapore is the first to make it mandatory.\n\nFrom Jan 1, 2017, all bunker suppliers have to use the MFM system for bunker delivery of fuel oil in the Port of Singapore.\n\nExisting bunker tankers operating in port must be fitted with an MPA-approved MFM system by Dec 31, 2016.\n\nNew bunker tankers applying for harbour craft (bunker tanker) licence after Dec 31, 2014 will be required to be fitted with the system, the MPA said in a statement yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Of note is that what really matters is revenue/profit growth in addition to current valuation on an ongoing basis. For now, we maintain our constructive outlook for both the US and global economic growth this year. Notwithstanding the harsh US winter that has led to a temporary aberration in incoming data, the current economic situation remains supportive:\n\nArguably, now is a good time to still own equities, even for those who are currently under-invested. Nonetheless, there are always obstacles in the path of equity investors and right now these include Russian foreign policy, China's bad debt reckoning and, most significantly in our view, monetary normalisation.\n\nMonetary normalisation\n\nNothing goes up or down forever; understandably, investors have to deal with the eventual normalisation of current emergency level monetary policy settings. In the coming normalisation, it will likely force bond markets to more closely reflect the economic reality as we see it. In fact, Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen's first press conference this week certainly suggested that the US' central bankers are increasingly confident of the prospects for the US economy even if interest rates are still not expected to rise until next year.\n\nEven so, we expect the long end of the curve - probably more relevant for discounting long-term corporate cash flows - to further back up from current levels. In such an environment, equity markets should find the going much tougher as the present value of the corporate sector's future cash flows shrink correspondingly. However, the reverse yield gap (equity yield minus bond yield) between bonds and equities remains sufficiently large, in our opinion. Therefore, it could allow for both bonds to weaken significantly from here and equity investors to still enjoy attractive returns.\n\nGeopolitical risk\n\nWe cannot pretend any great insight into the likely evolution of the Russia/Ukraine crisis. Beyond the basic points to be made about trade links, gas pipelines, banking exposure and the like, the factors that will shape it are beyond the reach of armchair warriors and instant experts, and unpredictable even to seasoned local observers.\n\nWe do suspect, however, that the balance of probabilities favours eventual resolution. This assessment is based, we hope, on economic realism: self interest is a powerful motivator, and Russia and the West have far more to lose than gain from any escalation. Of course, in this centenary year we are mindful that awful multi-power blunders have been made in the past, and strategic ties may be looser today.\n\nChina's 'Bear Stearns' moment?\n\nThe first onshore default in Chinese publicly traded corporate debt has prompted some comparisons with the moment the Western world started to gaze more seriously into its own bad debt abyss back in 2007. However, let's bear in mind that no two situations are similar to the last detail. As such, we are doubtful that the first default is a harbinger of economic catastrophe to come. In fact, we see the default, and likely others to follow, as an encouraging sign that the Chinese authorities are starting to allow market forces to blow more meaningfully through the economy. We still see China avoiding economic catastrophe, though again there is of course room for policy misstep.\n\nIs it too late to buy?\n\nIf you very reasonably assume that analysts' consensus earnings forecasts are still too optimistic for this year, equity markets are actually even more highly rated than the headline forward price to earnings ratio would imply. So the S&P, for example, may already be trading on 16 or even 17x forecast earnings (versus the 10-year rolling average of closer to 15x).\n\nHowever, while economic growth is accelerating and monetary policy remains accommodative, changes in valuation from here, up or down, are unlikely to be the driving force behind returns.\n\nFrom current levels it is likely to be the combination of earnings growth available in a particular market and the dividend yield that will likely dominate. This suggests to us a return in the region of 5-10 per cent for US equity, while investors in Europe may expect a little more, given corporate earnings in much of the region still sits distant from previous peaks.\n\nInterestingly, in terms of proportional inflation adjusted basis, share prices tend to rise over time, in line with corporate profits, and there is no fixed limit for either.\n\nAt Barclays, clients are advised to invest in a global diversified portfolio with current higher preference for equity relative to fixed income, and only if their investment personalities permit.\n\nThe writer is chief investment officer, Asia and Middle East at Barclays\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": []}

This is estimated by its current owners to be worth more than US$3 billion.\n\nJES will be paying the vendors - two individuals called Yang Shushan and Yang Nan - up to US$65 million, to be paid in two stages.\n\nIt will first issue new JES shares amounting to either US$35 million or 20 per cent of JES' enlarged share capital for an initial 20 per cent stake in Scibois.\n\nAfter this is completed (targeted by May 31), the group can nominate and appoint directors to make up half of Scibois' board. It will also have the first right of option to manage Scibois' logistics and port businesses.\n\nIn the second stage, it will pay $30 million in cash for more Scibois shares to lift its stake to 51 per cent. This will be completed before July 15.\n\nAfter this, Scibois will provide a guarantee of achieving at least US$170 million in accumulated net profits before tax in the four years after the acquisition.\n\nIf this is not met, the vendors will compensate JES either by cash or dividend to ensure that JES' total investment is proportional to the accumulated net profits before tax of Scibois.\n\nScibois will also seek a listing on a stock exchange within four years, with a minimum market capitalisation of US$450 million.\n\n\"The group believes that this acquisition is an excellent opportunity to diversify our cyclical shipbuilding business,\" said JES CEO Jin Xin.\n\n\"The target already has a forest harvesting licence for a sizeable forest area. With fresh funding, the operations can be scaled up significantly to realise the full potential of this venture.\"\n\nJES will be helping Scibois in financing management, strategic execution and business modelling to enable it to become a global enterprise, it said in the announcement. Scibois will compensate JES for these management resources.\n\nJES said it plans to tap debt capital markets to raise a \"significant amount of funds\" in order to develop both its shipbuilding and forestry businesses, and will use the forestry asset as collateral for such debt issuance.\n\nIn the meantime, with the forestry acquisition providing both diversification benefits and synergies through managing Scibois' logistics and port businesses, JES said it is putting on hold its investment into Mineriver until further notice.\n\nBoth firms are now in negotiation to enter into a mutual deed of release to discharge the earlier investment agreement.\n\nJES had announced last November a plan to invest $127 million to buy up to 30 per cent of Mineriver, which holds exploration rights to a magnesium mine in northern Xinjiang.\n\nWhen Mineriver said in January that it was estimated to be sitting on more than US$500 million worth of resources, JES' shares shot up to a high of 20 cents.\n\nBut they have since been declining gradually, tumbling 33.6 per cent to 8.7 cents on Monday after JES' auditor expressed uncertainty about its ability to remain a going concern.\n\nThe counter was placed on a trading halt yesterday morning.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The meeting came after the March 14 declaration by the US Department of Commerce that NTIA (National Telecommunications and Information Administration) will transfer responsibility for key Internet domain name functions to ICANN.\n\nThis move has resulted in a storm of protests in the US. In just four days, more than 113,000 people signed a petition by the American Centre for Law and Justice opposing the plan \"to give away the Internet\". There are also at least two legislative proposals against the move doing the rounds in Washington. The big fear being expressed is that if the US were to let go, control of the Internet would fall into the hands of authoritarian governments who would not favour a free Internet.\n\nSuch fears are overblown. As a recent letter from a coalition of technology advocacy groups to top Republicans and Democrats on the House Commerce Committee, notes: \"This move (passing control from NTIA to ICANN) could help thwart government overreach in Internet governance, which would have devastating implications for human rights worldwide.\"\n\nNTIA's stewardship of Internet's address book, known as DNS (domain name system) is, for historical reasons, related to how the Internet developed in the US. The Internet today has outgrown its US origins. It is the backbone of global economic activity and is used by hundreds of millions. The vast majority of these users reside outside of the US. In fact, half of all Internet users today are in the Asia-Pacific region. And yet the region has little or no say in how the Internet is governed. As noted in the advocacy group's letter, NTIA's stewardship of the Internet has drawn criticism and growing opposition from the international community for the simple fact that a single government - the US - is overseeing what is a global resource.\n\nThis is not to say that the concerns voiced have no merit. Over the past few months, there have been several instances of governments blocking Internet sites such as Twitter and Facebook. In China, several social sites are permanently blocked. However, the response to this should not be to vest perpetual control in the hands of the US government. Rather, it should be to ensure that a sufficiently robust global multistakeholder governance framework is formed so that no single government or institution can exercise undue control.\n\nThe upcoming Net Mundial meeting in Sao Paulo on April 23-24 will bring together a wide range of experts from around the world to propose the roadmap for the evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem. The US can play a powerful leadership role at this meeting to set the direction. This, more than a pull-back of the decision to relinquish control, will help to keep the Internet free and vibrant.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This values the company at about $4.2 million.\n\nGems shares last traded at 0.3 cent on March 27 before being suspended.\n\nThe exit offer is unconditional. Mr Choo, who already has a 22.35 per cent stake in hand, has no immediate plans for Gems, but will conduct a comprehensive review of the company upon obtaining a controlling interest, Gems stated.\n\nGems has no operating business now, and has been on notice by the Singapore Exchange (SGX) since 2011. SGX places mainboard-listed companies on a watch-list if they miss minimum profitability and market-capitalisation requirements.\n\nAsian Corporate Advisors has been appointed the independent financial adviser for the independent directors.\n\nMr Choo's offer comes just over a month after a planned reverse takeover deal with commodities-trading subsidiary of Delhi-based REI Agro fell through over due-diligence concerns.\n\nOn Feb 28, Gems called off the deal after finding out that the majority of the vendor's business appeared to involve related parties, a fact which it said had not been previously disclosed by the vendor. This scuttled a potential transaction valued at $571.4 million and Gems' sole hope of getting off the SGX watch-list.\n\nLast November, when Gems initially announced the reverse takeover deal, Mr Choo had wanted to buy over its existing businesses for an indicative price of US$4.58 million.\n\nThe pending delisting would have marked the end of almost a decade for Gems as a listed company.\n\nGems had a sparkling start on the exchange in 2006, when it flaunted key pre-listing investors such as The Hour Glass, which held a 5 per cent stake ahead of the initial public offering (IPO). With an IPO price of $1.08 per share, Gems was valued at more than $1 billion at listing. The stock made a positive debut, climbing 11.1 per cent on its first day of trading.\n\nBut it did not take long for Gems to begin disappointing investors. In May 2007, it startled the market when it reported an 88 per cent drop in its fiscal third-quarter earnings. At that time, a number of analysts were still ready to give the company the benefit of the doubt, accepting Gems' view that its problems at the time were only short to medium-term ones.\n\nBut the company then ran into losses for four straight years from fiscal 2008 to 2011.\n\nGems last posted a net loss of US$2.3 million for the fiscal third quarter ended March. Its cash position stood at US$0.98 million as at end-March.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The latter owns a licence to harvest 229,400 hectares of forest area in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nJES will pay the current owners - father-and-son pair Yang Shushan and Yang Nan - up to US$65 million in two stages.\n\nIn November, JES had announced that it would invest $127 million to buy up to 30 per cent of Mineriver, which holds exploration rights to a magnesium mine in northern Xinjiang. But this will now be put on hold, with a view to termination.\n\nCompared to Mineriver, which only has exploration rights, Scibois has concession rights and is already operational, said Mr Kan.\n\n\"Given our position right now, it's much more advantageous for us to invest in a business to make money straight away.\"\n\nScibois' profits, which are currently \"not big\" due to the small scale of its operations, could be contributing to JES' bottom line as soon as this year, he added.\n\nJES is in dire financial straits, with its losses widening to 552.2 million yuan (S$111.3 million) in the 2013 financial year, from 112.3 million yuan in 2012. Its current liabilities have overwhelmed current assets, implying that it could face problems meeting its short-term obligations.\n\nThe Mineriver investment, and now the Scibois announcement, are attempts by the firm to diversify into a new stream of income.\n\nSo as to enable Scibois to scale up its business, JES will be stepping in to build barges to bring its logs down a river to the capital city of Kinshasa, where it is then transported by road to the sea port.\n\n\"By our participation in transporting (the logs) through the river, they will cut down the costs a lot,\" said Mr Kan.\n\nBesides the complementary nature of both businesses, Scibois has agreed to give JES management control by allowing it to appoint directors to make up half of the former's board. It has also agreed to provide a guarantee of achieving at least US$170 million in accumulated net profits before tax in the four years after the acquisition.\n\nIn comparison, JES was not allowed to participate in Mineriver's management, and was also not able to provide any profit guarantee.\n\n\"With the risk exposure, I feel much more comfortable with Scibois because we are allowed to participate in the management,\" said Mr Kan.\n\nBut even while the market expressed its approval towards the acquisition with the counter ending 1.2 cents higher at 9.9 cents yesterday, there was scepticism in some quarters.\n\n\"We highlight ... the stark disparity between Scibois' share capital of 100 million Congolese francs (US$110,000) against JES' purchase price of US$65 million,\" said Maybank Kim Eng analyst Bobby Lu. Scibois' forestry asset is estimated to be worth more than US$3 billion.\n\nIn response to doubts over whether this new investment will go the same way as Mineriver, Mr Kan said: \"We will try to close this deal as soon as possible, so as to validate what we have said in our announcement.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Although we are far short of a full recovery, normalisation of monetary policy - both conventional and unconventional - is now on the agenda.\"\n\nRecovery is \"strongest in the United States, where growth is forecast to be 2.8 per cent in 2014\", Mr Blanchard noted.\n\n\"It is also strong in the UK and Germany, where some imbalances persist, but where we forecast growth to be 2.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively.\"\n\nThe IMF cautioned, however, that in Japan, where it is forecasting 1.4 per cent growth in 2014, \"fiscal stimulus has played a large role, and the strength of the recovery depends on private demand taking over the relay\".\n\nIn the euro area, \"the good news is that, for the first time in two years, Southern periphery countries are forecast to have positive, if admittedly still low, growth\", noted Mr Blanchard.\n\nBut, while euro area exports are generally strong, \"internal demand is still weak, and it has to become stronger for the recovery to be sustained\", he said.\n\n\"Emerging and developing economies continue to have strong growth, lower than before the crisis, but high nevertheless,\" the IMF officials said.\n\n\"We forecast their growth to reach 4.9 per cent this year, slightly up from 4.7 per cent last year. In particular, we forecast growth of 7.5 per cent for China, and 5.4 per cent for India.\"\n\nEmerging and developing economies \"have to operate however in a changing world environment\", Mr Blanchard suggested.\n\n\"Stronger growth in advanced economies implies increased demand for their exports. The normalisation of monetary policy in the United States, however, implies tighter financial conditions and a tougher financial environment.\n\n\"Foreign investors are less forgiving, macroeconomic weaknesses are more costly. And financial bumps, such as those we saw last summer and earlier this year, may well happen again.\"\n\nThe IMF flagged a number of concerns despite the overall upbeat tone of the WEO, saying that while risks have diminished they have not disappeared.\n\n\"Adjustment and recovery in southern euro countries cannot be taken for granted, especially if euro area wide inflation remains very low or even, worse, turns to deflation, making the task of re-establishing competitiveness in the South even harder.\"\n\nMeanwhile, \"financial reform is incomplete, and the financial system remains at risk. Geopolitical risks have arisen, although they have not yet had global macroeconomic repercussions\".\n\nThe WEO also flagged longer-term risks, warning that \"potential growth in many advanced economies is very low\" and that reform of labour markets allied with increased productivity and increased competition is essential to sustain growth.\n\nThe report also drew attention to rising inequality in advanced and emerging economies as a potential threat to continuing economic growth and to social stability. This echoed a similar warning sounded last week by the Asian Development Bank.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The honour is not only for his distinctive homes across Japan and a branch of the Pompidou in Metz, France, but also for disaster housing utilising unusual materials such as cardboard tubes and shipping containers.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Property\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nCapitaLand\u2019s LyndenWoods sells 94% of units on launch day at average S$2,450 psf\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit IPO on Jul 14 broadens AI-related opportunities on SGX\n\n3\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\n4\n\nSingapore GDP up 4.3% in Q2: flash data\n\n5\n\nUS tariffs put spotlight on industrial S-Reits\u2019 upcoming H1 earnings", "images": []}

He said he's confident the rest will be snapped up.\n\nTenants at the tower include financial companies such as HSBC Holdings and DBS Group Holdings, according to Mr Wong, head of asset management at HKI China Land Ltd, which built the tower known as FFC.\n\n\"It's such a good time,\" Mr Wong said in an interview. \"The companies in Beijing still have the urge to expand, the financial sector that we focus on remains healthy, and we face relatively small competition because supply is limited. We have the conditions to choose the clients we want.\"\n\nRising demand and limited supply have doubled office rents in the Chinese capital since 2008, making its Finance Street the world's third-most expensive behind Hong Kong's Central and London's West End, according to real estate broker CBRE Group Inc. The cost of renting offices in Beijing is set to rise further as only half the average annual supply over the past decade is projected to be added in the next three years. Office rents in the city will rise 3 per cent to 5 per cent in the next two years, CBRE's Frank Chen estimates.\n\n\"Beijing has more upside potential than Shanghai, particularly for the next two to three years,\" said Mr Chen, a Shanghai-based executive director at CBRE Research. \"The rents are much higher, but they're just not falling back because supply is so scarce.\"\n\nOnly one project of 50,000 square metres near Beijing's central business district is anticipated in the next six months compared with 3 million sq m of new space in Shanghai this year and next, said CBRE. New office space in Beijing is set to average 270,000 sq m between 2013 and 2015, the broker said.\n\nNew supply in the capital, which spreads across six concentric ring roads, hit a peak of 1.25 million sq m in 2008. The construction boom was due to developers rushing to finish projects ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.\n\nDevelopment has been slow to restart while much of the new space has been taken by state-owned enterprises. Between 2009 and 2012, 2.2 million sq m of grade-A offices were completed with only half that amount for lease in the private market, according to an August report by broker Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.\n\nCorporations have rented an average 590,000 sq m a year in Beijing since the Olympics, more than double the 240,000 sq m of new workspace added in the period, according to CBRE. That pushed rents to 413 yuan (S$83) a sq m per month in the quarter ended Dec 31, compared with 250 yuan in Shanghai, said CBRE.\n\nBeijing doesn't have a lot of spare commercial land in the city centre for buildings and many projects were completed in the lead up to the Olympics, CBRE's Mr Chen said.\n\nClosely held HKI China's FFC project provided the first new office space in Beijing's CBD in seven quarters, boosting the vacancy rate to 3.9 per cent at the end of last year. That was up from a record low 2.3 per cent in the second quarter of 2013, according to CBRE.\n\nThe vacancy rate for grade-A offices hit a historic high of nearly 30 per cent in 2009, said Jones Lang LaSalle.\n\nThe capital's CBD is on the Third Ring Road to the east of the Forbidden City, the 15th-Century former imperial palace in the heart of Beijing.\n\nFinance Street, where global investment banks and the nation's central bank and financial regulators are located, is a 1.2-sq-km zone along Beijing's Second Ring Road to the west of the historic centre. The vacancy rate on Finance Street was just 0.1 per cent last quarter with the average rent topping 500 yuan a sq m. That compares to 470 yuan in the CBD, where the FFC is located, said CBRE. Vacancies stood at 3.4 per cent in London's West End and 4.5 per cent in Hong Kong's Central.\n\nBeijing's overall grade-A office vacancy rate is expected to remain at around 5 per cent due to limited new supply, Zhang Jingjing, associate director and head of research at Knight Frank LLP, said in a report. The probability of a significant drop in rents is slim with only slight adjustments likely in the second quarter, he said.\n\nClose proximity to the central government and regulatory agencies makes Beijing a \"strategic choice\", with 48 of the 89 Chinese companies on the Global Fortune 500 list basing their headquarters in the city, said Jones Lang LaSalle. Of 500 Chinese and foreign companies on the list, at least 123 chose Beijing for their China head office, the realtor said.\n\n\"Some sectors need to be physically closer to regulators,\" said CBRE's Chen. Among the new tenants at FFC is DBS, South-east Asia's biggest bank, which will move its private-banking operations to a larger area in the new building from Winland International Finance Center at the north end of Finance Street. The landlord of the Singapore-based bank's current office has already secured a new tenant.\n\nA Chinese fund management company will take half of the 2,400 sq m vacated by DBS, said Kevin Lam, assistant marketing director at Beijing Winland Real Estate. \"The price is more than twice what DBS paid\" when it renewed its contract in 2011, he said. Winland is among the most expensive office buildings in Beijing and charges an average of about 750 yuan a sq m per month for new clients excluding property management fees. That is about triple the rent of 250 yuan in 2005 when the building started leasing, Mr Lam said.\n\nThe 100,000-sq-m Winland is home to more than 50 companies, 46 of which are international financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc and UBS AG, he said.\n\nFor property investors, Beijing is the most favoured location for office acquisitions out of 15 major Chinese cities, topping CBRE's MarketScore list issued Jan 13. The city, followed by the financial centre of Shanghai, enjoys low risk and stable expected returns, and stands out in indicators including historical rental growth, vacancy and future development pipelines, CBRE said.\n\nWhile investment demand is strong, supply of properties for sale is limited. In the five years through 2012, only 61 sales of office buildings and business parks worth at least US$5 million were recorded in Beijing, compared with 107 transactions in Shanghai, Jones Lang LaSalle said in an August report.\n\nHKI China, a unit of Hong Kong-based HKI Group that develops office buildings and villas in Chinese cities, has capped the proportion of FFC leased to core clients that typically take larger amounts of space at lower rents to about 35 per cent of the total and will focus on industry leaders that can add value to the building, Mr Wong said.\n\nBeijing, which targets 7.5 per cent growth this year, is expected to become the world's fifth-largest city economy in 2025 after Tokyo, New York, Shanghai and Los Angeles, jumping from the 26th in 2010, according to Jones Lang LaSalle. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

Once the sale of the first 285 units is complete, the plan is to assess market conditions with a view to raising prices for the remaining 260 lots.\n\nCCM said it expected the infrastructure development of the 285 lots to be completed by the last quarter of 2014.\n\n\"The overwhelming pre-sale interest for more than half the total number of plots underscores the appeal of the project in Houston, where there is job and economic recovery from growth of the energy sector,\" said the company's chairman and chief executive, Joseph Liew.\n\n\"We will continue to explore opportunities to build upon CCM's strategic diversification to US property to enhance shareholder value,\" he added.\n\nLast month, CCM subsidiary CCM Perth lodged formal offers for land sites in Perth worth a total of A$2.18 million (S$2.55 million). These sites are to be developed into luxury apartments and townhouses for sale to Australian citizens and foreign investors.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It wasn't just that China's economy appeared to be slowing even more than was previously thought. Starting in late February - when pro-Russian forces began taking control of the Crimean peninsula, leading to Moscow's annexation of that part of Ukraine - Russian stocks lost as much as a fifth of their value, and the group ended the quarter down roughly 14 per cent. Now there are growing concerns that Western sanctions and rising borrowing costs could push Russia into a recession.\n\n\"You have the whole Russian situation unnerving investors,\" said Todd McClone, co-manager of the William Blair Emerging Markets Growth fund.\n\nYet Mr McClone and other global money managers advise investors not to panic. Russian stocks represent only about 5 per cent of the total holdings of a typical emerging-market fund. And many money managers doubt that Russia's move against Ukraine will ultimately be viewed as an emerging-market crisis.\n\n\"This has been characterised as an emerging-market problem, but this is really a developed-world issue,\" said Simon Hallett, chief investment officer at Harding Loevner, which invests globally. He says Brazil and India, for example, aren't directly affected by the crisis in Ukraine. \"On the other hand,\" he said, \"it has a lot of implications for Germany and France and the US,\" the nations that are threatening sanctions on Russia and that could face economic retaliation.\n\nSome investors, in fact, wonder if the negative headlines coming out of Russia could be the cathartic events needed to lead contrarian investors back to emerging markets. It's too soon to tell. But bargain-minded investors are slowly making their way back in guarded ways.\n\nConsider John C Maxwell, manager of the Ivy International Core Equity fund, which has beaten more than 80 per cent of its peers over the one and five years through March.\n\nMr Maxwell's fund is allowed to hold as much as 15 per cent of its assets directly in emerging-market shares. Last year, when the US Federal Reserve began discussing plans to taper its stimulus efforts, the fund's developing-world stake fell to a five-year low of about 6 per cent. But after the Fed discussion set off a decline in emerging-markets shares, Mr Maxwell built his developing-market stake back up to around 13 per cent.\n\nPart of the allure is valuations, he said. At the end of the first quarter, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index traded at a price-to-earnings ratio of around 10, lower than the historical average of around 14. And compared with global stocks in general, emerging-market shares are cheaper today than they were during the financial crisis, when investors fled many speculative assets. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": []}

He added that the scheme opens avenues for companies to grow with ideas and expand, not just locally, but overseas as well.\n\nSenior Minister of State for Education and Law Indranee Rajah, who announced the initiative, said: \"There is a growing trend of businesses being valued based on intangible assets.\"\n\nShe cited a report showing 42 per cent of enterprise value in Singapore being intangible assets in 2012, against 35 per cent in 2011. \"With IPOS's new IP Financing Scheme, businesses can monetise their IP assets,\" Ms Rajah said.\n\nThe $100 million for the scheme, set aside by the government to co-share the risk, will kick in only if a company defaults.\n\n\"It's a safety net and also a catalyst,\" Mr Tan said, referring to the money. \"We hope to be able to catalyse and encourage the bank to go further to finance the IP-rich companies so that they can also help to grow a lot more like Apple, Samsung and Google, as they expand overseas.\"\n\nThree banks - DBS, OCBC and UOB - are currently taking part in the scheme, with potentially more to follow.\n\nSaid Lim Chu Chong, head of SME banking at DBS: \"Definitely having IP as collateral will make the risk slightly lower, and therefore it will lead to slightly lower interest rates.\"\n\nHe said that DBS plans to offer packages with interest rates in the range of 3.5-7.5 per cent, in both SGD and USD. The tenor of such loans will be between one and six years.\n\nEric Tham, managing director and head of Group Commercial Banking at UOB, said the scheme would facilitate banks in supporting knowledge-based, asset-light companies.\n\nBut he added that certain IPs also have a limited lifespan. \"I would expect that it will be shorter-term tenors, perhaps not more than three years.\"\n\nLinus Goh, head of Global Commercial Banking at OCBC, said the scheme allows the bank to look at IP as a new asset class, and think of it as a basis for financing.\n\n\"If you look at it today, we support many small businesses. We finance them on an unsecured basis at the start of their businesses,\" he said. \"Many of these businesses may, in fact, have IP within their business strategy. So if we are able to isolate that, it becomes another positive consideration for us to look at mitigating risks.\"\n\nThe banks will start accepting applications from late Q2 this year, with the scheme available till April 2016.\n\nInterested companies have to obtain an IP valuation report from an appointed IP valuer. There are currently three approved valuation companies - American Appraisal Singapore, Consor Intellectual Asset Management and Deloitte & Touche Financial Advisory Services.\n\nThe launch of the IP Financing Scheme, at Manulife Centre, was held in conjunction with the official opening of IPOS's new IP service centre, IP 101, there.\n\nLocated at Bras Basah Road, the centre will offer access to a suite of IP products and services, including filing and registration of IP, as well as providing assistance to build companies' IP management capability. IPOS will also roll out complimentary IP-related business and legal clinics at the new premises.\n\n\"IP 101 is designed as the one-stop centre for all IP-related queries,\" said Mr Tan. \"It's the single point of contact that we have physically with the IP companies.\"\n\nAlso unveiled yesterday was a new IPOS campaign, \"Embracing IP\", couched to bring IP closer to innovators, creators and businesses.\n\nSaid Ms Rajah: \"I'm confident that Singapore will increasingly embrace IP as we build a better future with ideas and innovation.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Officials are already preparing alternatives for other cities. \"Other airports have not said anything yet, but they will probably have to come up with contingencies,\" said Carlos Ozores, a principal at aviation consultancy ICF International that has consulted for Brazilian airlines and airport operators.\n\nConcern over Brazil's airports is especially acute since they represent some of the tournament's most lasting investments. A host of other transportation projects have been scrapped or postponed, adding to criticism that the World Cup will leave few long-term benefits for ordinary Brazilians.\n\nQuick fixes and last-minute deliveries are a recipe for chaos in the complex aviation industry, analysts say. Bungled openings of terminals from London to Denver took months to straighten out.\n\nThe stakes will be high in Brazil as more than 600,000 visitors arrive for the World Cup starting in June, one of the biggest sudden influxes the country has ever seen.\n\n\"People coming to Brazil are going to be shocked, especially Americans, by the how bad the airports are,\" said Paul Irvine, who runs travel agency Dehouche in Rio de Janeiro. \"There won't be any catastrophic issues . . . but they will be chaotic and ugly as heck,\" he said.\n\nAny air travel chaos could be especially embarrassing for President Dilma Rousseff, who made a bold political bet by privatising a handful of key airports to ready them for the tournament, accelerating work that had languished under state control. The move broke with the ideology of her leftist Workers' Party.\n\nIf those airports fail to deliver the smooth service that helped to justify the privatisations, it could quickly become an election campaign issue as she seeks a second term in October. The airport concessions are a closely watched first step in her more than US$100 billion plan to draw private investment to public infrastructure projects.\n\nConstruction delays at publicly administered airports have been far more dramatic. At the start of last month, airport overhauls in seven World Cup host cities were only half finished or worse, according to Infraero, the government agency that oversees airport operations.\n\nStill, the privately run projects are drawing scrutiny. Civil aviation authority Anac has redoubled its inspections of three privatised airports since learning at the start of this year that work was behind proposed timelines.\n\nOne new terminal is set to open in weeks and the private operator promises another by next month, although municipal authorities are downplaying that possibility.\n\nAt Guarulhos Airport outside of Sao Paulo, Brazil's biggest city, the glistening facade of the new Terminal 3 hides an interior still missing several walls, ceilings and basic operating systems. \"Guarulhos is where we expect to get the most blowback,\" said one government official briefed on the airport's progress, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nThe automated baggage check and immigrations systems originally promised will not be ready for the World Cup. The new international terminal is set to open at a fraction of its eventual capacity, handling just one in four foreign flights - less than 10 per cent of overall traffic at the airport.\n\n\"At Terminal 3 in Guarulhos, they have already shifted from more airlines to fewer for the World Cup, and one could imagine further announcements ahead,\" said Mr Ozores. \"There's clearly a correction going on, an adjustment of expectations.\"\n\nBy most accounts, construction at the privatised airports has moved at a relentless pace, with as many as 8,000 workers on shifts around the clock at each site. Operators say that they will deliver new terminals by the deadlines they promised.\n\nBut the timelines for the airports were tight from the start. After winning auctions in February 2012, paperwork and regulations held up construction until the second half of the year, leaving airports with as little as a year and a half for their overhauls.\n\nViracopos, another privatised airport outside of Sao Paulo where several national teams will be chartering flights, was 82 per cent finished with its promised expansion in January, about three months before its deadline.\n\nBy contrast, several World Cup stadiums were finished late, but organisers have now held test matches in all except one of 12 scheduled to host games: Sao Paulo's Arena Corinthians, where the deaths of three construction workers have slowed work amid investigations.\n\nBrazil's need for new airport terminals is unmistakable, with three in four airports stretched beyond intended capacity since 2010 after air traffic more than doubled in a decade, according to Infraero.\n\nHowever, the scramble to finish construction on the eve of the World Cup has created the potential for snags in a system with little margin for error.\n\nThe Brazilian Air Force has further complicated things by declaring no-fly zones over stadiums during matches for security reasons, disrupting flights in several cities for as much as five hours at a time. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The top bid at yesterday's tender of nearly $634 million, or $906.29 per square foot of potential gross floor area, was just 2.1 per cent more than the next highest bid of $887.42 psf per plot ratio (psf ppr) from CapitaLand units Mahogany One and Mahogany Two.\n\nHowever, the top bid was 17.6 per cent above the third highest bid of $770.49 psf ppr from a City Developments-Hong Leong Holdings tie-up and double the lowest bid of $440.28 psf ppr. The latter came from Sim Lian, which recently launched its Vision Exchange project in Jurong East where office units were recently sold at an average price of $2,150 psf.\n\nBased on Far East-Sekisui's top bid, market watchers estimated its breakeven cost at about $1,800 psf.\n\nYesterday's tender attracted eight bids.\n\nJones Lang LaSalle national director Ong Teck Hui noted that the highest bid was about 10 per cent below the $1,009 psf ppr that Sim Lian paid for its Vision Exchange site in December 2012.\n\nBoth sites have 99-year leasehold tenure.\n\nThe lower bid yesterday is \"reflective of the site's location in Woodlands, a relatively untested market for offices\", said Mr Ong.\n\nAgreeing, a market watcher said Jurong East is more advanced in terms of its development as a commercial hub compared with Woodlands. Another reason for the lower price for the Woodlands site is that it comes with more conditions. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has stipulated that at least 90 per cent, or 629,602 sq ft, of the 699,557 sq ft maximum gross floor area (GFA) for the site must be for offices - in line with the plan for Woodlands Regional Centre to be developed as a major employment centre in Singapore's northern area.\n\nA further minimum 5,382 sq ft must be set aside for childcare centre use. The rest of the GFA can be for additional office or other complementary commercial uses such as retail, food and beverage and/or entertainment. Residential use is not allowed.\n\nWhile strata subdivision is allowed for the office component, all the non-office uses (including the childcare centre) have to be held under a single strata lot and owned by a single entity.\n\nProperty consultants polled by BT when the site was launched last December generally predicted five to eight bids for the site, though they differed widely on their expectations of the top bid - from $500 psf ppr to $1,100 psf ppr.\n\nChia Siew Chuin, director at Colliers International, described the eight bids garnered as a \"strong participation rate\" signalling developers' optimism about the growth story for Woodlands Regional Centre. \"Being the first site predominantly for office use in Woodlands, the site is expected to serve as the catalyst to kick-start the development of the Woodlands Regional Centre after all these years since decentralised regional centres were first conceptualised in 1991.\"\n\nThe site is a stone's throw from the interchange at Woodlands MRT Station, where the existing North- South line will meet the future Thomson line.\n\nMoreover, says Far East Organization executive director (property services) Chng Kiong Huat, Woodlands will be linked to Johor Baru via a rapid transit link system in 2018.\n\nUnder the proposed scheme, the Far East-Sekisui project will have one basement level - for car parking and retail space and provide direct connectivity to the MRT station and Causeway Point.\n\nLevel 1 will also have some retail space in addition to the office lobby. Level 2 will feature green open space, a childcare centre and a link-bridge between the two towers. Offices will fill Levels 3 to 16.\n\nThe strata office units are likely to be launched for sale towards the year-end or early next year.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Anecdotal evidence suggests that this trend has continued. According to the latest Shipping Confidence Survey from international accountant and shipping adviser Moore Stephens, freight rates are likely to improve or be maintained at existing levels over the next 12 months, while an increase in private equity funding is expected to have a major impact on the industry.\n\nThe firm says that the average confidence level expressed by respondents in the markets in which they operate was 6.5 on a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high), compared to the 6.1 recorded in the previous survey in November 2013. This was the highest figure since the 6.8 registered when the survey was launched in May 2008.\n\nSurveys such as these should be taken with a pinch of salt but optimism was very evident at the recent Asia Pacific Maritime event, though you could find some contrasting views there. For example, offshore support vessel owners were significantly more upbeat than those struggling to make a profit in the container trades.\n\nNevertheless, Moore Stephens says that the rise in confidence was reflected by all categories of respondents to the survey. Confidence on the part of owners edged up to 6.6 from 6.2, while the rating for charterers (up from 5.7 to 6.5) was the highest in the life of the survey. The rating for managers was up from 6.1 to 6.4, while that for brokers rose to 6.4 from 5.6. Geographically, confidence was up in Asia (from 5.9 to 6.4), in Europe (from 6.1 to 6.4), and in North America (from 6.6 to 7.1).\n\nComments made during the survey tend to show a bit more caution than the figures themselves indicate. Moore Stephens notes that the mood of improving confidence was tempered by an awareness of the difficulties which the industry still faces.\n\nA typical comment went along the lines of: \"There are signs that we have passed the deepest point of the recession. The only question now is how long it will take for the markets to improve to the point where we have sustainable rates again. It may be that some shipowners will still not make it because time - or cash and the patience of the banks - will run out.\"\n\nWhile there is talk of newbuildings causing over-tonnaging, several industry insiders say the situation is improving. One said: \"The markets have been in the low-end band for the past five years, affected by both supply-side and demand-side crises. But the supply side is now showing some stability, and the demand forecasts are positive in the light of various recovery measures underway in certain major economies. We expect to see the supply/demand imbalance corrected in the fourth quarter of 2014. Then rates will rise, and it will be payback time!\"\n\nAnother comment was that the supply/demand imbalance should start to improve over the next 12 months as more \"dirty and inefficient\" ships are scrapped. In the same vein, one owner was confident \"because we invested heavily in eco-ships, which will be the best performers in the coming years\".\n\nWell, we will see. Some less hopeful views were expressed, including \"there is no doubt that we are living on borrowed money and borrowed time, and the hot-air bubble is about to give; we are enjoying a false sense of security\".\n\nAmong the factors tempering optimism was the rising cost of fuel. One respondent complained: \"Fuel prices are a deterrent. Freight rates have increased, but fuel prices eat into time-charter equivalents.\"\n\nSurprisingly, there was a major factor affecting the industry that received scant attention by shipowners and operators. According to Moore Stephens, one issue that was largely noticeable by its absence from the comments of the survey respondents was the cost of impending regulation. The firm says: \"This may be because the cost of complying with the likes of the Ballast Water Management (BWM) Convention and the proposed new regulations governing emissions control are as yet unquantifiable. This, however, has not stopped people from quantifying them, with one leading shipowner recently estimating that it will cost the industry US$80 billion to achieve BWM compliance.\"\n\nBut emissions regulations will be the first crunch point. More and more shipowners operating in Emission Control Areas are taking action to meet the impending 0.1 per cent sulphur rule by fitting scrubbers while a few are moving to LNG as fuel. The majority of owners, however, will find that from next year they or their charters will face greatly increased fuel bills.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what happens to confidence in a year's time.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So conventional wisdom is that it is almost impossible to find massive outperformers here, or \"ten-baggers\", as brokers like to call those that are the holy grail of investing.\n\nMaybe so. For some investors, Singapore might not be as exciting as other markets, but as the saying goes, \"look and ye shall find\". There are actually many \"ten-baggers\" available if one looks hard enough.\n\nToday, we present three of the local market's most stunning performers in recent times - one that has managed to more than quadruple in about 10 weeks since listing with no analyst coverage; another which has risen 30 times in five years with only three local houses covering it; and a third, whose gain of over 25 times, also over five years, has come with plenty of analyst coverage.\n\nThe first is medical oncology group Talkmed Group, which listed on Catalist at the end of January and offered 105.1 million shares all via placement at 20 cents each. Those shares now trade for 95 cents - an astounding 375 per cent gain in about nine weeks, making it possibly the best performing initial public offering in the history of the local market.\n\nAlso, Talkmed's first-day performance on Jan 31 was perhaps the most impressive we've ever seen - it closed at 82 cents, a 310 per cent debut premium. (Clearly, the book-building process the company referred to in its announcement under the Plan of Distribution section to determine a suitable offer price didn't really yield useful market intelligence, but that's a separate discussion).\n\nThe stock did dip to 68 cents a few days later, and then on Feb 11 jumped to 85 cents, a gain of almost 20 per cent in one day that drew a query from the Singapore Exchange. After replying that it did not know of reasons for the rise, the stock has headed north since.\n\nTalkmed is profitable - for the year ended Dec 31, 2013, it reported $28.2 million in after-tax profit, which gives it a historic earnings per share of 4.3 cents, or a price-earnings multiple of 22. Unfortunately, there is no analyst coverage, according to Bloomberg, so forecasts are not available.\n\nAn earnings multiple of 22 might be considered rich by some; on the other hand, the demand for good quality medical services cannot be underestimated. With such outperformance and potential on offer, broking houses should perhaps take a closer look at the company with a view to initiating coverage.\n\nThree houses here do cover our next featured stock, Israeli diamond firm Sarine Technology, which sank to just 8 cents five years ago in the wake of the US subprime crisis but has since risen a staggering 32 times to $2.57. The three brokers are Maybank Kim Eng, Macquarie and CIMB, all with \"buy\" recommendations with target prices of $3.09, $2.78 and $2.59, respectively.\n\nThis year alone, Sarine's shares have gained almost 40 per cent; in the past 12 months, the rise has been almost 90 per cent. At present levels, Bloomberg gives Sarine's historic PE as 28 and prospective as 22 - slightly stretched but there's not too much cause for concern yet.\n\nBefore proceeding to our third feature though, a word of caution is warranted. Talkmed and Sarine are not very liquid counters, with trades averaging a few hundred thousand shares per day. (In yesterday's session, Sarine traded 1.05 million shares but 750,000 came from two married deals.)\n\nIf for any reason there is forced selling of shares pledged as collateral, prices could plunge as it does not take a lot of selling (or buying for that matter) to effect large price changes. So, even though both companies appear well-supported by earnings, traders should bear this in mind.\n\nOur third stock isn't afflicted by poor liquidity. Oil and gas play Ezion Holdings' shares are always actively traded. Its performance over the past five years is just behind Sarine's - the stock has slowly crept up from 8 cents in early 2009 to $2.10 today. It has been an active player in the local corporate scene. Barely a few months after its takeover bid for Ocean Sky failed to materialise, Ezion is now proposing to buy a controlling stake in Catalist's JK Tech that may eventually lead to a full-fledged takeover bid.\n\nAlthough the news has helped JK Tech's shares to treble, it hasn't really had much of an impact on Ezion's shares, which have fallen slightly since the announcement. Still, with 11 houses covering the company and target prices as high as $3.26 (from DBS Vickers) and with several above $2.50, Ezion's outperformance could well continue.\n\nSceptics might argue that three swallows do not a summer make, but rest assured that there are many more to be found. For now, these three will have to suffice to make the point that when it comes to the local stock market, large outperformance is highly possible.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The asking price for the freehold property, which is zoned for residential use, is $55 million. This\n\nworks out to $875 per square foot of potential gross floor area inclusive of an $18.2 million estimated development charge payable to the state.\n\nThis unit land price is believed to be similar to the last round, when the property was offered for sale through a tender exercise that closed last July.\n\nThis time, the tender will close on May 21 and the property's owner, a low-profile Singaporean family, is offering it as a vacant site, having pulled down the old Hillview House industrial building earlier this year. Thus the owner met Urban Redevelopment Authority's Feb 23, 2014 deadline to cease industrial activities and clear the site in order to qualify for 1.92 plot ratio, including a 0.3 additional plot ratio.\n\nThe 43,557 sq ft site can be developed into a 10-storey condo project with about 83,630 sq ft maximum gross floor area. The plot is about 730 metres from the Hillview MRT Station, currently under construction on the Downtown Line.\n\nCloser to the station, the 99-year leasehold Hillview Peak condo site along Hillview Avenue fetched a top bid of $638 psf per plot ratio (psf ppr) at a state tender that closed in March 2012.\n\nThe Hillview House site is a stone's throw from Lam Soon Industrial Building, a 10-storey industrial building where Cambridge Industrial Trust last year sold its stake to Enviro-Hub Holdings and BS Capital, both controlled by Raymond Ng Ah Hua. The $140.8 million sale was for space that translates to 69.4 per cent strata share value in the freehold building.\n\nAccording to DTZ, which is marketing the former Hillview House site located at 1 Jalan Remaja, a new condo on the site can accommodate about 110 units with an average unit size of about 760 sq ft. \"Being located on elevated ground, a new project on this site will enjoy an alluring unobstructed view of the surrounding landed housing area and lush greenery of nearby nature parks such as Little Guilin and Bukit Timah Nature Reserve\", said DTZ.\n\n\"The Hillview area has matured into a popular and established residential enclave. The appeal of the property lies in its proximity to the lush greenery of nearby nature reserves as well as the MRT accessibility when the Downtown Line starts to serve the area in 2015,\" said Swee Shou Fern, director of DTZ's investment advisory services. Hillview Station will connect the Bukit Timah enclave with Botanic Gardens, Little India and the Marina Bay Financial Centre.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the course of doing so, he has become an impressive leader in his own right,\" said Richard D Fain, chairman and CEO of Royal Caribbean Cruises. \"In this new role, Adam will be able to put his broad worldview and strategic insights to use leading our varied cross-functional teams.\"\n\nApart from working with Mr Fain on the company's strategic direction, Mr Goldstein will oversee human resources, information technology, supply chain, corporate communications, safety & environment, government relations, guest port operations and commercial development.\n\nMr Goldstein joined the company in 1988, and served in a number of positions before helming Royal Caribbean International, including as senior vice-president of total guest satisfaction and marketing and as corporate secretary to the company's board of directors. \"Royal Caribbean was a five-ship company when I arrived here, and today we are many times larger than that,\" Mr Goldstein said.\n\nMr Goldstein begins his new responsibilities immediately, Mr Fain said. A search for a new leader for the Royal Caribbean International line is under way. Mr Goldstein will assist in the transition alongside his new responsibilities.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth/wealth-investing/when-bond-funds-think-outside-box", "site_title": "When bond funds think outside the box", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nWhen bond funds think outside the box\n\nNon-traditional bond funds, which can own debt instruments of any type, are becoming popular with investors eager for higher yields\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Apr 8, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nUNCONSTRAINED bond funds can own debt instruments of any type - long or short-term, high or low-quality, corporate or government or whatever, in any country and currency - to try to enhance returns. With interest rates near record lows and investors eager to bolster yields, enthusiasm for these portfolios, also known as non-traditional funds, seems boundless, too.\n\nThe level of assets in non-traditional bond funds tracked by Morningstar rose about 80 per cent last year, to US$123 billion. They continued to attract fresh money early this year, reaching US$132 billion in assets at the end of February. How richly have shareholders been rewarded for these funds' ability to go anywhere in search of the best performance? Not very. The average non-traditional bond fund returned 0.3 per cent last year and 1.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nUnconstrained can mean unprofitable, it turns out, and it can mean riskier, too, versus conventional bond funds, investment advisers warn. While the freedom to hold any type of bond can make unconstrained funds valuable portfolio additions, it's essential to use the freedom wisely, they say. Some managers may be taking on too much risk to satisfy investors who are fed up with the low income of many bonds.\n\n\"People tell us they're not looking at regular bonds; they want unconstrained. They want 5 to 6 per cent yields,\" said Laird Landmann, co-director of fixed income at the TCW fund management company. \"It's an end-of-cycle dynamic. When people are reaching for yield, it's a warning sign that they want to take more risk at the wrong time. I'm not sure that unconstrained funds will protect investors if the cycle turns.\" Running unconstrained funds is tricky: They are effective only if managers are imaginative in allocating assets and are neither too bold nor too timid.\n\n\"Some funds might have wanted to benefit from the idea of being unconstrained, especially in 2013, when the average bond fund lost money,\" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of fund research at S&P Capital IQ, part of Standard & Poor's. \"In theory, these funds can go anywhere, but whether they do,\" and where they go, needs to be examined case by case, he said.\n\nAaron Izenstark, manager of the Iron Strategic Income fund, whose performance has ranked in the top 10 per cent of unconstrained bond funds during the last five years, sees many of these funds heading in one of two general directions. They either load up on higher-quality instruments like Treasury bonds, he said, which adds interest-rate risk if the maturities are long, or they concentrate on lower-quality debt and add credit risk.\n\n\"The average unconstrained fund is a simple bond fund,\" he said. \"It gives the manager leeway to do what he wants, but there's not a lot of creativity in most of them.\" For a fund to be truly unconstrained, in his view, it would have to be able to do more than just go into any market. It would also have to be able to sell bonds short to bet on falling prices and use derivative instruments to hedge exposure to different risks, like rising interest rates or falling currencies.\n\nDebt issuers\n\nWhere Mr Izenstark finds too much creativity is among debt issuers who, he contends, are dumping paper of dubious quality, including securitised subprime mortgages, the scourge of the 2007-9 financial crisis, on credulous investors.\n\n\"You have to be very careful in some of these spaces,\" he warns. \"People want it, so you have someone make it, even if it's absolute garbage. These things that are coming out, it's not that it's not a great time to be in them. It's a great time to sell them.\" Mr Izenstark had almost no allocation to securitised loans or to government bonds at the end of February, the most recent period for which such information was available. The portfolio was 87 per cent invested in corporate bonds, compared with 12 per cent for the average non-traditional bond fund that Morningstar tracks.\n\nMr Landmann, who is also a co-manager of Metropolitan West Strategic Income, a TCW fund with the best five-year results among unconstrained bond funds, noted that when funds in the group have produced especially high returns in recent years, it has been by taking greater credit risk. That adds another type of risk that shareholders may not realise. Price movements in stocks and lower-quality bonds are highly correlated - both are manifestations of risk-seeking - so some funds may not provide the diversification for a broad portfolio that conventional bond funds do.\n\n\"Unconstrained funds are supposed to have strategies that provide high returns and protect you from trouble,\" he said, \"but 50 per cent of the universe is just credit funds or equity funds in another guise.\" The unconstrained fund of which he is a co-manager has lower exposure to high-yield debt than other funds in the category, Mr Landmann said.\n\nThe ability of managers to own anything can make it hard for investors who are still interested in this niche to choose a suitable fund. \"Everything unconstrained goes in the same box,\" Mr Rosenbluth said, \"but unconstrained, by definition, does not go in a box.\" That makes it vital to inspect the contents before buying.\n\n\"Try to understand where they're investing,\" he said. \"If you combine it with other bond funds, you need to know how it fits in. Are its holdings long or short-term, government or credit, US or foreign? Understand where they've gone most recently and how quick the turnover is.\" Because these funds can go anywhere, Mark Balasa, chief investment officer of Balasa Dinverno & Foltz, a financial advice firm in Itasca, Illinois, encourages investors to focus on those run by firms best equipped for the journey.\n\n\"One of the keys to using an unconstrained fund is to understand the organisation behind it,\" he said. \"You need one that can pull the trigger on all those pieces - high yield, emerging markets, bank debt.\" He pointed out, though, that such grand scope has drawbacks. \"You need size for economies of scale and research capability,\" he said, \"but you need to be small enough not to move markets.\" That caveat aside, Mr Balasa recommended funds from three of the largest providers: BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities, JPMorgan Strategic Income Opportunities and Pimco Unconstrained Bond.\n\nMr Rosenbluth advises investors to keep an eye on the operating costs of unconstrained funds. The average one has annual total expenses of 1.7 per cent, very high for a bond portfolio. Three funds that S&P recommends for being run well and economically are MainStay Unconstrained Bond, Putnam Diversified Income Trust and the one from BlackRock.\n\nMr Landmann warns that this isn't a time for bond funds or their shareholders to take on undue risk. \"The time to be aggressive in a non-traditional fund was a year or two ago,\" he said. \"Now it's time to be conservative. The traditional way to protect yourself from a turn in the credit cycle is long-duration Treasury bonds. That's still true; it's probably the best hedge.\" - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/899770f0e02481d5be525b7b6163147e66942adcd400cbdfcee264ef960af6e3?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Attracting interest: The level of assets in non-traditional bond funds tracked by Morningstar rose about 80 per cent last year, to US$123 billion.

Both retail malls have a total net lettable area of about 900,000 sq ft and are fully leased.\n\nThe Clementi Mall has completed the first lease renewal cycle and more than 90 per cent of the tenants, by net lettable area, have committed for another lease term.\n\nBoth Paragon and Clementi Mall are \"expected to turn in a steady performance\", supported by positive macroeconomic conditions as reflected by sturdy retail sales and visitor arrivals as well as continued low unemployment rates, the Reit's manager said in the financial report.\n\nThe combined valuation of the two malls was $3.1 billion as at Feb 28, based on the average of two valuations by CBRE and DTZ.\n\nAccording to the Reit manager, SPH Reit does not require refinancing until 2016.

The survey, which was conducted online between November last year and January this year, included professionals in the fields of property development and investment, fund management, project management, quantity surveying and agency at all levels, from assistants and trainees to managers and executive directors.\n\nThe results from the survey reflect the different stages of development for the property sectors in various Asian markets, said Peter Moore, managing director of MacDonald and Company. Malaysia, with the highest salary growth rate, is struggling to attract more people into the real estate sector as its domestic market continues to do well, and as Malaysian investors and developers take up overseas ventures, he added.\n\nBoth Singapore and Hong Kong, representing smaller and more mature markets, still experienced substantial salary growth as both regions' real estate market players invest overseas as well.\n\n\"With increasing international aspirations of Singaporean developers and investors moving principally from looking east (particularly to China) to now looking west, we expect remuneration to continue to increase in Singapore,\" Mr Moore said.\n\nChina, where a property bubble is looming, had the slowest remuneration growth rates.\n\nDespite this, real estate professionals in China still enjoy the highest average salary per annum (US$138,400), compared to their Singaporean (US$125,580), Hong Kong (US$98,929) and Malaysian (US$71,804) counterparts.\n\nRising salaries alone, however, do not make for a satisfying career. Some 62 per cent of all respondents, up from 60 per cent last year, are fairly or very likely to change jobs in the next 12 months as they feel underpaid, dislike their companies' senior management styles and/or will seek more interesting work elsewhere.\n\nAcross the region, 48 per cent of respondents expect an increase in economic activity compared to 40 per cent last year, while 11 per cent believe it will decrease (down from 12 per cent). Those working in Singapore are generally the most optimistic, with 55 per cent expecting an increase in economic activity. Only 40 per cent of those working in China expect such an increase.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He is the deputy managing director of Evergreen Shipping Agency (S) and director of the RTW Group of Companies.\n\nAnnouncing the award at the annual Seatrade Asia Awards, Seatrade chairman Chris Hayman said: \"In 40 years' service in shipping, Patrick Phoon has been a major contributor to the development to the maritime community here in Singapore and across Asia.

However, American carriers bucked the trend with their shares edging up 4 per cent on the back of a stronger financial performance.\n\nOn the financial front, Q4 results indicate that airlines are continuing to improve financial performance at the operating level. A sample of 16 North American carriers showed they closed Q4 2013 with a net profit of US$1.59 billion, versus a loss of US$289 million in Q4 2012. In contrast however, a sample of 18 Asia-Pacific carriers reported a net profit of US$204 million in Q4 2013, down from US$1.5 billion in the corresponding quarter a year earlier.\n\nIata noted that the improvements are not widespread as airlines in the Asia-Pacific continue to show weakness.\n\nIn Q1 2014, however, global airline shares have risen some 13 per cent year on year, going by data from Thomson Reuters, outperforming the market as the FTSE Global All Cap remained flat.\n\nSingapore Airlines (SIA), which hit a high of $10.52 and a low of $10.09 in the month of March, closed at $10.30 yesterday, down nine cents. Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific ended yesterday's trading at HK$14.10, losing two Hong Kong cents. This was down from its low of HK$14.46 in March. Meanwhile, Australia's Qantas Airways gained one Australian cent to close at A$1.155 yesterday, edging ahead of its high of A$1.15 during the month of March.\n\nDuring the month under review, jet fuel prices eased 4 per cent from February to US$121 per barrel as crude oil prices declined slightly, although jet fuel has been trending in a high band since early 2011.\n\n\"Although demand conditions continue to improve, consistent with the pick-up in global economic growth, crude oil prices eased over recent weeks on the expectation that supply could rise with the opening of Libyan ports that have been blocked for the past eight months,\" Iata said in its report.\n\nOn the other hand, passenger yields remain weak in other regions, even as they stabilise in the US thanks to rising demand and consolidation within the industry.\n\nGlobal fares (in US$) remain weak, dragged down by the Asian carriers as well as currency rate distortions, although fuel surcharges and ancillary revenue - which are not taken into account when tabulating fare data - help provide some relief in this respect, Iata said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Today is exactly one month after the plane went missing. The black box only has power to send signals for about 30 days. Fortunately, the signals detected by Australia's Ocean Shield defence vessel yesterday seems consistent with those emitted by black box flight recorders. Otherwise, the best efforts of debris spotters using an formidable array of assets from United States, China, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan, Britain and Malaysia scouring an area some 2,000km west of Perth, where it is believed the Boeing 777 with 239 people came down, have found nothing.\n\nHowever, some lessons from this tragic and troubling event are obvious. The human response to shock and grief varies from culture to culture. When handling distraught relatives and friends, it is important to communicate effectively in a simple, consistent and coherent manner - and in the vernacular. Given that these days people from different countries use each other's airlines, crisis management teams must include people who can speak many languages. It is also important that crisis managers be equipped with the psychological skills to emotionally connect with distraught relatives and friends. Certainly, it serves no good to compare one group's reaction with another in public.\n\nAs for aircraft security, some technological advances are already in use in other parts of the world. After the Air France 447 crash in the Atlantic in 2009, the European Union began monitoring flights from takeoff to landing and the system is now common on North Atlantic routes. It is time the regional airlines fell in step. As well, aircraft manufacturers should fit their cockpit voice recorders and flight data recorders with batteries that last 90 days, instead of 30 days as the technology is already available. Airlines using aircraft with older recorders must upgrade. And at a time when digital data storage capacity is both cheap and increasing exponentially, it seems strange that cockpit voices are recorded for only up to two hours. Certainly, the next generation of aircraft should have equipment to record conversations for the entire duration of the flight, perhaps even in video. And there must be additional protocols in place before recording equipment can be turned off manually during a flight.\n\nOf course, it goes without saying that scrutiny of passengers and their passports before they board an aircraft must be fool-proof. That two passengers with false passports - even if they are now not deemed to have been hijackers - were able to get on MH370 reflects a failure of Malaysia's border security system that will hurt its reputation as a safe tourist destination, at least in the short term. Yet, it must be accepted that there is always an element of chance in every undertaking and in every journey. Sadly, life cannot be made fail-safe.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

CNR Tangshan, located in China's Hebei province, is the country's first railway equipment manufacturing company.\n\nThe contracts will see Jilin Midas supply aluminium alloy extrusion profiles and certain fabricated parts for high-speed trains that will operate at speeds of up to 350km/h.\n\nSlated for delivery this year, these contracts are expected to \"contribute positively\" to Midas' financial performance for the current financial year ending Dec 31, mainboard-listed Midas Holdings said yesterday.\n\nThis is the second time that Midas Holdings has secured orders for high-speed train car body components from CNR Tangshan since China reopened tenders last August.\n\nIn October 2013, Midas secured deals worth 167.5 million yuan from CNR Tangshan and CNR Changchun Railway Vehicle Company.\n\nSaid Midas executive director and CEO Patrick Chew: \"These new orders further strengthen our order book and are an endorsement of our customers' confidence in Midas' capabilities.

The open market value of Changi City Point as at March 1 was determined by Knight Frank to be $306 million, and by Colliers to be $304 million.\n\nIn a statement, FCT said that it planned to finance the purchase with a combination of equity and debt financing. This will ensure that the acquisition is distribution per unit (DPU)-accretive to FCT unitholders, while maintaining an optimum level of gearing.\n\nEquity financing may be in the form of a private placement of new FCT units, said the statement.\n\nDetails of the financing structure will be set out in a circular to be sent out to all unitholders in due course.\n\nThe proposed acquisition of Changi City Point - a three-storey retail mall in Changi Business Park, located opposite the Singapore Expo MRT station - will take the total number of suburban retail malls in FCT's portfolio to six.\n\nIt will also increase FCT's total assets by about 14 per cent to $2.4 billion, said FCAM chief executive officer Chew Tuan Chiong.\n\n\"This acquisition will strengthen FCT's ability to deliver regular and stable distributions to its unitholders, and unitholders can expect this acquisition to be DPU-accretive,\" he said.\n\nThe mall, which began operations in November 2011, has a total net lettable area of just over 207,000 sq ft. It had a 97.8 per cent occupancy rate as at end-February, and a leasehold estate of 60 years from April 30, 2009.\n\nThe mall is home to Very Special Arts Singapore, a charity providing opportunities for people with disabilities to access the visual, performing and literary arts for the purpose of rehabilitation and social integration.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Prices for three- and four-room units rose by 0.5 per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively as more buyers sought units with smaller quantums, given the loan cap under the Mortgage Servicing Ratio (MSR).\n\nPrices of larger flats, however, softened by 0.2 per cent for five-room units and 0.7 per cent for executive flats from a month ago.\n\nOverall HDB resale prices slipped 4.9 per cent year-on-year in March, SRX flash estimates show.\n\nThe total number of resale transactions, however, jumped 40 per cent from February's 951 units to 1,319 in March - the highest monthly volume observed since October.\n\nOrangeTee managing director Steven Tan noted that more home buyers prefer to wait until after the Chinese New Year lull period before house-hunting.\n\nSome buyers are also \"lured back to the resale market by the low cash premium they have to pay due to weak market sentiment\", he added.\n\nProperty consultants are encouraged by the latest data from SRX, expecting that resale activity will pick up though prices might correct further.\n\n\"With this trend continuing, we may see transaction volume increase in the coming months as more buyers come back to the resale market in view of stabilising prices,\" said ERA Realty key executive Eugene Lim. He sees the rental market under pressure from new supply of completed private homes.\n\nHDB data showed an estimated 1,627 flats being rented in March - the highest rental volume in eight months, while overall median rental prices remained flat at $2,300 for the fourth consecutive month.\n\nThis is the first time SRX is not publishing flash estimates for cash-over-valuation (COV) following its introduction of the X-value two weeks ago, which estimates the value of a property based on past transacted prices of comparable units.\n\nThe introduction of X-value came shortly after HDB tried to turn off the spotlight on COV by changing its resale process, requiring buyers to sign the option to purchase first before getting a valuation.\n\nSRX rolled out another price indicator yesterday - TOX or transactions over X-value - that looks at how much buyers pay over the X-value.\n\nThe median TOX for the HDB resale market in March stood at negative $3,000, which means that buyers are paying below recent transacted prices.\n\n\"Like the COV, TOX is a forward indicator on how heated the market is,\" said Jeremy Lee, co-founder of SRX, adding that SRX will start providing the median TOX by HDB towns and property types next month.\n\nSam Baker, co-founder of SRX, pointed out that TOX is a \"neutral measurement\" that is forward-looking but will not lead to prices spiralling higher or lower because the underlying X-value is based on past transactions.\n\nIn tandem with the negative TOX value, market watchers are expecting a downward trend in HDB resale prices.\n\n\"The trend is still towards a softening in resale prices at about 1-2 per cent per quarter as considerable demand for resale flats has already been siphoned to new build-to-order (BTO) flats while the MSR squeezes on affordability,\" said Ong Teck Hui, national director of research and consultancy at JLL.\n\nOng Kah Seng, director at R'ST Research, predicts a soft landing of resale HDB prices with a maximum 5 per cent fall for the full year, as the MSR will continue to limit the pool of eligible buyers while there will be more supply of resale flats in the second quarter.\n\nThere have been more than 60,000 requests for the X-value since its launch two weeks ago, according to SRX's Mr Lee. SRX will release the median TOX for the private residential market by district and property type next week.\n\nMr Lee noted that the X-value has closely tracked actual valuations so far, with about 98 per cent of all HDB resale transactions this year within a 10 per cent deviation from the actual valuations and about 81 per cent of transactions are within a 5 per cent deviation.\n\nSRX will roll out the X-value in Hong Kong by June based on data from the Hong Kong Land Registry.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However we need to remain equally focused on the 'softer side' of shipping such as customer service and information technology.\"\n\nMr Teo was speaking at an industry insights briefing yesterday ahead of the launch of Sea Asia 2015. He was joined on the panel by Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) of Singapore assistant chief executive (development) Tan Beng Tee; Singapore Maritime Foundation chairman and Keppel Offshore & Marine managing director (marine & technology) Michael Chia and Seatrade chairman Chris Hayman.\n\nMany of the biggest names in shipping are coming together through alliances to achieve cost efficiency and address the issue of overcapacity. Panellists at yesterday's event felt that there can be more collaboration, particularly to deal with the shortage of highly trained talent in the industry and environmental sustainability as these are issues that relate to the entire industry and are not unique to certain companies.\n\nThe world fleet is expanding at a rate of 2.3 per cent per annum, fast outstripping the supply of global maritime talent, according to the Singapore Shipping Association. A recent Bimco report also highlighted that the global supply of 624,000 officers was 13,000 short of demand, with 4,500 fewer workers employed in Singapore's maritime sector in 2012 compared with the previous year.\n\nMs Tan said MPA is focused on developing a \"pipeline of strong Singaporean talent\". Its Maritime Cluster Fund - Manpower Development (MCF-MD) was established to develop and attract talent. In 2013, MPA provided co-funding support to more than 4,400 participants of maritime training through the MCF-MD.\n\nThe development of new technology as well as the increased productivity of the existing workforce will help reduce the demand for personnel.\n\n\"We also need to work together to share ideas and technology to develop more environmentally friendly solutions,\" said Mr Teo.\n\n\"This is one focus area under the SMI Research and Development Roadmap. We are planning an R&D programme to pursue issues and opportunities related to ballast water and exhaust emission, among others,\" he said.\n\nMr Chia said that by working together to overcome these challenges, the maritime industry in Asia is set for future growth.\n\n\"The basic driving force behind shipping will be the growth of the Asian economies. We see China continuing to grow. Asean has a reasonable growth pace; India is coming up and Vietnam is a hidden tiger. These economies will continue to sustain shipping.\"\n\nThe challenges and opportunities facing the region's maritime industry will be the focus of next year's Sea Asia, and Mr Hayman claimed that \"Sea Asia's importance in the global maritime calendar continues to grow\".\n\n\"Last year's exhibition was attended by more than 13,000 participants from 68 countries, and featured 385 maritime businesses from 39 countries. Next year's event will be even bigger . . . The exhibition will grow by over 30 per cent to accommodate greater interests and showcase more services and new products,\" he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The tailwinds from improving global trade will offset the headwinds from the tightening of global financial markets, it added.\n\nThe report may thus allay concerns that the monetary \"tapering\" by the US Federal Reserve could be a serious dampener on Asia and other developing regions of the world, although the World Bank warned that there is no room for complacency and that policy reforms need to continue throughout the region.\n\n\"Developing countries of the East Asia and the Pacific region successfully navigated the stalled global economic recovery in the first half of 2013 and the expectations of a scaling back of quantitative easing in the second half, to grow by 7.2 per cent in 2013 - only marginally lower than the 7.4 per cent in 2012,\" said World Bank.\n\n\"Growth is expected to remain at 7.1 per cent in 2014 as well as in 2015 and 2016.\"\n\nThese forecasts are similar to those made last week by the Asian Development Bank, which had suggested that growth in the developing economies of Asia as a whole should accelerate slightly this year and the next.\n\nThe bulk of growth in the developing economies of East Asia last year was attributable to China, which grew at 7.7 per cent last year, matching the rate in 2012 and exceeding the government target of 7.5 per cent, the World Bank noted in its report.\n\nGrowth in China is expected to decrease marginally to 7.6 per cent this year and to 7.5 per cent next year.\n\nMeanwhile, the larger economies within Asean are operating close to potential and facing tighter global financial conditions and higher levels of household debt, the World Bank said.\n\n\"In 2014, growth is expected to slow in Indonesia (to 5.3 per cent) and the Philippines (to 6.6 per cent), remain unchanged in Thailand (3.0 per cent) and accelerate modestly in Malaysia (4.9 per cent).\"\n\nNo forecast was made for Singapore, which is not classified as a developing economy.\n\nAfter deteriorating in the first half of last year, the trade and current account balances of several East Asia Pacific countries have improved on the back of rising external demand and weaker currencies, the World Bank noted.\n\nIn addition, foreign direct investment flows into the regions have remained robust, enabling them to offset portfolio outflows associated with the scaling back of the quantitative easing programme by the US.\n\n\"They have also further accumulated reserves to insure against temporary trade and external financial shocks.\"\n\nThe World Bank added that recent developments have reinforced the importance of having a flexible exchange rate regime to defend against external shocks, including capital flow reversals.\n\nWhile credit growth has started to slow down, the legacy of past credit booms remains a concern, especially among the region's larger economies, including China, it said.\n\nThe authorities in some large economies have employed macro-prudential measures to contain the risks arising from an asset price boom, including in the real estate market, the World Bank noted.\n\n\"China's priority is to further reduce total credit growth in the economy, which is still well above nominal Gross Domestic Product growth.\n\n\"There are modest fiscal consolidation efforts underway in several countries, with an emphasis on rationalising fuel and rice subsides, although more needs to be done to rebuild policy buffers and create space for priority spending.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It reduced its CO2 emissions by 12 per cent per container-kilometre last year, after having cut these emissions by 11 per cent between 2011 and 2012.\n\nA company spokesman said Maersk was now aiming for a CO2 cut of 40 per cent per container-kilometre between 2007 and 2020; to date, with six years to 2020, it has already achieved a 34 per cent cut.\n\nThese figures were disclosed at a briefing held yesterday by Maersk to launch its Sustainability Progress Update in Singapore.\n\nIn terms of sulphur emissions (SOx), the shipping line's global emissions last year were recorded at 488,000 tonnes, a reduction of 67,000 tonnes or 12 per cent from 2012's levels.\n\nMaersk chief executive S\u00f8ren Skou said: \"2013 was a good year for Maersk Line - financially as well as in terms of our sustainability performance. Our fuel efficiency improvements helped cut CO2 as well as air pollutants like SOx and NOx (nitrogen emissions). So even while our business grew, we were able to reduce our environmental impact in absolute terms.\"\n\nThe reduction in CO2 was achieved through a major overhaul of 137 of its container ships - nearly half its owned fleet of 250 vessels.\n\nJacob Sterling, the company's head of sustainability, said at the briefing that what set this retrofitting apart from others undertaken before was that the ships were taken out of service this time for multiple retrofits done all at one go.\n\nSuch a large-scale overhaul can raise a ship's efficiency by 15 to 20 per cent, comparable to the gains made from buying a new eco-ship, he said. The resulting boost to fuel efficiency saved the company US$764 million in 2013 alone.\n\nOne of the challenges outlined in the sustainability update is the tightening of SOx regulations, which will require ships sailing in emission-control areas to switch to cleaner - and more expensive - fuels from January 2015.\n\nMr Sterling said: \"Air emissions are a serious issue in shipping and we support the upcoming regulation, but we are concerned about the level of enforcement in Europe. The new regulation will be costly, and, without proper enforcement, some (parties) may be tempted to cut corners. This will erode the environmental improvements and create a commercial disadvantage for those who follow the rules.\"\n\nIn Singapore, Maersk switched to cleaner fuels in mid-2011. Last year, this switch was credited with cutting SOx by around half - 478 tonnes, said Thomas Knudsen, chief executive for Maersk Line in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nHe lauded Singapore for being one of only three ports in the world that will take action on SOx emissions, and singled out the Singapore Green Port Programme for praise, though he said still more could be done on that front.\n\nSeparately, at an industry insights briefing yesterday, ahead of the launch of Sea Asia 2015, Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) of Singapore assistant chief executive for development Tan Beng Tee said Singapore will not make it mandatory for ships coming in to comply with emission standards, given the industry's current woes.\n\nInstead, MPA will continue working with the industry through events such as the Singapore Maritime Week and offer incentives such as lower port dues to encourage shipping lines to lower their sulphur emissions, he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

From MPA, we are working with the SGX (Singapore Exchange) and the industry, to see what more we can do to profile the exchange (SGX) as a good place for companies which would like to list.\"\n\nMs Tan, however, said these efforts would take some time to yield results.\n\nSpeaking as part of a panel at an industry insights briefing yesterday ahead of the launch of Sea Asia 2015, Ms Tan suggested that a reason for the relatively lower listing rate of shipping companies in Singapore could be historical.\n\n\"If you compare between Singapore, Oslo and the US, in a way they have a longer history of listing of maritime stocks as compared to Singapore.\"\n\nMoreover, she said that Singapore may not be attracting many listings from companies in deep sea shipping, as the stocks in this segment are still languishing in line with the relatively weak market. \"But if you look at the offshore sector, then the number of stocks that have been listed in Singapore, and their showing, has been pretty good,\" she added.\n\nShe illustrated the listing of Pacific Radiance last year as an example of an offshore shipping stock where the \"uptake of the stock was good\" and the \"share prices were also to the expectation (of the company)\".\n\nAs the broad shipping sector recovers from a slowdown from the 2009 global economic crisis, corporate activity in the industry has been significant. More than US$16 billion of capital has been raised for the global shipping and offshore segments since January 2013, according to Rahul Khemka, director (strategic advisory) at DNB Markets. The trend is still strong this year as Mr Khemka pointed out that until March 26, this year alone, approximately US$3 billion has already been raised by firms in these segments.\n\n\"A majority of the (capital markets) activity has been focused on the shipping sector, reflecting improving market fundamentals and investor sentiment across several shipping segments,\" Mr Khemka said at DNB's Asia Maritime Conference 2014 recently.\n\nHowever, the majority share of capital raised since January 2013 has been done through the Norwegian and US capital markets - which, he revealed, together account for about 90 per cent of all equity capital markets activity in these sectors.\n\n\"Over 30 per cent of these issuances have been by new issuers via IPOs or private placements, suggesting that the market is open to new and good quality cases,\" Mr Khemka noted. The segments that have seen key corporate activity in the shipping sector in 2013 were the dry bulk, product tankers, cruise, LPG, drilling rigs and diversified offshore services. For this year, the dry bulk, LPG and crude tankers have been the stand-out segments in terms of the level of corporate activity.\n\nEven Singapore-based LPG shipping company Epic Gas tapped into the Norwegian market to raise US$75 million through the private placement of new shares this January.\n\nShipping finance people believe that part of the lure of shipping companies to Norway and the US is because these markets have traditional maritime sectors.\n\n\"(Despite) there being a great skills base here, with the banks and the owners all here (in Singapore), it remains an Oslo and New York-based business. Investors there are very experienced, and they have been through a number of cycles,\" Nigel Anton, global head of shipping finance at Standard Chartered, said at a recent Standard Chartered Shipping Finance media roundtable.\n\nOthers suggest that the reasons could be more regulatory. A shipping finance professional, who chose to remain unnamed, said that while the marketing and business development side of the SGX understands and values the importance of attracting shipping companies to the markets here, more flexibility may be needed by the SGX on the regulatory side of things to achieve this.\n\nStill, as Mr Anton noted, the authorities here are keen to see more shipping corporate activity here and are in discussion with industry professionals to see how they can do that. \"There is no reason that can't change. That can happen but it will take time, but in the meantime, companies will just go to the market that have done so well - Norway and the US.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Banks here see opportunities to tap the Chinese trade directly.\n\nAnother advantage is through a form of trade financing known as discounting, bankers say. A supplier issues an invoice to a buyer, but gets a certain proportion of the expected payment from a bank, or the discounter, for a fee. The bank offers the funds after reviewing the invoice.\n\nThe initial goal is for the supplier to get funds quicker. And given the attractive offshore rates, a Chinese supplier can choose to obtain more offshore yuan - which is mostly fungible - from a Singapore bank.\n\nOnce the supplier gets money from the buyer, it then repays the bank with interest charges.\n\nWhether this arbitrage play continues will depend on how quickly China liberalises its interest rates, bankers say.\n\nEarlier this year, a depreciation of the onshore yuan - which is mainly measured against the US dollar - was engineered by the People's Bank of China, partly to prepare the rates' pricing system for liberalisation. It also stemmed out some speculation over single-minded bets on the direction of the currency: up.\n\nIn a report on Monday, CIMB Research noted that though some of the trade volumes - as fuelled by currency arbitrage - may come down as the arbitrage gap narrows, the moderation would not lift the number of non-performing loans of DBS.\n\nAnd from Mr McCabe's point of view, the currency play is less critical. \"The fact of the matter is, whether a customer finances in renminbi or Sing dollars, it doesn't matter. They are still shipping fuzzy bears from one point to another,\" he said.\n\nIf a Chinese company is growing its business within the country, it may want its trades transacted in yuan to keep up with its working capital requirements.\n\nBut if a mainland company is looking at acquisitions overseas, it would make sense for the company to use more US dollars, said Mr McCabe.\n\nThis reflects the foreign exchange risk and cash management issues that banks review on behalf of clients through their transaction services known as sweeping and pooling.\n\nFor example, a Singapore company holding numerous bank accounts in their overseas markets would eventually want most of the money held in those accounts to be brought home.\n\nThe banks are paid to serve companies in ensuring that they hold just enough foreign dollars to meet working capital requirements for their overseas operations.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

You have to tunnel a long way - and to find a sufficiently big plot (of land) in the city in order to build the railway station is not easy.\"\n\nTuas West makes sense because it is close to the Singapore-Malaysia border, and so is Jurong East which will become a major transportation, economic and financial zone for Singapore, Mr Lee said.\n\n\"Because it is (in) the Jurong Lake district and many things are happening at Jurong East,\" he said. \"We will decide within the next year or so.\"\n\nThe idea of a Singapore-Kuala Lumpur rail was hatched between Mr Lee and Mr Najib at last year's retreat meeting. It is due to have seven stations, including a terminal station in Singapore and another in the Malaysian capital. There will be three stations in Johor Bahru and one each in Negri Sembilan and Malacca.\n\nProperty consultants The Business Times spoke to also point to Tuas West and Jurong East as likely locations to site the terminal. Of the three, Jurong East offers a compromise in terms of cost and connectivity. Building costs fall between the other two locations, and though not matching up to the city area, Jurong East is better connected to the rest of Singapore than Tuas West, they said.\n\nIt would make sense for the terminal to be located near the MRT station, said Christine Li, OrangeTee's head of research and consultancy. But finding the right location will be challenging considering the multiple developments in the area, she added.\n\nEven so, siting the terminal in Jurong East will improve its position as a regional centre. Chesterton Singapore's managing director, Donald Han, said that the terminal would be a magnet for businesses and people to locate there. CBRE research head Desmond Sim reckoned that developments there would likely \"synergise and benefit most\".\n\nBesides being close to the border, Tuas West, which is under developed with more available land, would offer the cheapest construction costs with minimal disruptions, said industry players. Ms Li said that Tuas West was considered possibly because of the port shift.\n\nBut the mostly industrial area is far from other parts of Singapore.\n\nNicholas Mak, SLP International's executive director said that this can be overcome by ensuring good access to public transport systems. But Jones Lang LaSalle's national director for research and consultancy, Ong Teck Hui, said that for travellers into Singapore, another 30 minutes to the city would be a \"significant add-on to the 90-minute journey\".\n\nA terminal in the city would no doubt have the best connectivity for both travellers and locals. But land is prime with higher opportunity costs. Besides, construction work would cause more inconvenience. Mr Han of Chesterton Singapore pointed to the existing Tanjong Pagar railway station at Keppel Road and the KTM rail corridor as a more cost-effective way of locating the terminal in the city. Land acquisition costs would be reduced, said Mr Han.\n\nWhile he said that Jurong East would be a likely candidate, having the terminal in Marina South, especially near the cruise centre, would create a \"multi-nodal transport hub\". Mr Han added it could push the expansion of the Central Business District into the Southern waterfront corridor.\n\nMr Najib said yesterday that the terminal station in Kuala Lumpur will be located in Bandar Malaysia, at the current Air Force base in Sungai Besi, which has been earmarked for redevelopment into a mixed use community and commercial district.\n\nMr Lee said that the high-speed rail is a \"very major cooperation project which will preoccupy us for several years to come\".\n\nHe added: \"Officials have been working hard and there are many items here to discuss and settle: the design, the financing, the governance, the operations, the security and immigration requirements, the legal arrangements.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, both Singapore and Malaysia leaders are sticking to the 2020 deadline for now. \"That's quite an ambitious target,\" Mr Najib conceded. \"(But) we wanted it to be an ambitious target so that we become very, very focused and the entire weight of both governments will be directed at this.\"\n\nMr Lee added: \"I think 2020 is a good target to work for. It will be very challenging to achieve, but we don't think we should relax the constraint yet.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Malaysia is keen to push two new initiatives raised at the latest retreat, the fifth since it kicked off in May 2007 in Langkawi by Mr Lee and former Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi. The two new initiatives are \"a joint border control at a single checkpoint\" and a long-term \"Friendship Bridge\" to provide a third road link between the two countries.\n\nThe Friendship Bridge is another variation which has been raised by Malaysian leaders since 2003. Mr Lee said that Singapore's current preoccupation is to improve the flow of traffic at its Custom and Immigration Quarantine (CIQ) checkpoint, but it recognises a need to widen the links across the Straits of Johor in the long term. This is already being looked into by the Singapore and Malaysian ministers studying cross-border road linkage.\n\nMr Lee is agreeable to co-location of the CIQ, especially for the new links such as the Rapid Transit System linking Johor and Singapore and the high-speed rail. But he said that it is harder to do for the existing links, because the CIQ is already built.\n\nWith additional reporting by Sheena Tan in S'pore\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They welcomed the ongoing talks between the various agencies of the two countries on collaboration in vocational training.\n\nSpeaking of the win-win gains for both Singapore and Malaysia in cooperating in Iskandar at a joint press conference, Mr Lee said: \"The great advantage of Iskandar Malaysia is that it's across the Straits of Johor, and that means that you can tap on what Singapore offers in terms of infrastructure, in terms of services, in terms of industrial base.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Mr Lee said that Iskandar Malaysia also offers options to Singapore-based companies looking to expand and those facing land constraints in Singapore. \"We are upgrading our manufacturing (sector) . . . our economy but there are many projects which want to come, which we are not able to accommodate in Singapore. When we have a good project, we can talk to Iskandar or talk to Mida (Malaysian Investment Development Authority) and they can look at it and see whether it fits into Malaysia's plans.\"\n\nBoth Mr Lee and Mr Najib recognised the strategic importance of Iskandar Malaysia for Singapore and Malaysia and its contribution to \"greater cooperation between the two countries and the integration of their economies\".\n\nThey \"noted with satisfaction\" especially \"the progress made in jointly developing industries with synergistic activities in both Singapore and Iskandar Malaysia by the Industrial Cooperation Work Group under the Malaysia-Singapore Joint Ministerial Committee for Iskandar Malaysia\". These include UK-based metal-stocklist Howco Group's decision to build a US$20 million heat treatment facility in Iskandar Malaysia to complement its Singapore operations.\n\nThe leaders also welcomed the development of the new Nusajaya Tech Park, a joint venture between Ascendas and UEM Sunrise Berhad. The 210-hectare tech park will be opened to both multinational corporations and local small and medium enterprises in industries such as precision engineering, electronics, light and clean manufacturing and warehousing and logistics.\n\nAccording to the joint statement, the Nusajaya Tech Park is expected to create jobs in high-tech industries and give a strong push to Iskandar Malaysia's development.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

One is the Australian Queensland Curtis LNG project, with a capacity of eight million tonnes per annum (mtpa), which is to supply Singapore and other markets in Q4; the other is the 5.5 mtpa US Sabine Pass terminal, which will soon start production.\n\nAlready, some 25 LNG companies like Gazprom and GDF Suez have set up trading operations here, and super majors like Shell and BP actively book their LNG trades through Singapore.\n\nMr Hill said: \"The more people there are here, the better it is for the Singapore market.\"\n\nHe added that while the Republic is clearly becoming \"a hub for LNG people\", it still has to grow, from both a physical trade and financial perspective.\n\nThe global LNG scene has changed in the last decade, he said; it has gone from having long-term sales deals by national oil companies to becoming a market with more intermediaries.\n\nLong-term contracts are essential for gas producers to underpin their costly LNG projects, but short-term LNG supply deals (those of four years or less) are going up in number, Mr Hill noted. About a fifth of BG's deals this year are short-term ones.\n\nBG was appointed in 2008 as the initial LNG buyer here with a franchise for three mtpa. It has, to date, delivered more than a million tonnes of LNG on board 20 vessels.\n\nAn innovation it introduced was to enable customers such as the gencos to buy spot LNG supplies in volumes that could be as little as a fraction of a cargo-load. Its website says this is a world first.\n\nDespite its apparent \"disadvantage\" in being the first Singapore LNG aggregator, Mr Hill said the group will take part in the coming Energy Market Authority's selection process for up to two LNG buyers for the next tranche of LNG needed here. BG will continue to support Singapore's plan to create a competitive LNG market and regional energy hub, he said.\n\nHe added that Singapore's status as an established global oil trading hub was another reason BG moved its LNG and oil marketing headquarters here.\n\nThe group is preparing for a spike in its oil shipments to Asia as production in its Brazil oilfield ramps up. BG expects to market the bulk of this ex-Singapore, which is why the company is building up its oil trading team here. It also hired an Asian oil trading head recently.\n\nBG now has more than 70 employees in its Singapore office and will step up this number with hires from universities here, who will be sent for stints in the group's overseas operations.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Payment delays by construction firms have almost doubled as the slowdown in the property market bites; they now take 61 days to pay up, from 32 days a year ago. Credit firms take 78 days to settle debts, up from 33 days a year ago.\n\n\"Cost has gone up substantially; of course, people are having cashflow problems,\" said a contractor, citing higher labour costs in the form of increases in various levies and fees and salary hikes as hitting the business.\n\n\"The moderation in construction-related activities is clearly underway as property sentiment cools under the cumulative weight of the macro-prudential measures amid a more challenging supply pipeline,\" said OCBC Bank economist Selena Ling.\n\n\"If you look at the construction sector growth in 2013, it already slowed from 8.6 per cent year-on- year in 2012 to 5.9 per cent last year, and we are forecasting growth to moderate further to average 3.6 per cent this year.\"\n\nWhile contracts awarded hit $35.8 billion (up 17 per cent year-on-year) last year, a significant portion of that was supported by public-sector construction demand (56 per cent higher at $15 billion) because of various Thomson MRT line contracts and public residential projects, she said.\n\nThe construction industry is undergoing change as large government infrastructure projects come to an end, said Ong Siew Kim, senior general manager of DP Information Group, adding that this was not a cause for concern at the moment.\n\n\"As one industry leader explained, the industry may be catching its breath after several boom years and companies are managing their cashflow while waiting to book new work,\" said Ms Ong.\n\nMs Ling said: \"It's probably not all doom and gloom since total construction output is still estimated at around $34-36 billion for 2014, but the driver clearly would be from the public sector, which will help to mitigate the downside risk from the private-sector construction demand.\"\n\nAs to how cashflow problems might affect the wider economy, she said that the key would be the pace of the slowdown in the property market. \"There is likely to be some spillover into other related sectors like business services, but the key is the pace of the slowdown and/or correction in the property market going forward.\"\n\nFrancis Tan, United Overseas Bank economist, said that the bureau's data alone is insufficient to conclude that there is a slowdown in the construction sector. \"We need to look at other indicators such as property price indices, rental indices, vacancy rates and projects in the pipeline to have better visibility of the sector outlook.\"\n\nThe bureau's findings are based on payments made by more than 120,000 corporations and small and medium-sized enterprises here each quarter.\n\nThe days turned cash (DTC) national average - a measure of the number of days a company takes to pay its creditor once the debt is due - increased from 39 days in Q4 2013 to 43 days in Q1 2014. The proportion of severely delinquent debts, defined as those still unpaid 90 days after they are due, rose from 18 per cent in Q4 2013 to 29 per cent in Q1 2014.\n\nStill, Ms Ong chose to put a positive spin on the situation. \"DP Info's analysis shows the deterioration in payment behaviour is not across all industries,\" she said, noting that 10 of the 14 industries tracked had in fact shown improvement in debt-payment behaviour. Indeed, payment delays in construction and credit had caused the DTC to go up.\n\nThe credit-related industry, which includes personal and commercial finance providers and unsecured money lenders, had registered large jumps in the first quarter previously, which suggests that the increase may be seasonal.\n\nFor example, there was a 19-day increase in payment times by credit-related companies in the first quarter last year, followed by a decrease in payment times in Q2 and Q3.\n\nMs Ong said: \"Many people find they overspend during the festive period between Christmas and Chinese New Year, causing them to delay in payments to creditors. This, in turn, places pressure on the cashflow and debt payment patterns of the lenders.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The shipping giant said yesterday that it registered a 3.8 million tonne carbon dioxide reduction in 2013 while the business grew 4.1 per cent.\n\nMaersk said large customers representing 19 per cent of its business have requested tailored sustainability information as part of their business relationship with the company.\n\nWhen contacted, Australia's ASX Group said it is aware of the global effort. And while there are now no rules requiring such disclosure, ASX - through the ASX Corporate Governance Council - on March 27 introduced a new sustainability recommendation in its latest edition of the Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations (CGPR).\n\n\"The CGPR set out recommended corporate governance practices for ASX- listed entities that, in the council's view, are likely to achieve good governance outcomes and meet the reasonable expectations of most investors in most situations,\" Matthew Gibbs, ASX's general manager of media and communications, told The Business Times.\n\nThe new recommendation requires a listed entity to disclose whether it has any material exposure to ESG risks and, if it does, how it manages those risks.\n\n\"The recommendations are not mandatory and recognise that entities may legitimately adopt different governance practices better suited to their particular circumstances. ASX requires entities to disclose their governance practices in relation to the recommendations on an 'if not, why not' basis,\" Mr Gibbs said.\n\nAs for Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEx), it began offering ESG resources in 2011. It arranged training in ESG reporting in September and October last year and added webcasts on the subject to its main website this year.\n\n\"The guide is part of the Listing Rules and currently a recommended best practice,\" a HKEx spokesman said. \"HKEx will monitor the work of the World Federation of Exchanges' new sustainability working group and will consider any recommendations from the group as and when appropriate.\"\n\nNo immediate comment was available from SGX.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is vital that Singapore taps new technologies to provide sustainable health-care solutions.\"\n\nThe three apps - Smart Ageing, Heartsmart and Health Abacus - each levy a monthly subscription fee of US$49.95; the minimum subscription period is three months.\n\nDelivered on a mobile app platform called \"Borderless Clinic\", the apps give their subscribers access to a secured platform for answers and advice from a global stable of medical specialists via phone, audio or video communication.\n\nDr Wei said that the company plans to have 100 specialists on board by year's end, and between 100,000 and 200,000 subscribers by then.\n\nParticipating doctors will get some revenue-sharing to compensate them for the time they spend, but Dr Wei said this would not be an avenue for them to earn big.\n\n\"Basically, it's a tool for doctors to extend a patient's education; they become more efficient, the patients understand what they say better,\" he said.\n\nTan Yong Seng, a cardiothoracic surgeon from Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre who contributed to the content on heart care and disease prevention in the Heartsmart and Health Abacus apps, said: \"Heart disease, stroke and cancer are all preventable diseases. The incidence is increasing with an ageing population. Hence, it is important that we empower our people with the right knowledge in disease prevention.\"\n\nHe noted, however, that the apps are only an initial step patients can take to chat with doctors, and are not substitutes for a medical consultation.\n\n\"Eventually, you still have to go and see the doctor,\" he said.\n\nBy the end of the year, BHG plans to have 50 apps in its portfolio, including those for pain management, infertility and for babies.\n\nSmart Ageing and Heartsmart are already available for Apple and Google devices; Health Abacus is expected to be ready by next week.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

If you call for it, a staff member whips out a handheld device, runs up your tab and handles credit card payments on the spot.\n\nIt's all chop-chop for the customer.\n\nFrom the management's point of view, the combined use of the iPad by customers to give orders and the iPod Touch by service staff to take orders has helped its 15 outlets here raise staff productivity. Ordering time, for example, has been slashed 65 per cent, and this is a big deal, considering that front-of-house staff members spent a lot of time taking orders, said Fish & Co management director Hoo Hoe Keat.\n\nThat is not all. The turnover of its tables has gone up, and errors in the transmission of orders has come down - and significantly too, he said.\n\nHe believes that Fish & Co, which incorporated the electronic devices into its operations in early 2012, is among the first here to do so.\n\nHe added, however, that the resulting quicker turnaround of tables has not meant that the restaurant chain can do with fewer staff, because it believes in providing its customers a \"full-service\" experience, including keeping up interaction with customers and meeting their requests - even during peak periods.\n\nMr Hoo said the company adopted technology to streamline the time-consuming process of taking orders precisely because it wanted to give its staff members \"sufficient bandwidth\" to take care of customers.\n\nIn typical restaurants, service staff would take orders down on slips of paper, then go to a point-of-sales (POS) station to key these in. As there are usually only a few such stations per restaurant, a backlog builds up during peak hours as service staff await their turn to use the terminal.\n\nBecause of this waiting, staff become less free to tend to customers' needs or, in their haste, they may key in orders wrongly by the time they get to use the POS station.\n\nAt Fish & Co, the use of the iPads and iPods are integrated; they have the menus onscreen and can send orders straight to a printer in the kitchen. Seated diners use the iPads and those waiting to be seated during peak hours can give their orders to staff, who use their iPods to transmit these to the kitchen.\n\nToday, 90 per cent of orders are made through the mobile devices. Because the mobile interface does not allow for much customisation, specific requests by customers are still made the old way.\n\nMr Hoo said making the transition to using the technology was not easy. The devices themselves were easy enough for service staff to pick up, but their long-time familiarity with the POS system also made them reluctant to switch over.\n\nMr Hoo said: \"When you are used to a certain system, certain habits are formed, and it's very difficult to break yourself out of them, out of that comfort zone. It's akin to a Windows user going onto an (Apple) iOS platform (or vice versa) - it takes a long time.\"\n\nGetting the system set up cost between $300,000 and $400,000, including the cost of a Wi-Fi network. Mr Hoo described the money spent as \"worthwhile and necessary\".\n\nThe iPad and iPod Touch aside, the restaurant chain introduced a third piece of hardware - a handheld device capable of printing bills and processing credit card transactions. These are in use at six of the 15 outlets - Tampines, Ang Mo Kio, Clementi, VivoCity, Paragon and the Glass House at Park Mall.\n\nInstead of asking customers to pay at the counter, which is what most restaurants do to speed up the billing process, the mobile device brings the bill to the customer. Not only is the transaction completed in under a minute, it is also more secure, as the customer's credit card stays within sight through the process.\n\nTechnological innovations can erase the service element of the restaurant experience, so a balance needs to be struck between the two.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So one of the tools is to increase the buffer.\"\n\nAustralian home prices last month had the biggest monthly gain on record, while Sydney prices climbed 15.6 per cent from a year earlier, according to the RP Data-Rismark Home Value Index. Banks are focusing on borrowers' capacity to repay after 2.25 percentage points of interest-rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia over almost two years pushed down home-loan costs to a 41/2 year low. Home lending grew 5.8 per cent in the 12 months to February, the fastest pace since September 2011.\n\nThe central bank is expected to start raising rates in the first quarter of next year, according to the median forecast of 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Once interest rates start to increase, house prices will stabilise as affordability deteriorates, Mr Chronican said.\n\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the central bank have been \"vigilant about any potential loosening of credit standards\" amid low mortgage rates and competition in the home loan market, the regulator said in its submission to the government's financial systems inquiry on March 31.\n\nMortgage lending will grow 6 per cent to 7 per cent annually, sustaining a recovery that began in early 2013, with demand coming from households that had in the past few years focused on \"savings rather than spending,\" Mr Chronican said.\n\nThe share of households favouring real estate as the best use of their savings has risen to a level approaching that of the early 2000s property market boom, the RBA said in its Financial Stability Review on March 26. Australian households' savings rate fell to 9.7 per cent in the final three months of last year, the first time it has dropped below 10 per cent since 2010.\n\nANZ, which has grown its mortgage market share for 16 consecutive quarters, expects to further increase its portion after doubling the number of branch staff qualified to write home loans and automating originations, said Mr Chronican, 57, who has been in his current role since November 2009 and before that headed the institutional bank of Westpac Banking Corp.\n\nCompetition is intensifying with bigger discounts and larger loans doled out by lenders to gain share, he said. \"Macquarie Bank, through its venture with Yellow Brick Road Holdings Ltd, has had a measurable impact,\" Mr Chronican said. \"The emergence of securitisation means lenders who were previously finding it difficult are more confident.\"\n\nMacquarie Group more than doubled mortgages in the year to Feb 28, according to data from APRA. Australian issuers sold A$26.1 billion (S$30.47 billion) of residential mortgage-backed securities last year, the most since 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nAustralian banks have further avenues to cut costs, Mr Chronican said, without elaborating. ANZ reported a cost-to-income-ratio of 44.8 per cent in the year ended September and wants to bring it down to 43 per cent by the end of 2016.\n\nPressure on net interest margin, a key measure of lending profitability, will continue though easing term deposit spreads will limit the decline, he said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

Throw another stone and you're likely to hit an old person with nowhere to have a proper sitdown meal with real tablecloths and napkins.\n\nBefore the latter becomes extinct - the restaurant, not the old person - the newly established Lewin Terrace is a valiant attempt to revive an era when going out to dinner was an occasion and not a \"what do you want to eat\" daily banality.\n\nIt may be an uphill climb for Lewin Terrace, and we don't just mean the stairs that lead up to this lovely black-and-white colonial bungalow that once housed the residence of Singapore's Central Fire Station's British chief. Its opening comes in the wake of the closure of Au Jardin in Botanic Gardens, and it also takes over the premises from former tenant, Flutes at the Fort, which has since relocated to the National Museum. With most fine-dining eateries downgrading to bistro and cafe level, can something like Lewin Terrace - which boasts no celebrity-chef connections, progressive cuisine nor hipster concept - make an impact on the local dining scene?\n\nIt probably depends on how people take to the idea of Japanese-French fine dining at the hands of Chef Ryoichi Kano and general manager/chief sommelier Daisuke Kawai, an alumnus of Les Amis.\n\nJust based on looks alone, the new operators get top marks for restoring the colonial splendour of the bungalow with its old-world ambience and tropical luxury-inspired decor. That alone will seal the deal for anyone looking for an intimate wedding venue or chi-chi party spot.\n\nOn the cuisine front, though, it's still a work in progress. Chef Ryoichi plays it far too safe with flavours too mild and execution too reticent to make you sit up and take notice.\n\nAt dinner, you are presented with only two choices - a $120 or $180 set menu with a couple of extra courses added to the more-expensive choice. The amuse bouche sets a placid tone with a refreshing shot glass of dashi jelly topped with vegetable puree; mushy gnocchi mismatched with a miso glaze and so-so deep-fried battered cucumber maki.\n\nThe dragon fruit carpaccio, meanwhile, is an artistic arrangement of sweet-fleshed segments that give way to a disappointing crab and avocado salad - salty and most likely made with average quality canned crabmeat.\n\nChef Ryoichi also seems to have an odd relationship with seaweed. It's as if he likes it but it doesn't like him - giving his otherwise delicate chawanmushi a sickly green pallor that distracts from an otherwise silky custard delicately flavoured with clam broth and studded with bits of prawn for texture. Despite the ugliness of the algae-looking green surface, it's a very tasty steamed egg delight.\n\nThe ugly seaweed phenomenon crops up again with one of the menu highlights - a perfectly fried piece of tile fish (amadai) with superb crunch from its edible scales, paired with a pan-fried risotto cake and submerged in fish broth in a smart take on Japanese chazuke or tea rice. This time, a scary-looking hijiki paste is mixed with tingly peppercorns that add an interesting earthiness to the dish, rounding off the flavours in a nice little package.\n\nWe also like the chef's clever interpretation of foie gras terrine, where two baby blobs of liver are encased in paper-thin slices of bettarazuke - sweet pickled daikon - an enlightened change from more familiar fruit. Sandwiching the blobs are wafer-thin potato chips that look exactly like pulled sugar sheets.\n\nThat bit of innovation gives way to staid grilled beef - either wagyu or gyuniku depending on the set - done very rare but with an accompanying hot stone to cook the meat further to your liking. A plain miso garnish and an odd piece of tofu covered with tartare-like sauce doesn't quite impress.\n\nNeither does the dessert of flourless chocolate cake which is more like hardened ganache, although the sesame custard sauce and brown sugar ice cream help mitigate it somewhat. We actually prefer the pre-dessert of sweet green tea syrup and slippery clear \"water\" jelly.\n\nEven if the food fails to spark the imagination or palate, we like Lewin Terrace for its earnestness and good intentions - from its well-meaning, if unsophisticated, service and Japanese sense of hospitality. It's unintimidating, the food's okay, and it's a really pretty place.\n\nIt reminds you of how restaurants used to be, even if it's a model that doesn't seem profitable.\n\nIf familiarity has gone out of style, let's hope Lewin Terrace can make it fashionable again.\n\nRating: 6.5\n\nWHAT OUR RATINGS MEAN\n\n10: The ultimate dining experience\n\n9-9.5: Sublime\n\n8-8.5: Excellent\n\n7-7.5: Good to very good\n\n6-6.5: Promising\n\n5-5.5: Average\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

What was somewhat unusual was the restraint shown by United Overseas Bank (UOB) - the combined pay of its two chairmen came to $1.68 million: two for less than the price of one as it did not even match what DBS Group's Peter Seah took home ($1.84 million).\n\nTucked away in OCBC's report was that the board would be losing its only woman director, Fang Ai Lian, who will not stand for re-election at the upcoming annual general meeting. OCBC then joins UOB in having only male directors.\n\nIn this day and age, it's a crying shame that two major Singapore corporations - they are the sixth and seventh largest listed companies here - have no female representation at its highest ranks. It is appalling that the gender glass ceiling exists here and these household names simply reinforce that view, though it may not be their intention.\n\nOnly 8.3 per cent of board directors at Singapore-listed companies are women, and 57 per cent of such companies have all-male boards, a recent study by the Diversity Task Force (DTF) to examine the state of gender diversity on boards and in senior management in Singapore found. The government-backed DTF was initiated in 2012 by then-minister of state for social and family development Halimah Yacob, who was concerned about the under-representation of women in these positions. The DTF found that not only are women under-represented on boards, but that most companies do not feel the need to increase this representation further.\n\nIt's strange that OCBC cannot find a suitable woman director when the group operates in some of the most heavily populated countries of the world. OCBC shows off its regional ambitions by the four cities on the annual report cover - Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and Shanghai.\n\nOf the three local banks, it is the most diversified institution with the broadest geographic footprint in Asia. The regional strategy has been bolstered by this month's acquisition of Wing Hang Bank. Wing Hang, the eighth largest bank in Hong Kong and sixth largest in Macau by total loans as at June 30, 2013, will help OCBC build a Greater China presence.\n\nIn Malaysia, the bank has a network that comprises 31 conventional branches and 10 Islamic banking branches. Through OCBC Al-Amin, OCBC is the only Singapore bank that operates a standalone Islamic bank while subsidiary Great Eastern Holdings is the largest insurance company by asset size with the biggest agency force in the country.\n\nOCBC's operations in Indonesia - which, with a population of 250 million, is not just South-east Asia's largest but also the fourth largest in the world - is nothing to sniff at. Bank OCBC NISP, the seventh largest privately owned bank in the country, has a network of 339 branches and offices which will help capture market share in one of the region's fastest growing economies (GDP 2013: 5.78 per cent). OCBC's non-Singapore loans make up more than half of group total, or 50.5 per cent. Total income from outside Singapore is 38 per cent of group, up from 37 per cent in 2012.\n\nMeanwhile, the tagline of DBS's annual report cover this year, \"Forging ahead in dynamic Asia\", sounds rather modest, perhaps reflecting the group's failure to expand meaningfully outside Singapore. Still, it is more easily understood than 2012's \"Present for the future\". Last August, DBS had to let the agreement to acquire a majority stake in Indonesia's Bank Danamon lapse, 16 months after the announcement of the transaction. Chief executive Piyush Gupta said candidly that the failed bid has pushed its ambitions to expand in that country back by five years.\n\nIncome contribution from the bank's key growth markets of China, Taiwan, India and Indonesia has increased, accounting for 14 per cent of group income, up from 11 per cent in 2009. In February 2010, at his first meeting with analysts, Mr Gupta laid out his roadmap for the bank, aiming for a revenue mix of 40:30:30 for Singapore, Greater China, South and South-east Asia in five years.\n\nNot long after that meeting, asked what he thought of his rival's roadmap, then UOB chairman Wee Cho Yaw said that he didn't think he needed one since he knows Singapore quite well. Singapore continues to be UOB's main focus. It's annual report cover is again a painting, a tradition of featuring art since 2009 for shareholders to enjoy.\n\nThis year's \"Gazing mountain\" by Tan Rui Rong was the winner of the silver award in the 2013 UOB Painting of the Year (Singapore) competition, now in its 32nd year. UOB chief executive Wee Ee Cheong began his shareholders' message with the painting which \"reminds us that the potential is always present before us, but to scale new heights, one must possess clear direction, resolve and resilience\".\n\nOne wonders if Mr Wee is worried about UOB's position as the largest mortgage provider among the local banks amid a sluggish property market and softening prices. Its housing loan book at the end of 2013 of $50.5 billion trumps those of DBS ($49.15 billion) and OCBC ($42.08 billion). Still, when it comes to operating in the region, UOB has made decent progress. Non-Singapore income contributes 44 per cent to the group, up from 42 per cent the year before.\n\nStill, the winner of the most regionalised bank title is ... drum roll ...

More expensive financing tightens credit and hence monetary conditions, Mr Varathan says.\n\nThis time round, policymakers face fewer trade-offs - the risks of higher inflation remain, while the growth outlook has improved.\n\nSingapore's headline inflation rate eased to a four-year low of 0.4 per cent in February - lower than 2013's inflation rate of 2.4 per cent. But this was largely due to the high base a year ago, skewed by a spike in COE premiums.\n\nAnd, MAS and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) have been warning in their monthly joint comments on prices, that higher wage costs are set to push the prices of services up more palpably, later this year.\n\nHeavier foreign worker levies and stricter quotas to wean companies off cheaper foreign labour have been accompanied by a tighter domestic labour market, Maybank's economists wrote in a note. Singapore's unemployment rate fell to 1.9 per cent last year, from 2 per cent in 2012 and 2011, they said.\n\nThe limited labour supply has pushed wages higher, and in coming months, the firms are expected to pass more of this swelling cost burden on to consumers in the form of pricier services. The government expects Singapore's core inflation, which strips out volatile housing and cars costs, to rise over the next few quarters as a result and come in at 2-3 per cent for this year, above last year's 1.7 per cent.\n\nThat is a forecast that Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Chua Hak Bin thinks the government will stick to, even if it does lower the headline inflation forecast range by half a percentage point, to 1.5-2.5 per cent.\n\nDomestic factors aside, Maybank's economists believe that imported inflation may \"rear its ugly head\" too, as global agricultural and commodity prices have crept higher due to weather changes. This is despite MAS and MTI's comments that imported inflation will remain subdued, as the global commodity market has ample supply buffer.\n\nEven if food prices stay stable, UOB economist Francis Tan has concerns that the strengthening US dollar over the past few months may mean higher prices for other imported goods.\n\nAlso boosting the case for monetary policy to remain tight is the fact that Singapore's growth outlook has improved since last October, reducing any need to weaken the Singapore dollar for the sake of export competitiveness.\n\nThe economy this year is a \"tale of two halves\" - export demand is strengthening, but domestic activity is slowing due to the cooling property market, says Barclays economist Leong Wai Ho. But most are of the view that improving manufacturing indicators in the US and Europe bode well for the export recovery, and ought to offset any drag the property market inflicts on the services sector.\n\nDr Chua thinks that there is in fact a good chance the government will upgrade its full-year GDP growth forecast to 2.5-4.5 per cent, from the current 2-4 per cent forecast range, when final Q1 GDP figures are released in May.\n\nMTI is due to announce a flash estimate of Q1 growth by next Monday. Economists are expecting year-on-year growth of 5.4 per cent, according to the median forecast of a Bloomberg poll.\n\nThe odds of MAS altering its policy stance in the other direction, towards a more aggressive appreciation of the Singapore dollar, are very slim, as there remain non-negligible risks, such as concerns over China's growth, says Bank of Singapore senior currency strategist Sim Moh Siong.\n\nBy most estimates, the S$NEER weakened to the mid-point of the undisclosed policy band early last month. But it has recently climbed higher - possibly driven by the unwinding of bearish China bets, Mr Sim says.\n\nBut the reversal could also be due to intervention from the central bank to prevent excessive weakening of the Singapore dollar, he thinks. Should this be the case, it would be \"an important signal of their intent to anchor inflation expectations\", Mr Sim adds.\n\nStandard Chartered economist Jeff Ng says that the MAS changed its policy stance more frequently during the 2007-2011 period, than during the 2001-2007 period, in line with the economic and financial markets turmoil in the US and Europe. \"Given that global conditions over the past two years have stabilised relative to before, we believe that the MAS will likely be more inclined to keep its stance on hold in April,\" he says.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It has been reported that Singapore has the highest incidence of per-capita peer-to-peer infringement of motion pictures out of the whole of Asia, and that half of all Internet users here access unlicensed sites.\n\nThe proposed changes to the law - which will be open to public feedback - will allow rights owners, or the exclusive licensees of the work, to directly apply for a court injunction to block off public access to the pirated material.\n\nFor example, if a company such as Sony finds that its copyrighted movies or music are being made available for public download here on a site such as The Pirate Bay, Sony can apply for an injunction with Singapore's High Court to prevent the public from accessing the movies or music on the piracy site here. It can also apply for an injunction to block access to the entire site, if it shows the infringement is extensive and widespread.\n\nThis is a departure from the current system, in which rights owners have to first issue a \"take-down\" notice to a network service provider (NSP) or Internet service provider (ISP), asking it to disable access to or remove copyright infringing material. Using the example above, it would mean that Sony would have to first send notices to an ISP such as StarHub, asking StarHub to prevent access to the material on its network.\n\nIf the ISPs do not respond, rights holders will then need to sue them for copyright infringement - which has not been a viable course for many - before they can seek an injunction.\n\nMinLaw believes that the proposed changes will make the whole process more efficient, as it will allow rights owners to tap the judicial system immediately and avoid implicating the ISPs unnecessarily.\n\nNotably, the proposed changes to the law are targeted at those who clearly and blatantly infringe copyright - such as Pirate Bay, and sites such as Torrentz - and not at search engines, such as Google or Yahoo, or websites based primarily on user-generated content, such as YouTube.\n\nThe proposed amendments to the statute also suggest that the court look at a non-exhaustive list of factors when deciding on the merits of an injunction application. These factors include: whether the online site's primary purpose is to commit or facilitate copyright infringement; whether the owner of the online site demonstrates a disregard for copyright; and whether access has been disabled by orders from courts in other countries.\n\nOnly rights holders or their exclusive licensees can apply for the injunction; site owners, ISPs or rights holders can also apply to the court to overturn an injunction. Applicants can also vary the original injunction if the original website has assumed a different IP address or URL.\n\nSuch an approach echoes the one adopted by the United Kingdom and member states of the European Union under The Copyright Directive, which harmonises aspects of copyright law across Europe.\n\nThe High Court in London, for example, issued orders in May 2012 requiring five ISPs to block their customers from accessing The Pirate Bay. It was estimated that traffic to the site dropped by some 70 per cent as a result.\n\nMinLaw said that it chose to follow the UK and European approach, rather than those adopted elsewhere in the world. Spain and Malaysia, for example, use an administrative site-blocking approach where rights holders can apply for site-blocking orders from a government-appointed body. France has introduced a \"graduated response\" system where individual Internet users are notified of their infringing activity by the ISP, and can be penalised if they continue despite repeated notifications.\n\n\"The government considered these possible alternative measures but decided against them because they are too intrusive on Internet users,\" MinLaw's statement said.\n\nThe proposed changes are the result of work done by the Media Convergence Review Panel, chaired by Koh Boon Hwee and appointed by the government in March 2012. The panel studied the issues impacting consumers, industry and society in the converged media environment and made its recommendations on how to deal with the challenges.\n\nThe public consultation paper on these changes is available on MinLaw's website (\n\nwww.minlaw.gov.sg\n\n). The public consultation closes on April 21.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is the first Singapore-designed device to win approval from the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\nFar fewer patients implanted with this balloon have developed post-surgery effects like dissection of artery walls compared to patients implanted with regular balloons, said the company's president and chief executive Eitan Konstantino.\n\nQT Vascular's next step is to produce a drug-coated Chocolate balloon, which can keep arteries unblocked for far longer than regular balloons.\n\nAnother of the company's devices, a version of the Chocolate balloon specially for blocked arteries in the heart, is now having its design verified, but has already earned the CE Marking and has thus been cleared for sale in Europe, said Dr Konstantino.\n\nA third product being developed is the \"Silk\" catheter, the metal parts of which have been replaced by high-strength fibres; this enables longer, larger catheters to be manufactured more cost-competitively.\n\nQT Vascular is working with UOB Kay Hian and Prime Partners for the IPO. The preliminary offer document was lodged last week.\n\nDr Konstantino, asked why he chose to list in Singapore, said: \"Singapore is our second home. It was natural for us.\"\n\nSingapore's business-friendly environment and \"visionary\" government were among factors contributing to the decision, he added. But one of the biggest draws was that Singapore could serve as a \"good bridge between the East and the West\".\n\n\"What we've seen in the past few years in the medical device industry is the shift to Asia ... Most multi-national companies, if not all of them, are making investments in Asia because they understand that their future goals (come) from this market.\"\n\nThe company counts multi-national pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson, the Economic Development Board's Biomedical Sciences Investment Fund, and homegrown Juniper Capital among its major shareholders.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Not a chance, even if you work for your entire life,\" the 50 year-old lamented as he drove past the glitzy front of MGM's metallic hued casino tower.\n\nPopulation growth in the tiny territory, one-third the size of Manhattan, is expected to jump 20 per cent to 700,000 people by 2016 according to government estimates. \"Four years ago you could buy a flat with one million patacas (S$158,000). Now you can't even buy a parking space,\" said Cherrie Choi, a sales director at realtor Centaline Property.\n\nSome residents are choosing to buy in Hong Kong where investment returns are twice that of Macau. Others are buying in neighbouring Chinese provinces and some, like many retirees, are giving up on the city and moving as far away as Thailand.\n\nLast month, more than 400,000 people competed for 1,900 affordable housing units with locals lining up outside Macau's public housing bureau at 4am, local media reported. \"It's really the biggest problem in Macau. Right now the rents and prices of flats have shot up way beyond people's financial capabilities,\" said lawmaker Jose Coutinho, who accuses the government of not doing enough to reverse the situation due to its ties with tycoon developers.\n\nProperty prices have more than tripled since 2009, according to data from the Macau government. The rise is in tandem with Macau's gaming revenues, which last year totalled US$45 billion, nearly three times greater than Las Vegas, Australia and Singapore combined.\n\nMacau's economy relies on the gaming industry with gaming taxes accounting for more than 80 per cent of government revenues.\n\nWith unemployment at 1.7 per cent, an estimated 40,000 new workers will be required as new properties open over the next three years, increasing demand for housing and exacerbating tension among protectionist labour unions worried about job security.\n\nMacau laws dictate only locals can work as dealers, and the government is under pressure from residents who regularly take to the streets to ensure these restrictions remain.\n\nAnalysts estimate new casinos opening in 2015-2017 will require 12,600 new dealers, yet only about 700 are available per year.\n\nA lack of a long-term plan for affordable housing is widening inequality, say lawmakers and property consultants, to such a degree that even well-paid foreign executives in the casino industry are finding Macau prohibitively expensive. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

He said he hasn't seen any indication that \"malfeasance\" or \"impaired mariners\" contributed to the accident.\n\nMatt Woodruff, director of government affairs for parent Kirby Corp, declined to comment on the recordings, radar data or the investigation, saying the company's only focus right now is on the clean-up.\n\nTranscripts of the recordings tell a tale of realisation that dawned too late.\n\nFog was beginning to clear, leaving visibility of about a mile, according to the recordings. Seven to 10 nautical miles is considered optimum visibility, or line of sight, according to George Fowler, another Vessel Traffic Service official. There's no speed limit through the channel, he said in a March 31 interview. Mr Nerheim said 12 knots is not unusual for a bulk carrier passing through the channel and barges being towed often travel at four or five knots.\n\n\"Alright, well s--, I'm glad I called you, man,\" a person that Mr Nerheim identified as the Miss Susan's watch officer said. The Miss Susan then asked the Summer Wind if it could slow down.\n\n\"Captain, I can cut it back,\" said the Summer Wind's pilot, who wasn't identified in the information obtained from a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and whom Mr Nerheim declined to name. \"I can put it down to a dead slow, but that still ain't gonna stop because I'm coming up on a half mile on you.\" Radar data shows the Summer Wind increased its speed to 12.4 knots.\n\nThe Miss Susan then attempted to make a hard turn to avoid a crash. As the two vessels inched closer, the Summer Wind suggested the Miss Susan hit reverse. \"You might want to stop and back it,\" the Summer Wind pilot said. \"I don't know what to tell you because, man, it's close.\"\n\nThe two vessels collided at about 12:35pm, causing the barge the Miss Susan was towing to spill fuel oil, restricting fishing in Galveston Bay and threatening bird sanctuaries at the start of the spring migration and nesting season.\n\nThe wreck occurred at the Texas City Y, where the Intracoastal Waterway and shipping lanes from Houston and Texas City all intersect with the channel to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe accident won't slow the US$35 billion in expansion projects along the waterway that will add oil refining capacity and create 265,800 jobs, said Michelle Hundley, spokeswoman for the Economic Alliance Houston Port Region.\n\nThe Ship Channel is home to the largest petrochemical complex in the US. On an average day last year there were 38 tankers, 22 freighters, one cruise ship, 345 tows, six public vessels, 297 ferries and 25 other transits, with 75 ships in port, Coast Guard data show.\n\nChannelview, Texas-based Kirby Inland Marine LP, the owner of Miss Susan, is responsible for the clean-up because its barge was the source of the oil that spilled.\n\nAt the time of the collision, Cleopatra, Summer Wind's operator, was on probation for a federal criminal pollution violation. It pleaded guilty in September 2012 to violating the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships and was ordered to pay a US$300,000 fine and serve a three-year probation term requiring implementation of an environmental compliance programme, according to federal prosecutors in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and court records filed in the case. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Of greater importance, however, is the consistency of a country's tax policy to investors - an area in which Singapore scored well.\n\nThese were some of the findings in Deloitte's 2014 Asia Pacific Tax Complexity Survey Report out yesterday.\n\nThe report, a follow-up to its inaugural 2010 report, looks at the key tax trends facing businesses operating in the region; it surveyed over 800 financial and tax professionals in 20 jurisdictions across the Asia-Pacific.\n\nAn overwhelming 85 per cent of respondents said that tax policy is a high priority for them when considering investing in the region.\n\nSixty-one (61) per cent said that corporate income tax is an extremely important issue, while 49 per cent believe that transfer pricing - which determines a significant portion of the taxable profits of companies in various jurisdictions - is also extremely important.\n\nOver 60 per cent said that the consistency, complexity and predictability of tax regimes across the region influences their decision-making process.\n\nConsistency refers to the perceived uniformity and transparency of the jurisdiction's enforcement of prevailing tax laws. Complexity means the perceived level of difficulty in interpreting and understanding the jurisdiction's tax law and regulations. And, predictability refers to the availability of information and resources that allow taxpayers to foresee the direction and potential changes in tax law.\n\nOf these three attributes of a tax system, 57 per cent of respondents said consistency was the most important factor to consider during the decision-making process.\n\nDeloitte noted the difference from its 2010 report, when complexity was rated as the most important issue. \"Now, consistency is crucial, perhaps indicating that Asia-Pacific tax practices are becoming more adept and experienced with dealing with complexity,\" its 2014 report said.\n\nSingapore scored highly in this area, with 93 per cent of all respondents rating the country as having a consistent or very consistent tax regime.\n\nSingapore also scored well in the other areas, with most respondents believing that its tax regime has a good or very high level of predictability and is amongst the least complex.\n\nIndia, mainland China and Indonesia were rated as the three most complex tax regimes.\n\n\"Tax regimes in the Asia Pacific have got increasingly more complex, bringing with it risk and uncertainty to businesses operating in the region,\" said Alan Tsoi, Deloitte's Asia Pacific regional managing director for tax and legal. \"With the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project set to bring sweeping changes to the tax landscape, I expect even greater complexity - but also opportunity - in the future.\"\n\nBase erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) refers to tax planning strategies that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules to make profits \"disappear\" for tax purposes, or to shift profits to locations where there is little or no real activity but the taxes are low resulting in little or no overall corporate tax being paid. The OECD, which has been tackling aggressive tax planning for years, has a 15-point action plan to address BEPS.\n\nLow Hwee Chua, tax services leader for Deloitte Singapore & South-east Asia, commented specifically on Singapore: \"Going forward . . . it would be increasingly challenging (for Singapore to ensure that its tax policies address both business and country needs), in view of the various BEPS initiatives that are expected to be introduced to address the issues of tax base erosion and to improve tax transparency. However, it is encouraging to see that survey respondents appear positive about Singapore and have indicated that Singapore's tax environment is unlikely to experience material change in the near term.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Formerly a hosting and colocation firm known as Savvis, it has changed its name to its parent's in January, having been acquired for US$2.5 billion by US telecoms firm CenturyLink in 2011.\n\nDavid Rosengrave, head of business development and product strategy for Asia-Pacific, said that the company is keen to court developers and is developing more \"shiny tools\" in the hopes of pulling techie types to CenturyLink's platform. Going on this route puts the company head-on with competitors such as Amazon Web Services and Rackspace, which arguably have built better relationships with the developer community.\n\n\"Big multinationals use public clouds like Amazon, and there are huge numbers of users which are doing projects on (those) clouds because it's easy. You can choose to wait for the company to give you a number of servers (for a project), or just use a credit card and jump on the public cloud straightaway.\n\n\"We want to get that piece of the pie,\" he said.\n\nTypically, the sales pitch doesn't go bottom-up from the IT department to those with reins over IT budgets, but Mr Rosengrave said that more companies are embarking on bigger projects on the cloud. CenturyLink hopes that playing well with a company's internal developer team will provide a gateway to bigger ticket hosting contracts with corporations.\n\nMr Rosengrave also acknowledged that the margins on smaller deployments are much lower compared with large corporate IT projects, but noted that small projects often get turned into serious deployments, and companies that are already on CenturyLink's platform are likely to stay on it. \"We want to provide the tools to turn development-stage projects into production,\" he said.\n\nThis aspiration fuelled the company's acquisitions of Tier 3 and AppFog last year. AppFog provided a platform layer for developers to execute code on, speeding up the time they would otherwise take to launch a Web app if they were doing it on their own servers. It reportedly had over 100,000 developers using it when it was acquired.\n\nTier 3 was a cloud infrastructure company, making technology to manage the underlying core of cloud data centres. Its technology now forms the basis of CenturyLink's infrastructure-as-a-service portfolio, and AppFog is a layer above that for developers. AppFog also allows an app to be moved between different clouds, so that projects which start out on public clouds can be moved to in-house servers easily - breaking down the barrier for companies to dip a toe in the public cloud, the company hopes.\n\nCenturyLink's financial backing allowed Savvis to acquire these companies, Mr Rosengrave added. \"We weren't known for being developer-friendly before. We hope customers will stick with us after they come onboard,\" he said. Once developers come onboard, the rest should be an easier sell to higher-ups in the company. Before its acquisition, Savvis was already one of the world's bigger hosting providers.\n\nToday, it has 55 data centres around the world, with a combined footprint of 2.4 million square feet of server space. In the Asia-Pacific, it has six data centres, or 170,000 square feet, employing 800. It has 200 staff in Singapore, where its regional headquarters is.\n\nGery Messer, CenturyLink's Asia-Pacific managing director, noted that there has been a downward trend towards in-house data centres, referring to those that are owned and managed by companies. Instead, more companies are going towards hybrid deployments, using a mix of their own servers and public third party clouds, so that they can benefit from the scale of the public providers.\n\nWhile CenturyLink tries to go the developer route, Savvis' bread and butter remains in colocation services, that is, allowing companies to house their servers within Savvis' premises, and charging for the managing of the equipment. With companies warming up to relying on third party providers, colocation is another service that the company expects will pick up in the coming years.\n\n\"It starts out with clients wanting to put their equipment in a secure facility. Then they ask for some managed hosting, because they're happy with your services. After that comes the cloud, where they try out putting some apps in the public cloud,\" he explained. With its new cloud acquisitions, Mr Messer said that CenturyLink is hoping to \"leapfrog\" its roots as a behind-the-scenes infrastructure provider, and \"move up the cloud\" with clients.\n\nAccording to Gartner figures, the public cloud services market grew 18.5 per cent last year to US$131 billion worldwide, up from US$111 billion in 2012. Infrastructure-as-a-service, which covers computing and storage services, was the fastest-growing segment, accelerating 47.3 per cent in 2013, faster than 2012's growth rate of 42.4 per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Corporates go to banks for swap transactions to hedge against sharp currency depreciations, to ensure steady cashflow from their overseas units.\n\nThe swap between the two currencies are settled in US dollars. Prior to yesterday, banks already enjoyed lower counterparty risks by clearing the swaps through SGX. But the transactions remained on their accounts.\n\nThis time, corporates can do the swaps through their own accounts with their brokers, instead of having to go through their banks. This allows banks to potentially use their capital more efficiently.\n\nSGX said customers are assured of direct access to transparent clearing services, greater operational efficiency and cost savings through its platform.\n\nMichael Syn, head of derivatives at SGX, said currency swaps in the ringgit and the baht are actively traded in Singapore and the region. \"SGX will continue to expand its Asia-based offerings and grow our pool of membership to provide customers with more options to manage their portfolios in Asia,\" he said.\n\nIn its press release, SGX cited DBS and Standard Chartered Bank as supporting the new initiative.\n\n\"The expansion of SGX's clearing service is beneficial to the industry especially in light of the increasing global over-the-counter derivatives regulatory reforms,\" said Valerian Crasto, DBS treasury and markets chief operating officer.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

On April 8, the US software colossus will stop patching newly found security holes in Windows XP code that hackers could exploit to slip into computers.\n\nDespite Microsoft's long-heralded plan to stop \"supporting\" the nearly 13-year-old operating system, it still powers from 20 to 30 per cent of Windows machines around the world, according to industry estimates.\n\n\"I am sure you have everything from police departments to banks to legal offices to restaurants,\" Trustwave director Christopher Pogue said while discussing the extent to which Windows XP is still used.\n\n\"Think of a business and they probably run XP; I would say everyone is in equal danger.\" US-based Trustwave specialises in helping businesses fight cyber crime.\n\nMicrosoft support entails regular security updates, but when it stops issuing patches to defend against freshly revealed hacker tactics aimed at XP, those using the operating system will need to enlist their own software wizards or live with mounting threats.\n\nHackers might already know of new ways to break into XP-powered computers but be waiting until after tomorrow to attack because Microsoft will no longer step in to thwart them, security experts say.\n\n\"You are talking literally millions of computers systems that will cease to receive regular security updates,\" Mr Pogue said. \"That is obviously causing a panic because of new vulnerabilities that will be introduced.\"\n\nMicrosoft has released several generations of Windows since XP made its debut in 2001.\n\nThe most recent version is Windows 8, tailored for a world enamoured of touch-screen computers and services hosted in the Internet \"cloud\". Given the rapid evolution of computer hardware and the short lifespans of devices, newer computers bought by consumers are likely running newer versions of Windows.\n\nOf concern, though, are small businesses that stuck with XP because they have grown accustomed to it and it gets the job done.\n\nSectors thought to be more prone to holding on to XP include those with relatively unsophisticated computing needs along with emerging markets or schools where money is tight.\n\nParticular worry is being expressed for automated teller machines, many of which are reported to rely on Windows XP.\n\nATMs could become vulnerable to hacking, particularly independent machines in small shops or bars that aren't owned by banks which are more likely to invest in software security, according to Gartner analyst Michael Silver.\n\n\"In a lot of cases, it is that Windows XP is good enough and people didn't see the business value to spending money to upgrade,\" Mr Silver said of businesses hanging on to XP as new versions of Windows came. \"It is a risky attitude, given what issues they could have. These folks knew this was coming, too.\"\n\nThe pain of \"migrating\" to new operating systems includes making sure software programs depended on by businesses will continue to work. Computers running Windows XP cannot easily be upgraded to the newest Windows version, and that means the users would need to buy new machines.\n\nWhile Microsoft stands to benefit through sales of new devices using Windows 8, organisations resigned to the aggravation of system changes could be open to considering what rivals such as Apple or Google have to offer.\n\n\"The risk for Microsoft is that people will migrate to somewhere else,\" said analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group. \"They should have never allowed it to get this bad.\" - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

Some even referred to the changes as \"massive revisions\" - not because the differentials were huge, but because the estimates and actual figures bounced in different directions.\n\nThe biggest surprise came from Q4's data - MTI had said in January that it expects the economy to contract by 2.7 per cent. But in February, this number was revised upwards by 8.8 percentage points, to a quarter-on-quarter annualised rate of 6.1 per cent growth.\n\nAnd while revisions to Q1 and Q3 data weren't as large in magnitude - upward adjustments of 3.2 percentage points and 2.3 percentage points respectively - the change in direction has been unsettling.\n\nThis is especially so when viewed historically: Over the last 10 years, MTI's quarter-on-quarter flash GDP estimates haven't been off the mark in directional terms - not even once.\n\nHow is it, then, that the government projected - incorrectly, as later data subsequently showed - sequential contractions for three out of four quarters last year?\n\nFirst, the nature of Singapore's small and open economy could be a factor. With total trade about 2.65 times GDP, the Republic is especially vulnerable to financial shocks in other countries, and would likely feel the impact more than larger, more domestically-driven economies.\n\nSecond, with Singapore's shift to more volatile growth sectors - such as the biomedical manufacturing cluster - accurate advance estimates could be increasingly difficult to hit, simply because of the country's growth profile. Because the early projection is based on data from the first two months of the quarter, if, for instance, production in the biomedical segment were to surge in the final month, the flash estimate could very well be blown out of the water.\n\nThird, some have theorised that Singapore's growing ties to China's economy could have an impact, especially when seasonal factors are in play. If manufacturing plants in China shut down, for example, Singapore's production cycle would be affected too - impacting economic growth here.\n\nBy April 14, MTI will release its flash estimates for Q1 GDP growth. The median forecasts of private-sector economists polled by Bloomberg stand at 5.4 per cent year-on-year, and an annualised 0.7 per cent quarter-on-quarter, after seasonal adjustments.\n\nWith so many unpredictable factors at play, there is no doubt that MTI's task is a difficult and tricky one. Some economists say that the government's data collection processes ought to be reviewed, to see if more accurate estimates can be garnered from the get-go.\n\nStill, regardless of the reasons behind them, the swings between projected figures and actual sequential growth numbers have led some to question whether flash estimates are even serving their purpose anymore.\n\nIf advance estimates were introduced to give investors, businesses and the public a heads-up on where the economy is heading - certainly a laudable and important endeavour - last year's reversals were misleading and confusing.\n\nAt least in theory, when negative headline advance estimates are released (by the Singapore government, no less), a knock-on effect on consumer and business behaviour can occur, impacting investment and spending decisions - only for this to have been for nought when the actual figure turns out positive.\n\nLooking at things with an optimist's lens, it's true that last year's news wasn't all bad: At least GDP growth kept surprising on the upside (and not the other way around), and the economy escaped landing in contractionary mode multiple times.\n\nBut it's also true that when government projections veer off into the opposite direction altogether - as they did in 2013, thrice - the quarter-on-quarter flash estimates start to lose their relevance. And with numbers so different from the final outcome, the credibility of advance GDP numbers will inevitably be called into question - defeating the purpose of having them in the first place.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Even the emergence of a political rock star such as Jakarta's reformist Governor Joko Widodo as a likely candidate for president in July and is expected to lead his Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) to a thumping victory this week, will do little to rekindle his interest.\n\n\"In the end they always compromise their ideals,\" Mr Said said. \"It's better to focus on my family.\"\n\nA wave of political apathy is sweeping the country just as a new class of lawmakers appears poised to take over. The popularity of Mr Widodo, better known here as \"Jokowi\", will likely help his PDI-P clinch as many as 45 per cent of seats in the House of Representatives, making it the ruling party for the first time in a decade, according to recent polls from Roy Morgan and the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nBut some specialists reckon that upwards of half of the electorate will stay home on election day, extending sharp declines in the voter participation rate since 2004 when the voter participation rate was 84 per cent. Audacious corruption scandals that reach up to the highest levels of the government have sapped public trust.\n\nThe Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) convicted in January the chairman of Mr Yudhoyono's ruling Democratic Party, Anas Urbaningrum, for his role in a multi-million dollar scandal to build a sports stadium in West Java. It also convicted the chairman of the Islamist Prosperous Justice Party, a member of the ruling coalition for a graft scandal centring on kickbacks for doling beef import quotas. Last year, the KPK arrested Akil Mochtar, chief justice of the constitutional court, for accepting bribes to sway the outcome of a disputed mayoral election.\n\nSensing the frustration, the KPK launched its first public education initiative. Its \"Chose Honesty\" campaign took to social media and billboards to encourage the electorate to get out and vote, if only to elect a less crooked bunch of lawmakers.\n\n\"People don't want to vote, they're tired,\" said KPK deputy chairman Adnan Praja.\n\n\"We're trying to tell them that it's up to them to chose better politicians.\"\n\nThose scandals will likely cost Mr Yudhoyono's Democrats dearly this year, with some opinion polls saying that they may see their support gutted from about 20 per cent in 2009 when it took the lion's share of the seats in the country's lower house to between 5 per cent and 10 per cent.\n\nOfficial results of the election are due in early May. Parties or coalitions that gain at least 20 per cent of the seats in the House of Representatives or 25 per cent of the national vote are permitted to nominate candidates for president at the presidential poll on July 9. A run-off is slated for September if no candidate wins at least 50 per cent of the vote.\n\nOpinion polls suggest Mr Widodo is the favourite to take over from Mr Yudhoyono following the inauguration slated for October.\n\nApart from the corruption, missed opportunities for reform have played a role in the public's apathy towards politics, said Yuli Ismartono, deputy chief editor of Tempo Magazine's English language edition. Ms Ismartono said that after 10 years, Mr Yudhoyono's Democrats could have done more to wean the country off subsidised fuel and put the estimated US$22 billion it spends annually on the benefit to more productive use.\n\n\"This is the end of a regime. The people are disappointed,\" Ms Ismartono said.\n\n\"We're looking at the two terms the Democrats had thinking 'that was not what we expected'.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Five are in Beijing, and the Reit has one mall each in the cities of Shanghai, Wuhan, Wuhu, Zhengzhou and Huhhot.\n\nThe biggest and most profitable mall is CapitaMall Xizhimen, located at a transportation hub in Beijing. About 35 million shoppers passed through it last year - about the same as those passing through Raffles City, for a comparison.\n\nCRCT's second most profitable mall by net property income is CapitaMall Wangjing in Beijing's Chaoyang district. Just over 10 million shoppers passed through it last year, putting its traffic on par with Rivervale Mall in Sengkang.\n\nBut it generated $26 million of net property income in 2013 compared with Xizhimen's $33 million. This is probably due to how the mall is located in a major residential area. Interestingly, Wangjing is even more profitable on a per-shopper basis than the suburban cash cows of Causeway Point and Tampines Mall in Singapore.\n\nCRCT's latest acquisition from sponsor CapitaMalls Asia is Beijing's Grand Canyon mall. CMA bought the mall last July and CRCT exercised its option to buy it last November, with the deal completed at end-2013. The mall begins contributing its income to CRCT this year. The mall is located along the South Third Ring West Road in Beijing's Fengtai district. CRCT calls it \"one of the pioneer shopping malls in South Beijing\".\n\nA notable feature that CRCT has, introduced last year, is its distribution reinvestment plan. This allows investors to receive their distributions in new units instead of cash. Units are typically allocated at a very slight discount to market prices, and the investor typically saves on the commissions that would otherwise be incurred to buy the extra units.\n\nOther Reits that have similar plans include AIMS AMP Capital Industrial Reit, Cambridge Industrial Trust, Mapletree Commercial Trust and First Reit. Distribution reinvestment plans allow the Reit to conserve cash. Investors typically put money in Reits to get an income, though. They would subscribe for the plan if they are planning to increase their allocation to the Reit anyway, or believe the value of their units will go up.\n\nCompared to the other overseas retail Reits, CRCT has the highest interest coverage ratio for most of last year, according to OCBC Investment Research. This means it generates the most income relative to its interest payments.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

At the time, two of them, The Metropolis and Ma On Shan Plaza, contributed about 75 per cent of the Reit's total revenue.\n\nSince then, the Reit has diversified its asset base. In 2005, it raised equity and new debt and acquired another six malls, nearly doubling the value of its assets. It bought another three in 2009, two in 2012 and one last year. Today, it has a total of 17 properties valued at HK$29.3 billion.\n\nThe top contributor to revenue and net property income for 2013 is Fortune City One, the mall serving City One Shatin, a 52-block residential development in Hong Kong's New Territories by the Shing Mun River. City One contributes more than 22 per cent of Fortune Reit's total revenue - more than the Reit's lowest-contributing 10 properties combined.\n\nOther major contributors to revenue are Ma On Shan Plaza (18 per cent) also in the Sha Tin area, Metro Town (10 per cent) beside the Tiu Keng Leng MTR interchange station, and Fortune Metropolis (10 per cent) in South Kowloon opposite Hong Kong Island.\n\nA significant boost occurred last October, when Fortune Reit acquired the Kingswood Ginza mall from sponsor Cheung Kong for HK$5.7 billion. The mall is the largest shopping centre in the Yuen Long district and beside the massive 58-block Kingswood residential development at Tin Shui Wai. Analysts were positive on the acquisition, noting earnings for the Reit will get a lift from increased occupancy and future asset enhancement activities.\n\nWith the acquisition, funded by mostly debt and some equity, Fortune Reit's gearing is now at around 33 per cent - close to the 35 per cent limit for Reits without a credit rating. Management has said in the past it is looking at obtaining a rating, which would bump the Reit's gearing limit to 45 per cent under Hong Kong Reit rules.\n\nHong Kong headwinds\n\nThe Hong Kong real estate sector, however, has been facing headwinds. Banks such as Barclays, Bank of America and UBS all forecast a property slump by end-2015 as supply rises while income growth remains limited. The threat of rising interest rates has also dampened sentiment.\n\nOn the retail side, prime shopping street rents have doubled since 2009, but cooled noticeably in recent months, notably in Causeway Bay. Rents at Central and Tsim Sha Tsui have also been moderating.\n\nShopper flow, driven by mainland Chinese visitors, is expected to prop up the sector. A Savills report in February said shopping centre rents are projected to increase 5 to 10 per cent this year, though rental declines are happening in less prime areas.\n\n\"While first-tier locations, which have proven popular among mainlanders, will continue to see strong demand and sustained rental levels, more vacancy and steeper rental adjustments might be recorded in secondary and tertiary locations,\" it noted.\n\nBut it added that \"same-day visitors will outnumber overnights again in 2014 and this will continue to benefit centres in the New Territories and sales of convenience goods\".\n\nThis suburban retail story remains resilient, with growth limited by infrastructure constraints, Savills said. Similarly, a JP Morgan report on Jan 29 said that \"decentralised shopping malls are as packed as in prime areas\".\n\nThere are more visitors on day trips from the Chinese border, implying that malls in the New Territories such as Tuen Mun, Sheung Shui and Sha Tin would benefit, it said.\n\n\"Other than luxury international brands like Chanel and Louis Vuitton, mass to mid-end brands have a presence in Tuen Mun like Zara, Uniqlo, Lancome, implying the spending power in the decentralised districts,\" it said.\n\nJP Morgan was overweight on Fortune Reit (target price HK$7.90) as well as Link Reit (target price HK$44.80). Link Reit, a suburban mall play, is Hong Kong's first Reit and Asia's largest Reit.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its core business comprises the sales, marketing and distribution of a wide portfolio of international beverages, including Pravda and Heavy Water vodkas, Zonin wines, and various specialty Japanese soft drinks.\n\nCarlsberg's portfolio of international alcoholic drinks include Nikka whisky, Gekkeikan sake, Lanson champagne and Hooper's Hooch.\n\n\"MayBev is a company we have long admired for their excellent stewardship of Asahi as it has grown to become Singapore's second-biggest premium lager.

This will come from expansion plans in many of our key markets as well as new market penetration. Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines are big markets for us, and the new store openings this quarter show our commitment in bringing the TWG Tea experience to all our customers around the world.\"\n\nTWG added four new locations in Malaysia and one in the Philippines.

The stock then surged to an intra-day high of 52.5 cents before ending at 51.5 cents, up 36.5 cents or 143 per cent. More than four million shares changed hands for the day.\n\nThe proposed transactions announced late last Friday also prompted at least one analyst to recommend that investors \"add\" Ezion \"as more contract wins should catalyse its share price\". Shares in mainboard-listed Ezion closed trading yesterday down three cents at $2.11.\n\nJK Tech said that it intends to diversify into oil and gas exploration by issuing 42 million shares to Ezion at nine cents each, a 40 per cent discount to the volume weighted average price of 15 cents for trades done on April 1.\n\nAs payment, Ezion will issue about 1.85 million new Ezion shares at $2.0445 per share, a 5 per cent discount to the volume weighted average price for trades done on April 4. This represents about 0.15 per cent of the total enlarged issued share capital of Ezion.\n\nCIMB analyst Yeo Zhi Bin told BT: \"We haven't spoken to (Ezion) management about the purpose behind this, and its announcement was fairly vague. But we believe the deal is another attempt by Ezion to separate its Australian marine supply base business into another vehicle.\"\n\nEarlier in February, Ezion had announced that it had terminated its bid to acquire a 45.15 per cent stake in mainboard-listed Ocean Sky.\n\nThe failed bid involved a reverse takeover plan by Ezion, which wanted to inject its marine supply base business in Australia, Ezion Offshore Logistics Hub, into Ocean Sky.\n\nOSK-DMG analyst Jason Saw told BT: \"It is clear that any new business outside the core liftboat and service rig business will be parked under a separate entity so as not to burden Ezion's balance sheet. This will help to ring-fence any risk from other businesses that may impact Ezion and allow the new vehicle to raise funding separately. (Ezion) shareholders should not be concerned given (the) small quantum of investment.\"\n\nIn its Friday announcement, JK Tech also said that it will issue 13 million shares to investment company SF Ventures (SFV) at 13.5 cents each as well as privately place out 20 million shares at the same price. The net cash from these two exercises of $4.2 million - and another $29.25 million if all the options are exercised - will be used to fund its diversification. Ezion was introduced to JK Tech by SFV.\n\nOnce the SFV and private placement shares are issued, Ezion's 42 million shares will amount to 29.81 per cent of JK Tech, just shy of the 30 per cent takeover trigger.\n\nHowever, JK Tech is also proposing to issue 260 million share options to Ezion with a conversion price of nine cents per option, and 65 million options to SFV with the same conversion price.\n\nIf all these options are fully exercised, Ezion will end up owning 64.82 per cent of JK Tech's enlarged share capital.\n\nJK Tech managing director Eugene Ang, who has an interest of 81.33 per cent, may see his eventual stake diluted to as low as 11.51 per cent. JK Tech said that he would undertake to vote in favour of the proposed diversification.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They last traded at 15 cents; meanwhile, Ezion's shares fell three cents on Friday to $2.14 with 4.6 million done.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This week is the beginning of what the financial world has been waiting for: earnings season. On aggregate, Wall Street analysts estimate first-quarter earnings for the Standard & Poor's 500 will grow by a mere 1.1 per cent from last year's levels - a \"very low threshold\", said Prudential's Ms Krosby.\n\nIf corporations can top those modest expectations, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average could finally break through the 1,900 and 17,000 marks they first approached in December.\n\n\"This is a market trying to ascertain are these valuations commensurate with underlying growth . . . (it's) waiting for earnings season,\" said Ms Krosby.\n\nEarnings season begins officially tomorrow, when aluminium processor Alcoa is expected to report a modest increase in earnings. Shares of Alcoa and other metals processors have rebounded somewhat after a long slide as some traders and analysts bet China will soon invest in economic stimulus again, thus benefiting the commodities sector.\n\nIn a note entitled \"Don't count out commodities just yet\", analysts at brokerage BMO Capital said many dire Wall Street predictions for the prices of metals and other raw materials were overstated.\n\n\"Something funny happened on the way to the commodity cataclysm - broad measures of commodities are actually up so far this year, and up from year-ago levels,\" the BMO analysts said.\n\nIn a world where there always seems to be a \"crisis du jour\", an investor must learn to distinguish between \"news\" and \"noise\", said J D Joyce, author of The Story of Rich, an investment fable.\n\n\"If news is more about earnings and (what) someone's willing to pay for those earnings then what is noise? And to me noise is almost everything else,\" said Mr Joyce.\n\n\"Things that may seem really important today may have little to no impact, long term, on a portfolio. Sometimes it could be a short-term geopolitical event; it could be various economic stats . . . When there's data being released or an exogenous event that has nothing to do with earnings, there's a knee jerk reaction - almost in panic mode - that causes someone to depart from a long-term plan.\"\n\nLast week, there was a lot of noise, some of which may eventually turn out to be news.\n\nAuthor Michael Lewis set off one of the most bitter and profound debates in financial circles in a generation when he launched his book Flash Boys. The book alleges the hedge funds and trading firms known as high-frequency traders have deliberately \"rigged\" the electronic stock market to their advantage.\n\nLewis and others are calling for wide reforms. Their opponents, some of whom are in the business of high-speed electronic trading, claim this activity makes it easier and cheaper to buy and sell stock and that any reforms could backfire.\n\nIn addition to earnings season, traders will pay close attention to the minutes of the March Federal Reserve meeting this week. Janet Yellen jarred markets when she seemed to suggest that the central bank could hike rates in 2015.\n\nDetails of the first policy debate Ms Yellen chaired could calm investors' nerves, said Ms Krosby. More likely, however, is that the nerves will persist. Part of the trouble for the S&P 500 and the Dow is \"technical\".\n\n\"The record highs first reached in December have become psychological blocks. The indexes have fallen back so many times from the levels they hit once again last week that traders are reluctant to buy there,\" she said.\n\n\"Any time you go through a new level, the market tends to get nervous (and say) 'do we really mean this'?\"\n\n\"This is what happens when you push through new technical levels: you wait for confirmation, and that confirmation comes from earnings.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The crisis forced the US government to issue vast amounts of public debt - publicly-traded US government debt rose 5.8 times compared to the pre-crisis period. The US Federal Reserve also injected massive liquidity into the markets via three rounds of quantitative easing, the last of which is still in progress.\n\nA number of commentators expected that with the supply of dollars having thus dramatically increased, the dollar would go down. But this didn't happen: in trade-weighted terms, the dollar is at about the same level as it was before the GFC.\n\nInvestors, as well as foreign central banks, sought safety in the dollar. Foreign central banks bought about 60 per cent of the US public debt issued after the GFC. \"The irony was that people went into the US dollar for safety, even though the US was the main source of the global financial crisis,\" said Dr Prasad.\n\nSomething similar happened when the US was on the verge of a technical default on its public debt, as a result of the inability of the US Congress to agree on a debt ceiling in 2011 and again in 2013. The response of investors was to increase their dollar holdings. \"Every time the US came close to defaulting, US bond yields fell,\" Dr Prasad pointed out.\n\nThe main reason for the dollar's increased attractiveness after the GFC was essentially a skyrocketing of demand for safe assets both from private investors and foreign central banks, who wanted to hold large amounts of reserves.\n\nCommercial banks, which were badly bruised during the crisis, were also required to hold more safe assets.\n\nMoreover, in the post-GFC world, the dollar faced less competition from other currencies that were traditionally safe havens in the past. Dr Prasad pointed out that both Switzerland and Japan discouraged large capital inflows, which would have strengthened their currencies, something they did not want. By intervening in the markets, they ended up adding to the demand for dollars.\n\nThe euro was not favoured either, because of the eurozone crisis and the fact that euro-denominated financial markets were not as deep and liquid as dollar markets.\n\nHowever, Dr Prasad noted that the euro could yet pose more competition to the dollar if the eurozone were to achieve full economic and political union, including a fiscal and banking union - but that is still far off.\n\nWhat about the renminbi? Could it challenge the dollar, as a reserve currency and a safe haven?\n\nChina's currency has a lot going for it, according to Dr Prasad, who previously served as head of the International Monetary Fund's China Division.\n\nHe pointed out that the Chinese economy is still growing rapidly and may become as large as the US economy within the next decade.\n\nThe renminbi is also gaining traction as a trade currency; many countries in Asia, Latin America and Africa already hold some of their reserves in renminbi because \"it's a low-cost bet on a currency that is going to become more prominent\", and these countries have strong trading links with China. Twenty one central banks have signed local currency swap deals with the People's Bank of China. The renminbi may therefore gain ground as a reserve currency. But a reserve currency is different from a safe-haven currency, he explained.\n\nWhat safe-haven currencies (which in the past have also included the euro, the yen, and the Swiss franc) have in common are open and transparent systems of government; public institutions, including central banks, that command trust; and independent legal frameworks in which even the government is held to account.\n\nChina does not, as yet, have these characteristics, said Dr Prasad. \"The US has the magic sauce that will keep the dollar as the dominant reserve and safe-haven currency for a long time to come,\" he added. \"The renminbi will erode, but not challenge, the dollar's dominance.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/making-utilities-pillar-sembcorp", "site_title": "Making utilities a pillar in Sembcorp", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nMaking utilities a pillar in Sembcorp\n\nSembcorp Industries' CEO Tang Kin Fei has played an instrumental role over the past 2 decades. By LEE MEIXIAN\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Apr 6, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSOME 20 years ago, Sembcorp Industries, a heavyweight in Singapore's utilities sector and a blue-chip conglomerate, didn't actually have a utilities business. Today, utilities, comprising energy, water, solid waste management and on-site logistics, contributed $450 million in 2013 net profit - more than half the $820 million total net profit reported that year.\n\nMoreover, profit from utilities is expected to double in the next five years, on the back of a strong development pipeline of power and water projects in mostly rapidly developing economies.\n\nOne person who was instrumental in adding the utilities pillar to the company's then largely marine operations back in 1995 is Sembcorp's present-day group president and CEO Tang Kin Fei.\n\nThe utilities business arose because of a conundrum that Mr Tang found himself grappling with back when he was heading Sempec, a seven-person unit of Sembawang Engineering engaged in onshore plant engineering services.\n\nMr Tang found himself starting from a zero base each year and having to secure contracts from scratch to replace what had been delivered before the unit could grow.\n\nMeanwhile, margins were also becoming increasingly competitive, so he decided the company needed \"another wing of substantial income\", something more stable and recurring. At the time, customers on Jurong Island for whom his unit was developing plants were sharing their infrastructure grievances with him, so he hit upon a solution - to outsource their utilities requirements to SembCorp to manage at a competitive price.\n\n\"That's how I formed Sembcorp Utilities at the time. On the one hand, I was looking for recurring income; on the other hand, I was solving my customers' problems. The two together form what is Utilities today,\" he said.\n\nToday, the company develops, owns and operates energy and water assets in 50 locations in 15 countries globally, with a particular focus on emerging markets.\n\nExpansion has become crucial as competition intensifies in Singapore. New power plants and LNG terminals have ramped up electricity supply well past demand levels and are putting pressure on Singapore's electricity prices.\n\nMr Tang said that Singapore's current power usage is about 5,500MW (megawatts) per day, growing at 3 per cent, or 150 to 200MW, annually - a far cry from the growth of 400 to 500MW a year in the old days.\n\n\"Today, the overhang (or excess) in our power supply is about 2,500MW. To tackle the overhang, you need quite many years. It will take a bit of time for the surplus power to be absorbed into the system.\"\n\nThis affected Sembcorp's financial performance in its latest fiscal year. Lower electricity sales and weaker prices here shaved 14 per cent off Singapore's slice of the utilities earnings pie to $226 million. While Singapore remains the largest contributor, overseas operations now account for more than half of its utilities profits, and will continue to grow to a proportion of more than 70 per cent, Mr Tang said.\n\nIn expanding overseas, Sembcorp's strategy is to focus within a \"nine to 10-hour flight zone\", covering mainly Asean, China, India and the Middle East - what Mr Tang terms the \"low hanging fruits that (Sembcorp) should get first\".\n\nIt is a rule of thumb that a country's utility demand generally correlates with its GDP growth, he explained. Take Singapore's 2-4 per cent GDP growth for instance; as its economy moves away from heavy manufacturing to services and more high-tech industries, its utility demand has also fallen in tandem.\n\nThe reverse is true for the developing Asian giants, China and India. \"China is growing at 7 per cent, India at about 4-6 per cent, but hopefully after its elections this year, it will go back to 7-8 per cent growth,\" he said.\n\n\"In these countries, as their economies grow, consumption of power and water also go up with the development of more commercial, office, shopping and residential space. When demand goes up and supply stays the same, prices go up too.\"\n\nSembcorp plans to take advantage of the new Chinese administration's emphasis on the environment and resource management, particularly in the water sector. Between now and 2016, it will be completing four industrial water treatment plants, as well as expanding capacity at an existing water plant in various provinces of China.\n\nIn India, where power outages and electricity rationing are commonplace, two coal-fired 1,320MW power plants will be ready by 2016 to tackle the nation's huge power deficit.\n\nSembcorp, which entered India about four years ago, can be considered among the first movers of foreign energy entrants into the Indian market, soon after the country formally set up its energy exchange, Mr Tang said.\n\nThe company is refining its utilities developer model from its once conservative stance of taking minority equity stakes in overseas joint ventures (\"so that the debt doesn't hit our balance sheet\"), to one where it takes a larger stake with the option to sell down upon the completion of the project, or the start of its commercial operations.\n\nSembcorp executed this strategy last year when it pared down its stake in its Oman joint venture, Sembcorp Salalah, and listed it on the Muscat Securities Market. The listing also helped the group reap an exceptional one-time gain of $117 million.\n\nIt may now consider doing the same with its India power business when it has garnered enough scale. \"We can't IPO (initially public offer) a company with one or two plants; we need substantial base income, with a pipeline identified, so as to maximise gains and attract higher valuations,\" he said.\n\nWhy the strategy shift?\n\nMr Tang said: \"I thought by adopting our previous conservative practice, we were shooting ourselves in the foot, because Sembcorp's capability is in developing plants, from greenfield to operations.\n\n\"Why do we give away all this value to third parties and invite others on a free ride; why don't we develop a bolder approach which can also enhance our shareholders' value? At the same time, we also meet our objective of not carrying the debt on our balance sheet.\"\n\nA second reason is sustainability: \"It is impossible for us to continue injecting money into another country to grow our business. Over the longer term, we need to have a structure in India that's self-sustaining. The Indian unit must be able to generate enough income to plough back into future investments to grow the business.\"\n\nThe way to do it is by listing the Indian unit eventually. This will make it a \"win-win for everybody\"; the business can grow and so can income for shareholders, he said.\n\nleemx@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Yet, its success depends on keeping the state sweet. From e-commerce to online finance, the Internet giant's senior executives argue its strategy is in line with government policy. While that can at times make them sound like bureaucrats, it's a reminder that official support is a key asset for China's technology giants.\n\nOver the past decade, Alibaba has led a shopping revolution in China with its online marketplaces. Now, it is stirring up the financial sector by offering online payment services and wealth management products. In just eight months, its Yu'e Bao money market fund has attracted assets greater than the deposits of China's five smallest listed banks.\n\nAlibaba's private status has allowed it to quickly exploit new opportunities. But, as it goes head to head with entrenched interests such as China's large state-owned banks, Alibaba is making an effort to emphasise the broader benefits of its business. E-commerce helps sustain small businesses and create jobs, while its push into online finance is helping to liberalise China's interest rates. Those measures, executives say, are consistent with the larger policy objectives of China's senior leadership.\n\nSuch soothing words may help protect Alibaba and rivals such as Baidu and Tencent from government intervention at a time when opponents are pushing back. Earlier this year, Beijing and Shanghai restricted the use of mobile apps that allow travellers to summon taxis on their phones. Meanwhile, financial regulators are taking steps to tame online finance.\n\nWestern internet giants such as Amazon, Google and Facebook also face increased government scrutiny as they grow larger. But in China it's even more important for Internet companies to keep on the right side of the ruling Communist party. The state not only owns the giant banks they are increasingly competing against, but also turns a blind eye to the semi-legal \"variable interest entity\" structures that they use to list their shares abroad.\n\nAlibaba's rise owes much to its private status. But the state still has a big say in its continued success.

For example, Ixia's test solutions are used to verify that converged IP networks operate reliably and are secure from threats.\n\nMr Bhat talked about the emergence of cybersecurity professions as a response to the increasing prevalence and severity of cyberattacks.\n\nJust as how jobs in website design and application development were the result of industry trends, a new wave of cybersecurity professions will take off as companies realise that \"the enormity of cybercrime has far surpassed the ability of organisations to deal with them\".\n\n\"Till 9/11, airport security was important but not that important. After 9/11 the whole airport security business just ballooned. Similarly, this is the time that you see a large number of cybercrimes. The Bank of Muscat was a big one, Target is the biggest one now . . . All it takes is a few more of these incidents to happen then consumers will be asking their organisations: Do you have more security? A more secure organisation would mean more business than a less secure organisation.\"\n\nBank Muscat was hit last year when 12 pre-paid travel cards were compromised and US retailing giant Target had credit card data of its customers stolen.\n\nThe rise in cybercrime can be attributed in part to the proliferation of technological devices that create many vulnerable entry points into a company's and even personal cyber structures, as well as the lucrativeness of these criminal activities. Distributional denial of service, online fraudulent activities and data leakages were amongst the specific problems organisations face today, said Mr Bhat.\n\nSingapore is taking a leading position in establishing a very secure network, according to Lieu Chin Chuan, course chair for Singapore Polytechnic's Diploma in Infocomm Security Management. SP's Cyber Security Academy, a first in the region, is an example of such leadership. He said the cyber security course is able to provide the most realistic environment to train and prepare for future cyberattacks in Singapore.\n\nFor example, along with using Ixia's BreakingPoint Storm system to simulate real-life enterprise networks and generate real-life hacking scenarios, the Cyber Security Academy also imparts important soft skills such as effective communication and the ability to learn into its students.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By May Yip\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 4, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nFOR some, the height of luxury involves multiple consultations with a tailor, deciding on details such as a classic peak versus a notch lapel on a suit jacket, before waiting eight to 10 weeks for that perfectly fitted, handcrafted garment. But as much as fashion is witnessing a return to su misura services, there is brisk business to be made in the realm of instant gratification and convenience. Enter e-retailers hawking easy-to-navigate interfaces, myriad choices and often wallet-friendly prices, to men who want to look dashing without the hassle.\n\nSingapore-born Heikal Gani is one of the first to have spotted the potential for a convenient and affordable suit shopping experience. As a student at Canada's University of Victoria, Mr Gani developed a business plan with best pal Kyle Vucko for an online menswear business in 2007. Rather than selling designs by existing clothing brands, they offered made-to-order suits with just a few clicks. To date, the Canadian-based company Indochino (\n\nwww.Indochino.com\n\n) has suited 120,000 men in 130 countries, and raised over $14.8 million in a series B round of financing to grow the business last year.\n\n\"Most guys appreciate the convenience of shopping online, and with our process you can buy faster than driving to your nearest store,\" says Mr Gani, who graduated with a double major in psychology and political science.\n\n\"The biggest evolution in the market since we've started has been the number of options for guys who want to shop online. This is a good thing, because guys today care a lot more about how they dress and want more options when it comes to clothing choices, fit and style.\"\n\nSince the pioneer in menswear tailoring has gone live seven years ago, several new players have emerged on the market, including the newest kid on the block, homegrown company Tailor Me Online (\n\nwww.TMO.sg\n\n). Entrepreneur Ken Yuen and civil engineering graduate Marcus Lio recently launched the e-commerce business retailing customisable shirts, suits and even shoes. Made-to-measure shirts are constructed in just two weeks.\n\n\"We want customers to enjoy the best of both worlds - old-world tradition of haberdashery and convenience through online customisation,\" explains Mr Yuen, who started the online portal in 2013, two years after launching the bespoke tailoring business. \"We want to make custom (clothing) accessible to men around the world. Men are working longer hours. They deserve to wear better custom clothing instead of mass-produced, mannequin-sized garments.\"\n\nApplying his technical background to the business, Mr Lio developed a \"scientific method\" of measurement, taking into account one's skeletal structure to calculate a fit that is 80 per cent accurate. But while picking out a well-fitted shirt online is fairly easy, the duo advise customers to visit their showroom for more accurate measurements. Customers' profiles are then stored online for future purchases.\n\nHigh thread counts\n\nAnd it isn't just male entrepreneurs who are joining the virtual tailoring fray. Sherrey Chng-Bahuguna started her online shirt boutique ButtonNStitch.com in 2012, selling designs made from fabrics with high thread counts and two-ply, pure cotton.\n\n\"Being an avid online shopper and personal stylist for my husband, it bothers me to spot a good-looking guy in a 'structure-less' shirt with frayed collars, loose threads or even mismatched patterns on a shoulder yoke,\" says the mother of two. \"Men are generally not into fast fashion or what we consider 'wear and throw' fashion, but shirts with good quality and cut usually come with prices that create a dent in the pocket.\"\n\nThe businesswoman, who reveals that 75 per cent of her clientele are repeat customers, unveiled her first brick-and-mortar space on Thursday - a pop-up store set up at Tangs Vivocity where customers can try on the brand's designs till April 16.\n\nAnd she isn't the only e-retailer to offer consultations in the flesh. Indochino holds a series of \"Traveling Tailor\" events in Canada for men to meet with a stylist, feel the fabrics and talk through their customisation options.\n\n\"We started online, but when we realised there were men who wanted to shop in person, we took what we had learnt to launch Traveling Tailor,\" explains Mr Gani. \"It's the same measurement and customisation process online and offline, and an equally beautiful and convenient experience. As a business, we also benefit from the chance to meet our customers in person and learn more about what they're looking for when they shop.\"\n\nApart from businesses targeting corporate types who live in pin-stripes and sombre suits, entrepreneurs Gad Tan and Zin Cattell, who are trained in web and fashion design respectively, created Menswearmenswear.com for more sartorially adventurous men.\n\nEstablished last year, the duo specialise in pieces with eye-catching fabrics and witty details. It also breaks the mould of online stores featuring a whole slew of designs and customisable options. Instead, it offers just one style this season - an unstructured, single-breasted sports jacket, available in seven fabric options and customisable sleeve lengths and sizes. It comes with straps to allow the wearer to tote it, rucksack-style, when the weather gets too warm.\n\n\"We do with a carefully curated selection each season (four seasons per year, and all designs limited to 100 pieces each) instead of masses of choices and styles that confuse and turn off the shopper,\" elaborates Mr Cattell, who targets male shoppers who usually buy higher-end high street togs.\n\nBut while the online platform is a godsend for time-strapped men, nothing quite replaces the experience of a one-on-one consultation with a tailor.\n\n\"As fashion advisers, we guide our clients throughout the whole process from the foundation till the actual canvas is crafted,\" adds Mr Yuen. \"At every step of the way, we are here to help our clients through the process of creating their ideal suit - selecting the most prominent aspects of creating the perfect suit; also solving dilemmas such as choice of fabric, colour, style, cut and design.\"\n\nAnd if leaving your desk is too much trouble, there's always a consultation via webcam.

On average, digital spending makes up about 2.5 per cent of company revenue, said the analyst firm.\n\nIn speaking of changing this, Mr Rezab said that some of Socialbakers' bigger clients such as Nestle have been using social media data to compare their effectiveness in reaching audiences in real-time, and they are concerned with benchmarking themselves across the industry.\n\nBecause of how instant audience feedback can be online, in little snippets over Twitter or Facebook for instance, brands can use the data to find out the impact of an event on their operations, or how well their customer service responded to users.\n\nSocialbakers is a Prague-headquartered firm that analyses its clients' social media metrics and produces reports on how their brands are faring with audiences. One of its products allows marketers to analyse and tweak their ads on Facebook based on demographic slices.\n\nIn a recent report, Gartner noted that half of digital marketing activities are outsourced to agencies. In particular, social analytics and management are particular hot areas for agencies, because companies don't have the in-house expertise or technologies to tackle these relatively new marketing platforms.\n\n\"Keeping customers interested through social channels requires constant feeding and nurturing with new content,\" it said.\n\nSocialbakers' backers believe the company could be poised to take advantage of this trend. The company made headlines when it raised US$26 million from venture capital investors in February. With this amount, it's now raised US$34 million since its founding in 2009.\n\nIn February, it opened its Asia-Pacific headquarters in Singapore. The office here has a dozen staff for now, and Mr Rezab said that it is hiring more customer service staff to satisfy the region's demand for more hands-on support.\n\n\"By 2017, Asia-Pacific will have the largest social network population worldwide,\" he noted.\n\nSingapore's opening follows the launch of offices in New York, Paris and Munich last year. The company now has a network of 12 offices around the world.\n\nLast year, it also tripled its revenue, and added more than 1,000 clients in the year, including Disney, Samsung and luxury group LVMH.\n\nIts 300 staff will grow to 400 within this year, as well.\n\nAs the company grows its presence, it is competing more fiercely with large software rivals who are keenly eyeing the space.\n\nIn June last year, Salesforce.com purchased social media analysis firm Buddy Media for US$689 million. Oracle bought another social media marketing player Vitrue for US$300 million.\n\nSocialbakers latched onto the potential of social media analysis early on. Mr Rezab said that the company didn't start out as a technology firm. It began as a social media agency, and built an analytics tool to support its consultancy service, but decided to focus solely on the tool after it realised it could reach more clients by providing the technology through agencies, instead.\n\nAlthough most of its clients are medium and large firms, he's noticed that more small firms are getting technical with social media. \"The smaller the retailer, the more important it is for them to be on Facebook,\" he said.\n\nBut he noted that there is a wealth of free tools that will suffice for small outfits. Only once companies reach the size where they have a dedicated marketing person should they start looking at paid tools such as Socialbakers', he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/agms-what-investors-want-know", "site_title": "AGMs: What investors want to know", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nAGMs: What investors want to know\n\nKey topics include strategic plans, executive pay, says TERRY WEE\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Apr 6, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE annual general meeting (AGM) is arguably the most important event for listed companies in the year. On this day, the company's board and key management meet their investors to provide an account of its performance and seek their approval on various matters.\n\nDuring AGMs, boards can address queries and strengthen relationships with investors who want to know that they have put their money in the right place.\n\nManaging the AGM and investors well will ensure their continued support. One key aspect of this is anticipating and preparing for questions that will be raised by shareholders.\n\nHere's my take on the key topics that investors are really interested in at an AGM:\n\n1. Company strategy\n\nInvestors are always keen to know more about the company's strategic direction, insights and plans. They turn up at AGMs particularly to find out how the company has mapped out its growth strategies, and how it will put those plans into measurable action.\n\nMost importantly, investors want to see returns on their investments, and to understand how the company's strategic plans and performance are reflected in the value of its share price and dividend.\n\nBoards should use the AGM well by taking time to describe the company's business, its growth plans and how it will allocate annual profits between reinvestment for future growth, and dividends to be returned to shareholders.\n\n2. Board composition\n\nShareholders care about who are the directors of their companies. This is reflected in their questions on board composition and ultimately their votes on the appointment of directors.\n\nAn ideal board comprises suitable members with the necessary expertise and know-how to lead the company in achieving its performance goals. Evidence of diversity in skill sets, experience, expertise and perspectives can help investors understand the rationale behind the composition of the board and how each member contributes to its optimum performance.\n\nGender diversity is getting more play. So, be prepared to answer questions on the board's thinking and plans if your company's board is without a single female director.\n\nTenures of directors are also increasingly being called to account. Institutional investors, in particular, reflect their objections to long tenures through their votes.\n\n3. Executive compensation\n\nThis has never been a more sensitive topic. The global financial crisis launched executive remuneration into the limelight, particularly in cases of vast discrepancies between the company's performance and executive pay.\n\nThe average investor's dissatisfaction and scepticism over executive pay has made companies think more seriously about compensation packages and, perhaps more importantly, the level of transparency in the disclosures of their compensation model. Essentially, investors want assurance that the levels and structure of executive compensation are aligned with the long-term interest and risk policies of the company.\n\nThe AGM is the platform to make a convincing case for how compensation must be attractive enough to retain and motivate executives for business performance, yet not cross a tolerance line for this purpose.\n\n4. Risks and controls\n\nUnder the Singapore Exchange listing rules, directors are required to opine on the adequacy of the company's internal controls to address financial, operational and compliance risks, including IT risks. So, the board must be prepared to discuss how it, together with the audit committee, has discharged its oversight role in the areas of internal controls and risk management.\n\nAdditionally, Principle 11 of the Code of Corporate Governance highlights the board's responsibility for risk governance. For this purpose, some boards establish a separate board risk committee, while others opt to have the audit committee cover risk oversight as part of its responsibilities.\n\nBoards must be mindful that board risk and audit committees cannot work separately from each other; otherwise the board will receive differing recommendations on the business, its risks and standards of reporting. Boards must be prepared to address investor questions on how\n\nthey marry opinions from both functions to arrive at decisions that are best for the company.\n\n5. Sustainability\n\nWith social and environmental concerns gaining traction globally, companies increasingly look to better manage sustainability-related opportunities and risks. Forward-looking firms now explore ways to embed sustainability into their company's core strategy and culture. They integrate sustainability metrics into financial reporting and executive compensation, and into supply chain risk management, particularly those related to gas emissions and resource usage.\n\nSingapore's recently passed laws, aimed at companies that contribute to trans-boundary haze, are a good example of how such a directive can impact a company's relations with investors, especially if its operational practices are deemed to worsen the environment.\n\nIntegrated reporting, which seeks to make sustainability issues mainstream, is currently in the limelight. While it is optional today, informed and socially conscious shareholders may ask the company when it intends to embrace the Integrated Reporting Framework to communicate how it creates value over time.\n\nThe writer is a member of the Advocacy & Research Committee of the Singapore Institute of Directors\n\nFor more articles, go to\n\nbtd.sg/BMatters\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Some of the companies have been in the news over a trading probe by the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD).\n\nMs Ng, formerly a large shareholder of construction firm Swee Hong, is also Ipco International's company secretary.\n\nBlumont said that its search for a replacement has been futile so far, partly because of the specialised nature of the mineral and energy resources sector.\n\nThe sharp market scrutiny of the firm has also resulted in most potential candidates expressing caution and asking for more time to consider the role, it added.\n\nOn top of that, Ms Ng's resignation had been unanticipated, leaving the firm no time to prepare for it.\n\nThe Christmas and Chinese New Year holiday periods also shortened the three-month period that it had, Blumont explained.\n\n\"The company was thus unable to appoint a suitable director within the fairly short reactionary time period,\" it said.\n\nA shareholder of the infamous trio of penny stocks Blumont, Asiasons Capital and LionGold, Ms Ng is pursuing legal action against Goldman Sachs for force-selling her Blumont and LionGold shares.\n\nTwo others, Quah Su-Ling, the chief executive of Ipco International, and James Hong, executive director of Blumont, have also taken similar action against the bank, which is countersuing both of them.\n\nMs Ng and Mr Hong are also two of 11 individuals now under investigation by the CAD, Singapore's white-collar crimebusters, for possible breaches of the Securities and Futures Act in the trading of the penny stocks trio last year.\n\nFirms involved have been asked to hand over all corporate electronic data from January 2011 onwards, and IT equipment and data storage belonging to these individuals.\n\nSeparately, Blumont posted updates about these investigations with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Securities Exchange yesterday.\n\nThe firm, which made a takeover bid for Australia-listed mineral miner Genesis Resources in January, also said it is seeking to ascertain whether a condition requiring Genesis' submission of a final feasibility study to the latter's joint venture partner by March 31 had been satisfied.\n\nThe counter fell 0.1 cent to 4.7 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Countries at the top include New Zealand in the first place, while Denmark and Finland were tied in the second. Sweden came in third, and Norway and Singapore shared the fourth spot.\n\nThe study, which assessed 48 developing and industrialised countries for the quality of their legal frameworks and effectiveness of their IP enforcement administrative functions, was published in the World Business Journal in January this year.\n\nSpeaking to BizIT, Tan Yih San, CEO of IPOS (Intellectual Property Office of Singapore), says there is still work to be done. \"By strengthening our capabilities and suite of IP services, and by building on our reputation of trust, knowledge infrastructure, and our connectedness to the world, we believe we can develop Singapore into the IP marketplace of choice in Asia.\"\n\nLast month, IPOS revamped its patent regime by moving from a self-assessment system to a positive grant framework. With this change, a patent granted in Singapore will have to fulfil all patentability requirements as advised by a newly built Patent Search-and-Examination unit under IPOS. This raises the overall quality of patents granted here and aligns Singapore's practices closer to those in the major markets such as Europe, Japan and the United States.\n\nWith higher quality and faster patents, Singapore businesses will have faster access to global markets, says Mr Tan. \"Businesses can ride on the suite of international patent agreements such as, Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH) agreements with US, Japan, China, South Korea and Mexico (to be effective by the second quarter of this year), and a purpose-built patent work sharing platform known as Asean Patent Examination Cooperation (Aspec).\n\n\"With these initiatives, companies can look forward to having applications accelerated to major markets with a net time saving of about 50 per cent. Hence, an estimated total turnaround time of three to four years instead of seven to eight years previously from Singapore to Asean countries, and a turnaround time of two to three years instead of five to six years to Japan and the US,\" he adds.\n\nIPOS has also introduced IP2SG, an integrated electronic-filing portal aimed at simplifying the process of e-filing and access to IP information and will soon roll-out an IP financing scheme where companies will be able to use granted patents as collateral for loans.\n\nMr Tan notes that with increased activity on patents there's an urgent need for more qualified patent examiners. \"The need has increased for two reasons. First, we have previously outsourced the work to European countries. Second, we anticipate a general increase in the demand for patent protection by the increasingly sophisticated and buoyant innovation eco-system in Singapore.\"\n\nAccording to the World Intellectual Property Organisation's statistics, the total number of patent applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty system exceeded the two million mark for the first time in 2011 and this figure has grown by 6-10 per cent on an annual basis.\n\nMr Tan notes that Singapore is ranked 16th in the world for patent filing in terms of patent volume. This comes in among major markets such as the China (ranked 1st), US (ranked 2nd) and Japan (ranked 3rd) in 2012. \"The need to upsize comes from an anticipated increase in patent examination work and applications to be filed in Singapore and the need to strengthen our capabilities to improve the speed and quality of our patent examination.\"\n\nThe current patent examination office in IPOS comprises a large number of PhD-trained patent examiners. Most examiners hold specialisations in biotechnology, pharmaceutics, chemistry, nano-materials, semiconductors and info-communications technology.\n\n\"They should be fluent in English as a working language as they will thereafter be put through a series of legal training on patent law, and specialised skills that are essential for patent search and examination,\" adds Mr Tan.\n\nFamous past patent examiners include Albert Einstein (1879-1955) who worked in the Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property and Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826) who worked in US Patent Office and became the 3rd president of the United States.\n\n\"This is an exciting career proposition for passionate individuals with a unique skill set. The greatest reward is the satisfaction of perusing new inventions on a daily basis. They could be life-saving drugs, or the newest smartphone technology that could come our way. Patent examiners can also take comfort that the remuneration is competitive and benchmarked with those in the Legal and R&D industry,\" notes Mr Tan.\n\nSingapore's IP ecosystem has registered good growth in 2012 calendar year, data for which is the latest available. Notably, trademark applications and design applications in 2012 increased by 5.9 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively compared to the year-ago period. Local patent applications grew by 2.4 per cent during the same period. This suggests the growing recognition of IP as an important enabler, driving innovation and economic growth among our local business and creators.\n\nLocally, top patent filers include the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star), and the National University of Singapore. A*Star is also the top overall filer followed by the LAM Research Corporation, an American corporation dealing with the fabrication of integrated circuits.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 4, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nJAPANESE architect/designer Oki Sato believes there are similarities between a pet shop owner and a designer. His childhood ambition was to own a pet shop. \"I like animals, but then I realised I would need to sell them, so I didn't want be a pet shop owner any more,\" says Mr Sato, 35.\n\nBeing a designer he says, is much like running a pet shop. \"My ideas are my pets, and I need to nurture and care for them, before clients will buy these ideas.\"\n\nIt is a rather unconventional analogy, but it is no surprise coming from Mr Sato, who founded his design studio nendo in 2002. The firm is known for creating quirky yet functional products, following Mr Sato's philosophy of \"giving people a small '!' moment\".\n\nTake for example a recent collaboration with Starbucks. Mr Sato took the coffee chain's classic white coffee mug and added a graphic to the base that looks like the surface of a coffee drink, so that when the mug is drying or stored upside down, it looks as though it is actually full. The mug comes in three varieties - Americano, latte and caramel macchiato and is sold in Starbucks outlets throughout Japan. Mr Sato describes this as a design that represents Starbucks' view of the world: of feeling fulfilled, and seeing the world as half-full, never half-empty.\n\nThe lanky Canadian-born designer graduated with a masters in architecture from Waseda University. But it was a visit to Milan Design Week in 2002 that got him truly interested in industrial design. \"Architects were designing small products, interior designers were designing the interiors of cars and not just spaces, the boundaries for each profession was blurred, and it hit me that I could design across different fields too,\" he says. This seamless flow between professions is also why he named his studio \"nendo\", meaning clay in Japanese. \"You can mould a piece of clay, change its shape, size and colour. For nendo, the design practice is about having fun, the flexibility and freedom to shape ideas,\" says Mr Sato.\n\nOver the years, Mr Sato's range of works include interior design for stores such as Issey Miyake and Camper, a bird house for Ando Foundation, furniture for brands including Moroso, Capellini and Offecct, as well as smaller items such as a chopstick collection for Hashikura Matsuka, Moleskin notebooks, goblets for Baccarat, and a paperclip-shaped thumbdrive for Elecom.\n\nHis latest collaboration is with bathroom specialist brand Hansgrohe, for which he has designed the Axor LampShower, a cross between a ceiling light and a shower.\n\nMr Sato who was in Singapore at the recent Maison&Objet Asia fair to promote the product, says the idea for the LampShower came about when he was thinking of how to combine light and water as a single object.\n\n\"It is easy to put LED lights around a shower, which is what has already been done, but I wanted to do it the other way around,\" he says.\n\nIn the case of the LampShower, the light is in the centre of the shower head. When the shower head is not turned on, the LampShower works like a light. \"And when it is turned on, the water diffuses the light,\" says Mr Sato, who added that this was one of his most difficult projects, which took three years to complete.\n\nBut he is confident that it will change the way people take showers. \"It can work as an outdoor shower, and even the idea of showering in the living room, instead of in the bathroom is possible,\" he says.\n\nWhile he has clients from A to Z, he says he will only work with those who have a passion for design. \"When there is a lack of passion, the project doesn't work out,\" he deadpans. \"And with Hansgrohe, they believe in the power of design, even though the LampShower marked the start of a technical nightmare for them.\"\n\nFor him, inspiration comes from everything and anything, \"even what others may consider boring, such as the scratches on the floor, or the gap in a table.\" He doesn't go in search of ideas, but rather takes in information as it comes, or by observing people. \"Most times, ideas come when you are not looking for them.\"\n\nHis goal as a designer is not to create new things. \"People are afraid of something that is too new,\" he explains. Rather, he works on creating items that are already existing but giving it a different twist.\n\nFor his collaboration with Danish brand BoConcept, Mr Sato was inspired by origami when he designed an armchair. The fusion chair with its sculptural, enveloping shape invites everyone to sit down and the fusion footstool is an elegant companion with its extra soft top cushion that fits with the soft, rounded lines of the chair.\n\nWhile his thought process is the same regardless of the project, \"design is about solving problems\". He says that he tries not to make the same mistakes. \"Every project has its success and mistakes,\" Mr Sato elaborates. \"With time, an idea becomes more precise, but it may get boring. So the formula is to try and find the right balance.\"\n\nIn 2012, he was named Designer of the Year by Wallpaper* Magazine and Elle Decor magazine. Yet, when asked how he knows if a project will be successful or not, he is stumped. \"With some products, you can see its immediate success. With others, it may take 10 years. But there is no point in looking back,\" he says in all seriousness.\n\nThen he breaks into a grin. \"When a client asks me back to do a second project, then I know it has been a success.\"\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But no one's convinced. Fund-raising plans have been scrapped or cut down, big buys shelved or left hanging and many investors have stomped out of these firms since the punishing event last October involving shares of Asiasons Capital, Blumont Group and LionGold Corp.\n\nNow, the firms' top executives and several subsidiaries are entangled in probes involving possible trading irregularities in the trio's shares. The CAD is working with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in the investigation. Those in CAD's cross hairs are mostly low-key individuals. Adding to their woes is that half of them are also caught up in legal tussles with banks and brokers expecting to recover hefty losses following the penny stock rout.\n\nExecutive chairman Neo Kim Hock, a Malaysian certified land surveyor with properties and construction interests in Malaysia and the United States, landed with an opportunity to invest in Singapore in 2003. The calling came in the form of struggling Adroit Innovations, now called Blumont. Mr Neo, 67, funded the deal by selling one of his companies partially to Ipco. A month after Mr Neo emerged as substantial shareholder, a board revamp ensued. Enter James Hong Gee Ho, the firm's executive director. Mr Neo's reach here has also widened. In 2006, he owned a 26 per cent stake in Magnus Energy, then listed on Sesdaq. As for Mr Hong, 47, he baffled the market in 2005 when he emerged as Greatronic's white knight. Why invest in a troubled company months after it had called in the CAD to investigate its Malaysian unit for inflating receivables?\n\nIndependent director Lynne Ng Su Ling is also Ipco's company secretary. Up until November, a month after the penny stock fiasco, when she unexpectedly stepped down, she was also Blumont's independent director. The gold miner's business and corporate development director Peter Chen Hing Woon's association with the group began in 2002. Magnus Energy, then called Strike Engineering, disposed a big stake in listed cable solutions firm Lantrovision to five people. Mr Chen was one of them. So was Mr Hong.\n\nAnnica, the counter which has been on a two-day trading halt, was the last of the eight to reveal details of the probe. It also seemed to have been the worst hit - so far. Its largest shareholder and executive director, Indonesian businessman Edwin Sugiarto, has had his passport impounded and is now on police bail after being \"interviewed\" by the CAD. Lim Meng Check, 43, stepped down as Annica's CEO in January 2013 to pursue other business opportunities. He held the post for four years and was also Ipco's independent director. He is also under probe. Mr Sugiarto first emerged in Annica in 2008 when it was called Oculus and was roiled by some $15 million in missing funds. Two years ago, he ran foul of the securities law and was fined by the MAS for late notification of the changes in his deemed interest of Annica. He was also a substantial shareholder of Australia-listed Merlin Diamonds, a firm which Innopac tried to take over in mid-2013.\n\nCEO Ho Cheng Leong, also the firm's shareholder, kicked off his career in the insurance sector and later joined Malaysia's MBF Group of Companies, then a huge diversified conglomerate and now a pale shadow of that. Mr Ho was also one of the placees of Annica Holdings' share placement in 2012, another related firm. ITE independent director Goh Hin Calm also handles Ipco's finance and administration matters and has been involved in other deals related to Innopac. Yesterday, Annica said Mr Goh, an independent director, is assisting the CAD with the investigations involving the firm. Ang Cheng Gian, 47, an accountant by profession, was appointed ITE's COO in 2005.\n\nCEO Quah Su-Yin, a Malaysian, has served the firm since 2011 when it was called Asiasons WFG Financial. She used to be head of institutional funds and client relations at Kuala Lumpur-based stockbroker AmInvestment. Insiders say Ms Quah and Ms Ng - both are qualified lawyers - were schoolmates, with Ms Quah's sister and Ipco CEO, Su-Ling.\n\nWong Chin-Yong has been Innopac's boss since 2001 and began his career in treasury management at several international banks here before he joined the MAS as a senior officer.\n\nExecutive director and chief operating officer Koh Teng Kiat joined in July 2004 from listed L&M Group Investments, where he was general manager of finance. The chartered accountant, 58, sits on the boards of all Magnus subsidiaries here and overseas, including the ones being investigated. Magnus chief financial officer Luke Ho Khee Yong's career path in the firm is patchy. He served as CFO between 2009 and 2011, left to join Asiasons WFG (now called ISR) and in less than a year, rejoined as CFO.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/mgcct-large-hk-retail-asset", "site_title": "MGCCT - a large HK retail asset", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nMGCCT - a large HK retail asset\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Apr 6, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nONE of the larger counters to hit the market last year was Mapletree Greater China Commercial Trust (MGCCT), also known by its Bloomberg name MAGIC:SP. The Reit's initial public offering last year raised $1.7 billion. MGCCT's advantage lies in its low cost of debt. Parent Mapletree Investments is wholly owned by Government investment company Temasek Holdings. MGCCT is the only overseas retail Reit here to have a credit rating. It is rated Baa1 by Moody's - putting it on an investment grade level that should allow for cheaper fundraising and higher gearing.\n\nMGCCT is not precisely a retail Reit, but more of a diversified counter that has exposure to both office and retail assets. The Reit has two assets worth a total of $4.4 billion: Festival Walk in Hong Kong and Gateway Plaza in Beijing. The retail component dominates for Festival Walk, and the office component dominates for Gateway Plaza.\n\nNevertheless, its main asset Festival Walk is essentially a giant shopping mall, contributing about three quarters of revenue and net property income. The property comprises seven storeys of retail and another four storeys of offices on top of the mall, with three floors of underground car parks. It has 580,000 sq ft of retail lettable area and 214,000 sq ft of office lettable area. Retail generates most of the rental income. It is by the Kowloon Tong MTR station, which is also an interchange for commuters to switch to a line to the New Territories and the China border.\n\nGateway Plaza is in Beijing's Chaoyang district, along the East Third Ring North Road, within what is known as the Lufthansa commercial and office area. It is an office building with a small retail component, with office rentals generating most of the income. A major tenant is automobile company BMW Group, which contributed 22 per cent of gross rental income, according to the Reit's prospectus. A CBRE report last April noted Beijing office space will see an undersupply situation in the next four years, in contrast to other cities.\n\nAfter a burst of excitement from investors following its IPO, the Reit, like others, was hit by fears of rising rates and outflows from emerging markets. As of end-March, it was trading at 81.5 cents, 12 per cent below its IPO price of 93 cents. At end-January, however, it announced third quarter results ending Dec 31 that were better than forecast, with Festival Walk tenants signing new leases that were 20 to 22 per cent higher. The price weakness caused DBS Group Research to upgrade the counter to \"buy\" on Jan 27.\n\nObservers have pointed out that the Reit has high concentration risk, given a large proportion of its revenues comes from just one asset.\n\nMGCCT's investment mandate, nevertheless, includes office and retail assets in Hong Kong, first tier and key second tier cities in China. Given that Mapletree is an active developer and investor, it is unlikely that MGCCT will just own two assets in the medium to long term.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Tsuyoshi Kitani, NTT Data's senior vice-president of R&D (headquarters), said the Singapore centre will be a key R&D hub for the region. \"NTT Data Asia Pacific plays a central role in developing the group's business footprint across the Asia Pacific region and will be responsible for the innovation lab in Singapore.\" he said.\n\nThe Singapore laboratory will formulate and drive technology strategy that matches Asia Pacific's diverse needs as well as NTT Data's regional business strategy, said Mr Kitani.\n\n\"Through collaboration with our group companies in the region, the laboratory will help drive the expansion of mature technologies like system integration and also drive pilot projects for technologies like big data and analytics, with applications in industry verticals such as manufacturing, healthcare, financial services and public services.\"\n\nThe Singapore lab will also conduct research based on local customers' needs and develop solutions that are best suited for the local market as well as other relevant markets across the Asia Pacific region, he added. Mr Kitani noted that NTT Data also intends to enhance its relationship with government organisations and advanced research institutes to drive pilot projects for technologies like big data and business analytics, and the knowledge obtained through this process will be used to develop new cutting-edge technologies that are market competitive.\n\nRio Fukaya, CEO of NTT Data Asia Pacific, said: \"NTT Data continues to consider Singapore a strategic hub within the Asia Pacific from a regional business as well as R&D operations perspective, and believes that Singapore possesses the necessary research capabilities, collaboration partners, talent and sophisticated end-users for companies like NTT Data to innovate for both their regional and global clients.\"\n\nKiren Kumar, director, infocomms & media, at the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB), said the EDB welcomes NTT Data's Innovation Laboratory in Singapore and is pleased that NTT Data is expanding into new areas such as applied analytics.\n\nHe added that Singapore would like NTT Data to continue to leverage Singapore's talent pool, advanced Information Communications Technologies (ICT) infrastructure and sophisticated demand for the co-creation and lead adoption of new ICT solutions.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The buy figures were up from the previous week's 12 companies, 26 purchases, and $5.25 million.\n\nOn the selling side, the number of firms and trades were down from the previous week's six companies and 13 disposals. The sell value, however, was up from the previous week's sales worth $277,000.\n\nAside from insider dealings, buyback activity rose last week with six companies reporting 16 repurchases worth $23.62 million. The number of trades was unchanged but the number of firms and value were up from the previous week's four companies and $12.7 million.\n\nThe huge value was due to heavy buybacks by Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC) and Singapore Airlines as these two firms acquired a combined $23.5 million worth of shares last week.\n\nOther than these two blue chips, another stock worth noting is HTL International as there were buybacks and insider purchases last week.\n\nMeanwhile, independent directors were particularly active with acquisitions in Pacific Radiance, Neo Group and Mermaid Maritime Public Company. There were also purchases by the heads of Zhongmin Baihui Retail Group and Xyec Holdings last week.\n\nOCBC\n\nOCBC bought shares back for the first time since October 2013 with 800,000 purchased from April 1 to 4 at an average of $9.65 each. The trades were made on the back of the 8 per cent drop in the share price since November 2013 from $10.53.\n\nThe group previously bought 14.46 million shares from February to October 2013 at $9.84 to $11.19 each or an average of $10.40 each.\n\nPrior to the buybacks since February 2013, OCBC acquired 18.2 million shares from January to November 2012 at $7.92 to $9.52 each or an average of $8.89 each and 213.1 million shares from March 2000 to December 2011 at $5.10 to $10.26 each or an average of $6.77 each. The stock closed at $9.71 on Friday.\n\nSingapore Airlines\n\nNational carrier Singapore Airlines (SIA) has been buying back at progressively higher prices in the past month with 2.646 million shares purchased from March 13 to April 3 at $10.11 to $10.46 each or an average of $10.34 each. SIA bought back shares on 11 out of the 16 trading days during that period. The repurchases accounted for 12 per cent of the stock's trading volume.\n\nSIA last bought back 1.5 million shares from March 31 to April 3 at an average of $10.44 each. Prior to the buybacks this year, it acquired 31 million shares from December 2010 to May 2012 at $10.16 to $15.27 each or an average of $11.43 each; 7.48 million shares from March 2008 to March 2009 at $9.39 to $16.12 each or an average of $13.01 each and 65.19 million shares from September 1999 to April 2001 at $11.50 to $15.90 each or an average of $15.69 each. The stock closed at $10.39 on Friday.\n\nHTL International\n\nThere was a buyback and purchase by co-founder and deputy chairman Phua Yong Sin in leather furniture manufacturer HTL International Holdings with a combined 43,000 shares purchased from April 1 to 4 at an average of 28 cents each. The were on the back of the 27 per cent drop in the share price since September 2013 from 38.5 cents.\n\nHTL recorded its first buyback since November 2010 with 7,000 shares purchased on April 1 at 27 cents each It previously acquired 17.34 million shares from March 2009 to November 2010 at 8 cents to 68 cents each or an average of 53 cents each.\n\nMr Phua purchased 36,000 shares on April 4 at 28 cents each, which increased his direct holdings by 7 per cent to 588,000 shares or 0.14 per cent of the issued capital. He also has deemed interest of 194.202 million shares or 47.8 per cent.\n\nHe previously acquired 12,000 shares in June 2013 at 29 cents each and 619,000 shares from May 2011 to June 2012 at 47 cents to 31 cents each or an average of 43.4 cents each. The counter closed at 28 cents on Friday.\n\nPacific Radiance\n\nIndependent director Goh Chong Theng recorded his first on-market trade in offshore vessels and support services provider Pacific Radiance since the stock was listed in November 2013 with 30,000 shares purchased on April 4 at $1.10 each.\n\nThe trade increased his direct holdings by 60 per cent to 80,000 shares or 0.01 per cent of the issued capital. The trade was made on the back of the 30 per cent rise in the share price since December 2013 from 84.5 cents. Mr. Goh's purchase price was sharply higher than the IPO price of 90 cents.\n\nTwo other directors have bought shares since listing. Chairman Pang Yoke Min acquired an initial 786,000 shares from Dec 26 to 27, 2013 at 85 cents each. The shares bought represented 0.11 per cent of the issued capital.\n\nNon-executive director Yong Yin Min in the meantime bought 1.123 million shares on Nov 18, 2013 at 88 cents each, which boosted his direct stake to 28.865 million shares or 3.98 per cent.\n\nThe counter closed at $1.10 on Friday.\n\nNeo Group\n\nIndependent director Kevin Ng How Hwan resumed buying shares of food catering firm Neo Group at a higher price with 50,000 shares purchased on March 28 at 92 cents each. The trade increased his direct holdings by 13 per cent to 439,000 shares or 0.3 per cent of the issued capital.\n\nThe acquisition was made after the stock rebounded by 17 per cent from 78.5 cents on March 20. Despite the rebound in the share price, the counter is still down since February from 98 cents. The purchase was also made after the company announced on March 28 a 111.9 per cent gain in annual profit to $6.398 million. He previously acquired 64,000 shares on Jan 24 at 80 cents each and 150,000 shares from September to December 2013 at 51 cents to 60 cents each or an average of 57 cents each.\n\nThe purchases since September 2013 are Mr Ng's first on-market trades since the stock was listed in July 2012. The director's purchase prices were sharply higher than the IPO price of 30 cents. The counter closed at 89 cents on Friday.\n\nMermaid Maritime\n\nIndependent director Jan Skorupa recorded his first on-market trade in drilling and sub-sea engineering services provider Mermaid Maritime Public Company since his appointment in October 2013 with an initial 80,000 shares purchased on March 28 at 45 cents each. The shares bought represented 0.01 per cent of the issued capital.\n\nThe acquisition was made on the back of the 17 per cent drop in the share price since January from 54 cents. Despite the fall in the share price, the counter is still up since August 2013 from 27.5 cents. The counter closed at 50.5 cents on Friday.\n\nZhongmin Baihui Retail\n\nCEO Chen Kaitong recorded his first on-market buy in mainland department store operator Zhongmin Baihui Retail Group since the stock was listed in September 2013 on the SGX mainboard with one million shares purchased on April 1 at $1.75 each. The trade increased his direct holdings to 41.470 million shares or 21.12 per cent of the issued capital. The acquisition was made on the back of the 8 per cent rise in the share price since April 2013 from $1.62.\n\nInterestingly, the purchase was made at higher than his sale price last year based on the 6.1 million shares that he sold in March 2013 at $1.50 each. The CEO's trade prices were sharply higher than the IPO price of 30 cents. The stock closed at $1.76 on Friday.\n\nXyec Holdings\n\nChairman & CEO Manabu Kobayashi and Mamezou Holdings acquired shares of integrated engineering and IT services provider Xyec Holdings last month. The purchases were made after the stock rebounded from 15.1 cents on March 13.\n\nMr Kobayashi purchased 350,000 shares on March 31 at 21 cents each, which increased his direct holdings by 28 per cent to 1.595 million shares or 1.45 per cent of the issued capital. He previously acquired 300,000 shares in December 2013 at 15.1 cents each. The purchases by Mr Manabu since December 2013 are his first on-market trades since the stock was listed in September 2013. His purchase prices were lower than the IPO price of 26 cents.\n\nMamezou Holdings, on the other hand, reported a purchase-related filing on March 24 of 150,000 shares at 17.7 cents each, which boosted its direct stake to 30.926 million shares or 28.11 per cent.\n\nAlso positive this year is Xyec Holdings' Employee Stock Holding Association with a purchase-related filing on Feb 3 of 60,000 shares at 18.5 cents each, which increased its direct holdings to 11.040 million shares or 10.03 per cent. The counter closed at 26 cents on Friday.\n\nThe writer is managing director, Asia Insider Limited\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will satisfy claims of more than 26,000 securities and commodities customers.\n\nMF Global Holdings Ltd, the brokerage's parent company, filed for bankruptcy on Oct 31, 2011, after a wrong-way, US$6.3 billion bet on bonds of some of Europe's most indebted nations. More than US$1.6 billion in customer funds that should have been segregated were missing. The company listed assets of US$41 billion and debts of US$39.7 billion.\n\n\"Ensuring full restitution to customers has been a primary focus,\" Gretchen Lowe, acting director of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's division of enforcement, said on Thursday in a statement. The CFTC will \"continue to ensure that those who violate US commodity laws and regulations designed to protect customer funds will be held accountable,\" she said.\n\nInterim distributions have been made to customers. The final distribution was made possible by a temporary loan from the general estate of the brokerage's bankruptcy and decisions by US Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn and US District Judge Victor Marrero in New York to reject objections by ex-managers including Mr Corzine, the former MF Global chairman and chief executive officer.\n\n\"The 100 per cent customer recovery does not diminish the consequences of the unprecedented customer property segregation failure that led to MFGI's liquidation, including the length of time customers have been without their property,\" Mr Giddens said in Thursday's statement.

Rolls-Royce signed a $75 million deal with one university last year to do research into computational engineering and other areas.\n\nThe EDB lured technology companies in the late 1960s and 1970s with incentives and low-cost labour. Operations to assemble televisions and components have gone to Asian countries with much lower wages. However, manufacturing still accounts for about 20 per cent of Singapore's gross domestic product and the government wants the level to remain 20-25 per cent.\n\nSingapore is focused on developing a regional manufacturing supply chain, where companies can base labour-intensive work in nearby countries, while engineering and design work is done at home.\n\nAnd it hosts sophisticated manufacturing. About one-third of the world's hearing aids are made here, many by German engineering conglomerate Siemens AG.\n\nBut for manufacturing in general, \"it's not possible for us to do everything in Singapore\", said Mr Yeoh. \"Activities which are much more labour-intensive and can't be sustained in Singapore will need to move out\".\n\nHe is hoping higher-paid work in sectors such as 3D printing and biologics - making drugs from proteins in cell cultures rather than synthetically - can expand.\n\nIn the services sector, Singapore wants to develop technologies for e-commerce and big data.\n\nThe city-state has a target of 2,500 data analytics professionals by 2017. Already, about half of South-east Asia's data centre capacity is in Singapore.\n\n\"That's not because we have low-cost energy, we don't, or because our weather is cool, it's not, but because companies feel very confident about the security of the data residing in Singapore,\" said Mr Yeoh, who has led the EDB since 2012.\n\nThe shipyard industry is one that may have to shrink as part of the government's productivity drive. While it employs 120,000 of the city-state's 5.3 million people, the number of foreign workers versus local is 5-to-1, a ratio the government wants at 3.5-to-1 by 2018.\n\nOne set of foreigners the government is keen to maintain are top-level executives, as it tries to get more multinationals to set up regional or international headquarters.\n\nLast year, Singapore received a boost when General Motors said it would shift a unit that oversees much of its international operations to Singapore from Shanghai, a decade after the company left the island.\n\nSingapore's low taxes and high living standards make it a popular choice. A study by the Frontier strategy group in 2010 found that 44 per cent of global companies' Asian headquarters were in Singapore, compared with 17 per cent in Hong Kong and 13 per cent in Shanghai.\n\nBASF and IBM are among corporates that have moved global units, led by key executives, to Singapore. \"These are top-calibre leaders - the question for us is whether we can see Singaporeans eventually taking on these positions,\" said Mr Yeoh.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/craft-food-producers-go-social", "site_title": "Craft food producers go #social", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nCraft food producers go #social\n\nThe new generation of artisanal food makers are turning to social media to create a buzz for their homespun products. Debbie Yong looks at how the local craft food scene has undergone a hip revolution\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 4, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHEY'RE young, design-conscious and highly Internet-savvy - and they're turning to social media to hawk their homemade edible goods.\n\nUnlike the kaya-churning and chinchalok-bottling aunties of yesterday, who largely relied on word-of-mouth marketing, today's burgeoning crop of craft food producers are gathering a fast audience from the virtual realm.\n\nMost of these brands develop along a similar trajectory: a food-loving individual or family whips up a homemade batch of sauces or snacks; friends and family become taste testers-turned-customers; and soon - thanks to the visibility afforded by social media platforms such as Facebook or Instagram - an extended circle of curious parties start calling for it to be produced and retailed on a larger scale. More than six new small-scale food producers, largely run by people in their late 20s and early 30s, have emerged in the last six months, and almost all say that online branding has significantly bolstered their coffers.\n\n\"I didn't grow up in the digital world, but getting into it was a necessity when I started my business,\" admits granola maker The Edible Company's founder Genevieve Lee, 34, who tweets under @theedibleco and shares photos on Instagram under the handle @iamsally. \"Now, social media makes all the difference. If a friend who has 24,000 followers posts a photo of my granola, I'll get 20 to 30 new followers and lots of people asking where to buy it within a few hours,\" she says.\n\nBanking on connectivity\n\nOne company, Shiok Until Blur, was entirely borne out of Instagram. Dinner table snapshots of their parents' homemade sambal became such a big hit online for former flight stewardess Ili Dianah and her siblings that they eventually succumbed to overwhelming enquiries to register a business to bottle it for sale. Her sisters, professional blogger Diah Masturah, 33, and television actress Nurul Aini, 32, have 15,000 and 48,000 followers on Instagram respectively.\n\nThe sisters now help to market the brand, Supershiok Sambal, while her parents are in charge of producing up to 2,500 bottles of sauces monthly. They will be relocating their home-based production process to a rented commercial kitchen space in the coming months to handle booming demand. Incidentally, her 57-year-old father (@lanchillicrab) now has his own Instagram account with 4,000 followers.\n\nAs small yields allow them to personally oversee what goes into each jar or bottle, craft food makers mostly bank on their goods' all-natural, preservatives-free production processes and shorter supply chains to get an edge in freshness and nutritional value over commercially mass-produced - though often cheaper - alternatives. The Edible Company's granola and Supershiok Sambal, for instance, are made and delivered to order weekly.\n\nIn keeping with their made-in-Singapore label and the increasingly provenance-conscious local palates that seek them, craft food producers are also incorporating Asian-inspired flavours into traditionally Western food products for a fresh spin. Eastern Granola's rolled oats are baked with South-east Asian ingredients such as gula melaka, curry powder and fish sauce, while homegrown company Three Bites Full's gourmet nougats has flavours such as Japanese sweet potato and bubur cha cha.\n\n\"With consumers becoming more picky, you can't just make regular kaya at home. You need to have a special ingredient to help you stand out,\" says Angela Phua, 28, the former corporate banker behind A.muse Projects. Her speciality tea brand's signature is its Inspired range of blended teas that mimic the flavours of coffee and wines such as Riesling, Chardonnay and Merlot. For her, social media \"is a cheap form of a focus group\". Besides following other tea brands and retailers to assess trends in the tea market, she also tracks individuals for tea consumption patterns and feedback.\n\n\"While good things spread very fast on social media, the same applies to negative feedback so you have to be very careful,\" she cautions. The fickle nature of social media also means that constant updating is required, say many producers. Yet, it has to be handled with a subtle hand, Ms Ili adds, as \"people get annoyed at constant hard-selling.\"\n\n\"It's easy to reach many people, but it's hard to understand what it all means,\" such as how much a large online following actually translates into actual sales, says architect Ong Ker-Shing, 38, who runs Two Rabbits Smoky Chilli with her younger brother Ong En-Ming, 27.\n\nTo help bridge the chasm between farmers' markets, where producers typically only sell 50 to 100 bottles each time, and supplying to supermarkets, which require quantities in the thousands - far beyond the production capabilities of small-scale producers - Mr Ong hopes to establish an online farmers' market to collectively push the local craft food movement. \"It's a chicken-and-egg problem. Many of us don't dare to expand production without demand, but without more production, we can't grow our demand,\" he points out.\n\nEarly stirrings of a local craft food community are already present, it seems. Eastern Granola's founder and former food editor Chin Hui Wen, 25, is also behind Crust Project, an online collection of background stories showcasing local food producers in the effort to get conversations between them going. She hopes to independently publish a craft food-centric magazine styled after cult lifestyle magazine, Kinfolk, later this year.\n\nJust yesterday, leading local online retailer Naiise expanded their range of homeware and lifestyle products to include a section dedicated entirely to locally crafted foods.\n\nBesides giving small-scale producers an online retail and marketing platform, Naiise also helps them handle customer service \"which further reduces the time food producers need to spend delivering individual orders,\" says its founder Dennis Tay, 29. \"All of this enables them to spend more of their limited time and resources on their food production.\"\n\nMr Tay also plans to organise physical events in the near future to both showcase the local makers, as well as help ease the transition to buying online for Internet non-natives.\n\nAs Monica Josephine, 27, one-half of the Indonesian sisters behind homemade Mofo Chilli, puts it, \"with online, everything has to be very visual and packaged beautifully.\" But at the end of the day, food is a very taste and tactile-centred experience, she points out, and online platforms can supplement but not substitute the experience of meeting customers and letting them taste products at traditional venues such as retail stores and farmers' markets.\n\nFood incubators\n\nThe Edible Company's Ms Lee has a loftier wishlist: she hopes to see more food incubators emerge here. Increasingly popular in London and in cities across the United States, food incubators are fully licensed commercial kitchens that can be shared and rented out to individuals for small-batch food production. \"It can be very daunting to start something new. You often feel like it is not possible even before you begin, because there are so many rules and regulations,\" she explains.\n\nUnder the Home Based Small Scale Business Scheme by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) and Urban Redevelopment Authority, residents may use their HDB and private residential premises to prepare small quantities of food for sale to their friends and relatives. Food-related business activities that are advertised online and require the use of commercial grade equipment, however, have to be prepared in properly licensed premises.\n\nKitchen Lab 1 in MacPherson Road, is one such local venue. Started last year by online baker Sheryl Lim, 26, the small commercial kitchen tucked away in an industrial canteen is open 24 hours a day and has two commercial baking ovens, commercial baking racks, chillers, freezers and mixers that can be rented for use starting from $9 an hour.\n\n\"There should be be a time limit of say, six months - enough to give new food producers wings - so there will be space for the next person,\" Ms Lee suggests. \"We're too small of a market to be competing with one another.

Think about using Google Earth: from a moon's-eye view of North America, we can quickly close in on a major landmark or our own house, discerning details that are invisible in the larger picture. The same is true with wine.\n\nTake New Zealand, for instance. When we think of that country's wine, what comes to mind first is its sauvignon blanc: grassy, somewhat aggressive, with racy acidity. But look beyond that and you'll find pinot noir, New Zealand's second-most important wine. And there are others.\n\nIf you pay attention to labels, you've noticed the name Marlborough; it's the country's most important wine region, at the northern end of the South Island. It's a good benchmark to compare with other regions. Martinborough, on the North Island, produces sauvignon blanc that tends to be riper. Even farther north, around Hawke's Bay, cabernet sauvignon and syrah vines predominate. Central Otago, the mountainous land of hobbits and orcs on the South Island, turns out earthy and rugged pinot noir. From the initial wide-angle view of one dominant wine variety, we've discovered a diverse wine map with many styles and varieties.\n\nJust west of Marlborough is a much smaller wine region around the city of Nelson. Although the two areas produce similar wines, there are subtle yet distinct differences between them. I was able to explore those expressions during a brief visit to New Zealand several months ago.\n\nMarlborough is a crowd-pleaser, producing vast quantities of wine, the cheap and serviceable as well as the intense, lush and full-bodied. Almost always the emphasis is on fruit, and the best wines taste simply joyful, with amazingly long finishes. Nelson's wines are leaner, more minerally, even cerebral. As Todd Stevens, winemaker at Neudorf Vineyards, explained, Nelson has warmer days and cooler evenings than Marlborough, lending tighter acidity to the wines.\n\n\"We tend to be in the greener, tropical end of the flavour spectrum instead of the huge passion fruit,\" Stevens says. There's plenty of tropical fruit to go around: Neudorf's sauvignon blanc, Riesling and especially its chardonnay are terrific, and its pinot noir is impeccable, with bing cherry flavours and firm acidity.\n\nNelson's vineyards are in two areas: the Moutere Hills, where red clay soils favour fuller-bodied chardonnay and pinot noir, and gravelly plains closer to the shore, where alluvial soils favour crisp whites such as sauvignon blanc, Riesling, pinot gris and even gruner veltliner. That's where the Seifried Estate Winery produces outstanding wines under the Seifried and Old Coach Road labels. The sauvignon blancs from the outstanding 2013 vintage are noteworthy.\n\nMarlborough's main vineyard lands stretch along the south bank of the Wairau River as it flows east toward Cloudy Bay near the small city of Blenheim. Tributary valleys stretch southward, offering steep slopes that are ideal for the region's pinot noir. Farther south, another east-west valley called Awatere is producing thrilling savvies. It's considered part of Marlborough, but I wouldn't be surprised to see Awatere Valley receive its own designation once more wineries exploit its potential.\n\nTwo of Marlborough's pioneers are refining the region's expression of sauvignon blanc. Ivan Sutherland and James Healy spent 18 years managing Cloudy Bay winery as that label established New Zealand's reputation for sauvignon blanc. Now that Marlborough has become commercialised they keep raising the quality bar with their boutique bottlings from Dog Point Vineyard.\n\n\"Generic wine is fresh and lifted\" - meaning fruity - \"but we didn't want the same old in-your-face aromatics and tutti-frutti flavours\", Sutherland says. Their answer was to reduce crop yields to 7.5 tonnes per hectare, compared with the regional average of 12, and to pick the grapes by hand instead of machine.\n\n\"A lot of people are mucking around with different ways of making sauvignon blanc,\" Healy says. \"Most try new oak and malolactic fermentation. We are not fans of new oak around Marlborough sauvignon,\" Sutherland adds.\n\nThe duo does muck around a bit. Their Section 94 sauvignon blanc is fermented and aged for 18 months in old oak barrels on the grape solids, with no exposure to oxygen. Healy calls it \"the stinky sauvignon\". It's tarry, like a strong mineral water, and flinty. It probably won't become a mainstream expression of Marlborough wine, but it will interest adventurous oenophiles. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nLifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}

Private employment, which excludes government jobs, surpassed the pre-recession peak for the first time.\n\nUS stocks advanced, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) erasing its loss for the year, after the government report showing employers added to payrolls last month boosted confidence in the world's largest economy. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index gained 0.4 per cent to an all-time high of 1,896.51 at 9.31am in New York. The DJIA added 39.43 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 16,611.98 yesterday, topping the index's closing record of 16,576.66 on Dec 31.\n\n\"The fact that the payroll number was not way out of line of expectations has given relief to the markets,\" said Matt Maley, an equity strategist with Miller Tabak & Co. \"The economy is improving, but it's not improving too much. You don't want this thing chugging along too much, because interest rates move up, and that scares people off.\"\n\nEmployment in January and February was revised higher, showing the effect on the labour market from inclement winter weather was less severe than previously thought. The gain puts payroll growth in step with the average over the past two years and shows companies are optimistic about the outlook for demand.\n\n\"The labour market is doing fine,\" Brett Ryan, an economist with Deutsche Bank Securities Inc, said before the report. \"The trend before we had all these weather issues hasn't changed much. We're starting to see a recovery.\"\n\nRevisions to prior reports added a total of 37,000 jobs to payrolls in the previous two months. The report also showed an increase in hours worked and little change in hourly earnings from February. Forecasts for March payrolls ranged from increases of 150,000 to 275,000 after a previously reported 175,000 gain a month earlier, according to the Bloomberg survey of 90 economists. Last year, the US added 194,000 jobs each month on average after 186,000 in 2012.\n\nThe agency's survey of households showed about half a million people entered the labour force and, at the same time, almost as many found work. The figures also showed an increase in the number of people employed part-time. The so-called participation rate, which indicates the share of working-age people in the labour force, increased to 63.2 per cent from 63 per cent a month earlier.\n\nPrivate payrolls increased 192,000 in March, the most in four months, after a 188,000 gain. With last month's increase, total private payrolls reached 116.1 million, surpassing the pre-recession peak.\n\nThe US has recovered all but 437,000 of the 8.7 million jobs, including those at government agencies, lost as a result of the last recession. Factories reduced payrolls by 1,000 workers after adding 19,000 in February, yesterday's report showed. Construction companies boosted employment by 19,000 workers and retail payrolls rebounded 21,300.\n\nThe number of temporary workers jumped 28,500.\n\nRecent data have pointed to a thaw in the economy and the labour market as temperatures began to warm.\n\nA report on Thursday showed service industries, which account for almost 90 per cent of the economy, improved and more companies said they were adding to headcount.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) non-manufacturing index rose to 53.1 in March from a four-year low of 51.6 a month earlier. The Tempe, Arizona-based ISM said its measure of employment increased by the most on record.\n\nFed Chair Janet Yellen highlighted inconsistencies in labour-market data in a speech this week, saying that the recovery \"still feels like a recession to many Americans\".\n\n\"The numbers of people who have been trying to find work for more than six months or more than a year are much higher today than they ever were since records began decades ago,\" Ms Yellen said at a conference in Chicago. \"While there has been steady progress, there is also no doubt that the economy and the job market are not back to normal health.\"\n\nFaster employment growth would help stoke wage gains and embolden households, whose spending accounts for almost 70 per cent of the economy.

The Reit offers exposure to suburban malls in Indonesia, another emerging giant.\n\nDBS Group Research said in a February report that retail space in Jakarta, where many Lippo Reit malls are based, is becoming tighter. This means mall operators could have better bargaining power when negotiating rents, it said. The Jakarta government is also restricting new malls from being built due to traffic problems and to improve city planning efforts. Rents in Jakarta are also among the lowest in the region, DBS said.\n\nLippo Reit is sponsored by Indonesian conglomerate Lippo Group. The group was founded by Indonesian tycoon Mochtar Riady, who built a business empire spanning financial services, hotels, resorts, malls, natural resources, healthcare and residential properties.\n\nLippo's other listed companies in Singapore include real estate company Overseas Union Enterprise (OUE) which made an unsuccessful bid for Fraser & Neave in 2012, and Auric Pacific, maker of Sunshine bread, owner of Delifrance and Food Junction. Other than Lippo Malls, two other Reits are connected to Lippo: hospital owner First Reit, and OUE Commercial Reit which owns the OUE Bayfront office tower and Shanghai's Lippo Plaza. There is also stapled security OUE Hospitality Trust, which owns the Mandarin Orchard hotel and Mandarin Gallery mall.\n\nLippo Reit owns 16 malls and 7 retail spaces in Indonesia, worth a combined $1.4 billion at end-2013. Retail spaces refer to department stores, hypermarkets and amusement centres located inside other malls. They usually include Matahari, a ubiquitous departmental store chain in Indonesia.\n\nNine malls and three spaces are located in Jakarta or the greater Jakarta area. The remainder are in major cities like Bandung, Medan, Palembang and Semarang.\n\nThe mall with the largest valuation (S$168 million, 12 per cent of total) is Medan's Sun Plaza. Medan is the capital of Indonesia's North Sumatra province. It has over 2 million people and is the fourth largest city in Indonesia. The mall itself is located in Medan's commercial district, and contains over 700,000 sq ft of net lettable area - about the same space Orchard's Paragon mall has.\n\nLippo's two next most valuable malls are in Jakarta. Pluit Village (S$146 million, 10.4 per cent) in North Jakarta is \"surrounded by affluent residential estates and apartments with a Chinese ethnic majority\" according to Lippo. The Plaza Semanggi (S$144 million, 10.2 per cent) is in Jakarta's central business district.\n\nMall valuations, however, have dropped sharply in the past year. This is due to the 15 per cent depreciation of the Indonesian rupiah compared to a year ago. Investors pulled money out of Indonesia upon fears of higher US interest rates. The Reit's reporting currency is in Singapore dollars.\n\nLippo Reit's net asset value per unit fell from 56 Singapore cents at end-2012 to 41 cents at end-2013, in part also due to a share placement. Fourth quarter distributable income fell 15 per cent to $13.8 million. Gearing, a measure of the Reit's debt and deferred payments versus the value of its properties, jumped sharply due to lower property valuations, from 24.5 per cent at end-2012 to 34.3 per cent at end-2013. Under the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) guidelines, Reits without a credit rating (like Lippo) can only borrow up to 35 per cent of the value of its deposited property.\n\nThe MAS also stated that the borrowing limit will not be considered to be breached if leverage rises due to circumstances beyond the property fund manager's control like an asset depreciation or unit redemption. In these circumstances, managers \"should not\" borrow more, the MAS said. Another problem with a depreciating foreign currency is that if debt is denominated in Singapore dollars, as is Lippo's, the Reit's assets will have to sweat more to earn enough to make interest payments. Reits hedge against fluctuations in currency as well as interest rates, but they can still be caught out by a sudden move in financial markets.\n\nAccording to OCBC, Lippo Reit's cost of debt has increased over the course of 2013, and is the highest among the four overseas retail Reits.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Chew Hui Yan\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 4, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nAPOLLONIA Poilane was not your average university student. She attended classes, did her homework and had a social life, but she also ran a company half-way around the world in Paris from her Harvard dorm room. The company - Boulangerie Poilane - was no small start-up either by the then 18-year-old. It was a well-established Parisian bread empire that had been started by her grandfather, Pierre Poilane, in 1932 and passed down to her father, Lionel Poilane.\n\nIn 2002, both Mr Poilane and his wife, Irena, were killed in a tragic helicopter accident leaving Ms Poilane and her then 16-year-old sister, Athena. Ms Poilane, who had always known that she would eventually take over the business, put the plans she had for a gap year on hold and took over the reins. When she left for Harvard to study Economics 10 months later, Ms Poilane was determined to run the company from her dorm.\n\n\"I left for college with an idea of how I was going to handle the business and after that, it was all about adapting. In the first semester, it was a little hard figuring out a way to go about my day's work but after that I had a routine,\" she says.\n\nThis routine was a call before bed to her team in Paris for a quick update on how production was the night before and a second call the morning after to find out what business needed to be done for the day. She would then go to class, attend to business, do her homework and repeat the routine. Ms Poilane did this for four years while spending all her school holidays back in Paris working at the shop. Just reading Ms Poilane's schedule alone can make one exhausted but the now 29-year-old says that juggling school, work and her social life was not as hard as it sounds.\n\nShe brushes it off saying: \"There were other kids who were athletes and members of various student groups. So I guess for me my extra-curricular activity was a company! It wasn't tough and it wasn't exhausting. I think like anything it's a responsibility. As long as I did my homework and reading on a regular basis, I was fine.\"\n\nShe also emphasises the help and support that she received from family and friends during the four years. However, Ms Poilane does admit that during her senior year, there were some projects for the Poilane business that she had to postpone till she had graduated and returned to Paris. \"A lot of what helped was the friends of my parents who were there to support me and answer any and all questions that I had. My sister and I are very close and she grew up in the shop too. She was 16 at the time but she was always there for me,\" she says.\n\nEven now, Ms Poilane and her sister are a team - running Boulangerie Poilane and working mostly on business strategy together. With the two in charge, the company has seen both product and business grow. The number of outlets has increased from three to five, with one new boulangerie in Paris and London each. Ms Poilane also opened three cafes called Cuisine de Bar attached to the bakeries which serve tartines - or open-faced sandwiches - using Poilane's signature sourdough bread.\n\nIn fact, the tartines - made just as they are in Paris and London - are available at the Hyatt's afternoon tea buffet till next Sunday. With regard to product development, Ms Poilane says that along with discovering new flavours, she is always looking for new ways to work with old ingredients. \"We are always innovating. I think you can do that with bread a lot even if it's going back in history and reinventing traditions,\" says Ms Poilane.\n\nBread fans in Singapore will be pleased to know that Ms Poilane says she would like to bring some of her other products from Paris such as black pepper loaf to Singapore. But despite the constant innovation and business development, Ms Poilane says that there are some traditions that she intends to uphold. She refuses to compromise on the quality of the bread and the way it was made, using the same techniques that were adopted by her father and grandfather.\n\n\"We bake the bread by using a piece of sourdough from the previous batch as a starter for the next. I think that link between each batch of bread is something that's important to me because I'm the third generation in this business. It really reflects continuity,\" she says.\n\nPoilane sourdough loaves - known as miche - are available at a pop-up store in the Hyatt lobby till April 13, Sunday. They're flown in every two days from Boulangerie Poilane in Paris and cost $28 for a whole loaf, $18 for half a loaf and $8 for a quarter loaf. The tartines are available at the Hyatt's afternoon tea buffet which costs $43 on weekdays and $53 on weekends.\n\nhychew@sph.com.sg\n\nMackerel Tartine\n\nIngredients\n\nPoilane sourdough bread\n\nSmoked mackerel\n\nCreme Fraiche\n\nLemon Juice\n\nPaprika Powder\n\nChives\n\nMethod\n\n1.

Meanwhile, capacity, measured in available-seat-kilometres, grew by 5.2 per cent, nudging passenger load factor up to 78.1 per cent.\n\nFor the first two months of this year, passenger traffic, measured in revenue-passenger-kilometres, was up 6.9 per cent, surpassing the 5.2 per cent in the same period last year, figures released by the International Air Transport Association (Iata) yesterday showed. \"People are flying. Strong demand is consistent with the pick-up in global economic growth, particularly in advanced economies,\" said Iata director-general Tony Tyler.\n\nOn international markets, Asia-Pacific carriers saw growth moderating to 4 per cent in February, from 8.3 per cent in January, though this was partly due to seasonal factors as Chinese New Year fell in January this year. Last year, Chinese New Year was in February. Capacity in the Asia-Pacific region, however, expanded at a faster 5.1 per cent in February, pushing load factor down to 76.8 per cent.\n\nWhile economic activity in the region remains largely strong and trade volumes are on an upward track, China poses possible downside risks given that business activity in Asia's largest economy fell for the third month in a row in February, Iata warned.\n\nPassenger traffic grew at the fastest pace in the Middle East, at 13.4 per cent, bolstered by its robust regional economies and rising demand for premium travel. Europe expanded at 5.8 per cent as the eurozone continues to pull itself out of its economic doldrums. Latin American carriers posted 4.2 per cent growth in international travel in February, with the outlook remaining \"broadly positive\", thanks in part to stronger economic performances from countries such as Colombia, Peru and Chile, as well as the upcoming Fifa World Cup which takes place in Brazil from June.\n\nNorth American airlines registered 2 per cent expansion in international passenger traffic, though Iata expects stronger growth in coming months as employment growth and consumer spend show signs of picking up. African carriers, on the other hand, recorded flat growth in air travel volumes, which could be linked to a slowdown in some major economies in the region, such as South Africa. On the domestic market, air travel volumes increased 5.3 per cent in February, with markets such as Russia, China and Brazil recording double-digit growth.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Justine Moss\n\nPublished Fri, Apr 4, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWHEN next week's edition of the US Masters tees off, this year's first major will be missing a player who had his greatest victory at Augusta back in 1997 in a record-breaking performance where he won the tournament by 12 strokes. Tiger Woods, who went on to win again in 2001, 2002 and 2005, withdrew from the 2014 tournament recently as a result of back problems - a herniated disc was pressing against a nerve, causing pain and spasms. This week saw him undergo surgery for a pinched nerve, meaning that the world number one will have to wait for an opportunity to add to his major haul of 14 victories and his first since the US Open back in 2008. It will also be the first time since 1995 that he has not played in the Augusta event.\n\nA statement on his website stated, \"Woods will begin intensive rehabilitation and soft-tissue treatment within a week. Healing and recovery times differ for each individual based on many physiological factors but Woods could begin chipping and putting, after assessment by his doctors, in three weeks.\"\n\nWoods is not the only one suffering from injuries, with another two in the world's top 10 having faced discomfort in the past few weeks. Compatriot Phil Mickelson, who has won this tournament three times (2004, 2006 and 2010) and is hoping for another victory in another \"even\" year, is recovering from a pulled muscle in his side after pulling out of last week's Texas Open. The world number five, however, is currently competing in the Houston Open where he shot a first round four-under 68. This is the lead-up tournament to this year's US Masters: Mickelson has confirmed his participation at Augusta next week.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Inequality continues to expand partly because of disparities in opportunity in the region.\"\n\nThe International Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde recently stressed the need for a sharper focus on these issues. \"Surely we have all learned by now that it is no longer enough to focus on growth alone,\" she said. \"We need all people to share in rising prosperity.\"\n\nThe ADB unit, which audits the Manila-based bank's effectiveness, has studied progress in half-a-dozen Asian nations (Bangladesh, Mongolia, Papua New Guinea,the Philippines, Tajikistan, and Vietnam) in order to help design new strategies.\n\n\"Developing Asia is still home to a majority of the world's poor. While the proportion of people living below US$1.25 a day fell from 53 per cent in the early 1990s to 34 per cent in the late 2000s, about 70-80 per cent of the world's poor people still lived in developing countries in South Asia or East Asia and the Pacific in the late 2000s,\" said the ADB.\n\nA key finding is that \"ADB financing over the last 13 years has been largely geared toward promoting economic growth, thereby leaving limited support for broadening inclusiveness through greater access to opportunities, and strengthening social protection\".\n\nThe study urges the ADB to \"shift its project design and strategy formulation in both infrastructure and social sector areas, and for both public and private sector operations. Doing so would signify a unique contribution from the ADB to the region's development trajectory\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The answer is yes. Over the past decade, advances in imaging technology has resulted in an increasing use of non-invasive Computed Tomography (CT) X-ray scan to image the heart arteries. Unlike coronary angiography (CAG), CT of the heart arteries not only allows visualisation of the lumen but also allows the wall of the artery to be visualised in any plane and detailed analysis can be performed to assess whether the narrowed segment has soft \"vulnerable plaques\", hardened plaques or calcium deposits.\n\nIt is not uncommon for disease in the same heart artery to be interpreted differently when visualised by different imaging techniques. Extensive diffuse plaque and narrowing of a heart artery with a diffusely narrowed lumen which can clearly be seen on the CT images can appear as an apparently \"normal\" artery with a diffusely small lumen on CAG.\n\nThe usefulness of three-dimensional visualisation becomes more apparent in situations where the CAG shows areas of narrowing alternating with widened segments along an artery, presenting doctors with the dilemma of trying to determine whether the narrower segments represent segments which are narrowed by cholesterol deposits or whether the apparently narrower segments are normal, and the widened segments are actually diseased due to abnormal swelling of the arterial wall, also called \"ectasia\".\n\nThe three-dimensional images from the CT which allow visualisation of the arterial walls will be invaluable in providing the correct diagnosis. Practice guidelines from professional bodies such as the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology have expanded the indications for the use of CT and increasingly, CT is now being used in place of CAG for the assessment of heart arteries. When compared to CAG, the advantages of CT are obvious - it is a non-invasive, less costly outpatient procedure and is completed within seconds. In highly experienced centres, CT is highly accurate and the scan can be completed with low-radiation doses.\n\nIdentifying the functionally significant blockage\n\nIn trying to distinguish narrowed heart arteries which do not result in significantly impaired blood flow to the heart from those which cause significant reduction in blood flow, a new method of assessment was developed to measure and compare the pressure before and after the narrowed segment and the value derived was termed fractional flow reserve (FFR).\n\nThe pressure changes were measured using a special wire with pressure sensors that were put into the heart artery to measure the difference in pressure across the narrowed segment. In 2009, the \"Fame\" study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), using FFR to address the issue of trying to identify narrowed segments which were functionally significant as opposed to just considering the degree of physical narrowing.\n\nThe study compared those who underwent opening of the heart arteries with stents (cylindrical metallic meshes) following CAG with another group which only underwent stenting if the pressure measurements across the narrowing were abnormal.\n\nThe authors concluded that using FFR to select patients resulted in better outcomes in a follow-up after a year. The implication was that using the pressure wire resulted in better identification of narrowed segments that benefited from stenting, and hence decreased stent usage, and this benefit was coupled with better outcomes.\n\nA subsequent study, Fame II, published in September 2012 in the NEJM compared the outcomes of those who had at least one functionally significant heart artery narrowing on FFR who were treated with stents to those who were treated with medication only. The study was stopped early as it showed that stenting provided a significantly better outcome as compared to those treated with medication only.\n\nThe implication of these studies is that those narrowed heart artery segments which were functionally significant will benefit from stents placed into the heart arteries and patients have better outcomes with stents as compared to medication only.\n\nIs the physical or functional significance of heart artery narrowing more important? Should one then decide on the significance of a blockage of the heart artery purely by its functional significance using FFR? In a substudy of Fame published in 2010 in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, of all the heart arteries which had a physical diameter narrowing of 50 per cent to 70 per cent on CAG, 65 per cent were deemed functionally non-significant. For those with diameter narrowing of 71 per cent to 90 per cent, 20 per cent were considered as not functionally significant. Even for those with more than 90 per cent diameter narrowing, 4 per cent were deemed as not functionally significant.\n\nIt will be very difficult to convince any cardiologist that any heart artery narrowing of 80 per cent or more is not significant. If functional significance were the only optimal deciding factor, then those whose treatment was solely determined by FFR should theoretically have excellent outcomes at the end of one year.\n\nHowever, the reality was that for those whose decision to stent their narrowed arteries was based on FFR, after a one-year follow-up, more than 10 per cent of patients developed adverse events including 1.8 per cent death, 5.7 per cent heart attacks, and 6.5 per cent repeat revascularisation procedures. Simply put, FFR failed to recognise the narrowed segments that had \"vulnerable plaques\" which can lead to heart attacks and sudden death.\n\nUsing FFR will result in missing out on narrowed segments which are not functionally significant on FFR but which can be functionally significant during vigorous physical exertion. Compared to FFR-guided stenting, stenting procedures which are guided by CT have shown virtually no heart attacks or death at the one-year follow-up.\n\nUnderstanding heart artery disease\n\nThe definition of a significantly narrowed heart artery segment varies depending on the method of assessment used. Currently, CAG is the \"gold standard\" used for determination of a significant narrowed heart artery although it has several limitations.\n\nThe current data shows that FFR (functional significance) is a better determinant than CAG (two-dimensional arterial lumen assessment) when trying to determine which narrowed artery was significant and required stenting. However, using functional significance by FFR has several limitations including being an invasive procedure, having added cost and a failure to recognise vulnerable plaques. Also, stenting based on FFR has been found to have a high adverse outcome rate during early follow-up (although less than CAG).\n\nStenting based on non-invasive CT assessment (three-dimensional heart artery evaluation) has been shown to be safe and feasible and is associated with an extremely low rate of adverse outcomes during early follow-up.\n\nAre non-significant heart artery narrowings unimportant?\n\nCurrent recommendations and appropriateness criteria for stenting-narrowed artery segments will include most with physically significant (greater than 70 per cent diameter narrowing) or functionally significant narrowing in a major heart artery. However, we do not seem to have all the answers as many women with heart attacks do not have physically or functionally significant heart-artery narrowing. In addition, a large number of heart attacks that are due to \"plaque rupture\" occur in heart arteries that do not have physically or functionally significant heart artery narrowing. While we are getting better at determining those significantly narrowed arteries which will benefit from stents, we have yet to devise simple non-invasive ways to identify those who have non-significant narrowings in their heart arteries but are predisposed to a heart attack.\n\nWhat is certain is that if all the risk factors for heart disease such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, sugar levels and smoking are well-controlled, the risk of a heart attack will be extremely slim. Ultimately, prevention is better than cure and definitely less costly!\n\n(This is the last of a 2-part article)\n\nThis series is brought to you by Heart, Stroke and Cancer Centre.\n\nIt is produced on alternate Saturdays.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However, for now, the company has received enquiries only from small groups of three to five people.\n\nMr Tan said that while business has already declined because of a weaker global economy, he believes the MH370 incident is another reason behind the drop in numbers for combined inbound tours. \"There's a lot of debate online between Malaysians and the Chinese, and the Chinese are saying they won't come to Malaysia again,\" said Mr Tan.\n\nTo assure tourists, Golden Travel Services' managing director, Cindy Chng, has told them that travelling to Malaysia is still safe, that the incident \"should have no linkage with the place itself\".\n\nAlthough there have been no cancellations thus far from Chinese tourists coming in July for combined tours, Ms Chng said that they have expressed some concerns. \"They may not have a good impression of Malaysia and don't want to travel there,\" she said.\n\nShe added that she is open to making changes for tourists if they want to forgo the Malaysia leg of the tour.\n\nWhile CTC Travel does not have combined tour packages, senior manager for marketing and PR Ian Tan said that he expects such sentiments to cause a drop in Chinese tourists coming to Singapore. \"We're pretty close neighbours, and people tend to link us together,\" he said.\n\nBut Mr Tan does not think the impact will be huge. He said that CTC Travel has not been affected much as the company does not have many Chinese customers and focuses more on outbound travel.\n\nTimesworld Travel & Educational Tours and Chan Brothers said that the incident has not impacted combined inbound tours, possibly because they run more corporate and educational tours which could be less affected.\n\nBut Timesworld's director, Cynthia Teo, said that they could face a 10 to 20 per cent drop in demand for the peak season. People are still unsure and are waiting for others to take the first step, she said.\n\nTour operators say that the number of Chinese travellers on combined tours in the upcoming months will depend on how the situation is handled and resolved.\n\nOn social media, several Chinese celebrities have criticised the Malaysian government's handling of the missing plane. Actress Zhang Ziyi said that the government failed to take responsibility while actor-singer Chen Kun said that he would boycott all Malaysia-related products and tours.\n\nWhile the company does not intend to make changes to its tours at this point, SA Tours' Mr Tan said that they will monitor the situation in the months ahead.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Many ordinary life forms around us exhibit their beauty uniquely if you take a moment and allow space for admiration.\"\n\nThe artist's paintings, therefore, depict people going about daily activities that are unique to Singaporean life; for example, finding a seat on a crowded bus and \"ta-pao-ing\" from a hawker centre.\n\nOn the other hand, Wong took a slightly different approach. \"In the city, we always contradict ourselves with our needs and wants. But the beautiful thing is the bond between people.\"\n\nAs such, many of Wong's paintings capture human relationships and the interaction between people.\n\n\"I do not try to see the best in people, but rather to see the real people in them,\" she explains.\n\nFor the exhibition, she opted for oil on canvas as a medium. \"I love the rich texture and versatile possibilities of the medium; it can be thick or thin when applied with different amount of solvent,\" she says.\n\nOn the other hand, to best convey her message to visitors, Quek adopted a traditional ink medium on coloured paper.\n\n\"I use ink in a contemporary context,\" she points out. \"I want to let this medium continue to have a life of its own in modern Singapore.\"\n\nDespite the differences in medium and interpretation, both Quek and Wong came to similar conclusions about modern Singapore society.\n\n\"Singapore is a collage of cultures - from voice to colour, behaviour and language. It's really beautiful and I'm always impressed by our social styles and versatile communication,\" says Wong.\n\nQuek agrees, adding: \"Singapore is densely populated and people keep mostly to themselves. But they share a common identity. They are used to each other's presence, they respect their differences and maybe even embrace them.\"\n\nCity Stories is on display till May 22 at The Fullerton Hotel, East Garden Foyer Gallery (Main Lobby Level).

It would've been better for Europe's self respect and reputation and even more important, for the climate. But we are where we are,\" said Ms Hedegaard.\n\nIn 2012, the European Union started charging all airlines for emissions for the full duration of their flights into and out of the bloc via its Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) but, after complaints from major economies including the US and China, confined application to domestic EU flights only for one year to give the United Nations time to craft a global alternative.\n\nLast September, nearly 190 nations at UN aviation body ICAO agreed to design a worldwide scheme to limit aviation emissions by 2016, but rejected letting Europe apply its own plans in the meantime.\n\nJust weeks after the ICAO meeting, the European Commission insisted Europe was within its rights to regulate within its own airspace and proposed extending the regulation to also cover the portion of international flights over EU territory.\n\nEU member states came out against the plan, fearing it will re-ignite tensions with major trading partners and hamper progress towards the global aviation emissions deal. The EU Parliament has been more divided, with some lawmakers urging Europe not to bow to international pressure and to help hold ICAO to its pledge to ready the global agreement.\n\nMs Hedegaard urged Parliament to back a weakened compromise backed by the national governments to continue to limit the regulation to domestic flights until 2016, which she said would preserve some coverage of the sector and give regulatory certainty to all airlines just weeks ahead of a key deadline. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The estimates by Albedo's management were based on incomplete or unsupported information that could only be obtained from TTS2003, the auditors noted. But the firm was unable to do so as TTS2003 is under the control of the official receiver of Thailand.\n\n\"Because of the significance of the matters described ... we have not been able to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence to prove a basis for an audit opinion,\" said the audit firm. \"Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the financial statements.\"\n\nThe statement by Albedo's auditors comes as investors await further clarity on its RTO deal.\n\nUnder a $1.9 billion deal proposed in August last year, Malaysian tycoon Danny Tan was to inject 13 land parcels spanning 480 hectares in Iskandar into Albedo in exchange for control of the company. This sent the shares of the loss-making steel materials supplier soaring, from a low of 1.1 cents in July to 7.6 cents two months later when the proposed deal was finalised.\n\nBut on March 19, Malaysian news portal The Star Online reported that the deal was off, saying that both sides failed to agree on the terms.\n\nIn one response, Albedo said that its management had met representatives from Infinite Rewards - controlled by Mr Tan - and they requested that the agreement be mutually terminated. For Albedo, its stand was that unless mutual agreement had been reached, the deal remained \"definitive and legally binding\".\n\nAlbedo's shares closed unchanged at 2.8 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Corinne Kerk\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 4, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT'S a nice idea - to wear fashionable clothes that are also environmentally sustainable. Only thing is, these clothes will cost a lot more.\n\nOr will they?\n\nDebunking the myth that fashionable, yet eco-friendly garments are only within the reach of the well-heeled tree-hugger, Swedish fashion company H&M has launched its third Conscious Exclusive collection - a gorgeous range of sustainable fashion that increasing numbers of Hollywood celebrities are seen in.\n\nThis limited edition, 30-piece collection of clothes and accessories is a collaboration with sustainable fashion and design think tank, EVER Manifesto, and inspired by flamenco and Bohemian influences. The clothes are rich in detailing, featuring plenty of embellishments and made with high-quality fabrics such as Tencel (a silk-like renewable material); recycled cotton, polyester and plastic; and organic cotton, silk and vegetable-tanned leather.\n\nThe Conscious Exclusive collection and the lower-priced Conscious collection (made with less experimental sustainable materials) are part of H&M's ongoing efforts to promote economic, social and environmental sustainability - something one doesn't normally equate with high street fashion - but is nonetheless taken seriously at the fashion giant.\n\nAnd best of all, prices are very affordable. Conscious collection pieces range from $14.90 for a men's shirt in 50 per cent organic cotton to $159 for a pair of ladies' sandalette in 100 per cent organic leather. Conscious Exclusive items cost from $17.90 for an organic cow leather rose headpiece to $699 for a 66 per cent organic cotton lace gown. Indeed, H&M is ranked 64 on the Global 100 annual list of the most sustainable companies in the world, and has banned the use of Perfluorinated Compound (PFC) in its clothes since Jan 1, 2013 - the first fashion company to do so.\n\nH&M in February 2013 also became the first fashion company to launch a clothing collection initiative worldwide so second-hand clothes can be re-worn, reused or recycled.\n\nH&M's sustainable fashion has come a long way since its initial appearance back in 2007 when it wasn't even given a name. Today, H&M has a code of conduct stating the requirements it places on all suppliers and their subcontractors for improving working conditions and environmental practices; chemical restrictions, guidelines on the responsible use of natural resources and investments in social projects, among others.\n\n\"Back then, our eco-friendly clothes didn't look like fashion,\" laughs Catarina Midby, H&M's head of fashion and sustainability communication at the recent Conscious and Conscious Exclusive collections launch in Hong Kong. \"But now, we don't have to compromise anymore because the development of sustainable fabrics is just amazing, and we have a Conscious Foundation (to contribute to positive long-term change).\"\n\nDespite keeping sustainable fashion within reach of most consumers, H&M emphasises that this is not done \"at the expense of the employment conditions of garment workers\".\n\n\"The labour cost of producing a garment is just a small part of the general cost of selling it,\" explains Magnus Olsson, country manager, H&M Greater China & South-east Asia. \"We have a lot of experience when it comes to producing garments, choosing the right factories and markets to work with and we buy in large volumes. We have no or very few middlemen in our logistics chain and are very efficient in our logistics and distribution systems. We operate our own stores and are generally very cost-conscious. So there are many aspects of savings in the whole chain.\"\n\nOn top of that, he notes that around 90 per cent of the workers in Bangladesh who make H&M's clothes are earning more than the minimum wage today. And these garment workers are also producing clothes for higher-priced brands.\n\n\"So if we take a long-term view on this, there is no link between prices and labour cost,\" he points out.\n\n\"Sustainable fashion is therefore a good thing to do and it won't affect the price for the consumer.\"\n\nClearly, customers agree, with the Conscious and Conscious Exclusive collections consistently selling out despite not being advertised.\n\n\"We are especially focused on our long-term goal of having all our products come from more sustainable materials by 2020,\" he says, adding that H&M is one of the largest buyers of organic cotton for its general assortment.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Olsson says H&M is \"very happy\" with the \"love affair\" between the company and Singapore, where it currently has five stores. H&M is opening a store at One Raffles Place next month and another at the Sports Hub in the second quarter, where it will offer a broader sports line.\n\n\"The sports collection is fairly new and being developed to become much bigger. The feedback we've got so far is very positive and we try to combine functionality with fashion. We sponsored the Swedish Olympic team in Sochi and will do it also in Brazil for all their off-arena clothing, with some athletes competing in our clothes and helping us develop new lines. We have running, outdoor sports, tennis and general training clothes and we see a big trend. So it's going to be interesting to see how we can present this in the Sports Hub.\"\n\nBoth the H&M Conscious and Conscious Exclusive collections for Spring 2014 will be available from April 10.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The BMW 220i takes over from the old 1 Series Coupe in a renaming exercise that is in line with the German luxury carmaker's philosophy of using odd numbers for sedan models, and even numbers for two-door or coupe-like bodystyles. The 2 Series is a completely new development with an extended body and longer wheelbase to make it long and lithe compared with the shorter and stubbier squarish 1 Series Coupe.\n\nAs a result, this sparkling super-compact coupe looks more like a proper - albeit somewhat downsized - two-door model, rather than the cuter and dinkier 1 Series Coupe. It may not be long (4,432 mm) but its profile is sleeker.\n\nThe 2 Series shares its platform with the current BMW 1 Series hatchback, with the same 2,690 mm wheelbase (up 30 mm from the previous car) but overall, it is 72 mm longer.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The struggling aluminum producer, China's largest, has already turned to the US dollar market twice in the last year to boost a balance sheet that shows short-term liabilities far exceeding its cash position.\n\nWhile overseas investors snapped up those securities at relatively low yields, lured by Chalco's government backing, a new issue would test their belief in the state's support following an unprecedented default in China's domestic bond market last month.\n\nChalco is 38.6 per cent owned by the Chinese government, and were it not for the government's implicit backing, some analysts suggest Chalco could be a strong candidate for bankruptcy.\n\nReports of further defaults among privately owned solar, property and steel companies, however, have raised the question of whether the government will continue to support a company in a struggling industry as it reforms state-owned enterprises and tightens credit throughout the financial system. \"Chalco has been in serious trouble for a few years now. Most of its businesses are losing money,\" said an academic source in Beijing who follows the industry closely.\n\nChalco discussed the potential offering at a presentation arranged by HSBC in Singapore last week, according to investors who attended the meeting.\n\nIssuing perps allows Chalco to perform a common accounting trick that is becoming increasingly popular in China. Debt without a maturity is considered equity, according to International Financial Reporting Standards, boosting Chalco's balance sheet and allowing it to get better terms on its bank loans.\n\nPerps, however, carry no voting rights and typically feature short call dates followed by sharply rising coupon rates, meaning investors treat them as debt. Perpetual bondholders also rank ahead of common equity investors in the event of a liquidation.\n\nChalco is not alone in its struggles to overcome a sluggish global aluminum market, but its situation is certainly severe.\n\nThe company had cash and cash equivalents of 12.4 billion renminbi (S$1.5 billion) at the end of 2013, far less than it needs to cover short-term debt of 47.1 billion renminbi, according to its latest earnings report.\n\nThe company's net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda), a common measure of financial health, was a very high 5.1 with Ebitda of 12 billion renminbi at the end of the fiscal year. Analysts at Huatai Securities expect Chalco's 2014 Ebitda to drop to 2.3 billion renminbi, further pushing up its leverage.\n\nChalco's ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.65 at the end of 2013, with current assets of only 63 billion renminbi paling against current liabilities of 96.7 billion renminbi. A ratio below 1 would signal bankruptcy is near.\n\nChalco said in its earnings report that it would cover that liquidity gap with cash flow generated from operating activities, by rolling over bank loans of 45.7 billion renminbi maturing within the next 12 months and by tapping other financing channels, such as perpetual securities.\n\nStandard & Poor's ranks Chalco's standalone credit profile, which only takes into account credit metrics and excludes implied government support, at BB-, but its issuer rating, the key measure for bond offerings, is BBB-. The three-notch difference reflects the rating agency's view the government would ultimately support the company. - IFR\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLG Electronics shares jump on report of AI chip gear development\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:27 AM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nUS tariffs put spotlight on industrial S-Reits\u2019 upcoming H1 earnings\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM", "images": []}

By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 4, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nALMOST one year after the Jaguar F-Type broke cover with a stunning new convertible, there is now an arguably more delectable alternative - the F-Type Coup\u00e9. Viewed as the spiritual successor to the E-Type, the Coup\u00e9 is both a styling and engineering coup for the British sports carmaker. By giving the F-Type a fixed roof and rear hatch, Jaguar has created a design that is modern and distinctive, yet latently harks back to the 1960s icon. Because depending on the angle of the sun, the F-Type Coup\u00e9 casts a shadow that is uncannily similar to the E-Type silhouette.\n\nLike the all-aluminium F-Type Convertible, the Coup\u00e9's body uses the same lightweight alloy with each side featuring a large single-piece aluminium pressing. There is no centre pillar but Jaguar employs an innovative hydroformed alloy beam to add strength and achieve a roofline low enough to be aesthetically pleasing, yet strong enough to pass a rollover crash test.\n\nThe rear end's elegant window line is matched by the equally attractive tailgate, which tapers down between pronounced rear haunches. Like the Convertible, the boot lid conceals a (shorter) rear spoiler that automatically deploys above 70 kmh.\n\nAnd like the Convertible, the Coup\u00e9 is available with three engine options to drive the rear wheels. There is a 3.0-litre supercharged V6 for both the F-Type Coup\u00e9 and F-Type S Coup\u00e9, producing 340hp and 380hp respectively.\n\nFor the Jaguar F-Type R Coup\u00e9, a 5.0-litre supercharged V8 delivers 550 hp and 680 Nm. With so much power and torque for a 1,665 kg two-seater, the result can be brutal mayhem depending on the driver and road conditions.\n\nDuring this week's media launch in Spain, the flagship F-Type was unveiled with suitably top-of-the-line features. The R Coup\u00e9 has an Electronic Active Differential as standard. EAD improves traction in a corner by transferring torque from one rear wheel to the other and it does so more quickly than a mechanical limited slip differential.\n\nFor the first time, the active diff works with Torque Vectoring by braking, which brakes the inner wheels for even sharper turn-in into corners.\n\nAdaptive Dynamics variable damping is also standard and when Race mode is engaged, the suspension is firmed up and the R Coup\u00e9 turns into a big snarling cat.\n\nFloor the accelerator and it leaps forward with an angry growl, thanks to the Active Sports Exhaust system, which can be turned off if the drone gets to you on long, high-speed jaunts.\n\nBut even without it, the exhaust crackles and pops, with a delicious backfire when you lift off the gas pedal.\n\nSteering wheel-mounted shift paddles can be used to shift the brilliant eight-speed auto transmission manually. This gearbox is so quick and obedient that it doesn't feel like a conventional automatic.\n\nWith torque vectoring, the handling is also tractable and this is demonstrated on a wet handling circuit. Turning late into a corner, the electronics brake the inner wheels to correct the trajectory by \"rotating\" the R Coup\u00e9 around the apex. Unless you're foolhardy, you should exit neatly without running wide.\n\nBut drive recklessly and the torque-loaded F-Type will bite back. Excessive acceleration, especially on a wet road, may cause the tail to swing out if your steering is less than precise.\n\nThe R Coup\u00e9 can also be ordered with Carbon Ceramic Matrix brakes, which are stronger and more fade-resistant than ordinary steel versions. Jaguar has taken several steps to ensure that its CCM brakes also promise a natural brake pedal feel. More importantly, decelerating from breakneck speeds of 250 kmh and above has never felt faster or more reassuring.\n\nTry that once and you will probably agree that the Jaguar F-Type R Coup\u00e9's performance and design are breathtaking.\n\nsamuelee@sph.com.sg\n\nSPECS\n\nJaguar F-Type R Coup\u00e9\n\nEngine\n\n5,000cc V8 supercharged\n\nTransmission\n\n8-speed automatic\n\nMax power\n\n550 hp @ 6,500 rpm\n\nMax torque\n\n680 Nm @ 2,500-5,500 rpm\n\n0-100 kmh\n\n4.2 secs\n\nTop speed\n\n300 kmh\n\nCO2 emissions\n\n259 g/km\n\nDistributor\n\nWearnes Automotive\n\nTel\n\n6378 2626\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It was popular with guests mostly from the UK, Germany, South Korea, Australia and other South-east Asian countries.\n\nFamilies, couples on holiday, students and corporate guests chose hangout@mt.emily as their, well, hangout, when they were in Singapore.\n\nTen years on, owner Cathay Organisation Holdings which runs the hotel decided that it was time for a change. Cathay Organisation also owns hangout@jonker in Malacca. hangout@mt.emily closed late last month, and will reopen after a $2 million revamp in July.\n\nWhile the old hangout@mt.emily was more for the budget traveller, the new one will focus more on the business traveller.\n\nAccording to the latest Singapore Tourism Board's tourism sector performance report, Singapore has seen an overall increase of business travellers by six per cent year-on-year in the first three quarters of 2013, as well as a drop in business travel spending by six per cent.\n\nThe decline in spending has been attributed to cutbacks on corporate travel budgets. Wallet-friendly and chic hotels continue to be in the spotlight for business travellers on a small budget in Singapore.\n\n\"Over the past decade, hangout@mt.emily has cemented its position as a safe, affordable and service-oriented hotel among travellers from all over the world. With an average rate of $130 per room per night, we have seen a steady increase of bookings from corporate travellers as companies tighten their travel budgets,\" says Suhaimi Rafdi, CEO of Cathay Organisation. \"In the last three years, there has been a cumulative growth of 30 per cent year-on-year in the number of rooms booked by corporate guests. With this timely makeover, hangout@mt.emily aims to meet the demand of business travellers who want fuss-free accommodation on cost-saving business trips.\"\n\nhangout@mt.emily prides itself on its signature offering of \"no frills, just fun\" accommodation, and this will still be evident after its rejuvenation.\n\nIt will retain its fun elements such as the use of bright colours, including orange, lime green, pink and fuchsia on its walls and furnishings.\n\nThe facelift will mean adding amenities that go beyond what budget hotels typically offer, such as electronic in-room safes in the 60 private and even in the four dormitory rooms, which is not the usual practice, an increase in the high-speed Wifi bandwidth, universal power points beside each bed, and a pantry.\n\nWith the new overhaul, coupled with its convenient location right next to town, hangout@mt.emily hopes to be the choice accommodation for business travellers who want the best of work and leisure.\n\nDuring the closure of the hotel, hardware amenities will be integrated into the premises. These include refurnished flooring and an enhanced air-conditioning system.\n\nA brand new e-concierge system will also be installed to provide instantaneous convenience where guests can access real-time local information and pre-set functions such as locating the nearest money changers and convenience stores.\n\nFoodies will be happy to note that the popular Wild Rocket restaurant by celebrity chef Willin Low will re-open within the hotel premises when the refurbishment is completed. hangout@mt.emily will begin accepting guests again from July 14.\n\nThere will be a slight increase of rates across all room types. A twin/double room will cost from $130 to $170 when the hotel reopens, as compared to $120 to $150 previously.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The hotel at Bras Basah Road, was bought over by Far East Hospitality Trust last year. Now renamed Rendezvous Hotel Singapore, the 16-year-old hotel now boasts a new look inspired by its location in the arts and cultural district.\n\nInterior design firm, The ID Dept, was tasked to rebrand the hotel to reflect ART - the hotel's Attitude, Retro-listed elements and transformation through Technology, says Arthur Kiong, chief executive officer of Far East Hospitality.\n\nHe adds, \"our hotels draw inspiration from their surrounding locales and the decision to rebrand Rendezvous Hotel Singapore as an art-inspired hotel was an easy one, given its location in the museum planning area of Singapore, and its close proximity to several popular art galleries.\" Mr Kiong declined to reveal the cost of the two-month revamp, but \"guests who are looking to experience creative stimulus will be thrilled to find that our hotel is dedicated to evoking the sense and sensibility of their inner artist.\" The rebranding of Rendezvous Hotel Singapore as an art-inspired hotel means that guests are inspired in all areas, from entering the hotel, dining at the Club Lounge, and in the rooms.\n\nAt the hotel lobby, guests are greeted by changing light scenes throughout the day from the LED panel and floor to ceiling pillar by architectural firm Wow D-Lab. that changes colour from warm orange to a deep blue throughout the day to reflect a change in emotions.\n\nSubtle details in the rooms are also meant to inspire the inner artist in guests. For example, the Club Room's furniture, headboard and wallpaper are designed to reflect influences from the performing arts circle, Peranakan culture and retro-modernist style. In a Performing Arts Club Room, images of iconic Singapore performance venues such as the Esplanade and notable quotes from Oscar Wilde are found on the room walls and headboard respectively.\n\nThe hotel's Club Lounge area also incorporates the use of drapery along the windows to represent an art piece of the vibrant, moving landscape outside the hotel. This landscape is none other than the scenic view of our civic district.\n\nThe hotel's structure and number of rooms, which stands at 298, remain the same. \"We gave Rendezvous Hotel Singapore its new design and art-inspired theme within existing structural elements to preserve the building's rich history and architecture,\" says Mr Kiong. The hotel will be a venue for the upcoming Singapore Chinese Film Festival from April 19 to 27 where the festival's films will be screened at The Courtyard. The hotel will also offer dedicated spaces to showcase collaborations with local art galleries. Guests may not see it, but there are motorised drapes and tracks installed in the hotel lobby and level two gallery spaces to facilitate art and design-related exhibitions. The bodies of work on display will be made available for guests to view and purchase.\n\nAlso in line with its art-inspired identity, the hotel will be launching an anamorphic art programme later this year. The hotel will appoint a Singaporean artist or art collaborative to transform the hotel facade into a visually-stunning anamorphic art piece that reinforces the hotel's identity as a meeting point for art and culture.\n\n\"In a more inconspicuous way, we are already exhibiting the works of students from Raffles Design Institute - the design of our key cards was conceptualised by a group of talented students who won the design competition that we organised,\" says Mr Kiong.\n\nRoom rates begin from $280++.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Bassoli's account of the concert is an eye-opening one as he recalls the eccentric muso fearlessly carrying on with the show despite the concert venue coming under siege as the police and mafia wage very public warfare.

But more than half a year after the rash of leasing plans hit the market, demand has dwindled for a few reasons.\n\nThe first has to do with the Singaporean attitude to car ownership.\n\nThe managing director of a luxury dealership said that with leasing, some people feel that despite paying for the car every month, they still do not own it.\n\n\"So even if cars have become more expensive, most Singaporeans prefer to buy it rather than lease it,\" he said. \"That is also the reason why so many buy property instead of rent, and why freehold is more popular than 99-year leasehold.\"\n\nAnother reason is the lack of tax incentives. \"In some countries, there are tax breaks for leasing,\" said the managing director. \"But not here.''\n\nIn the past, companies which leased vehicles for their employees used to be able to write off the leasing costs from their tax claims, but not any more.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest reason for not taking up a lease is that most people believe that the supply of certificates of entitlement (COEs) will expand in the next few years on the back of an expected increase in vehicle deregistrations.\n\nThe sales director of another luxury dealership said that when the loan curbs were first announced last year, there was \"panic\".\n\n\"Some people ran to leasing because COE premiums were shooting up and financing was tightened,\" he said. \"They were afraid they would not be able to drive a new car again.\"\n\nBut now that the dust has settled, he said, most prospective buyers were less anxious.\n\n\"They plan to keep their cars longer as they wait for more COEs to be released and premiums to eventually fall,\" he explained. Still, the sales director isn't giving up on leasing just yet. He believes that there is potential amid high COE premiums because there are some motorists who cannot wait and need to change their ageing cars soon.\n\n\"For this group of people, leasing still makes sense because they prefer to keep their cash in the bank instead of using it for a downpayment,\" he explained. \"So with a leasing plan, I can facilitate their goal of driving a new car, instead of having to settle for a cheaper car or a used car.\"\n\nHe said that leasing remained a good alternative, even though the monthly payment is \"slightly higher\" than the monthly instalment for a hire-purchase scheme.\n\n\"With a lease, you don't have the hassle of maintenance or paying for road tax,\" said the sales director. \"And you definitely don't need to worry about your resale value three or four years down the road.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Regardless of platform, the subscription revenue goes to mio TV.\n\nThe monthly subscription fee for the Gold Pack is either $64.90 or $69.90, depending on the choice of package.\n\nThose who do not want to be locked into a contract with mio TV will have to fork out more for the World Cup, paying either a discounted price of $88 (without GST) which is available until April 17, or a regular price of $105 (without GST) beyond that date.\n\nIncidentally, this discounted price is the same as the regular price of the 2010 World Cup, then acquired in a joint bid by mio TV and StarHub. Viewers watching the World Cup on either mio TV's or StarHub's platform are eligible for this discount.\n\nThis World Cup pricing and discount applies to residential customers. Packages for business owners will be announced \"shortly\", SingTel said yesterday.\n\n\"Our discounted one-time price of $88 is our way of commemorating the start of our sales with fans, just as we are thanking our loyal football customers for their support by offering the World Cup at no additional charge,\" said Allen Lew, country chief officer, Singapore. \"We want to make sure that everyone is ready to watch once the opening match kicks off, so we encourage customers to order early to ensure timely installation.\"\n\nWhere football is concerned, SingTel is playing a much bigger game, trying to lock viewers into the contracts that offer the World Cup for free as a sweetener.\n\nThe length of the contracts, 24 months, is also roughly about the same amount of time that SingTel has left on its BPL deal, which expires in 2016.\n\nSince at least 2010, SingTel has used football as a crowbar to prise open a market dominated by StarHub. After StarHub lost the exclusive BPL rights to its rival for the 2010-2013 seasons, its customer base dipped.\n\nWhile StarHub eventually recovered from this, viewership slid again, falling by some 15,000 subscribers from December 2011 to its nadir in June 2013, as mio TV swept up other smaller football broadcast rights and strengthened its non-football stable of content.\n\nAfter the regulator ordered SingTel to share its BPL matches with StarHub last August under the cross-carriage rules, the latter's subscriber base finally started somewhat of a recovery. In the second half of last year, StarHub gained 3,000 subscribers from end-June 2013.\n\nBut it is early days yet, and it is unclear if this recovery is sustainable.\n\n\"SingTel's move to provide World Cup content for free to new mio TV and re-contracting users is potentially negative for Starhub as SingTel could potentially gain further market share within the pay-TV market,\" said Citi Research's Arthur Pineda in a report last month.\n\nWhile mio TV's subscriber base is still smaller than StarHub's, the former is catching up at a startling rate. Between 2009 and 2013, the gap between StarHub's and mio TV's subscriber base went from 449,000 users to just 115,000.\n\nLast year, mio TV made significant headway, gaining 20,000 subscribers while StarHub lost 3,000. With mio TV's new World Cup onslaught, the intensity of rivalry between the two operators will only increase. Both operators will have everything to play for, as it were.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The trial took place in January this year and the written submissions of the parties were exchanged and submitted in February.\n\nIn a statement to the Singapore Exchange yesterday, XMH revealed that it is considering its options with regard to an appeal against the decision of the High Court and will announce further updates when there are any material developments. It also confirmed that it will make the necessary provisions for the liabilities under the suit in its full year accounts ending April 30, 2014. \"This claim is expected to have a material impact on the company's financial performance for the financial year 2014,\" the statement said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's pre-camera. It's also very important to architecture because the blueprint machine was developed out of the same process,\" explains Sharma.\n\nShe created the pieces by taking the raw ingredients of biriyani and laksa and putting them through the cyanotography process. The result: an onion sun, yogurt clouds and ground made of rice.\n\nSharma said she drew inspiration for these pieces from her childhood visits to Singapore.\n\n\"I lived in Australia but we went to India once a year. Singapore was always the place that we stopped over and that's when we would get to have the food,\" she says. \"Singapore was a place of transition for me and that went well with my ideas of change and movement.\"\n\nSharma says that transition is a theme that dominates her art. \"It started when I went to Columbia to do my masters. I saw that architecture was changing because we don't just use things like 3-D images; we have animation and film. Architecture is no longer about static space.\"\n\nThe second section of the exhibition captures the idea of change through four collages - each representing one season. \"Even the most technical of architects would have played around with collaging. Taking people and inserting them into pre-images of buildings, that's collaging. We do it with photoshop now but it's the same skill,\" she says.\n\nThe collages also include bits and pieces such as card, foil and wood from Sharma's architectural models.\n\nThe third and final section of the exhibition - memories - is based on Sharma's childhood.\n\n\"I took some photos when I was eight and then went back to the same place this year to take them again. Photography is a huge part of architecture - the photos of the site before and after the project are really important pictures,\" she adds.\n\nLaksa in the Summer of my Childhood runs till June 4 at SPRMRKT, 2 McCallum Street\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Five per cent, however, said that they would not give any raises at all.\n\nThis comes as employers expect to continue to struggle with the double whammy of a manpower shortage and staff turnover, said the report.\n\nNearly half of those surveyed, or 48 per cent, expect professional skills shortages, a six percentage point increase from last year.\n\nSome 53 per cent, meanwhile, say that staff turnover will persist. This is a slight decrease from the 56 per cent that said so last year.\n\n\"While Singapore's employment market will continue to be active during 2014, employers are generally adopting a more considered approach with tighter controls around the recruitment process to make sure professionals are the right fit for their organisation,\" said PageGroup Singapore managing director Jerome Bouin.\n\n\"This approach, coupled with effective retention strategies, will be key to addressing staff turnover and the shortage of talent over the coming year,\" he added.\n\nMr Bouin remarked that the fact that Singapore continues to enjoy an influx of companies looking to establish themselves regionally was likely to help sustain the demand for skilled professionals.\n\n\"This demand is expected to see organisations lean towards hiring local talent as tighter local regulations make it harder to employ foreign professionals. As a result, attraction and retention strategies including offering employee benefits will take greater prominence,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the survey findings, work-life balance options and employee benefits will be offered by some employers this year to retain their staff.\n\nThe top options they listed were flexible working arrangements (63 per cent), team building and off-site activities (46 per cent) and increased maternity and paternity leave (24 per cent).\n\nAnd when it comes to dishing out bonuses as a retention tool, the vast majority of companies indicated they were willing to put their money where their mouth is.\n\nNinety per cent of employers said that they expect to award staff bonuses in the coming year, in addition to training and career progression opportunities.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is about producing the same or more value with fewer workers,\" said Mr Tan, who was addressing business leaders at the Singapore Business Awards (SBA) yesterday.\n\nA critical part of this is in changing individual and societal mindsets. Head honchos must engage and empower their people, and the society \"must stop thinking of manpower as the sole solution\", he said.\n\nCiting the example of automatic car washes which are common in other countries, he observed that in Singapore, with many car owners concerned with scratches on their cars' paintwork, car washes have been replaced by foreign workers.\n\n\"Even if there is available technology to provide a 'swirl' free automatic car wash, we must still shift our mindsets in order for the technology to gain traction in Singapore.\"\n\nMr Tan noted that the electronics sector has moved up the value chain from manufacturing semi-conductors to wafer fabrication of microchips over the past decades. \"Inevitably, some businesses fell away at each step of the way - it was not easy at the time, nor indeed popular, but it has proved to be the right foundation.\"\n\nMr Tan also called on bigger companies and multinationals to guide the way to higher productivity.\n\n\"We hope that MNCs will draw on the innovations and practices from your operations overseas . . . and grow the productivity of your Singapore operations to the level of your most productive global units.\"\n\nAt the awards ceremony at Resorts World Sentosa, Sam Goi, executive chairman of Tee Yih Jia Group, was named the Businessman of the Year for his far-sightedness and entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nHis popiah skin manufacturing firm Tee Yih Jia has been a forerunner in automation, which helped to ramp up its production capacity.\n\nCompared to a stuffy and outmoded factory which produced 3,000 sheets a day by hand in 1977, some 35 million pieces run off its production lines now. The firm exports about 90 per cent of all its products.\n\n\"I realised (when I acquired Tee Yih Jia in 1977) that Singapore's domestic market was limited, and only by exporting to the rest of the world, TYJ could then become a world-leading spring roll pastry manufacturer,\" said Mr Goi, who is also known as \"Popiah King\".\n\nThe same ability to peer into the far horizons of the future similarly distinguished the other winners.\n\nST Engineering CEO Tan Pheng Hock - who was given the Outstanding CEO of the Year accolade - saw an urgent need to diversify its geographical and customer base, as the business, like others, was hit by wave after wave of shock, from the dotcom bubble burst in 2000 to Sars in 2003.\n\n\"These crises were real challenges to us, especially when we were moving from a Singapore-centric company into one with increasing global presence,\" he said. \"But together, as a company, we have ridden out of the financial crises, and we have withstood the shocks to the global business environment.\"\n\nTwo other awards - Outstanding Overseas CEO of the Year, which honours Singaporeans who have made a mark in other countries, and Enterprise of the Year, which recognises promising smaller local companies - were respectively given to McDonald's China CEO Kenneth Chan and Mencast Holdings.\n\nThe SBA, jointly organised by The Business Times and DHL Express Singapore, is Singapore's oldest and most prestigious business award.\n\nAlvin Tay, BT editor and chairman of the SBA organising committee, said that the four winners have demonstrated leadership, vision and entrepreneurial qualities at their best.\n\n\"We salute them and hope that they, together with SBA winners before them, will be like a shining beacon to all aspiring businessmen and entrepreneurs,\" he said.\n\nSaid DHL Express Singapore managing director Herbert Vongpusanachai of the winners: \"A common denomination underlying their successes is constant innovation, which is the only way to compete in the vibrant global marketplace.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the meantime, some stocks are doing well.\"\n\nThe Commercial Affairs Department (CAD), Singapore's white-collar crimebusters, this week launched a wide operation that has so far reached at least seven companies and 11 individuals as part of an investigation into suspected trading irregularities in the shares of Asiasons Capital, Blumont Group and LionGold Corp.\n\nCAD has sought information and data on Blumont executive chairman Neo Kim Hock; Blumont executive director James Hong Gee Ho; LionGold independent director and Ipco International secretary Lynne Ng Su Ling; LionGold director of business and corporate development Peter Chen Hing Woon; Magnus Energy chief operating officer Koh Teng Kiat; Magnus Energy chief financial officer Luke Ho Khee Yong; Innopac Holdings chief executive Wong Chin-Yong; ITE Electric chief executive Ho Cheng Leong; ITE chief operating officer Ang Cheng Gian; ITE non-executive and independent director Goh Hin Calm; and ISR Capital chief executive Quah Su-Yin.\n\nIpco said CAD had also asked it and some of its subsidiaries to provide access to all electronic data and equipment for the past three years.\n\nShares of Ipco and Annica Holdings, a company in which Innopac's Mr Wong was a shareholder as at March 28, 2013, have also been halted pending announcements.\n\nShares of most of those companies fell yesterday if they were not halted.\n\nLionGold was among the biggest losers, falling 17.6 per cent or 2.6 cents to close at 12.2 cents. ITE Electric fell 6.4 per cent, or 0.3 cent, to 4.4 cents before trading was halted.\n\nInnopac lost 6.25 per cent, or a tenth of a cent, to 1.5 cents, while Magnus was down 4.8 per cent, or 0.1 cent, at two cents. Blumont shed 2 per cent, or 0.1 cent, to head out at 4.8 cents. Ipco shares were flat at 1.2 cents.\n\nAsiasons, which took pains to say that neither the company nor its directors and executives had been contacted by investigators, lost 5.2 per cent, or 0.3 cent, to close at 5.5 cents.\n\nInvestors were particularly sensitive to penny stocks that could have been linked to some of the individuals who were subjects of the investigation.\n\nSwee Hong, in which Ms Ng and Mr Chen had been among the 20 largest shareholders in September 2013, fell 7.9 per cent, or 2.5 cents, to 29 cents.\n\nBut Swee Hong management told The Business Times yesterday that Ms Ng and Mr Chen were no longer among the 20 largest shareholders, and stressed that the company and management had not had any dealings with those individuals.\n\nAlthough there was no apparent link between Sino Construction and the companies involved in the investigations, its shares tumbled 39 per cent, or 8.6 cents, to 13.4 cents, drawing a query from Singapore Exchange.\n\nThe company said it was not aware of any undisclosed information that could explain the drop. One trader said the sharp drop sparked unfounded speculation about possible ties to the investigation subjects.\n\nBut the scene just beyond penny lane was much brighter.\n\n\"Blue chips are moving up,\" one broker said.\n\nIndeed, the large-cap Straits Times Index was up 0.85 per cent on the day, at 3,220.06, while the smaller-cap FTSE Catalist index was down 0.7 per cent at 972.96.\n\nInvestor Mano Sabnani said the market had been expecting some follow-up action from investigators following news last year that regulators were looking into the circumstances of October's penny sell-off.\n\nHe noted that a company could be affected if one of its key officeholders got into legal trouble, because of hits to a company's reputation and its strategic plans. But on the whole he did not see the current investigations having a much wider impact.\n\n\"This one is not so major because the size of the market is much bigger now,\" Mr Sabnani said.\n\nOne trader said investors had already priced in most of the risks after October's fiasco.\n\n\"The first time it's really bad, the second time it comes it's not as bad. People get accustomed to it,\" the trader said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/waxing-lyrical-over-vinyls-revival", "site_title": "Waxing lyrical over vinyl's revival", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nWaxing lyrical over vinyl's revival\n\nPassionate indie retailers are expanding, setting up shop in off-beat locations and keeping the record-collecting scene alive against all odds, reports DYLAN TAN\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Apr 3, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSTEP aside, iTunes and digital streaming sites. People are going back to the - record store? The tactile attraction and audio sweetness of the old-fashioned vinyl seem to be finding favour with a new generation of music fans, fuelling a strong comeback of what was once a statement of antiquity.\n\nOn April 19, local indie music retailers will celebrate Record Store Day (RSD) - the Singapore version of the annual event which began in the United States in 2007 and has since spread around the world.\n\nThe premise of RSD is simple - revive the spirit of mom-and-pop record shops and rally against the phenomenon of online shopping, which is partially responsible for putting many of them out of business over the years.\n\nExclusive titles - most on the vinyl format and a handful on CD and even cassette - that are not available online go on sale specially on RSD in select indie record shops, in a bid to lure fans back to brick-and-mortar stores instead of buying at the click of a mouse.\n\nLast year, Vinylicious Records at Parklane Shopping Mall became the first local retailer to bring RSD to Singapore and saw a long queue form outside its doors well before it opened for business.\n\nNeedless to say, it's gearing up to do the same this year and has already started building up hype on its Facebook page. \"This year's RSD is going to be bigger than last year as we are bringing in more than 400 titles compared to 100 titles last year,\" says founder Eugene Ow Yong.\n\nBigger turnout\n\nNot only that, it's also prepared to handle a bigger turnout since expanding to a bigger second store last month. Opened in late 2012, Vinylicious was one of the first full-fledged vinyl music stores to cater to a young, hipster crowd. Before that, only a handful of record shops existed in The Adelphi and catered mainly to older audiophiles.\n\nVinylicious' new 440-square-foot shop will now house up to 4,000 titles - more than twice what it used to carry - to accommodate a bigger selection of blues, jazz, rock and evergreen LPs. Its expansion comes on the back of vinyl staging a strong comeback in recent years.\n\nSales of the format recorded a 10-year high in 2013 and increased 33 per cent year on year, almost on a par with digital streaming services such as Deezer and Spotify (32 per cent). That, in turn, has led to digital music sales taking a hit for the first time ever, dipping by 6 per cent since the Apple opened its iTunes Store for business a decade ago.\n\nVinyl's following is picking up strongly in Singapore with indie retailers such as Vinylicious keeping the record store scene here alive and kicking at a time when big players such as Gramophone and Sembawang Music have folded and HMV has been continuously downsizing. Arguably, it's easier to walk into a music shop selling vinyls rather than CDs these days as they pop up in even the most off-beat locations around the island.\n\nRetrophonic Records, for instance, decided to set up shop in May last year at Chinatown Plaza, a quiet shopping centre just off Duxton. Its sleepy vibe - the mall has very few consumer retail outlets and its tenants are mainly made up of companies using the shop units as offices - did not deter owner Loo Hong Keong, who claims he's not affected by the lack of walk-in traffic.\n\n\"That actually gives me more time to spend with each of my customers as compared to being in a shopping centre where the traffic might be higher but many people are just browsing,\" he says, adding that music lovers tend to be destination shoppers anyway and he boasts that at least eight out of every 10 customers who walk in will buy something. \"There are also many creative agencies nearby so we also attract a good lunch and tea-time crowd.\"\n\nThe 34-year-old, who's better known by his initials HK to his customers, stumbled into the business after he heard a Frank Sinatra record for the first time on a turntable his brother had brought back from Australia in 2011. Calling himself an \"accidental record shop owner\", he started the business in the same Keong Saik Road office where he ran a Web design firm with a grand capital of just $2000, which he used mainly to buy second hand records to resell.\n\nAs things picked up, he acquired a proper shopfront by moving across the street to Chinatown Plaza on Craig Road. He's been turning a profit ever since, thanks mainly to the low risk he incurred with his tiny start-up capital and a unique \"click-and-mortar\" business concept he operates under. Mr Loo explains: \"People order from an online catalogue, pay for it and then come pick it up from the shop a week later.\"\n\nThat way, he doesn't need to splurge on a big inventory - a luxury which he doesn't have to begin with in his shop space which is about the size of an average office conference room - yet at the same time, he's able to offer his customers unlimited titles. He adds that orders are not shipped to his customers because he wants to encourage them to come mingle at his shop - designed to resemble a cosy living room with an armchair in the middle of it, unlike a typical retail space.\n\nWhile Mr Loo is a Malaysian dabbling in the music business in Singapore, one Singaporean has done the exact opposite by setting up shop in Malaysia. Tired of the rat race, Mohd Radzi Jasni decided to retire early and relocate his family across the Causeway in November last year. The former revenue executive and father of one says: \"My wife and I were comfortable - we had good jobs, a house and car - but I also wanted to watch my daughter grow up, which I couldn't when both my wife and I were working.\"\n\nSo he sold everything here and invested about RM50,000 (S$19,200) in Teenage Head Records, which is set to open in the suburban city of Subang Jaya in the Klang Valley of Selangor tomorrow. The idea of retiring in Malaysia attracted the 37-year-old because of the strong Singapore dollar - \"Here, you feel a bit richer,\" he laughs - as well as the booming interest in vinyl over there. He also notes there's a bigger market in Malaysia because of its population of 29 million, and there are only about two proper record shops there.\n\nBut the venture is also a slightly bittersweet one as he will be selling his entire collection of about 2,000 vinyls which he has been collecting since his school days in the 1990s. \"My whole life story is in the shop; I'm selling everything but it's OK because I'll be spending a lot of time in the shop - it'll be like my listening station,\" he says.\n\nCoffee with music\n\nThings are already looking up - Mr Radzi says people have already been messaging him via Teenage Head Records' Facebook page to reserve titles and more than a few curious passers-by tried to enter the shop while renovations were going on. Like Retrophonic, the atmosphere will be kept causal and coffee will be served. \"I've told people to come hang out at my shop instead of Starbucks because the coffee will be cheaper and the music cooler,\" Mr Radzi jests.\n\nLikewise, the one-year-old Hear Records at Burlington Square has been attracting a steady crowd. It's not just because its weekly shipments mean it has the widest range of new releases in town - owner Nick Tan creates a homely vibe at his store, opening it up for after-hours listening sessions and in-store appearances for touring bands. To spread the record collecting culture even further, Mr Tan also frequently collaborates with non-music brands such as Fred Perry and Lomography for exhibitions; and sometimes organises charity events where a portion of the sales proceeds are donated.\n\nHe does it because he says it's all part of the \"giving and sharing\" nature of record collecting. \"Most of us have learnt to take but somehow have forgotten to give back so Hear hopes to build a music/vinyl community that not only cares about chasing after limited edition or rare records but is also committed to awareness of social issues\", Mr Tan explains.\n\nWith his customers coming not only from all over Singapore but also from around the region, Mr Tan has received numerous franchising and expansion opportunities but remains coy about the offers and prefers to concentrate his efforts on growing the local scene first. \"Personally, I think Japan is the best place in the world for vinyl shopping but I think Singapore has the potential to become the second best in Asia,\" he explains.\n\n\"The local vinyl scene is definitely bigger than it was a year back; some veterans have even called this wave the biggest vinyl bull run in the last 20 years,\" he observes. \"If we can continue to offer a good range with attractive prices, then we will be able to continue attracting music lovers from here and around the region; and build a sizeable crowd to sustain this new wave and the future of the local music retail scene.\"\n\ndylantan@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/human-perspective-occupation", "site_title": "A human perspective of Occupation", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nA human perspective of Occupation\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Apr 3, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWE are all familiar with the horror stories about the Japanese Occupation of Singapore - whether from textbooks, museums or first-hand stories from those who lived through it. We are often told the Japanese were oppressors who staked babies, shot men and raped women.\n\nIn Rising Son, a play by Cultural Medallion recipient Dick Lee, all these truisms still very much exist, but they are carefully sidelined to make way for a different perspective - one that is refreshingly human and relatable.\n\nThrough the play, Lee questions: What if you had lived through the war, and personally met an honourable Japanese soldier who was none of those things? What if he brought your family food when he had too much, and lent you books because you had access to none? Would you befriend him and risk being shunned as a Japanese sympathiser? Or refuse his kindness and risk his wrath?\n\nThat was the predicament faced by 18-year-old Peranakan boy Sunny Lee (Tan Shou Chen), when a straight-faced Japanese army lawyer named Hiroyuki Sato (Caleb Goh) moves in to the house next door. Not only did he have to juggle a reluctant friendship with Sato, he had to somehow protect his headstrong and almost two-dimensionally naive sister, Ruby Lee (Seong Hui Xian), from being taken by the foreign stranger.\n\nWhile the war goes on, the three seem to live in an alternate universe, dealing with issues that almost seem inconsequential. But only almost. Instead, the wrestle with their star-crossed fates serves as a reminder that daily life still goes on even in times of peril.\n\nPerhaps it was Lee's knack for romanticising scripts, or it was a result of being based on the true story of his now 92-year-old father, but by the end of the 90-minute Rising Son, it had effectively evoked sympathy for Sato - not a soldier but a man who was far away from home. For the Lees, their torment may have come from the gunshots and falling bombshells, but for Sato, his torment showed in the quiet moments like when he taught Sunny about Japanese haiku and reminisced about his home near Mount Fuji.\n\nJust as Sato had given Sunny a different perspective of the war, one of \"respect, hope and poetry\", this is what Lee's play gives his audiences as well - a reminder that war does not choose sides, but instead makes victims out of everyone involved.\n\nRising Son runs until April 12 at the DBS Arts Centre - Home of SRT, at various timings.

And, especially in Singapore's context, investors should not be too focused on the amounts paid to executives, but should instead assess how those amounts reflect accountability, the experts and executives said.\n\nThose comments were made at the launch of the Singapore Scorecard, which found that Singapore's 100 largest publicly listed companies by market capitalisation better adhered to major governance principles in 2013 from 2012, but still lagged Thailand and Malaysia.\n\nDBS Group Holdings, OCBC Bank, Singapore Exchange (SGX), Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) and Singapore Telecommunications were the best-ranked. The survey was carried out in six South-east Asian countries, and executed in Singapore by the Singapore Institute of Directors (SID) and the National University of Singapore Business School's Centre for Governance, Institutions and Organisations (CGIO).\n\nThe scores comprised two components - the first reflects how well companies fulfilled key governance principles, and the second awards or deducts points for surpassing or missing standards.\n\nOn average, the assessed companies scored 71.7 overall out of a maximum 142, or just over 50 per cent of the highest possible score. But there was a wide variance in how the different companies fared, with the lowest score coming in at 46.8 and the highest score at 105.\n\nLooking at the core component alone, Singapore companies scored an average of 65.1 out of a possible 100, coming in third behind Thailand and Malaysia.\n\nMohd Sani bin Mohd Ismail, mission leader for Asean capital market integration for the Asian Development Bank, said in a speech that the purpose of the regional assessment was to improve the branding of the region to attract investments.\n\nHe noted that even though there is as yet no \"Holy Grail\" link between governance and profits, there is strong confidence that governance means better operations.\n\nBut he also urged executives and companies to remember the \"human element\" behind governance. Problems that arise because of weak governance can affect the lives of innocent multitudes, he said.\n\n\"An investor who uses savings to invest in a company may be greatly affected if investments in the company nosedive,\" he said in a prepared statement.\n\nWith Singapore's Code of Corporate Governance now requiring companies to reveal remuneration details for individual top directors and executives, discussions also turned to recent findings by an SID survey that found most companies unwilling to do so.\n\nDBS chief executive Piyush Gupta argued against disclosure on competitive grounds.\n\n\"We don't do that, but we've debated it actively,\" Mr Gupta said. \"There's a very small hiring market in Singapore. The talent pool in our industry is very small. The vulnerability that I will expose myself to by putting the compensation of my top five executives out for public scrutiny is very high. Given the turnover and attrition in my industry, it's not a risk I'm prepared to take.\"\n\nRichard Teng, chief regulatory officer at SGX, noted that being too focused on dollar amounts may be missing the forest for the trees. What investors fundamentally need to see is how those amounts are tied to performance.\n\n\"If you look at fundamental corporate governance principles, it's not about disclosure of your top five executives' pay. It's always about accountability,\" Mr Teng said, adding: \"It's how do you align the interest of shareholders with ... management to drive the longer term performance and results of the company?\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The London-based auctioneer, which opened its Singapore office in February amid a burgeoning Asian collectors' market, is setting the pace in the specialists' market, said its Singapore director Bernadette Rankine.\n\nShe said: \"Last year, Bonhams achieved a host of new world records, with a series of art records in London, Paris, New York, Hong Kong, Sydney, San Francisco and Los Angeles. World records were achieved for old-master paintings, jewellery, Russian art, Indian and Islamic art, Chinese art, contemporary African art and collectors' cars.\"\n\nRare blue diamond\n\nLast April, at its fine jewellery sale in London, Bonhams sold an extremely rare fancy deep blue diamond weighing 5.30 carats for a record price of US$1.8 million per carat.\n\nThe previous world record price per carat for a blue diamond was US$1.68 million, bought by Graff Diamonds, the international diamond house headquartered in New Bond Street.\n\nThen in November, a Bonhams sale of Chinese art in Hong Kong produced a world record for a single-owner collection of Yixing stoneware, with a price of \u00a34.1 million (S$8.6 million) achieved.\n\nMs Rankine said Bonhams leads in 10 key areas of the UK auction market, including antiquities, arms and armour, watches and clocks, motor cars, European ceramics and Japanese art. \"It is unrivalled in motoring - achieving world record prices for Mercedes, Alfa Romeo, Maserati and Aston Martin,\" she said.\n\nLondon HQ refurbished\n\nThe secondary-sale market has proven so good that the company just refurbished its New Bond Street headquarters to the tune of \u00a330 million. The facility has a state-of-the-art saleroom meant to set the standard for auctioneering.\n\nThese standards will be upheld in Bonhams' new Hong Kong saleroom, to open next month, said Ms Rankine, who holds a post-graduate diploma in Asian art from the School of Oriental and African Studies, and was one of the first directors of Opera Gallery in Singapore.\n\nBonhams, set up in 1793, holds its own in the auction market through the nimbleness of its teams, she said. For example, it was the first auction house to resume fine wine auctions in April 2008, after the abolishment of the wine duty in Hong Kong.\n\n\"That was followed in quick succession by the sale of rare single malt whisky in November 2009 and vintage cognac in May 2012. Today, Bonhams is the only auction house in Hong Kong offering fine spirits for sale on a regular basis and with great success,\" she added.\n\nIt also goes off the beaten auction track, becoming the first to hold a camera auction in Hong Kong in 2012; this November, it will sell a collection of Leica cameras.\n\nThe South-east Asian market has registered tremendous growth year on year, which is why Bonhams opened a Singapore office - to take the lead in this phenomenal growth, she said.\n\nuihoon@sph.com.sg\n\nBonhams will hold its spring preview at The Regent Singapore on April 11-12. On display will be Asian 20th century and contemporary art, fine and rare wines, cognac and single malt whisky, fine jewellery and jadeite, modern wristwatches and fine Chinese paintings.

We want to provide comfort to the families and we will not rest until answers are indeed found,\" Mr Najib said, as he thanked those involved in the eight-nation search.\n\nDespite extensive scouring of the remote southern Indian Ocean off Perth, no debris that would indicate a crash site has so far been found, with time running out to locate the plane's \"black box\" which only emits signals for around 30 days.\n\nMr Najib admitted the exhaustive hunt for the Boeing 777 that vanished on March 8 was a \"gargantuan task\" but said he was confident the baffling disappearance would be solved.\n\n\"I am very confident with the level of professionalism . . . that indeed in due time we will provide a closure to this event, on this tragedy,\" he told a press conference.\n\nKuala Lumpur's response has been widely criticised, especially by distraught relatives of the 153 Chinese nationals aboard.\n\nMr Najib left without taking questions, as a reporter called out a query about Malaysia's handling of the crisis.\n\nAdding to the frustration for families affected, Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said on Wednesday that a criminal investigation into what caused the flight to veer from its intended route between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing had so far been inconclusive.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said that the current search was the toughest ever. \"Every day, working on the basis of just small pieces of information, we are putting the jigsaw together. And every day, we have a higher degree of confidence that we know more about what happened to this ill-fated flight.\n\n\"It is a very difficult search, the most difficult in human history, but as far as Australia is concerned, we are throwing everything we have at it.\"\n\nSince the plane disappeared nearly a month ago, eight nations, many of whom do not normally work together, have rallied to help track down clues to one of the greatest aviation mysteries the world has seen.\n\nBoth Mr Najib and Mr Abbott hailed the \"truly remarkable\" cooperation between Australia, Britain, China, Japan, New Zealand, Malaysia, South Korea and the United States.\n\n\"It shows what we can do and if anyone would ever be unhappy or distraught about the prospects for international peace and harmony, this operation is a marvellous antidote to pessimism,\" said Mr Abbott.\n\nA British nuclear submarine with underwater search capabilities reinforced the hunt on Wednesday, joining planes and ships scouring the vast oceanic search zone, but again nothing was reported found.\n\nAustralia's Joint Agency Coordination Centre, which is directing the search, said that eight planes and nine ships were involved yesterday as they further refined the search area, moving it to west-north-west of Perth.\n\nAustralia's Ocean Shield naval vessel, which is fitted with a US-supplied \"black box\" detector, is due to arrive in the area today. But without a confirmed crash site, hopes of finding the device are slim. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

It will be the world's first museum to focus on the research and exhibition of South-east Asian art from the 19th century onwards.\"\n\nNever before has an institution in the region comprehensively and systematically taken stock of the century-long artistic wealth of South-east Asia. The Singapore Art Museum has played a role in championing regional art since its inception in 1996, but its focus has mostly been on contemporary art.\n\nThe National Gallery Singapore, on the other hand, will expand that focus. With more than 18,000 sq m of gallery space set aside within two heritage buildings - the previous City Hall and the former Supreme Court - it will be able to put on show more than 700 works within the permanent galleries alone.\n\nMr Wong added that the Gallery will receive $21 million to assemble its collection, out of the $62 million set aside by the government last year to build and manage a National Collection of art over a period of five years.\n\nThe DBS Singapore Gallery\n\nOne of the permanent galleries was on Wednesday renamed the DBS Singapore Gallery, after the bank donated a record $25 million, which will be matched dollar for dollar by the government from the Cultural Donation Matching Fund.\n\nThe DBS Singapore Gallery will present works from as far back as 19th century Singapore from artists like Dora Gordine, to mid-20th century works by Liu Kang and more recent contemporary pieces by Lee Wen.\n\nThe South-east Asia Gallery will feature works from regional artists like Phra Sorakaklikhit (Thailand) in the 19th century, Nguyen Gia Tri (Vietnam) in the 1940s and Nasirun (Indonesia) in the 2000s.\n\nWith museums commonly seen as arbiters of taste in the art world, the opening of the National Gallery Singapore, coupled with its focus on Southeast Asian art, is bound to have its impact on art collectors as well.\n\nDr Eugene Tan, its director, declined comment on the potential ripples it might create in the art market, but said: \"National Gallery Singapore aims to capture the artistic spirit of Singapore and South-east Asia.\n\n\"By showcasing the development of our region's art within a global context, we seek to be a leading visual arts institution that inspires and engages our people and our neighbours, creating a dialogue between the art of Singapore, South-east Asia and the world.\"\n\nThe National Gallery Singapore will open in October 2015 with its permanent exhibitions.\n\nrachloi@sph.com.sg\n\nOpening hours will be from 10am to 7pm daily, and 10am to 9pm on Fridays and Saturdays.\n\nAdmission to the DBS Singapore Gallery and the South-east Asia Gallery will be free for citizens and permanent residents.\n\nLog on to\n\nwww.nationalgallery.sg\n\nfor more information.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The package includes tax breaks for small firms, and accelerated shanty town renovations and railway investments in the less-developed areas out west.\n\nAnalysts mostly welcomed the announcements, which are in line with previous interventions supporting economic activity. They say that in the short term, the measures will infuse oxygen into the economy without stalling reform, while maintaining growth at a level which satisfies Beijing's need for social stability.\n\nMost of the measures, already in the annual economic work plan announced last month, largely serve to reassure markets and ensure that growth does not fall to below the 7 per cent threshold. First-quarter data to be published on April 16 could shake markets, which are already nervous about the state of the world's second-largest economy.\n\nQu Hongbin, the head of economic research for investment bank HSBC, said: \"Beijing's policymakers are responding rapidly with concrete policy measures to support growth, exactly as we have expected. This means policymakers don't want to take the risk of seeing growth slipping to below 7 per cent.\"\n\nChina's economy grew 7.7 per cent last year, unchanged from the year before; it was the most sluggish growth recorded since 1999. During the annual parliamentary session, Prime Minister Li Keqiang put the growth target for this year at \"about\" 7.5 per cent, leaving the government some leeway on either side.\n\nBut data published since the start of the year hints that China could miss its target; already, many economists have placed their estimates for the full-year at below 7.5 per cent. China witnessed its first major bond default last month, and analysts expect more to come as the central bank seeks to end decades of cheap, under-utilised credit.\n\nLast November, China's leaders unveiled a plan for an overhaul of the economic system, with reforms ranging from the opening up of markets to the dismantlement of state monopolies, but economists warn that shifting the economy to a more consumption-led model will sacrifice jobs and growth as the industrial system upgrades and weeds out over-capacity and cheap manufacturing.\n\nMr Li last month said that employment remained a priority, suggesting that there was only so much growth he was willing to give up. Last year, the government implemented similar measures to support investment in key areas, but these were suspended after a few months. Wednesday's measures were thus widely anticipated by economists.\n\nAnalysts say that the difference this time lies in the funding channels provided. The State Council said that the government will sell 150 billion yuan (S$30.53 billion) in bonds this year to help build railways. The authorities will also set up a development fund of 200 billion to 300 billion yuan a year to widen sources of rail financing. The China Development Bank will create a body with an independent budget to sell housing bonds in support of revamping shanty towns and urban infrastructure projects. The vehicle will seek funding from financial institutions such as the Postal Savings Bank of China, commercial banks, social security funds and insurers.\n\nMr Qu said: \"This is not quite a repeat of previous occasions, when China stimulated growth. Reform is part of the policy-support measures. The financing reforms should help establish a long-term, sustainable funding channel for these much-needed infrastructure projects; it should help keep infrastructure investment - now at around 18.5 per cent - at a steady pace.\"\n\nAnalysts say that giving the government's policy banks a bigger role in infrastructure and social housing investment will take the burden off local governments, which are already saddled with debt. The move is also consistent with the need to reform government financing.\n\nMr Qu said: \"These measures should help China to stabilise growth in the short term.The impact should filter through towards the end of the second quarter. We remain comfortable with our 7.4 per cent full year gross domestic product forecast.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It was a sign, decades in the making, that this city's efforts to create a thriving residential real estate market in its downtown core were starting to look more like a box-office hit than a flop.\n\nAn estimated 12,000 people live in downtown Cleveland, double what the population was in 2000, according to the Downtown Cleveland Alliance, a nonprofit organisation that represents property owners. Rental occupancy is near a record high of 95 per cent.\n\nSuch growth has roots in initiatives that Rust Belt cities like Cleveland and Detroit are using to lure residents, including tax credits, business incentives and outreach to professionals looking for affordable and bike-friendly city living.\n\nBut in Cleveland there's a more marquee reason people are moving downtown: the theatre. PlayhouseSquare, a nonprofit that operates nine performance spaces in Cleveland's theatre district, has run its own real estate services division since 1999.\n\nWith last fall's opening of Residences at Hanna, Playhouse Square took its first step into the world of residential real estate, an unusual project for an arts organisation that is usually more concerned with renewing subscriptions than leases.\n\nThe worlds of theatre and real estate merge in several ways. In New York, performing arts organisations often benefit from mixed-use development. In 2012, off-Broadway's Signature Theatre moved into a multivenue complex on the ground floor of the MiMA building on West 42nd Street.\n\nRegionally, theatres are landlords out of necessity; they lease or own apartments and other housing for out-of-state actors and crew members. Live-work spaces for artists are commonplace.\n\nResidences at the Hanna is anchored on the ground floor in part by the Hanna Theatre, which was built in 1921 and once attracted stage luminaries like Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda. Today it houses the Great Lakes Theater, a company that produces classic works. Rents there range from US$750 for a studio to US$1,600 for a two-bedroom.\n\nMr Hawley, a jewellery designer, says he pays US$1,275 for a 925-square-foot, one-bedroom apartment with unobstructed views of Lake Erie.\n\nAll units in the eight-storey building were leased before the project was completed in October. As with many other new buildings downtown, there's a waiting list to get in.\n\nToday PlayhouseSquare manages more than 2.3 million square feet of office and retail space in north-east Ohio. Nearly half of that is in the PlayhouseSquare district, which includes five historic theatres, dating to the 1920s, that after decades of neglect were renovated as part of a 27-year, US$55 million campaign of public and private funds.\n\n\"We are creative, and that carries over to how we create a neighbourhood,\" said Allen Wiant, the vice-president for strategic development in the theatre group's real estate division.\n\nCredit a musical for the original effort to redevelop PlayhouseSquare. In 1973, a production of the musical revue Jacque Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris that was to run for two weeks became a hit and ran for more than two years. That success brought people downtown and renewed interest in saving Cleveland's historic theatre district.\n\nPlayhouseSquare realised that filling theatre seats on a regular basis required restaurants and bars nearby, where people could come before a show and stay after.\n\nFast-forward a few decades. PlayhouseSquare officials viewed the eight floors of the Hanna annex, which include the theatre and several floors of former office space, as an adaptive reuse opportunity.\n\nThe K&D Group, a regional developer behind other downtown apartment buildings, bought the annex for US$3.25 million from PlayhouseSquare's real estate division. As a component of the transaction, made public on Dec 29, 2011, PlayhouseSquare agreed to lease the ground floor for retailing, situated near the Hanna Theatre, from K&D for a period of years.\n\nAlmost 40 years after the closing of Jacque Brel, and after millions of dollars in renovations and area development, people are not just being entertained in Cleveland's theatre district. They're calling it home.\n\n\"A logical evolution is residents,\" said Joe Marinucci, the chief executive of the Downtown Cleveland Alliance and a former vice-president for real estate development for PlayhouseSquare. \"That creates more of a 24/7, dynamic environment.\"\n\nPlayhouseSquare is also in the middle of a US$16 million transformation of the surrounding streetscape, with new signs, gateway arches and the renovation of a small commons featuring a food kiosk called Dynomite.\n\nOn May 2, the organisation will hold a lighting ceremony for its new, retro-looking electronic signage and a gigantic LED crystal chandelier that will hang over an intersection near the theatres. In addition, two new restaurants will be opening in the next several months.\n\n\"It's not just about what's on stage,\" said Art Falco, the president and chief executive of PlayhouseSquare. \"It comes down to creating a vibrant area, too.\"\n\nMr Marinucci said that until occupancy exceeds 20,000, downtown is \"still short\" on the number of people needed for a truly round-the-clock neighbourhood with significant pedestrian traffic. Amenities like drugstores and supermarkets are still lacking downtown, although Heinen's, a local grocery chain, plans to open a 33,000 sq ft supermarket this fall some five blocks away from the Hanna as part of the renovation of a former bank building.\n\nDespite the positive turnaround in its theatre district, Cleveland continues to face serious economic hurdles. A recent study from the Brookings Institution found great income inequality in Cleveland, with the poor getting poorer. Neighbourhoods just outside downtown, like Fairfax and Hough, the site of riots in the 1960s, show few signs of revival.\n\nBut PlayhouseSquare's residential project may provide a model for other struggling Rust Belt cities that are eager to find the synergy that links the performing arts, urban development and affordable commercial real estate.\n\n\"The basic rule in real estate for 5,000 years is value is tied to location,\" said Robert Lynch, the chief executive of Americans for the Arts, a nonprofit arts advocacy organisation in Washington. \"Whenever you can do something that enhances a location, you enhance the value.

That's compared to a peak of 13,000 condos sold in Ho Chi Minh City in 2010.\n\n\"We've still got issues that are holding us back,\" Richard Leech, Hanoi-based executive director of CBRE, said on Wednesday. \"Although we have had economic stability, there is a lack of confidence, a fear that interest rates are going back up.\"\n\nFirst-quarter home sales reflect difficulties in a property market where entire sub-divisions on city outskirts remain unfinished and empty, Mr Leech said.\n\nThe economy continues to be stymied by bad debt at banks, of which a third were tied to soured property loans at the end of 2012.\n\nLenders are putting together a loan package to stimulate the property market and policymakers cut interest rates last month to bolster growth.\n\nThe central bank last May approved 30 trillion dong (S$1.79 billion) of financing for five banks to use for low-interest home loans, yet few homebuyers have participated in the programme, Mr Leech said.\n\nLast month, a group of banks including BIDV Securities, Agribank Securities, Bank for Foreign Trade of Vietnam and Vietnam Bank for Construction announced a plan to offer a total of 50 trillion dong for property loans, according to Vietnam News.\n\nThe World Bank estimates the economy will grow 5.4 per cent this year, a seventh straight year of growth below 7 per cent. The central bank last month cut its policy rates and said that it's stepping up efforts to create more favourable conditions for foreign investors, including a plan to auction bad-debt assets of banks.\n\nPolicymakers are also weighing a proposal that would make it easier for foreigners to buy homes in the country.\n\nDeclining home values hurt Vietnamese sense of wealth, Adam McCarty, Hanoi-based chief economist at Mekong Economics, said. When that drops, people reduce their spending, which ripples across the economy, he said.\n\n\"Most people's wealth is tied up in real estate,\" Mr McCarty said. \"They are seeing their wealth go down on paper about 30 per cent in the last few years. A lot of people have debts. There is a lot of stagnation.\"\n\nJust a few years ago, ordinary Vietnamese were \"gambling\" on apartments, putting down deposits with plans to resell the units in a month or two, he said.\n\nWhen the market slumped, they could not sell the homes, Mr McCarty added.\n\nSome pockets of the housing market are seeing improvement, particularly vacation properties along the central coast and upscale condominiums in the centres of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, Mr Leech said.\n\nForeign investors are showing more confidence in Vietnam's market than domestic buyers, he added.\n\n\"The confidence is with the foreigners,\" he said. \"Foreign developers are sniffing around.\"\n\nVietnam has drawn international real estate companies, including CapitaLand and Mapletree Investments.\n\nPrices for condominiums in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City were generally little changed in the first quarter with no recovery expected this year, Mr Leech said.\n\nStill, Vietnam will be better off in the long-term with a slow recovery, he said.\n\n\"I like this slow return which slowly builds confidence,\" Mr Leech said. \"This is much more sustainable.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

And so his retelling of the story of Noah's Ark is far removed from anything you may have learned in Sunday school. It is loosely (very loosely) based on the biblical version but when it comes to apocalyptic visions, fire and brimstone and the mother (or Father, in this case) of all deluges, Aronofsky may have the edge.\n\nNoah, his epic tale of the greatest flood on earth and the man assigned by God to reboot the human race, is big, bold and way over-the-top, going well beyond the boundaries of standard revisionist fantasy. As a work of cinematic art however, the film has its kick-ass moments, with impressive spectacles of computer-generated hordes (both animal and human) on the move, an ark of, um, biblical proportions and a larger-than-life portrayal of Noah by Russell Crowe.\n\nTo borrow a phrase from an old football coach, the Book of Genesis is not just about matters of life and death - it's far more important than that. Because Noah's story resonates across different major religions, Aronofsky's film was always likely to confuse, alienate and possibly offend both believers and non-believers alike (it's been banned in several countries).\n\nIn the same way that The Passion of the Christ (2004) controversially brought imagined scenes and non-biblical elements to the big screen, Noah, with a script by Aronofsky and Ari Handel, will be criticised by purists for taking liberties with the source material but well, that's why creative licence (and a disclaimer at the start) is the prerogative of directors and movie studios.\n\nWay before Moses, Abraham and Jose Mourinho, Noah is The Chosen One and his mission in life is somewhat weightier than say, winning the Champions League. Aronofsky's symbolism-filled film includes stylised scenes of The Creation and picture-perfect landscapes and begins with a snake (effective in 3D) in the Garden of Eden before moving on to Noah - a man with a direct line to heaven.\n\nThe end of the world is nigh and the Creator will punish Mankind for its multiple sins, which include rape and pillage and (in a nod to environmentalists) stripping the land of precious minerals. Noah (Crowe) has been tasked with saving innocents (animals only) from the coming apocalypse. It's a massive burden for one man but he's the right guy for the job and he takes to the task with zealous enthusiasm.\n\n\"The storm cannot be stopped, but it can be survived,\" says Noah, knowing that his wife and family are the only others with tickets to a new life. There are to be no exceptions - it will be painful, but it will be just. Noah's lack of compassion bothers wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly) and second son Ham (Logan Lerman), who frets that he won't be able to start a family of his own. Oldest boy Shem (Douglas Booth) has already hooked up with Ila (Emily Watson), a girl who has lived with the family from young.\n\nThe film's overall mood is sombre but Noah's grandfather Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins, made up to look not a day over 900) adds a welcome note of levity to the proceedings, imparting some Yoda-like words of wisdom to the family and an undisguised craving for berries.\n\nThere are times when Noah resembles a summer blockbuster more than a serious portrayal of a complex man, especially when the Watchers - fallen angels in the form of unwieldy rock-encrusted monsters (voiced by Frank Langella and Nick Nolte) - play significant roles in the action. There's also a major heavy (a descendant of Cain played by Ray Winstone) who turns Ham against his father and isn't squeamish when it comes to depleting the ark's animal stock.\n\nThere will be blood and destruction in Noah, and a fair amount of anguished theological debate (most of it one-directional) as well. This modern-day interpretation of an ancient death-by-water parable will provoke debate of its own but Aronofsky makes no excuses for the path he chooses. Noah doesn't always make sense but it succeeds in engaging the senses in a way few movies do - and that's a good thing.\n\nRating:\n\nB-\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The ruling reversed a federal appeals court.\n\nWriting for the court, Justice Samuel Alito said that the ruling wouldn't necessarily preclude suits in all 50 states. He said that Minnesota law would have improperly imposed obligations on airlines no matter what was in their frequent-flyer contracts with passengers. He said that frequent flyers wouldn't be left \"without protection\", even in Minnesota. \"If an airline acquires a reputation for mistreating the participants in its frequent-flyer programme (who are generally the airline's most loyal and valuable customers), customers can avoid that programme and may be able to enrol in a more favourable rival programme,\" Justice Alito wrote.\n\nThe passenger, S Binyomin Ginsberg, contacted Northwest's offices 24 times over seven-and-a-half months, according to a 2008 letter sent to him by the company, which is now part of Delta Air Lines Inc. The letter said that nine of the complaints concerned delayed luggage and that Mr Ginsberg repeatedly asked for compensation above the airline's guidelines.\n\nMr Ginsberg, a rabbi who says that he flies 75 times a year because of his work as an education and administration expert, had achieved the highest level in Northwest's WorldPerks frequent-flyer programme. The WorldPerks membership agreement gave the airline the right, in its \"sole judgment\", to revoke the membership of passengers who abuse the programme.\n\nThe case turned on the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act, which bars lawsuits or state regulations that are \"related to a price, route or service of an air carrier\". In 1995 the Supreme Court said that that law barred state-imposed regulations while letting passengers sue over contractual commitments made by airlines.\n\n\"Today's decision gives airlines greater freedom to act in bad faith in performing their contracts with consumers, to the detriment of the millions of consumers,\" said Mr Ginsberg's lawyer Adina Rosenbaum of the Washington-based advocacy group Public Citizen.\n\n\"The Supreme Court affirmed that airlines may control the terms and conditions of their frequent-flyer programmes, including the conditions for maintaining membership in a programme,\" said Victoria Day, a spokeswoman for Airlines for America, the trade group for US carriers. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM\n\nNissan poised to offer record-high coupon in US$4 billion bond sale\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:03 AM", "images": []}

From just 10 films at the inaugural edition last year, this year's line-up has grown to 30; while the number of invited filmmakers and panel speakers will increase from nine to 15.\n\nOrganised by the Singapore Film Society and SIM University's Centre for Chinese Studies, the SCFF will run on April 17-27. Highlights include Chinese director Jia Zhangke's violent crime flick A Touch of Sin, which is unofficially banned in China; Hong Kong director Kiwi Chow's surrogacy drama A Complicated Story, which stars Canto pop crooner Jackie Cheung; and Cantonese teen movie The Way We Dance, which was a sleeper hit back home in Hong Kong last year.\n\nThe bigger line-up will help in showcasing the diversity of Chinese cinema in terms of genres, territories, content and even languages as works from all around the region including Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and China are being featured, says David Lee, director and co-founder of the festival. He adds that all the films will be screened in their original languages instead of being dubbed so it's a rare treat to watch a Hong Kong production in Cantonese.\n\nA retrospective has also been added to the programme and this year's will pay tribute to King Hu, the Hong Kong director best known for his classic wuxia (martial arts) films. Eight of his works, including Dragon Inn which has been remade by Tsui Hark twice, will be shown.\n\nIn addition, a Chinese short film showcase and a documentary segment are being introduced with last year's Golden Horse Best Documentary winner, Beyond Beauty: Taiwan From Above, headlining the Documentary Vision section.\n\n\"We recognise documentary filmmaking as a wave sweeping across Greater China and experiencing extraordinary commercial success in Taiwan, while maintaining a strong independent voice highlighting social causes and struggles in China, Hong Kong and even Malaysia and Singapore,\" says Lee, about including talkies in the SCFF's line-up. \"I am gratified to see the diverse developments of Chinese cinema, which is good for cultural development, and that is what the Singapore Chinese Film Festival aims to do - to promote good quality cultural cinema to the audiences here.\"\n\nFor full line-up and ticketing info, check\n\nwww.facebook.com/sgchinesefilmfestival\n\n, or visit\n\nwww.sfs.org.sg/scff\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The firms were Innopac Holdings, ITE Electric Co, Ipco International and ISR Capital.\n\nThese firms are connected through a web of complex cross shareholdings and common directors - past and present - to Asiasons, Blumont and LionGold. Annica Holdings, a firm majority owned by Indonesian businessman Edwin Sugiarto and also linked to these firms, was halted from trading pending an announcement.\n\nThere was nothing light about the CAD's touch. The Business Times understands that several individuals were questioned and one was arrested and placed on police bail.\n\nOnly Asiasons put out a note to clarify that the CAD did not come knocking on its doors. Asiasons shares, which were on trading halt for the the first half of the day, closed 5 per cent lower at 5.5 cents.\n\nAsiasons-linked firms and several broking firms were not as lucky, though. Market sources revealed that the CAD team had \"visited\" several broking houses and walked away with computers and hand-held devices belonging to remisiers, possibly to pore into the trading details of those being investigated.\n\n\"The message is that the regulators will not tolerate flagrant violations of the rules,\" said remisier Alvin Yong.\n\nYet there is some disenchantment that this could have happened sooner. \"It is about time, after so many months,\" remarked an avid investor.\n\nThe investigation comes six months after the Monetary Authority of Singapore and Singapore Exchange (SGX) revealed that they were extensively reviewing trading in these three stocks that had tumbled and wiped out billions of dollars over just a few days.\n\nBut there may have been good reason for the time taken, said a legal expert. \"It is likely that preliminary investigations have already been done and the authorities think they now have prima facie evidence to proceed further,\" he said.\n\nSimilar to the notices sent out on Wednesday to Blumont, LionGold and Magnus Energy, the firms involved in the latest sweep were asked to hand over all corporate electronic data from January 2011 until now, and information technology equipment and data storage services belonging to several individuals and subsidiaries.\n\nInnopac, an investment holding firm that counts Blumont and Ipco as shareholders, said CAD had asked its CEO, Wong Chin-Yong, to give access to relevant data and documents. \"The board understands that these CAD investigations may be protracted and there is no certainty of an outcome,\" said Innopac in a note to SGX.\n\nInnopac shares fell 6 per cent to 1.5 cents before trading was halted about half an hour after the market opened.\n\nCatalist-listed ITE Electric, part-owned by Blumont, joined the fray. It said CAD was seeking data on the firm's CEO and largest shareholder, Ho Cheng Leong, chief operating officer Ang Cheng Gian and non-executive, independent director Goh Hin Calm and wholly owned ITE Assets.\n\nNot spared was ISR Capital, majority owned by Asiasons, which said the regulator had on Wednesday sought information of its CEO, Quah Su-Yin, five wholly owned entities and two funds managed by its subsidiary.\n\nOnce-upon-a-time market darling Ipco, which owns 6.6 per cent of Blumont, said it and four subsidiaries - IPCO Constructors, Friendship Bridge Holding Company, Nueviz Investment and Sino Gas Holdings - were also being investigated.\n\nMeanwhile, construction firm Swee Hong clarified that LionGold's non-executive independent director Lynne Ng Su Ling and employee Peter Chen Hing Woon - the two are also under CAD's investigations - were no longer in the firm's top 20 largest shareholder list as at March 25.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He also has an aversion to germs but his big weakness is women - specifically female portraits by famous masters - a weakness that often results in a clever con where he deliberately undervalues an item so that his buddy Billy (Donald Sutherland) can bid for it on his behalf.\n\nThe signal for Billy to buy something is when Virgil utters the phrase \"the best offer\", which also happens to be the name of this clunky, uninspired thriller-drama, written and directed by Giuseppe Tornatore (Cinema Paradiso). Virgil spends most of his free time alone at home admiring his extensive collection, which is tucked away in a hidden room behind an impressive shelf lined with of dozens of gloves. For years, Virgil has dismissed Billy's own painterly ambitions. \"You have to look for the inner mystery in artworks,\" he says.\n\nVirgil's well-ordered world is turned upside down when he is contacted by Claire (Sylvia Hoeks), a mysterious young woman who asks him to value the contents of her dilapidated family villa, now that her parents have passed away. She keeps cancelling appointments but Virgil's curiosity is piqued, especially since the home is filled with antique treasures. Oddly, he keeps finding small mechanical parts - like the pieces of an incomplete puzzle - scattered around the villa.\n\nHe brings the parts to Robert (Jim Sturgess), a young gadget repair wizard who informs him that the parts belong to a vintage automaton. He begins to assemble the android and also imparts relationship advice to Virgil, who is a newbie at romance but is intrigued by his newest client. Claire is heard but never seen, thanks to a severe case of agoraphobia that necessitates her avoiding humans.\n\nVirgil eventually draws her out of her shell but it's not long before it's he who comes under her spell, besotted like a schoolboy and gifting her evening gowns and expensive jewellery. When she has a panic attack and can't be found, he becomes an emotional wreck.\n\nThe sets and the artworks are beautiful but The Best Offer is too long drawn and far too predictable to qualify as an engaging thriller. It has Hitchcockian aspirations but while Rush is convincing as a man on the verge, the material itself lacks substance. \"Human emotions are like works of art - they can be forged,\" says Billy. Unfortunately, this uninteresting work can be spotted a mile away.\n\nRating:\n\nC\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Capitol Investment Holdings, the consortium for this project, gave updates on the mixed development yesterday during the topping out ceremony. It is a joint venture between the Kwee family-backed Pontiac Land Group - which owns a 50 per cent stake in the JV - as well as Perennial Real Estate Holdings (PREH) (24 per cent) and OSIM CEO Ron Sim (26 per cent) in his personal capacity.\n\nThe mixed development lies at the junction of Stamford and North Bridge roads, which spans Capitol Theatre, Capitol Building and Stamford House - all of which have conservation status.\n\nCapitol Investment Holdings director Kwee Liong Seen said yesterday that the Capitol Theatre will be \"reinstated to its formal glory with 900 comfortable seats to provide patrons with an exciting cinema and theatre experience\".\n\nCapitol Theatre was built in 1929 and screened its last movie in 1998. To preserve the style of the theatre, the developers kept and restored three distinctive architectural decorations.\n\n\"The extensive restoration works undertaken, coupled with the new state of the art facilities that will be put in place, will endorse Capitol Theatre's status as one of the finest performing arts and cinema venues in Singapore,\" said Pua Seck Guan, vice-chairman and president of PREH.\n\nThe theatre has an advanced rotational floor system which will allow innovative staging of performances. Its independently movable seat platforms can be transformed from a stepped floor with seats into a flat floor within minutes making it possible for conventions or gala dinners to be held there.\n\nCapitol Theatre's opening act Singapura The Musical will be staged by The 4th Wall Theatre Company, which will centre on the struggles of Singaporeans and of former minister mentor Lee Kuan Yew as they built the nation.\n\nAfter two years of laborious research, the musical production is in its final stages, Mr Pua said. He also said that he hopes to position the retail mall distinctively with international brands, flagship stores and new-to-market concepts to target the upper to mid-tier market, given the competition from other shopping malls in the vicinity.\n\nMore details on the retail mall will be out in two to three months' time, he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We encounter it first at home with our siblings, then in school with our friends, and later on with our colleagues when we are deemed old enough to join the \"rat race\". The stress from it causes health issues and even ruins relationships, but we hardly bat an eyelid, because we've all accepted that competition is necessary on the route to success.\n\nBut author Margaret Heffernan begs to differ. \"The theory is that competition produces a wide diversity of products and choices,\" says the 59-year-old, who has been the CEO of at least five different companies as well as an entrepreneur and a writer.\n\n\"But the psychology doesn't bear that out at all - it says if you want to kill people's creativity, put them into a contest. Because in a contest you're going to be focused on a narrow goal. So your ability to think broadly in a free way is hugely constricted,\" she explains.\n\nTo argue her point that competition does more harm than good, Heffernan has recently released a book titled A Bigger Prize, which talks about the many circumstances where competition produces perverse outcomes.\n\nShe brings up the example of Arup, a structural engineering company that designed the Marina Bay Sands integrated resort and the Beijing (Bird's Nest) National Stadium.\n\nIts organisational hierarchy is very flat, she says, so sometimes the bosses work under people more junior than them just because they want to contribute to a project and make it more successful.\n\n\"Every employee owns a part of the company, so they help one another because it benefits them too. It's not because you have lots of super extraordinarily smart people, it's because everybody's willing to share everything they know,\" she explains.\n\nIt's not that they aren't competitive people too - after all, it's a part of human nature. It's just that they limit it to less important things, like a contest within the office to see who could design and build the tallest Jenga tower, reveals Heffernan with a chuckle.\n\n\"It was a great structural engineering problem, and boy, their Jenga towers were incredible. And it proves they do have competition, but for trivial things just because it's fun and creates excitement. It's not the ethos of the company.\"\n\nAccording to Heffernan, her theories apply especially in a fast-paced society such as ours, where competition is so ingrained that we often don't want to risk \"losing out\" by lending a hand to others.\n\nIt won't hurt though, she argues. \"Giving people credit for their help won't cost you. And helping others, that won't cost you either. It will just mean you'll have a better network, a better reputation and more access to information. And you'll also be a nicer person - that definitely doesn't hurt.\"\n\nA Bigger Prize\n\nBy Margaret Heffernan\n\n$31.95 before GST\n\nAvailable at all leading bookstores in Singapore\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was the highest M&A value recorded during the start of any year since Mergermarket started compiling the report in 2001.\n\nThe largest deal in the region was made in China with Shanghai Jinfeng Investment's US$10.6 billion acquisition of real estate group Shanghai Greenland (Group) on March 18. This was followed by Belgian brewery Anheuser-Busch InBev's US$5.8 billion acquisition of South Korea's Oriental Brewery in January. Singapore also featured in the list of largest deals as Temasek Holdings' recent acquisition of a 24.95 per cent stake in Hong Kong-based AS Watson & Co from Hutchison Whampoa for US$5.7 billion was the third-largest deal in the region in the first three months of this year.\n\nAccording to the M&A intelligence firm, the real estate sector contributed the largest chunk to this record-breaking value of businesses changing hands, helped largely by the Shanghai Jinfeng Investment deal. M&A deals involving real estate companies reached US$19.7 billion, forming 19.4 per cent of the total M&A pie during the period in the region, far from the US$1.3 billion it contributed over the same three months last year.\n\nWith both the Anheuser-Busch InBev and Temasek deals in this space, the consumer sector also did well with US$16.3 billion of deals recorded, more than 2.5 times the US$6.2 billion last year. Technology, media and telecommunications sectors posted a 53 per cent increase from last year with US$12.7 billion worth of deals compared to the US$8.3 billion last year.\n\nThe other key sectors recorded smaller deal values than in the same period of last year: Energy, Mining and Utilities managed US$17.9 billion compared with the US$22.2 billion last year; Industrials & Chemicals chalked up US$9.4 billion of deals compared with US$15.1 billion last year; and Pharma, Medical & Biotech scraped US$2.5 billion of deals, against the US$3.5 billion in 2013.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The last time Noble shares were trading around $1.30 was back in October 2012.\n\nUnder the deal announced on Wednesday, the purchaser will pay, on completion, an initial US$1.5 billion for the stake in Noble Agri Ltd (NAL). The final amount to be paid would be equivalent to 1.15 times 51 per cent of the audited book value of NAL for the 2014 financial year. At the end of 2013, NAL's audited book value was US$2.8 billion and net debt was US$2.5 billion.\n\nUsing the initial payment and the FY2013 audited book value as a guide, the deal values the business at around the US$3 billion mark.\n\nThe deal would release capital currently invested in the loss-making business, significantly improving Noble's credit profit and financial metrics.\n\n\"We estimate Noble's residual net debt will be reduced to just around US$1 billion . . . , a significant positive from a credit perspective,\" said Jefferies Singapore analyst Abhijit Attavar, who has pegged a new target price of $1.50 a share on Noble.\n\nFitch Ratings agreed that Noble will be able to deleverage significantly if it completes the proposed stake sale.\n\n\"Furthermore, it may no longer need to consolidate NAL's debt as it may treat NAL as an associate following the sale. Noble reported that NAL's net debt was around US$2.5 billion at end-2013. This suggests a potential to reduce Noble's net debt, which stood at US$5.7 billion at end-2013, by up to US$4 billion,\" the credit rating agency said.\n\nIt added that Noble's ratings momentum will depend on the return it obtains in the deployment of the sale proceeds and clarity on its eventual leverage level following the completion of the deal, which faces regulatory hurdles from anti-trust bodies in multiple countries.\n\nOCBC Investment Research noted that, on a pro-forma basis, the stake disposal would have contributed some US$302.8 million to Noble's FY2013 bottom line.\n\nDBS Group Research analyst Ho Pei Hwa noted that assuming the deal had been completed by end-2013, Noble's book value would have been lifted from US$5.16 billion to US$5.25 billion and net profit from US$243 million to US$546 million.\n\n\"This translates to group ROE (return on equity) of 10 per cent versus the actual 4.7 per cent. The non-agri ROE would have been at an astounding 24 per cent if we strip out US$377 million agriculture losses and US$2.8 billion book value.\"\n\nMs Ho has a buy call on Noble and a 12-month price target of $1.53.\n\nMr Attavar added that the deconsolidation of the agribusiness into a joint venture will bring into sharper focus the high ROE of Noble's two core businesses - energy and metal trading.\n\nAnalysts liked Noble's asset-light strategy, where the trading group does not have to own upstream assets as long as it can secure the off-take.\n\nNoble said the resultant joint venture will be Cofco's principal base for sourcing food materials globally, which effectively combines Noble's broad origination base and pipeline and risk management capabilities with Cofco's leading access to the Chinese consumer.\n\nThe strategy is not entirely new to Noble, which had, in the past, partially sold out of a capital-intensive asset while retaining an associate interest, thereby simultaneously securing production off-take for that asset while boosting ROE as in the Gloucester-Yancoal coal deal.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/chinas-stimulus-test-reform-resolve", "site_title": "China's stimulus a test of reform resolve", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nChina's stimulus a test of reform resolve\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Apr 3, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nCHINA has responded relatively swiftly to a perceived crisis in its economy that caused stocks to plunge to multi-year lows two weeks ago. The authorities unveiled a mini-stimulus package on Wednesday night to prevent the economy from decelerating too fast, even as it pushes ahead with reforms to deflate its debt excesses and liberalise its financial system. Markets cheered the move. But attention is likely to return to China's bad debt problem, which is expected to worsen as more companies default.\n\nWhat is striking about the latest measures is how limited they are in scope while meeting three critical needs: promoting social equity, preserving jobs, and spurring demand-boosting urbanisation. Borrowing hundreds of billions of yuan to build railways will create jobs, spur consumption and promote urbanisation by further linking up the less-developed central and western regions. Bigger tax breaks for small businesses will give relief to those facing cashflow problems and struggling from a lack of available credit. Small businesses are critical in providing jobs, and they need all the help they can get as the economy slows. Spending more to clean up slums and upgrade poorer and more rundown urban areas will be good for Beijing's image. It is all too aware of the need to manage a growing middle-class population disillusioned by soaring inequality, food scares, environmental problems, a lack of opportunity and entrenched corruption.\n\nThe latest stimulus is relatively restrained compared to the four trillion yuan (S$813 billion) package rolled out following the global financial crisis in 2008. Policymakers might have more tricks up their sleeves to buy themselves time even as they tackle bad debt. More money can be spent cleaning up pollution or building more subways. With unemployment at just over 4 per cent, there is room for slower growth. More importantly, China is not excessively indebted to the world, so it is not in danger of foreigners pulling the plug. Investors justifiably worry whether China's banks will go bust from their exposure to bad loans. As the economy slows, more borrowers will be unable to repay their debts. But there is always scope for a glass-is-half-full approach. Investors should not underestimate China's capacity to effect a soft landing. Instead of worrying about whether growth this year is 5, 6 or 7 per cent, investors should assess whether policymakers will stick to their reform plans when the going gets tough.\n\nThe Third Plenum policy meeting last year produced a raft of well-received proposals on free markets, migration, land and the financial sector. Reforms are picking up pace. A crackdown on corruption has caused alcohol and luxury goods sales to plummet. Private capital is being allowed into the energy and healthcare sectors. China's first corporate bond default has already happened, making companies more risk-averse. The central bank has made clear that the days of cheap interbank funding are over, while injecting liquidity when things get too tight. A bank run in Jiangsu last week was calmed after a show of force by regulators to reassure depositors that their cash was safe. This will be a challenging year for China, but as with all reforms, it's better late than never.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It features 10 paintings on paper, a couple of wall murals, and some installation works including live mushrooms and orchids growing on metal frames.\n\nGaribaldi attributes his interest to his childhood when he lived close to the border of Jakarta, and would often go trekking through nearby forests in search of new trees and plants just out of curiosity.\n\nIt was while mushroom-hunting in those forests that he discovered his love for how everything is so connected in the natural world, such that even what we cannot see with our naked eye is still essential to our existence.\n\nHe expresses this in his colourful acrylic paintings, where his depiction of individual organisms is based on the actual microscopic view, but re-interpreted as elements in his imaginary \"micro-universe\".\n\nBut he hastens to explain that it's not about germs per se, but how they fit into the bigger picture, ie, the world around us.\n\nUltimately, Garibaldi says: \"My message is for people to think about how they interact with nature and the environment. Because especially in urban life, people forget how they fit in with trees and plants. They need to be reminded that nature is, and always will be, important in our lives.\"\n\nAbiogenesis: Terhah Landscape runs till May 31 at Pearl Lam Galleries at 9 Lock Road, Gillman Barracks.

The market outlook needs to be positive before we start seeing more en blocs being successful,\" Mr Singh said.\n\nOrangeTee's Ms Li thinks the current investment climate and stringent total debt servicing ratio framework, which lower the loan-to-value limits for buyers looking to buy additional residential properties, will make it \"extremely challenging to find a buyer at this price level\".\n\n\"There is still substantial supply along Grange Road in terms of new projects, some of which have not been launched. The number of unsold units in the vicinity is also a concern for potential buyers.\n\n\"On top of that, if the developer is not able to sell all the units in the development within five years, they will also be hit by ABSD. The risk will be too much to bear unless current cooling measures are relaxed.\"\n\nShe feels that the more palatable en bloc quantum currently is about $100 million.\n\nMeanwhile, Knight Frank said it will soon begin discussions with the US government, to whom the site will revert back to as freehold land, after its 99-year lease, started in 1991, ends.\n\nKnight Frank's Mr Loh declined to reveal further information, bound by non-disclosure agreements signed and the political sensitivity of the topic, he said.\n\nThe notice sent to residents said Knight Frank has up to one year (i.e. before March 22, 2015) to find a buyer and file an application to Strata Titles Board.\n\nBefore the site is launched for sale by tender, there will be an owners' meeting to provide information on the sale proposal and the sale process, it also said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Attention has focused on the flight's captain, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, and first officer Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, as Malaysia believes the plane was deliberately diverted by someone on board.\n\nBut no evidence has emerged to suggest a motive by either of the men, who appear to have been well-regarded by their peers.\n\nIGP Khalid said that police had recorded more than 170 statements so far. \"This investigation is ongoing. There are still more people we need to interview,\" he said, according to Dow Jones, declining to provide further details while the probe was under way.\n\nThe Boeing 777 disappeared on March 8 shortly after take-off on an overnight flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Malaysian police and FBI experts were examining a flight simulator assembled by Capt Zaharie at his home, hoping to find some clues.\n\nBut IGP Khalid said that he was still awaiting feedback from experts examining the simulator, adding that so far nothing conclusive had emerged.\n\nA multi-nation search for wreckage from the plane is under way in the Indian Ocean after Malaysia said that satellite data indicated it may have gone down there. A British nuclear sub with underwater search capabilities reinforced the Indian Ocean hunt. Britain's Royal Navy said that the first submarine in the operation - HMS Tireless - has arrived in the area and \"with her advanced underwater search capability will be able to contribute to the attempts to locate the missing plane\". - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Noble will have a 49 per cent stake. The move will result in an agribusiness joint venture between the two parties.\n\n\"Noble Agri's supply chain management system and origination capabilities complement Cofco's logistics, processing, and distribution network in China,\" Cofco's chairman Frank Ning said in a statement.\n\nNAL handles the broad spectrum of Noble's agriculture business from sourcing to processing and marketing of various commodities including grains, oilseeds, vegetable oil, cotton, cocoa, coffee and sugar in over 90 countries.\n\nAgribusiness generated US$15.5 billion revenue for FY2013, accounting for about 16 per cent of Noble's total revenue of US$97.88 billion.\n\nThe final amount to be paid will be adjusted such that when the deal is completed, it would be equivalent to 1.15 times 51 per cent of the audited book value of NAL for the 2014 financial year.\n\nBased on NAL's audited book value of US$2.8 billion for FY2013, the agreement values Noble's agribusiness at US$3.22 billion. As at Dec 31, 2003, the NAL group had a net debt of US$2.5 billion.\n\nA consortium of investors led by China-focused private equity firm Hopu will join Cofco as minority investors in the acquisition and will hold a third of the investment vehicle that is making the purchase.\n\nHopu was set up by Fang Fenglei, the chairman of Goldman Sachs Group Inc's Chinese securities venture. Noble's chief executive officer, Yusuf Alireza, who joined the Hong Kong trader from Goldman Sachs in 2012, will head the operation in the interim. Mr Ning will be chairman and Richard Elman, founder and chairman of Noble, will be deputy chairman.\n\nNoble said the proposed sale is consistent with its asset-light strategy to partner with industry-leading players in each of its platforms to build world-class businesses and leverage the use of its capital base.\n\nIf successful, Noble said the estimated gain from the sale is US$64.80 million.\n\nMr Elman said that with the financial and business support of the new partners, the company will accelerate the execution of its strategy.\n\nIt plans to use the net proceeds of US$1.49 billion to repay debt and for general corporate and working capital purposes, as well as to be redeployed across the group's other platforms.\n\nNomura estimated that Noble shares could be worth S$1.90 each before the 51 per cent stake sale.\n\nYesterday, Noble shares jumped as much as 5 per cent to end at a 52- week high of S$1.255. More than 116 million shares changed hands. The benchmark Straits Times Index ended 5.74 points lower, or down 0.18 per cent, at 3192.78.\n\nSome analysts noted that the deal compares to the 1.4 times seen in the tender offer made last month by Temasek for another Singapore-listed commodities group, Olam. However, Mr Foulger told FT that the Cofco/Noble valuation took account of the operational benefits that the Chinese company would bring to the business, while Temasek's was \"purely a financial investment\".\n\nSince 2011, Noble, which is 14 per cent owned by sovereign-wealth fund China Investment Corp, has been planning to carve out its agriculture business and list it in Singapore, but credit-rating issues, cotton-trading losses and the sudden resignation of its then chief executive Ricardo Leiman, after less than two years on the job, weighed on the IPO, valued at US$700 million at that time.\n\nCofco and Noble still need to obtain regulatory and shareholder approval for the deal.\n\nNoble was advised by JP Morgan Securities (Asia Pacific).\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

New gas-fired plantings - spurred by availability of global gas shipments at the new Singapore LNG terminal - saw total registered generating capacity here spike 14.9 per cent to an all-time high of 12,422 MW last year.\n\nThe price drop was also helped by lower high-sulphur fuel oil prices last year - the latter being the price which piped gas purchased from neighbouring Indonesia and Malaysia is pegged to. \"For the first time since the market started, total generation supply - the amount of electricity that is actually offered in the National Electricity Market of Singapore (NEMS) - crossed the 7,000 MW mark. Electricity consumption, on the other hand, increased by only 2.4 per cent compared to 2012,\" said Mr Wong.\n\n\"There was also considerable movement in the market share of market participants and generation technologies, as this demonstrates healthy competition in the NEMS.\"\n\n\"The retail market also saw an interesting development,\" he added, in that - apart from SP Services, which is the supplier for all non-contestable consumers - Keppel Electric displaced one of the top three electricity retailers here which had consistently held their positions since 2004.\n\nEMC's 2013 market report said that deducting the registered capacity of 12,422 MW in the market from the total licensed capacity in 2013 \"gives an indication of a potential 13.1 per cent additional, or 1,627 MW of incoming capacity\". \"The majority of this is expected in the next two years.\"\n\nGas-fired plants here have also supplanted older, less-efficient oil-fired steam plants, the report said. While power supply by the former grew 13.2 per cent last year, that from the latter dipped 8.7 per cent from 2012, and fell below 500 MW for the first time. (Recent EMC numbers showed that the gas-fired plant share of power supplies here surged to above 97 per cent this year.)\n\nOn power market performance, \"two of the three leading gencos had significant reductions in their market share in 2013\", EMC said. Tuas Power's market share fell by the largest extent, dropping from 25.2 per cent in 2012 to 19.5 per cent last year. That of YTL PowerSeraya also fell, marking \"the fourth consecutive year of declining market share for the genco, whose share dropped to 23.2 per cent\". Senoko Energy held steady from 2012, with the genco continuing to hold the largest market share of 27 per cent.\n\n\"With a net fall among the three largest gencos, the market share was picked up mainly by the embedded generators and Keppel Merlimau Cogen. Most significantly, the market share of the embedded generators tripled from 1.2 per cent in 2012 to 3.9 per cent in 2013,\" EMC noted, with the latter referring to in-house cogen plants of big consumers such as ExxonMobil and Shell.\n\nExxonMobil recently said that it was building a third cogen plant here to power its growing manufacturing complex here - its largest worldwide - while Singapore Refining Company has also started building its cogen facility.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This decline was steeper than that in total traded value as March 2014 had one more trading day than a year earlier.\n\nCompared with February, securities' traded value was 14 per cent higher in March while daily traded value was up 9 per cent. This was because March had one more trading day than February - March had 21 days of trading, whereas February had 20.\n\nSome market analysts were not surprised by this decline in trading on SGX, given its relative performance to the US markets.\n\n\"Since the fourth quarter of last year, volume of trading on the SGX has been declining, due mainly to the underperformance of the local market against the US market. This further explains the lower trading volume in March,\" said Kelvin Wong, chief technical strategist at Asia City Index.\n\nMr Wong also attributed this decline partly to the proposed regulatory changes to SGX, particularly those measures targeting uncollateralised contra trading. \"The contra rule has had some impact on penny stocks as it has helped siphon off some of the liquidity from the market.\"\n\nOn a positive note, he believes that there are signs that securities trading should bounce back soon. \"Going forward, the volume should start increasing as we recently saw that Nasdaq fell by almost one per cent. Also on the opening week, about two Mondays ago, the local market rebounded strongly.\"\n\nNoting how the Straits Times Index (STI) tracks the Hang Seng Index closely, Mr Wong reckoned that with more funds coming to Asia, especially the Chinese market, there will be a direct positive impact on the STI.\n\nYesterday's monthly report did show some positive trends, though. A total of 40 bond listings raised $17 billion in March, an increase of 13 per cent from the previous year, with the largest bond issue being the US$1.5 billion note from Mizuho Financial Group.\n\nIn addition, SGX saw continued growth in commodity activity in March, while derivatives activity held steady.\n\nIron ore futures volume nearly doubled to 91,086 contracts in March from February. The volume of cleared iron-ore swaps rose 88 per cent year on year to 69,710 contracts, while volume of cleared iron ore options was 14 times that of a year earlier at 9,755 contracts. On a year-on-year basis, Sicom rubber futures volume grew 61 per cent to 39,649 contracts.\n\nDerivatives volume was steady at 9.5 million contracts with a daily average of 463,811. On a month-on-month basis, total trading volume rose 18 per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Hang Seng Property Index of nine company stocks closed 3.7 per cent higher, the most since Jan 19, 2012, while the benchmark index was up 0.3 per cent.\n\nChief Executive Leung Chun-ying said on Tuesday that the government won't extend a pilot programme to reserve homes for local residents, part of a package of measures aimed at cooling prices in the world's most-expensive housing market. Prices fell 4.1 per cent in the past year, after more than doubling since 2009, as higher sales taxes and downpayment requirements were imposed.\n\n\"Although we do not view the chief executive's comment as a signal of actual easing, we believe the market will take a different view in light of the current cheap valuation of the Hong Kong property stocks,\" Barclays plc analysts led by Paul Louie said in a note yesterday. \"It is fair to say that the housing market is no longer overheating.\"\n\nThe value of home sales in Hong Kong fell to HK$20.6 billion (S$3.35 billion) in March from HK$27 billion a year earlier, Hong Kong Land Registry said on its website.\n\nMr Leung in September 2012 announced a plan giving only citizens the right to buy apartments at some sites built by private developers to ensure local needs are met. China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd won tenders for two sites under the policy in June last year.\n\nSuspending the policy would ensure that the housing supply target set by the government will be met, as adding the condition into land sales would cut demand from developers, the Barclays analysts said.\n\n\"When we launched this pilot scheme, we said we would only use it in an overheated market,\" Mr Leung told reporters on Tuesday. \"If we need it in the future, we can launch it in a short period of time.\"\n\nSylvia Wong, a Hong Kong-based analyst at UOB Kay Hian Ltd, said setting aside the plan won't have any impact on the market, though she expects the curbs to stay in place as they were needed to keep the housing market in the current state.\n\n\"No one expects the curbing measures to get tougher,\" she said yesterday. \"The question is when they will ease.\"\n\nDevelopment Secretary Paul Chan told lawmakers yesterday that the policy hasn't been shelved, but there isn't an urgency to promote it now, according to Radio Television Hong Kong. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

So you could say that my paintings might have received some influence from shared subculture.

But over the years, given the absence of elevators, they hauled bricks, furniture, water tanks - and even barbecue equipment - up 27 flights of stairs to build a home.\n\n\"I never lived in an apartment before.

This will, however, hinge a fair bit on the Chinese economy, which has shown signs of softening in manufacturing and new export orders, IATA warned.\n\nThe 2.9 per cent growth registered by the global market was lower than the 4.3 per cent expansion achieved in January, but IATA noted that the fundamental drivers of air freight remained \"broadly positive\"; it suggested that the slower clip was likely due to \"temporary factors\".\n\nGlobal capacity rose by 2.3 per cent, pushing the load factor up to 44.8 per cent.\n\nFor the first two months of this year, global cargo traffic chalked up a robust 3.6 per cent gain overall, outpacing the mere 1.4 per cent growth last year as a whole, when a lacklustre business environment put a dampener on cargo demand in the first half of the year.\n\nIATA said in its Air Freight Market Analysis that although the outlook for air freight remained broadly positive, consistent with the cyclical pick-up in global economic growth, current growth in trade was slower than expected, largely due to on-shoring trends which have equalized the relationship between world trade and domestic production growth.\n\n\"Moreover, while the US and Europe gain economic momentum, China is entering a steeper downturn. These factors will likely keep future growth in air freight demand contained, but still stronger than performance in 2013.\"\n\nAt regional levels, it was a mixed bag: Middle Eastern, Latin American and European carriers reported the strongest gains, at 11.9 per cent, 6.1 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively in February.\n\nThe North American and African markets, however, shrank - North America by 0.3 per cent and Africa, by 5.2 per cent.\n\nWith African carriers, volatility in growth rates is common, although this has been compounded by weaker performances in key regional economies (such as South Africa) in recent months, said IATA.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The hunt turned up nothing on Tuesday.\n\nThe international effort, which involves 10 aircraft, naval ships and now a British nuclear submarine, has illustrated the need to forge regular cooperation before a disaster strikes, said a senior US defence official.\n\nThe meeting of defence ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), the first to be hosted on US soil, will include a discussion on how civilian and military officials can work together to tackle natural disasters.\n\nAs countries face the dramatic effects of climate change, \"this kind of cooperation is going to be increasingly important for us and it's going to require that we think differently about how we approach some of these problems\", the defence official said. \"The more we can work together in advance . . . the better.\"\n\nMr Hagel and the Asean ministers are due to pay a visit on Wednesday to the USS Anchorage, an amphibious ship with a helicopter flight deck that the Americans say can be highly effective in disaster relief operations. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Last month, it announced plans for an initial public offering that could raise up to US$177.9 million.\n\n\"Right from the start, we've built the company to support immediate and on-going expansion. As food delivery knows no borders, we want to scale globally as fast as we can,\" Ralf Wenzel, co-founder and global managing director of foodpanda, told The Business Times.\n\nThis is achievable, he said, as foodpanda has localised teams and entrepreneurs in all of its markets, as well as a central team in Berlin to ensure common standards and knowledge sharing.\n\nIn Singapore, where the national pastime is often said to be eating, foodpanda is not only relevant and convenient, it also wants to become the platform for Singaporeans to discover new restaurants and food trends they may otherwise not know about, he said.\n\nWhere all the action happens is a cosy co-working space in a shophouse along North Canal Road. About 15 employees and interns work alongside one another around tables, performing tasks from customer relationship management to marketing and finance. The startup also shares the shophouse space with fellow Rocket-backed venture EasyTaxi.\n\nSaid Chinmay Malaviya, managing director of foodpanda Singapore: \"This has allowed us to work closely, leverage resources and bounce ideas off employees from fellow ventures.\"\n\nBefore North Canal Road, foodpanda shared an office with Zalora, a fashion e-commerce venture backed by Rocket. Like Mr Malaviya, Mr Wenzel is a seasoned entrepreneur who first sold a self-developed software while studying at HTW Berlin - University of Applied Sciences.\n\nToday, Mr Wenzel manages a 700-person global team and spends most of his time travelling between foodpanda's 41 offices across Asia, Africa, Latin America, central and eastern Europe, and the Commonwealth of Independent States.\n\nIn the first two months of this year alone, foodpanda expanded into eight markets including Lebanon, Algeria and Serbia.\n\n\"We see our customers as priority, and foodpanda as a customer retention business. We will continue to provide the most convenient way of ordering food and the biggest choices of restaurants, as well as invest in our mobile app - now the new platform for ordering food as generations move from the desktop or even directly from offline to mobile only,\" said Mr Wenzel.\n\nTo-date, foodpanda's global mobile app has been downloaded by over three million users worldwide.\n\nIt has also bagged close to US$50 million in venture capital funding from various investors including Sweden's AB Kinnevik, Russia's Phenomen Ventures, and parent incubator Rocket.\n\nThe German incubator has, since 2007, backed and founded about 75 startups in more than 50 countries that now generate close to US$3 billion in annual revenue, said a New York Times report.\n\nIt has also stood by its business model, despite critics calling it \"a copycat\", \"a clone factory\" and its co-founders (German-born Oliver, Marc and Alexander Samwer) \"not true entrepreneurs\".\n\nAfter all, said Alexander Kudlich, managing director of Rocket Internet, it is only about operationally doing every little thing right and faster and better than the others.\n\nNotable Rocket-backed startups include Alando, a German-language eBay which was sold to the latter for US$43 million in 1999; and CityDeal, a deal-of-the-day website acquired by Groupon for US$126 million in 2010.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is a fair assumption since the intent of this section is clearly to allow managements the flexibility to raise money quickly to capitalise on promising business opportunities that might suddenly present themselves. This is also to avoid the time-consuming route of calling for a full-fledged rights issue since this requires shareholder approval at a general meeting.\n\nOf course, not all business ventures that appear attractive at the start actually turn out to be that way. But it would be reasonable to expect managements that have been given a general mandate by their shareholders to provide clear details of the use of funds when that mandate is actually employed - after all, if shareholders are going to have their holdings diluted, they should at least be told why.\n\nSo far, so good. But what if the general mandate is used to raise money for non-specific or, on the face of it, general, non-urgent uses?\n\nStated differently, if companies are unable to provide clear uses of funds, then shouldn't the Singapore Exchange (SGX) either a) require better disclosure, and/or b) be given discretionary powers to impose a moratorium on the sale of the instruments that are issued before approving the listing of those instruments?\n\nThese were issues raised a year ago in this column (\"SGX needs discretionary power for moratorium on placements\" - March 15, 2013) but so far, they have not been addressed by regulators. Since then, there have been dozens of placements that needed some form of regulatory intervention to protect shareholder interests, yet have been allowed to pass.\n\nConsider, for example, the case of Albedo Ltd, which is currently embroiled in a high profile deal with Malaysian firm Infinite Rewards involving the injection of major Johor land assets into Albedo.\n\nThe party who introduced Albedo to Infinite Rewards was Choo Yeow Ming, a former substantial shareholder of Albedo and currently executive chairman of funeral parlour operators Asia-Pacific Strategic Investments, which like Albedo is listed on Catalist.\n\nOn Dec 13 last year, Albedo proposed placing out 260 million non-listed, non-transferable warrants under its general mandate to Dr Choo and existing shareholder Terry Leong at 0.1 cent each, split into 90 million for Dr Choo and 170 million for Mr Leong.\n\nThe figure of 260 million was just about the maximum allowed since the company said the limit beyond which the general mandate could not be employed was 262.2 million. The exercise price of each warrant was set at 4.338 cents, a 10 per cent discount to Albedo's market price at the time.\n\nAlso in its Dec 13 announcement, Albedo said the net proceeds of $160,000 raised ($260,000 less $100,000 expenses) from the issue and the $11.3 million that it would receive if all the warrants were converted would be used for \"working capital which includes, inter alia, the repayment of trade payables and borrowings in the ordinary course of business\".\n\nBoth men were said to be subscribing to the placement for \"personal investment purposes\" and the company said its existing working capital was enough to meet present requirements.\n\nThe placement was concluded on Jan 24 this year, at which time it was announced that Mr Leong exercised 60 million of the 170 million warrants he was granted. At that time, Albedo's shares traded at about 6 cents and assuming the new shares were immediately sold, the profit from this portion is estimated to be just about $1 million.\n\nOn Feb 11 and Feb 28, Albedo announced that Dr Choo exercised 45 million warrants on each day. Assuming the resultant shares were also sold immediately, the profit is estimated to be about $1 million.\n\nEverything was done by the book, so there can be no complaints on this front. Moreover, Albedo has received cash totalling around $6.5 million from the two warrant holders, which would help boost its working capital and aid in its \"repayment of trade payables and borrowings in the ordinary course of business\".\n\nHowever, there is some room for justifiable shareholder unhappiness, not only because of dilution from the issue of millions of new shares but also because the Johor deal now hangs in the balance and the shares have crashed to around 2.8 cents.\n\nMoreover, since the placement appears to have been for non-urgent, non-specific business ventures, some might quite legitimately ask whether SGX should have either requested more details on the use of the money, or imposed some restrictions on the exercise of the warrants, or both.\n\nThe bigger issue raised by the Albedo example is that there is scope for SGX to play a greater gatekeeping role in terms of looking after shareholder interests when companies exercise their general mandates to raise money, a role that assumes greater importance when there is no specific or urgent need for the money.\n\nSince placees are usually described as being interested in investing in the issuing company, introducing a moratorium of, say, three to six months should not be too objectionable.

This followed a gain of five cents on Tuesday after OCBC unveiled the deal.\n\nMoody's Investors Service said yesterday that it had placed the long-term debt, deposit and standalone ratings of OCBC on review for downgrade.\n\nIn contrast, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services had earlier said it affirmed its \"AA-\" long-term and \"A-1+\" short-term issuer credit ratings for OCBC. The outlook on the long-term rating is stable, it said.\n\n\"We affirmed the rating because we believe OCBC's financial profile will remain unaffected despite the bank's proposed acquisition of Hong Kong-based Wing Hang Bank Ltd,\" said Standard & Poor's credit analyst Chris Lee.\n\nOCBC said buying Wing Hang would help it gain better access to China and funding the deal will involve both debt and equity.\n\nMoody's said the main reason for the review for downgrade is the execution risk associated with the financing of such a large acquisition.\n\nThe success of the new capital raising is important for OCBC if it is to maintain capitalisation on a par with similarly rated peers, it said.\n\nOn a pro-forma basis, OCBC's Tier 1 ratio would decrease to around 11 per cent from 14.5 per cent in December 2013, if it acquires 100 per cent of Wing Hang Bank without raising any equity.\n\nThe negative pressure on OCBC's Tier 1 ratio will come from the $2.8 billion goodwill related to the acquisition, because the offer price is equivalent to 1.77 times the December 2013 net book value of Wing Hang Bank.\n\nAnalysts were mainly neutral on the deal, noting the dilution to shareholders despite the fact that the price, at 1.77 times, was lower than expected.\n\nThey also cited Wing Hang's small exposure to China, its tiny trade finance business and that the bank is essentially a consumer bank in Hong Kong, where competition is fierce.\n\nCredit Suisse said OCBC might need a $2.5-3 billion rights issue.\n\nTo achieve minimum return on equity dilution and at the same time maintain a fully loaded T1 close to 10 per cent levels, OCBC needs to fund at least 40-50 per cent (roughly $2.5-3 billion) of the deal value by raising new equity, it said.\n\nSaid Phillip Capital: \"Cheaper than expected does not equate to a good deal; despite being in line with strategic rationale of expanding its Greater China business, the acquisition is likely to be a negative to near-term shareholder value.\"\n\nManagement expects the acquisition to be earnings-accretive by 2017.\n\nA Standard Chartered report asked how OCBC could enhance Wing Hang's franchise to justify the premium paid.\n\nIt said that although OCBC speaks about its aspirations for China, 77 per cent of Wing Hang's pre-tax profit is from Hong Kong. Some 52 per cent of 2013 Hong Kong pre-tax earnings came from the retail business, which is facing intense competition.\n\n\"Is a Hong Kong presence necessary for the RMB business? Will the upcoming free-trade zones in Shanghai and Guangzhou dilute the importance of Hong Kong?\" asked the report.\n\nMost positive was DBS Group Research, which said \"share price should remain neutral in the near term, pending funding plan disclosure; we believe this acquisition would be long-term positive for OCBC\".\n\nMaintain \"buy\"; target price $12.40, it said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Technology companies including Samsung Electronics Co and TPK Holding Co led gains in Seoul and Taipei. Property companies rallied in Hong Kong after the Shanghai Securities News said that some Chinese cities are discussing easing curbs on home purchases.\n\nUS manufacturing indexes and vehicle-sales figures on Tuesday signalled that growth may be speeding up in the largest economy, while weak Chinese factory gauges spurred speculation that Communist Party leaders will add stimulus. The most-active US exchange traded fund (ETF) investing in emerging markets has drawn about US$2 billion of inflows in the past five days as the MSCI gauge extended its advance to an almost four-month high.\n\n\"The US economy is continuing its strength and that'll boost growth in emerging nations through exports,\" said Wei Wei, an analyst at West China Securities Co in Shanghai. \"If China really relaxes restrictions on housing purchases, that'll be not only great news for the property market but the whole economy as well.\"\n\nThe MSCI Emerging Markets Index is valued at 10.2 times projected 12-month earnings, compared with 14.9 times for the MSCI World Index of developed countries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The developing-nations gauge is still down 5 per cent since the start of last year, versus a 26 per cent gain for the advanced-country shares.\n\nSamsung Electronics, the world's largest smartphone maker, climbed to its highest level this year, and TPK, the touch-screen maker that gets almost 70 per cent of its sales in North America, jumped 4.2 per cent. Poly Property Group Co and Greentown China Holdings Ltd rallied more than 7 per cent in Hong Kong, the most on MSCI's developing-nation gauge, while BBMG Corp, a Beijing-based cement producer, soared 5.6 per cent.\n\nInvestors withdrew a net US$42 million from ETFs focused on Chinese equities and bonds since the emerging-market index began rallying on March 20, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That's the only outflow from the ETFs for the so-called BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries or biggest developing markets as funds investing in Brazil, India and Russia attracted a combined US$422 million.\n\nChinese Premier Li Keqiang is under pressure to take steps to address weakening economic expansion amid deepening concern that the nation will miss its 7.5 per cent growth target this year, the weakest annual pace since 1990. The median estimate for first quarter expansion dropped to 7.4 per cent in March from 7.6 per cent in February, according to Bloomberg surveys of analysts. For the full year, the median forecast slid to 7.4 per cent.\n\nSinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Co lost 4.4 per cent after Chinese authorities signalled they may halt plans for a petrochemical plant following protests.\n\nIndia's rupee rose to an eight-month high.

Its net profit reached $3.5 billion excluding one-off items, up 4 per cent from the previous year.\n\nOCBC Bank has yet to publish its 2013 annual report.\n\nGiving an update on its regional strategy performance, UOB said that its regional franchise continued to deliver as regional markets' profit grew by 6.5 per cent in 2013, outpacing the returns in Singapore. Overseas profit contribution to the group rose to 39.1 per cent, up 6.3 percentage points from 32.8 per cent.\n\n\"While the two major trends of increasing intra-regional trade and rising consumer wealth are fuelling our current stage of growth, our solid results would not have been possible without the determination to execute well against our regional strategy,\" said Mr Wee Ee Cheong in his message to shareholders.\n\n\"In the process, we remain aware of, and are responsive to, the complexities of operating across different markets.\n\n\"In 2013, we strengthened our transaction banking, commodity financing and investment banking capabilities to serve our customers' growing and diverse business needs.\"\n\nUOB set up foreign direct investment advisory units in nine countries to offer businesses dedicated services to help them realise their regional ambitions across markets, he revealed.\n\nThe bank is also reaching out to the region's wealthy. \"We have harnessed our insight and experience to offer wealth management and other financial solutions appropriate for Asian consumers.\"\n\nIn 2013, UOB increased assets under management (AUM) from $66 billion to $75 billion, and is on track to achieve its AUM target of $100 billion by 2015.\n\nIt has extended an international property financing programme to help customers broaden their investment portfolio as they look beyond their home markets.\n\nUOB has established 48 dedicated wealth management centres across the region, 12 of them in Singapore. It has a new privilege banking centre in one of the most iconic buildings located on the Bund in Shanghai.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/china-ploughs-land-reform", "site_title": "China ploughs on with land reform", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nChina ploughs on with land reform\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Apr 2, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nLU Jiaqing, a sturdy farmer of 51, is all smiles when talking about how his life has changed since he was allowed to lease his land. He said: \"I now earn 10 times more than when I was looking after the land myself, and I have more free time.\"\n\nHis neighbours have likewise improved their livelihoods. When the law was changed 10 years ago to allow leasing, Mr Lu leased his plot to a neighbour. The frequent floods in his corner of Baiyi village in Anhui province in central China had damaged the land, and he could not afford to drain it, so he handed it over to someone who could. \"I was earning close to nothing. It made no sense to continue,\" he said.\n\nAnhui is where China has been trying agricultural reform. It was there in 2004 that farmers were allowed to transfer rights of their land use and also where the government first cancelled tax on agricultural production. It is in Anhui as well, that the government is seeking to push through its major land reform announced during the Communist Party plenum last November; this round of changes includes generalising land transfers and setting up a national cadastre, an official register of the quantity, value and ownership of real estate.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 published after the plenum, unveiling a major shift in policy for the government, said that farmers would be encouraged to transfer their plots of land. It added: \"The urban-rural dual structure is a major barrier preventing the integration of development.\"\n\nThis was a reference to farmers being traditionally tied to their land, which they cultivate, but do not own; neither is the land theirs to sell, exchange or build structures on.\n\nThe differences in earnings between people in the countryside and the new cities have forced millions of farmers to leave their village homes to seek their fortunes, leaving many rural villages populated by retired farmers looking after their grandchildren. Agriculture has remained traditional.\n\nThe rural-urban divide has opened the government's eyes to the need to improve the livelihoods of the rural population of 60 million, and to unleash its spending power. Beijing also wants to develop a new class of young, qualified farmers willing to remain at home and invest in their land, so the government is handing out subsidies to those who stay put instead of migrating to the cities.\n\nLu Tongfei, 26, is one of these new-generation farmers. He runs Pingfei, which rents most of the surrounding land in Baiyi from the other farmers and has put 266 ha under wheat and vegetables. \"As soon as the regulations changed, my father saw the opportunity,\" he said. His father's plot used to be only 50 ha.\n\nPingfei pays 860 yuan (S$174) a year for each mu of land on a five-year lease (one mu is 60 sq m). All the revenue earned is ploughed back into new technology or is used to upgrade facilities; Mr Lu said that the company is now building a state-of-the art R&D centre to develop its own grains.\n\nElsewhere in Anhui, similar innovations are taking root. Kingorigin is shaping up as an example of a modern agricultural enterprise. Supported by the local government, the company founded in 2011 is renting land from its surrounding villages. Within its premises, vegetables are cultivated without soil, biodegradable plastics are used and waste is retooled as fuel to generate energy. The vegetable crop is digitally monitored by cameras, and the company is undertaking R&D. There is a challenge: because Kingorigin does not own the land it operates on, it is difficult for it to get loans from banks.\n\nAnalysts say that the reforms announced last November point in the right direction, but many have remarked that only by opening the market completely will China make that move from traditional to modern agriculture, and be in the position to grant farmers the necessary rights.\n\nBut granting full ownership is not on the government's agenda - at least, not yet. On the ground, even the plan to draw up a national cadastre is proving difficult. In Anhui, implementation has been moving more slowly than expected; it seems unlikely a land transfer exchange centre will be set up before the end of next year, as previously planned.\n\nA report by the Ministry of Land and Resources published this year has already pointed the finger at some farmers who are riding on the push for change to lease their land for industrial use instead of agricultural use.\n\nThe biggest hurdle will be put up by the local governments, which stand to lose their main source of revenue. Already, the first major overhaul of land rights had to be abandoned 10 years ago because of local resistance to change.\n\nThough President Xi Jinping, in his tours abroad and across China, has been saying that reform, including agricultural reform, will see the day, vested interests will significantly delay any major change.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Just over 20 per cent of decided voters appear set to vote for a PDI-P candidate when they go to the polls on April 9; the Great Indonesia Movement Party (Gerindra) had the support of 16 per cent.\n\nThe PDI-P, which pledged last month to nominate Mr Widodo as its candidate for president, stands to boost its standing as it taps into his widespread popularity, say analysts.\n\nA presidential election is set for July 9.\n\nPoised to wrest back the reins of power for the first time in a decade, the PDI-P is expected to tackle the country's woeful infrastructure, unsteady foreign direct investment and endemic corruption. Construction companies, banking, property and retail sectors are poised to benefit.\n\nUnderpinning this outlook is Mr Widodo's track record in government dating back to 2005, when the former furniture salesman was elected mayor of Surakata, or Solo.\n\nMore lately, as the governor of Jakarta, the man widely known as Jokowi kick-started billions of dollars in public works, including rapid rail and flood management projects; populist measures such as free healthcare to some of Jakarta's poor and improvement of the city's slums have bolstered his can-do image.\n\nAgus Yanuar, president-director of Samuel Asset Management in Jakarta, said: \"The market sentiment is very positive on Jokowi. He has the credentials and a track record that people can see.\n\n\"He is a new breed of leaders that has raised hopes that he'll form a clean, fast, results-oriented government.\"\n\nThe PDI-P's pledge last month capped nearly a year of speculation that he would nudge aside party chief and former Indonesian president Megawati Sukarnoputri to become the party's nominee for president.\n\nThe rupiah has gained 2.5 per cent in the past month, extending its gains from the end of last year, when it lost more than a fifth of its value.\n\nThe Jakarta Composite Index has gained more than 6 per cent in the past month and is on track to reach 5,200, a level not seen for almost a year, recent research from Credit Suisse noted.\n\nMr Widodo, a fan of heavy metal music and from a modest background, has consistently outpaced his rivals in the race for support by a margin of two to one for the better part of a year. A poll among likely voters by Charta Politik in the first week of March pegged his support at 37 per cent; support for Subianto Prabowo, a former general and descendent of Javanese aristocracy, was at 15 per cent.\n\nSamuel Asset Management's Mr Yanuar said: \"Jokowi is a person the public sees as 'one of us'.\"\n\nHowever, Mr Widodo's admitted macroeconomic inexperience and his populist streak have troubled investors.\n\nShortly after taking over as governor in 2012, he opposed Indonesia's fuel price increase last June, and approved labour demands for a 44 per cent minimum wage hike, although he fended off demands for another large wage hike last year.\n\nThe PDI-P's manifesto published last month, while mostly rhetorical, underscored the party's protectionist bent; it vowed, for example, to limit foreign investment to protect the country from overseas meddling.\n\nRobert Prior-Wandesforde, the head of Southeast Asia Economics for Credit Suisse, commented in a report late last month: \"We believe it would be premature to assume that a Jokowi presidency will usher in a period of business-friendly structural reform.\"\n\nThe likely surge in investments and expectations of a clean, competent government is expected to buoy stocks and retail shares such as those for Electronic City and Matahari, as well as for top lenders such as Bank Central Asia and Bank Mandiri, Credit Suisse said.\n\nEven so, any honeymoon that a potential President Widodo might expect after the Oct 20 inauguration may be a short one: There are worries over his ability to fend off Ms Megawati's influence over naming people to Cabinet posts and enduring fiscal issues such as the current account deficit, which blew out to a record last year.\n\nCredit Suisse said: \"We expect the euphoria to continue for a few weeks, after which the market will focus on the real politik and the challenges any incumbent will face.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But the median price will rise, she projected. \"I expect it to be caught up 100 per cent by midyear\", and then slightly surpass the height of the market in 2008, she said.\n\nWhile new developments represented less than 20 per cent of marketwide closings, they drove some of the biggest price increases.\n\nThe average price of a condo jumped 35 per cent in the first quarter compared with the same period last year to set a record of US$2.368 million, skewed largely by the sale of two penthouses, according to reports by Halstead and Brown Harris Stevens. In January, a US$50.912 million penthouse closed at Walker Tower in the Chelsea section.\n\nAnd last month, media mogul Rupert Murdoch purchased a US$43.01 million triplex penthouse atop One Madison on the south-east side of Madison Square Park.\n\nThe mega-sales are expected to continue as contracts for apartments exceeding US$90 million apiece at premium developments such as 432 Park Ave and One57 turn into done deals.\n\nSuch headline-grabbing sales tend to have a covetous effect on sellers at all levels, brokers say. \"They see this and say my apartment is worth more,\" said Hall Willkie, president of Brown Harris Stevens.\n\nBut while a US$90 million condo sale may help boost overall confidence in the market, he said, it \"does not have a direct impact on a two-bedroom Park Avenue apartment or something on East 85th Street\".\n\nInventory was still a challenge, with the number of available apartments either flat or down by as much as 17 per cent in the first quarter compared with the same period last year, depending on the report.\n\nIt was the first quarter to show a decline in contracts signed after seven consecutive quarters of double-digit year-over-year gains, according to a report by the Corcoran Group. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

When she returned, the trolley and its contents were gone. The mail has not been recovered and no arrests have been made.\n\nIDA noted yesterday that SingPost, \"had not issued any lock or chain for trolleys used by its postmen\", then. Also, the nylon bags used to carry mail were \"only slightly water-resistant\".\n\nThe postwoman had not taken the trolley across the street with her because she did not want the letters to get wet as it was raining heavily. Since then, she has been counselled and sent for retraining, SingPost said.\n\nSince the mail theft, SingPost has introduced lockable water-resistant canvas bags and lock-and-chain sets for these trolleys. It is also designing a new customised mail trolley which will be introduced in the second half of this year.\n\nSingPost said yesterday that it \"takes its public service obligations seriously\", noting that it had previously committed to invest $100 million on improving service quality over the next few years.\n\nLast year, SingPost was fined $10,000 by IDA for falling short of the regulator's postal quality of service standards.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Units at MCL's earlier project in Jurong East, J Gateway, were sold at an average of $1,480 psf when they were launched last July, with most of the 738 units snapped up in one day.\n\nAnother point of reference is resale prices at Lakefront Residences near the Lakeside station, which achieved a median $1,121 psf over the past two years since it was launched by Keppel Land at an average price of $1,020 psf in 2010.\n\n\"The demand can support this (Lakeville) project but the loan limit under the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) will still be an issue,\" said OrangeTee research head Christine Li.\n\nIf the attractions slated for the Jurong Lakeside District under URA's 2008 masterplan really take off, that will be beneficial to the project, she added.\n\nPlans to remake Jurong Lake District into a commercial and lifestyle hub will be fully realised in 10 to 15 years. The transformation is starting to take shape with the recent opening of new retail malls and more homes being launched. A new Jurong General Hospital and a Genting hotel in Jurong will be ready in 2015.\n\nOng Kah Seng, director at R'ST Research, said he expected a good take-up for the project from owner-occupiers as Lakeside is \"increasingly shaped into an enchanting residential enclave\" with proximity to an MRT station.\n\n\"There is promising investment potential in Lakeside, a tested leasing demand area, although the increased supply will mean that rents have to be pegged attractively and investors need to have a realistic, long-term investment expectation,\" he said.\n\nAmong projects located near the Lakeside station, Caspian and Lakeholmz - projects developed by Frasers Centrepoint Homes - achieved median rents of $3.45 psf per month and $3.10 psf per month respectively in the fourth quarter, based on URA quarterly rental data.\n\nMCL recently won two adjacent executive condominium sites in Chua Chu Kang. It is slated to launch Palms@Six Avenue in May, which will have 32 semi-detached houses on a freehold site along Sixth Avenue.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It also has a fleet of 70 aircraft at the LCCT.\n\nMoreover, it reckoned that the two-month operational readiness & airport transfer (Orat) period prescribed by airport operator Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB) was \"unrealistic and overly optimistic\".\n\n\"Even the Orat for the transfer from KLIA main terminal to LCCT in 2006 took longer than two months when AirAsia's operations were significantly smaller,\" the airline said in a statement.\n\nAlthough the imbroglio has been going on for a while, the continuing impasse comes at a bad time given the intense global scrutiny on the country's aviation sector following the loss of the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 on March 8 and the ongoing search operations in the Indian Ocean.\n\nMoreover, as first-day hiccups at new airports are common, many wonder if it is wise to rush the process.\n\nThe airline's sizeable fleet gives it \"a bargaining chip here\", observed RHB Investment bank analyst Ahmad Magfur Usman, who sees \"risk of a delay in the opening of KLIA2\".\n\nAirAsia appears bent on pressing home its advantage as KLIA2's main customer.\n\nIn its statement, the carrier pointed to \"other key commercial, operational and contractual open items\" which are still being discussed with MAHB and which it said needed to be resolved prior to the transfer to KLIA2. These are said to include the passenger service charge and other airport fees.\n\nReady for KLIA2 are smaller budget carriers Cebu Pacific, Malindo Air, Tiger Airways and Mandala Airlines.\n\n\"AirAsia will be making an official announcement and inform all of its guests once we are ready to proceed with the move to KLIA2,\" said AirAsia Bhd chief executive Aireen Omar.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Thanks to moves like these, the number of weekly takeoffs and landings at Narita Airport has decreased by 63.\n\nFurthermore, while the number of annual takeoff and landing slots for international and domestic flights at Narita Airport stands at 270,000, only about 210,000 of the slots are used - about 180,000 for international flights and about 30,000 for domestic flights. This is because the airport is located far from central Tokyo, and because the facilities are unable to operate around the clock.\n\nNarita International Airport Corp, the company that manages the airport, has been trying to attract low-cost carriers (LCCs), and, to that end, plans to complete construction of a new terminal building exclusively for LCCs by the end of fiscal 2014.\n\nOverseas budget airlines including Jetstar Airways of Australia and Scoot of Singapore, as well as domestic LCCs will start routes from and to Narita.\n\nThe nation's two major carriers, ANA and Japan Airlines, will position Narita as a transit hub linking North America and Asia, while they intend to use Haneda as a hub for their international and domestic flights. However, the Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Ministry continues considering Narita the gateway to the Tokyo metropolitan area. The ministry plans to increase the number of takeoff and landing slots for international and domestic flights at the airport to 300,000 a year by the end of fiscal 2014, so it has been pushing forward with construction to extend a runway and to increase hangar space at the airport.\n\nThe government aims to boost the number of foreigners visiting Japan to 20 million a year, with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics in mind. Yet, Japan is unlikely to be able to meet demand from carriers hoping to start services to and from Japan with the current annual total of 390,000 slots when international flights to and from Narita and Haneda airports are combined.\n\nA transport ministry panel of experts has since November been examining a number of possibilities for boosting international flights to and from the Tokyo metropolitan area, such as opening a new flight route over central Tokyo and constructing new runways at Haneda and Narita. If the new route is approved, Haneda will be able to increase takeoff and landing slots using only the four existing runways. Because newer plane models have quieter engines, some experts believe they could resolve the problem of noise. The panel is expected to compile a report in April. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Ms Ng was formerly a Blumont director while Mr Chen is LionGold's business and corporate development director.\n\nInterestingly, both names also appear in construction firm Swee Hong's list of top 20 largest shareholders.\n\nLionGold said that the board was \"not aware if any offence has been committed\" and has not heard from the two individuals in respect of the investigations.\n\nBased on data from Handshakes, a firm which analyses networks in the capital markets, Blumont's G1 also owns interests in LionGold, Asiasons, Innopac Holdings, China Fibretech and Catalist-listed ITE Electric Company and Chaswood Resources.\n\nThe web of connections in the penny stock realm doesn't end there. Asiasons owns 64 per cent of Chaswood and 8 per cent of LionGold and also has interests in ISR Capital. On the other hand, Innopac Holdings is 7.2 per cent owned by Ipco International.\n\nMagnus' largest shareholder is Wira Dani Abdul Daim who also owns 15 per cent in ISR Capital. Asiasons is ISR's largest shareholders.\n\nSources say several individuals were called up for questioning yesterday by the CAD and that more announcements involving them and companies they are linked to could ensue in the following days.\n\nA legal expert said given the events that have taken place involving the shares of these firms, trading irregularities could mean a lot of things.\n\n\"A chunk of the SFA covers trading-related offences such as insider dealing, manipulation of share prices, false trading, wash sales, among others,\" said the legal expert. \"Some times, one particular action can also cover a few offences,\" he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We can develop new facilities . . . such as those that focus specifically on clusters, those that require common and shared facilities that will give a competitive advantages to companies,\" said Mr Png.\n\n\"Private developers are probably not willing to do this because of the upfront capital investment that is needed. So the divestment, on one hand, affects tenants in (previously JTC- owned) facilities but, on the other hand, allows us to focus on other aspects where we can add more value to industries,\" he said.\n\nYesterday, JTC unveiled a host of ideas stemming from its four key strategies. These ideas include the development of more innovative spaces and decking over major roads and highways.\n\nFor the former, innovative spaces for other key clusters identified include a poultry processing hub, a furniture/timber hub and a chemicals hub.\n\nJTC is also looking at integrated multi-user factories for the oil and gas sector which could feature flatted factories for heavier manufacturing, warehousing space, offices and even dormitories for foreign workers.\n\n\"By co-locating (smaller players) into a single location, it fosters greater collaboration, reduces a lot of inefficiency and hopefully raises the productivity of the industry. For us, it helps optimise land use as well,\" said Mr Png.\n\nA total of 16 Innovative Space projects are in the works - seven under development and nine on the drawing board. They are expected to add 800,000 sq m of multi-user space by 2017, said JTC.\n\nSeparately, JTC is looking at ways to deck over highways and major roads in its quest to create new land and space. This is in addition to other means such as land reclamation and the creation of underground spaces like the Jurong Rock Caverns.\n\n\"If you take the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE), NUS Science Park is physically separated from One North by the AYE. We want to build an integrated, connected community where the academia work closely with the industries . . . this physical separation prevents it from happening,\" said Mr Png.\n\nIf, however, there is a way to deck over the AYE, it would create a contiguous space for people to interact. While JTC is still studying the feasibility of such a deck, Mr Png said that it hopes to introduce offices or al fresco dining on the deck rather than an overhead bridge.\n\nMr Png also said that he expects industrial property prices to moderate further in light of the cooling measures and increased supply of multi-user space coming into the market.\n\nBased on the average of 28 hectares of space released per year from 2010 to 2013, JTC estimates that from 2014 to 2016, two million sq m of space, including 500,000 sq m of multi- user industrial space, will be added annually.\n\nThis compares with an average annual demand of one million sq m of space.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

From a topline perspective, Indonesia is the biggest contributor,\" Abdul Farid Alias, group president and CEO of Maybank, told The Business Times yesterday at a press briefing.\n\n\"The net interest margin is bigger, but the cost is higher. So we need to manage the costs better,\" he added, referring to Indonesia.\n\nSingapore's pre-tax profit contribution stands at 14 per cent of total earnings for Maybank, which acquired Singapore brokerage Kim Eng Holdings in 2011. As a comparison, Indonesia's pre-tax profit contribution stands at 7 per cent.\n\n\"We hope Singapore to grow much bigger (but) I don't have a target,\" said Mr Farid. He said the same of Indonesia.\n\nAsked if Maybank would have its consumer banking operations incorporated in Singapore, as did Standard Chartered Bank in 2012, Mr Farid said that it would depend on how regulations evolve. \"Tell me how the regulations are going to look like, then I can tell you whether we're going to do it,\" he said.\n\nBroadly, Maybank plans to ramp up its corporate banking. Maybank also remains upbeat on growth from Asean, as intra-Asean trade expands further, he added.\n\nMaybank's business is split evenly between consumer and corporate banking segments. In time, the bank expects to move towards having two-thirds of its business coming from corporate banking, and a third from consumer banking.\n\nThis \"deliberate\" move is already in place, with the bank getting more active in loan syndication and bond issues, he said.\n\nThe bank, he said, would not be interested in acquiring Asian assets with no consumer focus from global banks, which are shedding businesses to meet tougher regulatory standards imposed in the wake of the financial crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, Maybank has not approached \"any party\" on plans to acquire a commercial banking licence in Thailand yet, though the market remains a long-term play for the Malaysian bank.\n\n\"We're not talking to any party at the moment,\" said Mr Farid.\n\nThailand remains a \"long-term\" market for Maybank, said John Chong, CEO of Maybank-Kim Eng Group, and Maybank Investment Bank Berhad.\n\nBut given the political tensions in Thailand, Mr Farid said that the bank would watch the political situation, and \"make a call when the right time comes\". \"We will keep these options close to our hearts,\" he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The most deadly in our part of the world was Typhoon Haiyan, which devastated parts of the Philippines last year. In 2012, there was \"Superstorm Sandy\", a destructive hurricane that hit the North-eastern United States. This year, the UK suffered its worst floods since 1776. There have also been severe cyclones in India and Myanmar, floods in Thailand and Pakistan, bush-fires in Australia, the list goes on. Even Singapore has not been immune. We have just endured the driest February since 1869.\n\nMuch scientific opinion is of the view that these events might have something in common: climate change. And so it was, that at a press conference on the latest report of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released on March 31, one of its authors, Christopher Fields, pointed out: \"There's no question that we live in a world that's already altered by climate change.\"\n\nThe report makes sobering, if not alarming, reading. The impact of climate change could be potentially \"severe, pervasive and irreversible\", it says. Drawing on updated scientific evidence, the report's authors point out that the effects have, if anything, turned out worse than predicted in 2007, when the last major IPCC report was issued. Looking ahead, the scientists see climate change negatively affecting crop yields; episodes of extreme precipitation and flooding in some areas and more droughts and a depletion of groundwater in others; cases of extinction of marine life; higher heat-related deaths and general increases in ill-health, more hotspots of hunger; and risks of violent conflict sparked by one or more of the above. And that is only a partial list.\n\nBut the report is not all doom and gloom; it also sets out mechanisms to adapt to, and mitigate, some of the negative impact - ranging from better disaster risk management, including early warning systems, improved public health measures, reforestation, more efficient water resource management, economic diversification and the adoption of greener technologies.\n\nHowever, adaptation will be an expensive exercise, with the bill running into the hundreds of billions of dollars in aggregate. Who will pay? Much of the developing world, where a lot of the adaptation will need to take place, does not have the resources. Some form of transfers, whether through multilateral institutions or bilateral assistance programmes, will be needed. So too public education on a massive scale.\n\nSingapore has, to its credit, created institutions to deal with climate change issues - both through local initiatives and mechanisms to collaborate globally. There is also a rising awareness and understanding of environmental issues here - as reflected for example in the annual participation in Earth Hour. The latest findings on climate change are a reminder that such issues must remain high on any national agenda.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

MOL's new spending on LNG tankers accounts for about half of its total capital expenditure plan, worth one trillion yen, for the next six years.\n\nThe company also plans to invest 180 billion yen in offshore business as another area to propel its group net profit to 110 billion yen in the 2019 business year, which runs until March 2020, a near doubling of the 57 billion expected for the 2013 business year, which ends on March 31.\n\nAs a result of the spending MOL expects LNG tanker and offshore assets to make up about 26 per cent of its portfolio in 2020, up from 9 per cent now, it said.\n\nIts current fleet mainstay of dry bulkers and container ships will be slimmed to 49 per cent from 60 per cent.\n\n\"Considering ongoing shipyard overcapacity, we need to realise that a structural upturn in the market environment is years away,\" Mr Muto added.\n\n\"We want to lower our business exposure to market volatility.

Private-sector economists polled by Bloomberg had earlier forecast a reading of 51.1.\n\nA reading above 50 denotes growth, while one under 50 points to a contraction in the manufacturing sector.\n\nGiving his take on the March figure, CIMB economist Song Seng Wun said: \"Overall PMI may have dipped but it's still above 50 and showing modest expansion. But I'm paying a bit more attention to the (electronics PMI), and keeping my fingers crossed - tech factories should start to be busier against the backdrop of improving global demand, especially coming from developed economies like the US.\"\n\nSub-indices for the electronics sector index seem to bear this out - growth was registered in new orders from domestic and overseas markets, and electronics production output and imports continued to expand.\n\nBarclays economist Leong Wai Ho saw the pick-up in electronics PMI as a \"particularly healthy development\".\n\n\"It shows that electronics production is tied to the recovery in the global electronics cycle - as we approach the summer launch season for consumer electronics in Asia and also the greater willingness of US Fortune 500 companies to invest in IT this year,\" he said.\n\nStill, Mizuho economist Vishnu Varathan noted that \"the 14th successive expansion and decent gains in March do not override the fact that the (electronics) sector is starting from a very low base - a point that is glaringly evident in the industrial production numbers as well\".\n\nDBS economist Irvin Seah also wondered whether March's momentum can be sustained: \"The key surprise this time around is that we've seen an uptick in electronics PMI, despite the fact that we've seen an easing off in the semi book-to-bill ratio, (and a) flattening out in global semiconductor sales growth. This has been a pleasant surprise, but I'm not sure how sustainable it is.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the dip in overall PMI was attributed to lower new orders as well as lower levels of production output and inventory, said the Singapore Institute of Purchasing & Materials Management (SIPMM), which compiles the monthly index.\n\nEconomists such as Mr Leong were not too fazed by the slight retreat in overall PMI: \"I am less concerned about the marginally lower overall PMI reading, given that the drop in purchasing activity was due to producers trying to run down inventories of finished goods. Generally, this means that production will start to pick up if the external recovery continues.\"\n\nStill, Mr Varathan said: \"The overall index treading water is perhaps encouraging, but is far from exhilarating . . . The upshot is that there is not much in the PMI report that we do not already know. That is, admittedly, Singapore's manufacturing is staging a gradual and for now shallow rebound, but that is a long way off a spectacular come-back story unfolding in the near-term.\"\n\nOCBC economist Selena Ling noted that \"the manufacturing PMI retracement is largely in step with the other Asian manufacturing cues seen yesterday, where a similar picture of slippage was seen for Taiwan (52.7 versus 54.7), Indonesia (50.1 versus 50.5), India (51.3 versus 52.5) and China (48.0 versus 48.1), with the exception of Vietnam (51.3 versus 51.0)\".\n\nAdded HSBC's Frederic Neumann and Dinkar Pawan in a report titled What the latest PMIs mean for Asia: \"With a few exceptions, PMIs in East and West, while still above the waterline, have eased back further. Surprisingly, in Asia, new export orders picked up. But that may prove temporary. We're heading into the second quarter with little wind in our sails.\"\n\nWith advance GDP estimates for the first quarter due for release early this month, economists from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, OCBC and DBS are forecasting year-on-year Q1 GDP growth of 5.1, 5.6, and 5.8 per cent respectively.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Even before Russian President Vladimir Putin moved to annexe Crimea, challenging the status quo of global power in the process,the US pivot was looking shaky as growing tensions among Japan, China and South Korea threatened to drag Washington into unwelcome potential conflicts. A perceived need to reinforce Nato in Europe as post Cold-War detente gives way to new animosities and potential conflicts with Russia, plus ongoing problems in the Middle East, will inevitably pose global challenges to the international role and reach of US forces.\n\nAll this comes at a time when Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's assertive stance vis a vis China and South Korea has brought Tokyo's relations with both Beijing and Seoul to a low ebb, implying that demands on an already stretched US to act as global policeman will increase. China can hardly have failed to see the implications of the situation and recent events imply that Beijing's relations with another master of the geopolitical chess game, Moscow, are growing closer. This could have profound implications for the regional balance of power in Asia.\n\nMeanwhile, North Korea continues to test the resolve of the US to underpin the Japan-US alliance,a pact which Mr Abe has strained with his plan to revise Japan's constitution and other acts that Washington sees as provocative. Witness North Korea's firing of missiles into the Japan Sea. Mr Abe dared not challenge this latest North Korean provocation while he remains eager to bag a political and diplomatic triumph by securing a breakthrough on the issue of Japanese abductees to North Korea. Meanwhile, a kind of uneasy diplomatic stalemate prevails.\n\nPerhaps the only good that could come out of these shifts would be if they force Japan to confront the reality that the US-Japan alliance is no longer the \"most important bilateral relationship in the world\" and that Tokyo must aim for more stable relations with its immediate neighbours. Things will not revert to the status quo ante when Japan regarded itself as \"in but not of\" Asia - an \"unsinkable aircraft carrier\" as former prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone termed it, from which the US could police the Pacific. A Sino-Russia \"carrier\" too is now sailing in those waters. The status quo ante was, in any case, a sterile period for North-east Asia, when political animosities among countries of the region served to bolster Washington's \"policeman\" role in keeping the peace but also one when the vast economic potential of the region has been largely wasted.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Minutes later, its communications were cut off and it turned back across Malaysia and headed towards the Indian Ocean.\n\nMalaysia says the plane was likely diverted deliberately, probably by a skilled aviator, leading to speculation of involvement by one or more of the pilots. Investigators, however, have determined no apparent motive or other red flags among the 227 passengers and 12 crew members.\n\nThe Department of Civil Aviation said late on Monday: \"We would like to confirm that the last conversation in the transcript between the air traffic controller and the cockpit is at 0119 (Malaysian Time) and is \"good night Malaysian three seven zero\".\n\nMalaysia's ambassador to China told Chinese families in Beijing as early as March 12 that the last words had been \"all right, good night\". About two-thirds of the passengers on board were Chinese.\n\nThe DCA said that the authorities were still conducting \"forensic investigation\" to determine whether the last words from the cockpit were by the pilot or the co-pilot. Malaysia Airlines had previously said that the words were believed to have come from the co-pilot.\n\nNine ships and 10 aircraft resumed the hunt for wreckage from MH370 yesterday, hoping to recover more than fishing gear and other flotsam found since Australian authorities moved the search 1,100 km north after new analysis of radar and satellite data.\n\nACM Houston said that the challenging search, in an area the size of Ireland, would continue based on the imperfect information with which they had to work. \"But, inevitably, if we don't find any wreckage on the surface, we are eventually going to have to, probably in consultation with everybody who has a stake in this, review what to do next.\"\n\nUsing faint, hourly satellite signals gathered by British firm Inmarsat plc and radar data from early in its flight, investigators have only estimates of the speed the aircraft was travelling and no certainty of its altitude, ACM Houston said.\n\nSatellite imagery of the new search area had not given \"anything better than low confidence of finding anything\", said Mick Kinley, another search official in Perth.\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak will go to Perth today to see the operations first hand.\n\nAmong the vessels due to join the search in the coming days is an Australian defence force ship, the Ocean Shield, that has been fitted with a sophisticated US black box locator and an underwater drone.\n\nTime is running out because the signal transmitted by the missing aircraft's black box will die about 30 days after a crash due to limited battery life, leaving investigators with a vastly more difficult task. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

These include holding the annual general meeting and the timely filing of annual returns.\n\nThe training is offered in place of prosecution, Mr Tharman added.\n\nAcra said it issues about 10,000 letters for filing offences every year to both first-time errant directors and repeat offenders.\n\nThis compliance programme, to begin in June, comes as an internal study by Acra showed that many first-time errant directors are ignorant of statutory requirements and are not aware of their duties and responsibilities. Directors who participate will attend a half-day session on topics such as basic accounting and principles of good corporate governance.\n\nAcra will also partner the Singapore Institute of Directors to provide training in financial reporting to directors aimed at helping them fulfil their duty of ensuring the accuracy of financial statements, said Mr Tharman. The training will apply to directors of both listed companies and large non-listed firms, he added.\n\nOther initiatives are in the pipeline, or should be coming to fruition soon.\n\nFollowing an agreement announced in January between Acra and the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants, Acra will widen the scope of its financial reporting surveillance, by reviewing a sample of financial statements from listed companies as well as non- listed firms that report a large turnover and market capitalisation. Acra said in January that the exercise, which is to cover financial statements that have been given a clean bill of health by auditors, is being carried out with a view to taking regulatory action against errant directors.\n\nMr Tharman also noted that several small companies will soon be exempted from statutory audit, once upcoming Companies Act amendments are put in place. One of the changes, proposed in 2012, is to have the threshold for statutory audit raised from $5 million to $10 million in annual revenue. The move, aimed at reducing the regulatory burden on small businesses, will reduce compliance costs for a further 10 per cent of companies, or about 25,000 small firms, said Mr Tharman.\n\nOn the digital front, Acra will be launching a virtual institute of corporate law. Among other things, the institute will work with Acra legal officers on law reforms, said Mr Tharman.\n\nAnd by the year's end, Acra will have launched its new filing and information retrieval system for businesses and the public known as Next Generation Bizfile, said Mr Tharman. \"In an era of Big Data, companies want to be able to effectively mine data.\"\n\nMr Tharman highlighted that regulators have to maintain balance when looking at the three pillars of government regulation, market-based disclosure and discipline, as well as responsibility of the investor.\n\n\"Relying primarily on government regulation tends to introduce moral hazard, and weakens the incentive for investors to . . . do their due diligence,\" he said. \"But neither can we rely exclusively on market discipline or leave investors to figure out what is real or false.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was in tandem with the decline in sales transactions, with just 1,676 caveats lodged in the first quarter, down from 4,260 a quarter earlier.\n\n\"The subdued market in the first three months of 2014 appears to have set the tone for the rest of the year,\" said Chia Siew Chuin, director of research and advisory at Colliers International. \"Overall, private home prices are expected to continue to soften, with the full-year decline possibly in the region of 5-8 per cent.\"\n\nAlice Tan, head of consultancy and research at Knight Frank, noted that the private homes market is now at an inflexion point in terms of prices.\n\n\"The downward fall could persist towards the second half of this year as the property cooling measures and TDSR (total debt servicing ratio) ruling continue to bite market sentiment,\" she said, pegging an average of 3-4 per cent decline in private home prices for the full year.\n\nPrices of non-landed homes declined across all regions, with those in the core central region (CCR) sliding further for the fourth consecutive quarter - 1.3 per cent, after the 2.1 per cent decline in Q4. In the outside central region (OCR), prices dipped 0.3 per cent, after a one per cent decline in Q4.\n\nPrivate home prices in the rest of central region (RCR) fell the most in Q1, 2.8 per cent, against a 0.4 per cent rise in the previous quarter, as fewer transactions were made.\n\nPrices of landed homes slipped 0.6 per cent in Q1, after a one per cent decline in Q4.\n\nLoan curbs, including the TDSR, additional buyers' stamp duty and sellers' stamp duty, have hit private home buyers, particularly those who are already highly leveraged or own one or more properties, said ERA Realty key executive officer Eugene Lim.\n\n\"Moderating prices in the HDB resale market also diverted buyers' attention away from the private market. Upgraders are unable to sell their HDB flats at a high price and buy a private property.\"\n\nDemand for HDB resale flats has been dampened by the huge supply of new build-to-order (BTO) flats. HDB said yesterday that it would roll out 3,060 more BTO flats in May in Bukit Batok and Woodlands. And 3,000 more flats will be offered in a concurrent Sale of Balance Flats exercise.\n\nThe HDB resale market has also been daunted by the loan cap and the recent overhaul of the resale process, property consultants say.\n\nSince August last year, the loan limit under the mortgage servicing ratio for HDB resale flats has been lowered from 35 per cent to 30 per cent. New permanent residents are also made to wait for three years before buying a resale flat.\n\nWhile the median cash-over-valuation for resale flats has touched down to zero of late, HDB overhauled its resale process in March, requiring buyers to sign the option to purchase before getting a valuation.\n\nOng Kah Seng, director at R'ST Research, said: \"Owners who really have to sell their flat are generally keen to sell it at valuation price or even below valuation price since there would be negligible contribution to their personal liquidity with such low COV prevailing in the market.\"\n\n\"There is a potential for prices to continually fall after Q1 2014 because prices are still at near record-high levels and have yet to significantly contribute to improved buyers' affordability even though COV is probably negligible going forward.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Effective rents, or what tenants paid after any landlord breaks such as a free month, averaged US$1,089 a month, up from US$1,055 a year earlier, Reis Inc said in a report. The vacancy rate fell to 4 per cent, down from 4.4 per cent and the lowest since the third quarter of 2001, when it was 3.9 per cent.\n\nRentals remain popular four years into a US apartment recovery fuelled by the foreclosure crisis, tighter mortgage standards and many people's preference for leasing. A wave of new construction in response to the demand sparked concern among landlords that rent gains would slow. Builders completed 131,450 new units in 2013, up 66 per cent from the previous year and more than triple the 42,491 apartments added in 2011, Reis said.\n\n\"Demand for apartments is seemingly insatiable,\" Ryan Severino, senior economist at the New York-based research firm, said. \"Still-low vacancy, an improving economy and labour market, and lots of newly completed Class A properties coming online with rents higher than the market average will all conspire to push asking and effective rents up by roughly 3.3 per cent this year.\"\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Property\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

Hard on the heels of last month's very successful Asia Pacific Maritime (APM) event comes the 9th Singapore Maritime Week (SMW), starting on April 6.\n\nAPM was very much by the industry, for the industry. It was one of the most impressive trade shows I have seen. Think of just about anything to do with the technical side of shipping and it was there. The associated conferences covered a wide range of topics with many also focusing on the technical side of operations.\n\nSMW is rather different. The emphasis is on activities for everyone, from the industry players to the general public. As has been the case since the first SMW in 2006, it is essentially the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore's (MPA) baby, though there are plenty of godparents, notably the Association of Singapore Marine Industries, the Singapore Maritime Foundation and the Singapore Shipping Association. This year's SMW comprises 29 events, making it the biggest show so far.\n\nSo what is it all about? According to MPA chief executive Andrew Tan, SMW is aimed at reaching out to the public, especially the young, through fun and exciting outreach activities.\n\nBut it is also for those already in the industry. Mr Tan says: \"We hope to put Singapore on the thought leadership map, by bringing the best experts and practitioners to share their expertise and insights, and promoting the exchange of best practices in the industry. With Singapore's strategic location, SMW also provides a one of its kind business platform for companies to access new market in the region and beyond.\"\n\nKey sector\n\nNobody in Singapore ought to be unaware of just how important shipping is to the country's economy. It accounts for 7 per cent of gross domestic product and provides work to about 170,000 people. In total, the maritime sector comprises about 5,000 companies active in everything from bunkering to ship chandlery, from vessel operating to ship repair. But anybody who visits the SMW exhibition at VivoCity, Jurong Point and Parkway Parade will come away much better informed.\n\nAs part of the various projects to raise awareness about career opportunities in the shipping sector, more than 400 students, maritime employees and members of the public will go\n\non Maritime Learning Journeys that include a port and sea tour to the Raffles Lighthouse. In addition, students and young people will be involved in SMW by co-organising career talks and as guides for selected public outreach activities.\n\nAs well as what could broadly be termed \"outreach\", there are a good number of events intended to showcase Singapore's thought leadership on maritime issues. The Moore Stephens Shipping Forum will discuss the economic trends that affect shipping. SMW will also include Singapore Bunkering Symposium, Dry Cargo Chartering Seminar, Asian Maritime Law Conference, Automation and Autonomy Seminar, Sustainable Marine Transportation Conference and the ReCAAP ISC Piracy and Sea Robbery Conference. And that is not by any means a complete list of SMW's high-level opportunities for updating and sharing knowledge for maritime professionals.\n\nBasic objectives\n\nThere is no reason to doubt that SMW 2014 will be another resounding success. The question will then be how to build on that in the future. One way might be to look at the timing of events. Come 2016, would it be an idea for SMW and APM to coincide?\n\nAnd then it might be worth looking at the basic objectives of SMW. Generally speaking, it has two different types of events. The first is aimed at the general public and the second at existing practitioners and companies within the industry. Will there be a point when, to continue to increase the effectiveness of SMW, it would be worth considering splitting it into two?\n\nWould SMW be stronger as a means of outreach to youth and the general public if, instead of getting involved in events aimed at those already in the industry, all companies and organisations involved in shipping concentrated on showing Singapore what they are doing and why it matters?\n\nI thought I would throw those ideas in the pot but there could well be good reasons to stick with the current format.

Swissco's acquisition of a fast- growing international rig owner will help diversify its earnings base and provide us with a stable, recurring income.\"\n\nUOB-Kay Hian has been appointed the sole financial adviser, and Provenance Capital has been appointed the independent financial adviser to advise on the transaction.\n\nBased on a Feb 27 Jones Lang LaSalle valuation report commissioned by Swissco, Scott and English, together with its jointly controlled entities, was valued at approximately $289 million.\n\nOn Wednesday, Scott and English clarified that the proposed acquisition is classified as a Very Substantial Acquisition instead of a Reverse Takeover, as it will not result in a change in control of the company.\n\nKim Seng Holdings, the holding company of Double Dragon Energy, is an existing controlling shareholder of Swissco, according to the announcement dated Feb 28.\n\nSwissco shares rose 1.5 cents, or 4.4 per cent, to close at 35.5 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That's unusual for a private jet - especially when the asking price tops the US$64.5 million on the sticker.\n\n\"We believe this plane's going to bring north of US$75 million,\" said Mr Dahlberg, president of Manassas, Virginia-based Emerald Aviation Inc and part-owner of the G650.\n\nBarely 15 months after its debut, the world's biggest and fastest business jet is a corporate status symbol, with owners as high profile as Exxon Mobil Corp, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Qualcomm Inc. The waiting list is almost four years long for a factory-fresh model, whetting appetites among tycoons and chief executive officers when a used G650 hits the market. \"It's the must-have airplane if you're in the top end of the spectrum,\" said Steve Varsano, founder of London-based Jet Business, who's sold two pre-owned G650s since November for more than US$70 million each to buyers he wouldn't identify.\n\nG650s are also must-have for Gulfstream parent General Dynamics Corp, the tank and submarine maker squeezed by shrinking US defence budgets. The jets helped boost 2013 aerospace revenue 17 per cent to US$8.12 billion, while combat systems unit revenue fell 23 per cent to US$6.12 billion.\n\n\"The G650 is doing exceptionally well,\" said Peter Arment, a Sterne, Agee & Leach Inc analyst who has a \"buy\" rating on Falls Church, Virginia-based General Dynamics. \"The demand for this plane is going to remain very strong.\"\n\nLarge, luxury aircraft are the bright spot in a US$21 billion private-jet market recovering unevenly from the 2008-09 financial crisis. While orders remain weak for small, personal models like the Mustang from Textron Inc's Cessna, corporate fleet managers and billionaires are shopping again for big planes able to make transoceanic routes.\n\nQualcomm's G650 flew the round trip between California and Barcelona before February's Mobile World Congress in the Spanish city, where then-CEO Paul Jacobs collected an industry award. That jaunt, as chronicled by airline-data tracker FlightAware, was well within the jet's advertised range of 7,000 nautical miles, enough to reach Beijing from New York without refuelling.\n\nPropelled by Rolls-Royce engines tucked on either side of the rear of the fuselage, the G650 can reach 627 miles an hour at 30,000 feet, about 93 per cent of the speed of sound. It seats as many as 18 people. To ease jet lag, the cabin air pressure is kept higher than on typical airplanes.\n\nOn a recent flight from Phoenix on a G650 owned by Honeywell International Inc, takeoff thrust pressed passengers into soft leather seats as the engines whispered.\n\nWood-veneer tables popped out at the touch of a button. Entertainment options included watching satellite television from a seat-belted sofa or gazing out the windows - billed as the largest on a business jet and fitted with powered shades - at the red sandstone cliffs of Sedona, Arizona.\n\n\"It's just unbelievably capable and unbelievably reliable,\" Honeywell pilot Andy Eldringhoff said as he guided the plane above the Arizona desert at 16,500 feet. CEO Dave Cote is among the users of the jet, which has Honeywell avionics in the cockpit.\n\nWith more than 50 delivered so far, the G650 has reset the market for business aircraft designed for maximum speed, comfort and distance. There won't be a competitor in the G650's class until 2016, when Bombardier Inc's Global 7000 is due for its initial handover.\n\nGulfstream enhances the aura of exclusivity by refusing to let buyers leapfrog by swapping or buying delivery slots, as occurs with commercial jets. The Savannah, Georgia-based company wrote a clause that strictly prohibits contract holders from selling their spots, said Steve Cass, a spokesman. \"There is no cutting in line,\" Mr Cass said. \"Everyone that we deal with is pretty important folks. Once you go down that, it's a pretty slippery slope. You just don't want to go there.\"\n\nGulfstream started taking G650 orders in March 2008 - six months before the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc bankruptcy triggered a global credit freeze - and customers stampeded to put down about US$3 million and sign purchase contracts, said Jet Business's Mr Varsano.\n\nWhile Mr Cass said the G650 order book held up during the economic crisis, flight trials were marred by a 2011 crash in New Mexico that killed four Gulfstream employees.\n\nUS safety officials concluded in 2012 that company pressure to speed up testing caused the accident. Gulfstream president Larry Flynn responded that any failings by the planemaker were inadvertent.\n\nThe G650 may become Gulfstream's most profitable aircraft ever, General Dynamics CEO Phebe Novakovic told investors on Feb 20 at a Barclays plc conference. The jet uses 50 per cent fewer parts than the smaller G550 and G450 and is assembled at a plant designed for the G650, according to Gulfstream.- Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Neither do they hold a majority of the prime malls, so the idea that their ownership of the highest-demand locations gives them pricing power doesn't quite hold.\n\nProperty consultants say the likely explanation then is simply that other landlords are benchmarking their rates to Reits, given the market transparency that the listed Reits practise - an effect they called \"herding\".\n\n\"After all, substantial information is made available publicly in quarterly reporting to shareholders, and any commercial or industrial property landlord would be savvy and numerical enough to make back-calculations to gauge possible rentals,\" said R'ST Research director Ong Kah Seng. Reits sometimes also publish rental figures in their annual reports.\n\nDuring the recent Budget debate, Minister of State for Trade and Industry Teo Ser Luck had pointed out that Reits hold a mere 13 per cent of retail spaces here.\n\nData gathered by property consultants put the percentage of retail assets in Reits' hands slightly higher - in the range of 20 to 22 per cent - but still a minority share.\n\nThis is equivalent to 7.5 million to 8.2 million square feet of net lettable retail space out of the total of 37.5 million sq ft of islandwide stock.\n\nThe percentage was calculated using publicly available Reits' stock information and data from the Time Series Database of the Urban Redevelopment Authority's Real Estate Information System.\n\nSLP International research head Nicholas Mak, who initially believed that Reits-owned malls would make up the majority along Singapore's prime shopping belt, did a count and found instead that of the 36 malls from Tanglin Mall to Plaza Singapura, only 5.3 malls (or 14.7 per cent) are owned by Reits.\n\nThe fractional ownership is due to the fact that some Reits own only part of a mall, for instance, Starhill Global Reit, which owns 74.23 per cent of Wisma Atria.\n\nAnother 15 malls are owned by property companies or developers (41.7 per cent), seven malls are strata-titled (19.4 per cent), six malls are owned by other private companies (16.7 per cent) and 2.7 malls by non-profit organisations (7.5 per cent).\n\nWith no majority holding in the malls, prime or otherwise, analysts are led to suppose then that other landlords, even some of less-than-premium spaces, are using Reits' rentals as a yardstick, even though Reits set their rents to commensurate with the efforts put into refurbishing their assets.\n\n\"The more meticulous the non-Reit landlord is, the more he will scour for available benchmark rents, factor in these premium properties rents, strive for negotiation towards his asking rents, and try to ensure negotiation doesn't land up near his reserve rents,\" said R'ST Research's Mr Ong. \"Reits are actually free to set the rents they feel most in sync with the quality of their premium properties, but there is high herding in the market either by other building landlords which are unsure of market rents, or by landlords which are looking to optimise their returns.\"\n\nRefurbishments is one way Reits justify rent increases; the other is their natural incentive to yield higher returns and consequently higher distributions for their unitholders.\n\n\"Even the Reits benchmark their yields and payouts to other Reits,\" said SLP International's Mr Mak. But non-reit landlords have no such practice.\n\nA DTZ Research report released last week found that retail rents in the prime shopping belt grossed $30.23 per square foot in the first quarter, steady from the previous quarter. This is because leasing deals took longer to complete as retailers resisted rent increases to control their occupancy costs, while idealistic landlords held on to their asking prices, it said.\n\nSome other consultants are advising more disciplined and structured studies into understanding the ability of Reits to influence business rents. Alan Cheong, Savills Singapore research head, for instance, recommends stratified studies between \"reited\" and \"non-reited\" malls.\n\nHe said rather than calculating the gross ownership of retail space owned by Reits, it would have been better to stratify the spaces into similar class malls, say, \"prime Orchard Road malls\" or \"suburban retail malls above 100,000 sq ft\" and then compare the rentals between the \"reited\" and \"non-reited\" malls.\n\nBut even that may backfire if there is herding in the market: \"There is the possibility that it may not give you much information because non-reited mall owners may just follow the Reits in setting rents,\" he said.\n\nHe added that such a study is also confounded by variables such as location and size of malls which can have an effect in determining rents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The fund is called the Schroder Global Equity Stabiliser.\n\nInvestors should note, however, that the fund does not offer any guarantees. While the indicated downside for a 12-month period is 15 per cent, it is possible that the cumulative loss over longer periods could exceed 15 per cent.\n\nFor example, two consecutive years of 15 per cent loss in each year could spell an overall loss of more than 28 per cent.\n\nSchroders head of intermediary (South-east Asia) Albert Tse said more Singaporeans are looking to invest outside Singapore with many looking into the US and Europe. \"However, as history has shown, with the 2008 financial crisis and the eurozone sovereign crisis, a sudden market correction or rise in volatility can wipe out all previous gains in a portfolio.\n\n\"Hence, downside risk management has become more important in today's environment and should be built into an investing mechanism.\"\n\nSchroders said it was the first among its peers in Asia to offer the \"stabiliser mechanism'' in a retail fund. It runs portfolios for US and Asian institutions using this strategy.\n\n\"The fund allows investors to have relative peace of mind when tapping the growth potential of global equities,\" Mr Tse said.\n\nThis is how it works: The fund will invest directly into global equities with a bias towards quality and yield. The net portfolio yield is expected to be 4 per cent. The fund has a distribution share class which expects to pay out 3.5 per cent per annum on a monthly basis.\n\nAt the outset, the fund will have a 100 per cent exposure to equities. This is achieved through an allocation into the global equity portfolio of between 85 and 95 per cent. The balance of the fund goes into long futures positions and FX forwards backed by cash.\n\nThe futures positions will correspond to the country exposures of the fund. For instance, US equity will be matched against the S&P500 index; German equities against the DAX; Japan equity against the Topix and so on.\n\nTo dampen fund volatility, the manager may reduce the long futures positions, or take a short position. But the fund is not allowed to leverage - have a net long position of more than 100 per cent. It is also not allowed to take on a net short position.\n\nIn terms of risk or volatility, the system sets a cap of 20 per cent. Fund volatility is monitored. The greater the fund drawdown relative to its highest net asset value in the past 12 months, the lower the cap on fund volatility - that is, the fund becomes less tolerant of risk and equity participation or exposure will decline.\n\nFor example, if fund volatility rises to between 25 and 40 per cent and the drawdown against the highest 12-month NAV ranges from 12 to 15 per cent, then the volatility cap may be set at 5 per cent. In these instances, the net equity exposure would be reduced to 12.5 to 20 per cent.\n\nThere are of course trade-offs to the strategy. While the fund seeks to preserve value on the downside, it is likely to lag on market rallies as it takes some time to ramp up the equity exposure. Unlike the earlier crop of protected and structured funds of the 1990s, Schroders' offering does not use options. This avoids counterparty risk. Listed index futures are also relatively more transparent and efficient in terms of costs.\n\nUsing backtesting through the 2008 crisis and the subsequent recovery in 2009, the market's maximum drawdown in 2008 was around 62 per cent. The fund would have fallen 16.5 per cent during the period. During the subsequent rebound between March and December 2009, Mr Tse said the fund \"was not able to capture 20 to 30 per cent of the upside'' in the first few months of the year. \"But by the third quarter, the fund participation rate was 80 to 90 per cent,\" he said.\n\nTo allow for investor education by its distributor banks, the fund's launch period may be extended past April. The fund is distributed by Citibank, Maybank and United Overseas Bank. \"We need to raise at least $20 million for the fund to be efficient.

Of the five, two are in China, one in South Australia, one in Nigeria and one in Tajikistan.\n\nCMI (formerly Sunshine Holdings) has been incurring losses in its existing real estate development business and continues to face a challenging environment due to higher land prices and austerity measures imposed by the Chinese government, the group said. For the financial year ended Dec 31, 2013, it registered a net loss of 154.7 million yuan (S$31.4 million).\n\nThe acquisition of CME will be partially satisfied by the divestment of Elegant Jade Enterprise, which consists of CMI's entire existing business. These include assets such as residential units in a project in Xinxiang, Henan as well as exploration rights over iron ore mines in Xinjiang and Henan provinces.\n\nGuide True will receive the total issued and paid-up share capital of Elegant Jade at a consideration of some $73.4 million, which represents the net asset value (NAV) of Elegant Jade as at Dec 31, 2013, while the remaining $417.29 million payable will be satisfied through the issue of about 4.63 billion new shares in CMI at an issue price of nine cents per share.\n\nThe issue price of nine cents per share represents a premium of 43.4 per cent to the volume-weighted average price of $0.06275 for each share for trades on March 31, 2014.\n\nCMI is also proposing a share consolidation, in line with the listing rules which require the issue price of each mainboard-listed share to be at least $0.50.\n\nMeanwhile, the $510.73 million payable to CGE for its stake in CME will be satisfied through the issue of about 5.67 billion shares, also at the issue price of nine cents per share.\n\nFollowing the acquisition, CGE and Guide True will directly and indirectly hold about 93.3 per cent of the shares in CMI, taking its free float below the minimum 10 per cent threshold required.\n\nThe company plans to carry out a compliance placement which could include existing shares held by CGE and Guide True and/or the allotment of new shares.\n\nShares in CMI closed at 7.1 cents yesterday, up 1.1 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There won't be a share listing in 2014,\" Michel Sirat told Reuters after the release of CMA CGM's 2013 results. \"In any case, there is no urgency in having a new, different access to equity markets, but it remains a matter being studied because it is a legitimate subject for a group of our size.\"\n\nCMA CGM's issuing of a 300 million euro bond last year and renewed interested from banks in the shipping sector, had boosted the French company's sources of financing, he said.\n\nCMA CGM, based in Marseille, is controlled by founder Jacques Saade and his family.\n\nThe FSI and Turkish group Yildirim are both minority shareholders in CMA CGM through convertible bonds they hold, giving the FSI the equivalent of 6 per cent of shares and Yildirim 24 per cent.\n\nCMA CGM reported stable full-year revenue at US$15.9 billion, as a 7.5 per cent rise in its volumes was offset by a 7.1 per cent drop in its average freight rates.\n\nCore operating profit fell 26.9 per cent to US$756 million but group net profit rose 22.8 per cent to US$408 million, boosted by the sale of 49 per cent of Terminal Link.\n\nCMA CGM expects market conditions in 2014 to be similar to last year's, Mr Sirat said, without giving any company forecasts.\n\nThe container shipping sector continues to face overcapacity, a legacy of a ship order boom that preceded a global financial crisis in 2008.\n\nReporting annual results at the end of February, AP Moller-Maersk, owner of the world's largest container shipping firm Maersk Line, said it expected overcapacity to persist until at least 2016.\n\nLike its larger rival, CMA CGM is aiming to cut costs through a vessel-sharing alliance and the development of larger ships with greater fuel efficiency.\n\nThe so-called P3 alliance will see Maersk Line, CMA CGM and No 2 container shipping group Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) pool vessels on certain routes.\n\nCMA CGM is hoping for a mid-2014 launch, Mr Sirat said in an earlier results call, echoing comments made by Maersk earlier last month. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

As Singapore goes through the transition, he maintained that the goal of improving the lives of the people remained the same.\n\nOne important strategy is to develop better workers and create better jobs, which Mr Lee described as \"the only sustainable way\" to raise wages. He also said it was the collective responsibility of each of the tripartite partners - the government, employers and unions - in Singapore to develop better workers and create better jobs.\n\n\"Workers must make the effort to train and upgrade themselves. Employers must invest in workers, develop their skills, and make full use of their talents.\n\n\"Only then will the government's programmes bear fruit. By working together, we strengthen our model of tripartism, and keep it our lasting advantage.\"\n\nOn its part, the government is growing the economy and creating good jobs for Singaporeans, and strengthening the social safety nets to give people \"more peace of mind\".\n\nIt is also upgrading the skills of workers by investing heavily when it comes to continuous education and training, with two new institutes set up in Jurong and Paya Lebar to enable more people to upgrade themselves and advance their careers.\n\nMr Lee shared how the government was giving generous incentives to help companies raise their productivity and create more opportunities to expand overseas.\n\nThis message of an economy in transition was one that was prominent in nearly all the May Day Messages released this year by Singapore's leaders and the tripartite partners.\n\nLabour chief Lim Swee Say said last Sunday that the labour market will remain tight all the way until 2030 and urged firms to ramp up their efforts to boost productivity and innovation.\n\nWorkers, too, have been told to improve their skills and brace for more changes in the coming years as a result of this economic restructuring.\n\nPM Lee ended his May Day Message with a call for all Singaporeans to honour the contributions and achievements of the pioneer generation that has helped make Singapore what it is today.\n\n\"Our pioneer generation overcame long odds to set Singapore on the path to development. In the unions, many pioneers fought the communists and worked with the government to foster constructive labour-management relations, build a competitive economy and deliver better lives for all.\n\n\"Let us honour them by upholding their spirit, building on their achievements and creating an even better Singapore for our children.\"\n\nMr Lee will join over a thousand unionists in celebrating Labour Day later today at the new Devan Nair Institute for Employment and Employability in Jurong East, where he will deliver the May Day Rally speech.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They also have to be named.\n\nWhere previously the Code allowed for disclosure of remuneration in bands of $250,000, it must now be declared to the nearest $1,000.\n\nShariq Barmaky, audit partner with Deloitte Singapore, said: \"Of particular interest to investors may be the increased disclosure requirements of the remuneration of each director and the CEO on a named basis.\"\n\nThe definition of \"independent director\" has also been revised.\n\nAnnabelle Yip, joint head of corporate governance and compliance practice at WongPartnership, noted that boards are now required to explain why any director who has served on the board beyond nine years should be considered independent. In connection with this, a board may give some insight into the company's approach to the progressive refreshing and renewal of the board, she added.\n\n\"It will also be interesting to see how boards approach the guideline to determine and disclose the maximum number of listed company board representations which a director may hold - whether boards will fix a hard number or take a more flexible approach.\"\n\nInvestors can also look out for better disclosure of risk-management practices. Lucas Tran, audit partner with KPMG Singapore, defining risk management as the act of identifying and managing an event which could cause a company financial or reputational losses, said: \"Principle 11 (which states that the board must be responsible for risk management) addresses this and requires companies to provide information on the adequacy and effectiveness of their risk-management framework, instead of just focusing on internal controls.\"\n\nCompliance with the Code is voluntary, but deviations are expected to be explained in the annual reports. David Gerald, the president of the Securities Investors Association of Singapore, said investors should look for transparent, detailed explanations of such non-compliance: \"Boilerplate statements like 'We have not complied because we have not been able to comply' are not helpful enough. Why have you not been able to comply? What efforts did you make to try to comply?...The reasons for not complying must be clearly explained.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The ferry's crew, operator and regulator face severe punishment over any wrongdoings.\"\n\nPrime Minister Chung Hong Won resigned on Sunday as polls showed support for President Park Geun Hye and the ruling party slipping, and the country's major newspapers accused the government of mishandling its response to the tragedy. Victims' relatives shouted and threw water bottles at Mr Chung, who will remain in office until the government's response has concluded, as he visited them hours after the Sewol sank on April 16.\n\nInvestigators have said that they are probing whether the ferry turned too quickly or abnormally, and whether it was carrying too much cargo, before it listed and sank in an area known for strong currents off the south-west corner of the Korean peninsula. The joint team of coast guard and prosecutors is also investigating why the crew members left the vessel while passengers were still on board.\n\nAll 15 crew members involved in navigating the Sewol survived the sinking and all have been arrested, prosecutor Yang Joong Jin said from Mokpo on Sunday. Coast guard footage showed the captain, who wasn't on the bridge at the time of the incident, boarding a rescue boat dressed only in underwear, with other crew members also boarding not wearing the vessel's uniform. YTN TV identified the crew members.\n\n\"We couldn't ask people whether they're crew or passengers because the situation was too urgent,\" Kim Kyung Il, the captain of one of the first coast guard boats to reach the sinking vessel, said on YTN. \"We didn't know who was a crew member and who was passenger.\"\n\nThe Sewol was already listing as much as 60 degrees when the rescue boat arrived at 9.30am, at which time there were two helicopters and a lifeboat at the scene, Mr Kim said. The coast guard alerted passengers to escape the ferry, but rescuers were unable to reach the bridge to broadcast from inside the vessel due to the severe listing, he said.\n\nSurvivors have said that the crew gave at least two orders between 8.30am and 9am for passengers to don life jackets and remain in their existing locations. Captain Lee Joon Seok, 68, has said that those orders were given because lifeboats hadn't yet arrived and the currents were too strong to evacuate.\n\nMs Park called the actions of the ferry's crew in abandoning passengers on board \"like murder\". The captain, the third mate named Park, who was steering the vessel at the time of the incident, and the helmsman Cho, who was on the bridge with Park, face up to life imprisonment, prosecutor Lee Bong Chang said on Sunday in Mokpo.\n\nUnder Korean law, homicide through occupational negligence carries a penalty of up to five years in prison, while homicide through abandonment carries a prison term of three years or more and a life sentence is possible.\n\nProsecutors raided Mokpo Coast Guard on Sunday to investigate whether it took immediate action after a 911 call originating from a student on the ferry was transferred via an emergency services official, Kim Jae In, a senior inspector at Korea Coast Guard's West Regional Headquarters said.\n\nThe coast guard is still looking at why only one of the 46 lifeboats on the Sewol was properly deployed and why others didn't auto-inflate when they hit the water, Mr Kim said.\n\n\"There are too many irregularities and malpractices in parts of society that have been with us for too long, and I hope those are corrected so that accidents like this will not happen again,\" Mr Chung said in a televised briefing on Sunday to announce his resignation. \"I apologise to the nation for the government's failure to prevent the ferry disaster and to handle the accident properly.\"\n\nMr Chung's resignation should mark the \"beginning of holding those involved accountable\", the JoongAng Ilbo newspaper said in an editorial. \"Given the gravity of the situation and the people's anger, it will not be enough even if every member of the cabinet steps down.\"\n\nMore than two-thirds of the passengers on the Sewol belonged to a group of 339 students and teachers from Danwon High School in Ansan, near Seoul. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

It had accounted for 23 per cent of layoffs in 2010, when the government first laid out its roadmap for restructuring.\n\nAnd, higher operating and labour costs, in part due to deliberate policies to encourage more productive use of land and labour, affected three in 10 workers made redundant last year - higher than the proportion in 2012.\n\nEconomists say that restructuring's mark on the labour market may deepen in coming years, given the Singapore government's commitment to push the economy to productivity-driven growth - backed by multiple rounds of levy hikes and quota cuts to slow foreign manpower growth.\n\n\"Singapore is still in the early stages of restructuring, and I think the share of layoffs due to this will continue to rise,\" said UOB economist Francis Tan.\n\nStandard Chartered economist Jeff Ng agreed that restructuring's impact will continue to show up in layoff numbers.\n\n\"Restructuring remains a multi-year effort and medium-term process,\" he said. \"Given that skills training and upgrading takes time, it may take years for the full impact to materialise.\"\n\nBut the impact from higher costs may be more muted this year.\n\n\"We see costs pass through from businesses to consumers as the economic outlook improves. This will likely help to sustain margins that were eroded by rising costs,\" he added.\n\nAn improved growth outlook also means that the labour market will continue to stay tight - as demand stays high and supply of workers continues to be limited, said Mr Tan. The unemployment rate - which averaged 2.8 per cent for residents last year - is thus likely to stay low this year.\n\nMr Ng also noted that only a small minority of workers laid off in 2013, had been laid off before, and that most residents who found new employment went to a different industry. \"Concerns should only arise if any of these factors deteriorate significantly,\" he said.\n\nAlthough 11,560 workers were laid off last year, an increase from 11,010 in 2012, the total pool of workers had grown too, so the incidence of redundancy remained unchanged from 2012 - 5.8 in 1,000 workers were laid off in 2013.\n\nRobert Walters Singapore's managing director Toby Fowlston thinks the redundancy rate is unlikely to rise. \"We see an increase in volume of jobs as Singapore clearly remains a key economic hub and there is still plenty of hiring activity. The job market continues to be candidate-driven,\" he said.\n\nCertain groups of workers were still more vulnerable to layoffs than others. MOM said that manufacturing workers were most affected, with 13 in every 1,000 employees made redundant in 2013, up from 10 per thousand in 2012.\n\nPMETs (professionals, managers, executives and technicians) were also more vulnerable to redundancy than those holding production or clerical, sales and service jobs. PMETs made up 66 per cent of residents who were laid off, even though they made up only 52 per cent of the workforce in 2013.\n\n\"This possibly reflected the growing vulnerability of mid-level, white-collar workers to job losses due to globalisation and technological innovations. Despite this, the unemployment rate of PMETs remained lower than other occupations,\" the MOM report said.\n\nRecruitment consultancy Kelly Services' vice-president and country general manager Mark Hall observed that some PMETs were \"more choosy\" than they ought to be, while Randstad's Singapore country director Michael Smith thinks retrenched PMETs may need to be more flexible about the jobs they seek and manage their salary expectations.\n\nYesterday, Acting Manpower Minister Tan Chuan-Jin said at MOM's annual work plan seminar that CaliberLink, a career services centre for PMEs, has assisted more than 5,000 workers - 750 of whom found jobs - since March 2011.\n\nThe minister also stressed that restructuring for higher productivity must continue, even as the government is mindful of the need to strike a balance between protecting workers and maintaining Singapore's competitiveness.\n\n\"We understand that many companies are feeling the strain of our foreign manpower tightening measures. During this period of economic restructuring, we are committed to helping employers, especially smaller companies which don't always have the flexibility and scope to make some of these changes,\" he said, citing schemes to support investment in technology, streamline processes and subsidise training for workers.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Even on stage, her songs require people to listen rather than to merely watch.\n\nDressed like a modern-day troubadour, complete with top hat and scarf draped over a casual all-black outfit and wearing shiny gold loafers that glittered under the spotlights, Vega launched into her 90-minute, 15-song and three-encores set with Marlene on the Wall, a standout from her eponymous 1985 album.\n\nHer innate ability to blend frivolity with longing was evident in Caramel, from her 1996 album Nine Objects of Desire:\n\nIt won't do to dream of caramel,\n\nto think of cinnamon and long for you.\n\nIt won't do to stir a deep desire,\n\nto fan a hidden fire that can never burn true.\n\nVega included several songs from her recently-released eighth album Tales from the Realm of the Queen of Pentacles, a title that speaks of the inherent literacy of her lyrics and her idea of fun.\n\nAt the end of each song she simply said a brief \"Thanks\" before moving on to the next one. Once in awhile she would expound a little, as she did before Gypsy, a song she wrote about a summer romance the year she turned 18, bonding with a fellow Leonard Cohen devotee. \"I love Leonard Cohen, but only in certain moods,\" said Vega.\n\nThe same might be said of Vega, although many in the Esplanade audience - comprising mainly expats of a certain vintage and a sprinkling of local fans - would probably disagree. Judging from the enthusiastic reception given her throughout the evening, Vega's effortless renditions likely unleashed a flood of distant memories of days gone by.\n\nVega's most famous song - and one that still receives regular airplay on radio stations throughout the civilised world - is Luka, and it received a near-reverential listening near the end of the set, but it was possibly pipped in popularity that evening by a couple of more \"fun\" songs, indicating perhaps the upbeat mood in the room.\n\nLeft of Center, a song that gained traction as part of the soundtrack from the teen comedy Pretty in Pink (1986), sent a ripple of good vibrations through the room, and the mood was sealed moments later when Vega switched into rebel rocker mode for I Never Wear White, from her new album.\n\nIt was proof positive that the lady in black hasn't lost her touch or the ability to remain rooted in her individuality while staying in tune with the times. The singer is comfortable in her own skin, and the audience was equally content to listen to the truth in her stories - and reminisce.\n\nI never wear white\n\nWhite is for virgins\n\nChildren in summer\n\nBrides in the park.\n\nMy colour is black black black\n\nBlack is for secrets\n\nOutlaws and dancers\n\nFor the poet of the dark.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The investigations are in response to sharp falls in the prices of Asiasons, Blumont and LionGold last October which prompted the Singapore Exchange (SGX) to suspend trading and label the three as \"designated securities\".\n\nSGX and the Monetary Authority of Singapore later that month announced that they were studying trading in the three counters. In a subsequent release, SGX said designation is only used when the market needs to be warned to proceed with extreme caution.\n\nSentiment in penny stocks has generally been weak for the past six months since that crash, though there are hopes that once the current investigations are completed, confidence might return.\n\nPenny stocks which have seen action this week - as well as over the past few months - include China water treatment plays HanKore and Memstar. AddValue Technology has also been in the frame following a recent announcement that it is to sell a subsidiary to a China buyer for $330 million, while Albedo's shares have slipped as doubts linger over a deal involving Johor land assets.\n\nIn the commodities sector, Noble Group this week confirmed month-long rumours that it was to sell its agricultural business to China's Cofco, though the rumours which said the sale would be worth US$1 billion understated the actual price - Noble said the initial payment from Cofco would be US$1.5 billion. Noble's shares, which have been rising sharply in the past few weeks, yesterday fell 3.5 cents to $1.28 with 35 million done. For the week, however, Noble gained seven cents or 5.8 per cent.\n\nAmong the banks, OCBC this week confirmed its takeover of Hong Kong's Wing Hang Bank. Analysts were not wholly convinced as OCBC may have to raise capital; whatever the case, the stock gained 20 cents or 2.1 per cent over the week to end at $9.71.\n\nAmong blue chips, it was the Jardine group which stood out by virtue of its influence on the STI and also because of questions over its application to downgrade its premium listing status in London to standard status.\n\nIn a midweek letter to BT, finance professor Mak Yuen Teen questioned Jardine's listing status on SGX once its London application is passed since it appears that the group, which only has secondary listing status here, will also end up with a lower status in London. This, according to Prof Mak, raises governance issues since without a primary listing, the group would be subject to less stringent requirements.\n\nAlso questioned was Jardine's inclusion in the STI since stocks with a standard listing in London are not eligible for membership in FTSE indices. In response, SGX said it was in discussion with Jardine but cannot reveal details.\n\nOn the external front, Wall Street's strength and China's announcement of fresh stimulus measures helped bolster confidence. These include cutting tax for micro and small businesses, setting up special units in funding social housing and urban infrastructure, and seeking new ways for funding and speeding up railway construction. In response, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said it expected sequential QoQ growth to bottom out in Q1 at 1.4 per cent and rebound to around 1.8 per cent in Q2-Q4.\n\n\"We maintain our annual GDP growth forecast at 7.2 per cent. We believe the chance for China to be hit by a nationwide financial collapse is extremely small, and we think the market is overly bearish on China,\" it said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Instead, while the exterior retains its original visage, the interior was given an extensive overhaul last year at the cost of more than 30 million euros (S$52 million).\n\nEven so, much care was taken to retain as much of the classical architecture while the existing rooms were retrofitted into brighter, contemporary spaces. If money is not an issue, check into the Antonio Machado suite, named after the acclaimed poet from Seville who stayed at the hotel during the Spanish civil war in 1938. It's not a shrine as such but a modern outfitted abode that is also the largest room in the hotel. While it wasn't part of the main renovation, the room has been updated and is a tribute to the poet and all things literary, with framed photos and poems of Machado presiding over a collection of books.\n\nFood-wise, the hotel's signature restaurant Drolma was moved from the top floor to the first level and re-invented as an all-day dining space which features one of the largest breakfast buffets in the city. Don't forget to load up on its addictive bikini sandwiches - thin toasted bread slices encasing a salty, gooey filling of jamon and melted cheese. Otherwise, indulge in modern Spanish tapas at its slick Majestic Bar with its comprehensive list of local wines and cava, as well as international big names. The menu features Catalan produce, including the \"best anchovy-stuffed olives in the world\", avocado and tuna tartare cannelloni and prawn carpaccio.\n\nThe main attraction of the Majestic is also its location on Barcelona's \"Orchard Road\" - Passeig de Gracia and its collection of upscale boutiques and proximity to star attractions like Plaza de Catalunya with its giant El Cortes Ingles department store, and La Rambla with its famed market La Boqueria.\n\nAnd, of course, it's just a stone's throw from the Gaudi landmarks. So after viewing your fill of art history, you can go back and sleep in a hotel that's steeped in it.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

At its annual general meeting on May 20, Royal Dutch Shell is set to bring aboard two additional female directors, including Singaporean Euleen Goh, to its board.\n\nNo window dressing, it underlines strong intent, voiced earlier by Shell chairman Jorma Ollila, that it is important for Shell to improve the diversity of its board, where women and people of different ethnicities are under-represented. It is also crucial for the group to have a director from Asia Pacific, given the region's increasing importance to its overall business, he stressed. Shell intends for a quarter of its board to be female by 2015, including the addition of a member with an Asia-Pacific background, Mr Ollila had promised back in 2012.\n\nThe latter is significant for Singapore, especially with Pulau Bukom/Jurong Island now Shell's largest manufacturing site worldwide - which is similarly the case for US rival ExxonMobil, which has ploughed billions of dollars here - and also for Asia, a region driving global economic growth. So come May, Shell will at least achieve one of its targets in having an Asia-Pacific director, and advance closer to its other target of 25 cent female board representation, in having three women among its 14 directors. Also coming aboard at Shell is Patricia Woertz, chairman, CEO and president of Archer Daniels Midland Company, who will bring with her invaluable oil industry experience from her time at Gulf Oil and Chevron.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 4, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nThe Scarlet\n\n33 Erskine Road\n\nwww.thescarlethotels.com\n\nWHEN The Scarlet opened a decade ago, it was not for the faint-hearted. The boutique hotel was decked out in strong shades of black, gold and, of course, scarlet.\n\nBut even after undergoing a five-month rejuvenation last year, the hotel has not lost its luxurious touch. The idea is to think of Scarlet as a woman undergoing a little nip-and-tuck to look young and fresh again, but she is still as alluring as before.\n\nGone are her strong, dark brows and bright red lips. This time, Scarlet has chosen a more contemporary makeup palette using brighter colours such as turquoise, mustard, sapphire and violet. \"After 10 years, we felt it was time for a rejuvenation,\" says Vivian Tung, marketing and communications director for Grace International, which owns the hotel. The company also owns the boutique Huntington Hotel in San Francisco.\n\n\"The new look is still boudoir-like, and very much European-inspired, which is what The Scarlet is all about,\" says Ms Tung. \"This time, the hotel takes its inspiration from fashion.\"\n\nInternational interior design firm Aedas Interiors is behind the hotel's new look. Simon Thompson, executive principal of Aedas Interiors Singapore, says he was inspired by the enigmatic and gracious hostess herself, \"Scarlet\", when designing the revamp. \"The new interior personifies the characteristics, taste, and multi-faceted personality of Scarlet, by conjuring ambiences and design elements that are bold, fashionable and glamourous.\"\n\nMost of the $6 million transformation is evident in the public areas, the hotel's five suites and at Breeze, its famed rooftop bar.\n\nA pair of new golden ornate water feature walls on each side of the lobby entrance is what guests see first, when they step into the hotel. The $20,000 chandelier, the centrepiece of the lobby, has been kept as part of the rejuvenation, so that the lobby does not lose its grandeur.\n\nThe lobby's previous heavy-looking chairs, that were decked out in shades of red are now gone. The look is now cleaner and less dated. Upholstered seating refinished with luxurious Sonia Christian Lacroix velvets in cobolt, chartreuse mustard and garnet red, provide comfort for waiting guests. On the walls, tanned nude wall panels, upon closer inspection, reveal stitches inspired by lace stockings.\n\nThe Bold lounge, which once had a somewhat moody look with black armchairs, now takes on a more playful feel. A mirror wall covered with floral decals makes the space feel slightly larger. A zebra-striped plush carpet done in shades of purple and red adds to the fun. In place of paisley print sofas, there are now smaller chairs done in graphically patterned black, spring green, purple shades and fuchsia.\n\nGemstone-inspired palettes take centre stage in the hotel's five suites. They still retain their names: Splendour, Swank, Opulent, Lavish and Passion, but now have a contemporary look.\n\nThe hotel's signature suite, Passion, is now more edgy with python, patent leather and leopard prints on its furniture. In keeping with its name, garnet red wallpaper is used in this room, but it is no ordinary wallpaper. Ms Tung reveals that the wallpaper behind the four-posted bed has six layers of embossed printing to give it a luxe, textured look.\n\nThe Lavish suite is decked out in invigorating colour palettes of ruby, sapphire and yellow, but that is not its main draw. It is instead the world-renowned Hastens bed. The $38,500 bed is touted as the best bed in the world. And with a fairly extensive pillow menu, guests will have no problems falling asleep.\n\nUp on Breeze, its rooftop bar, guests as well as the public can take in sights of the city skyline.

The stall occurred even as consumer spending on services rose by the most in 14 years.\n\nGross domestic product (GDP) grew at a 0.1 per cent annualised rate from January through March, compared with a 2.6 per cent gain in the prior quarter, figures from the Commerce Department showed yesterday in Washington. The median forecast of 83 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 1.2 per cent increase.\n\nHousehold purchases rose at a 3 per cent pace, spurred by utility outlays and spending on health care tied to President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nThe pullback in growth came as snow blanketed much of the eastern half of the country, keeping shoppers from stores, preventing builders from breaking ground and raising costs for companies. Gains in retail sales, employment and manufacturing at the end of the quarter indicate the setback will be temporary, so Federal Reserve policymakers will probably take little heed.\n\n\"So much of this is conditioned by that anomalous drop in exports and inventories and by the weather effect, and if anything, one expects more of a rebound in the second quarter,\" said Samuel Coffin, an economist at UBS Securities LLC in New York, who projected a 0.5 per cent gain in GDP.\n\nCompanies added more workers in April than at any time in the previous five months, signalling further progress in the labour market, a private payrolls report also showed yesterday.\n\nThe 220,000 increase in employment followed a revised 209,000 gain the prior month that was stronger than initially estimated, according to figures yesterday from the New Jersey-based ADP Research Institute. The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an advance of 210,000 in April.\n\nEconomists' projections for GDP ranged from unchanged to 2 per cent. Yesterday's estimate is the first of three for the quarter, with the next reading scheduled for May 29, at which point more data will be available.\n\nFor all of 2013, the economy expanded 1.9 per cent after a 2.8 per cent gain in the prior year.\n\nThe gain in consumer purchases, which account for about 70 per cent of the economy, exceeded the 2 per cent median forecast in the Bloomberg survey. Personal consumption added two percentage points to growth. Spending climbed at a 3.3 per cent pace in the last three months of 2013.\n\nWhile the wintry weather held back purchases of goods, which climbed at a 0.4 per cent pace - the least in almost two years - it also boosted outlays on utilities to keep warm, and did little to prevent Americans from taking advantage of the ACA, which the Commerce Department said boosted spending.\n\nExpenditures on services climbed at a 4.4 per cent pace, the biggest gain since the second quarter of 2000. Outlays of health care jumped by US$43.3 billion at an annualised rate to US$1.85 trillion. It contributed 1.1 percentage points to growth, the most since quarterly records began in 1947.\n\nAcceleration in economic growth going forward will depend on a pick-up in consumer activity, which hinges on further labour market progress.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth/wealth-investing/commodities-rally-us-weather-ukraine-crisis", "site_title": "Commodities rally on US weather, Ukraine crisis", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nCommodities rally on US weather, Ukraine crisis\n\nBut Citi and Goldman say rally won't last as supply surpluses start to emerge\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Apr 1, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nA YEAR after Citigroup Inc declared the decade-long run of commodity gains over, wacky weather, dead piglets and Vladimir Putin have gotten in the way. While Citigroup rang \"death bells\" in April 2013 for the synchronised super cycle fuelled by economic growth in China, extreme weather and supply squeezes led to surprise rallies in 2014's first three months.\n\nCoffee hit a two-year high, cattle and hogs rose to records and nickel had its best quarter since 2010. Gold rebounded from the worst rout in 32 years after Mr Putin's incursion into Ukraine's Crimea region set off the biggest standoff between Russia and the United States since the Cold War. Commodities are \"still a powerful hedge\", said Rob Haworth, a Seattle-based senior investment strategist at US Bank Wealth Management, which oversees US$115 billion. \"Things happen that we don't anticipate, whether it's an invasion in Ukraine or twice as much snow in the middle of America as we normally get. Our clients benefit from having a little exposure to protect against the unanticipated.\"\n\nCommodities topped returns for stocks, bonds and currencies, the first quarterly outperformance against all asset classes since 2012. New York-based Citigroup and Goldman Sachs Group Inc say the rally won't last as supply surpluses start to emerge in everything from sugar to zinc. Investors who poured US$1.55 billion into gold funds this year pulled a net US$66 million from all raw materials, including base metals and energy, EPFR Global data show.\n\nLast year's calls by the two US banks coincided with an economic slowdown in China, the world's biggest consumer of everything from copper to cotton. Chinese gross domestic product is projected to expand 7.3 per cent this year, the weakest rate since 1990, according to the median estimate of 53 economists.\n\nCitigroup, which called the end of the super cycle in November 2012, said in a report on Monday that the \"sunset\" of rising prices is marked by a breakdown in correlations between raw materials. Analysts led by Ed Morse, the global head of commodities research, said in a March 25 report that investor interest in the asset class could \"re-awaken\" as some commodities rise and others fall.\n\n\"We continue to believe the commodity super cycle is over,\" Aakash Doshi, a Citigroup Global Markets vice president in New York, said on March 28. \"That doesn't mean that there is going to be an absence of seasonality and cyclical turns in the asset market. The first quarter was driven a lot by geopolitical and weather events. Commodities will probably return to their more historical norm of behaving more disparately, but just still on a general downward trend.\"\n\nThe large first-quarter gains reflected \"transient shocks\" for individual markets, Jeffrey Currie, Goldman's head of commodities research in New York, said on March 31. \"They were basically one-off events. Before I'm going to get excited about commodities, I want to see underlying cyclical strength, and we don't see that right now.\"\n\nThe Standard & Poor's GSCI Total Return Index of metals, fuels and farm products advanced 2.9 per cent in the first three months of 2014. The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities in 44 markets rose 1.2 per cent, including dividends. The Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Broad Market Index returned 2.2 per cent as at March 28. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.4 per cent. The commodity gauge was little changed at 4,969.51 by 1.24pm in Singapore yesterday.\n\nAbout US$200 billion was added to worldwide share values in the first quarter. The S&P 500 rose 1.3 per cent following the biggest annual rally in 16 years. Utilities and healthcare companies led gains. Prospects that the Federal Reserve could lift its target rate for overnight loans between banks sooner than had been anticipated caused the Treasury yield curve, or the difference between short and longer-maturity debt, to flatten over the quarter.\n\nThe gap in yields between US Treasury five-year notes and 30-year bonds dropped in March to the smallest in four years as economic growth beat estimates. Short and medium-maturity Treasuries tumbled, with yields rising, after Fed Chair Janet Yellen suggested on March 19 that the central bank may end bond- buying in the fall and raise borrowing costs six months later.\n\nNew Zealand's dollar was the top-performing currency over the quarter as its nation's central bank raised its key interest rate to become the first from a major developed nation to exit record-low borrowing costs. The kiwi, as New Zealand's currency is known, in March reached the highest versus the US dollar since August 2011 and gained 5.7 per cent in the quarter, relative to 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the US currency versus 10 major counterparts, ended the month down 0.1 per cent and the quarter down 0.4 per cent at 1,015.77. Commodity prices had tripled in the 11 years since 2001, before dropping in 2013 as gold, copper and corn slumped into bear markets and investors pulled a record US$43.3 billion from commodity funds tracked by EPFR Global. Geopolitical events and weather contributed to world food costs posting the biggest gain in 19 months in February, led by sugar, dairy, grain and cooking oils, the Rome-based United Nations' Food & Agriculture Organization said. Consumers in the US, the largest economy, may pay as much as 3.5 per cent more for food this year, the Department of Agriculture has forecast.\n\n\"If you were shorting a commodity in the last decade, you got your face ripped off,\" said Peter Sorrentino, a senior portfolio manager who helps manage about US$4.7 billion at Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati. \"When money came in, it didn't care, it just came into the entire space. Now, we're back to a case where you can go long and you can short. Money is being made by really picking winners and losers.\"\n\nThe biggest advance in the quarter was in agriculture, where money managers boosted their bets on higher prices fivefold since December and are now the most-bullish in three years, holding 1.06 million US futures and options contracts, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.\n\nArabica coffee on ICE Futures US in New York jumped 61 per cent, the biggest quarterly gain since 1997 and the most among the 24 commodities tracked by the GSCI Spot Index. South-east Brazil, the largest grower, is having the driest summer since 1972, and a crop disease called leaf rust has cut production by as much as 35 per cent in Central America. Arabica may average as much as US$2.25 a pound over the next several quarters, Citigroup said. Last year's average was about US$1.27.\n\nHog futures in Chicago advanced 49 per cent, the biggest quarterly gain in 15 years, on mounting concern that a deadly pig virus will tighten pork supplies. Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus, which is deadly to piglets, has been reported in 27 states since April, with more than 5,000 total cases. Pork output in the US, the biggest exporter, may drop by the most in three decades this year, Rabobank International estimates.\n\nWheat reached a 10-month high on March 20, and corn's 19 per cent rally since the end of December marked the first gain in six quarters and pushed the grain into a bull market on Monday. Some metals also rebounded. Nickel jumped 14 per cent, the most in three years, after a ban on ore exports by Indonesia, the biggest producer of the mined metal. Gold, which plunged 28 per cent in 2013 as investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value, rose in the first three months of the year by 6.8 per cent.\n\nAssets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded fund backed by bullion, are up 1.9 per cent this year, after a 41 per cent drop in 2013 that wiped US$41.8 billion in value. Gold's new-found appeal will be short-lived because the reasons for the rally are temporary, Goldman's Currie said in a March 20 report. Prices fell the most in three months on March 19, after Ms Yellen said that monetary stimulus will end this year.\n\nBrent crude, the global oil benchmark, fell during the quarter on speculation the Ukraine crisis will not disrupt oil supplies and amid signs that Chinese demand growth is slowing. Futures averaged US$107.92 a barrel, down 4.2 per cent from a year earlier and the lowest for a first quarter since 2011. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/949e63e9cb5ae4bcfc9962e1e3783ce5e383b8c71eae5105273b8b7ca6706009?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Big gains: About US$200 billion was added to worldwide share values in the first quarter.

OCBC is offering HK$125 in cash for each Wing Hang share, which comes up to HK$38.43 billion (S$6.23 billion) in total - lower than the S$6.7 billion estimated by the Street.\n\nEven so, this deal is the largest by a local bank since DBS's US$5.8 billion purchase of Hong Kong's Dao Heng Bank in 2001. The addition of Wing Hang to its pockets will be accretive to OCBC's earnings per share and return on equity by 2017, the bank said. On a pro-forma basis, Wing Hang would have increased the full-year pre-tax contribution from Greater China to OCBC from 6 per cent to 16 per cent in 2013, post-acquisition.\n\nWing Hang's founding Fung family, their affiliates, related family trusts and BNY International Financing Corporation have agreed to sell a total of 44.79 per cent of Wing Hang shares to OCBC. Commitments from other Wing Hang shareholders will bring OCBC's share of the bank to 50.66 per cent.\n\nIf OCBC is able to acquire 100 per cent of Wing Hang, the former intends to delist it from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Group CEO Samuel Tsien said at a media briefing yesterday. Standard & Poor's said yesterday that it had affirmed its AA- long-term and A-1+ short-term issuer credit ratings on OCBC.\n\n\"We affirmed the rating because we believe OCBC's financial profile will remain unaffected despite the bank's proposed acquisition of Hong Kong-based Wing Hang Bank Ltd,\" said Standard & Poor's credit analyst Chris Lee.\n\nOCBC's counter took a beating earlier this year when the market expected a pricier deal. From $10.18 at the start of 2014, it had shed almost 11 per cent to $9.09 by February.\n\nAsked about OCBC's offer being lower than expected, Mr Tsien said that he believes that the offer price is \"fair and equitable\".\n\n\"It recognises the value that Wing Hang has in this franchise and . . . we think it's a fair deal for the selling shareholders as well as the acquiring entity,\" he said.\n\nWing Hang's counter closed 20 cents or 0.16 per cent higher at HK$123.20 yesterday.\n\nThe deal will be funded through a mix of internal resources, new debt and equity capital. It will also be OCBC's first purchase which involves funding through equity, in a departure from its previous acquisitions or investments.\n\n\"We have the opportunity to acquire the entire issued share capital of Wing Hang, so as a result of that, from a prudent capital management perspective, it is right for us to look at a funding plan that involves both debt and equity,\" Mr Tsien said. How much OCBC will raise depends on the outcome of its general offer for Wing Hang. \"It is our intention to make sure that our capital adequacy will always be at a prudent level with a sufficient cushion above the regulatory minimum,\" Mr Tsien added.\n\nHe also said that OCBC does not envisage selling its stake in Great Eastern Holdings to raise funds for this purchase. The acquisition is expected to lower OCBC's total capital adequacy ratio from 16.3 per cent to 12.5 per cent, before any capital raising.\n\nFor some analysts, the deal's price and capital structure were in line with expectations, with the offer translating to a price-to-book ratio of 1.77.\n\n\"Investors may be relieved that pricing is reasonable . . . and did not resort to financing engineering (such as allowing Wing Hang shareholders to receive special dividend prior to acquisition) to seal the deal,\" said UOB Kay Hian analyst Jonathan Koh in a note yesterday.\n\nEven so, Phillip Securities Research's Benjamin Ong noted: \"At a price-to-book ratio of 1.77, there's still a premium attached for strategic control of a mid-sized bank, especially if we strip out Wing Hang's final dividend from the book value, as well as the property revaluation reserve. So, in fact, the offer value is about 2.02 times, price-to-book.\"\n\nThis deal will be more than just a way for OCBC to gain better access to mainland China - it will be a way for OCBC to capitalise on the money moving between North Asia and South-east Asia, said Mr Tsien.\n\n\"The flows that we are seeing (between the two regions) - the US$600 billion trade flow, the US$11 billion investment flow in 2013 alone - it's a big market that only regional banks will be able to tap into,\" he said. At the same time, Wing Hang's presence in Hong Kong and Macau will give OCBC a shot at the offshore renminbi (RMB) market. \"It is the market that we have to access. I need that base in order to build further into offshore RMB products,\" Mr Tsien said.\n\nOn top of that, OCBC will have access to a wider pool of affluent retail customers to whom it can cross-sell wealth management products, he added. Even so, other facets of Wing Hang's exposure have given some market-watchers pause.\n\n\"Hong Kong residential mortgage and China loans together accounted for 38 per cent of Wing Hang Bank's loan book. We are concerned about this exposure as Hong Kong property prices are declining and cases of mainland bond defaults are increasing,\" said Krishna Guha, an equity analyst with Jefferies Singapore. \"While Wing Hang's (loan-to-deposit ratio) may be raised from the current 76 per cent, we think the current credit cycle warrants some caution. Also, given potential interest rate liberalisation, we doubt if the combined entity would have any funding advantage.\"\n\nThis offer is conditional on regulatory approval and on OCBC getting acceptances that amount to more than 50 per cent of Wing Hang shares, among other things. Preliminarily, regulatory approvals for the deal and the dispatch of the offer document are likely to take place by June, with the offer closing by August.\n\nIf the deal goes through, OCBC will keep the employees of Wing Hang and its subsidiaries on for at least the following 18 months.\n\nWhere integration of operations between the two entities was concerned, Mr Tsien was optimistic. \"There is definitely cultural fit between the two organisations of OCBC and Wing Hang,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But some are beginning to worry that an unintended consequence could be a mounting level of bad debt in the system.\n\nThe good news is that, according to published data by the BoJ, Japan's \"recent economic recovery has had positive effect on the profits of financial institutions through gains from investment in stocks, sales of investment trusts and decrease in credit costs\".\n\nThe bad news is that \"core profitability (of banks) relating to deposits and loans has remained on downward trend, mainly due to the continued narrowing of interest rate spreads on loans\" while \"business conditions among regional financial institutions are particularly severe\".\n\nThis \"does not immediately affect the stability or functions of the overall financial system\", the BoJ said, but the decline in core profitability \"is a challenge that should be resolved because it may constrain financial institutions' ability to absorb losses and take on risks\".\n\nBoJ officials declined to comment on the record about these trends but there are expressions of concern among some of them in private. Japan pulled through a massive banking crisis in the 1990s after the collapse of its bubble economy and it has had a long fight back to good health.\n\nWhile the Japanese banking system did recover quite robustly, bank lending stagnated in line with the stagnant economy as neither business nor consumers were anxious to take on new credit while they continued paying down old debts.\n\nAll this changed when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Liberal Democratic Party swept to political power in Japan at the end of 2012 and Mr Abe installed a new governor at the BoJ, Haruhiko Kuroda, to spearhead an aggressive monetary drive aimed at ending deflation and reviving the economy.\n\nA key part of this drive was for the BoJ to make huge purchases of government bonds and other financial assets from banks so that they in turn could turn on the credit taps for Japanese business and consumers. The central bank pumped out term loans at guaranteed low interest rates to push banks into lending.\n\nBut analysts say Japanese firms are not responding to \"Abenomics\" in the hoped-for way by investing in new plant and equipment and borrowing money to finance such investment. Also, loans for housing and durables are liable to be hit by the recent sales tax hike in Japan.\n\nThe upshot of all this is that Japanese banks - a plethora of smaller regional banks in particular - are now competing aggressively for what lending business is available, driving down spreads in the process and risking an erosion in credit quality.\n\nAt the same time, banks located in those still many regions of Japan that have yet to feel the full benefit of Abenomics are invading the turf of bigger banks in cities and urban areas, again driving down profitability and risking a potential rise in non-performing loans.\n\nAnother factor involved is that huge swathes of Japanese manufacturing business have moved abroad in recent years, so much so that a good deal of financing for new investment is also done offshore. This also means that Japan's exports are not responding as hoped to the weaker yen.\n\nFinance officials will not say so openly but what they appear to fear is that the financial system continues to be pumped full of new liquidity which could contribute to an asset bubble and a rise in non-performing loans rather than fuelling new domestic investment and consumption.\n\nThe BoJ warned in its latest Financial System Report published this month that \"attention should be paid to the possibility that the impact of an economic downturn and a rise in interest rates (might) spread to the financial system depending on the speed and extent of (such) a downturn\".\n\nSome financial institutions, the BoJ added rather ominously, \"have relatively weak capital bases and are behind the curve in improving asset quality following the Lehman shock (in 2008). These institutions need to steadily strengthen their capital\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Cost pressures are not expected to abate anytime soon.\n\nFor most readers, however, what probably caught attention in particular in the 99-page report was a little feature on consumer price differentials that says much about the strength of the Singapore economy. No doubt prompted by an Economist Intelligence Unit survey published early last month that - quite curiously - ranked Singapore as the world's most expensive city to live in, the MAS and the Ministry of Trade and Industry jointly commissioned a study on the extent to which prices of internationally branded goods differ between Singapore and other major cities. The findings - from an analysis focused on three global retail brands Apple, Ikea and Zara - confirm what many globally savvy Singaporeans already know: Prices of certain international branded goods cost more here than elsewhere. The study, while confined to those three brands (across some 650 products in all), gives some perspective to all the anecdotal notions. Prices in Singapore are above the median level in two-thirds of the products and below the median for one quarter of them. The trend is similar whether or not sales tax is factored in. And where prices are higher here, the price premium generally does not exceed 20 per cent. Overall, for most items, Singapore is neither the cheapest nor the most expensive among the 11 cities compared.\n\nThe big question is: What accounts for the higher prices in Singapore? The study attributes it largely to cost and demand factors - a conclusion that would square with intuitive reasoning. Indeed, operating costs - notably retail rentals - are not low in Singapore, going by regional or even global yardsticks. On a unit basis, the cost would be further skewed by its small market size. There is also the exchange rate factor. It is why a Bottega or Hermes handbag costs significantly more here than in Europe. More pertinently perhaps, relatively high prices in Singapore reflect in many cases the affluence of the consumer market. Retailers price their goods according to what they believe the market can bear - this has been the established pricing strategy, at least in the bricks and mortar retail world. But now, with the advent of e-commerce, as consumers everywhere - including Singapore - shop by clicking on a keyboard, price differentials across cities look set to narrow, if not eventually disappear when online shopping becomes the norm. According to PayPal's research, the size of the Singapore online shopping market reached $1.1 billion in 2010, and is forecast to hit $4.4 billion in 2015. As e-commerce takes hold, \"pricey in Singapore\" will become less and less of a phenomenon for consumers here.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Approval for the valuation as well as the amount of stake to be offered in the IPO, planned for September, will be sought from Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, he said.\n\nVietnam is speeding share offerings, with a target to sell stakes in more than 400 state-run companies by the end of next year, as part of efforts to restructure the economy and lure more overseas investors. The carrier is one of the biggest state-owned companies being considered for stake sales in the country.\n\n\"Foreign investors are very interested in buying a stake in Vietnam Airlines as it is among a few large-size SOEs (state-owned enterprises) that operate profitably,\" said Alan Pham, Ho Chi Minh City-based chief economist at VinaCapital Group, Vietnam's biggest fund manager that oversees about US$1.6 billion of assets. \"It is considered a crown jewel of state companies.\"\n\nVietnam Air expects to carry 15.8 million passengers this year, compared with 14.7 million in 2013, Mr Minh said. Revenue is estimated to have risen 4.5 per cent to 14.6 trillion dong (S$870.4 million) in the three months ended March, he said.\n\nThe government has been trying to conduct an IPO of the state-owned Vietnam Air since at least 2010 amid intensifying domestic competition.\n\nVietJet Aviation Joint Stock Co, a privately owned airline, in February said that it is considering sale and leaseback of aircraft and a share sale to help pay for the 100 Airbus planes that it has ordered.\n\nVietnam Air is counting on the gains in the country's key index to attract investors. The benchmark VN Index of Vietnamese stocks has risen 14 per cent this year, making it the best performer in South-east Asian markets. The measure rose 0.3 per cent as at 10.02 am local time yesterday.\n\n\"Investors will always study and have strategic vision when considering to invest in a big-scale SOEs like Vietnam Airlines,\" Mr Minh said. The performance of the stock market will also have a \"good impact\" and contribute to the success of the IPO, he added.\n\nVietnam Air said in September that it worked with advisers including Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc to evaluate its assets for equitisation.\n\nThe carrier completed the corporate evaluation process in February and is awaiting the government's approval and expects to announce the value early next month, Mr Minh said.\n\n\"Vietnam Airlines can be a successful IPO,\" said VinaCapital's Pham. \"But the government should reduce its stake to below 50 per cent so that private investors feel they have the power to bring in new management and make fundamental improvements in its operations.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/7f53aaea0526054f259e169d2be3025d5f2af29068e531735bf01a1f021e725c?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Ready for take-off: Vietnam Airlines has been valued at US$2.74 billion and will offer a suitable stake based on market demand, says its chief executive officer Pham Ngoc Minh. - PHOTO: BLOOMBERG"}]}

Double Eagle, with partner Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, moves Eagle Ford condensate to Magellan's Corpus terminal.\n\nOn Monday, Magellan said it had forged a take-or-pay agreement with Trafigura for the 50,000 bpd splitter project, and said the company could build a second 50,000 bpd splitter if demand warrants. Pending permit approvals, the project will start up in the second half of 2016.\n\nA condensate splitter \"splits\" the very light oil into different components, such as naphtha and distillates, which can be blended into refined products, sold or exported. About half of the Eagle Ford's growing output is condensate, a very light form of crude oil that has limited demand from refineries and petrochemical plants. The US Energy Information Administration projects Eagle Ford output to reach 1.36 million bpd in April.\n\nUnder current US law, condensate is considered crude oil and cannot be exported without a licence unless it has undergone at least minimal processing. Surging onshore output of crude oil has prompted some energy companies to call for a lifting of US restrictions on crude oil exports. But any policy shift may take years.\n\nLate last year, Magellan chief executive Mike Mears told Reuters that he saw demand for as many as six to eight condensate splitters along the US Gulf Coast to turn condensate into exportable products.\n\nIn addition to the splitter, the project will include more than one million barrels of new storage, dock improvements and two more truck bays at Magellan's terminal and a pipeline connection to Trafigura's nearby storage and marine terminal.\n\nTrafigura also has another deal to take incoming crude and condensate.\n\nLast year, Trafigura forged a 10-year deal with pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners to take 100 per cent of throughput from its Rio Bravo pipeline, a 135km natural gas line from McMullen County in the Eagle Ford to Corpus being converted to move crude and condensate.\n\nIn a February investor presentation, Energy Transfer described the Rio Bravo project, saying it would connect to a Trafigura \"splitter and terminal\" in Corpus Christi. Rio Bravo is slated to start up in the late third quarter or early fourth quarter this year.\n\nTrafigura spokeswoman Marisol Espinosa declined to say whether Trafigura had planned its own splitter, but noted that investing in a facility with crude and condensate processing capability was \"certainly one of various options we have considered\".\n\nKinder Morgan is building two 50,000 bpd splitters at its Houston Ship Channel complex, with the first slated to start up this summer and the second in early 2015. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

In China, the final Markit/HSBC Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) gauge of factory activity, fell to an eight-month low of 48.0 in March, also boding ill for regional activity.\n\nFinance Minister Taro Aso said the next few months will represent a \"critical stage\" when the government will need to consider actions to prevent consumer spending and investment from stalling in the wake of the tax hike.\n\nSuch actions are likely to take the form of further fiscal and/or monetary stimulus to the economy, analysts said. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is intent on maintaining politically important economic growth while Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda is likewise intent on meeting the 2 per cent annual inflation goal he set last year.\n\nIndustrial output and consumer spending have been running at brisk levels in recent months in the run-up to the sales tax hike. Figures released yesterday showed a sharp 17.4 per cent rise in March sales of motor vehicles from a year earlier while consumer durables sales also surged.\n\nThe tankan suggested, however, that these may have been temporary gains. While the index measuring confidence among major manufacturers of cars and high-tech goods rose for a fifth consecutive quarter to plus-17 in March from plus-16 in December, it is forecast to plunge to plus-8 by June.\n\nData released earlier this week showed that industrial output had unexpectedly dropped by 2.3 per cent in February after many months of rising production, and while this was attributed by the government to snow storms during the month, some economists see it as evidence of corporate uncertainty.\n\nThe BoJ's Mr Kuroda has indicated he will not hesitate to apply further monetary stimulus to the economy, beyond the doubling of the nation's monetary base within two years that he pledged a year ago, if there is evidence growth and the central bank's inflation target are in jeopardy.\n\nSome analysts believe that such action could come as early as this month when the BoJ's Policy Board holds its next regular monthly meeting.\n\nFurther fiscal stimulus is problematic given Japan's already strained fiscal conditions. Kyodo reported yesterday that the government estimates the tax hike to 8 per cent will raise tax revenues by about 5 trillion yen (S$61 billion) annually in fiscal 2014 and around 8 trillion yen every year after fiscal 2015. But the government unveiled a 5.5 trillion yen stimulus package late last year and there are fears that this may not be enough to cushion the negative impact of the tax hike, especially given the unclear outlook for the global economy, Kyodo said.\n\nMr Aso meanwhile insisted the consumption tax hike is \"very significant\" for ensuring the credibility of Japanese Government Bonds. With Japan suffering regular current account deficits, the prospect of having to import capital to finance internal deficits is rising. The consumption tax is scheduled to rise further to 10 per cent in October next year, although Mr Abe has made it clear that he retains the discretion to delay that increase.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Investors swooned at the sweet prospects of the company, which was aggressively picking up mining assets to reinvent itself.\n\nThen, October happened and LionGold's shares were pummelled; what was once a gilded stock soon became a trade-with-extreme caution counter. Its market value stands at a humbling $154 million.\n\nYet, business needs to carry on. Referring to its plans to raise up to $39.70 million, the firm said on Monday that the sum will be largely used for its gold-mining operations. It will issue 37.3 million shares at 13.4 cents apiece to six individuals - Singaporean and Malaysian private investors and business individuals independently identified by the firm's directors.\n\nThe exercise will raise $5 million.\n\nThe firm also plans to issue two tranches of unsecured redeemable convertible bonds due in 2017: The first tranche, involving $15 million, will be subscribed by two private investors, Awang Ahmad Sah and Vigneswaran Subramaniam; LionGold's non-executive chairman Nik Ibrahim Kamil will subscribe to the second tranche of bond issues with a principal amount of $20 million.\n\nBoth bonds, which carry a 5 per cent a year interest rate, can be converted to shares at 16 cents a piece.\n\nAfter the issue of subscription shares and full conversion of bonds into shares, LionGold's consolidated net tangible asset per share will fall to 25.13 cents from 27.49 cents as at end March 2013. Consolidated loss per share will change to 0.73 cents from 0.94 cents.\n\nLionGold's shares finished 0.7 per cent lower at 14.9 cents yesterday. On Monday, the day of the announcement, the shares rose nearly 7 per cent.\n\nThe counter has gained some ground since its low of 9.1 cents on March 6. However, it is nowhere close to its dizzying peak of $1.725 last August.\n\nIn the meantime, the aftermath of October continues to be felt.\n\nQuah Su-ling, executive director of Ipco International and one of several parties involved in lawsuits linked to the forced selling of LionGold shares, was recently ordered by the High Court to pay up a $1.83 million debt to the Bank of East Asia owed from a share-margin facility, The Straits Times reported. Her lawyer had argued that it was difficult for her to pay up because her assets have been frozen as a result of the lawsuits.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Developing Asia as a whole (excluding Japan) should achieve gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 6.2 per cent this year and 6.4 per cent in 2015 after an expansion of 6.1 per cent last year, the ADB said in its annual Asian Development Outlook report published yesterday.\n\n\"Developing Asia is successfully navigating a challenging global economic landscape and is well positioned to grow steadily over the next two years,\" said ADB president Takehiko Nakao. \"Risks to the outlook have eased compared to the recent past, and policymakers in the region can manage them.\"\n\nAn improvement in the combined growth of the United States, the eurozone and Japan to 1.9 per cent this year and 2.2 per cent in 2015 from only one per cent last year will be offset somewhat by moderating growth in China whose economy slowed to 7.7 per cent in 2013, said the report.\n\nChina's slowdown is attributed to \"tightened credit growth, pared industrial overcapacity, deepening local government debt, rising wages, currency appreciation and the continuing shift in (official) development priorities away from quantity towards quality\". China is forecast grow by 7.5 per cent this year and 7.4 per cent in 2015. But the report cautioned that \"data on the recovery in major industrial economies have been mixed, pointing to the possibility that demand for the region's goods may be softer than envisaged. And, a further shock to global financial markets from changes in US monetary policy cannot be ruled out\".\n\nThe report casts a critical eye on aspects of development in emerging Asia, which contrast unfavourably with other regions such as Latin America. These include growing income inequality in the region and a failure on the part of some governments to address the problem.\n\n\"Fiscal policy can and should play a bigger role in promoting inclusive growth in Asia,\" said deputy chief economist Juzhong Zhuang on publication of the report while noting that there is a limited window of opportunity in which countries have time and \"fiscal space\" to act.\n\n\"Asian policymakers must act now to integrate inclusion targets into their budget planning to transition to a path where the benefits of growth are broadly shared,\" he said.\n\nWithout such action, future demand and consumption patterns will suffer and growth along with them, according to the ADB report. Over the past 15 years, \"more than 80 per cent of the region's population lived in countries with worsening Gini coefficients, a common measure of inequality. The same forces that enhanced growth in the region, globalisation, technological progress, and market reform now exacerbate inequality\", it said.\n\nDeveloping Asia \"lags other regions in public investment to promote equity. Public spending on education averages 2.9 per cent of GDP compared to 5.3 per cent in advanced economies, and 5.5 per cent in Latin America. The difference is starker for healthcare: 2.4 per cent in Asia versus 8.1 per cent in advanced nations and 3.9 per cent in Latin America\".\n\n\"Most of countries in developing Asia have relatively adequate fiscal space at present because of a long tradition of fiscal prudence,\" ADB principal economist Donghyun Park told The Business Times yesterday. \"But one of our key messages is that fiscal space today for much of Asia does not guarantee fiscal space tomorrow.\"\n\nRapidly ageing population in the region will require increased public spending on healthcare and social services and yet \"relative to other parts of the world, Asia's tax revenue to GDP ratio is low\", said Mr Park. \"We face large fiscal demands going forward and we need to expand our fiscal revenue base.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In practice, however, their divergence provides useful clues to the state of the manufacturing sector, suggesting that large firms have held up better than many feared, but that overall, activity remains subdued.\"\n\nAnalysts suggested a further explanation for the divergence, saying that conditions among large energy- intensive firms, to which the official PMI is more heavily weighted, appear to have held up better than others.\n\nPreliminary data shows that electricity grew by 8.5 per cent during the first 24 days of last month, up from growth of 5.5 per cent in February.\n\nThe mixed readings will do little to alleviate concerns over the Chinese economy following a recent string of corporate debt defaults. Recent data out of the world's second-largest economy has been worrying investors with clear signs of an acceleration in its slowdown.\n\nLast month, Premier Li Keqiang said the annual gross domestic product (GDP) target would remain unchanged at 7.5 per cent; analysts now say this objective is unlikely to be reached.\n\nThe government has signalled that it is ready to sacrifice growth to rebalance the economy, but it is unclear how much of a slowdown it is willing to bear.\n\nHSBC China economist Sun Junwei said yesterday: \"The Chinese manufacturing sector continues to lose steam. Despite improving new export orders, domestic weakness implies that the first quarter GDP is likely to have slipped below the annual growth target of 7.5 per cent.\"\n\nDetails of the sub-indices show that weakness comes mainly from depressed domestic demand.\n\nThere are also clear signs of inventory de-stocking: raw material purchases have slowed and finished-goods inventories have accumulated.\n\nBoth the output and input price sub-indices fell further below 50, the HSBC PMI showed.\n\nOn the brighter side, both PMIs indicate that foreign demand is of little concern; the new exports order index rebounded last month as did the employment component.\n\nLately, there has been increased speculation that China may soon unleash a new round of monetary stimulus to boost the economy. Premier Li said last week that necessary policies were in place and the government will push ahead with infrastructure investment.\n\nMonetary policy adjustments seem to have started in February. Interbank rates have fallen notably since then.\n\nLast week, two real estate developers were permitted to re-finance in the A share market, the first cases in nearly four years, given that certain developers in second-tier cities have shown signs of bankruptcy. Yesterday, official data showed that price rises for new homes in China slowed in March for the third straight month.\n\nLu Ting, an economist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, said: \"We don't expect a big stimulus package, but we expect the government to introduce some fiscal measures to stabilise growth.\"\n\nThe official Xinhua news agency on Monday also played down hopes of radical government moves, saying a massive economic stimulus package was unlikely.\n\nIt said in an analysis: \"With further shrinkage in China's growth on the cards in Q1, reform will be used to fend off economic slowdown rather than an economic stimulus.\"\n\nMeasures expected in the coming months include a 50-point cut in the required reserve ratio rate and further deregulation in the corporate sector.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The combined market cap of the top 10 per cent of stocks by market value grew by 3.98 per cent over the month, while the smallest 10 per cent of stocks registered just 0.3 per cent of growth.\n\nThe blue chip-dominated Straits Times Index (STI) gained 2.39 per cent in April to close at 3,264.71 yesterday.\n\nAmong STI stocks, the largest increase came from CapitaMalls Asia, whose market cap grew 23.5 per cent to $8.6 billion, after CapitaLand made an offer of $2.22 per share on April 14 - a 23 per cent premium on the previous close - with a view to delist the subsidiary.\n\nKeppel Corp fell the most among the 12 STI stocks that shed value month-on-month, shrinking 3.2 per cent to $19.1 billion.\n\nThe overall market capitalisation this month was boosted by two initial public offerings - PACC Offshore Services Holdings on the mainboard last Friday, and QT Vascular's Catalist listing on Tuesday.\n\nTogether, these added about $2.3 billion of market cap at the point of listing.\n\nTelco giant Singapore Telecommunications was bumped off its top spot by Prudential plc, with the latter's market cap growing by 24.5 per cent in April to $64 billion.\n\nThe secondary-listed counter, which trades in US dollars, last traded at US$20 on April 24, US$4 or 25 per cent higher than the month before.\n\nSome 113 companies were in the billion-dollar club in April, three more than in March. The combined market value of companies with market cap of $1 billion or more was $840.2 billion, around 88.4 per cent of the total market value.\n\nVoyage Research analyst Liu Jinshu said that while things looked better in April, he expects to see some volatility in May.\n\nSome investors, who subscribe to the \"sell in May and go away\" mantra, might make it a self-fulfilling prophecy, he said.\n\nMr Liu added that although penny stocks have been slower moving, he expects them to catch up if the STI continues to grow strongly.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Trading on the equity market continued as normal.\n\nA-HTrust prices new stapled securities\n\nASCENDAS Hospitality Trust (A-HTrust) has priced its $50 million placement of 73.53 million new stapled securities at the lower end of indications. The 68-cent issue price is a 3.5 per cent discount to the hotel trust's 70.5-cent adjusted volume weighted average price before the placement. Marketing indications for the deal was between 68 cents and 69.5 cents. Proceeds will be used to pay for the Osaka Namba Washington Hotel Plaza in Japan.\n\nQualified opinion issued on P99\n\nAUDITORS of P99 Holdings have issued a qualified opinion on the investment holding company formerly known as China Fashion Holdings, citing a lack of access to the now-deconsolidated unit Asia Sport Alliance (ASA). ASA was no longer considered under P99's control after Sept 30, 2013, so contributions from ASA prior to that could not be adequately audited, said auditor Moore Stephens. All other aspects of P99's financial statements were proper, the auditor said.\n\nPSL CEO and CFO step down\n\nENGINEERING group PSL Holdings said Foo Kah Lee has resigned as chief executive and executive director following a change in substantial shareholders of the company. Chief financial officer Ross Y Limjoco has also stepped down for the same reason. Meanwhile, former Nordic Group CFO Tang Yew Quan was appointed as a new executive director; and former RSM Chio Lim partner Chia Meng Ru was appointed new group financial controller and company secretary.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.
